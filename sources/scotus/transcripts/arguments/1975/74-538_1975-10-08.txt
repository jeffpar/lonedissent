ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, FREY:
the Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is here on writ of certiorari to review

a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
reversing respondent's conviction on the grounds that the
stolen credit cards he was convicted of possessing had been
obtained by postal inspectors during an illegal search of
responsent8s automobile and should have bean suppressed as
evidence at his trial,
I will state the case at some length, not because
the facts are particularly complicated but because they
demonstrate so convincingly that the decision of the court of
appeals was erroneous and should be reversed.
On August 17, 1972, Postal Inspector Frank Barbarick
received a telephone call from Awad Khoury, an informant who
had supplied accurate information to Barbarick on a number of
prior occasions.

The informant told Barbarick that respondent

Watson was in possession of a stolen Bank of America credit
card and planned to turn the card over to Khoury,
Later that day Khoury met with Barbarick and turned

4
over a credit card such as he had described»

The inspector

ascertained from the Bank of America that the credit card had
been, mailed three days earlier and had never reached its
intended customer.
The informant told Barbarick that he and respondent
had an agreements respondent would furnish the informant with
additional credit cards stolen from the mail, and the informant
would purchase airline tickets and merchandise with the cards.
Inspector Barbarick instructed th® informant to set up another
meeting with respondent zo obtain the additional credit cards.
Although there was sufficient time to have obtained a warrant
for respondent's arrest during the time that passed between
this initial contact and the actual arrest, the postal Inspector
made no attempt to do so.
After several postponements, a meeting was finally
..Id netween the informant and respondent at noon on the 23d
of August at a restaurant in Los Angeles.

At the designated

time, th® informant met and at a nearby table there were two
postal inspectors stationed.

Inspector Barbarick had instructed

the informant that if respondent were in possession of stolen
credit cards, th© informant should light a cigarette as a signal
to the surveilling agents in the restaurant.

The agents would

then activate a beeper which would inform agents positioned
outside the restaurant.
At the meeting the informant learned that respondent

s
had the credit cards outside in his car.
the agents in turn activated their signal.

He lit a cigarette and
Inspector Barbarick

and other agents entered the restaurant and placed respondent
under arrest for possession of stolen mail and specifically
for possession of the card 'that the informant had turned over to
Inspector Barbarick. six days earlier.
The inspectors escorted respondent out of the
crowded restaurant and searched him, but they did not find the
credit cards on his parson.
warnings.

Respondent was then given Miranda

Respondent who had previously been an informant for

Inspector Barbarick and who knew him well said in response to
the Miranda warnings, "Frank," — which was Barbarick1s first
name — "I understand my rights."

The inspector then asked

respondent where his automobile was located, and respondent
pointed to a car nearby.
inside?"

Then the inspector said, "Can I look

.and respondent said, "Go ahead."
Then the inspector said, "You know, if I find anything,

it is going to go against you."
Arid respondent said, "Go ahead, there is nothing in
there.w
Respondent then gave the inspector the keys which
opened the locked car and Inspector Barbarick and another
inspector searched the car and found under a floor mat an
enveloped containing two pieces of stolen mail, each with credit
cards inside them.

These two pieces of mail, together with —

6
these two credit cards, together with'the credit card supplied
six days earlier by the informant, formed the basis of the
indictment returned against respondent for possession of stolen
mail.
Prior to trial respondent moved to suppress the
stolen credit cards.

He mad© several arguments, first that

the informant was not a reliable informant, and therefore there
wa3 no probable cause to arrest respondent? second, that a
warrant was required for respondent’s arrest? and third, that
respondent’s consent to the search of his automobile was invalid
because he had not been told that he could withhold his consent.
The district court denied the motion and respondent’s trial
proceeded.
He was convicted by a jury on the two counts involving
the credit cards found under the, floor mat of his automobile.
He was acquitted on the count involving the credit card turned
over six days earlier by the informant to the inspector.
%

.? divided panel of the court of appeals reversed the conviction.
The majority concluded that the information gathered by
Inspector Barbarick from the informant was reliable, was
confirmed by physical receipt of a stolen credit card, that it
did provide probable cause to arrest respondent and therefor®
rejected that argument that respondent had made.
It held, however, that because the officers had not
sought or obtained a warrant for respondent8s arrest during the

7
six days between the acquisition of probable cans© and the
meeting at the restaurant, the arrest was unconstitutional.
Proceeding from that conclusion, the majority then
held that consent respondent gave to search his automobile
X

was defective.

It purported to adhere to the totality of all

th© circumstances test enunciated by this Court in

Schneekloth

v. Bustamonte, but stated nevertheless that the consent was
involuntary because respondent was in custody in violation of
the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTIONS

Do you think the court of appeals®

holding amounted to a statement that a respondent like the on©
here who had been illegally arrested could not under any
conceivable circumstances give a valid consent to a search
of this kind?
MR. FREY;

Well, 1 think the court of appeals did

not expressly put it in those words, but every single fact that
would bear on the actual voluntariness of respondent’s actions
tended to point toward voluntariness,

I think it must ba viewed

in effect upon analysis of the per se rule there would ba 'three
factors;

One, custody; two, illegal; and three, th® lack of a

specific Miranda type warning of a right to withhold consent,
although as I will argue later there was effectively a communica­
tion of the right to withhold consent in this case.
The cas© thus presents th© Cotart today with two
issues.

3

QUESTIONS

Excuse me» Mr. Frey.

The 'per s© rule»

do you think they made a par se rule both on the arrest factor
and on the consent, or just on the consent?
MR. FREYs

Well, the rule on the arrest issue would

turn on certain facts, I think.

In other words, it would turn

on the question of whether there was an opportunity, whether
in fact they had acquired probable cause, whether they had an.
opportunity subsequent to th© acquisition of probable cause
to obtain a warrant.

Th© rule then would be that an arrest is

illegal if they had acquired probable cause
the opportunity to get a warrant.

and had passed up

So in that sense I suppose

it’s a per se rule.
QUESTION:

Th® only fact determination left to be

made is on the time, is that not so?
MR. FREY:

I think it would be equivalent to th©

emergency doctrine for search warrants of homes, that is, the
✓

Government would be required to show exigent circumstances that
justified, the failure- to get a warrant.

Otherwise the arrest

would be unlawful.
QUESTION:

What case has held that a warrant must

be obtained simply because there is time to obtain it?
MR. FREY;

An. arrest warrant?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY:

No cas©.

QUESTIONS

So that they have established the rule

9
that if there is time to gat a warrant, an arrest without, a
warrant is invalid, is that not the holding here?
MR. FREY;

That’s correct.

And it is definitely a

QUESTION;

That’s a per s© rule, isn’t it?

MR. FREY;

Yes, it is a per se rule, although unlike

new rule»

the rule on -- the rule on the consent issue, you look at
three relatively concrete isolated and inflexible kind of facts,
and if you find those three facts, then there can’t he a valid
consent.

Here there is a factual inquiry to exigent circumstances

which can't be pinned down as quite specific or narrow inquiry,
but it is a per se rule one© you’ve gotten across the factual
threshold»
Now, the two questions that are presented to the
Court today, both the question regarding the need to obtain
a warrant for an arrest and the question regarding the ability
of one in custody and in illegal custody to consent to a search
are questions of great practical importance to everyday law
enforcement.
I believe, turning first to the arrest issue, that
it would be a considerable understatement to say that the
decision of the court of appeals represents a sharp break with
tradition and history.

The Federal rule, the rule in e§qh of

the 50 States, the common law rule, the rule I dare say that each
of you learned as black

letter law during your first year of

10
criminal law course in law school is that a law enforcement
officer may make a warrantless arrest for a felony on the basis
of probable cause, at least so long.as the arrest doss not
entail an entry into a dwelling or similar place..
This proposition has been recognised in numerous
decisions of this Court during the past 50 years, from the
Carroll case to last term8s decision in Carstain v. PughIt is reflected in section 3061 in title 18 of the United States
Code, which authorized Inspector Barb&rick to arrest respondent
without a warrant on th© very circumstances of this case.
Neither w© nor respondent have been able to find a single case
in the entire anals of Anglo-American jurisprudence holding
otherwise.
Th® court of appeals relied on the Coolidge case,
but I think it's quit© clear that Coolidge do©s not support th©
conclusion it reached.

Coolidge was clearly and repeatedly

focused upon fhs problem of an entry info a dwelling or similar
place, a privacy invasion of that nature in connection with an
arrest.

We have no similar ingredient in the present case.
Given this background, then, I submit that even if

it were otherwise desirable, this Court would not be frme to
overturn this consistent and heavy weight of precedent and to
hold that this time for th® first time that warrants are
required as a constitutional matter.

Even if th® Court did

consider itself free as a jurisprudential matter to adopt, th®

11
radical constitutional departure embodied in the holding of
the court of appeals , there are good reasons of policy and
practice that counsel against, such a step»

And we have made

th.es© arguments in our brief, and we advance them without
intending in any way to minimize the seriousness of being
arrested.

We recognize that an arrest is an intrusion into

individual liberty of substantial dimensions.

We recognise that

this Court has repeatedly looked carefully at the circumstances
surrounding an arrest and has required that fch© officers have
substantial justification amounting to probable cause in order
to make a lawful arrest.
The question here before us is whether a warrant
should be required.
Now, I think there is one structural difference
which I would like to mention this morning between a search
of a dwelling,which this Court has recognized in the absence
of exigent circumstances does require a warrant,

and an arrest.

If a warrantless search is made and items are seized • or indeed
if nothing is seized, there is no judicial accounting that
necessarily takes place as a result of that action.
never come to the attention of fch© courts.

It may

Indeed, this is

the problem, I think, that underlies the whole rational® of
the warrant requirement, the reason that has impelled this
Court to impose a warrant requirement, is to insure some
degree of judicial supervision.

Only upon a motion for

12
suppression of evidence or return of property which may be mad©
many months later by the person who was th© subject of the
search is there judicial review»

Quite the contrary is the case

where an individual is arrested, the law both federally and
in the States and as a result of Gerstain v. Pugh.requires a
reasonably prompt judicial determination of the adequacy of
the grounds underlying the arrest.

This to us is a substantial

counterweight neutralising to some extent the desirability that
otherwise might be viewed to exist for obtaining a warrant prior
to arrest.
There are also a lot of practical problems with
requiring an arrest warrant and this case 1 think illustrates
very well some of those problems.

Even when, suspicion focuses

on a suspect, th© decision whether or not to arrest them is
often not made immediately.

Instead further investigation is

undertaken , either with th© goal of securing additional evidence
or alternatively of demonstrating the suspect's innocence.
Her© an effort was mads to obtain further confirmation by
catching respondent red-handsel with stolen credit cards if it
was possible to do so. and indeed it was successful in this case.
Now, respondent seeks to explain away our arguments
that it is undesirable to force officers to seek warrants as
soon as they have acquired probable caus© by saying that, well,
the police can wait, they don't hav® to acquire a warrant right
away.

Th© only thing they have to do is get a warrant before

13
making the arrasto
But I think that argument doesn't work, because as in
this case, one© the decision is made to arrest, the need often
is sudden to do so.

Hera, in other words, the investigation

was proceeding, 1 think it's quite apparent from my recitation
of the facts that no decision had been mads whether or not to
arrest the respondent or when to arrest him until the signal
was given in the restaurant which indicated that he was in
possession of additional stolen credit cards.

At that point

ha was ~ the officers had probable cause to believe that he
was then and there committing a new crime* Now to say that
because they had failed to get a warrant previously they were
powerless to arrest him seams to me a very undesirable result.
Indeed, even if the innovation

of the court of appeals in the

constitutional law of arrests were correct sis a general
proposition, it was wrongly applied to this case because her©
there was probable cause, fresh probable cause to arrest th®
respondent for a fresh offense.
I would like to turn to the question of validity
of respondents consent to th© search of his automobile, and I
hark back to some of the facts of th® case as I stated them
earlier.

The respondent knew the arresting officer, he was on

a first-name basis with him.

Th® situation was casual,even

friendly, and the dialogue indicated a request for a consent
to search, a consent followed by a warning that if anything

14
were found, it would go against the respondent, followed by
a repeated almost demand that the inspector search the
automobile.

It's obvious from those facts that the respondent

not only willingly consented to the search, but that he believed
it would benefit him because the inspector would fail to find
the stolen mail -that respondent had hidden under the floor mat
of his car,
It6s also clear, I think, from the facts, although
the court of appeals says otherwise, that respondent knew he
didn't have to consent.

Again, under the holding of this

Court in Schneckloth, an actual concrete warning with respect
to the right to withhold consent is not necessary and its
presence or absence is simply a factor to be taken into account.
Presumably that means that it is to b® taken into account
realistically on the facts of this case,and where an arrested
person is practically insisting that his car be searched, I
think it's difficult to find that there was not a voluntary
consent.
QUESTION5

Wasn’t the holding in Schneckloth

limited to the noncustodial situation?
MR, FREY:

Absolutely, and I am turning to that next.

It is true that Schneckloth explicitly refrained from passing
on the custodial situation.

However, six courts of appeals

that we have been able to find, the Second, Fourth, Fifth,
Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Circuits, all have passed on that

15
issuer and indeed the court below in this case said that
consent alone, just like, the lack of a warning of a right to
withhold consent, is not. a per se factor that would foe
automatically dispositive of the validity

of the consent,

but custody is a factor to foe taken into account.

It seems

to raa clear that if a person in custody can. give a valid
confession as Miranda recognises he can, that a parson in
custody can give a valid consent to a search.

Of course, if

he has been taken away and he has spent six hours in the back
room of a police station, that would foe a significant factor
in evaluating the voluntariness of his consent.
So I think that it is not necessary to dwell at
substantial length on the factor of custody because it seems
to me that the overall reasoning and structure of the Schneckloth
decision and the principles that underlay it apply equally to
the factor of custody'-,

It is possible to look at custody and

to determine the circumstances

of custody and from that

make a decision whether or not the consent that's given to a
search is a voluntary consent.
for a par

s®

And there is, I think, no need

rule and the courts of appeals seem to be in

universal agreement on that question.
QUESTION:

I assume that this is all a very short

time, from' the time h® was picked up —
MR. FREY %
minutes.

1 think the record indicates about 15

The search itself was about 15 minutes, but he was

16
removed from the restaurants arrested, told what h® was
arrested for, searched, and then the conversation promptly
ensued.
QUESTION?

I mean, the time of his consent was very

shortly after he was arrested.
MR. FREY;
consent.

Right.

It was an on-the-street, prompt

And, of course, ths period of time that passed would

be. significant; in the Rothman case in toe Ninth Circuit which
was cited by ths court of appeals and is cited by my opponent,
several hours had passed during which repeated requests had
been mad© to the suspect in custody to permit the search of
his bag and h© had refused over and over and finally he was
told that th® officers would g@fc a warrant, although in fact
they hadn't the least basis to get a warrant, and at that point
he said, "What toe heck, go ahaad and search it.K
Well, that's quit© a different case from what we hav©
here.
So turning from the fact - of

custody alone to the

question of th© illegal nature of the custody -- and I am
assuming arguendo for purposes of this argument that respondent's
custody was illegal

it's clear that th® illegality is in

almost all cases totally irrelevant to th® kind of voluntariness
analysis that was applied in Schneekloth for assessing the
validity of a consent.

The voluntariness of respondent9s

consent could not possibly hav® been affected by what h© didn't

1?

know, to wit, that the court of appeals two years later would,
hold that his arrest was illegal for lack of a warrant,
Since the legality or illegality of the arrest
couldn’t have impinged on his consciousness or indeed on th©
consciousness of the postal inspectors under the circumstances
of tills case, unless th© Court is simply going to throw away
th© voluntariness analysis, the illegality cansfc play a role
in that analysis.
So in connection with th® consent, I think th© only
tolerable issue that really exists is th© fruit of the
poisonous tree question, and that is a question that was not
adverted to at all or r@ii.ed upon in any way by the court of
appeals.

In other words, th® argument is whether or not th©

consent was voluntary if it was the product of an illegal
arrest par th© deterrent purposes of the Fourth Amendment
exclusionary rule might be served by treating th® consent as
an invalid fruit.

W© think such an argument is untenable on

th® facts of this case, and we think that result is clear from
this Court’s decision in Brown v„ Illinois.
In Brown the Court asked the question whether th©
statements flier© obtained by an illegally arrested individual
after h© had been given Miranda warnings but during a period
of illegal detention were obtained by exploitation of th©
illegality of his arrest.

The Court rejected any but-for rul©

that said simply it would be enough for th© defendant to show

18

that he might not have made the statement or her© he might not
have consented had he not bean arrested.
at exploitation of illegality.

Instead it looked

It looked at the behavior of

the officers in the case, particularly,, said the Court at
page .13 of the slip

opinion, BTh® purpose and flagrancy of

the official misconduct.”
Sow, in the present ease, there was not and there
could not have been any exploitation of the illegality -that
existed in the present case.

The illegality, if there was any,

was not that they had no right to arrest him as such, not that
there was not adequate justification for taking Mr. Watson
into custody, but that they did not possess a warrant.
Mow, of course, their possession or nonpossession, of
a warrant can have no possible bearing on whether or not a
consent would b© given to search of the automobile.

Consequently,

it seems to me quit© clear that there could have been in the
circumstances of this case no exploitation of an illegality for
the purpose of obtaining a consent, and that under Brown, I
think, is the part.ine.nt criterion.

So X think in this ease

we have the consent as an independent, voluntary act 'untainted
by any illegality that there may have been in the arrest.
Finally, in connection with the consent issue I
would like to point out that the respondent did not testify
at: the suppression hearing.

He never got up and said one word

about the involuntariness, one word about his state of mind in

19
granting the consent.

There was no contradiction, of the

inspector's version of the events»
Now, unless there is to he a per se rule? I think
that a defendant is going to have a very difficult time
establishing involuntariness without getting on the stand? and,
of course? there are no self-incrimination problems because
his testimony at the suppression hearing could not be used
against him in the ferial.

So \m don*f. have a Fifth Amendment

justification for not talcing the stand? and I submit that
ordinarily unless the other evidence demonstrates plainly that
the consent was involuntary, that the absence of testimony by
a defendant would be a very significant factor in the voluntari­
ness inquiry.
For all of these reasons, wa request this Court to
reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and to reinstate
respondent5 s conviction»»
I will reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well, Mr. Frey.

Mr. Kasatir.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D„ NASATIR
ON BEHALF OF TBE RESPONDENT
MR. NASATIRs
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Th© last part of petitioner’s argument in this

etas©, I think? states and clearly states how the petitioner has
misstated th© issue in this case.

20

The issue in this case is not whether the police had
time to get a warrant# and just because they waited six days
they had to gat a warrant for petitioner *s arrest.

The issue

in this particular case is that the prosecution failed to carry
its burden as it had# as it didn't produce a warrant# failed
to carry its burden on these particular facts and in these
particular circumstances.
Of course# it failed to carry its burden on the
two crucial points —■
QUESTION:

Failed to carry its burden where# in th©

district court or the court ©f appeals?
SIR, NASATXR:

In 'th® district court and th® court of

appeals.
QUESTION:

Th© district court ordered suppression?

MR. NASATXR:

Ho# ssscusa me.

Just in th® district

court at th® hearing.
QUESTION:

You mean just in th.® court of appeals#

don't you?
MR. NASATXR:

I mean just in th® district court.

In th© district court at th® hearing# the prosecution had th©
burden of proving, one# that the arrest was legal and proper
and was made with probable cans®# sine© they didn't have an
arrest warrant# and, two# that the consent to search was
voluntary because th® respondent was in custoday at the time.
So on each of those two points# they failed to carry their

21
burden.
QUESTIOHs

Welle did the district court suppress or

not?
MR. NASATXR:

The district court did not suppress

the evidence.
QUESTION:

So the district court found in favor of

the Government.
MR. NAS ATX Rs

That is correct.

Of course, the district court didn't have th® benefit
of th® Schnsckloth decision at that time, it didn't have the
benefit of the Brown decision at that time, and it didn't have
the benefit of seme of the later cases which has clarified this
Court's thinking on that very issue.

And I think the district

court erroneously, and I think oven th® court of app®ais
erroneously considered that this was a probable cans© arrest
and the probable cause was sufficient.

But, of course, that was

decided against us and although we assert it as an alternative
ground, that is not our primary issu-as.
What 2 would like to male© clear to the Court today is
what is th® issua in this case and what was tha decision of th©
court of appeals of th® Ninth Circuit.

Th® Ninth Circuit did

not establish a per se rule as to all situations that an arrest
warrant, if you had time to get one, you must obtain on©, or
the police must obtain on©.

What th© court of appeals did was

said in this particular situation where Inspector Barbarick

22
waited six days, where there was time to get a warrant arid where
the prosecution in carrying its burden could act point to one
exigent circumstance where a warrant would be excused, that ia
this particular case a warrant is not excused, and a warrant
was necessary.
QUESTION %

What do you do about the Government's

position that it was exigent at the -time that ha was committing
th® last crime?
MR. NASATXR;

It might have been exigant at the- time

h® was committing the last crime.
QUESTIONs

MR. NASATXR:

Th® credit cards war® in his car.

MR. NASATXRs

Th© court found they were in his

constructiva possession* yes* vour Honor.

But what Inspector

Barbarick — and this 1 think is crucial — when he saw that
lit cigarette, ha didn't trust that lit cigarette.

He didn't

feel that there was a new crime being committed or he would have
arrested on probable cause for that new crime which he had an

24
absolute right to do.

There was a crime being commit:tad in his

presence, there is a reasonable possibility of escape.

But what

he did, h© relied on a crime that was committed six days ago.
And I think this issue is important because of the straw man
which the Solicitor General has set up in this case.

Ha said

all the deleterious effects that a warrant -would have.

H© said

*

that a warrant would encourage an investigation of

— that no

on<a would leave the polio© free to conduct a further investiga­
tion and to collect more evidence to be sura -that they had the
right man, that they could collast more information and b© sure
that they could corroborata the informant. Thatthey could collect
more information so that they could clear innocent people.
But on these fasts you can a®© what human ruiture is,

and all case law has required warrants in these situations
where a policeman has time to reflect.

That’s correct, your Honor.

Well, I can cits the Fourth Amendment.

Ho, you said cases.

cases which —

MR. NASATIRs

Absolutely searches.

to say that a search of items, of objects, ar© more of an

That’s all it is.
QUESTION %

The only thing an arrest is.

But there have been numerous cases from

26
this court that hold probable causa is sufficient for an arrest
of a person, haven't there?
MR» NAS&TXR:

There have been probable cause where

there are exigent circumstances, certainly.

And in ©very case

where they have held that an arrest is proper, there have been
exigent circumstances.
Now, in a couple of casas -QUESTION %

What are those cases.

MR. NASATXRs

In Trvplano, for example, the officer

saw an ongoing crime committed exactly in their presence which
is a situation that Mr. Justice Ifersha.ll spoke about, a crime
bring committed in their presence, which they had a perfect
right to stop and to arrest the person without a warrant even
whan he was on his premises.

They looked through that window,

they saw the man operating a still.
QUESTIONi

X*m familiar with that case.

MR,, NASATIRs

They had a search warrant in that case

and they presented the facts as to probable causa.
QUESTION?

There have been many cases in which the

validity of the arrest has been assumed.
MR. NASATIR:

Exactly, your Honor.

And Mr. Justice

White in & dissent, and I don’t ha.v® the case to cite to you
at the. present fcira©, but in a dissent he Bays that really it
has been assumed that arrests have been made with exigent
circumstances because in actuality this is an unusual case.

21
In most cases in arrest situation., there are exigent circumstances
which exist»

Exigent circumstances apply to movable objects,

and what is more movable than a human being?
there wasn*t a movable human being.

But in tills case

In -this case the officer

knew h© could gat ahold ©£ Mr. Watson.

He in fact set up a

meeting where he knew Mr. Watson would show up* which Mr.
Watson did.

H@ had control over Mr. Watson.

H@ didn't rely

upon a crime that was being committed in his presence; he
relied upon facts that occurred six days prior to tills»
QUESTION:

How did he know that h© was going to be

present except that he was invitee or that the appointment had
bean made?
MR» HASATIR:

Well» certainly he didn5fc know.

QUESTION;

Watson showed up* his feeling was confirmed.
danger of Mr. Watson escaping.

There was no

You see* your Honor* what has

happened in this case and this case alone is that the prosecution
just failed to carry its burden.

If they had asked Mr.

Barba rick or if Mr. Barbarick had really felt that ha was
arresting for an ongoing crime, he should have said so.

If

Mr. Barbarick had felt that there was danger of escape of Mr.
Watson, ha could have said so.

If Mr. Barbarick had felt that

he was protecting the safety of property or other persons and

28
he had to do that by arresting Mr. Watson? he could have said
so.

He never said so.

What he did say was he arrested him for

a crime that was aIk days old.

What he didn't do are all of

the things that the Solicitor General says an investigator will
/

do if h@ is given the time to reflect.

He didn't check out his

informant; h® didn't look for fingerprints on the credit card;
he didn't look for th© innocence of Mr. Watson? he didn't
try any other investigative techniques•

He sat back and tried

to set up a situation where he caught Mr. Watson "dirty® with
other credit cards.
But then when he saw the signal from his own
informant? obviously he didn't trust that and relied upon a
situation which was six days old.
Wa are not talking about time in this ease? time only.
What we are talking about is an opportunity to obtain a warrant
without exigent circumstances.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you that if ho said?”I

am arresting you for having a credit card in your possession
as of this time?” everything would ba all right?
MR. NASATIR:. I wouldn't concede that there would be
probable cause in that situation? your Honor? but I would
concede that that would be an

exigent circumstance if there

was probable cause.
QUESTION:

So the only problem is he didn't say that.

MR. NA8ATXR:

No.

The only problem is he didn’t

29

rely on his informant.

He relied upon a situation which was

days old.
Now, he could have said he thought Mr. Watson was
going to escape.

But. he didn't.

or he would have said so.
other things.

Obviously he didn't think so

And he could have said any of the

But obviously he didn't think so.

This Court has said many times that we want to
involve the judiciary and magistrates in our machinery for
search and saiaura.
QUESTIONS

If every tiling is so obvious —* do you

really mean that?
MB. MASATIRs

In the decisions that I've read in this

Court, I think, your Honor, that ©vary Justic© sitting on the
Court has said that we want to encourages warrants, we want to
encourages involvement of the judiciary in arrest situations,
ws want to interpose a magistrate's detached opinion between
the officer who is actively involved in ferreting out crime
and whose ego and everything in his personality is involved,
w® want to interpose a neutral, detached magistrate to help
him out, to se-a if h© has probable cause, to confirm probable
cauqe, and to issue a legal process so that a person can be
arrested.

In many arrest situations, and the reason why this

litigation has not reached this Court is because usually in an
arra&t situation it's an easy burden for the 'prosecution to
carry.

And as Mr. Justice Whit© said in the dissent I spoke

30

aboutt it hasn't basm litigated because people assume exigent
circumstances in most arrest situations.
But what you haw her® are no exigent circumstances.
And what you have her© is this is maybe the ons case where you
hearken back to the Fourth amendment and you say that the
seizure of a person is more important# or at least just as
important, as the seizure of an object.

You see, Coolidge

would '/man -- if w® w©r@ to require a warrant to arrest a body#
a person# to deprive a person of his liberty, we could say# well,
you can't seize the ear in Coolidge because there is no warrant
but you sure could seize the driver if he was sitting behind
the wheel, which seems to me incongruous, and I don't think
that this Court ever meant to differentiate between searches
and seizures.
&nd why# we must ask ourselves# does the Solicitor
General place so much emphasis on an arrest on private property?
One© again# do wa extol privat® property or possessions over
the actual person# over the actual liberty of the human being?
QUESTIONs

Well# certainly, on® reason for

distinguishing private property is that is th& fact situation
which was deemed important in Coolidg® as to the situs of the
car.
MR, NASATIR:

Right.

And -til® only reason that it

was deemed important in Coolidge # and the only reason private
property is deemed important in any situation, as th© Kata

.

31
case makes clear, your Honor, is because of the interest that
people have in their property and in that privacy.

There is no

if nobody was involved,, if no person was involved in that,
private property situation in Coolidge, we wouldn’t car© about
it, we wouldn’t be worried about it.
QUESTIONS

So when the person, is —

What do you mean if no person ware

involved in that — you mean that there had been nobody at
home it would have been perfectly all right to search the horn?
MR. NASATIR;

No.

If no on© owned -that car, like

an abandoned carp if it was an abandoned car.
an interest in it.

If no on® had

If no on® owned that home or lived there.

A harm is only a shell around a body.

Katz made clear that

what you are talking about when you are talking about the
protection of privacy and property is the person who owns it,
who has an interest in it.

Those are our reasons for standing,

those are our reasons for the protection of the judiciary in
these situations at all, is that person.
The difference between this situation and why it
hasn’t been brought up in many cases before this Court is
because usually the police have an excuse, a justification
for arresting a parson
QUESTION?

Where do you get your authority for these

broad statements that what police usually do?

Right out of

the thin blue.
MR. NASATIR s

Mo.

The only authority that I have is

32
Mr. Chief Justice White's statement that this has never been
litigated because people —. or not litigated much is because
people assume that there are exigent circumstances arid —
QUEST-ION:

Why don’t you cite that instead of

bringing it out of the air.

Why don't you cite the case rule

that the usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without
a warrant when believed by the officer upon reasonable cause
to have been guilty of a felony.
MR. NASATIRs

Certainly that's the usual rule, but

there must h© exigent circumstances.
QUESTIONs

I don't sea® any exigent circumstances

in what I just quoted to you.

QUESTIONS

I would like to hear you on fch© consent

point.
MR. NASATIR:

And I*d like to talk to you about it,

your Honor.
Your Honor, in this type of situation, since the
officer did not find the credit cards on the parson or did
not believe his informant’s signal, obviously what h© wanted
to do is set up a situation where h® could arrest Mr. Watson
with the credit cards on him.,

Be patted him down, he* searched

him, h© didn’t have the credit cards.

Then he advised him

of his Miranda rights immediately after taking him out of the
restaurant, and the reason h© took him out, I think, is
important, that things were getting excited in 'the restaurant,
that things were getting confused in the restaurant, that it
was a confusing, exciting situation.
QUESTION!

Why do you say that, he did not believe

the informant when the informant lit a cigarette?
MR. NASATIR;

Because ha didn’t rely on it.

Hs rolled on the information that he had received six days
earlier.
QUESTION^

But it was that that triggered his

approach to the respondent, wasn’t it, and the arrest?

MR» NASATIR;
QUESTION;

Is it very likely?

MB. NASATXR;
QUESTION;

Yes, it does.

It's possible.

The credit card had been handled by

first the informant, then by the detectives, plus other people.
MR. NASATIR;

In careful police work the detective

wouldn’t have handled it, of course, so it would have just
bean handled

— if the informant5s facts war® true, it would

have just been handled by th© informant and the respondent.
So that the fingerprints still would have been there if
Inspector Barbarick had used those six days to check those
facts out,
In th© consent situation he was placed in custody,
handcuffs were placed upon him, he was given his Miranda rights,

37
Ilis Miranda rights# of course# do nothing to vindicate his
Fourth Amendment rights# as was made clear by Brown. So the
first analysis 1 think is if you hold that the arrest was
illegal because of the failure to obtain a warrant in this
unusual circumstances# or because the prosecution failed to
carry its burden of showing exigent circumstances to excuse
that warrant# then it's certain under these facts that this
was the fruit of that illegal arrest.

clearly no warning that would attenuate the taint that was —

What was it that he said to the police

What exactly did your

client say?
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

My client said yes.

MR. NASATIR;

That is consent, your Honor, but is it

voluntary?
QUESTION:

After he said# "Whatever we find may be

used against you#" is that correct?
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And being told that# after the Miranda

warning, he said, "Go right ahead."
MR. NASATIR:

That's correct.

That does not add up to consent?

Not to my mind, not in this situation.

QUESTION;

Well* what would you need for consent,

MR. NASATIR:

QUESTION;

Ho, what you would, need for consent
Mr. Watson —

I thought the warning was he was going to

use what we find in the car.
MR. NASATIR:

That was the warning about what would

be done with it, but there was no warning of his right to
refuse.

The fact of it being used against him does not

indicate that ha had a right to refuse.

And it5s always

intriguing in the Miranda situation that you tell a parson
that he doesn't have to talk to you and then you immediately
start asking him questions.

How, what is he to assume from

But there is three analysis — and what the court of
appeals did in the case below in that totality of circumstances
first, it can b© analyzed under fch© '"fruits" doctrine, as
stated in Brown, to protect the Fourth Amendment rights.

But

to protect the Fifth Amendment rights involved in this case,
what the court of appeals did is consider both sides of the
coin, which is, I think, the correct analysis under this
Court’s opinion.

They considered the effect of the possible

coercion on the respondent; they also considered the police
conduct»
QUESTIONS

You say to protect the Fifth. Amendment

rights? do you mean the privilege
MR. NASATIR:

against self-incrimination?

Privilege against self-incrimination

and the right to due process.
QUESTIONS

Oh, I didn’t, realize that was involved

here.
MR. NASATIR:

I think it is involved here.

It's

a custody situation, it'/> a situation where the police had in
effect extracted the words "I consent" from my client.

Under

that situation, it is a Fifth Amendment analysis.
QUESTION:

You mean when he said, "I consent," he’s

incriminated himself?
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

Under that analysis, yes.

And also —

Under- that analysis, yes, but under any

other analysis that has ever been supported by any judicial
decision?

Honorf where they say that an intercepted conversation is the
same as an intercepted —
QUESTIONs

But that’s a Fourth Amendment casa»

MR. NASATXRs
QUESTION?

That is a Fourth Amendment case.

Well, I thought you said that if the

police officer says to your client.

"Will you let me go in your

car," and he says, "Yes, 1 will," that his statement, "Yes, I
will," incriminates himself.
MR. NASATIR;

It incriminates himself, but the main

argument, of course is the Schneckloth voluntariness argument.
QUESTIONS

But tell me just why you think it

incriminates him under our cases.
MR. NASATIRs

Because it's a response where he

doesn’t have to give one tending to incriminate himself, leading
to evidence that will incriminate himself by his own statement.
Mien he says, “I consent,..-” that allows the officer to get evidence
from the automobile.
But also, your Honor, obviously the Fifth Amendment
analysis goes to the voluntariness question.

But what the

court of appeals in this case was saying is that you can't
ignore -the situation which brought about the custody in
determining the totality of the circumstances when you are

42

looking at the voluntariness question under the Fifth Amendment.
And in not ignoring the situation which brought about the
custody, they took a look at the police conduct as well as its
affect on that person, and under that analysis, you can apply
to the facts of any case, arid certainly it * s not a per se
rule as to consent.

It allows the court and courts in general

to look at all the circumstances, including the situation which
brought about the consent, as well as that situation's effect
on the person and its voluntariness,
QUESTION:

Mr. Nasafcir, do you think this consent

could have been exculpatory in the minds of your client?

In

other words, he seemed confident the police would find nothing.
If the police found nothing, they would not have arrested him.
I'd like a confession in that respect.

Isn't it if one

consents to a search, don't you think the chances are that he
thinks nothing will be found that incriminates him?
MR. NASATIR:

Mr. Justice Blackmun — excuse me,

Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION?.

I am complimented.

MR. NASATIR;

I am sorry.

My client was sitting

down to dinner one minute and was arrested and handcuffed the
next.

He was then given, rights which related to his fight not

to incriminate himself, and then immediately asked the question
that led to his incrimination.

Under those circumstances,

certainly human beings react in a variety of different ways,

and one of those ways might be false bravado.

Certainly the

way that human beingsreact is not to look at the officer xn the

usually react.

That's not the way human beings

Sometimes some of them react as did Mr.

Watson here* obviously* with false bravado rather than with
informed awareness of his right to refuse to consent.

If it

had been certainly a lawyer under arrest or someone who was
informed of his rights* he would have reflectively said* "I
refuse to consent to a search of my automobile»'3
QUESTION:

You are arguing that ‘the Constitution

requires a policeman, to protect a man in this situation from
what you call his urge to engage in false bravado.
MR., NASATIR:

Only to adequately inform him of his

choices* your Honor. Only to make sure that, h© is awar© of
what his choices are and that one of those choices will result
in his keeping the officer out of that automobile.

QUESTION:

What's the basis for your making that

statement that he didn’t know about his rights?

I think that this case shows -the propriety and the
reasons why warrants should be required.

Without requiring

warrants in a case such as this, there will never be an
incentive for the police to get warrants in an arrest situation

Under those

circumstances, the prosecution in this case did not carry its
burden on either issue»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGHER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Frey?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY;

One or two brief points, Mr, Chief Justice.

This flaw in the question of the basis for respondent’s
arrest, Inspector Barbarick never denied that he was arresting
for the other purposes.

He simply announced at the tiro® hs

made tha arrest and h@ testified .at the suppression hearing
that -the arrest was mad© on the basis of the old credit card.
Of course, at that point he hadn’t yet found the other credit
cards, which might explain why he was bating it on fch© old
credit card.
QUESTION;

You don't test the validity of an

arrest

by what ultimately it turns up, any more than you do the
search.

Whether or not he had the credit cards has nothing

to do with the reason he made the arrest.

47
MR. FREYi

It wouldn't affect whether or not ha had

probable cause, but the point I want to make is that even if
he subjectively believed he was arresting for the old credit
card., the existence of probable cause with respect to the
additional stolen credit cards would support the arrest.

And

there are several cases that hold that that I would like to
call to the Court's attention in light of the argument that
has been made.
In United States v. Martinez, a Second Circuit,
decision, 465 F.2& 79, and Ramirez v. Rodriguez,. 467 F„2d 822,
a 'Tenth Circuit decision, there are soma others, but the point
is there that the officer believes h© is arresting for one
offense for which he does not have probable cans© but in fact
the facts known to him gives him probable cause to .arrest for
a different offense, th© arrest is lawful.
Similarly, if an officer is proceeding under a
warrant which turns out to b© invalid, the Court then looks
to see whether probable cause existed for the arrest and, indeed,
that was the analytical approach taken in the Coolidge ease by
this Court.
Now, also as a practical matter, th® suggestion is
that in the vast majority of cassas this warrant requirement
would not apply, because in most cases there would be a danger
of ©scape or some tiling of that sort.

But, of course, there are

holdings in the search and seizure area that exigent circumstances

48
at the moment you undertake, the search may not be enough to
support the search if you had an opportunity prior thereto
to obtain a warrant,

A case that conies immediately to mind

is Vale v, Louisiana in which it was clear once Vale was
arrested on the doorstep of his house that there were indeed
exigent circumstances for searching his house,

Yet the Court

said that couldn’t justify the failure to obtain a search
warrant before going.

So that the logic of respondent's

principle would have a substantially broad impact and it's not
just a very narrow, small category of cases that would be
affected.
As for the desirability of getting, the courts
involved in this seems to ms that that runs contrary to the
Robinson case which recognized that there were certain
principles in the law of arrest that were well established
and that it was undesirable to disrupt those principles and to
introduce a whole new realm of litigation.
Finally? on the false bravado point, the record
shows that the search actually took 15 minutes before the
envelope was found. It certainly was not obvious to Mr. Watson
that the inspectors wouId find the envelope.
I have no tiling further.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.
Thank you? gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:58 a„m., argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
