ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. HAGOPIAN, ESQ.,
OM BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HAGOPIAN *

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
The basic underlying issue in the merits of this
case is whether a defendant in a criminal proceeding has a
right to a trial by jury7 when he's charged upon an offense
in which he faces a maximum prison sentence! in excess of six
months,
In the instant case, the defendant, Richard Ludwig,
was denied a right for trial by jury in the first instance,
and he was convicted in the first tier of the Massachusetts
court system, and fee took an appeal — whatever that word
might mean — to the second tier in the Massachusetts system.
At that time he presented a motion to dismiss,
based on the grounds of double jeopardy, and also on the
grounds that his first trial %/as an error, that there war®
errors in the first trial.

I don't know what type of motion

to dismiss that is, but, leaving that aside, that's what
Massachusetts calls it, some sorb of a motion to dismiss.
In the second-tier proceedings, he waived his right

4
for a trial by jury and that was on my sdvlc© as counsel to
prevent a mooinsss issue from arising®

That decision took

plac© prior to this Court's decision in Costaralli vs
Massachusetts e and I exercised ny best judgment as to what I
thought the state of the law was at that time.
Ludwig was convicted by a judge? eventually took an
appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Courtr which
took th© position that he was not entitled to a trial by jury
in th© first instance»

That this Court had not made that

clear in Duncan vs» Lewisiana and subsequent decisions? they
alleged that the state of the law is in a flux»
They did not, apply the Fourteenth Amendment in the
absence of any prior decisions by this Court®
This case comes here on appeal s and although ‘the
Commonwealth has not raised itP I think that there is some*”
what of a problem in the jurisdiction of this Court®
At least in view of Costarelli. in a certain sens©* when
Mr» Ludwig took an appeal from the first tier to the second
tier* he vacated th© judgment®
Mow. let roe see if I can draw an analogy here which
will make it a little bit clearer* what l*m talking about®
In & single-tier system -C'UESTXON:

At that point* at the first tier* if

there w®r© conviction «and a sentence of imprisonment imposed*
and then a mo» took it on appeal# does he go to prison —

5

MRo HAGOPIANs

No, he doesn't.

automatically as a matter of law0

It’s vacated

The judgment is vacated»

But that's subject to several limitations.
this %

One is

he also may loss his license, which is in Ludwig's

case,
Nov?, I would suppose that that's not part of the
judgment, in the sens® that the judge doesn't write down on
the complaint; but the statute says whoever is convicted down
in ih© district court, the clerk of the court sends a notice
to the registry, and the registry yanks his license.
To me that's part of the judgment.

It’s a criminal

punishment to be imposed upon him,
QUESTIONS

Yes, but. the judgment doesn't ©xist

any more,
MR, HAGGPIAN:
license.

But his revocation exists, of his

That is in effect.

And that is a penalty that’s

being imposed because he's convicted of a criminal offense.
That's not a civil sanction, it's a criminal sanction,
QUESTIONS

But he hasn't been convicted if it's

sat aside,
QUESTIONS Well, whatever the theory may be, the law
of Massachusetts is that even after it's set aside his
license is revoked; is that what you're tailing us?

MR, HAGOPIAN:

That's quite correct.

And it's

because of «— it arises out of the criminal offense.

It's

6
siot a civil sanction, it's a penalty that*s imposed»
If you read Boyd vs Q United States, and those
forfeiture cases, where they also talc© the forfeit of goods»
of an automobile, because it’s been used in a heroin case»
QUESTION? Well, without reading anything, you're
telling us that, -fee law of Massachusetts is that a conviction
in the district court, even after it's set aside, has — in
a driving case of this kind — has the collateral consequence
of depriving a person of his driver's license?
MR° HAGOPIANj

That's correct»

There's no question

■about that»
QUESTION!

Is there a Massachusetts decision to

that effect?
MRo HAGOPIANs
QUESTION!

It*s in your brief?

MR„ HAGOPIAMs
QUESTION:

Yes, there is»

No, it is not in ay brief»

Could you give us the citation?

MR» HAGGPXANs

Vas.

It's Boyd and Whit-marsh v&a

the Registrar of Motor Vehicless and I don't have the
citation, but I will say that I raised the same issue in the
?

federal district court in a case called Omeda vs„ Massachu­
setts , end this Court affirmed that decision»

1 must confess, in that —
QUESTION r
cited in Cos tare Hi?

Is that the Whitmarsh case that was

7
MR» HAGOPIAHj
QUESTIONS

Yas# it Is, Your Honor»

No»

MR, HAGOPIAN%

No# wait a minute# I take that back?

there were two Whifcmarsh decisions»

The first Whitmarsh

decision# which was cited in the Cos tare111 brief is the one
on til® trial da novo issue itself»
QUESTION?

No# X*m referring to the Whitmarsh

decision as cited in our opinion»
MR» HAG-OP IAN s
QUESTIONS

Yes»

It —

I’ve got it# 31S N»E» 2d 610»

MR» HAGOPIAN:

Mo# there was another Whitmarsh

decision# Your Honor# that was against the Registrar of
Motor Vehicles,

That Whitmarsh decision# which was cited by

this Court in Cos tares 1.11 # involved an aspect of just the
criminal aspects of it»

We had a separate case going on

against the Registrar, see,
QUESTION?

You don't have the citation of the

other one?
MR» HAGOPIANs

I don’t# Your Honor# but we’ll

furnish that subsequently»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Just supply it to the

clerk»
QUESTION:

Did fee Supreme Court of Massachusetts

say tiiat a man’s driving license can b© taken for a conviction
that has been completely nullified?

3
MRo HAGQPIANs

Yes, absolutely and unequivocally»

.and what's worse is the statute says that one® he is — if
he's acquitted in the second -~
QUESTION %

I'm not talking about the statute , I'm

talking about what the Court said»
MRo HAGOPJANs

Yes, absolutely and unequivocally,

Your Honor»
There is no question and no doubt about that»
That is blade level law in Massachusetts, if there is s.uch a
thing ®
/aid the statute also provides that after he's
convicted, if he's acquitted in the second tier, the Registrar
gives him back his license as a matter of discretion? now, as
a matter of administrative procedure, it's automatic, the
minute he's acquitted in the second tier he gets his license
back»
So, you'see, what’s happened is they have imposed
a punishment on him for the price of a trial by jury*

And

that not only applies to license revocation, but also applies
to probation revocation? and that issue is now before the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court»
Well, what usually happens in these cases, when a
fallow is on probation, he gets — and he*s convicted of a
subsequent offense in the district court, and he alleges a
trial da novo, they yank his probation»

9
QUESTIONS

Of course# if Massachusetts wanted to

suspend “» if the Motor Vehicle Registrar wanted to suspend
his driver's license and not impose any criminal sanction#
they wouldn’t have to afford a jury trial for that# would
■they?
MRo HAGOPIAN:
Mr» Justice Rehnquisfc»

Wall# I'm not too sure about that#
There's one State court in -the

United States# in a case I5va cited in my brief# that holds
that they do»
You see# the reason is that it depends upon why
they yanked his license»

If it is because ha commits a

criminal offens® as defined by a statute in the State Code#
•then I’m not so sure that the burden roust b© beyond a
reasonable doubt»
Whether„ the jury trial issue gets in there is
another matter»
QUESTION:

Well# what if Massachusetts simply says

that not only is driving whiles drinking# or whatever your
client may have been charged with# a. criminal offense# hut
it is also a basis for revoking on© driver's license; and
if the Motor Vehicle Registrar thinks there's reason to
believe that has happened# he will hold a hearing the way
h@ holds other administrative hearings# without any jury#
and# t© suspend# he simply needs to find probable cans© that
it happened»

Anything wrong with that# constitutionally?

10

MR» HAGOFIANs

Well, I would say there would be

nothing wrong with that, at least if the hearing was to
determine his competency on the road»

There are State court

decisions which hold that where the revocation is purely as
a penalty for committing the criminal offense, whether that's
road related or not, then he's entitled to all the criminal
rights -dial; & criminal defendant has,
Now, there's one case I've cited in my brief, up
in the State of Alaska, and they have held squarely that he's
entitled to a trial by jury if you're going to yank a man's
licens® for a year»

Because teat period of time is such a

lengthy period of time, and teat's such a penalty, that he's
entitled to it»
And right in this District here, the District of
Columbia, vs» Colts, of course there was a fin® imposed and
7. think there was a maximum prison sentence of two montes.

But they talk about, in District, of Columbia vs» Colts, that
that is a penalty in the context that it's being revoked.
Now, I understand what you're saying, but there
are a number of similar cases»

1 think three or four years

ago th®r© was a case called One Lot Emerald Stones, white
involved this issue»

I think that was a forfeiture case»

Now, I suppose in these forfeiture proceedings they
can be civil in nature, and only the civil burdens ax'®
required of the government»

But where that imposed in Boyd,

11
in ih® Plymouth car case — and 1’ves cited those in my
brief — -there are cases in this Court that hold that you
must afford the accused criminal protection, or his criminal
rights in these types of situations»
On© of tiies© cases is One Lot Stones vs» United
States»

There’s a footnote in that — I believe Mr. Chief

Justice wrote that ©pinion.

And the other on© is On© _195_8

Plymouth Sedan vs. Pennsylvania, and 3oyd vs. United States.
Now, I’ve also cited on pages 50 and 51 the Alaska
decision of the Alaska Supreme Court on this particular

issue.
But getting back to the jurisdictional issue again,
let us take the single tier system.

If a man is convicted

in toe single tier system, at to® end of the trial he has the
option —* he may or the State may afford, him -» to grant him
a new trial.

He may make a motion for a new trial.

The minute he makes that motion for new trial and
it’s granted, he doesn’t have any right to complain about
what’s happened before in the first trial.
And the d® novo procedure is in. the same sense.
The fellow has an option to elect a trial d© novo.

Let’s

assume — there are many jurisdictions, I think there are
.16 jurisdictions in th® United States where you can get a
jury trial in either th® first tier or th© second tier.
Now, at th© end of th© first tier# a fellow has that

12
option to get; another trial de novo by jury or by judge, he
doesn't have to exercise that option„

And to me if the

State doesn't grant, him the right of appellate review at that
stag® of the proceedings, he has a right to come to this
Court, in the United " States Supreme Court, either by appeal
or certiorari, or h® may go over to the federal district
court by habeas corpus, or, if a fine is .imposed, he may
go over, perhaps, under the Civil Rights Act,
I have a case where a fellow did not want to go
to the second ferial»
QUESTIONS

well,

didn't Cosfear®Hi last year cast

some doubt on your proposition?
MR* HAGOPIANs

Well, in ttefe case, CostareHi

exercised his right for trial in the second tier»

But I have

cases where a fellow in the Cambridge district court was
convicted and fined $65 for larceny.

Instead of going for

a trial, de novo, we walked over to tha federal district court,
under the Civil Rights Act, even though a fine was only
imposed, and seeking a collateral attack on teat first tier
conviction.
I think ha's entitled to federal review of teat
conviction, without going through the second ferial»

In a

sense, that's the whole basis of the merits of this case.
That an accused doesn't have iao go through teo trials*
has a right

He

ha should have the right to have a ferial that

13

comports with -tiki® Constitution in the first instance»

And

he should have a right for appellate review in the federal
court# if the State does; not grant him appellate review at
that stag© of the proceedings»
QUESTION?

In your Massachusetts system# is ha able

to stand aside at the first -tier?

As was the case in

Kentucky# in Colten v* Kentucky?
MR. HAGOPIANs
QUESTION?

No# h© can8to

What does he dc?

MR* HAGGPIAMs

The most he can do is just sit with

his counsel# the government will put on their witnesses;
he can — there is an informal procedure, that's not
statutory# what's known as submitting to informal admissions
of facts*

Which means that you're not really going to

contest the trial# you'll allow hearsay to go on*

The

government still puts its parade cf witnesses on*

But it's

■a means of speeding up the first tier trial.
still convicted if found guilty*

But h®*s

But there's no way of by­

passing that at nil. y/
QUESTIONs

So he finds out what the government's

«as© is- just by keeping quiet# if ha wants to?

Can’t he

waive appearance at all# and —
MR* HAGOPIAM? Well# that has a certain amount of
danger- Mr» Justice Blackmun, because that testimony — and
that's what happened in Whitmarsh# the dhi@f witness# the

14
police officer, against Whitaarsh died subsequent to the
first trial»

And then when the second trial caste up, they

wanted to try Whitraarsh again and introduce his testimony,
the police chief officer's testimony from the first trial»
And if you don't attack his credibility when you're

cross-

examining him in the first trial, that evidence can be used
against you in the second trial»

So that there's a certain

amount of risk —
QUESTIONs
hearing, too,

Well, that’s true of a preliminary

Your preliminary hearing doesn't give you a

jury»
HR» HAGOPIAN:

Yes, I know that, Mr» Justice

Rehnquist»
QUESTION s

What was the fin® imposed at the first

trial here?
MR# HAGOPXANs
QUESTION:

Twenty dollars, Your Honor»

Mo prison --

MR* HAGOPXAN s

Mo, no prison sentence involved

in the case»
Fundamentally, on the merits of the case, Mr»
Chief Justice, or the issue of s right to trial by jury, I
think that the issue is a very simple issue»

It is that

there is no reason at all to justify why Massachusetts has
the right to take this

man's right to trial by jury away

from him than there is his right to cross-examine witnesses,

15

his right not, to self-incriminate himself, his right to
counsel»

1 mean, why can't Massachusetts take those rights

away from him and say, hey, we'll give him a second trial
d@ novo, and we'll cura all these defects?
I mean* that argument was in Ward vsc Village of
Monroevi11®, or the Mayor of Monroeville? and I just —
I don’t: — I can’t distinguish why the right for trial by
jury should be any different than any other fundamental
right.
It's true we have a six-month demarcation line, but
that coires out of historical origin, but there’s no historical
origin to justify the trial tie novo system in England at
the time feat this country was founded, fear® was trial de
novo, bend; trials? and you'll find feat in fee Colonies,
in Massachusetts ? but th©r® are extremely few Colonies or
States that, ever had a trial de novo system of jury trial
system as opposed to bench ferial system at. the time the
Constitution was framed,
That basically is the fundamental issue in the
case, Your Honor, and I submit that —
QUESTION: Well, it really boils down to fee question
of whether fee rule of Duncan v„ Louiaiama embraces the
doctrine of Callan vv^isoEa
MR. HAGOPIhNs

Well, I think that's true, but I

wouldn’t rr.st entirely on feat, iiz0 Justice Stewart.

16
Let's assume that Callan vs, Wilson never carae about to b@«
T-yaartF-n-i x m.■.
■■.r---

I think ites ~~
QUESTIONt

Well» you certainly — I hope you're

not going to throw that case aside»
MR» HAGQPXANs

Oh» no» certainly» Your Honor» I

agree with — I agree that that case was decided in this
Court here»
QUESTION?

That's far and away your best support

on the merits» isn't it?
MR» HAGGPIANs
Basically»

Yqs, itis» Your Honor»

But the underlying basis of that case is

that the defendant in that case was deprived of due process,
And that's what basically the arguments, the bedrock of
Call an is» that he — in fact» Mr, Justice Harlan.» in his
words» said that the defendant should not have to suffer the
burdens of two trials»

And that that is the bedrock of

Callan»
would also like to say» I'm not saying we should
do away with trial d@ novo; all I want is the accused to
have that right to have the option for jury trial in the
first instance» And that isn’t going to affect Massachusetts.
I don't believe that the compelling interest doctrine should
apply to this case, but even if you do apply it to this case»
Massachusetts can easily gives the defendant the option»
There are very few defendants that are going to exercise -that

1?
option®
There ar® certain instances where that option will
always be exercised, but in those type of cases the fellow
is almost inevitably going to take the .right for a trial de
novo anyway,,
There are cases, if you do give them the option,
there will be a slight increase, perhaps very infinitesimal,
in the number of jury trials, but it's only going to be in
those cases where the fellow has been deterred originally by
-the fie novo system®

And I don't think that the Commonwealth

has any right, to complain about that end result.®
So, in effect, what I'm simply asking here is that
the accused have the option to go to the jury first, and 1
don't understand why Massachusetts should complain about
that issue®
I*d like to reserve the rest of my time®
QUESTIONs

Could I ask you a question?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes®

Suppose a man goes into trial at the

first tier unrepresented by counsel»
MR® HAGOPIANs

Yes®

QUESTIONs And he's convicted®

Is he advised as a

routine matter in your Massachusetts system that ha has a
right to appeal it?
MR. H&GOPIAN:

Yes*

He doesn't — they don't

18

advise him he has a right "to a jury trial, they says

You

have a right of appeal»
And all these convictions where a fellow doesn't
exercise his appeal# if you look at the record# oa the
face of the record# nowhere haste waived his right for a
trial by jury»
He has failed to appeal# whatever -that term may
moan»

But there's nothing on the face of the record to show

that h@'s waived his right to trial by jury»

And I have

cases in the federal district court whore prisoners have
been released from the Massachusetts first-tier system
simply because there is nothing — even if you sustain or
agree with the de novo concept — there is nothing on the
face of the record to show that he has waived his right for
trial by jury»
QUESTIONS
the Call an case»

One other question»

You mantiosisd

Is on© reason that you're not r@st.ing on.

it entirely the fact that it was an Article IV case?
MRo HAGOPIAKs

Well# yes# Your Honor.

But the

principle underneath Callan is very simple# it's a depriva­
tion of due process# it's a burden.

The defendant — why

should ho have to go through two trials?

Not only to get

what i.e’s entitled to in the first instance.

Likewise, why

should he hav© hr go through two trials before h© has the
right to federal review?

The jurisdictional issue is —

19
QUESTIONS Well? what you3rs saying is that you’re
relying on the Fourteenth Amendment? •—
MR. HAGO?IAN;
QUESTION s

Yes» Your Honoro

—- whereas in Callan they relied on

Article IV0
MRo HAGOPIAN;
QUESTIONS

Yes »

Well? Callan? I notice? does mention

those Massachusetts early easies —
MRo HAGOPIAN;
QUESTIONS

Yes? it does.

— do you think the Court's opinion

really expressly disapproved them? or just kind of puts
them to one side?
MR, HAGOPIAN;

Well? Justice Harlan in that case

said he wouldn’t follow it*

He didn't say why he wouldn’t

follow it? he disapproved of it*

But. the decision is not all

that clear as to what hia reasoning is*
But you get into this problem of what is required
•in the federal, system as opposed to what is required in the
States•

And I think — you know? Harlan didn’t obviously

adderess himself to that issue»
QUESTION;

He didn’t have to»

MR. HAGOPIANs

No? that’s right? he didn’t have to.

And? of course? that*s th© problem.
But? underneath *— the bedrock of that case is very
simples? and Harlan expressed it.

Th® man shouldn’t have to

20

go through twice what h®!s entitled to in the first instance»
And -that's the bedrock of that decision»

It seems to in® that

sounds under the Fourteenth Amendment* in due process»
QUESTIONS

Of course* Article IV says that he's

antitied to a jury trial»
MR. HAGOPIANs

Yes* Your Honor, and of course that

— he's interpreting that -bo — as to what that meant»
And I suppose in the Sixth Amendment

and he * in a sense *»~

Callan also interprets what was in the Sixth Amendment* too»
The words in the Massachusetts Constitution are almost
identical or equivalent* that's what Chief Justice Shaw said
in the Massachusetts case* he said it’s the same tiling as
interpreting the Sixth Amendment»
Bi.it Chief Justice Shaw also does not show any
historical basis for sustaining his decision»
And I don't believe that there is historical basis
to sustain the d© novo procedure.
QUESTION;

What is your —~ what precisely »*» what

is fchts constitutional provision you're relying on?
MR. HAGOPIAN s

I rely on the Fourteenth Amendment*

Your Honor»
QUESTION s

But are you relying on the right to

jury trial as. incorporated?
MR. HAGOPIJOi:
QUESTIONj

Yes, Your Honor»

And nothing else?

21

MR e, HAGOPIANs Arci also fundamentally due process „
I think the fundamental issue of due process»
QUESTIONS

Wellt which is it?

MR» HAG-OP X Ml s
QUESTIONS

Both, of them?

Yes , Your Honor, both of thesu

And also, at least in your brief, a

double jeopardy claim?
MRo HAGOPIANs

Yes, there is the double jeopardy

issue, and the double jeopardy issue, Your Honor, is a very
simple issue»

It is that you can't fore© the man to go 'through

two trials, to jump the hoop twice»

That's exactly what

double jeopardy is0
When the

the double jeopardy provision limits

the government to a single proceeding, that means a single
proceeding that comports with constitutional standards»

I

don't see how that the double jeopardy clause can be re ad
any other way»

I mean that’s the whole underlying basis of

the double jeopardy clause»
QUESTION t

I suppose Colten v, Kentucky is against

you on that one, isn't it?
MR» HAGOPIANs

No, it isn't, Your Honor, because

in CoS.tgnjvsu._K©ntucky the men had a -ight to a jury trial
in the first instance in Colten? he waived that right in

Colton»
I also have a summary of th.es de novo procedures in
30 jurisdictions, that was prepared, not by myself, but if

22
the Court would like this? just briefly, there are 30
jurisdictions, 16 of them allow a jury trial in the first
tier or the second tier? on® jurisdiction allows a jury trial
in either one tier or fas other, you take your pick? and
the 13 remaining jurisdictions, in those you cannot get a
jury trial in 7 of them in the first instance, in 6 of them
you have a right to bypass the first tier trial and go
directly to a jury trial in the second tier trial®
If the Court would like, 1cd be glad to submit
all the statutes in the 30 jurisdictions®
QUESTION;

Hava those been published anywhere?

MR® HAGOPIAN;

They are not. Your Honor®

There is something by the National State Courts,
but it’s nowhere near as comprehensive as tills®
I submit it for your information purposes®
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Will you lodge that

with th© Clerk, and give it to your friend?
MR. HAGOPIAN;

He has a copy of it? I supplied it®

QUESTION; Now, when you went to the second tier,
you did not want a jury, is that correct?
MR* HAGOPIAN;
1 didn't want it®

That's correct, Your Honor®

X didn't want to moot up the issue*

And

I thought that if we — after a jury trial, that if he was
convicted, there would ha nothing to complain about®

And

if hs was found innocent, that would have been the end of th®

23
matter,,
That was just a decision based on the law at the
time o

The government never raised ■■■•■
QUESTION s

Are you suggesting you were afraid you

might win in the second tier?
MR« HAGOPIAN:

No„

[Laugh ter o ]

It sounded like it*

QUESTIONS

You roe an before a jury?

Yes„

MRo HAGOPIANs

Well# I don't know# Your Honor «*■»

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR* IRWIN:

Mr* Chief Justice# and may it pleas©

the Courts
On behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts# I
think that in a preliminary way I would like to outline the

24

— probably in an overview fashion ~ the course I hop® bo
pursue in ray argument.
I would first touch on a jurisdictional situation
that I think is appropriate to bring before this Court»

I

then would proceed to a discussion of what? at least in the
court
judgment of the Commonwealth, the Massachusetts/said in the
Ludwig decision»

I would then try to impress upon the Court

what we conceive to ba the notion of de novo procedure in
Massachusetts, and what it's all about»
Thereafter, try to evaluate ‘that particular procedure
in the light of what this Court said in Duncan v» Louisiana»
Stating at least minimally that our position is that Duncan ve
Louisiana stated a right to trial by jury rather than a mod©»
Then trying to establish to the Court what fee mod®
of delivery of that right is in Massachusetts.
And whether or not it fulfills the basic concept ~oonstltutional concept of jury trial, as has been enunciated
by this Court»
And finally, hopefully to discuss the double
jeopardy considerations»
Proceeding on that outline, I would like, first of
all, in a jurisdictional way to ask this Court to considar that
the record before it constitutes a petition for certiorari,
rathar them an appeal*
The Commonwealth does that, fully knowing that we

25
have not; briefed it»

But in preparing for this particular

argument# I was referenced to the decision of this Court in
Costarffilli* where this subject matter was raised by a footnote#
and also in reviewing the brief of the Commonwealth in the
Co3tar@.lli case# it was footnoted there»
I think it is significant# and I would suggest to
the Court feat it regard this procedure or this review as
certiorari rather than appeal for the following reasons s
Section 2# which is used by fch© Appellant to
invoke the jurisdiction of this Court# I think quite clearly
suggests that a statuta has to have been put in issue before
the State court# allegedly repugnant to the Constitution#
which statute was decided in favor of the Commonwealth or
in favor of the State at the highest court possible for -to,®
defendant or for the appellant to have a judgment,,
I regard that as being construed# or that word
“statute” being construed literally,

I would respectfully

suggest to the Court that vrhat is in issue here really is an
'assertion of a right that is} X suppose# comprised out of a
procedure in Massachusetts that has evolved# at least
arguably# over a period of two centuries at least# and
probably three centuries c
In that extent -- to that, extent* what he is doing
is asserting a right under Section 3- and therefore* if the
Court agrees that certiorari is the appropriate way in which

26
this Court has ravisw, I would further suggest to the Court
that it has broad jurisdiction or discretional jurisdiction in
whether or not it would in fact grant that particular writ.
And having in mind the scope of the relief that the
appellant seeks here* it would seem ‘to ra® appropriate that 'this
Court have before it a much broader detailed record, dealing
with the issues that he claims deprives him of a constitu­
tional right of jury trial, and, absent that, -the Court would
deny his application for writ of certiorari.
QUESTION: And you say the reason this isn’t
properly an appeal is because the challenge is not to the
Massachusetts statute, but to the custom and practice
following in the Massachusetts court system?
MR. IRWIN: Yes, it is — that is primarily the
reason that I assert, Mr. Justice Relinquish.

I would

suggest that there is no statute in Massachusetts that says
specifically that in a first tier situation a defendant has
no right to • trial by jury.

I think that has developed

historically *
QUESTION:

But it is ~~ it's well-settled

Massachusetts law, as a matter of judicial construction of
the statute, is it not?
MR. SEWIN':

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Stewart.

QUESTION: Well, then, that's what th® statute means,
because that's what the Massachusetts courts have said that it

27

means,. Wouldn't that follow?
MR. IRWINs

I would suggest it does followa

I think what I'm suggesting is that he is, under
Section 3, asserting more of a right rather than a statutory
situation, and that therefore the Court, I suppose just in
■terms of oddly appellate procedures, should construe that
statute vary literally»
QUESTIONz

Of course, it°s not up to us to construe

the statute? that's been done for us by the Massachusetts
court, rad which has made it very clear that there is no
right to a jury trial at the first tier,
MRo IRWIN:

QUESTION:

That's righto
But your position is the reason that

they’ve made it clear is not because of any provision of the
statute, but because of their own ruling as to the right of
jury trial in Massachusetts trial courts?
MRo IRWINs

That's exactly right# Mr. Justice

Rehnquiet.
Proceeding along to analysis of what the Massachusetts
court did in the Ludwig case, which is the case before this
Court# I think it's safe to say, or fair to say that the
court simply reaffirmed its judgment in the case of Cotmonwealth vs, Whitmarsh; and I think that probably a succinct
analysis of that decisioni would be that the Massachusetts
court said that its d© novo trial procedure, as outlined here

28

before this Court* at least partially outlined here

before

•this Court* is in fact a constitutionally permissible mod® of
jury trial* in the light of the Duncan v, Louisiana case»
1 think the Massachusetts court arguably went on© a tap further
and said that it regarded Duncan vt Louisiana not as setting
forfeit an absolute right to trial by jury with all of the
appendages* if you want to put it that way* of the federal
system* but as establishing a right rather than a mode*
And that in order for -os to determine here today
whether or not the mode that Massachusetts applies is
constitutionally valid* it seems to me that we have to examine*
to a great extent*, the mechanics or the definition* if you
want, of the Massachusetts de novo procedure*
Very briefly* there are four levels of courts in
Massachusetts which deal with criminal cases.

There ara

the district courts* they are 73 in number* they are geo­
graphically located throughout the Commonwealth of Massachu­
setts.

They are* in their composition * I suppos©* rural*

urban and suburban*
sessions*

Some of them have several criminal

That 73 includes also the Boston Municipal Court.
Its jurisdiction in criminal cases is covered by

Chapter 210 Section 4 of the Massachusetts General Laws*
which covers really all misdemeanors and certain felonies
punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.

Although I

think it should h@ noted that district court judges at that

29
first tier level, if they take jurisdiction, in terras of a
felony involving possible punishment up to five years5
imprisonment, the district court judge cannot sentence to
•the Massachusetts State Prison, he can only sentence to the
House of Correctionso
And obviously there are no juries at that particular
level®
The Superior Court is 'the court which I suppose is
most adequately d@scri.bed as our great trial court, it has
original jurisdiction in all criminal cases»

It. serves as an

appeal court for the cases coming out of the district court»
There is somewhat of an interposition, approximately eleven
years ago, of a six-man jury trial where, on appeal from the
district: court, what you can in effect do is waive your 12-man
jury trial in the Superior Court and opt for a six-man jury
trial» So probably the six-man jury is batter described as
being in,for the purposes of our discussion, the appeal
level or the Superior Court type of level»
QUESTION;

Is there a Superior Court in every county

in Mass adiusetts?
MR® IRWIN:

Yes, there is, Mr» Justice Stewart»

We have 14 counties in Massachusetts, and we have Superior
Court that covers all those counties»
QUESTION:

Some of them being multi-judge, of

course, and some being maybe a single judge?

30

MRo IRWIN:

That's righto

w© have 46 justices on the court* in the Superior
CourtThey sit on circuit* usually month-fco-month* different,
assignments in different counties,
Beyond that* in terms of getting appellate review
of cases that are tried in those two tiers* we have just
recently* three years ago* enacted legislation which gives
us an intermediate appellat»® court* which* in the first
instance* I suppose* reviews all criminal cases except for
some very specific exceptions; those would be first-degree
murder cases* cases in which the punishment being imposed in
tli© trial was life or death — I mean life imprisonment or
death; and a situation* ironically* where you can get a
direct appeal from a six-man jury verdict -to 'the Supreme
Judicial Court,,
Our Supreme Judicial Court* of course* is the
court of last resort* and that is the court that decided the
issue in Ludwig here® before us,
I think the next tiling that we should consider
is that in the context of that particular structure of
judicial dealing with criminal cases* what happens at the
first tier.

And I think that Mr, Justice Blaekmun raised a

very pertinent point* when h© asked* I think in connection
— probably having in mind Coltan v, Kentucky —• whether
or not a defendant in a Massachusetts trial court* the first

31
•tier court, has the ability to evade or to otherwise move
away from that particular procedure in some sort of waiver
posture»
I would suggest to feh© Court that there is a
procedure, and it was alluded to somewhat by counsel for the
appellant»

There is a procedure known as admitting sufficient

findings of facts

Wherein feh© district court -- and this is

not a statutory procedure, but an accepted procedure that has
evolved over the years in the court — where the district
court justice will hear just sufficiently enough evidence to
1 suppose to warrant him in concluding that thera is probable
causes for the existence of the complaint»

Because that’s how

we begin in the first tier system, by complaint»
Once having satisfied himself of that, he then can
go ahead and enter a finding of guilty and, as a matter of
fact, impose a sentence on that, from which — at least in
the contention of the Commonwealththat parson who has
just mad® that admission has an immediate right to wipe
the slate clean one© and forever»
QUESTION; So, functionally, that’s not unlike just
a binding-over proceeding, is that what you —
MR® IRWIN:

That’s right, Mr» Justice Stewart»

QUESTION s And is that practice availed of when it’s
clear that the defendant is going to ask to go to the
Superior Court?

And only then?

32
MR. IRWINt

Ycsse it is.

It's don© only then,

as a matter of fact, it.£s almost in the category of waiver,
I would say, because what counsel dees ordinarily is go to
the trial justice in the court and indicate that he really
sees nothing to contest here, that h© feels that he would be
better off in the Superior Court, and he would b© better
off moving there quickly.
QUESTIONs
tradition, isn't it?

So it's almost by agreement that
That ites evolved that this has been

converted into a °— just a traditional binding over for
trial?
MR. IRWINs
QUESTIONS
MR. IRWINs

That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Is that it?
Yes, it is.

QUESTIONS Except, of course, on his record is this
conviction that's new been set aside?
MR. IRWIN;
QUESTION;

That's right.
Which your brother told us might have

the — in a vehicle cases might have the collateral consequence
of the deprivation of the defendant's driving license "for a
period.
MR. IRWIN;
QUESTION;

It. might? yes, it might.
Is the motion to appeal made substanti:.!iy

3imulfean.eot.isly with the entry of the plea of guilty?
MR. IRWIN;

Yes, it is. Your Honor.

33

QUESTION? So all of this could fappan in a matter of
fifteen minutes, 15<3 think,
MR, IRWIN?

it. could happen in a matter of ten

minutes, if Your Honor please? and many times does,
QUESTION ?

Yes,

So you —- in effect, you stipulate

to probable cause facts, the judge enters a judgment of
conviction,

»

MR, IRWIN s
QUESTION?

Righto
— you say "I appeal”, and the judgment

is thereupon wiped out?
MR® IRWIN?

That's correct. Your Honor®

And his appeal is entered or — and I think, you
know, when we’re talking about appeal, my conviction is, or
the Commonwealth's conviction is that that is not very
well denominated®

I would prefer to call it an assertion of.

his inevitable right to trial by jury in Massachusetts0
And I think it's important for this Court, to understand that
in Massachusetts if a defendant wants, in any criminal case,
tiny criminal case, from the most minute parking violation to
first-degree murder, he can in fact get a jury trial of
twelveo
QUESTION? And he- doesn't even need to purport to
allege an error in the first trial in order to assert that?'
MR® IRWIN;
QUESTION;

Hs does not, Mr® Justice Stewart®
Are timers any costs imposed as a result

34
of the first trial?
MR© IRWIN;

There are not- Mr© Justice Stevens©

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the first trial?
MR© IRWIN:

IBra sorry# Your Honor?

QUESTION; What is the purpose -that®a served *»what interest does the Commonwealth have in having the first
trial?
MR© IRWINs
has this interests

I would suggest that the Commonwealth
that there is before the Court and in

■the record her® and in the briefs an indication that the
Massachusetts district court system as we know it handles
approximately one million criminal matters a year©

That

d© novo approach allows the district court# in our judgment#
to weed out those cases that appropriately should not go
on to the Superior Court# where a proper exercise of judicial
judgment will terminate the case by way of a not guilty in
the first instance©
QUESTION;

Or by way of a guilty and a minor

punishment that ~~
MR. IRWIN;

Exactly©

That would be acceptable to

the defendant.
QUESTION:

If there's justice in the case then

thees9s no reason to appeal# is that it?
MR. IRWIN; Exactly©
^^'OUESTIOM;

iffill# why not# when the man is going to

35
appeal, why just s&y, Well,, sine© you0res going to appeal and
you're going to get a jury trial, you don't have to go through
this other one®

What good is the first hearing to the

State, where you know the man is going to appeal and ask for
a jury trial?
What benefit does the State have for the first tier?
MR» IRWINg Well, in the situation that you gave ,
Mr» Justice Marshall, I would say the State really has no
benefit if what you're suggesting is, the situation that I
think you are, that where they know ha's going to appeal0^QUESTIONj

No, Mr. Attorney General, I'm suggesting

the situation you saido

You said that where the man goes

in and tells the judges

Look, I'm going for an appeal, and

I'm going because I want & jury trial»
Now, why doesn't he just go and get the jury trial?
Why does the State say;

Whoop!

Before you do that, you've

got to go through this charade»
MR. IRWINs Well, in the situation that you just
posited, Mre Justice Marshall, the court, the district court
in question, given the situation that you just posited,
in ray judgment, would do nothing more than satisfy itself
that there is probable cause to the existence of that complaint,,
enter a finding of guilty, and say;
appeal«,
QUESTION 5

Why?

Leave and go have your

36
MR» IRWINs

Because it's the expeditious way to

handle the matter, in my judgments
QUESTION8 Well, the expeditious way is just to
transfer it to the other courts
MRo IRWINi Well, that's, in effect, what they're

doings
QUESTION?

The Massachusetts Legislature has said

you do it by tills particular mechanism, and therefor® the
judge has no option, does he?

MRo IRWINs

That's right, the judge has no optiona

QUESTION?

Then he may or may not. accept a plea

MRo IRWINs

He may accept a plea of guilty in the —

of guilty?

QUESTIONs Without any evidence?
MR0 IRWIN: Well, no, I don't — I think what he
would do, Mr» Justice White, if a plea of guilty was entered
in the district court, where he had final jurisdiction *—
QUESTION:

Well, may he appeal from a plea of

MR® IRWIN?

Yes, he can? but the only thing that's

guilty?

open to him on an appeal from a plea of guilty is the
disposition of the case, the sentencing»
QUESTION?

So that he may not have a jury trial

if he pleads guilty?
MR» IRWIN?

He may not

37

QUESTIONS

Thase hypotheticals we'va been putting

to you about, his standing aside in order to get & jury trial*
do not fit this case* do they* because he did not want a
jury trial in the second tier?
MRo IRWINs
■feliat jury trial0

That's right* he apparently waived

And again I suppose that’s why the option

is open to him* what he could do even if h© gets to the
Superior Court* where he might be claiming a 12-man jury* he
is ©mpowared under our Massachusetts setup to go ahead and
waive his jury trial the;re<,
QUESTION; But you said normally -Hi® purpose in
most cases of bypassing ac standing routs at the first trial*
first tier trial* is in order to get a jury*
MRU IRWINs

Exactlyp

QUESTION? But that was not the objective in -this
oas®?

MRo IRWINs
QUESTIONs

Apparently it was notc
Mr* Irwin* your sister State of Rhode

Island* I think * has a very similar* if not almost identical
statutory system* which* as I understand it* has been declared
to be invalid* was declared invalid by a district court in
Rhode Island end has now moved to adopt by a district court8s
decree? am I mistaken in this?
MRo IRWINs
Honor please

No* 1 think you9r« correct* if Your

38
QUESTION s

And how does Rhode Island g© about, it

am?
MR» IRWINs

16m nofc sure, if Your Honor please, ho»

Rhode Island goes about it, except that apparently — my
understanding is that what they do now is offer a jury trial
in the first instance, at 'feat first — at the district court
level.? allow the defendant to assert his right to a jury
trial and set it out for a jury trial»
I think what you have in mind is probably ih©
consequences of the Halliday case»
QUESTIONS
MR. IRWIN s

Halliday? feat's the case»
Y©S.

QUESTION:

Yes»

QUESTION s

Could Mar s ach us s hts do this without an

amendment to your statute?
MR. IRWIN:

I would say Massachusetts, I suppose,

could advance a court rule, by rule of court, or probably by
a legislative change, do exactly that, if Your Honor please»
What I would suggest to the Court, though, is that
constitutionally I don't think that's necessary.
QUESTION: But, in answer to the Chief Justice's
question, you said at the very outset feat fee statute
itself doesn't explicitly deny a jury trial?
MR® IRWINs

It does not.

QUESTION: At the first tier

39

MR. IRWINs
QUESTIONS

It does not.
So, presumably,, the answer to the Chief

Justice's question is yesiT Massachusetts could do this without
an amendment to the statute?
MRo IRWIN:

I would say yes.

I would say yes,? Mr.

Justice Stewart»
QUESTION2 But yen couldn't just sort of refer the
case to the second -tier?
MR © IRWIN s*

I dcmBt think you could do that, no,

I do not, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTIONs

Or you couldn't just permit an appeal

from a guilty pies?
MR. IRWINs

No, you could not.

No, you could not®

QUESTION:

Bo you happen to know, is the Ball!day

case cited in the brief — I thought it was, but I don't
seem to find it.
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor please.
Maybe Halilday isn't the front name,
I think it’s the footnote.

QUESTION: What court was that, federal or State?
MR. IRWIN:

The Rhode Island Supreme Court, if

Your Honor please.
QUESTION:

As a matter of Federal Constitution or

the State?
MR. IRWIN:

I think they decided it as a matter of

40

Stata constitutional law®
QUESTIONS

Well0 that's —- h@re it is# State v0

Hal 11 day# 109 Rhode Island 93? is that it?
MR® IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR® IRWINs

Yes # it is# if Your Honor pleas©®
Thank you®
Your Honor# moving along in the

argument# the Commonwealth's position is that when this Court
enunciated Duncan v® Louisiana# what it did really was
establish a right to trial by jury# but did not establish a
mode to constitutional jury trial®

And therefore it is open

to Massachusetts# and other d® novo States# to examine
whether or not the d© novo procedures that they have in
effect deliver constitutionally mandated jury trial in a
constitutional mode®
And I would respectfully suggest to the Court that
on the intense analysis that this Court has mad© of its
procedure# and in weighing it against the perspectives that
were set out in analysing the jury ferial right in Duncan v®
Louisiana# we can find that; the Massachusetts system is
basic and fundamental# first by way of historical analysis#
second by way of contemporary practices among other States #
and thirdly# to the extent that it fulfills the stated
function and purpose of the jury ferial in America; to wit#
1 suppose# to stand as a bastion against oppression# and to
allow a person accused of crime to have the judgment of his

41
peers in any given criminal case that is presented against
himc
It seems to me that by that analysis and by a fair
and objective appraisal of the Massachusetts system, we can
find that the Massachusetts system does serve to prevent:
on®, unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies?
two, judges who are too responsive to the voice of higher
authority? three, protection against arbitrary action? four*,,
the Massachusetts system does prevent the corrupt and over”»
zealous prosecutor? five, it does prevent the situation where
you have a compliant or a biased or eccentric judge? six, it
does serve to present the exercise of plenary powers over
the life and’ liberty of its citizens by one judge or a
group of judges? and seven, it does prevent unchecked power
and it does prevent arbitrary law enforcement»
It seems to me that going back and analysing
Duncan v, Louisiana, this Court tried to determino what
a constitutional jury trial was in terms of its history and
in terms of its contemporary use, I suppos©, in our society»
But it seemed to me that thereafter, that when this
Court decided cases such as hpodaca and such as Williams v»
Florida •*•«* Apodaca v» Oregon —■ that what it did really was
to lean more toward an evaluation of whether or not this
particular jury

system that is put in question served those

basic purposes that I just outlined»

42
And if the answer to that is in the affirmative,
then the system that is challenged in the given State stands
the test, of constitutionally fair jury trial0
Finally, the Commonwealth would direct itself for
a few moments to the issue of double jeopardy«,
QUESTIONS

What do you do about Callan vc Wilson?

Or have you told us?
MRo IRWIN:

Well, again, I think that my position

in Cal lan vt, Wilson, or the Call an v„ Wilson case is this,
if Your Honor pleases
Duncan y„ Louisiana, in interpreting Cal lan v„
Wilson, as it, I suppose, was imposed upon the States, in
effect said that where you would be entitled to a jury trial
in the federal system for a particular offense, that is
beyond petit, you are entitled to a jury trial in the given
State0
My understanding of the Louisiana"™ Duncan v0
Louisiana case was that there was a statute which provided
for no jury trial and yet allowed a punishment up to two
years' imprisonment„
The Calleai case apparently involved imprisonment
potential over six months, six. months or over? and the Court,
I think, simply said, in Duncan _y* Louisiana, in interpreting
Callan v»^ wiIson, that where a State seeks to impose punish™
neat over six months, inasmuch as you would be entitled to a

43
jury trial in fch© federal court, if that were the case, you
are entitled to a jury trial in the State*
So, I guess what I'm saying is — I know what I'm
saying is that if there's a State now that is in a position
where it can sentence somebody to mors than six months”
imprisonment, this Court would say, in terms of Duncan v*
.Louisiana and Callcm_ vt,_ Wilson, that that State has to provida
a jury trial*
I

don't suggest to the Court that in Dun cars v0

Louisiaria this Court ever enunciated what mode of jury trial
that had to take0

As a matter of fact, I think the Court

had gone on later on, in Apodaca and in Williams to indicate
that certain guarantees in terms of federal jury trials
certainly ar© not binding on the States *
QUESTIONs

That's consistant with Mr* Justice

Portas*e concurring opinion in Duncan0
MR* IRWINs

Exactly*

In which he said?

we can

have the- hide, but we don't have to —QUESTION?

Have the tail along with it*

Nov?, what was tie maximum sentence impossible under
the offense for which the appellant was tried?
MR* IRWINs Two years, two years in th© House of
Correction, and a fins up to $200*
QUESTION s

Yes*

And on® more question, while I have you interrupted*

44
I8xn correct, am X, in my understanding that on this trial
de noTOf first of all, will the jury know or will it not know
about the first ferial and the first judgment?
MR® IRWIN; The jury will not know about it®
QUESTIONt

If there's a waiver of a jury, with the

judge know?
MR® IRWINs

If there is a waiver at the district

court —•
QUESTION?

As in this case there was®

MR® IRWIN; The judge would know, yes, he would®
QUESTIONs And if the jury would not; know about the
judgment, he would presumably also certainly not know about
any sentence imposed?
MR® IRWINs

That's right®

QUESTION; But at the new trial there would be a
complete and uninhibited freedom for the court to impose
any sentence within the statutory limits, regardless of
the sentence that had been imposed at the district court
level?
MR® IRWIN:

Exactlyp if Your Honor please®

QUESTION; Thank you®
QUESTIONs

Is it the practice sometimes to impose

a heavier sentence than was initially imposed?
MR® IRWIN;
QUESTION;

Yes, it is®
It. happens

It.ss not uncommon®

45
MR® IRWIN s

And

yet it's not uncommon that they

impose the sarce sentence at maybe even a lighter sentence»
I would say that it varies almost on a 5Q-5Q basis®
QUESTIONS

It's a true trial d© novo in that sense»

MRa IRWIN:

Yes, it is, if Your Honor pleas©»

For just the final few moments left to m© in -this
argument, Ied like to address the question of double
jeopardy»
It seams to me that Col ten v» Kentucky is dispositive:
of that contention here by the appellant»
I suggest that for several reasons, and one is
that ray recollection of the Colten v» Kentucky case, directing
itself to the question of double jeopardy, contrasted the
?
?
Pear-son v» North Carolina case, or distinguished the Pearson
v» North Carolina case, and pointed to the question of
vindictiveness, and I think, to a certain extent, that's just
been touched upon here»
It doesn't appear that, for example, in terms of,
I suppose exerting your right to appeal on trial de novo,
that you are in any jeopardy of vindictiveness, because
what you ere doing is you are going from a differant court,
system to a different — to a Superior Court, where the
people who will adjudicat® your claim are in no way connected
with the first court»
Secondly, I think the Court's position that if in

46

fact f in Colten v, Kentucky, you have a true de novo type
of system, where -anere is in effect a wiping clean of the
slats, then, obviously, all of those things that are
inherent in double jeopardy, such as -the hazards of trial,
the necessity of utilizing your legal tools, I suppose, at
that given hearing, all of those type of tilings are non­
existent in that so-called do novo procedure, and therefore
not vulnerable to a claim of double jeopardy as I s@© ito
And I would respectfully suggest to the Court that
it would be totally consistent with the finding in Colten v®
Kenfcucky to find that the Massachusetts da novo system
exactly does wipe the slate clean and therefore presents no
double jeopardy problem to this particular Court®
QUESTION

Mr® Irwin, are there ever any jury

trials in this court?
MR® IRWINs

I'm sorry?

QUESTIONs

Are there jury trials of any kind

in your district court?
MR® IRWINs

There are not.

QUESTION:

Not®

MR® IRWINs

There are -the situations whore we have

tii© six-man jury trials in district courts, but they are on
appeal from that district court, as I tried to outline in
my — and X think they are probably more properly considered
by this Court to fo© at tin® Superior Court level®

thank the Court for its attention»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr» Hagopian?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W, HAGOPIAN* ESQ» *
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR» HAGOPIAN s

I would like to clear up one or

two points * Your Honor»
My first point is about this appeal and certiorari
jurisdiction.
The statute in Massachusetts* Chapter 218* Section
26* confers jurisdiction on the district courts»

District

courts have been construed by Massachusetts in Jones vsa
Robbins 'bo mean courts without jury»

Now, that statute is

squarely presented* among other statutes? so I think the case
is properly up here* Your Honor* on appeal»
No» 2* Your Honor* there are a lot of consequences
about this business in the first tier trials that my brother
hasn't mentioned* and the most important one is that once
■the sentence is imposed in the first tier* if the defendant
defaults in the second tier
when he's supposed to

supposing he doesn't show up

- that sentence of the district court

is imposed* and the man winds up going to jail* and it's
not pursuant to a judgment of his peers by the district court
sentence»
That's statutory in Massachusetts* and it goes on

all th© time if the
QUESTIONs What you're telling us there is common
to all defaults, or many defaults? you're saying that if he
defaults he's in trouble»
MR» HAGOPlANs

And that’s —■
Sure, he is, but you can’t convict a

man in ..absentia, and that’s what it is»

It’s a judgment

by default»
QUESTIONS

Oh, yes; quite the contrary»

Convictions can be had in

absentia, if the defendant

voluntarily absents hixusalf»
MR» HAGOPIANs I believe that issue was raised,
?
Your Honor, in. Tacuntjys» Arison?,
but I don’t think I can —
If he absents himself from trial»

But if the state never

gets him into court to begin with, I don't believe -that he
can be tried in absentia»

Now, I believe that —■* I don’t

think that issu® has been squarely presented by this Court»
But what’s happened her® is —
QUESTION: Well, you were speaking of his default,
his failure to show at; toe second tier trial.
MR. HAGOPlANt

That’s correct»

That’s correct, yes»
What happens is the first tier judgment is then
imposed.
QUESTION: Well, how else could you get him in court?
MR® HAGOPlAN:

I suppose you could arrest him,

49
Your Honor , which is *—
QUESTION: Welly I nssB, if you put a rule that if
the man doesn’t show in the second tier* he goes free —*
MR» HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Oh, I didn’t say that, Your Honor«
I think you'd have a little difficulty

getting him there, wouldn't you?
[Laugh ter » 3
MRe HAGOPIAN:

Yes, I do# Your Honor»

But-? you se®,

what's happened is it’s shifted the burden here to the
defendant»
And in the second tier, everybody knows, the juries
all know that these fellows have been convicted down in the
first tier»

The trials are segregated»

The district court

judges sit on them, not the Superior Court judges»

And it’s

quite obvious that they’ve been convicted»
QUESTION:

But in a single tier system, if you

fail to make a timely demand for jury trial, you waive it»
MR» HAGOPIAN:

Oh, I don’t -- in a criminal

proceeding, Your Honor?
QUESTIONs

Yes *

MR» HAGOPIAN:

I don't bffilieve there bs any —- it

can constitute any waiver of a specific fundamental procedural
right in a criminal trial, unless it's expressed*

In fact,

most, courts, most jurisdictions hold it must be written»
I don't believe that that’s true in the criminal proceedings»

50

In fact:, in Boykin, 'they hold that unless there's
something on the record, forget about whether he even did
waive it if it isn't established on the record* the
conviction has to be set aside, as I understand that case*
In any ©vent ~~
QUESTION?

Would the privilege to — would it

satisfy your argument if the defendant had the privilege of
pleading 'guilty and then appealing?
I don't like to see the fact that

MR® HAGOPIAN?

he has to plead guilty, Your Honor, I think that the
conviction itself burdens —•
QUESTION?

1 know you don't like it? but how about

it as a constitutional matter?
MR® HAGOPIANs

Well, that's a close issue, and

of course that's the case in «—
QUESTIONs

Well, what's your position on it?

MR® HAGOPIANs

Well, I'll have to concede to that

point. Your Honor, because you wrote the opinion in Colten,
and that's what you said®

So I guess that's established law*

[Laughter® ]
QUESTION? Well, in Colton, ~~
MR* HAGOPIAN?
QUESTION:

He has to plead guilty -**

—* you suggested in Colton that h® could

get a jury trial *»*"
MR* HAGOPIAN:

Yes, he can

—* in the first tier court?

MRo HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION;

That's correct0

I thought he could just plead guilty»

MR0 HAGOPIAN;

Yes , hs can, he can plead guilty ana

take an appeal and it automatically wipes out the —
QUESTION : Exactly.
MR» HAGOPIAN%

You can't, do that in Massachusetts»

You plead guilty and —
QUESTION3

Well, I understand that, but you're

suggesting that if he elected in Colten, under the Kentucky
system, that he could have a jury trial in the first tier?
MR® HAGOPIAN;

Yes®

That also was established in a case called Leraieux
vs a Robbins«,

In the Maine procedure you could plead guilty

and do the same thing, and the First Circuit sustained that
procedure*
QUESTION; Well, I know, but it. isn't quite the
same thing to say you can plead guilty and then have a jury
trial in an upper court#
MR® HAGOPIAN;
QUESTION;

And to say that you can have —
Yes„

That's right®

Well, all right»

Yes.

Now, which is it in

•tli© Col ten case?
MR. HAGOPIAN;

Well, because you have a right to

a jury trial in Colten in the first tier, than I think that
if you plead guilty, it's certainly different than if you

52
didn't have that opportunity for the jury trial»
QUESTION %

Well, I cru frank to say I didn't recall

that about the Kentucky system»

I knew that you could plead

guilty and automatically get a jury trial when you appealed»

MR» HAGOPXANs

Yes»

But you have that right for

the jury trial in the —*
QUESTIONS

You. can elect —

MR» HAGOPlANs

oh, yes»

And there are 16 juris­

dictions like that»
Lastly, just let me say what happened in Rhode
Island «—
QUESTIONS

Well now, maybe you — but you think

it was true in Colten?
MR» HAGOPIAN %
Honor»

Yes, I know it°s true in Colten, Your

I read that very carefully»

In fact, I believe

■that you even mentioned that fact yourself in a footnote in
Costarelli — excuse ice, or the par curiam court did»
QUESTIONS

All right»

MR» HAGOPIANs

And I think that’s quit© clear»

Let at© just say in Rhode Island, what happens is
if a fellow wants — unless he signs a waiver, a wr.it.tan
waiver for a jury trial in the first tier, the papers are
transmitted right up to the Superior Court an.cl he*s given
his jury trial in the second tier immediately»
