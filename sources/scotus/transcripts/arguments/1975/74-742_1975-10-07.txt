MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Mo. 74-742# Foremost~McKesson# Incorporated,
against Provident Securities Company.
Mr. Moskin, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON MOSKIN# ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOSKINi

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please the

Court;
This case is here on a petition for certiorari to the
Ninth Circuit. Court of Appeals,

It arises under Section 16(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
The Court of Appeals found -that a holder of more than
ten percent -*• that is to say# a beneficial owner of more ‘than
ten percent of the equity securities of petitioner? within
six months of ‘that purchase# which made respondent, such an
equity owner# sold certain of those equity securities# and
realised a profit thereby.
Nevertheless# it found that there was no liability
under the statute because it concluded that the transaction by
which respondent, became a ten percent, beneficial owner was not
one that met the requirements of a Section 16(b) purchase.
To come to that conclusion# it relied upon a proviso
in Section 16(b) which provides that the subsection shall not
be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner

4
was not such, both at the time of the purchase and sale, or
the sale and purchase of the security involved.
This decision by the Court of Appeals was contrary
to all of the pre-existing authority, particularly that of the
Second and Eighth Circuits, and the Stella case is the case
which we contend is -the — was and should remain the prevailing
authority on the point,

\

The key facts all arose in a two-month, period, in
September and October of 1969.
On September 25th in 1969 petitioner and respondent
entered into an agreement

I pause to note that the statute

provides that a purchase is defined to include an agreement to
purchase, and a sale is defined to include an agreement to
sell.

The agreement was one by which respondent would exchange

some $54 million of its assets, roughly two-thirds of this
personal holding company’s assets, in exchange for four and a
quarter million dollars in cash and just under $50 million o*
debentures "which were immediately convertible into common
stock of Foremost-McKesson,
On the 13th of October, two days before the closing
under that agreement, the shareholders of Provident met
informally to consider what their agenda described as the
Section 16(b) problem.

They went on, two days later, to close

this transaction and acquired, at that point in time, $40 million
of immediately convertible debentures.

5

Five days later another $7,5 million of these
convertible debentures were delivered pursuant to adjustments
in the closing price under the agreement.
The next day» on the 21st of October» respondent
entered into an agreement along with petitioner and Dillon,
Read and Company, on behalf of an underwriting group, to call:
§25 million of these convertible debentures,

ted the closing

under that underwriting agreement took place on October 28th.
Respondent will undoubtedly stress two additional
facts, and I would like to put those before the Bench at this
time as well.

They are that on October 13th, the aay when the

shareholders informally root to consider the "Section 16(b)
problem**, the board of Provident also adopted a so-called
liquidating dividend, one which did not fix any specified date
for th© liquidating dividend and which was subject to various
contingencies and other legal requirements, inc? i,’.
that under California law debtors and others with claims
against the company would have to fee satisfied before any
liquidation could take placa.
On -«* the second point, which perhaps they will stress
or emphasise or report to you is that on October 24th, between
the date th® underwriting agreement was signed and the date it
was closed there was a distribution of §22,250,000 face amount
of these debentures to shareholders of Provident,
concade that --

tod we

6

QUESTIONS

You are now on the seven days between the

21st and the 28th?
MR. MOSKINs

Yess, Your Honor.

And we concede that had that liquidating distribution
taken place before the 21st, there would not be Section IZH:'.
liability.

We concede that on the authority of the Reliance

Electric case.
Now then, this ease began when respondent sought a
declaratory judgment in the Federal District Court, because it.
wished to liquidate and dissolve.

The Court, on what

considered equitable considerations, found for respondent.
The Ninth Circuit opinion afrirmed but, in the process,
.rejected all ©f the arguments that, had been made by respondent.
And they said, among other things, that there was sufficient
cooperation between the parties prior to the purchase, su-.lt
as could give rise to the possibility of obtaining inside
information at that point in time.
They also said that between the purchase date and
■the sal® date, that there was an opportunity to exchange in
speculative abuse and they went on to add that it was the wry
kind of speculative abuse with which the statute was designed to
cope.
I would like to just stress s. few brief factual
items in the Appendix on the first of those two points, the
pr@~purchas@ cooperation.

Because Provident's brief, at page

7
38, States that it is undisputed that negotiations only
involved an evaluation of Provident's assets»

Not only is

there nothing in the record to support that, but there are,
indeed, items in the record to support tee contrary inference«
I would call your attention to page A41 in the
record, where Mr» Haskell of Dillon, Read, appearing before
the Department of Corporations ©f California, on the 25th of
September, points out teat Provident had hired Dillon, Read,
•the previous

September to explore possibilities and that the”-5’

went into a great detail with a number of these companies and
”examineds all of these companies.

They then settled upon

Foremost as the most likely participant in a transaction to
provide liquidity to its shareholders, and on A46 they go on

to say, Mr. Haskell doss, that*

We think the deal is fair

because the quality of the securities that we are getting
teat is to say, petitioner’s securities *»«» is of sufficiant
quality and condition where we think that they represent- a .
fair marketable security for the Provident shareholders.
And then on A74, the chief executive officer of
Provident observes in an affidavit that when the Foremost
partnership, if you will, or deal had been decided as the
most promising, "there followed throughout the late summer and
early fall intense negotiations between Foremost and Provident.
QUESTIONs
MR. MQSKXNs

What page did you say that was?
That last w4s in an affidavit at page

8
2174»

Hr, de Liiaur's affidavit.
The Ninth Circuit relied, I think, on two things;

first, it purported to find legislative history to support its
conclusion in respect of the proviso.
There are.a number of answers t© this contention,
/

perhaps the most compelling is that this Court, in Reliance
Electric, said that the legislative history does not explain
the proviso.
Moreover, neither -the District Court nor the Court of
Appeals in the Stella case found any legislative history that
bore on the explanation of the proviso back in 1956? and the
t

Securities and Exchange Commission, which has submitted amicus
briefs to this Court in Reliance and earlier to the Second
Circuit Court in Stella, found soma scraps of legislative
history to the contrary to support petitioner’s contention
her®,
in addition to;which the dissent in the Stella case,
by Judge Hencks, was one that conceded that there was no
/

applicable legislative

history in respect of the proviso.

It is an interesting point to note that Judge Hencks
in his dissent concluded ‘that the principal reason for his
judgment

that the proviso require that there be a purchase

subsequent to becoming a ten percent stockholder was that, in
his mind, was clearly required in respect of directors and
officers, a position that Mr, Chief Justice Burger found in

9
error thr©e years later when he sat and decided in the Second
Circuit for unanimous court the case of Adler v. Rlawans.
Moreovar^ Judge Wallace, himself, in the Ninth Circuit
I think was a little inconsistent cn this legislative history
point, because when he earn© to consider the meaning of “at the
time of purchase* and "at the time of sale”, he decided that
in respect of the sale, sale meant "simultaneously with"
rather than "prior to",
Therafora, he looked to the purposes of th® statute
rather than to the legislative history to define the same words
"at th© time of purchase and sale" differently in respect of the
purchase than in respect of the sale»
It is also interesting -that neither Provident nor
Gulf & Western, in toe case tost was decided last week in the
Seventh Circuit, saw fit to urge th® point about this 'proviso
and the meaning of both "at toe tima of purchase and sale"0
It was never argued in the Ninth Circuit by either party.

And

in the Gulf 5 Weetern case in the Seventh Circuit, it was only
after the Provident case was decided in the Ninth Circuit that
supplementary papers were submitted by Gulf & Western and
consequently by Allis-Chalmers to support the then novel theory
of toe Ninth Circuit»
And, incidentally. the Seventh Circuit, expounds still
another view of the meaning of these words,"both at the time of
purchase and sales'".

A meaning which I suggest and believe is at

11
holdings at the time of the purchase — or, indeed, at the
time of the purchase or sale.
■

You

remember earlier I spoke about the statute

defining contract to buy and contract f.o sell as including
purchases and sales.

And surely a director or an officer

could buy and sail a contract without ever obtaining an equity
position and still liability would attach under the statute.
QUESTIONS
MR. MOSKINs

How would that be?
The statute defines directors, officers,

and ten. percent beneficial owners as fiduciaries.
QUESTIONi

It

You’re talking about, a director or someone

separately defined as opposed to a ten percent holder?
MR.MOSKIN;

Yes, Mr. Justice, I am.

QUEST3I0N:

Well, you say s,in a factual situation

such as ours”, are you suggesting that w@ ought to have a
number of case-foy-case analyses of these things?
MR. MOSKIN;

I am not, Your Honor.

all candor, trying to protect my flank.

I am simply, in

I think that

QUESTION: Well, —
MR. MOSKINs

— if you chose to go that route, you

could still find for petitioner in this case.

I don't think

that’s the appropriate way tc go«
QUESTION:
Congress has in mind.
MR. MOSKIN;

That certainly doesn’t seem to b® what
They want-ad a flat rule.
I belle’s/® you are absolutely correct,

12
and 1 agree with that conclusion,
1 think that hopefully it has been established that
in -this case there was at least an ambiguity in what the key
statutory words mean.

That being so, it. is appropriate to look

to the statute as a whole* and to consider the results of the
alternative constructions.
And I suggest, that the on® that best carries out.,
rather than defeats the statutory purposes is the one -that
should be adopted,
I would like to offer a few illustrations.
Under ‘the Ninth and Seventh Circuit views* if within
six months there was a purchase of 50 percent of -fee stock of
an issuer* and all of it was sold within that time at a
profit* there would be no liability.
Similarly., if 3,9 percent of the stock had been
acquired* and than an additional 40 percent had been acquired#
and then all of it had been sold within the same six-month period#
again there would be no liability.
And yet, if you added one share before fch@ sale#
there would be liability for the profit on that one share,
QUESTION?

Of coursa, if the sal© were deferred so

that it took place in seven months rather than six* thera would
be no liability,either,
MR, MOSKINs

That's true.

The statute is arbitrary,

it is designed to deter and I think the purposes of deterrence,

13
the Court — the Congress, as a matter of fact, concluded that
they had to evaluate on the one hand the beneficial purposes
of the statute, and also# on the other# the beneficial purposes
of long-term investments, and concluded teat a six-month
cutoff would b© appropriate to meet both of those countervailing
objectives.

In each of those cases that 1 have postulated, the
director or officer would be liable.
doctrine of Adler v, Klawans.

At least under the

That was a case in which

the

defendant bought stock, sixty days later became a director,
and then within six months of tha purchase sold tee shares.
And the Second Circuit found liability should attach, because
of the purposes of the statute.
And, as a matter of fact, in teat case Mr. Chief
Justice Burger wrote that:

at some moment before making a sale

of stock, tea insider was in an official position, white he
could have used to influence the sal© price.
That brings me to what I think is the appropriate
interpretation of this statute, to wit, that it doesn't matter
whether you acauira this information before or after tee
initial transaction, so long as it exists prior to the closing
transaction, the second of the two transactions#
And there is again
that view.

authority is legion to support

Mot only tee Adler v# Klawans case, but I think

that in Kern.Counts this Court looked to — at least examined

14
into the question of whether or not there was a possibility of
abuse between the date of the purchase and the date of the sale,
I think, too, if you consider the language in Adler
and other places to the effect that the theory here is that 'the
director» officer, or the beneficial holder is a fiduciary, and
look to common-law concepts, it should not matter whether the
fiduciary

abuses his trust before or after he becomes a

fiduciary, so long as the abuse of trust has taken place prior
to the point when the sale occurred and the profit was
realised.
QUESTION;

Mr. Moskin, I suppose you’re coming to

this, but why do you think the statute, through the proviso,
draws a distinction between a ten percent holder and an officer
and a director?
MR. MOSKIN;

I think the statute draws that

distinction, Mr. Justice Powell, because there is some
difference between a holder of something under

ten percent

be it one or eight1or nine, and the Congress said ten — and
a director and an officer.
Th© legislative history makes clear that onee you
gat to ten percent — and at one point it was five percent that
they were talking about — that you have the potential for
control,for manipulation that justifies your being treated the
same as a director or officer.
N°w# Reliance Electric mad© it quite clear that this

15
means 'that in a step-up or step-down transaction there cannot
be a liability attached if tlx© transaction is structured in
an appropriate way# so that on© — put it this way?

if this

purchase here had been 9„9 parcent in on© transaction and
then some additional amount in ids© second transaction# this
proviso would only catch the profit on the second transaction,,
Just as in Reliance# this Court found that the profit
was only caught on the step-down transaction that got you from
whatever it was# 12 point something, to 9.9 „
QUESTIONS

But if the statute doss make a distinction

between —
MR, MQSKINs Absolutely.
QUESTION?

— the security holder# on the on® hand#

the officer and director on the other —
MR. MOSKINs

It does only in respect to the proviso.

I think# for example# earlier where the statute talks about
the purpose -- there*s a kind of a preamble in 16(b)# which
says !ifor the purpose of preventing the unfair use of informa­
tion which may have bean obtained by such beneficial owner#
director# or officer# by reason of his relationship to the
issuer”* at cetera.

Now# there’s no distinction made there.

And there’s no distinction made in respect to reporting.

The

reporting requirements in 16(a) apply without difference to an
officer# director and ten percent stockholder.
That reporting is required the moment one becomes a

16
ten percent stockholder,, or, rather, within ten days thereafter.

QUESTION* Right»

But the basic purpose of the Act

is to reach people who have inside, information,

Tell me, as &

practical matter, how a ten percent stockholder, who does not
have a representative on the board, obtains inside information
lawfully»
MR» MQSKINs Well, 1 would answer -that in several
ways»

One, the statutory history suggests that one need not

fe© a director or officer when he owns as much as ten percent
of a. public company to control the election of directors and
officers, to manipulate the behavior of the management in a
way that it will go down to his benefit.
In addition to that, the Ninth Circuit Court found
the potential for speculative abuse in this very case, both
before, as I said earlier, ih respect to the increased
negotiations and the cooperation between the parties, and
subsequent, when it, said in the act 'that Provident passed on
to Foremost included the large bundle of real estate and some
relatively illiquid securities.
That real estate was such that it could have required
““ and Provident would have known this better than anybody else
substantial expenditures of cash to develop that property.
So that they might have learned in these negotiations that
Foremost would not pay a dividend, next time because it needed
to preserve the cash, so that it could proceed to develop these

17
properties.
What Provident was doing here was protecting itself
against a market risk»
QUESTION:

Would you have to have inside information

to draw that inference from the cash picture here?
MR. MOSKINs Would you have had to?
not have had to.

No,? you would

But the statute doesn’t speak in terms of

’’would have had to.”
QUESTION:
MR. MOSKIN:
QUESTION:

It speaks in terms of the possibility.
And presumptions.
And presumptions.
Yes.

But it’s certainly an inference which any sophisticated
businessman could have drawn.
MR. MOSKIN:

If he knew the nature of the assets

that were transferred from Provident to Foremost.
QUESTION: That wouldn’t foe necessarily inside
information, though, would it?
MR. MOSKIN:

No, it would not.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Moskin, if you were counsel

to a corporation that had a tan percent stockholder, not
represented on the board, would you advise the corporation to
make any information available to that ten percent stockholder
that was not available to all stockholders,
MR. MOSKIN;
I would not.

Not at this point in time, Your Honor.

18

is true.

To that extent# that

The transaction was# nevertheless# 100 percent

voluntary? there was no gun to -the head of the respondent.
He was free to enter into this contract or not# as it saw fit.
And# moreover# it was free to wait six months before it sold.
And# as the Seventh Circuit said in the Bershad case#

19

the responsibility under this statute rests with the fiduciary
to structure the transaction : in a way to avoid the prohibitions
of the statute, because the deterrent effects of the statute
requires that one do that.
QUESTIONS Well, it is a little strange for the
fiduciary relationship, however, to run to Foremost, isn't it,
when it is —
MR, MOSKXNs

No, I think not, Your Honor»

As a matter

of fact, if you v?ill look at the statutory language, the
statutory language in respect of the profit says that the profit
shall inure to arid be recoverable by the issuer»
It has been written and suggested, and you will find
a reference to it in the American Standard case, that that
word Minure“ continued to permit a constructive trust for the
benefit of the issuer»

And that ties right in with my"

contention that this is a fiduciary relationship, that it
produces the fiduciary relationship to which the statuta
addresses itself»
If you look at the alternatives, if you want to “**
perhaps you're suggesting that this may be a windfall profit
to the issuer? if that be so, the alternative is to permit
speculation in inside information within a six-month period
by statutory insiders with iropugnity, unless one can meet the
evidentiary standards of Rule 10b-S.
QUEbTIONs Well, x guess I'm having the same trouble

20

that some of the others indicated as to the source of the
inside information here.
MR. MO SR. I'M s

Let m® say this # -chat all of the history

and the cases under this statute say that one presumes it be
misuse of inside information except in the so-called unorthodox
transaction.
The unorthodox transaction test goes net to whether
©r not there was a profit or whether or not there was an
abuse# but the courts have said?

When you look to the definition

of purchase and sal© in an unorthodox transaction and conclude
in two categories of cases# I believe# that have analyzed them#
that we may not# under the pragmatic theory# find a purchase
or a sale.
Those categories ares

one# an involuntary trans­

action# such as you had in Kerns and# two# a situation where#
in effect# you are not — the economical equivalent of what
you had before is essentially that which you have later# such
as Mr. Justice Stewart’s decision in Ferraiolo v. Newman#

in

the ->*•*
QUESTION* Sixth Circuit.
MR. MOSKINs

— Sixth Circuit.

Thank you.

Moreover# Dlau v. Lamb is another case where simply
there was a transfer of corporate securities from on©
subsidiary to another subsidiary# and the Court# I think
properly# concluded that ther® was no change in the general

21
sense of the term# and therefore that would not sever the
objectives.
But her® they had a clear purchase and a clear sal®,
and I submit that all of the casas say that that is where
your inquiry ends in respect of whether, in fact, there was
a potential for misuse-

of inside information,

QUESTIONS But,you’re asking us to resolve an
ambiguity in the statute,

I don’t think it’s unreasonable

for ns to ask ourselves, in this situation which you want
covered but which your opponent doesn’t, is there a potential
for abuse?

Even though if it were clearly within the statute,

there is no doubt that the congressional presumption would
cover*
MR, MOSKIN3
-v

It is not unreasonable, but I'm

suggesting it is clearly within the statute, because it is •
clearly a purchase and clearly a sale.
And, moreover, I'd like, if I may, to refer to some
language that you, Mr* Justice Rehnquist, wrote again in Blue
Chip, and simply' substitute Stella for the word Bershadf?) , and
16(b) for 10b*
The long-standing acceptance by the Courts, coupled
with Congress’ failure to reject Stella's reasonable interpreta­
tion of the wording of 16(b) — and then I rely on the words
tliat deal with what 10b meant —» argu® significantly in favor
of the acceptance of the Stalls rule by -this court, citing

22

Bl&ujr. Lehman, which was in fact a Section 16(b) case, there
is a longstanding settled acceptance of the law in this»
QUESTION:

Okay,

But now Stella was the other end

of this six-month period, wasn’t it?
MR, MOSKIN:

It was the sale*

QUESTION: Well, but then the reasoning that Judge
Kaufman used, at any rate, was applicable to the other end of
the six-month period*

You’ve got an Eighth Circuit case.

Do you have any more Court of Appeals authorities
than that?
MR* MOSKIN: The Second Circuit has decided this
question at least three times*

Klein v. Norton is one,

Stella is another, Newmark v, RSCO is the third —
QUESTION ?
the Eighth. Circuits $

What do you have besides the Second and
granted that the Eighth Circuit as well

as the Second is a very respectable court hare?
MR, MOSKIN: Do I need more?
QUESTION:

Well, you had this case in the Ninth

Circuit, and now isn’t there recent Seventh Circuit opinion?
MR, MOSKIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, the Seventh Circuit —*
In a decision against you.

So that »*0”

don't have this unbroken line of consistent Court of Appaals
authority of the kind that was referred to in Mr, Justice
Relinquish53 opinion in Blue Chip, do you?
MR, MOSKIN: Well, w® did until the Ninth Circuit

23
QUESTION;

You did until recently,, yes.

QUESTION;

Mr. Moskin, I know your time is running

short, bu I am interested in the date of sale question in this
case.
I would like for you to comment on that be for® ..you
conclude.
MR. MOSKINs

I will do that now, Your Honor»

QUESTION % All righto
MR. MOSKIN s
agreement to sell.

The underwriting agreement was an
On October 21st, whan that agreement was
V

executed, all of respondent's rights and obligations were
fixed.

Th® profit was locked in, so far as it was concerned.

To be sure, there was a condition, a marked-out, as it were,
[writing]
that is standard in und@rri.ding agreements from th© beginning of
time, and which almost never is used; and which would have
given the underwriters a right in an extreme circumstance
during 'that six or seven-day period not .to continue the trans­
action, not to close it.
But if agreement to purchase and agreement to sell
is to mean anything in the context of the statutory definition
of purchase and sal©, it would be a very simple matter,
indsM# £@r a lot of meaningless conditions to b© inserted, into
a contract and to ignore the whole intent of the statute*
QUESTION*

You*re really not suggesting that marked-

out, as you call it, is meaning .less, sr® you?

24
MR, MOSKIN:

Ifc Is meaningless in 99,4 percent of the

cases when underwriting agreements are signed,
QUESTIONS

You testified as to your experience just

now, i*XI testify as to mine.
MR. MOSKINs

I’ve seen them exerciser.,

Well, that’s the .6 percent that I was

describing.
QUESTION: Right.
[Laughter,3
QUESTION;

Your answer is that although there are

valid conditions to the obligation of -the underwriters to
buy, and although the underwriting agreement states that the
date of purchase shall b® the 28th, that because these
conditions are extremely unlikely to happen, nevertheless the
sale occurred on October 21?

.

MR. MOSKIN; That is my answer.
QUESTION; Right,
MR. MOSKINs And I must say it was also Judge Wallace's
answer in the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION; Right.
MR, MOSKIN;

I’d like to take a moment before I

conclude to refer also to Rule 16(b)(2), which was adopted in
1935, in response to an article in the Virginia Law Review by
??
Mr. Husted Sullivan, in which he pointed out that, as he read
ifc then contemporaneously with the adoption of the statute,
the construction for which I contend was required, and it

25
would have prevented underwriters from acquiring securities
and distributing 'thsm^in an underwriting unless the exemption
were provided»

And the SEC obviously agreed with that

construction of the statute and under any number ©£ cmm
with, which this Court has agreed; an agency that is charged with
administering a statute; its views are entitled to a special

You can make your own choice about -that.
MRo MOSKINi

I will do that? if I may.

I said a while back that it rejects the teaching of
reliance as well as its analysis? because it says that a
closing transaction in a purchase first m~ I'm sorry? in a
sale .first? purchase later? is caught? notwithstanding &<u
fact that at the time of that second transaction the
beneficial owner may own 9.9 or lass of the stock.
I believe that to be squarely in the teeth ©f the

OEM. ARGUMENT OF NOBLE K» GREGORY, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR» GREGORY;

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court;
!fd like to start with emphasizing a factual point,
although it's not crucial to the main argument, but it cam®
up end I think it's very important in this case, atAeast from,
the so-called Kern County argument»
Provident was never a fiduciary of this corporation,
Foremost-McKesson,

It was only a creditor»

All it acquired

were convertible debentures which were covered by Section 16(to)
because of their convertible nature»

But I think it's important

to understand that a person coming under 1,6 (b) as a beneficial
owner, technically, is not always the fiduciaryj and this is
a perfect example of it»
The relationship,as very clearly pointed out in many
of the cases, of a convertible debenture owner is that -.o* n
creditor? and all they had was the information after they
became a creditor that a creditor normally v/ould have»
Now, they had knowledge of their own assets, of
course, but 'that was not knowledge that they received as a
result of the relationship? which brings me to what I think 1«?
■the key provision in Section 16 (b) s
For the purpose of preventing the unfair use ©f
information which may have been obtained by a beneficial owner,

21
—* that's a more than a ten percent stockholder — director or
officer, by reason of his relationship to the issuer»
1 think that's the key to interpreting the so-called
proviso or exemption that Section 16(h) shall not h©
construed t© cover any transaction, where such beneficial
owner

that is the more than ten percent stockholder —» was

not such both at the time of the purchase and the sale»
Nov;, Foremost attempts to make a great deal ©£ the
statement in the Reliance Electric case, that there is no
legislative history of the proviso? and that's correct.
There is very little legislative history of the proviso.
But it even goes so far as to take that out of
context, because what the opinion says, that although there
may foe no —» I'm not quoting, I'm paraphrasing — no legislative
history of the proviso, nonetheless, that does not justify
departing from the clear purpose of the statute.
I'll read what the Court said, eo I won’t unfairly
paraphrase?

the proviso cannot b© disregarded simply on the

ground that it may foe inconsistent with our assessment

the

Court's assessment -» of the "wholesome purpose" of the Act.
Now, more important, if, as 2 suggest, thera is
legislative history or this statute —*» and nobody can, demy it?
cind the purpose ciau.se, I think exemplifies that l@gislat.ivs
history» And it is helpful as applied to the facts of the case
at bar, both the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have

28
gone into it at length, and I won’t go into the detail.
But 1 think 1 can clearly state with confidence that
it shows that Congress was concerned with the use of the inside
information by one who is a substantial stockholder before —
and I emphasize there the "before* — he had made a pure!' asa
or an acquisition, or before it was an

.latent to

sell at a

quick profit,
how, I realise they took the intent language out of
the statute and put in a rule; of thumb.

But the point and

the purpose of the statute, which is still in its purpose
clause, which was added when they took out the -» put in the
rule of thumb; or before he sold at a high price with the
expectation of making a quick re-purchase at a lower price;
both of these, as the Seventh Circuit points out, ar© one ends
of a swing. And that's what we’re talking about:

zv ri.rrt rri.....,,

transaction.
i

It shows, in other words, that the aim of Section
16(b) was to discourage large stockholders — and I'm only
talking for the moment about stockholders — from making quick
profits by entering into the short swing transaction becetv**» of
inside information,, received by reasons of their relationship
to the corporation.

That's the proviso which was interpreted

in Kern County Land — and I won’t paraphrase that, I'll try
not to — In Kern County Land, this Court pointed out that the
aim of that statute is the misuse of information obtained after

29
the acquisition of substantial stock ownings not purchases —
and now I am quoting -*» based on inside information obtained
from stockholdings that did not yet exist.
Now* that's the situation here.

Certainly# as I said

a moment ago# Kern had «*« I mean# I’m sorry# Provident had
knowledge of its own assets.

But it

didn't have 'that knowledge

*

as a result of -any relationship to Foremost,
Now# Mr, Moskin has paraded before the Court a
chamber# a detail of horrors# I should say# and any statute
that doesn’t apply to everything.
where it’s not going to apply.

There are always situations

That was recognised clearly

in Reliance# it’s recognised by some of the questions from the
Court.
Obviously this statute naver applies if a stockholder
navesr gets more than nine percent.

He can speculate $ he can

speculate all he wants# as far as 16(b) is concerned# as long
aa he never gets more than nine percent.

Or he can wait the

six months.
Thar© are a lot of other things he can do# and some
©i* th© things h® can do under the statute and under the purposes#
acquire information not as a result of his relationship feo the
corporation but. from a tippa®.

There were provisions in the —

and 1 think that again goes back to the legislative history.
Th© original provisions or early provisions require *»- would
have prohibited that.

30

Because he might have a relationship not to the
corporation by stockholding, but by some other relations, and
get the inside information and make a killing.

And of course

there are remedies for that, and Congress diets!t stop with
16(b).

But 16(b) cannot be made into a device to solve all

problems of inside information or the misuse of it.

It's

only designed by its very terms and its purposes, to prevent
the unfair us© of inside information arising by reason of
the relationship of the corporati,on to the person making the
short

swing transaction.
I think I'd like to go on now to the other ground,

that I would like first to make one point, which I think should
be made.

Mr. Moskin keeps making a great deal of the fact

that I didn't argue this point as strenuously in the Ninth
Circuit.

H© says we didn't make it.

We made it, but we
' ‘V

didn’t urge it orally.
The reason, I think, is obviouss

we had a conflict

with the Second Circuit if we went on that ground. And,
although I’m highly honored to be arguing the case here, my
client is less than happy at the expanse.

I naturally tried to

win on a ground which I -thought would end the case.
But the potential for speculativa abuse point, the
main argument that I made in tee Ninth Circuit, and that based
on the Kem County Land case, I think fits this case very well;
doesn't fit it to a T, it’s not a Whit© Horse case? there never

31
are any.
But there’s two facts which both the Ninth Circuit,
in rejecting it, and Mr. Moskin, attempts to brush over. But
the most important one is the one 1 started with* this lack
of any fiduciary relationship. This was not stock.
The Ninth Circuit opinion treats Provident as the
stockholder.
How, as I say, I don’t deny that 16(b) applies,
because of the convertible nature? but that’s the only reason
it applies, not because Provident went out to buy stock.
Provident went out to sell assets as a part of a liquidation.
The corporation was going into liquidation.

The sole purpose

of this transaction, as far as Provident was concerned «**» and
this is an objective fact — was to liquidate this corporation
to avoid tax consequences, and this was a legitimate method
of complying with the tax laws.
QUESTION s

Who were the beneficial owners of

Provident?
MR. GREGORY s

Heirs of the Crocker estate, Your

Honor.
QUESTION?

Including Mr. Frederick

MR, GREGORY:

c.

Whitman?

1 don’t recall the naras, I'"* corryj

I didn’t bother to check who the particular stockholders were.
QUESTIONS

You don’t know.

MR. GREGORYS

But they were all heirs? that’s all I

32
c©n 'kail you.
It may be in the record, Ifra just not sure.
But they were heirs of the Crocker estate? they had
formed a family corporation to hold certain assets of the
Crocker family.

And they found tax problems an<^ they wanted

to liquidate.
Now, their desire to liquidate was to sell the
assets, and they hired Dillon, Read to find somebody 'that
would buy the assets.

And the only people that were satisfactory

were Foremost, and they thought they had an arrangement with
Foremost whereby they could avoid any problems.
Other problems arose.
they originally designed

If they had carried it out as

unfortunately they didn't — they

would have had no 16(b) problem,
I’d like to mention, too, that although there is an
agenda in which, at the bottom, is a mention of 16(b), the
impression.« I’m sure Mr, Moskin didn’t intend to give, that this
was all designed to get around 16(b), is not borne out by the
record, all it was is that apparently someone mentioned that,
there might be a 16(b) problem,
Th® case cams up on summary judgment, so we don't
have a full detail of that.
Now, the other point is again th® convertible deben»
tures,
Now, it was a condition to the whole agreement to

33

sell the assets to Foremost — and I’m not trying to be
picayune in calling it a sale of assets.

I realise that under

one possible normal construction that any sale of assets to
— for stock, is a technical purchase.

But that’s the whole

point, I believe, to Korn, that where you have sometning tnau
technically may h© a purchase, if it’s not within th© potential
for speculative abuse, that then you look at the realistic
transaction.
Now, the day after th© agreement to sell, the
corporation went into liquidation.

And a corporation in

liquidation doesn't normally engage in speculation, and under
California law it is not permitted to engage in speculation.
The liquidation corporation was n€*ver a stockholder
of Foremost, and as a debenture holder, Provident was only a
creditor, as I said.
There was, as the District Court pointed out, and I
should say this is the ground on which the District Court
decided the case, the ground that it was not a potential for
speculative abuse.
Foremost mad© no claim in the trial court, as the
District Court pointed out, that Provident derived inside
information, profit or advantage, and I’m quoting, from its
all but momentary status as an insider of Foremost.
Foremost claims that Provident had inside information
1 think X covered that? it was insid© information it had

34
by reason of the fact that it was selling it.
Now, even if the information as its own assets could
have given Provident an opportunity, it was not an opportunity
that grows out of the stockholdings.
Mr. Justice Powell, I think, asked about the other
ground that was considered in the ninth Circuit.

The point

there again, we must look at this case in view of the facts
and the purposes, mid I think, as Kern County implies, the
agreement was very clear, the date of sale was after the
1 believe it was October the 28th was to be the date of sale.
I get these dates wrong.
And before that, more than half of these debentures
were distributed to the stockholders of Provident.
Now, there are cases both ways. There are cases that
Mr, Koskin relies on, that you disregard all but the contract,
and that the contract controls.

But I submit, if we follow

the teaching of Kern County, that you look at the transaction
realistically, where there's no potential for speculative
abuse, and you also look at. it technically from the contract
law point of view that there was no sal® until all of these
conditions were — had passed.
Now, there are two other arguments, neither one of
which —» I think Mr, Moskin misspoke himself when he said -the
Ninth Circuit passed on them.

Neither the Ninth Circuit nor

the trial court passed on the other two arguments.

I think

35

they are perhaps not ones that this Court wants to pass on#
but I do want to mention that there are questions of whether
this comas within th© exception for a liquidating agent# under
California law# when this liquidation plan was adopted,

Th®

corporation# the directors became liquidating agents# they
held the stock only for the beneficiaries.
In addition# under California law# one© they passed
a dividend which they did in distributing dividends# that
stock in Foremost — I beg your pardon# the debentures in
Foremost evolved upon the beneficiaries# and there was no
beneficial interest.
Those are matters primarily of California

law.

Neither th® District Court nor the Court of Appeals passed on
them# and I hope they never have to.
I think that th© other arguments are sufficient# and
I suggest that this Court should follow th© clear learning
©f the legislative history and the clear purpose of this
statute# and if so they will find that this does'not come
within Section 16(b),
QUESTION?
met?

In your view# when were th© conditions

At what point after October 21st?
MR. GREGORY t

The conditions were in existence until

the actual transfer of the debentures under the underwriting,
Your Honor.

Because there was that condition.

•th® express date.

It's provided

This would b© the date of sal©# and until

36

that time the underwriting could be set aside for various
conditions»

And prior to -that time# the stock# over half the

stock# or over half the debentures# were distributed to the
individuals»
As you may recall# originally all of the debentures -QUESTION?

Was that October 24?

MR. GREGORY: I believe 24 was when they war®
distributed.
QUESTION:

But that was pursuant to# as I understand

it# a liquidating resolution of October 13-th# was it?
MR. GREGORV;

That's right# Your Honor.

QUESTION: That preceded the actual agreement# the
underwriting agreement# which was October 21?
MR, GREGORY: That’s correct# Your Honor.
QUESTION: And than on October 24 the liquidating
resolution was executed# is that it?
MR. GREGORY:

That’s correct.

And then the sale actually took place on# I believe
it’s the 31st.
QUESTION:

Mr, Gregory ~

MR. GREGORY:

My

There itf&s a voluntary

Thera was an option agreement which was

completely voluntary in the same sense that this was voluntary.
‘They didn’t have to enter into it.
of course, they-were bound by it.

Ones -they entered into it,
But the only involuntary

thing that Occidental couldn’t do anything about was the
converts ion,
But this Court had two sales in the Kern County case,
one was the conversion, the other was the option agreement
which was entered into willingly.

But under the duress of the

commercial transaction.
But I could hardly call that involuntary, any more
than Mr. Moskin seams to think that we’re claiming that
Foremost «- I mean that Provident involuntarily sold its
assets.

It didn’t involuntarily sail it3 assets.
And in the sense that it could have not taken this

offer, and not liquidated, it was voluntary.

But the form
