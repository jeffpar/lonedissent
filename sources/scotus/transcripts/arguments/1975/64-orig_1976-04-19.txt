P R O CEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We v/ill hear arguments

first this morning in Mo. 64 Original, State of Mew Hampshire
against the State of Main®.
Mr. Bradley, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD F. BRADLEY* JR.*
ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT
MR. BRADLEY:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is a dispute between the States of Mains and

New Hampshire over fchea location of their lateral marine
boundary in the Piscataqua River and Gosport Harbor and the
intervening marine area.
The legal issue in this case is the proper interpreta­
tion of the 1740 boundary doera© of the King of England which
describes the boundary in these areas.

Maine's original

interpretation of the decree was an extended thalweg line in
Piscataqua Harbor and Gosport Harbor intersecting in the
intervening marine areas.
New Hampshire's original line is a "lights on range8*
line connecting Fort Point to Whaleback Light.

It was Maine's

enforcement of its lobster regulations in the intervening
marina area between these two lines which led to regulatory
conflict and an attempt to resolve fch© boundary through boundary
commissions.

This attempt failed.

Subsequent enforcement

action led to conflict between enforcement officers of both

Statas and an executive moratorium or. enforcement to permit
New Hampshire to file a complaint in this cases.
New Hampshire filed that complaint on June 6, 1973,
and a Master, Justice Thomas Clark, was appointed on November 5,
1973.

Soon after his appointment Justice Clark mat with

counsel for Maine and New Hampshire t.o urge the States to
settle this disputa and to avoid long and disruptive? litigation
with great expanse to the people of both States,
Counsel accepted this recommendation and met to review
principles of law which would determine the location of the
boundary and the proper interpretation of the description in
the 1740 decree.

They were able to reach agreement on this

and they filed a joint motion for consent decree on September 23
1973.

On February 27,- 1975, the stipulated record in support

of that joint '.notion for consent was submitted to the Special
Master and -the case was finally submitted without oral argument
oft March 17, 1975.
After reviewing the stipulated record and the consent
di:icx€,n

submitted by the States, the Special Master decided that:

hr#' had to reject th© consent decree because h® believed that
the court was.without jurisdiction to enter and also because he
fait th© geographic middle rather than thalweg was th© proper
interpretation of th® word "middle" in the boundary description.
The State of Main® has taken exceptions to both, these
determinations.

But before discussing our excaptions, I would

5
IJJca to describe to the Court the substantial prejudice which th©
Special Master*» rejection of the consent decreef adoption of
th® geographic middle lino, and also his failures to^hear full
argumentation on th.® issues below has

caused to the interests of

the State of Main©.
First, of course, wrs have lost to the Shat®, of K®w
Hampshire by th® Master*» description, of th© new line 636 acres
of land in the intervening marina area, land which is in dispute
between New Hampshire and Main© fishermen and presents a great
emotional issue in both. States.
QUESTIONS

Nhat’s that?

MR. DRADLEYs

About one square mile?

Your Honor, th© way I visualise it is

that it’s about two and a half times the area between th®
Capitol and th® Lincoln Memorial.
QUESTIONS

There are about 640 acres in a square mile.

MR. BRADLEY;

OE if that’s what it is.

That’s my

viau&1 reference.
But we don’t feel that that 636 acres —
QUESTION?

This area is off the coastline?

MR. BRADLEYS
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

Or do you include in that anything in the

harbor?
MR. BRADLEY:

No, we hava mad® no calculation of th®,

area that we may have lost in the harbor.
As much objection as we have to the lost 636 acres,

6

vm fe@l that w® have bssm much raor© greatly prejudiced by the
Master's adoption of an equidistant boundary in the Piscataqua
River»

Th© Master, at page 43 of his report, indicated that

it wouldn’t be necessary for purposes of this dispute to delimit,
that boundary, but because we ar© going to have to live with,
it, we have asked State Bapartmsnt Office of th® Geographer
to do a rough approximation of what an equidistant lin© would look
like,

And they have done it on a' map teat refers also to the

thalweg, which we distributed just prior to the argument.
As you can see, it*s an extremely irregular line
which would be very, very difficult to mark on th® water and
would give rise to great opportunities for th© kinds of
jurisdictional and regulatory conflict which gave rise to th®
dispute in this case.
QUESTION?

You have submitted this map?

MR, BRADLEY %
It8s not. evidence.

Your Honor, it's really demonstrative.

It wouldn't h© th® line that you would

adopt in a decree or anything like that.
QUESTION?

You wouldn't suggest the thalweg is going

to be a straight line like that, do you?
MR. BRADLEY:

Your Honor, it was la th® consent decree.

It was marked by a rang© line —
i

QUESTION:

You wouldn't really suggest that's tea way

it is, would you?
MR. BRADLEY:

It's pretty near teat, your Honor.

7
QUESTION?

A straight line?

A thalweg?

Th© deepest

channel in a river, a line like that?
MR.BRADLEY:
QUESTION?

In this river, the channel —
That‘s incredible.

MR. BRADLEY?
QUESTION:

The line you agreed upon, is that it?

MR. BRADLEY:
QUESTION:

It may b® incredible, sir, but ~~

Yes, sir.

And it was based upon the —

It's not a thalweg, though.

That*s where

you agree it is'.
MR. BRADLEYs

Your Honor, it's the main ship channel.

It’s the channel that ships actually —
QUESTION:

Maybe it8s misnamed thalweg, but in any

©vent on this map the straight line is the line upon which the
agreement was reached.
MR. BRADLEY:
QUESTIONs

Y@S, sir.

May I ask a question while I hav© you

interrupted?
MR. BRADLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes®, your Honor.

Is there any question in the case?

I

notice New Hampshire isn't quite as happy with that agreement
now as perhaps it. was at the tins® it was mad®.

But the New

Hampshire legislature never did agrees with that agreement, did
it?

;
MR. BRADLEY:

No, your Honor.

>

QUESTION:

Is there any question

of th@ validity of

a
th® executive — of Hew Hampshire — maybe I should ask your
adversary wh@uher it's a. question of stata law.
May there be an agreement of this kind without approval
of the legislature of Hew Hampshire?
MR. BRADLEY:

Your Honor, the position of the Stata

of Maine is that this is not an agreement; it's merely a
suggested judicial resolution which the Special Master has the
power to eater as a proper exercise of' the original jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I know, but. it depends, does it not, upon

th® consents of both tho States?
MR. BRADLEY:

Your Honor, it’s not a consent to which

both States war® bound, as we have seen by the actions and
behavior of the State of New Hampshire in this case today,
and neither State has felt bound to enforce it on their
citizens or th® citizens of other States.

It had no binding

effect until it was adopted by th® court and entered.
This is really our

response to one of the sugg@stion.is

the Special Master has made.
QUESTION:

Do

xm

have before us th® case of an

alliance, whatever you call it, constant, or what, jointly
submitted by the two Statas?
MR. BRADLEY:

Do

xm

have that still?

It is a lias which th.® New Hampshire

legislature does not agree with and never agreed with it.
Neither State could agree with it through the political
process.

Th© counsel for both States, through th© Attorney

s
Generals * off .ices, mad® a determination that this was the
appropriates interpretati ©a through legal principles 0g tls©
decree and suggested it to the Special Master.
indicated that they don’t agree with. it.

They have not

They have just, found

the answers — the Master's reasons for r@ject.ing it unanswerable.
I don't take it that that means they rejected it.

Shay are

just finding that if he is correct, that they would assert a
different line in this case.

That is, if ha is correct about

rejecting thalweg and the lack of jurisdiction of the court,
that they would have applied the principias differently to
obtain a different line.

But it made no statement about

whether they reject —
QUESTIONS

Is the ship channel

you referred to an

artificial channel that has been dredged out?
MR. BRADLEYs
Honor.

I really don’t know the answer, your

I believe that it’s —
QUESTIONS

Is it marked by buoys?

MR. BRADLEYt

It's marked by buoy in Gospcrt Harbor.

It's marked by the range lines in Piscataqua River which @r©
lights connecting

bo

that mariners can determine whether

they are on the main channel as they com® into the river.
QUESTIONS

Is there any authority from tills Court

as to whether a proposed consent decree needs the ratification
of the legislative branches of the two States?
MR. BRADLEYs

Yes, your Honor, I believe that there

10
Is.

I f©al that th© cas© of 'Ylrglaie. v, Tnr.n@£;s<se determined

that not all compacts and agreements require legislative
approval and that only when the parties have don© everything
they can to hind themselves to an agreement that legislative
approval is required.
QUESTIONS

Now, that's congre a niona1 approval.

Is

that legislative — I was thinking in terms of what sort of
authorization do counsel 'representing two States in an original
action in tills Court need in order to consent?
MR. BRADLEY:

I think New Hampshire's answer to that

in its motion to support the jurisdiction of a Special Master
to enter the consent decree - which was filed with the Special
Master# and I honestly .don't have it in my mind, the principles,,
but they have answered that with, respect to their authority
and determined at that time that their Attorney General did
have authority to enter it.
QUESTIONs

What if both of the States, if the two

States entered into the agreement which you hav*. entered into
and then moved to dismiss the original action by stipulation of
both parties, ‘then there would be no original action left,
would there?
MR. BRADLEY:
QUESTION:

That’s right, your Honor.

Would the terms of that agreement, thin,

&ntered into between the two States., present problems of
enforceability if citizens of on© State or the other elected

11
not to comply with it?
MR, BRADLEY:
QUESTION:

Y@s, your Honor .

I believe —

That’s why you want this Court's action,

■T take it»
MR» BRADLEYs

Y@s, your Honor,

Iter® is no question

that if agreement was; reached outside the context of your
exercise of regional jurisdiction, that we would have to find
congressional approval under Article I, Section 10,

the

compact clause.
Th® point 'that I started to mate with Mr. Justice
Rehnquist was that the only time that is required one® th©
original jurisdiction has been exercised ,is never required, once
th® original jurisdiction has been exercised, because nothing
the parties do in th® context, of th® exercise binds them until
tii® Court has exercised its judicial power.
In the cas<i that I cited, Virginia v. Tennessee,
148'U.S. 503, the States of Virginia and Tennessee entered into
preliminary boundary agreement

prior to entering into binding

boundary agreement, «ad th® Court naturally held that all
compacta and agreements don’t require congressional approval
and it's only when fete States do something that actually

binds

themselves independent of th© judiciary, I believe, or outside
the context of original jurisdiction, that the approval of
Congress is required.

And that is consistent with ’the reasons

that congressional approval is required in the first place.

12
which was to protect the United States' interest against
compacts and agreements by the States which would affect
Federal interests.

It has been held a long time in this Court

that the exercise of judicial power is a satisfactory substituta
for congressional approval when original jurisdiction is
exercised,

had w® believe that th© Court has jurisdiction to

enter th® decree in this ease.
QUESTION:

What action# if any, has either of the

legislatures taken on this?
MR. BRADLEYs
taken no action.

Th© State of Main® legislature has

Th® State of New Hampshire# both Houses# as

I understand# have passed concurrent resolutions rejecting th®
deers©, but has not passed any law which is binding on them.
And that's th® matter of their State lav? which I
QUESTION?

But yoiar legislature has don© nothing.

MR. BRADLEY:
QUESTION:

Our legislature has done nothing.

Mr. Bradley# if th® Special Master had

accepted th© consent, decree, . would the location of th© line
•i

have been self-evident?

Would th© decree its®If have

identified th® precise location of the —
MR» BRADLEY:

Yes, your Honor# ‘die decree does#

which is the location of th© thalweg and th© determination' of
th© thalweg end th® straight line portion of the boundary
by latitudes and longitudes.
QUESTION s

And th© Attorney General of New Hampshire

13
then agreed at on© tiro® to the location of the line.
MR. BRADLEY:

Yes, your Honor, in filing that motion

for joint judgment, he indicated that he not only agreed with
it, hut it was the appropriate application of law and fact
and ifc was in the best interest of the State of New Hampshire
at that time.
QUESTIONS

General, could you tell m© what legal .

principi© will support this straight line in the harbor?
MR. BRADLEYs

The principi® which supports it is

the principi#, of main channel or thalweg.
QUESTION:

You don't really suggest that on the

ground that's wh®r® you would find the thalweg.

You haven't

even attempted to say where the thalweg is, have you?

You

have just agreed that's where it is.
HR. BRADLEY*

we have agreed to it by reference to charts which indicate
the depths of the water and the, what we — I understand —

MR, BRADLEYs

Thalweg doesn't mean where mariners

Thalweg means the deepest part of the channel.

MR, BRADLEY:

The main part of the channel.

Mariners sail what's safe to sail and

if a straight line is aor® convenient, they sail a straight

MR, BRADLEY:

The indication that this is th©

safest place to sail and therefore th® deepest is the largest
vessels that coma into th© area stay right on that range line
all the time they ax® coming in.

They don't deviate from it.

MR. BRADLEYs

You would have jurisdiction,, I believe,

You could still reject it as an

inappropriate application of law to fact without respect to
your jurisdiction.

You could reject: it certainly for other

reasons than the lack of jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Suppose that you concluded that th© 1740

or something in history indicated that the thalweg was not the

QUESTION:

Mo, your Honor, not in this —

"is that' -another reason that you might

MR. BRADLEY:
it.

Yes, it might b® a reason for rejecting

Th© point that we are making in this case is that every
0

indication in 'the boundary proceedings was that thalweg was
meant when, the tana "middle" was used.

The Special Master has

referred to soma of th® evidence we refer to in our brief with

17
regard to the use of the channel in the; Merrimack River and
also with regard to deeds relied on by Massachusetts which
referred to the channel of Piscataqua.
Thor® are two indications , though, that war® not
cited in the brief or referred to by the Special Master which
we think are a strong indication that channel was
meant when the tern "middle" was used.

The first of these is

the Charter of King Charles II to Rhode Island in 1664 which
was issued just before the.Charter issued to Btew Hampshire
la 1679.

That Charter is described in Shocks Island v, Massachn-

setts at 37 U.S. 464? and in that Charter,King Charles, the
person who issued it — one of the boundary determinations
that was in the line title that the Boundary Commissioners were
determining indicated that the definition of "middle"'was
channel.

Thus when h© was describing the location of the

boundary between Connecticut and Shod® Island to the 'south, he
Indicated that it went to the middle or to the channel of a
river there commonly called and known there by the name of
P&wcatuck.

We think this is a contemporaneous indication that

thalweg was in vogue and haing used at the time the decree was

•isntsrod.
The Master has seised upon the us© of the word "the
half" in New Hampshiress petition for appeal as apparently th®
strongest: basis for adopting geographic middle.

And w® found

a passage in Belknap, History of New Hampshire, which indicatas

18

how insignificant th?; use of "the half” is in a Ascription of
that, boundary.

Thus, it is clear that the State of New

Hampshire in authorising the appeal didn't use the word "the
half,"

The only time it was used is by the Solicitor for th®

State of Naw Hampshire who was someone who had been hired and
was in England and filing papers before the King's counsel
in th© petition for appeal.

And the passage in Belknap which

is very, very short 1 would just like to read because it
Ascribes th© relationship between the Solicitor in England
and New Hampshire’s actual intention.

And he says:

oblige ns to malt® bricks without straw.

"They

Above all, why did

they not send a copy of their own appeal?

For want of it, I

have been forced to guess what that appeal was from loose
?

passages in Mr. Ado's letters.n

So th® Solicitor who used the

word Rthe half” had to gu@ss at what New Hampshire was doing
back in th® colonies.»

Ha didn’t; have any dir act information

from New Hampshire when he used the word "half."

W© believe

this undercuts the Master3© strong linos on th© us© of th®
word "half" to determine geographic middle.
QUESTION:
page citation?

Mr. Bradley, will you let us have the

We might have trouble finding that.

MR. BRADLEY:

Certainly.

That’s page 251, Belknap's

History of New Hampshire.
Finally, I would like to also note on th® us© of the
word "th® half" in the petition for appeal was the second time

19
that Mew Hampshire had uE©d that word.

Tilts first time they

used it,' they used it with regard to navigational criteria
and not criteria based on geometric concepts such as
geographic middle.

Thus, in the boundary proceedings they

indicated that; the half of the isles of Shoals was divided by
th® harbor or road which lay between.

How, this is a clear

reference to navigational us© of the area and it’s consistent
with the us© of thalweg or channel in the other portion of the
northern boundary and not with the Master's adoption of a
geometric concept to determine the meaning of the word "middle.’’
1 would like to reserve the rest of my time.

MR» UPTON,

350 yards.

It makes a difference

because it deflects the straight line boundary all the way
from there up to the Isles of Shoals,, a distance of six miles.
The deflection of that line at that point, 350 yards, makes
a difference of 300 acres to New Hampshire over the whole
area *
QUESTION;
MR. UPTON;

Would the lines be parallel?
They are not;

they converge, your

Honor, at one point at the Isles of Shoals.

It's a long

V~shaped gore.
QUESTION;

I see

QUESTION;

Mr. Upton, since you are interrupted, I

am kind of new at this kind of litigation.

What is the

standard of review that we should apply in deciding how gross
the error of the Master must be before we take another look
at it?
MR. UPTON;

As I view it, the Master's resport is

entitled to a strong presumption of correctness.
QUESTION;

So it's not enough for you merely to

persuade us that he might have done a better job.
MR. UPTON;

If he committed an error of law, of

course, questions of law may always ba corrected in this Court.
QUESTION;

1 didn't understand you to contend, that

it: would never in any situation be appropriate to use these
low-water projections, whatever they are called.

You are just

24

saying in this particular case they are inappropriate.
MR. UPTON:

I say, your Honor, that it's contrary

to any of the precedents in international law that I have
been able to find.

Xfc3s contrary to tha the precedents in

international law that 1 have been able to find, it's contrary
to the holdings of all the writers in this field that we have
cited on pages 7

to 9 in our brief, and it's contrary to

the holdings of this Court in United States v. Louisiana.
QUESTION:

Were those holdings on particular fact

situations, or do you read those as saying as a matter of law
it's never appropriate to use the standard?
MR. UPTON:

Your Honor, one of the tests they use

is that proposed by Mr, Boggs, the former Geographer of the
State Department,to draw parallel lines from the end of each
offshore formation to the shore.

And if the amount of water

area between the island or offshore formation and the shore
is greater than the offshore formation, then it can’t be
assimilated tc the shore and used as a point of reference.
In this situation, this is obviously too small and
too far removed from the shore to qualify under that test.
And I understand that approach is almost a question of law.
Now, both parties have in their briefs gone farther
than to argue merely the point of whether a measurement should
be made from these offshore formations, whether they are
properly a part of tha bank of the river from which one should

25

measure, and

have gone into the analogy of various articles

of the Geneva Convention of the Territorial Ssa .

Now, we

may have complicated matters by doing this, but we feel
obliged to go into it because the Master did»

And he used it

to justify what he had dons here»
I think it all steins from Article XII of the Geneva
Convention of 1958, which states that the territorial sea
outside of internal waters should be divided between States
whose coastlines are adjacent by the median line principle,
measured from the nearest points on each State's baseline»
Now , the Master has apparently applied this analogy
to internal waters, because we are here in internal waters
inside the closing line of the harbor,

Whether one looks at

it by Maine's standpoint, or by New Hampshire's standpoint.
But I urge to the Court that if we are to apply this analogy
of international law to internal waters, it ought to be done
with extreme care» and with an eye to the real purposes of the
convention,

To do it, we have to consider Maine and New

Hampshire as foreign States having opposing coastlines on
each side of the river.

But this is a very narrow river.

Itvs a little over a calls and a half wide at the mouth, and
it «arrows down as we go further inland.

Now, how would

coastal baselines be drawn on each side of the river from
which to measure the median line or boundary?

And we. say that

xi this analogy is to be followed at all, Article III should

26

be usedf that Is , the normal baseline follows the low-water
line on the mainland, that islands should only be considered
part of the shore if they qualify in the tests of United States v.
Louisiana, that is, if their size and closeness makes them
really an integral part of the mainland, and that the use of
low-tide elevations, that is, rocks exposed only at low tide
as part of the base line, is optional under international law
and to use these as measuring points in such close waters is
apt to create distortion and unequal division of the waters of
the river =

And that's just what it v.rould do if this happens.

I think it is demonstrated.
At the very least, a low-tide elevation should not
have mere influence than an island, but if the Master is
correct, he would foe giving it that effect, and we say that
that was his principal error.

Otherwise, we have no objection

to his report.
New, Maine has referred to Article IV of the
Convention which is an optional method of drawing long, straight,
baselines.

It’s optional, not mandatory.

And it was fathered

by the decision of the international court of justice in the
Anglo-Norwegian fisheries case in 1951.

It's optional.

It

applies to the peculiar coastline that was found off Norway
with many deeply indented fjords.

It's not appropriate to

apply by analogy to closely bounded internal waters, and the
decision was never accepted by the United States Government.

27
In fact, although it was advocated by California, it was not
followed in United States v. California, and. to use this
method and to use Whaleback Reef would cause much more than
a 15 percent departure from the general direction of the main
shore, which was the maximum thought permissible in the
Ang1o-Norwegian case *
Wow, turning to the point that occupied the Court's
attention when Maine was arguing the rejection of the motion
for entry of judgment by consent, was the Master correct in
rejecting it? And is New Hampshire's present position in
support of the. Master correct?
We believe the Master gave sound reasons, sound and
adequate reasons, for recommending rejection of the consent
decree, and we have not taken any exception to this ruling.
The motion for entry of judgment by consent —• and I took part
in it —- was an effort by the two States to get a compromise
settlement — frankly, a compromise settlement

approved.

It had to become a judgment of this Court or it would dc us no
good because our State had already unilaterally adopted a
boundary line inconsistent with anything Maine would agree to
and our legislature had provided this shall be the line
■governing all public offices of New Hampshire unless and until
modified by a compact or by judgment of the United States
Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Was'that just a resolution by your

28
legislature, or was it approved by the Governor?
MR, UPTON:

That, your Honor, was a law which passed

and was approved by the Governor, the one I just quoted, and
that was passed before we entered into this corapremise agreement„
It was signed by the Governor.

It is quoted in the appendix

to our brief,
QUESTION:

That line want some 200 miles out to sea,

didn't it?
MR. UPTON:

That was the next section of that

chapter, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, then, when you entered into the

compromise agreement, I take .it that those who were acting on
behalf of the State of New Hampshire felt it was consistent
with that first act of the New Hampshire legislature?
MR. UPTON:

We felt that it could only be made

consistent, your Honor, if this Court approved it and adopted
it and made it a judgment of this Court.

In that case it

came, within the exception of the statute.
QUESTION:

And, of course, you don't know whether

this Court will approve it or adopt it until you have submitted
it to the Master and he in turn has submitted it to the Court
and this Court has decided one way or the other, I suppose.
MR. UPTON:

That is correct., your Honor.

The

matter rests in the hands of this Court at this moment, because
you do have the power, I believe, if you find that is the law,

29
to enter the consent decree»
QUESTION:

Well, in a sense, it is like a stipulation

where you settle a personal injury claim or

something; two

lawyers get together' and agree and they have to submit it to
the court, so the matter remains open until the judge actually
approves the stipulation»
MR» UPTON;

Thai::s true»

Although in the case of

a personal injury case, your Honor, the partias have the power
to make such a settlement without the intervention of the
court,

They could just
QUESTION:
MR, UPTON;

The injured party
In that case I have to confess it

requires the approval of the court»
QUESTION;

That is the sort of thing I think my

brother Rehnquist suggests.

There is a public interest.

Of

course, we have had this problem.
MR. UPTON:

This problem always exists, and I suppose

it exists in a criminal case where a man pleads guilty and
counsel attempted to work out an arrangement as to what the
recommendations will be for sentence.

It’s placed before the

court, and the court may or may not accept it and may impose
a harsher penalty or a lesser penalty.

But the matter is in

the hands of the court.
QUESTION:

Isn8t there some contract law theory that

would say neither party has the right, to repudiate it durxng the

30
reasonable time that it has taken to go through the steps
necessary for judicial approval?
MR. UPTON:

,

Your Honor

I take this to be the

position regarding contracts, that if this is not to become a
judgment of this Court, then it must be a compact which requires
the consent of the United States Congress in order to be
binding on the States, because this Court has several times
held that the resolution of boundary disputes between States
falls within the compact clause if the, case is not settled
by a judgment of this Court.

That would be my answer.

Now, this was frankly a compromise on which we needed
the Court's approval, but at the time we did this we were
unaware of what your Honors were going to hold in New York v.
Vermont
the

or Vermont v. New York, and that decision came down, in

summer of the time these negotiations were going on.

Now, we compromised in these ways:
geographical middle.

The thalweg versus the

New Hampshire accepted the thalweg and

then we further compromised on the thalweg by deciding w®

would

agree it is a straight line when in fact, of course,- it can't
be physically.

But for convenience, for the convenience of

law enforcement, we agreed that it was the thalweg and that
that was it.
Secondly, the mouth of the harbor, for determining
the point where the thalweg ended, we agreed was the line
going from Odiornes Point to a submerged rock called Kitts Rock

31
which has a whistling buoy on it.

Wow, this, again, was an

arbitrary compromise for administrative convenience, but it
has no relation to law, the law that applies to tell where
a harbor's mouth is.
And, finally, we agreed that the line across the
open sea would be a straight line rather than a curved line
as sought by Mains based on the United States Geological
Survey maps, and here the Master has found that we adopted
correct law.

The straight line is proper under the special

circumstances exception of the Geneva Convention.
Wow, when the terms of this settlement were proposed
to the Master, ha told us he now doubted that he had the power
to accept it, although he had earlier urged us to try to
settle.
QUESTION;

That is because of the intervening

decision of Vermont v. New York.
MR. UPTON;
on that.

Yes, your Honor.

And we held, a hearing

It appeared .likely that he might rule to accept it,

he might accept it with modifications; he might reject it and •
call for an evidentiary hearing in full; or he might proceed
to decide the case either for New Hampshire or for Maine on
the record we made for him, because when we knew about
Vermont v. New York we tried to repair the situation by
presenting the Master with a stipulation for an. evidentiary
record which

is

reported in full on pages 2 and 3 of the

32

record, so he would have something by which, to judge the
lawfulness and: reasonableness of the stipulation.
Now, he recommended rejection.

He thought we were

presenting him with a fait accompli which he would merely
rubber stamp and which did not call for the exercise of the
judicial power, that is, applying established principles of
i

lav; to facts which either have been stipulated to or settled
by 'the evidence.
tiling.

He felt that this wasn’t that kind of a

He had been presented with something that wasn’t

judicial in nature and not a proper basis for a judgment.
He then found that the record we had stipulated to
before him as a basis for deciding the care was sufficient
for him to make a decision on the merits without further
hearing, and he then proceeded to decide, as my brother Bradley
has outlined in his opening statement.
Novr. ve believe that the Faster was correct in
adopting geographic middle as opposed to thalweg. We compromised
that position in the beginning in order to obtain what we
thought was doubtful, that is, a straight line across the
open sea which we felt was very important to as,
QUESTION; Mr. Upton, looking at tic consent decree
lines, so-called, which appears in the appendix to the response
of the State of Maine to New Hampshire’s exceptions, what
accounts for that line CEF?

If you have that little tan brief.

What accounts for th* segment of the line CE?

Why wasn’t it

33
drawn from C, which is the* thalweg middle?
MR. UPTON;

What was the F?

S. your Honor, was the point we agreed

on in the consent decree as being the mouth of the harbor and
the and of the thalweg.
QUESTION;
ME. UPTON;

Than what is C doing there?
C is the line ™- I believe my brother

means that C is the line drawn by the Master, C to D.
QUESTION 3

Yes, but if you look at the key to the

appendix in the upper left-hand corner, the consent decree
line is. denominated as CEF»
ME. UPTON:
QUESTION;
MR. UPTON;

That.0s right, your Honor.

The reason we

Not just CF.
CD is the line found by the Master.

CEF is the consent decree, and w@ extended the thalweg out to
S, which is a point we agreed in our stipulation to be the
mouth of the harbor.
QUESTION s

So than w© took off across the sea.
I see.

So that E is the thalweg as far

as it goes out into open sea.
MR. UPTON:

Yes, sir.

And we stipulated that would

be the mouth of the? harbor by arbitrarily drawing a line from
Odiorne Point across to Kitts Rock whistling buoy at that
location.
QUESTION:

All right.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

For purposes or enforcement, Mr. Upton,

how would these areas bu identified under the consent decree?

/

34

MR. UPTON:

As we go off to sea — and this is where

• the biggest, trouble of enforcement is, your Honor — we would
ask Maine to participate with us in. putting range lights on
Newcastle Island, one behind the others, lined up with this
line, and we have asked the Court -- and Justice Clark
recommended to the Court ■— that

a

commissioner be appointed

to mark the line when the report, becomes final.
done in most of the boundary cases.

has

This has been

It "was done in Vermont v.

Hew Hampshire,; after the Court had adopted the law and decided
how it applied, a commissioner was appointed to mark points
on land where the agreement states.

And w® think this

would be appropriate here.
QUESTIONs

His function would have some finite limits

in the sense that when he finished marking, that would be the
end of his job.
MR. UPTON;
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.
It didn't require any ongoing judicial

supervision.
MR. UPTON:
as I see it.

He would have hardly any discretion

I agree with your Honor3s suggestion.

QUESTION:

But from the point of view of the lobster

fishermen, there would be range lights
MR. UPTON i

that they could —

They would have much' the same effect as

the lights on rang© that the lobstermen fought so hard to have,
that is, two lighthouses, on© behind the other.

35

QUESTION?- Those are existing lighthouses, they .go
way back.
MR. UPTON;
QUESTION:

They go way back in history.
And the claim is that as a matter of

practice, that's bean the practically recognized boundary over
the years.
MR. UPTON:

That's what the claim is.

So we entered, into the compromise realising that
it would have to be approved.

We had Vermont v. New York?

we had the stipulated record, and we had the Master moving
that it be rejected, and we had detailed findings by him -that
it was the geographic middle rather than the thalweg.

And w@

support that ruling because in reviewing the record of the
Boundary Commission, we find that when they referred to the
Merrimack River on th® south, they always used the words
"middle of the channel,” whereas when they referred to the
Piseataqua River on th® north, they used "middle of the river.'5
And New Hampshire's Commissioners talked about losing half
tie river to Maine, then Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts
Commissioners said the line has always been in th© middle of
the river because those- islands nearest to each State have
always been taxed by each Stats, and we say that language
speaks in terms of geographic middle? just as in th® case of
iras v. Louisiana where your Honors felt, that the intent of
Congress was directed to the middle of th® river, geographic

36
middle rather than the thalweg.

And we feel this case is

equally strong.
Thalweg was not in vogue as a tool of interpretation
in 1740.

Also, we were then under British colonial rule

where there was freedom of navigation to all British subjects,
including colonists.

There was no obstruction to freedom

of navigation, which is on© of the things 'that makes thalweg
applicable.
I have not; touched on the Mlights on range*9 argument
of the amicub curiae because there is no exception before the
Court raising that question.

But if the Court is interest®!

in considering it, there is an apt quotation in United States v.
Louisiana, 394 U.S. at page 76. "The unauthorized acts
of private citizens could generally not support a claim of
historic title."
So in conclusion w© submit, that the Master ‘ s report
should be confirmed with the exception that the Court should
hold it was error to use these low-tide elevations.
QUESTION;

What precisely,if we war® to agree with

you, would that mean in respect to relocating the geographic
middle?
MR. UPTON:

I believe that on that issue the case

should ba referred back for findings.
QUESTION:

How do you think it would affect it?

How about, for example, the center point of the mouth of the

37

harbor, where would it move to?

How far would it move, do you

know?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Bradley* you have

about 9 minutes left* if you need it.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD F. BRADLEY* JR,
ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT
MR. BRADLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice* I would like to

refer briefly to the questions that were raised with respect
to whether a factual determination is required in determining
whether these low-tide elevations the Special Master used
qualified for the tests under the Geneva Convention.
The arguments that my brother Upton has mad© that
this i3 not ar island* a low-tide elevation within the meaning
of island* part of the mainland.

These kinds of questions have

given rise to.substantial evidentiary hearings in oases in
Louisiana* an opportunity which the State of Maine nor the
State- of New Hampshire has had because of the way obis came up
to this Court,
This is a problem in another regard.

The Special

39
Master, w© beli^v©, has seriously prejudiced a right of the
State of Maine that exists outside the issues in this dispute.
Thus the Master found it was essential to determine where the
location of inland waters was, because he felt this Court in
U.S. v. Maine had determined that there was no ownership in
the intervening area between Gosport Harbor and Piscataqua.
But w® believe that this is inconsistent with the reservation
of jurisdiction which this Court has exercised at 421 U.S, 958
in granting the motion of the United States Government to
reserve its jurisdiction to determine questions just in this
nature.

The State of Maine has an historic inland water claim

and other coastline claims which would give it sovereignty
over the area between Piscataqua Harbor and Gosport Harbor,
and wa believe that we should have the opportunity to be
permitted to apply the criteria that the Court has announced
in dealing with similar claims in the States of Alaska, Florida,
and Louisiana in just last term.
The Master's determination has precluded us from
doing that, and we didn't even know he was doing it until the
report came out.

Wa didn’t,in choosing thalweg, in choosing

straight line portion, of the boundary, think 'that we needed to
determine the extent of inland waters, which is why the
questions which fch© Master has focused so strongly on with
respect to the location sr inland water and geographic middle
are almost irrelevant to the determinations that want into the

40

consent decree.
All w® needed to do was to decide, thalweg was

whether the line ended.
