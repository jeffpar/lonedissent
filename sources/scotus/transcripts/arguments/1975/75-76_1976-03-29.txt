ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. JANKLOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JANKLOW:

Mr. Chief Justic©, and members of the

Court:
This is the case of tha State of South Dakota v.
Opperiri an.

It comes here on a writ

of certi, orari to the

Supreme Court of the State ©f South Dakota.

Basically, what vm

have in this css© is a question of an inventory procedure of an
-u tea obi is; that was taken pursuant to lawful ordinance of tha
City of Vermillion1, South Dakota.

I think the facts arts par­

ticularly important with respect to this particular case.

They

are very brief.
In the early morning hours of December 10, 1973,
ihara was a car parked on the street in Vermillion, South
%

Dakota, which ia a small college town, the seat of the Univer­
sity of South Dakota.

The ordinances in the City of Vermillion

prohibit parking there from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. in tha morning.
This vehicle was parked there during that period of time, receivsd a -ticket from the police officer.

The next morning, it

was still there at approximately 10 a.m.

The mater maid, in

4
making her rounds, put a -ticket on the car, shortly thereafter,
when she completed her rounds, she reported it to the police
department, at. which time one of the police officers, officer
Frank, went over, looked at the car, examined the two tickets,
and had the car towed away to the impoundment lot in Vermillion.
Th© impoundment lot in Vermillion is an unguarded lot and, as
the record clearly establishes, they have had -trouble there
previously with respect to having cars broken into and vandal­
ised when they have been put in the impoundment lot.
As he looked through the window of the automobile,
the windows ware locked — I should say rolled up, and the doors
were locked, and as h© proceeded to look into the automobile,
he could see a wrist watch and other items on the back seat.
He had the tow truck operator open the door latch, and ha pro­
ceeded, pursuant to the standard procedure of the Vermillion
Police Department, with a standard procedural form to go
through and inventory the contents of the automobile for
valuables.

The standard inventory consisted of things such as

■fell® outside, the exterior condition of the car, the dashboard,
the seats, the floors, and things of that nature.
QUESTION:
distinction.

I notice how carefully you have drawn the

What is the difference between an inventory and a

search?
MR. JANKLOW:

I think in our brief we attempted to

draw a distinction between an inventory and a search, because,

5
frankly, w© no longer do that.

I don't draw that distinction.

I do draw a distinction in the word "search” between criminal
searching typ© conduct and normal inventorying type of thing,
but I will get into that, Hr. Justice Marshall.

But we don't

attempt at this point before the Court to say that an inventory
is not an intrusion, which is the Fourth Amendment type of
search situation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jffinklow, does the record show what the

police standard procedure is with respect to ascertaining the
ownership of the vehicle and where the owner might be?
MR. JANKLOW:

It does not, Your Honor.

office did not handle it, I don't know.

And sine© our

I only know what the

record shows, and the record does not show that.
QUESTION:

It is silent, for example, on whether there

was a license on th© car or anything like that?
MR. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

As far as I —

I haven't seen any, I just wanted you to

confirm that.
MR. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

I ~

Does the practice variate d@pand.ing on

whether or not the car doors ar© locked?
MR. JANKLOW:

It does not, Your Honor, because of the

fact that after — they have had several instances where th©
cars have be an vandalized.

Th© Vermillion Police Department is

a small police department in a college town.

The impoundment

6
lot is not secure or guarded at any time, and they have had
past instances of people breaking into cars.

So as a result

©f that particular procedure, they have started inventorying
cars for the valuable contents.
As a matter of fact, in oar particular cas©, the
respondent Opperman has never contested at any point in these
proceedings, including in the briefing stages before the
Supreme Court, that the police officer did not follow a proper
procedure and was doing nothing wrong in violation of any
amendment, including the Fourth Amendment, when ho entered the
locked cor to search for the — I shouldn't say to aearch, to
secure, retrieve and to put into safety the concents, the
watch and things of -that nature,

There has never been any

argument that the polio© officers have don® anything that was
sot in fact: correct.
So basically what we come down to is during the poirt
••:>£ the time that the officer was retrieving the items from inaide -the body of the car, he checked the glove compartment, he
opened the glove box, it was closed but it was not locked, said
opened it up.

in it h© found a checkbook, an installment loan

contract or installment loan papers, blank checks, some keys
and, for the purposes of this case, loss than an ounce of
marijuana.

All of these -~
QUESTION:

What is the practice, Mr* Janklow, dr..- they

tab© it out of the car then, these i tarns, or do they leave tbssi

7
ia?
MR. JANKLOW:

Ito, sir, they are taken out of the car

and they were in this case, all of these items, to the
Vermillion Police Department, after they ar® filled out on an
inventory sheet.

And at approximately 5. p.ra. of the same

af tar noon, Mr. Opperman, respondent Oppermaa cam.® to the
Vermillion Police Department, picked up his belongings, his
valuables, received them back with the exception of the
marijuana, where a warrant was served on him, a citation was
issued, and that brought about the reason for this case.
QUESTION:

Counsel, does the record tell us what, the

standard procedure would have been if there had not been a
valuable article such as the watch in plain view?
MR. JANKLOW:

My understanding, Mr. Justice Stevens,

is that all of th® cars that are impounded by the Vermillion
Police Department involve having the contents inventories for
•the protection of —
'QUESTION:

So you don’t rely particularly on the fact

that they saw the watch on the back seat or whatever it was?
MR. JANKLOWs
QUESTION:
'

I see.

MR. J&NKLOW:
QUESTION:

No.

I don’t.

I wanted to be sura.

MR. JANKLOW:

Th® reason for that, again, is I think

we are involved basically with three particular issues when w©

8

are talking about safety of property.

The first issue is the

safety of the individual who owns the car's property.
obviously left his watch on the dash.

Opperman

An argument 1 think

could fo© mad® that, by leaving his wrist watch on the dash, h©
could cars less whether or not somebody took his watch.

But ha

left it out on the main street of Vermillion, South Dakota,
where it is well lit, and it was moved to a different place
pursuant to legitimate or lawful police activity under the
ordinance of the City of Vermillion Polio© Department.
QUESTION:
trunk

What about the trunk, Hr. Janlow, was the

*
MR. JANKLOWs

The trunk was not searched in this

particu lar an toraobile.
QUESTION:

Th© practice of the police department does

not include opening the truck?
MR. JANKLOWs

It doss not.

I had to ask opposite

counsel, but it does not.
QUESTION;

Even if it war® unlocked?

MR. JANKLOWs
QUESTION:

Eves if it is locked, it does not

Even if it wore unlocked?

MR. JANKLOWs

If it ware unlocked, I can’t answer

that because I don’t know, sir.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, sine© I don't know,

how much is an ounce, is that enough for on© cigarette?
MR. JANKLOWs

No, a package of cigareetes weighs

9
approximately an ounce? and the standard I always get is you
could probably get about 20 joints from an ounce», is the
standard that 1 usually hear.
QUESTION;

Not -that it matters.

I was just wondering.

QUESTION;

For the purposes of this case, th® consti­

tutional issues ar© no different from what they would be. if it
were heroin or some other substance?
MR. JANKLOW:
QUESTION;

They ar© not? Your Honor.

Would you explain for me once again the

difference between going into th© glove compartment on the on®
hand or lifting the hood up on th® other?
MR. JANKLOW:

I frankly don't see any difference.

I

•think if I had to put them in orders of priority, one, glove
boxes have locks on therm.

When anybody ever breaks into a car ?

I can't imagine anybody breaking into a car to take anything
and not go into the glova box? because X think, as a matter of
common sense, wa realise that people always go into there,

tod

bacaus® Opparman concedes that w® could be in th® ear under
plain visa to secure tha watch, it was just a matter of checking
'the glova box, and it opened up and out cam© the contents.

I

think also frankly that with respect to tha trunk and under tha
hood, there are certain areas of this country, frankly, in our
a.hate, sets areas more than others, where things like car
hteries disappear quite oft
r-gines

I am not familiar that

cot of cars vary of inn when they are vandalised;.

10
but certainly car batteries do.

The same is tame with respect

to items in the trunk, spare tires and jacks and things of that
nature in variably come out of trunks.
The State of South Dakota is not contending that
everything that is there has a right to be go»,© through.

For

example, we are not arguing for a moment that we could go in­
side the wrist, watch just to look for things.

The respondent’s

brief raises questions about suitcases and things of that
nature, and citas the loss of suitcases, th® Lawson case, I
should say, from the Eighth Circuit, but we have got a differ­
ant situation there, because in th® Lawson case you are dealing
with a trunk that was entered,
was entered.

w® didn’t have any trunk that

We feel that the scop® of th® search or th© scop®

of the intrusion or whatever characterisation the activity
should be given, whatever terminology it should be given, is
one — •enough activity to, one, secure the item, and, two, to
a-u able ha reasonably identify it for th© purpose of safe­
keeping and inventory, and if that
QUESTION?

Mr. J&nklow, you have- stated that fcivn

purpose, the primary purpose in any ©vent of an inventory
search is to safeguard valuables.

Would you say that a second­

ary purpose of the search would be to discover evidence of
crime?
MR. JANKLOW:

No, sir, I would not, because there is

absolutely nothing in our record that would indicate that.

I am

11
not aware of any other ease in Vermillion that has arisen with
respect to the discovery of: anything for a crime.

I am

familiar with -the amicus brief that was filed for Americans
for Effective Law Enforcement, I believe is the nam® of the
organisation, and they cite statistics dealing with other arenas
of the country which show that in fact a very small portion of
the automobiles in those sample areas -that are inventoried in­
volve the recovery of any property that deals with criminal
activity, and, frankly, it would be the most unproductive, as­
suming that these statistics that have bean submitted are true,
it would be the most, unproductive type of police activity that
you could imagine, and it would certainly be wasteful in that
there are better things that police could do with, respect to
protection of the people and property in the community.

And

■ o for those reasons, we don't feel that that is a secondary
motive at all, Mr. Justice Powell.
W© think that on© of the key things that wa have hero
is that we eortainiy are not in tfea particular situation, like
;;c-ms of the. more large statas ars, the more populous states
are.

Where you take states such as New York, Illinois, Michigan

and places like that that have the larger police departments,
that have the facilities, impoundment, lots with high wire
fences around them, guards around them, and things of that
nature, and, you know, I don't know that we would be here if w®
war® representing one ©£ those states and faced with that

12
problem *

But we are d@ali.ug with Vermillion, South Dakota,

where, frankly, we don't have the resources.

I think it is

more than just the protectiori of the individual’s property -that
w@ ar© talking about when we talk about this inventorying
procedure, because w® have also got the protection of the law
enforcement officers.
Wow, (Mr Supreme Court attempted to minimize that
particular problem by stating that, because the individual had
•

)

left his ear and that it had lawfully com© into the custody of
the law enforcement community by reason of the fact that the
ordinance provided that it would be impounded, that it be taken
away for the improper parking, that th@ law enforcement com­
munity then at that point became a gratuitous bailee, and as s
raoult their liability, if any, was vary slight.

.

But I don’t

think that, frankly, the Fourth Amendment -- an interpretation,
of the Fourth Araesdmsnt is aver turned on what the financial
obligations are or responsibilities arc? of any of the particular;
parties involved in the proceeding.
And the on® additional thing which —
QUESTION:

Mr. Janklcw, I suppose, regardless of the

standard imposed by South Dakota as to what kind of a bailee,
you can still get into arguments about whether something was or
war not in fact in the glove compartment, if someone cores
along later and says it was stolen.
MR. JANKLOW:

I think that is correct, Mr. Justice

13
R@hnqui.st, except w© worked from the premise basically that all
people are honest.

Ws presuppose that -they are going to fa©

honest, and that if the first individual that has the interior
contact or the contact with the automobile inventory, it is &
question of that one person's word against anybody ©Ise’s one
•and two, you've got the situation where once the community
knows that impounded automobiles ar® inventories, it is cer­
tainly not going to make a lot of sense, one© the word is out,
for thvsm to go vandalising and breaking into cars any longer
that have no valuables in them, because they have been taken
out, so I think that there is a third category here of protec­
tion, and that is protection of people from not being encouraged,
especially young people, juveniles, to go and burglarize and
vandalise cars when fch©y realise there won't be any fruits
are.

And so I think we ar® not only talking about protection

of tha law enforcement community, we are also talking about
protectio:::, of tha individual whose got possession or originally
had possession of tha vehicle or at least whose property is in
tha vehicle, as wall as the general public.

So I think there

are three areas of protection that w© are dealing with with
respect to this particular case.
QUESTIONS

Does the record show when these standard

procedures ware adopted by the polio© department?
show som© vandalising.

It does

I just wondered if vandalizing was

before or after the standard procedures.

14
MR. JANKLOW:

It does not show that, Your Honor.

W© feel that, with respect to the Court5s decision in
Cady v. Dcrabrowski, that basically although it didn't come down
in exactly the same issue, it was awful close, that the
language of that could be controlling, could be governing.

The

parallels that could be drawn from a rural community in
Wisconsin with Vermillion, South Dakota are certainly there.
With respect to the activity of the law enforcement officers,
the parallel is there, other than the fact that in Dombrowski
they ware dealing with looking for a firearm for generally
either protection of the general public at large — we are
dealing with an automobile in both instances that lawfully cum©
into the control of the law enforcement community*

And I

think one of the most important things is there has never bean
.u allegation, at any time in our case, as the same is true in
Dombrowski, that the law enforcement officers were looking for,
c3 -3, any criminal avidsnce, that they were conducting any
criminal investigation, that they were involved in any way in
pursuing the criminal law.

No allegations have ever been made

thcit there was any attempt at subterfuge —* or I should say
that there was a subterfuge being used in this inventory process
to pursue the criminal law or any criminal prosecution.

As a

matter of fast, the record is clear, at least as far as the
trial transcript, is concerned — I believe the page number is 2V.,

15
where the law enforcement officer was asked — he said that
until he was in the process of doing this inventory and came
across th© items in the glove compartment , he had no reason to
suspect anything improper with respect to that particular motor
vehicle.
We think the key

there aren't a lot of cases in

this area, especially at th© Supreme Court level.

1 think the

Supreme Court’s cases of Cooper, Harris and Dombrowski are
basically the three key cases.
Dealing with th© Cooper case first, 1 should say,
then the Harris case, and then of most recent nature the case
of Dowbrowski in 1973.

Th© Preston case is discussed a lot i;>

all these various cases, but th® Preston case, we submit, is
not involved in our issue here, the 1964 Preston decision, for
th® reason that Preston dealt with an attempt by the state to
.'•ay that ?. car was takas pursuant to as arrest, pursuant to a
valid arrast, even though the search I should say was conducted
pursuant to a valid arrest, when in fact that was not the cass.
Individuals war® arrested for vagrancy there, and the issues,
the holding in Preston has bean on many occasions referred back

to as th® fact that it is confined specifically to th© facts
that you had io Preston, and that we don't have here with this
particular case at all.

Law enforcement officers were not £&

any legal custody of the Preston vehicle and, as a matter of
fact, they attempted in subsequent argument, ©r I should say in

16

further argument, to say that th© car might have been stolen,
and that is th® reason they were looking at it from that stand­
point.

So w© feel that the Preston case is not controlling.
There is an additional case, other than those that

have been'cited in the briefs.

Th® Fourth Circuit, I have bean

informed, has recently com© down with a decision dealing with
this particular fcyp© of Fourth Amendment question.
don't know the name of th® ce.se,

I frankly

I was only mad© aware of it

yesterday, and 1 don't have a copy ©f it.
QUESTION:

If you wish to draw attention to that,

send us a memorandum and send it to your friend.
MR. JANKLOW:

I certainly will.

I would like to re­

serve the additional time that I have, Mr. Chief Justice.

Turning to the factual situation that Mr. Janklow has

as presented and feel that it is imperative for proper

Ik th© record again be brought to your attention.
Those are that the record clearly shows that this
particular vehicle bore current South Dakota license plates at
the time that th© initial seizure from the, streets of Vermillion
occurred, and the record also clearly established th© fact that
the officer towing the vehicle or th® officer who had th®
vehicle towed made no attempt to contact th® owner, mad© no
attempt to ascertain who th© owner of th© vehicle was prior to

that I wish to make — and I feel that this particular fact

QUESTION:
MR. ULRICH:

Do you insist that that is in this case?
No, I don't insist that it be dona.

only wanted to bring it to th® attention for the Court's pur­
pose that if th© situation doss occur, where the owner is

QUESTION?

So you could keep it in your wallet then?
Yes* that is correct.

That’s correct.

if the owner is present, perhaps the best way t© handle this
protection of his privacy and the protection of his property
argument would b© to give him the preference.
QUESTION;

But going back to the situation as it was

here, an apparently an abandoned car ox* at least a ear left
long over time, do you say that they had no power to search the
car for whatever records or papers might indicate the identity
of the owner?
MR. ULRICH;
Justice.

Yes, that is ray position, Mr. Chief

The record also establishes in this case that the

identity of the owner was detected after the time of the seizure

automobile.

It was very easy for the Vermillion Police Depart-

ment to detect who th© owner of this automobile was.

MR. ULRICH;

By doing what?
Pardon?
By calling -They radioed the Stata Bureau of Motor

Vehicles, and it tak.es them about three minutes to determine
who the registered owner of that vehicle would be.
QUESTION;

But if they can find the ticket, the card,

the ownership card or the driver's license in the car, you say
they have no right to talcs that easier stop?

21
MR. ULRICH2

I am saylag they have a© right to take

that step, because they would have no expectation of finding
this particular document, in the automobile.

As Justice White suggested, that is where

you would find it in his car, and that is where you would find

MR. ULRICH:

Well, I think the batter argument would

be, rather than to break into the automobile with the use of a
tool,' and perhaps going one more step farther in this argument,
if the glove compartment is locked, also breaking into that
particular closed area, that it would b© much easier to pick up
the radio on the police unit and radio in to the department of
motor vehicles and have your answer back in three minutes.

sising that they had some kind of a duty to notify him that
they had towed his car away.

The normal procedure is, when your

car is gone, you call the police and the police say "Did you pay

23
your last installment?"

And you say yes, and they say, well,

w® will go look and am if we towed it.

Is that the usual

procedure in Vermillion?
MR. ULRICH :

Wall, ratiier --

QUESTION:

Is that 'the usual procedure there?

ME. ULRICH:
QUESTION:

I think it would be, yes.
Well, that is xfhat they war© doing,

MR. ULRICH:

I agree.

But for purpose of that argu­

ment or Idie addition of -that fact was only for the point, Mr.
Justice Marshall, to notify the Court that perhaps in further
situations if the individual is present, he should have been
given an opportunity or the choice, which particular means he
would wish to exercise to protect his proparty, and that is the
only limited purpose, again, for bringing that to the Court*s
attention.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ulrich, you keep referring to the de-

:ti rabiiity of giving him a choice if he had been present.
isn’t the typical situation

But

one in which the owner is not

present, and that is why the problem arises?
MR. ULRICH:
QUESTION:

Yes, I agree that it is.
Well, now, assuming ha is not present, what

exactly is the obligation of the police under your theory of
the case before they may make a thorough search of the car,
including the glov© compartment?
MR. ULRICH:

My position is the only way that they

24
could make a thorough search of the car, after the initial
seizure, would be to follow on© of the proscribed

exceptions,

automobile exceptions to the warrant requirement or a consent
search.

How, if the individual is present, if the police

officer did ask him what would b© your preference, and the
individual aons@nt.ed to the entry and seizure of ary items
within the automobile, that would b© the only two areas Where
my argument would allow police to enter and search.
QUESTION:

Assum® they are unable, by looking at the

license plates or seeing any other indicia of ownership in
plain view, assume they are unable to identify the owner.
Would you say that then it would be reasonable or unreasonable
to make a complete search of the car?
MR. ULRICH:

I think in this particular case it would

be unreasonable.
QUESTION:

So that if they get an abandoned car and

•they cannot identify the owner, you say the police may never
go into the private areas of the car?
MR. ULRICH:
alsment.

Mo, I think it would depend on a time

If no on® showed to claim feh© impounded automobile

within a reasonable time, 'that the police under somewhat of an
argument presented in the Cooper decision, time element or the
police war© allowed to search a car after they had custody of
it for on© week, this time element argument would then coma into
play.

It would give them, it would give the police department

25
some reasonable just if i catiori at that time perhaps to enter the
automobile and search it.
QUESTION;

Would you say th@ same thing if it was

apparent that the vehicle had been stolen and then abandoned on
the street —
MR. ULRICH;
QUESTION;
MR. ULRICH;

I think —
— that it still could not be searched?
I think in the stolen vehicle type argu­

ment, perhaps it could still not b© searched.

In those argu­

ments, the police are going to notify the owner of the recovery
of his automobile, he should then be given the preference
whether the automobile foa searched.

New, again, there are all

kinds of extensions in this area that would allow a search, but
I don't wish to comment on those.

QUESTION;

Basically, you are saying, I think, that

no search, if you know the owner, without first notifying fch©
owner?
MR. ULRICH;

Yes, I guess that is basically what my

argument is.
QUESTION;

Thar® is affirmative duty to contact the

owner?
MR. ULRICH;

Yes.

But pursuing the matter of the

cpr.is which have been referred to by the state in the matter,
the stats in thsir argument does place reliance.upon a decision
of this Court in Cady v. Dcmbr*woki.

interpretation of that case, and the proper interpretation of
that case would 3bs to examine the factual situation contained
in Cady, the factual situation where the individual was in­
toxicated , later unconscious and hospitalised, his automobile
in an accident, constituting a nuisance, the automobile being
impounded, the police officer impounding the vehicle, pursuant
to somewhat of a police regulation which would require them to
conduct an inventory — the record on that case, I am not quit©
familiar with what their regulations state, but the regulation
was present -- and the motive of the inventorying officer in
that case, which is absent in this case, was that he had a
reasonable belief that the vehicle contained a weapon which
would be dangerous either to himself or to members of the

reasonable grounds or probable cause existing to believe that,
this vehicle contained anything other than the items in plain

did not know whether the glove compartment contained any items
of value.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Ulrich, doesn't the notion of. proba.bla

a search with the object of taking incriminating evidence?

about probabia cause, to believe that there was a gun in the
trunk, when you are not talking at all in terras of pursuit of
crirainai evidence?

Don't you have to analyse it in soma other

terras of reasonableness?
MR. ULRICH;

I don't believe you would have to.

I

believe that the Fourth Amendment isn't only applicable in the
area of searches with the intent to seize criminal evidence,
but
QUESTION:

I wouldn't doubt that you are right.

All

I am suggesting is that perhaps the line of analysis should b®

correct?
MR. ULRICH:
QUESTION:

No, they did not.
Suppose they did enter the trunk and they

found inside the trunk some incriminating evidence, you say
that would similarly be subject to suppression and exclusion?
MR. ULRICH:

That would be my view.

29
QUESTION^

Suppos® when they opened the trunk they

found a small child;, bound and gagged, the victim of a kid­
napping, that fact would not be admissible in evidence then, if
h© is tried for kidnapping?
MR. ULRICH;

That would be my position, that avidenc®

would not be admissible.

It would b® entry into the closed

compartment of the vehicle without any justification, without
any basis of reasonablsnss, would offend Fourth .Amendment stand
ards.
QUESTION;

I suppose this hypo-fch@-5d.cal kidnap victim

It would give a reasonable foundation to

th© officer to believe that a vehicle did contain something
which should be removed immediately, and he would be justified.
QUESTION;

He would hav© a right to go in, in your

view then, to see whether it was just a hunting dog or & kidnap
victim?
MR. ULRICH;

Yes, in my view, -that would constitute

reasonableness under Fourth Amendment standards.

30
QUESTION:

But if they just stumbled on it by acci­

dent.» them they could not use 'that evidence against him?
MR. ULRICH:

Well, my answer to that question would

be yes, howaver, under fch© facts of this case, I don‘t feel that
they did stumble on evidence by accident.

I think it v?as by

design.
QUESTION:

What in the record do you suggest supports

that?
MR. ULRICH:

Just from the mere fact that the entry

was gained into an area of privacy with no foundation ©f reason
ableness.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no claim in this case that

it is like the Harris case, in that this was a plain view case.
There is no such claim at all, is there?
MR. ULRICH:

Wall, th© state seams to make that argu­

ment .
QUESTION:
MR. ULRICH:

That it is a plain view case?
No.

The state seems to make the argu­

ment that Harris is applicable hare.
QUESTION:
is one thing.

Well, Harris is a relevant decision, that

To say that is one thing, but I didn't under­

stand that there was any claim that this was in plain view be­
cause in fact it was in the glove compartment.

MR. ULRICH:■ No, this case is completely different
than Harris.

The language in Harris may b© helpful, but the

31
rule of law expounded by Harris, in ray opinion, is not applic­
able in this case, and I do share your opinion that Harris is a
plain view case.
QUEST3:ON2

Do you think the watch on the dashboard

being in plain view, supplied the element of reasonableness that
you mentioned?
MR. ULRICH:

I would like to answer that question.

Mr. Janklow's position was that Opperman did concede the
initial entry into this automobile.
position.

That has never been ray

That was the holding of the Supreme Court of South

Dakota that the initial smtry to remove articles in plain view
was reasonable. , My argument was that even the initial entry
of this automobile, where the windows were rolled up and tie
doors ware locked, • :::d th® ownar had taken all precautions that
he could to protect his items of value in the confines of his
automobile, that the, initial entry of breaking the close,
storing W a automobile was unreasonable.

That was my luiki

i

argument..
However-, this decision now, the decision of the
Supreme Court of South Dakota has modified that by its elects ion
of stating that they are not of the opinion that any seizure cf
items in plain view would be unreasonable.
QUESTION:

Suppose, instead of a wrist watch on the

dashboard there hid been a beautiful diamond broach, would that
have made any difference, would that have justified entry to

32
protect it?
MR. ULRICH;

I think perhaps the batter argument be­

tween the initial entry and the alternative argument of no
entry at all, I think the better argument is that that would
justify an entry into the automobile, only dealing with the
area ©£ plain view within the automobile, which .is an area —
which is an area in order to coma within th© automobile excep­
tion.
QUESTION;
MR. ULR3CH;
QUESTION;
MR. ULRICH;

A fortiori if it ware a gun in plain view?
Excuse me, Mr. Justice?
A fortiori if it were a gun in plain view?
Yes.

Yes.

Pursuant to the state’s additional argument, their
argument also runs? to the lower court’s decisions citing both

atat© and federal court decisions.

About half of the state

court decisions that th© government relies on in this cases did

not. analyse an inventory procedure to be a search.

Now, the

state has conceded this to b@ a. search for purposes of this
argument.
New, th® additional half of these cases proceed with
the analysis of reasonableness in light of the Fourth Amendment
The argument as to civil liability or the argument of bailments
in my opinion, is applicable in the analysis of reasonableness,
maybe not just for th© fact that it is there, but any analysis
of reasonableness has t© deal with motive, what, is the motive

33

in my opinion of the officer that is entering into the closed
confines of the automobile.
The state attempts to justify this entry in that the
officer's motive was to protect the police department.

Well,

in th© analysis of his motive, it is obvious that under th©
state laws of which he was operating, that h@ would not be
liable for ths entry to the automobile or he would not b®
liable for any articles within th© automobile that were in th©
absence of his plain view.
QUESTION:

The individual who was arrested was taken into th© station

Oar Supreme Court

stated that the officer was under no liability for any vandalism
that occurred to ths automobile on the open highway.
QUESTION:

An officer or & municipality might have to

go all the way to th© Supreme Court, as this case now demon­
strates, to get that, decided.

Don’t you think they have a

34
right to tak© sons® precautions and have procedures that will
protect them even against the likelihood of defending a suit?
MR. ULRICHs

This is a matter of statute also.

Cer­

tainly, there may b© some question as to statutory interpreta­
tion, but I think the statute in this case is quite clear•

m

South oakota, they are known or termed as gratuitous deposi­
tories , and they are only held to a slight standard or a slight
degree of care.

So I think that there may be a problem of

statutory interpretation, but I can find no slight or degree of
car© than rolling the windows and locking the doors on an auto­
mobile to protect any property in it, and in this case the
automobile was already locked.
QDESTICJJs

Mr. Ulrich, what if you win here and the

.South Dakate log is lature decides it doesn't like the result
:y much and so it passes a statute saying that policemen im­
pounding cars shall_ be subject to the highest degree of cars?
ought 'char ho change the result for Fourth Amendment purposes?
'* ULRICH:

No, I don't believe it should, but it

HiSiy go x.o an analysis of motive# what the officer8s motive was
wh®a he entered the automobile.

But in this case, the state

attempted to justify the entry as a police protection argu­
ment, that that was the motive of the officer, one of the
motives of the officer

entering the vehicle, to protect the

police department, and I don't see how that motive can be justif2.ad in light of the state statute only defining them as

35
gratuitous depositories and. slight degree of care.
QUESTION:

What else is there in the record to give

you motive?
MR. ULRICH;
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Justice?
What ©Is© is there in the record to give

you a contrary motive on behalf of the police?
MR. ULRICH:

There is nothing in the record to give

me a contrary motive.
QUESTION:

Than that means that the only thing that

will b© deterred, the only conduct that will ba deterred, if
the case were decided your way, would be inventorying contents
of cars ?
MR. ULRICH;

That would be correct.

Now

violations, but simply here -MR. ULRICH:

It would be deterring constitutional

QUESTION:

Well, that is the question in this case.

MR. ULRICH:
Mr. Justice Marshall as

Yes, but returning to the question of

to

is there anything in the record to

indicate any bad faith or any bad motive, I think an analysis
of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland on this issue in
their latest case involving an inventory procedure is htslpful.

36
The name of. the case is Dixor.- v. State.

The Justice writing

that opinion begins with the statement that nothing has
affected the yawning credibility gap between the officer's
testimony in the area of inventory searches since the Dropsey
case, and I think this is one of the dangers that are present
by allowing this type of procedure and allowing the officer to
testify that he had no bad motives, that it was strictly a good
faith effort.

1 don't think the constitutional —

QUESTIONs

Mr. Ulrich, to the extent that you rely on

the fact that police officers are possibly sometimes guilty of
not telling the truth, I suppose they are also on occasion
guilty of breaking into cars and stealing property of the
citizen who abandoned it there.

Is it a possible legitimate

interest to the state to regularize the procedure by which
thas® inventories are taken in order to minimize the danger of
theft by the police officers?
MR. ULRICH;

I don't know if I can answer that par­

ticular question as to regard to state policy.

I think that

the holding in this case by the State Supreme Court would cer­
tainly organise or stabilize these procedures.

It certainly

would give direction, this holding, and I think sine© this
holding has been expounded is?. South Dakota, that the standard
hau bean reached on the inventory searches after this holding.
So as -th© conclusion of this argument, ray position is
— and I feel that it would b® the bettor position — that in

37

the absence, af any re.asoaabIea.s3S, the 31try Into an area pro­
tected by the Fourth Amendment has to be found unreasonable,in
•violation of the Fourth Amendment.
The state's arguments as to the police protection and
the argument as to the protection of the owner of the property,
in my opinion, are without merit.

The owner is given no more

protection by having his inventory, the items in his automobile
inventoried-»

If aa individual is going to make false claim,

he is going to ba the type individual who is going to make them
■nnway, whether the items are inventoried or whether they are
not inventoried.
QUESTION*

If they are inventoried and carried to the

police and put in fchs police safe, they ar© a little bit safer
than sitting out there in the car, aren't they?

ULRICH:

I would say that just because an inven­

tory sheet is presented by a police officer, that that is not —
QUESTION:

No, this is more than an inventory sheet.

They took the materials and took them, to the polio© and put them
in a safe for keeping.
HR. ULRICH:

Those materials — yes, those materialia

would be safe.
QUESTIONt
MR. ULRICH:

Well, isn't that protection for the man?
Yes, that would be protection.

MR. CHIEF -JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Attorney General?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. JANKLOW, ESQ. -“REBUTTAL
MR. JANKLOWs

A couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice,

and members of the Court.
With respect to the respondent’s contention that ha
can compare this case with Cady, Opperman with Cady, the stata
will submit that that is their case also.

Cady was unconscious

and her© opperman wasn’t ever;, around.

Ha might wall have bean

unconscious because ft© wasn't, around.

From the 'time in the

ourly morning bxm::s xhxx 'hx. first discovered that his car
wouldn’t stcirt, according to the record, until labs the next
afternoon, ha never ‘bothered to call the police department,
which everybody concades is in a community of approximately
5,000 to 10,000 people, yet an argument is now mad© that thure
was some expectation; the police should go running around loot­
ing for him, when the obvious thing would hay© bean, had h©
cared, was to get a hold of the police department.
Second of all, in Cady there was a nuisance with the
car parked.

Her© there was a nuisance with the car parked.

39
There is a legitimate ordinance ~ there is no argument

but

that there :1s a legitimate ordinance that provides that cars
that break the lax# with respect to parking have to be removed
between 2 and 6 a.m.
With respect to the impoundment, in Cady a car was
impounded, in here the car was impounded.

In Cady, it. happened

to be seven miles from the police, station, cut in the rural
country of Wisconsin.

Here we happen to have had it taken in-

'3id© the community of Vermillion, but also not at the police
station and also in a place where it was unprotected.

In Cady,

they talked about motive, in liar© wa talk about motive.

In

Cady, the motive was to search for the weapon to protect th©
general public.

There was no argument but that what the police

in Cady ware doing was to look for the weapon, one, and, two,
thoir ocntacrk with th© car was a non-criminal contact because
the car was a nuisance and they legitimately had it.

Ecu:® in Opperraan, we have non-criminal contact.

There

was no suspicion and nobody has ever made the allegation that
there

v.t3

any colic© suspicion of any criminal violation,

fe'va

got the protection of the public, th© protection of th© police

officer, and. the protection of Mr. Opperman with respect to tbs
property —
QUESTION:

Should you b® able to look under the floor

mat, Mr. Attorney General?
MR. JANKLOWs

I would say yes, because I think anybody

40
frankly — people put their keys under the floor mat a lot of
times, that is wher© they place the ignition key.

Out in our

country, you look in the ashtray, over the visor, and under the
floor when you are looking for keys.

QUESTION:

But how about searching a locked trunk?

MR. JANKLOW:

We think that that would bs proper,

just because trunks are broken into just like glove boxes are
broken into.

This particular case we have here, Mr. Justice

Thite, respondent concades we are in the key and he would have
us just stop and look at the glove box and not even check to

sns if it ip open.

But we would submit that the. legitimate

ero&s ox ctsscara for th© protection on the balancing test,
under what is reasonable — and w© would submit that the reason­
ableness standard, the objective standard of Terry v. Ohio,

tln-.t was set. forth by the court in Terry v. Ohio, would c@rtai.nly foe Tbs on® shat would be applicable and could be applicable
with raspect to these inventory procedures, that the interior

of the car# the body of the-car# I should a&y# under the hood
and in the trunk.

That doesn't mean you tsar off the door

panels# it doesn't mean you tear the seats apart# it doesn't
mean you go up under and behind the dash# and those kinds of
things.
QUESTION?
MR

Under the seats?

JANKLOW:

QUESTION:

Looking under the seat# yes# sir.

What do you# break open the glove compart­

ment# if it. is locked?

MR. JANKLOW:

I would aay the answer to that would be

yes# just because a thief that would go in there would break
open the, glove box# but I would also submit that if that was
our facts# I would be in a completely different situation.

My

argument I think would be less tenuous # or I should say more?
tenuous than it is now.

But we submit that reasonableness is

■

42
But the key thing , I think the facts in oar cases are
unique and they lay us basically, other than for the gun
situation., they put squarely within the reasoning and til© logic
and the propositions that were laid forth with respect to
Dombrowski, also the arguments put forth of Cooper and Harris
clearly apply, that the automobile is of a different nature
than somebody's house•

It is mobile, but not only is it mobile,

but also because of -the police contact in a non-criminal nature,
that there is so much of.

This is the only reasonable thing

that these officers could have dona other than to just leave
the car in an area where they knew -that it was broken into in
the past and where it could b® broken into now, and then face
•the arguments, this whole argument about bailment, gratuitous
bailees.
:?rankly, although there is a statute on it in South
Dakota., it doesn't prrt&in to police officers.

It is a statuta

on gratuitous bailments, and it took our Supreme Court, to de­
cide that issue and oven, as respondent says in his argument,
even after this cass> there is another case before our Supreme
Court to decide whether or not a law enforcement officer was
a gratuitous bailee, and w© submit that the protection of
people’s property shouldn't, dap and on whether or not people aregratuitous bailees or not.

And for those .reasons, w© would

request that the decision of th© South Dakota Supreme Court be

reversed.
