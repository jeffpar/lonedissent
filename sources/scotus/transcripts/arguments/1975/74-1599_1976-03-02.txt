Mr. Selig, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL L. SELIG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SELIG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it Please the Court;
Prior to 1972, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act did not apply to the Federal Government.

In 1972, Title VII

was amended so as to make unlawful, under Title VII,
discrimination by federal agencies and departments.
The 1972 amendments also provided to federal
employees and applicants for employment a right to file a
civil action in a United States District Court.
The question in this case is, what is the nature
and the scope of that civil action?

The Commissioner contends

that it is a plenary judicial proceeding and the Respondents
contend that it is a review of the administrative record
pursuant to a substantial evidence standard.
Petitioner is a black female employee of.the
Veterans Administration.

In 1972, she applied for a GS-13

supervisory claims examiner position.

She was designated as

highly qualified for the position but a Filipino-American male
was selected.

She thereupon filed a complaint alleging that

4

she had been discriminated against on the basis of her race
and sex.
An investigation was conducted and after the
investigation, Petitioner was offered the option of either
receiving a final agency decision on the basis of the
investigative file without an administrative evidentiary
hearing or the option of receiving a final agency decision
after an administrative evidentiary hearing.
She selected the second option.
not an attorney.

Petitioner is

She represented herself at the hearings.

She requested that 24 witnesses be called to testify and the
examiner declined to call 15 of the 2 4 witnesses requested.
Nevertheless, the examiner found partially in
Petitioner's favor.

She found that Petitioner had been

discriminated against on the basis of her sex but had not been
discriminated against on the basis of her race.
The examiner recommended that Petitioner be
promoted immediately and retroactively to the. posit-ion in
question.
The examiner’s findings, however, are only
recommendations to the head of the agency or his designee and
the Veterans Administration accepted the examiner's finding
that there had been no race discrimination but rejected the
♦finding that there had been sex discrimination.
> etitioner at that point had the option of filing

suit in district court or appealing to the Civil Service
Commission.

She chose tine second ontion.

Commission affirmed the agency's decision.

The Civil Service
This suit followed.

In the district court, Petitioner sought discovery.
She sought initially to take two depositions and she requested
production of documents in these depositions.
The district court, however, granted summary
judgment on the basis of the administrative record in favor of
the defendants with no discovery and the Ninth Circuit
a ffirmed.
The positions --- the issue in this case is sharply
drawn and the positions of the parties are in stark conflict.
I think that the issue can be stated in terms of two inter­
related questions, one, who is the finder of fact in
of case?

this kind

Is it the court or is it the agency?
And, secondly, what evidence may be considered by

the court?

May the court consider all relevant evidence or

is the court limited to considering the evidence contained in
the administrative records?
QUESTION:

Do you admit of the possibility that

tiie mode of trial in the district court might be one way had
there been no appeal to the Civil Service Commission but in
another way if, as in this case, there was?
I suppose you, representing the client you do,
would not admit, of any possibility of that because your client

6

dirl take an appeal to the Civil Service Commission.
'IP. 3ELIO:

Well, that is correct, your Honor, ana

the statute specifically contemplates that suit may be filed
in either situation and makes no distinction as to —
QUESTION:

I know that, but suit may be filed

within thirty days after the final agency decision, as I
understand it.
HR. 3ELI0:
QUESTIO!!:

That's right.
Or

within 15 days after the final

agency decision and appeal may be taken to the Civil Service
Commission and then there in 180 davs further.

I know the

option.
My

question was, do you

— and I probably know

your answer because I realize the position that your client is
in but it just occurred to me that the answer might be — the
mode of trial miorht be in one way where there was no appeal
to the Civil Service Commission and in one way where there was.
MR. SELIG:

Well, of course, I would also point

out that the only thina added by the appeal to the Civil
Service Commission

is a further — is a review of the record

by the Civil Service Commission.

There is no additional

opportunity — there is an opportunity to make written
representations to the Commission but —
QUESTION:

It is the same kind of an appeal as it

is in an appellate court, generally.

7
MR. SELIG:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
I mean, it is an appeal on the record,

right?
MR. SELIG:

That is correct.

Petitioner's position on these two interrelated
issues is that the court is the finder of fact and that the
Plaintiff should be permitted to discover and introduce all
relevant evidence pursuant to the standards of the federal
rules of civil procedure as applied in all other Title VII
cases.
If the Court adopts our theory, plaintiffs in
federal sector cases would have no more procedural rights in
district courts than plaintiffs in any other Title VII cases
and they would have no less rights in district courts than
all other plaintiffs.
QUESTION:

What would be the rule as to the

admissibility of the administrative

record under your theory,

Mr. Selig?
MR. SELIG.

It is our assumption — in the first

place, let me say that normally there is no objection by anyone
to admission of the administrative record, but we believe that
the administrative decision is clearly admissible.
no question about that.
£ business record.
QUESTION:

There can be

It is also our assumption that —

necessarily follows.

If your theory is, this is a de novo trial,

presumably those issues of fact axe for the court or the jury
and ordinarily you can't admit a business record to prove a
fact that is ultimately within the jury's competence.
MR. SELIG:

It is our position that, certainly, the

agency decision and the Civil Service Commission is admissible.
QUESTION:

Well, on what theory, if it is really a

de novo trial, starting all over again?
MR. SELIG:

It is — I think the findings of

agencies are normally admissible whether or not the judicial
proceeding is a de novo proceeding.
QUESTION:

Well, aren't you

MR. SELIG:

And it is also in this record.

QUESTION:

--- aren't you suggesting a mixed

procedure, partly agency review and partly trial de novo?
MR. SELIG:

No, your Honor, it doesn't follow

from the fact -QUESTION:

What weight would the administrative

What construction?

MR. SELIG:

It would depend entirely on the nature

of the questions evolved in the case and what is contained in
the administrative record and the administrative decision but —
QUESTION:

Well, what would the judge charge the

jury as to the weight to be given?
■ iu. oxLi.tj:

Well, there is not a jury trial.

9
'QUESTION:

Okay, well, what does the judge, what

rule does he follow as to the weight that should be given it?
MR. SELIG:

’Nell, this Court, in Alexander against

Gardner-Denver Company addressed that question in a footnote
and said, we adopt no rule.

It depends upon the facts and

circumstances of the particular case and I would think that the.
same applies here, but the important thing about the footnote
in Alexander is that it says that the administrative decision
is admissible.

It may be accorded some weight but that refers

to its weight as one piece of evidence along with any other
evidence that is admitted.
QUESTION:

But that was a contractual grievance

proceeding, wasn't it?
MR. SELIG:

That is correct, your Honor and I'd

like to respond to that but I would like to finish what I was
saying about the footnote, which is that the record is
admissible.

It is entitled to whatever weight makes sense in

the particular circumstances but that doesn't mean that it may
be used as a reason for excluding other eyidence and the Court
goes on in the footnote in Alexander to say that it is the
duty of the courts to assure the full availability of the
judicial forum.
Now, the arbitration process is not a statutory
proceeding under Title VII,

However, in Alexander, the Court

also considered and rejected a proposed rule of deferral to

10

arbitrarial decisions which the Fifth Circuit had adopted in
a case called Rios against Reynolds Metal Company and the
conditions which the Fifth Circuit set for deferral were f one,
that the contractual right must coincide with rights under
Title VII, two, and I — well, I won't <70 into them unless the
Court wishes, but there were a number of conditions which
would have to be satisfied under the Rios test for deferring
to an arbitrarial decision and the very first condition was
that the arbitrarial, the rights under the contract must be
congruent with Title VII and the Court held in Alexander that
even if that were so, deferral would be inappropriate and there
should be a trial de novo.
Now, the government position is explicitly that
the agency is the finder of fact in these matters, subject
to substantial evidence review in the courts and that the
court should normally defer to the findings and decision of
the agency.
Furthermore, the government's position is that in
the ordinary case there is no discovery in the district court
and the record before the reviewing court must be limited to
the record made by the defendant agency.
Under this rule, the Federal Government would be
placed in a class all by itself exempt from plenary judicial
scrutiny.
Ne think that it is important to understand what

11
review on the record pursuant to substantial evidence test
means and Professor Jaffa has explained it as follows:
Under the substantial evidence test, the court will
be required to sustain a finding which it believes to be
incorrect and even against the weight of evidence because
it is the agency and not the court which finds the facts.
So long as there is substantial evidence in the
record taken as a whole that could support the agency's decision,,
the court must accept that decision even if it would believe it
to be wrong, making an independent judgment.

We think that

such a posture by a district court in a federal sector Title VII
case would be wholly inconsistent with the court’s function as
the finder of fact, and as the decider of what relief should be
provided.

Now, I'd like to address -QUESTION;

Now, that statement assumes the

conclusion, does it not?

You say as the finder of facts, the

whole issue in this case is whether the court or the agency
administrative tribunal is the finder of facts.
MR, SELIG:

That is right, Mr. Chief Justice and

I was just trying to point out that the government's rule would
be completely inconsistent with what the rule is in the private
sector and in the state and local sector under the decisions
of the court.
QUESTION;

But this is true in a great many other

areas, is it not, in judicial review of administrative action?

12
MR. SELIG:

Tht is correct, but I think that we

have to look at this particular statute, its particular
language, its particular legislative history and its particular
purpose and certainly we would not deny that review on the
record is the rule in large numbers of cases and Congress could
have provided for that if it had wanted to do so and in that
regard it is particularly significant that the draft legislation
which would have provided cease and desist authority to the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the private sector
would have explicitly provided for review on the record in
the courts of appeals pursuant to a substantial evidence stan-*
dard.

This was written into the draft legislation.
QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:
QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:

defeated.

That was when?

In '65 or '72?

No, your Honor.
In '72.
In '12, that is correct.

And that was

Congress knew how to provide for review on the

record if it wanted to do so,
QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:
QUESTION:

But that was -But they chose not to do so.
Has that proposed provisional as appli­

cable to federal employees only?
MR. SELIG:

Or across the boards.

No, and that is a second point in our

favor, Mr. Justice Stewart, which is that even that draft
leaislation did not apply to the federal sector otnd federal

13
sector cases were governed by a completely different section of
the draft legislation.
Now, I think it is important to consider one of the
arguments which was made in favor of cease and desist and
court of appeals review in the private sector and that argument
was that it would be too much of a burden on the district
courts to try all these cases de novo;
There was repeated reference to the problem of
congestion in the dockets of the lower courts and a repeatedlyexpressed reason in favor of agency enforcement rather than
court enforcement in the private sector was that this would
relieve the burden upon the district courts.
That argument may have been valid but it was
rejected by the Congress and I think that that has special
significance here.
In that regard, this is why we believe that the
comments of Senator Domenick have special significance here .
There would be no 1972 amendments without Senator Domenick
because cloture could not have been obtained unless the Congress
had agreed to Senator ’Domenick's amendment which would have and
did substitute court enforcement in the private sector for
cease and desist enforcement in the private sector and Senator
Domenick repeatedly expressed his concern that all parties,
plaintiffs and defendantst in private industry, in state and
Local governments and in the Federal Government, should have

14

their claims adjudicated Pursuant to the same procedures and
by the same fact-finders.

That is, by an independent United

States District Judge who would independently determine the
merits of their case.
QUESTION:

What was the occasion for providing

an elaborate administrative remedy for federal employees?
MR. SELIG:

It already existed, Mr. Justice White,

in substantially the same form —
QUESTION:

That may be so but in saying that you

provide the same remedies, well, that just isn’t true if there
is an elaborate

administrative remedy available.

MR. SELIG:

Well, they were referring to providing

the same remedies in court and I'd also like —
QUESTION:

I thought that was what you would say,

but nevertheless, the federal employee does have different
remedies.
MR. SELIG:

Well, it has different remedies with

respect to federal agencies.

I would also point out,

Mr. Justice White -QUESTION:

Well, he does have different remedies.

He has an additional remedy.
MR. SELIG:

It isn't the same at all.

Well, private sector employees and

state and local employees frequently have remedies at the state
and local level pursuant to state fair employment practices
statutes.

For example, in Minnesota and Michigan, for example,

15
and many other states you have a local fair employment practice
agency which has cease and desist authority over the private
sector and over state and local employees which provides trialtype adversary hearings with discovery and compulsory process
and private-sector employees are required to exhaust those
procedures before they can even complain to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII.
There may be many employees in that situation who
have a full trial-type adversary hearing at the state or local
level before they come into federal court.
QUESTION:

Aside from Title VII cases, what

happens to a federal employee who is discharged and utilizes
fully the administrative processes available to him?

What

happens to him with respect to court review?
MR. SELIG:

You mean under other bases or juris­

dictions, your Honor?
QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:

Yes.
He gets review on the record at the

court’s --QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:

Where?
Well, there has traditionally been a

remedy in the district courts but the courts are divided as to
vrhat the basis for that remedy is.

They are divided also with

respect to what standard of review is applicable.
QUESTION:

Congress has never sent federal employees

16

to the courts of appeals after Civil Service
MR. SELIG:

action.

Not to ray knowledge and the D. C.

Circuit has criticized that on numerous occasions.
QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:
QUESTION:

Yes, but the fact remains, they haven't.
No, that is correct, your Honor.
It is a review on the record in the

district court, is it not?
MR. SELIG:

That is correct.

But the whole point

is, I believe, that this apparently existed prior to the 1972
amendment and it did not exist under this statute and the
question is, what are the procedures to be followed under
this statute?
QUESTION:
giving

Wasn't a good deal of the opposition to

the EEOC cease and desist orders from private

employers who felt that it might give then less than a fair
shake?

Wasn't that most Senator D©m@nick’s position?
MR. SELIG:

Well, I think that was a substantial

part of his position.
QUESTION:

And that same argument certainly wouldn't

apply from the point of view of the Federal Government fearing
that the Civil Service Commission wouldn't give it a fair shake.
MR. SELIG:
from

No, but it would apply with respect

the point of view of the federal employee and applicant

for employment and that concern was repeatedly expressed.
I think I'd like to reserve the remainder of my

17
time at this point.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Lee.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Taken in isolation, the language of the statute and
its legislative history would support a respectable argument
for either record review or de novo trial.
For reasons that are set forth in our brief, we
believe the more persuasive view of the legislative history is
that it supports the record

review interpretation but the

most persuasive insight in the Congressional intent is provided
by the fact that beyond any dispute, Congress intended to vest
and did vest the frontline responsibility for insuring equal
employment opportunity in the federal sector in the Civil
Service Commission.
QUESTION:

And yet it is very clear that an employee

claiming discrimination can wholly avoid such review and go
into the federal district court after his agency has acted.
Isn't that right?
MR. LEE:

It depends, Mr. Justice Stewart, on how

broadly you consider the Civil Service Commission and its
responsibility in this area.

It is true that up to the point of

18

appeal to the appeals review board of the Civil Service
Commission, that it is a shared responsibility between Civil
Service Commission and agency.
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

And agency.
But everything that that agency does from

the beginning of the conciliation process through the investi­
gation, through the attempt at adjustment of the complaint and
including the hearing itself is conducted pursuant to Civil
Service Commission regulations according to procedures that
have been prescribed by the Civil Service Commission and at the
time that you get to the hearing — and there is no way that
you can skip that and go into court —
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

That is, the hearing.
Unless the complainant waives it but at

the time that you go to the hearing -QUESTION:

In your agency.

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

That is the only place

there is the hearing, in the agency.
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

Right.
That hearing is conducted, is presided

over by a full-time Civil Service Commission examiner certified
and trained by the Civil Service Commission.

When I talk about the Civil Service

this is the thrust of our position, we are

really talking about a shared agency responsibility,. Civil

But there is no question that

the entire procedure is consucted under the aegis of the Civil

overall supervision and control.

regulations.

That is what I thought.
— pursuant to Civil Service Commission

It is further significant that whereas we are

concerned today with the adjudication of a particular complaint,
this adjudication process is a part — an integral part of a
much larger whole equal opportunity effort by the Federal
Government.

It is all subject the direction of ■— it is under

a single office under a single director and additional
component parts of this overall effort are in addition to the
adjudication process.
There is a continuing process carx*ied out by the

20
Bureau of Personnel and Management Evaluation which evaluates
programs on a continuing basis.
In addition, the statute charges the Civil Service
Commission with the review and approval of equal employment
opportunity plans on a regional and nattional level and,
finally, the Civil Service Commission is charged with training
and upward mobility, affirmative action programs throughout
the entire Federal Government so that the federal judge, when
he considers a particular equal employment opportunity case,
gets the picture that is presented by that case.
The Civil Service Commission, by contrast, has the
adjudication process as a component part of a much broader
overall program and this was the thrust of Judge Gezell’s
opinion in Hackley versus Johnson.

He made the very significant

observation, which is true, that it is almost impossible in the
usual case, federal case, to differentiate between the claims of
pure discrimination on the one hand and the related problems,
necessarily-related problems of promotion, hiring, training
and general affirmative action in — no, promotion, hiring and
training and the great majority of the cases are promotion
cases.
Judge Gezell's conclusion, in a single statement,
in a. single sentence, which I quote is, that "The * Commission' s
growing expertise in civil rights matters, coupled with its
preeminent expertise in the latter areas, emphasizes that an

21
automatic trial de novo will not serve the laudable purpose of
the act.
It is further instructive to note, as was pointed
out by Mr. Justice White, that regardless of how you decide
this case, the government is going to be in a class by itself.
Congress simply

did not go the same route with

regard to the private sector and the federal sector.
QUESTION:

Arp there any even conceivable conditions

under which a federal employee could go to the EEOC?

There

are not, are there?
MR. LEE:

No, there are not.

They just don't have

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

That’s what I thought.
That is right.

That was, I guess next to

the question of cease and desist authority, that was the
biggest debate in Congress and the contrast is remarkable.
This EEOC simply does not have substantive remedial authority.
It lost that one in Congress and as a consequence, the limit of
what they can do is conciliation and persuasion.

That is

really the first step in the federal sector.
The federal employee, by contrast, has really two
points, arguably three, at which he can win and win affirmative­
ly and have the kind of back pay reinstatement, promotion,
whatever, prior to the time that he ever gets into court so the
concept of equality is not a relevant one.

That is a matter

22

that is simply precluded because of the structure of the act
as set out by Congress„
QUESTION:

Will you review those stepsf Mr. Lee?

The employees options, first within the agency, briefly.
MR. LEE:

I'd be happy to, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first step is that he complains of an act of
discrimination.

At that point, a counselor is appointed, an

equal employment opportunity counselor is appointed -—
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

Within the agency.
Within the agency.

That is correct.

And

he attempts at that point, at the very most informal level, to
achieve some kind of an agreement, to find out what it is that
has happened and to see if he can't work it out at that level
and a large percentage of them are worked out at that level.
If, within 21 days that has not been done, then the
aggrieved employee files a formal complaint and at that point
there is an investigator who is appointed to make an
investigation.

The investigator comes from within the agency,

but he cannot he under the supervision of the person who is
alleged to have discriminated.
The investigation is really the heart, initially,
of the inquiry into discrimination.
ask questions, to interview.

He has full authority to

It is not an adversary process.

It is an inquisitorial process.

And he prepares an investi­

gation file which is a report of what he has found.

23

The next step is that an attempt at adjustment of
the complaint is attempted on the basis of that investigation.
In the event that an adjustment of the complaint
cannot be achieved, then the complainant indicates that he
wants a hearing and that is when the Civil Service Commission
appoints its hearing examiner and the hearing is held within
the agency.
Fortunately we have a good record in this case and
I would simply commend to the Court that you might want to read
the record of the hearing in this case because I .think it is an
example of how a hearing can operate.
entitled to be represented by counsel.

The individual is
It is not required to.

In this case, Mrs. Chandler represented herself and,
frankly, in my opinion, she did a good job.
There is a representative of the agency present as
well.

In this case, it would appear that the representative of

the agency was not a lawyer but in any event, it did not take
a vigorous adversary procedure.
The complaints examiner renders a recommended
decision and makes, in effect, findings of fact.

That is

forwarded to the agency itself which makes a decision and from
'hat point, the

complainant has two options.

He can either

go direct to court or he can appeal to the appeals review board
of the Civil Service Commission and following 180 days of the
filing either with the Civil Service Commission or with the

24

agency, he has the right to go into court.
The issue, it seems to us, is that whether it is
more consistent with these overall Civil Service Commission's
responsibilities and the fact of integration of the adjudication
process with the much broader federal equal employment
opportunity effort to relegate the Civil Service Commission to
the role of an examiner or the provider, if you will, of a
dress rehearsal, the traditional tandem of agency and court
in effecting congressional policy and in utilizing scarce
federal resources

for this purpose works best when the agency

brings its expertise to bear on substantive policy matters,
integrating its broader «rule-making authority with its
adjudicatory authority and the courts doing what they do best,
correcting errors of law, errors of procedure, excesses of
statutory power or constitutional right and correcting factual
errors only when they rise to the level of excesses of
substantial evidence and this, we submit, is what Congress must
have meant by integrating the complaint-adjudicating process as
a part of the Commissions broader equal employment opportunity
and federal merit system responsibilities and giving the
commission imparailed remedial powers.
Senator Wi.Haims stated at the conclusion — at
the time that all of the amendments were made and the Senate
Committee Report also states early in the legislative history,
crtat an important

adjunct to the strength and Civil Service

25
Commission responsibilities is the statutory provision of a
private right of action of review of the agency proceedings.
That "right of review" is Senator Williams language
later on.
Senate

That right of review language does not appear in the

Committee report.
But the point I would like to make is, that

both

regarded it as an adjunct to the strengthened Civil Service
Commission responsibilities.
It is significant in this regard that this Court's
decision in /Alexander versus Gardner-Denver, as I read it,
relies principally on the fact that in the private — in the
arbitration context, up until the time that you got into
court, the complainant had not had the access to any official
body of the Federal Government that had either the authority or
the responsibility for implementing and for fleshing out the
details and implementing of equal employment

opportunity

policy.
The statement is made a number of ways in a number
of different places in the Gardner-Denver opinion but the
thrust is always the same, that the responsibility of the
arbitrator is to implement the contract, whereas, the
responsibility of the Civil Service Commission, by contrast,
is to implement the statute.

The arbitrator simply has no

responsibility to implement the federal policy contained in
the 1972 amendment.

By contrast, the Civil Service Commission

26
doss and that is its principal responsibility»
Now, Justice Stewart asked the question whether
there would be any difference whether you appeal directly to
the appeals -- whether you appeal directly from the agency
or you go through the Appeals Review Board and I think it is
apparent now that my answer to that question is no and the
reason is that under either circumstance it is, we do have this
tandem of agency responsibility and court responsibility with
each doing the kind of things that they do best.
QUESTION:

You mean, each would be reviewing the

same record?
MR. LEE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct.

The Civil Service Commission would

review the record last made or if he took the route to the
District Court, that would be the basis
MR. LEE:

of the judicial review.

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice and I

am saying one more thing, and that .is, that whether you go
directly from the agency into court, it is a review of the
administrative record or if you go from the Civil Service
Commission in the court it is a review of the administrative
scord because under either circumstance, you have the agency
having brought its expertise to bear on the problem.
Now, to be sure, if it is direct from the agency,
it is a shared responsibility between Civil Service Commission
and the agency but it is still that kind of a tandem

27

responsibility between the court and agency.,
Mr» Selig has pointed out that Congress knew how to
provide for substantial evidence review.

That is very correct.

We also know that Congress knows how to provide for de novo
review and the fact of the matter is that in this case, the
language of the statute doesn't lend itself to either
interpretation.

There is the language — on the one hand

there are the statements of Senator Williams that clearly point
to record review.
There is the statement of Senator Domenick that
might lend itself to the other interpretation, though I would
point out that Senator Williams' statements ia this regard are
more to be — not trusted, but are more persuasive in this
context than those of Senator Domenick because all of Senator
Domenick's comments were given, or virtually all, were given
in the context of one who opposed a particular provision in
that statute and that was cease and desist authority in the
EEOC, whereas Senator Williams was the man who introduced the
bill that eventually became the law.
There is no one who is more familiar with this
bill as it went throughout the various steps than was Senator
Williams.
QUESTION:

Mr, Lee, on the point of

whether Con­

gress might have said so explicitly, taking the other side’s
position, explicitly, are there any other federal statutes that
/

23
have been construed to limit court review to the administrative
records where the statute has not expressly so stated?
MR. LEE:
Stevens.

I am confident that there are, Mr. Justice

There are — the two statements that we have quoted

in our brief come from the Bianci case and which was a Wunder­
lich Act review and that one does expressly provide for sub­
stantial evidence, as does Consolo and that makes the statement
in those cases dictum but it is very clear dictum and for that
reason, I can't give you an example, but this Court has
declared in the clearest possible language that that is the
general approach and once again, I find it very persuasive that
Congress did say that it regarded the right of civil action as
an adjunct to strengthen Civil Service Commission procedures.
The Petitioner finds significant the fact that in
the majority of cases there is no hearing.

We consider this

to be neutral insofar as the interpretation of this statute is
concerned.

If there has been no hearing, it is because the

Complainant has so

elected and has concluded, in effect, that

the investigation is sufficient and provides a sufficient

basis

for the record.
QUESTION:

The Complainant has ari absolute right to

that hearing.
MR. LEE:

That is correct.

Moreover, if the complainant elects not to have a
hearing, that does not mean there is not an administrative

29

record to review.

The administrative record for review in those*

circumstances is the investigation file.
Similarly, it has been urged by the amicus that
the average administrative proceeding takes 201 days, which is
longer than the 180 days, and that in some

cases it is much

higher.
As a matter of fact we are advised by the Civil
Service Commission that at the present time it is just a little
*

bit higher than that.
QUESTION:

That is talking about elapsed time from

beginning to end, not the time consumed in that number of days.
Is that right?
MR. LEE:

What we are talking about, Mr. Chief

Justice, is the period of time that it takes'from the filing of
the complaint up until the time that the administrative record
is complete.

You have 180 days at the agency level and you

also have 180 days at the Civil Service Commission Appeals
Review Board in the event that they elect that option.
«

But -— and I should also point out that with the

proposed adoption of class action procedures, we are likely ot
have other cases in which the elapsed time is even greater.
We do not see this as a significant problem as far
as the present issue is concerned for this reason.

In the

average case, where, beit the 201 or the 218, by the time

the

court reaches the issue, there will be an administrative record

30

because with 180 days just in the time to file an answer, it
would be up to the 218 days.
But let's take the case in which it is not 218,
maybe it is 300.

It is our view that what the Court should do

under those circumstances, for the reasons that we have been
talking about, is that the Court should entertain a stay motion
and should first inquire to determine what the reason

is for

the delay.
If the Court finds that it is for any reason other
than the fault of the agency, the Court should then favorably
entertain a stay motion and should wait for the completion of
the administrative record.
In the event that the delay is due to the agency's
fault, then it would be appropriate for the Court to proceed
with de novo review or to take other steps that are within the
discretion of the reviewing court.
Finally, tine point has -- or, it has also been
argued that there is a problem insofar as the procedures are
concerned with the examiner being the only one who has had the
opportunity to observe the — the credibility problem, the
demeanor problem.
In that respect, there are some cases in which
credibility and demeanor may occupy a large part of the case.
In those instances, if the agency and the Commission have not
followed the examiner's decision, then, under the traditional

31
rules of review that were established by this Court in the
Universal Camera case, the court can reverse on that ground
alone, that inadequate consideration was given to what the
examiner did and, similarly, another alternative would be simply
to remand the case for further consideration.
In this particular case, credibility was not a large
issue.

There really wasn't a substantial issue insofar as what

happened and who was telling the truth and who wasn't.
The principal issue in this case was whether it is
more important in selecting section chiefs to rely on individual
specific kinds of skills such as the ability to read computer
print-outs and experience in specific phases of the agency's
work or whether the larger, more subjective kind of skills such
as the ability to motivate people was —
QUESTION:
thing.

But they did find difficulty with the sex

They didn't find difficulty with the race point, so

wouldn't credibility be something in there?
MR. LEE:

Mr. Justice Marshall, if you look carefully

at what the examiner concluded with regard to sex, it did not
depend in any way on what the witnesses said or on the matter
of credibility of one having said one thing and one having said
another and which was telling the truth.
She relied on three considerations, all of which
were judgment balancing kinds of considerations which can be
as well by a reviewing body as by the one who has heard the

32

t

evidence.
In conclusion,- we submit that Congress has made a
comprehensive effort to assure equal employment opportunity in
the Federal Government.

It is an effort that consists of

several interlocking components, including review of equal
opportunity, employment opportunity plans, training, upward
mobility, affirmative action, adjudication of grievances,
complete with full remedia,! authority that is unparalled any­
where else, either within government or outside,,
The administration of this total integrated whole
is charged to the Civil Service Commission, already experienced
and unique in its expertise in areas of hiring, training and
promotion which are the consistent touchstones of equal
opportunity issues.
To wrench from this integrated whole one inter­
locking component would work serious damage to the careful
scheme intended by Congress.
For this reason, we respectfully urge that the
Court affirm the judgment of the court below.
QUESTION:

The alternative that your friends are

suggesting is that this be entrusted to 403 or 425 federal
district judges who treat the matter as any other independent
kind of litigation, trying it de novo.
MR. LEE:

That is true and that, Mr. Chief Justice,

specifically is the problem.

There are 423.

We wish there were

33
473 but there are 423 of them, one of whom is charged with the
total, unifying responsibility»
The only place in the judicial system where that
kind of total, unifying responsibility could possibly rest is
right here in this Court.
A

By contrast, the Civil Service Commission does have
the total responsibility.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr, Lee, your opponents also suggest that

Congress wasn't all that

convinced that the Civil Service

Commission had the high degree of expertise in the field of
equal opportunity, in fact, that it had been lagging some and
that that is the reason they advanced»

Isn't there some

indication in the legislative history that that was the feeling
of Congress?
MR. LEE:

Surely and. that is totally irrelevant

as far as the present issue is concerned.
cuts our way.

The fact is

In fact, it even

that notwithstanding that concern,

Congress said several things.

One is, that notwithstanding

that concern, the Civil Service Commission — they did choose
the Civil Service Commission and in that respect, in order to
assist it, yet the committee was persuaded the Civil Service
Commission is sincere in its dedication to the principles of
equal employment.
In order to assist the Commission in accomplishing

34

this goal? to make clear the Congressional expectation, it was
given responsibilities to function in developing a comprehensive
equal employment opportunity program.
The fact of the matter is that notwithstanding those
concerns, which were thoroughly aired in Congress, it was the
total responsibility that was clearly placed in the Civil
Service Commission and I don't want to give the impression that
I don’t think that it is working.
You look at that statement by Chairman Hampton.

My

friends have indicated the performance of the EEOC with regard
to back-pay awards.

Well, that is all, really, that the EEOC

can get through the courts is.back-pay awards.
But in the federal sector, far more important than
back-pay is GS grade because that relates not only to money,
it also relates to future status and to other employment
considerations that are equally as important as money and as that
report shows, at the same time that federal employment has been
going down, we have had a perceptible improvement at all of the
GS levels insofar as minorities are concerned.
But the principal point is, that whether it is
succeeding or not, if the Commission has acted in excess of
its statutory responsibility, then that is the basis for
complaint in court.

That is the kind of thing that courts do

we 11.
If, in fact, they are saying that Congress made the

35
wrong judgment in giving this kind of responsibility to the
Civil Service Commission, then the remedy there is in Congress.
But you can’t simply say

you can’t simply make a subjective

judgment that the Civil Service has not been doing as well as
it ought to do and therefore reject the judgment that Congress
made that this is where the responsibility lies.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, I have a question for you before

you sit down, if I may.
Throughout your brief, you emphasize and repeat
that the rule that you propose of review cn an administrative
record should be the rule in the ordinary case, that it should
be the general rule and you make it very explicit that you can
see there may be and are exceptions -- exceptions

when there

has been inordinate delay of the administrative review and
another exception you suggest but when a witness has not been
amenable to compulsory px-oeess because he is not a government
employee and you suggest there may be others.
Is this — do you know of any other situation where
a court has an option of either reviewing something on the
administrative record or not?
MR. LEE:

I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, in -- that

generally, the review of the administrative record necessarily
implies, and I think this has been the consistent practice that
the court has to have a certain discretion. 'Now —
QUESTION:

Is that true in Labor Board cases, for

36
example, and review by the courts of appeals?
MR. LEE:
QUESTION:

Well, I would think that if -Have you ever heard of one where the

court of appeals took additional evidence?
MR, LEE;

MR. LEE:

Well, the court of appeals —
Well, that is the reviewing agency.
Yes, I understand.
Of many administrative -Rather than sending it back, you mean?
Yes.
No, I don't.

Of course, the Court of

Appeals is not quite as well set up to take the -—
QUESTION:

No, but it is the court of appeals that

is the reviewing court in most matters, as you well know.
MR. LEE;
QUESTION:

That's right,
And do you know of any analog to what

you suggest?
MR. LEE:

No, I don’t.

But I think that it follows

from this kind of statutory structure and that it simply makes
sense in the discretion of —- to allow this kind of discretion
in the district court for those two kinds of circumstances.
QUESTION:

And you suggest that there may be

others?
MR. LEE:
QUESTION:

There may be.

We can't —

lr you have a careful lawyer — or a

37

cautious lawyer.
MR. LEE;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Selig.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL L. SELIG, ESQ.
MR. SELIG;

Mr. Justice Marshall, credibility

certainly was in issue in this case and I would direct the
Court’s attention to pages 63 through 67 of the certified
administrative record.
Appendix.

The pages are not produced in the

It is part of the testimony of the selective

supervisor.
The Civil Service Commission, in affirming the
agency decision repeatedly relied upon the explanations of the
selecting supervisor as to why he selected Mr. Dineros rather
than Mrs. Chandler and if you look at the pages that I am
citing you to, I think you will see the reason why the complaints
examiner, at least, found no credibility in those explanations.
The court, of course, had no opportunity to hear
Mr. Holland testify and one of the first acts the Petitioner
did in the district court was to try to take fir. Holland’s
deposition and I suppose she would have called him as a witness
in the distri'ct court.
Mow, it is also suggested that these cases are so
9

complicated and it is so difficult to distinguish between
discrimination and a valid personnel procedure that the courts
will not be

able to understand these cases and deal with them.

38

At page 11 in footnote 14 of our reply brief, we
have cited the case of United States against United States
Steel Corporation.

That is a case in which the government was

the plaintiff.
We would commend that to the Court’s attention and
there are several different opinions in there.
That is a case which is extremely complicated and
yet the Court was able to

deal with it.

The lines of pro­

gression, the way in which the United States Steel in Birming­
ham operates requires a great deal of expertise even to begin
to understand what is going on at the United

States Steel

Corporation and yet the courts have to deal with this kind of
thing every day.
They al«o have to deal with testing, which is
extremely complicated.
Nov?, we think it is significant with respect to
the question of the hearing that the statute does not require
that these cases be determined after a hearing, nor does the
commission.
In the draft legislation providing for cease and
desist review in' the private sector and review on the record
in the court of appeals, the committee bill, the Hawkins Bill,
those draft legislation required that hearings be conducted
by the EEOC.

They also contained the stay provision to which

counsel referred.

Of course, neither the stay provision or the

39

provision requiring a hearing in the private sector is contained
in the statute as enacted and I don't think that it is the
function of the Court to read things into the statute which are
not there, particularly when they were there under antecedent
draft legislation,,

I’d like to —

QUESTION:

Is my understanding correct that here a

complainant has an absolvite right to a hearing —

;
MR. SELIG:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

— in each agency.

MR. SELIG:
QUESTION:
MR. SELIG:

That is correct, your Honor.
And only he may waive it.

That is correct.

Now, of course, I would like to say something about
the middle positions which have been assumed by some of the
courts of appeals.

Obviously, this Court is not bound by the

positions advocated by either party, but we feel very strongly
that these middle positions are also completely inadequate and
we have discussed the reasons for this at some length in our
brief.

Indeed, we think the government’s position implicitly

recognises that there is no middle ground in this area.
Either the court is the finder of fact or the
agency is the finder of fact.
QUESTION;

Well, the government takes, if not a

middle position, it doesn't take — it admits of exceptions to
the rule that it advocates.

40
MR. SELIG:

Very narrow exceptions, your Honor, I

would suggest.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it concedes, pro tanto,

that

the rule it advocates may be inadequate or defective in certain
circumstances.

Is that correct?

MR. SELIG:

That is correct but I think that the

exceptions that they are recognizing are very narrow.
But, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think the problem —
there are several problems with these middle rules, which some
of the lower courts have adopted and which are not being
advocated by the government, but one big problem .with them
is that they put the burden on the wrong party.

They put the

burden on the plaintiff to show a need to go beyond the
administrative record.
They put a burden on the plaintiff to show that it
is necessary to have discovery, that it is necessary to have
other witnesses testify.
Well, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
if discovery is inappropriate, it is the defendant’s burden
to show that it is inappropriate under the rules and .under the
applicable case la*w.
QUESTION:

But you are not starting from scratch

here, as you would be in a civil action in a district court in
its primary jurisdiction, are you?
MR. SELIG:

Well, you. are starting — well, first of

41
all, Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t think it is contended by anyone
that the commission has primary jurisdiction in the normal
sense of that word but you are starting from scratch as far as
the complainant having control over the dissolvingjof his case.
QUESTION:

Well, I am suggesting that the com­

plaining party has had a good deal of procedure up to that time.
MR. SELIG:

Well, as we have said, we assume that

the administrative record is admissible.

We also assume that

duplication without a purpose can be prevented by the district
court.

But I think the important phrase, as Judge Leventhal

stated it, is duplication without a purpose.

Sometimes there

is a purpose in duplication.
Frequently, in antitrust cases,

there are large

numbers of depositions that have been taken and this is true
in many areas of the law.
I think, finally, that, of course, it

is conceded

by the government — as it would have to be conceded in the
light of Morton against Mancari, that what we are up to here is
providing the same substantive law, the same substantive rights
•in the federal sector as in the private sector.
It is our position, basically, that you cannot
separate substance and procedure in this area and this is why
we believe the Court noted in Alexander that the choice of
forums inevitably affects the scope of the substantive right
to be vindicated and this is why

we believe that the general

42
principle which is applicable here is the principle stated in
the House Committee report and quoted by the

Court in Mancari

and that is, that the present law and the proposed statute do
not permit industry and labor organizations to be the judges
of their own conduct in the area of employment discrimination
and there is no reason why government agencies should not
be treated similarly.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, the case was
submitted.]
