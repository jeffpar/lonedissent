MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1194, Enomoto against Clutchette.
Mr. Stein, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DOUGLAS STEIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. STEIN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and members of

May it please the Court:

I am William Douglas Stein, Deputy Attorney General
of the State of California, appearing here today on
behalf of Jerry J. Enomoto, the director of our California
Department of Corrections.
This case commenced effectively on November the 14th,
1S7Q with a major incident in the visiting room of the
San Quentin State Prison involving an inmate named John
Wesley Cluchette, who was then confined in our maximum
security section.
/

As a result of that disturbance, a disciplinary
hearing was scheduled six days later for November the 20th.
On that same date counsel who was representing Mr. Clu­
chette in a state criminal prosecution that was going on
at that time filed a civil rights action in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of
California.
That action sought a temporary restraining order to

4
prevent the disciplinary hearing that was scheduled for
that date, a declaratory judgment that the procedures
used by our department at that time lacked due process
safeguards, and injunction barring such hearings and
$30,000 in money damages.
Of course, the temporary restraining order was
denied, but an order to show cause did issue returnable
on December 4th, why a preliminary injunction should not
issue in the matter.
The day before I appeared at that order to
show cause hearing the complaint was amended.

The

complaint was amended to add one more name plaintiff
and class actions allegations.
Since that time the matter has been considered
by the court as a class action,
QUESTION:

Has it been, in fact, certified as

a class action?
MR. STEIN:
found a certification.

To my knowledge, and I have not
However, the district court's

opinion discusses relief.

It mentions both the name

plaintiffs, Mr. Cluchette and Mr. Jackson and ordered —
actually ordered expungement of their disciplinary records,
ordered specific relief to them and then mentioned
plaintiffs generally so I have taken it that since that
opinion and order of the district court, the matter has

5

been considered as a class action»
QUESTION:

Formally certified?

MR* STEIN:

No, I can find nothing in the

record formally certifying it.
QUESTION:

The —

Is that significant, whether we

treat it as a class action?
MR. STEIN:

It comes up now and again in the

case and I am not sure that it is because any injunction
that ran — it. has always been my position that any
injunction that ran is against the procedures that were
in use since those procedures were applied to all inmates.
The issue is going to be decided whether it is
a class action or not.
QUESTION:
still hare.

Of course, the name plaintiff is

I mean, Cluehetta is still in it.

MR. STEIN:

The name plaintiff — John Wesley

Cluchette is the name plaintiff.

He was subsequently

paroled and the other name plaintiff, Georgs Jackson,
was killed in an escape attempt so a third person was,
by stipulation, admitted as a name plaintiff to prevent
the exhaustion of the class of plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is no question

about this status of the class plaintiffs in the district
court originally?
MR. STEIN:

We never had —- there was never any

6
litigation about the class.

The only evidence that was

taken was taken at a hearing on an order to show cause
why a preliminary injunction should not issue.

X. appeared

there in response to an order to show cause about a
particular inmate’s disciplinary hearing on a particular
day involving a particular incident.
At the close of that — as X say, it was the
day before the complaint was amended and at the close of
that hearing# the judge stated that any injunction he
issued would# in fact# be a permanent injunction.
The -QUESTION:

Well# you mean you thought the

hearing was on a preliminary injunction?
MR. STEIN:

The order to show cause concerned

a complaint filed naxned one plaintiff, John Wesley
Cluchette and attacked the conditions or the procedures
to be used at his disciplinary hearing on one particular
data# November the 20th.

At the hearing there was

evidence taken that the procedures would not materially
be differant but as far as the factual issue that we
litigated on December the 4th# 1970# the only evidentiary
hearing ever held in this case concerned a particular
incident and the sole witness that was presented was the
chairman of the disciplinary committee that heard
Mr. Cluchette*s complaint.

7
QUESTION:

Well, but that would go to the

breadth of the injunction ax\d not to whether it should
have been a preliminary as opposed to a permanent,
wouldn't it?
MR. STEIN:

That is correct.

Now, as I say, at this evidentiary hearing we
presented — or he was called by the petitioners or by
the plaintiffs — the man who was the chairman of the
disciplinary committee that heard the infraction
against inmate Cluchette.
I think material to the issue, the main issue
about whether counsel was required at that hearing is his
testimony that the standard Miranda warning was given.
That warning had been given in California prisons whenever
a

disciplinary infraction could be punished as a felony

since Dorado was — since the Dorado case in California
which occurred between Escobedo and Miranda.
He was specifically informed that his case
appeared to be a felony and that it would be —or could
be turned over to the local district attorney who would
have a prosecutorial decision to make, whether or not to
prosecute that case.
Cluchette signed a waiver form.

He signed a

form waiving his Miranda rights and he agreed to speak
to the committee.

s
Now, the chairman of the committee remembered
that Inmate Cluchefcte did ask for certain witnesses to
be called and that was denied.
cedures did not provide

At that time the pro™

for any testimony taken other

than by written document.
He was unclear as to whether inmate Cluchette
requested his attorney's presence but it has never been
litigated between tha parties.

The attorney had sent a

telegram to the prison requesting his presence and of
course, as I say, he filed the action the day of tha
hearing, attempting to stop the hearing so that he could
be present*
So there is no evidence in the record that
Inmate Cluchette did, in fact, ask for the attorney but
we have never challenged that.

We have always conceded

that he did, in fact, ask at the hearing but just that
the chairman did not hear it.
The chairman testified that had Inmate Cluchette
refused to

waive his Miranda rights, he would not have

been questioned, that they would have then in that
situation made their determination of the disposition •—
first of all, a finding of guilt or innocence and
disposition on the basis of the written reports they had
before them and at that time

all of our disciplinary

hearings were conducted on the basis of written reports.

9

There was no live testimony»
The gist of the written reports, he testified,
were written — were read to Inmate Cluchette.
Now, the reports were voluminous.
were 13 to 15 supplemental reports.

I think there

The rules and

regulations of the director of corrections require any
person having knowledge or seeing an incident involving —
any incident of disciplinary hearing to file a written
report.
They were not given to the inmate.
allowed to see them or read them.

He was not

The material portions

were read to him by the committee.
As I say, the committee — the hearing lasted
about an hour and the following punishments were imposed:
Inmate Cluchette was ordered confined in
isolation for 29 days.

Concurrent with being retained

in cell status for 29 days, his privileges were removed
for 60 days and the matter was referred to the district
attorney for prosecution.
•The matter was, in fact, never prosecuted.
Now, Inmate — as I pointed out earlier, at the
start, Inmate Cluchette was already housed in our maximum
security section so he was retained in the same cell, the
same type of cell as he had been in before the incident.
I believe he was moved to a different cell

10

because isolation requires the removal of personal
property from the inmate's cell except for legal
materials; religious materials and toilet articles and
I think it was easier to move Inmate Cluehette to
another blank cell than to remove his goods from his —■
what then would be property ha should not have from his
other cell.
So I believe he was moved to another cell but
it was the exact same sise, shape cell that he had been
housed in before the incident.
QUESTION :

How was the isolation carried out,

then?
MR. STEIN:

Well, that isolation — that term

as used in California at that time meant — and testimony
to this is in the record — that all personal property,
items of personal property except, as I said, for
religious materials, legal materials and toilet articles,
ware removed from the cell.
He was — and then he would be — if isolation
were the only punishment, he would also be restricted to
the call for 23 hours a day.

He would be allowed one hour

a day exercise outside the cell.
But this next punishment imposed was cell status
which alters that and required him to remain in his cell
24 hours a day.

There was no outside exercise permitted.

11
However# he was not isolated in the sense that
he could not speak to other inmates.
He could not see other inmates celled, next to
him as the walls are solid between the cells and there are
no cells in that section facing but he could speak
through the bars to the people on either side and they
exercised up and down the tier and he could talk to any
inxaate who was exercising in the tier.
Now# cell status has an additional penalty.
As I said# the one-hour exercise normally allowed inmates
in isoation was removed so for 29 days he had no outside
cell exercise.
He did leave the cell twice a week to shower,
for family visits# attorney visits and for parole board
'■appearances.

That is allowed on cell status.

In addition# the removal of his privileges for
60 days denied him the privilege of purchasing items at
the canteen and other limited

privileges that fire

available to maximum security inmates.

Those are very

much curtailed because of his housing in maximum security.
As I said# following the hearing, a permanent
injunction issued#expungement of the records of the
disciplinary proceedings held were — of the two named
plaintiffs were ordered.
The injunction was stayed pending the appeal by

12

the district court except for the part of the opinion
that required us to present a plan for conducting
disciplinary hearings in the

future that complied with

the procedures sat forth in the district court's opinion.
Now* we submitted a plan to the district court
in January of 8 72.

That plan was later put into practice

voluntarily by the director throughout California's
prisons.

As the plan was put into practical effect,

certain changes became obvious that had to be made,
intervening State Supreme Court judgments and, in fact,
opinions of this Court required further changes which
were made and subsequently supplemental plans have been
submitted to the district court,
QUESTION:

When you say voluntarily, Mr. Stein,

do you mean, not under the compulsion of the district
court8 s order?
MR. STEIN:

That is correct, your Honor.

Unlike

the situation in Morris we have never been ordered to
change the plan.

That part of the order telling us to

permanently enjoining us was stayed pending the appeal
and it is still stayed as this case is here today.
QUESTION:

Well, then, are you in a position to

complain about anything that is included in your voluntary
plan?
MR, STEIN:

Certainly, your Honor,

I think we

13

are because anything — we are complaining that that
plan

we were ~~ we have been asked to draft a plan to

comply with the district court's opinion.

That plan has

been objected to strenuously by the plaintiffs her®, by
the way, as not complying.
But to the extent that we go further than is
required by the Constitution, your Honor, I don't believe
our acquiescence should be read as concession that it
constitutionally complies,
QUESTION:

Well, but it seerns to me, in order

to be able to maintain that position you would have to
say that because the plan was originally directed to be
submitted by the district court, it is under the force of
the court’s order.
Otherwise, if you are doing something voluntarily
that is beyond the Constitution I don’t think you have any
claim here.
MR. STEIN:

Well, the issues, the specific

issues we have raised here in this case are not in the
plan.

We do not provide counsel where the matter is

pending as a criminal trial,
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:
to call witxxesses.
QUESTION:

So here —
We do not offer the unlimited right
That’s
Here you are not challenging anything

14
that is included in your plan, in this court.
MR. STEIN:

That is correct.

The other problem we have, too, your Honor, is
that we now have a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal opinion
which imposes —- this is the opinion we have appealed
from here.

We are on cert to review.

Which imposes

procedures way beyond the constitutional limits as we
read them and it is the Ninth Circuit opinion — the
jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit takes in considerably
more than California.
If that opinion is affirmed, then Oregon,
Washington, Arizona, New Mexico and all federal prisons
in the Western United States will have to comply.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if California were doing

it voluntarily it wouldn't have standing to raise the
claims of Oregon and Washington just because the Ninth
Circuit covers those territories, 1 wouldn't think.
MR. STEIN;

It would require another lawsuit

from Oregon or Washington.
QUESTION;

Well, are you doing voluntarily

everything the Ninth Circuit says you have to do?
MR. STEIN;

MR. STEIN;
impression.

No, we are not.
No.
No, I didn't want to leave that

As I stated, just shortly before Wolff was

15
decided in this Court, the Ninth Circuit issued its
opinion which extended the due process procedures ordered
by the district court to the including of the removal
of any privilege.
We petitioned for rehearing following the
decision in Wolff.

A rehearing was granted.

The opinion

was purportedly modified to conform to Wolff.
that the entire circuit hear the case.

We suggested

That was denied.

We petitioned for cert and we are here today.
I am here, basically, to argue two points.

One,

the one that troubles us the most and was argued in the
last case, is the requirement that we supply counsel in
all casas where the alleged infraction is punishable as
a crime and we would like to discuss what

we view as

the proper role of lower federal courts in imposing
constitutional restrictions on the state prison
administrators.

Briefly

QUESTION:
to argue.

I got your first point you are going

I am not sure I got the second.
MR. STEIN s
QUESTION:

The —
The first is the same as we heard in

the previous case, I know.
MR. STEIN:
is required.

The first point is, whether counsel

Now, to the extent that we believe that the

Ninth Circuit has exceeded the direct mandate of this

16

Court in Wolff, we

believe that they have exceeded the

proper role in applying the United States Constitution
in state prison situations and, briefly —
QUESTION:

With respect to confrontation and

so on?
MR, STEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
1 see.

MR. STEIN:

There has been one nagging

distinction, purported distinction in this case between
the Nebraska case that I think has bean put to rest by
a recent California Supreme Court decision decided after
our briefs were filed.
Throiighout this case it has always been argued
by the Respondents and the inmates that because of
California’s indeterminate sentence law, their situation
is distinguished from Nebraska's good time credit
sentencing the distinction being, of course, in California
that the judge only sentenced the defendant to the term
prescribed by law and our parole board sets both the
maximum sentence and the parole release date.
They have argued that because a single
disciplinary infraction of a major nature could be basis
for the parole board's authority to extend their sentence
to the maximum which, in many cases, is life, that it
distinguishes them from the good time credit cases such

17
as Nebraska where the man has a fixed sentence and he
works it off on good time credit.
Since the briefs were filed, the California
Supreme Court has considerably modified the indeterminate
sentence law and, its current application, 1 submit,
renders the purported distinction one without a
difference.
In a case entitled In Re Rodrigues

reported

at Volume 122 of the California Reporter 552, the
California Supreme Court required our adult authority or
parole board to set a maximum sentence for every inmate
based on the culpability of the individual offender as
reflected in the circumstances at the time of the offense.
That sentence can no longer be raised.
term can no longer be changed,
can

That

It can be reduced but it

never be increased back to the statutory maximum.
Now, the plaintiffs, when they filed the

initial complaint argued that the imposition of discipline
in a case would automatically or could possibly result
in the extension of their sentences.
The Court of Appeals held the effect to be too
nebulous to require them to proceed in habeas corpus and
exhaust their state remedies but did, in fact, hold that
the notation of a single disciplinary could be so detri­
mental to their interest in liberty through their release

18

on parole that the entire range of due process was
required.
I submit that, following the Rodriguez modi­
fication that you can no longer distinguish the effect of
the California indeterminate sentence law from the good
time credit situation and that there is no basis Qn that
ground to distinguish this case from Wolff.
In fact, as I remember in Wolff, there was one
particular inmate whose good time *— had up to 11 months
good time credit removed during the — as a result of
a disciplinary hearing.

That was an automatic extension

of his sentence, 17 months.
In California, the most that could occur would
be a denial of release on parole.

His maximum sentence

could no longer be increased and traditionally, the denial
of parole has always been reviewed on a 12-month series.
So we submit that since our California
indeterminate sentence law has been modified, in effect,
our procedure is better than Nebraska's on that situation,
in that case,

It cannot be distinguished and we stand

on a better footing.
The main issue, of course, is whether counsel
is required at these hearings.
Th© Ninth Circuit held that in thair modification
their modification, their opinion following Wolff, that

19

Wolff didn1t require it but that your decision in Miranda
required it.
I know it has been argued before and I would
have to repeat it, that prison disciplinary proceedings
as conducted in California, under the procedures outlined
in Wolff are not amalagous to the police station
interrogation that brought forth the Miranda rules.

There

is simply no custody in the California disciplinary
hearing,
The .rules provide that the inmate will be
present,

However”, he — no physical force will be used

to bring him to the hearing if he does not wish to attend
and he may leave when he desires.
The hearings conducted under the proceedings
in Wolff -—
QUESTION:

Let's be a little realistic.

In a

prison, if somebody tails you to be someplace, you go
there v
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION;

Excuse me?
In a prison, if somebody tells you to

go someplace, you go.
MR. STEIN: Well, Mr. Cluchette was told to
move himself from the visiting table to anofche^room and
he broke a chair and assaulted the officers with the
leg of it

20

QUESTION s
MR, STEIN:

And he got in a whole lot of trouble
He got 29 days in

isolation and

cell status.
QUESTION:

Right.

So I am saying that normally

a request in a prison is an order.
MR. STEIN:

Well, that is correct but no one —•

the rules specifically provide — and all the inmates are
furnished copies of these rules.

They are not kept by

the prison administrators for themselves and I can almost
quote uhem, that no physical force will be used to bring
the inmate to the hearing so they do request hi.3 appear* anca and — but he knows that if he doesnft want to go,
they are not going to drag him in there.
In any event, he arrives.
it is an informal panel.

He in informed that

There are findings made

and I submit there is no interrogation.

We specifically

advise the man of his Fifth Amendment rights, in the
event he is unaware of them,
QUESTION:

We give him the opportunity

You may advise them, but do you

interrogate them if — do you start to interrogate them?
MR. STEIN:

The testimony here was that they

asked the man how he will plead to the charge.
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

Yes.
Guilty or not guilty.

That if he

requests to remain silent, he will not be questioned.

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but what if he doesn't request

to remain silent?
HR. STEIN:

Then they will question him.

QUESTION:

So there is interrogation unless he

claims the privilege,
MR. STEIN:

Unless he claims the privilege and

the rules specifically provide that no adverse interest
will be drawn if he remains silent.

They will not

consider that adverse to the inmate.
The purpose of the hearings, of course, is not
the same as the police station interrogation.

This Court

has set forth the purposes of the disciplinary hearing
better than I can.

It has also described the conditions

of the state prisons and what are the reasons behind the
opinions in Preiser and the tensions and all that are
involved in a prison system.
I won't take time today to go back over that.
But as I say, the purpose is not to elicit statements for
use of a subsequent criminal prosecution.
If Miranda has any effect at all, it is not -there is no — I don't perceive that there is a right to
receive the Miranda admonitions.

I think the prison

authorities have the discretion to either give them or
not give them, running the risk that if the inmate says
anything, Miranda will be applied ultimately in a criminal

22
trial to prevent the admission of the statement.

We have

voluntarily agreed to give the Miranda admonition.
It is unfortunate that the admonition that was
given probably went too far in that it advised him of his
right to an attorney and when he asked about that, he was
told that right arose if the district attorney talked to
him or if he went to a criminal trial.
QUESTION:

When you say you voluntarily give the

Miranda warning out, does that mean you also provide
counsel?
MR. STEIN:

No.

No.

We do not provide counsel.

We give the man —
QUESTION:

So what, in effect, you are saying

is, you give Fifth Amendment ™MR. STEIN:

We give the Fifth Amendment and I

think that is as far as we should have to go# is to advise
the man of his right to remain silent under the Fifth
Amendment and that anything he says could be used against
him in a subsequent prosecution.
At the time they were reading from the standard
Miranda warning card and they went beyond that and told
him of his right to an attorney but the testimony before
the district court was that if he asked for an attorney
he would be advised that the attorney would be provided
if and when he was ever prosecuted criminally but not at

23

the hearing»
QUESTION s

And you do allow attorneys outside

of the hearing room for the purpose of advising the
inmate prior to the hearing1?
MR. STEIN:

Well, the inmate can always

communicate with an attorney, yes, that is true.

We

don't allow the attorney to, as in a grand jury situation,
remain outside and the inmate goes .
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

Back and forth.
■— back and forth.

No, wa don't

allow that.
We submit that Miranda doesn't require that
we furnish attorneys.

It gives — effectively, what it

does is, it gives the state the choice

of either

continuing to question the maA or give him an attorney.
QUESTION;
of substantive law.

Well, it doesn't do that as a matter
Miranda simply says what may not be

admitted in a criminal trial.
MR. STEIN;
QUESTION;
MR. STEIN:

It is a rule of evidence, 1 think.
That is right.
And its fulcrum for its application

is in an ultimate criminal
QUESTION:

trial.

That is right and it doesn't say what

the state has to do or doesn't have to do in an interro­
gation of anybody.

24

MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
It just has to do with what can be

admitted in a criminal trial,
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

Is that it?

Yes, that is the point I ant —
So, actually, if that is right, this

issue should really have never coma up until the
subsequent criminal trial if xm are just going to decide
cases that are before us.
MR. STEIN:

That is correct, your Honor.

As

a matter of fact, there are statistics in this record to
show that some 200 — in a certain period of time, some
267 inmates were ultimately referred for prosecution.
Eleven of those inmates were prosecuted.

Fourteen of

those inmates made statements characterised by the
Respondents as arguably incriminating.
I submit that it is a waste of everyone's time
and effort to provide 267 attorneys at disciplinary
hearings when there is only going to be ultimately 11
trials and even if every one of those 11 gave a statement,
and that is not clear, that due process can bs satisfied
by the traditional rules of voluntariness of an admission
of a statement and then he will have an attorney as a
representative at the trial.
QUESTION:

At any rata, there is no occasion for

any court to pass on that question until it is confronted

25
with it.
MR. STEIN:

We tried the Ninth Circuit.

We

tried to convince the Ninth Circuit of that and yet they
have, in their opinion, said we must provide an attorney
whenever the charge is criminal.
hare.

That is what brings us

I am as sorry as anyone that wa are here, really, I
QUESTION:

Didn’t you say in this one that he

was not prosecuted?
MR, STEIN:

No, he was not prosecuted.

H® was

referred for prosecution but the prison authorities don't
decide what is and is not

prosecuted.

That is the

district attorney's role.
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

We know that.
And he was -- yes, and he receives

those complaints.
QUESTION:

I think I perhaps did not get the

distinction you drew before.

You suggested that the

prisoner may always communicate with an attorney but
during the course of one of these proceedings, a disci­
plinary proceeding, the attorney may not be nearby for
him to consult.
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:
communicate?

That is correct.
When is it that he is permitted to

That is what I don’t understand.

MR. STEIN: .Okay.

Well, they generally can

26

write letters to attorneys at any time, communicate back
and fox'fch, and they ara given notice of the charges well
before the — but we are not -QUESTION:
MR. STEIN;
QUESTION;

I see.
I am not —
But it would be in advance.

He

would have the opportunity to, somehow to communicate with
the attorney in advance of the actual disciplinary
proceedings, the hearing.
MR. STEIN:

Yes, that is right.

The time of

notice and hearing, as I say, it was six days in this
case and obviously he got in touch with his attorney
because he filed the civil rights action.
QUESTION:

And may the attorney come to the

institution and —
MR. STEIN:

And interview?

There is visiting

provided for between the attorneys and the inmates,
certainly.
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

Even one as — as Clutchette v;as?
Oh, yes, even one on cell status

or isolation —
QUESTION;
MR, STEIN:

Yes.
— is allowed out of his cell to

have interviews with his attorneys.
QUESTION:

Is there some form that the authorities

27
us® at the hearing to advise him of his rights?
MR. STEIN:

There's the — we were using at

that time the standard Miranda warning card which lists
all of the admonitions and asks the two questions, do
you understand and if you understand
QUESTION:

But would you suppose someone would

understand from that that they are advising him that
whatever he says could be lased against hint, not only for
purposes of a disciplinary hearing but for purposes of
some later criminal proceeding?
MR. STEIN:

Oh, it specifically says that any­

thing you say can be used against you in the trial in the
criminal prosecution.

That is in the record.

The

admonitions are set forth and they were in the ultimate.

Ha was first adviied

that he might be prose­

cuted criminally and that any statements he used would
be used in that — could be used in that prosecution.
The — one of the problems we have ia that the —
after the Wolff decision whan we preitioned for rehearing
in the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit specifically says
in their opinion that the issue of counsel in this
situation was not reached by Wolff and they went on to
reach it and we submit that where the lower federal courts
are reviewing a state prison procedure, if they want to ~
if they think that is unconstitutional, they should point

28
to a direct holding of this Court,

They should, not

reach these matters on decisions they might reach were
they the ultimate arbiter.
They can reach that, I submit to you, in federal
prisons, in federal litigation, but when they do that in
state litigation they limit down to one the total — the
parameters that we can experiment in.
At the moment, we have, every state in the
Western United States is bound by this decision in
Glutchatfee and must supply counsel and as I submit, there
was no direct holding in Wolf ff and when the Ninth Circuit
realized that there was no direct holding in Wolff, they
should have —• at the most they could have issued, I
submit, would be an advisory opinion that if this came
up in a federal case they would require counsel but they
should have remanded this case to the state courts where
they belonged.
Even JUdge Zirpoii, at the close of the hearing
we held in the district court, notes in his record that
"It is unfortunate that this case came at the first to a
federal court.13
I'd reserve any remaining time X might have for
rebuttal.

Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
Mr, Turner.

Very well, Mr. Stein,

29

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BENNETT TURNER, ESQ*
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. TURNERS

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
There is no issue in this case as to the type
of misconduct that is punishable within a prison or as to
the type of punishment that can be imposed by prison
officials.
The issue hers involves the reliability of the
fact-finding process used within the prison and only in
very serious cases in which there is a dispute about the
facts.
We are not dealing in this case with any
emergency situation.

The court below specifically said

that prison officials always have the discretion- to
isolate any disruptive prisoner without any hearing,.
These disciplinary proceedings involved in this
case are those that can substantially alter a man's
conditions of confinement and prolong his term of
incarceration.
Nov?, it is also not the issue in this case
whether the procedures that were used at the time this
case was brought meet constitutional standards because,
they clearly do not.

None of the safeguards that this

Court required in the Wolff case were followed in .1970

30

when this case was brought.
Of course, California doesn't contend that they
were in compliance then.
QUESTION;

Mr. Turner, if these conditions can

prolong a man’s confinement, as you say, why is it
maintainable at all in 1993 under Preiser?
MR. TURNER;

Because the relief that is sought

in this case is not release.

It is not earlier release.

There is no challenge in this case to the fact or duration
of confinement.
QUESTION;

But there was an expungement of some

judgment, wasn't there?
MR. TURNER:

Well, there was a part of the

judgment which has never been carried out because it has
been stayed — was to expunge the disciplinary records in
this case.

There is no reason to believe that that would

lead to release of either of these men.
QUESTION:

But wouldn't it lead to at least

earlier release?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:
MR, TURNER:

No, not necessarily.
Well, possibly?
Remotely.

QUESTION:

Well, then, why isn't it barred under

QUESTION:

Because Preiser says that a 1983

Preiser?

31

action is barred only when the fact or duration of
confinement is being challenged and immediate or earlier
release is being sought.
Now, in Wolff? this case is acfctially covered by
Wolff because the only relief that is sought in this case
is an injunction against the prospective enforcement of
prison rules.

It is exactly like Wolff in that respect.

Footnote one in the Wolff decision covers it.
There is also not properly before this Court
the constitutionality of the current procedures that are
being used at San Quentin because the plan that is
currently in use was not before the Ninth Circuit.
There has been a good deal of new evidence,
discovery taken in the district court and the matter is
under submission in the district court.

Judge Zirpoli has

not yet rxiled on any aspect of the new plan and there is
indeed considerable dispute about how the new plan actually
operates in practice.
QUESTION:

When you say "new plan," just what

do you encompass in that?
MR. TURNER:

I mean by that, your Honor, the

plan which —
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

Everything the Ninth Circuit ordered?
No.

The plan that the officials

formally submitted to comply with Judge Zirpoli9s order.

32

Their current plan is in the record at page 296
beginning at page 296.

—

That is the plan that they are

operating under now and there has been no ruling by the
district court or by the Ninth Circuit about the adequacy
of the provisions of that plan.
I take it, then* that the issue that the Court
granted certiorari for is to consider whether the Ninth
Circuit required that when the plan is ruled upon by the
district court* that that plan would be required to have
too much due process in it.

I take it that is the state’s

complaint.
Of course, the state relies largely on the Wolff
decision.

We don't believe that Wolff can be read as

controlling every aspect of this case.
In the first place, the Court said that its
conclusions there were not graven in stone and the record
in this case shows quite a different set of circumstances
are

well, there are different circumstances here than

there were in the Nebraska prisons.
QUESTION:

Well, do you rely separately on that

language, "not graven in stone?” for a case remanded to a
court of appeals for reconsideration in the light of
Wolff?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Well —
Do you suggest that a court of appeals

33

is free to take some tack that is in any way inconsistent
with Wolff?
MR. TURNER:

No, I think they clearly have to

follow Wolff but they have to follow Wolff only insofar as
Wolff actually holds one thing or another and in this case
QUESTION:

Well, that would be true regardless of

whether there were language about being graven in stone,
wouldn't it?
MR. TURNER:

That is, of course, true.

The

primary distinguishing factor here between the situation
in Wolff is California's unique indeterminate sentence law
where the ranges of sentence — this, for example, in
Clutchette's case, his sentence for second degree burglary
was six months to 15 years and most of the common felonies
carry sentences of from five years to life.
The Adult Authority, which does the actual
sentencing and sets parole dates as well as maximum
sentences, usually meets a prisoner on an annual basis
and either sets a date or doesn't set a date but every
disciplinary infraction must be referred to the Adult
Authority for consideration at that time.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

And where is Clufechette now?
Clutchette is on parole.

He was

paroled in 1972.
QUESTION:

That is what I thought,

So this case

34

is moot as to him himself?
MR, TURNER;
QUESTION:

Yes.

No question of that.

MR. TURNER;
QUESTION:

No doubt about that,

Unless he is reincarcerated.
Well —

Is it or is it not moot as

to him?
MR. TURNER:

Yes, it is.

He wouldn’t be entitled

to any relief here, individually.
QUESTION:

Right.

But there is now a named

intervening plaintiff —
?

MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Alejandro Ferrell, who was —
Who is still —

MR. TURNER:

— who was joined as a party plain­

tiff in 1972 and who is still incarcerated at San Quentin.
QUESTION;

But it makes no difference now with

respect to Clutchette that the actual hearing he had did
not comply with -- even with what this Court held was what
was required in Wolff.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

That is right.

That is over the dam now.

MR. TURNER:
expungtion.

I suppose he might -

theoretically be interested in

There is a damage claim which he made which

has never been formally abandoned but I doubt seriously
that it will be pursued.
QUESTION:

Well, you said it was moot as to

35
Clutchett®.

Now, either it is or it is not in your

submission.
MR. TURNER;

I think for present purposes the

Court may consider that claim abandoned as to him.
QUESTION:

Well, this is not a class action.

It

is just a new name —
MR. TURNER:
Brennan.

Well, that is unclear, Mr. Justice

In the
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER:

Well, there has been no certification.
In the district court8s opinion,

it is said — Judge 3irpali said that the case is brought
as a class action under Rule 23 B{1) and B(2) and clearly,
all the requirements were met.

There was no separate

motion to certify —
QUESTION:

Is that tantamount to a certification

of this as a class action?
MR. TURNER:

I should think so.

Thera is no

question about the fact that the class —
QUESTION:

Of course, this new plaintiff is an

intervener, isn't he?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

He is ex parte plaintiff, yes.
That is what I mean.

Whether or not

it is class action, it —
MR. TURNER;
the issues here.

He has standing to raise all of

No doubt about that.

36
QUESTION;

I think in Jacobs last year we held

that where a district court has made exactly the same
observations at you suggest Judge Zirpoli made here, that
that was not a sufficient certification.

But I take it

it doesn't make any difference.
MR. TURNER;

I don't think it makes any differ-

ence in view of the other plaintiff who does have standing.
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER;
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER;

Who are the members of the class?
I beg your pardon?
Who are the members

of the class?

All prisoners at San Quentin.

That is how the class was defined in the initial complaint.
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

That is a pretty broad class.
Well —
Well, they aren't all brought up on

disciplinary actions, are they?
MR. TURNER:

No, but they may be; at any time and

any moment of any day they are subject to being called
before the disciplinary board on very serious charges.
QUESTION:

So are all the people that are

arrested and all the people about to commit crime.

That is

a pretty big group.
TURNER:

The Adult Authority does not hold

'Vt

its own fact-finding hearings.

It relies on the hearing

that was conducted in the prison and this is what means

37
that: the consequences of what happens at a disciplinary
hearing are very serious because the California Supreme
Court has held a single disciplinary infraction is
sufficient cause to deny parole or to rescind the parole
date which has previously been granted.
That is why the Supreme Court case in Rodrigues
mentioned by counsel doesn't make any difference because
when they set a tentative parol© date, they can then
rescind it on the basis of a disciplinary offense and
make a man serve a whole lot longer in prison as a result.
It is the difference between being paroled
next month and possibly five years from now when the
macimuxn sentence expires.
The indeterminate sentence has particular
relevance where the charge against the

man is criminal

in nature, where the — as in. Clutchette’s case, he was
charged with assault on an officer.

That is a fairly

heavy felony in California law.
In that kind of case, the state has an effective
option of how to deal with the man.
It can achieve further incarceration, additional
incarceration either by following through on the criminal
process or can do the very same thing through the Adult
Authority with far less procedural ceremony.
Summarily, they can make the man serve far

38

longer.
The issue to be tried , of course, in these
disciplinary proceedings, is the same issue that would be
tried in a criminal trial:

Did the man or not commit the

criminal act?
The courts below properly held that the San
Quentin procedure that was used when this case was
brought failed to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege.
This is because the man is faced with incurring
a very serious and immediate punishment if he doesn't
speak in his own defense.
He has no adequate alternative means of
defense besides speaking for himself.

At this time in

San Quentin he had no right to call for any yiLtnesses.
He couldn't cross-examine anybody.
He had no counsel-substitute.
own.

He had no counsel.

He was left wholly on his

The sole means of defending himself was to explain

his situation but how could he do that and also exercise
his Fifth Amendment privilege?
It is that dilemma that the Ninth Circuit
addressed itself to and of course, the dilemma is doubly
difficult fot the prisoner because he does not have the
advice of counsel.

There is nobody there to advise him

on the intricacies of the Fifth Amendment.
Whether there is any realistic risk of

39

prosecution as a result of this event, whether what he
wants to say might tend to incriminate him, and it is just
not accurate to say that prisoners at San Quentin can
routinely consult with counsel.
I have heard ofvery few San Quentin prisoners
who have access to counsel.

As this Court must recognize

of virtually all of them, they are indigent.

The only

reason Clutchette had counsel is because he was at this
time already under indictment for a felony, an in-prison
felony in California and that is the only reason he had
counsel and could consult with him.
So the situation facing the prisoner in these
disciplinary hearings is, either he has to forfeit his
only means of defensa, the right to speak in his own
behalf, or he has to waive the Fifth Amendment privilege.
This conflicts, we submit, with the line of
cases in this Court, most recently Lefkowitz, and the
earlier cases that say, a state cannot penalize the
exercise of the Fifth Amendment and cannot coerce people
to give incriminating testimony against themselves,,
It doesn't make any difference that formally
in this case the prisoner is not being punished for taking
the Fifth Amendment and it doesn't make any difference
whether or not there is an inference drawn from his
silence because he doesn't have any other means of

40
defending himself,
QUESTION:

in hefkowitz. if he didn't talk, he

would lose his job.
MR. TURNER:

That is right and here if he doesn't

talk he for sure gets the disciplinary punishment.

There

is really no doubt about it.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn't for being silent.

MR. TURNER:

No, it is not for being silent.

It is because of being silent because he has no other
defense but ■—
QUESTION:

Well, it is because of the. evidence

against him, isn't it?

It is not for being silent.

It

is because of what the evidence is against him.
MR. TURNER:

Well, the

question is whether he

is required to forfeit all defense, his only defense, and
whether due process can countenance that.
QUESTION:

Is it true that he had 14 affidavits

in this case, 14 written statements against him?
MR. TURNER',
QUESTION;

There were written statements filed,
Fifteen?

MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

I don't know how many there were.
Quite a few.

MR. TURNER:

He was not shown any of those

statements, of course.
QUESTION:

Yes, but there were quite a few so

41
it could be that they thought he was guilty? from those
statements.
HR. TURNER:

Ho doubt about that? as they do in

most cases but —~
QUESTION:

Without even considering the fact of

whether he testified or not.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

That is right.
Well? you talk about forfeiture.

Under your line of reasoning? isn't McGautha pretty much
against you?
MR. TURNER:
your Honor.

Well? it is not for this reason?

In McGautha the accused had the most elaborate

procedural protections known under our lav?.

He had a

lawyer, the presumption of innocence? the state required
to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, trial before a
jury drawn from a cross-section of the community.

His

counsel? as the Court went out of the way to say? could
do everything that the accused himself wanted to do in
the way of explaining mitigating circumstances to the jury.
QUESTION:

But he still had to decide whether to

take the stand or not.
MR. TURNER:

Oh? he had to make that choice but

the point is that if he made the choice to remain silent?
he was still not without means of defense whereas the
prisoner in the situation has nothing going for him other

42
than the right to speak in his own behalf»
Everybody agrees that due process says that you
have the opportunity to be heard in your own defense, but
you can31 have it here if you want to take the Fifth
Amendment.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

He can’t have it here because why?
Because he may be concerned about

protecting himself in a later criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

Well, what if —
If he wants to exercise his Fifth

Amendment privilege, that means he can’t defend himself
in the hearing.
QUESTION:

What if he just, wants to say, I just

want to point out to you some of the shortcomings in the
testimony of these other witnesses.
Is he prevented from doing that?

Does he then

open himself up for complete interrogation?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

I don't know.
Well, if the answer to that is no, I

would think there is not much to your argument.
MR. TURNER:

Wall, the point is that if he

doesn’t do something at the disciplinary hearing, he is
going to be punished by the tribunal

there and that

punishment may include an immediate dose of solitary
confinement, the other punishments that

are available in

43
California as well as an increased term of imprisonment
when the Adult Authority takes a look at it so he has got
to make up his mind right then and there whether he is
going to ~~
QUESTION:

Well* I know, but that argument would

mean that it wouldn't make any difference whether this
conduct is otherwise criminal or not.
MR. TURNER:

Well, the difference is because

of the Fifth Amendment.

He may not want to take the risk

of saying something that would —
QUESTION:

That would prejudice him in

this

disciplinary proceeding.
That is your argument now, apparently.

It isn't

just hi3 fear of some later criminal trial.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Well —
Surely you can't say that that isn't

covered by Wolff.
MR. TURNER:

No. but this case is different

from Wolff because of the possibility of criminal
prosecution and he has to do one of two things, either take,
the Fifth or defend
QUESTION:

himself.
How do you know there was no

possibility of future prosecution in Wolff?
MR. TURNER:

Well, I have been told that in the

district court the prisoners offered evidence that they

44
had been accused of things which could have been considered
crimes but as I understand it, it. was neither briefed nor
argued by any party here that there was a criminal
prosecution problem in the case and it is not adverted to
in the Court's decision in any way.
I suppose if I am wrong in my reading in Wolff
we'll find

out about it in the decision of this case but

I would suggest to the Coui/fc that the factors involved here
(

are so much different from Wolff, when you have the spectra
of a criminal prosecution and fully protecting the man’s
Fifth Amendment privilege.
QUESTION:
that the —-

Well, I understood the state to say

at least, in the California situation that

the man may at any time decide that he doesn’t want to
talk or to talk any more or he could leave.
MR. TURNER:

Well, I don’t think the record shows

©ns way or another on that.but even assuming that he could
walk away from it —
QUESTIONj

..

-*"■

Or assume that he can say, look, I

don’t want to talk any more.

. I have now said all that I

want to say.
MR. TURNER;

He is giving up any defense of a

disciplinary practice and he has to take the consequences
of that.
QUESTION:

But he may stop at any time.

Do you

45

think he can or not?
MR. TURNER:

Yes.

I have no reason to doubt,

that he can stop at any time but then suffer the
consequence of the disciplinary punishment.
QUESTION:

Is that fundamentally very much

different from the decision made by a defendant in a full
criminal case that he xtfill not take the stand after there
has been overwhelming evidence against him?
MR. TURNER:
factors are two:

Well, I think the distinguishing

It seems to make a

difference in the Court’s decision whether the —
QUESTION:

Which Court’s decision?

MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

This Court.
You mean, Wolff?

MR. TURNER:

Wolff and Lefkowitz and McGautha

and all of the decisions that deal with the various issues.
If the person is going to suffer serious consequences, that
may not make the difference but if he has no alternative
means of defending himself, that will.
That is, if the person is going to suffer
grievous harm if he doesn't defend himself and if there is
no other means of defending himself
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Now, when you say -— then there is -a serious problem.
When you say, if he does not defend

46
himself, do you mean if he does not speak?

Or do you

mean if he doesn't come in with a full scale effort to
meet the evidence of the other witnesses?
MR. TURNER:

I only meant to say speak because

that is all that the prisoner has going for him, at least
at the time this case was triadi his only means of defense.
He couldn't call any witnesses.

His only means of defense

was what he could say to explain away the charge.
QUESTION:
it up?

Well, tell me in detail, how he gives

Suppose the question is, suppose that he is

advised that he can be silent and that anything can be
used against him and he shrugs his shoulders and doesn't
say anything, so they ask him, they say, well, the simple
question is, did you beat up the guard or not?
Now, he s&ys, well, 1 decline to answer.
And they say, fine, do you want to answer any
other

questions?
And he says, no.
Now, how does he give up any defense?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

Well —
By declining to answer that question.
Well, because if he could — for

example, if his defense was, I was there but it was the
man next to me who hit the guard.
QUESTION:

Now, he doesn't give up any defense

47
by saying that, does he?
MR. TURNER:

No, but saying that he was there may

incriminate him in a criminal trial and it may be an
important piece of evidence.
QUESTION:

But he doesn’t give up his defense,

though.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

In the criminal trial.
Yes.

MR, TURNER:

That is right, he doesn't give

up any defense in the criminal trial.
QUESTION:

Nor in the disciplinary trial.

MR. TURNER:

Well if he refuses to answer the

question.
QUESTION:

But if he answers that he doesn’t

And by the way, do you know whether

give up.

there is any claim — there is no lav; that says if you lie
in one of these proceedings you are subject to perjury?
MR. TURNER:

No, I don’t believe so.

It is

not usually conducted under oath.
The issue before the Court has been somewhat
mischaracfcerized.

It is not whether counsel has to be

provided in these proceedings, it is whether some kind of
special precautions have to be taken because of the
collision of two constitutional rights.

48

QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

"Some kind/' meaning what?
Some kind of special precaution.

Well, the Ninth Circuit specified three.

First, it said

that the state can hold its own disciplinary proceedings.
Now, that is fine and do-able if the state is
! not wanting to impose segregation or some kind of
disciplinary-like punishment while the case is pending in
criminal court and that is many but definitely not all of
the cases.
In many of the cases the state is going to say
no, we don't want to wait until the criminal proceeding
is over.
Well, then the Ninth Circuit said yes, that the
i

state can hold a hearing and then it has the choice
between providing counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment
or providing use immunity.
■ Usd immunity is a very simple and workable
solution in these circumstances.

It would eliminate the

problem, essentially, because the man could testify
freely and what he says couldn't be used against him and
it would eliminate the need for counsel there.
But the Ninth Circuit, as I read the decision,
left it up to the state to make that choice.
QUESTION:

Would it be possible for them, if

they give him use—immunity, to couple with that a

49

-

requirement that all his statements be under oath and
subject to the penalties of perjury?
MR. TAYLOR:

The state dc it?

The state could

do that because it would then be openly compelling
testimony and can do so, so long as it immunizes the
QUESTION:

Well, .is there any difference —

is it any more or less compelling whether he is under
oath or not under oath?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

No, I don't think that makes —
The only difference is that in one

case he may be subject to criminal prosecution for
perjury, is it not?

And that might keep the whole pro­

ceeding on a track a little bit more.
MR. TAYLOR:

That is right.

That is right.

I

think it would be an excellent idea.
QUESTION:

When you spoke in response to Justice

White about his giving up something, if 14 witnesses have
placed him at the seen®, what do you suggest ha is giving
up when he responds?
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, in this case, the defense was

clearly going to be self-defense and he is giving up —
QUESTION:

Well, than, it wouldn’t incriminate

him just to say he was there.
MR. TAYLOR:

No, not in that case but to go any

step beyond that might get him in very deep trouble and

50
assaulting an officer in a California prison under the
California penal code is a very serious felony and he
shouldn't have put to that choice between either saying
nothing or giving up the Fifth Amendment.
This choice that the prisoner is confronted with
can’t, be postponed until the criminal trial to see whether
what he says might be admitted or might not be admitted
in evidence.

The constitutional violation occurs at the

hearing where he is required to forfeit one right or the
other.
QUESTION:

Well, would you say the constitutional

violation in a typical Miranda interrogation followed by
criminal trial occurs at the time of the interrogation or
only if the Court fails to exclude the evidence?
MR. TURNER;

Only at the trial, the criminal

trial.
QUESTION:

In other words, the defendant couldn't

get an injunction out of, perhaps, Judge ZirpoXi, to say
that you may not interrogate this man without giving him
Miranda warnings?
MR. TURNER;

No.

Not in an individual case.

That

would clearly be a matter for the state courts to deal
with on criminal prosecution.
There are several other issues in this case.
intend to touch only on the other major issue, which

I

51
involves the right: of confrontation or cross-examination»
And, of course, there was no such right at the
time this case was tried in California prisons.

What the

Ninth Circuit did in light of the decision in Wolff,
holding that there is no general right of cross-examination
but that this would be committed to the discretion of
prison officials, the Ninth Circuit simply prescribed a
method by which arbitrariness could be controlled and said
every

time you deny cross-examination, put your reason on

the record.
The Petitioners in this case have no quarrel
with the requirement that they record reasons for denying
cross-examination.

Their present plan does exactly that

and they have been living under that plan now for about
three and a half years.
What they do complain about is that the reasons
given authorized by the Ninth Circuit are not broad
enough.
QUESTION:

Well, that really stands Wolff on its

head, though, what the Ninth Circuit did, didn't it?

We

said that the general presumption is against cross-examina­
tion in Wolff and the Ninth Circuit comes along now and
says the presumption is in favor of cross-examination.
MR. TURNER:

Well, we don’t think that Wolff

can be read as a declaration by this Court that never in

52
any circumstances can there be a right of cross-examination.
QUESTION:

No, that wasn't my question because

I said I would read Wolff as saying there is a presumption,
against cross-examination and now along comes the Ninth
Circuit and says there is a presumption in favor of it.
Now, don't you think that is inconsistent with
Wolff?
MR. TURNER:

Well, X think it is inconsistent

with the spirit of Wolff.

QUESTION:

And then what business does the

Ninth Circuit have doing that on a remand for reconsi­
deration in the light of Wolff?
MS. TURNER:

Your Honor, it wasn't a remand.

The Court agreed itself to rehear it in light of Wolff.

QUESTION:
MR, TURNER:

Well, all right —
It is giving its own reading to

Wolff and every other court to address this issue since
Wolff has done the same thing.
QUESTION:

Well, what business do any of them

have then, if you say it is inconsistent with the spirit
of Wolff?
MR. TURNER:

I think the reason the courts are

doing that is because they read Wolff carefully and can
see that in Wolff — Nebraska, in fact, permitted a limited
right of cross-examination.

The prisoner was allowed to

53
meet with the charging party and then at the hearing
itself to ask the charging party questions so there was a
limited right of cross-examination in Wolff itself„
Then what the Court said that went beyond that
wasn't really necessary to the decision there but probably
more important than that —
QUESTION:

You mean, what the Court said in

Wolff wasn't necessary to a decision?
MR. TURNER:

If Wolff can be read as saying

there is never a right of cross-examination, that cer­
tainly would not have been necessary to a decision.
QUESTION:

Well, and do you think the Court of

Appeals are than free to say there is a right of crossexamination?
MR. TURNER:
said here, either.

No, and that is not what the Court

All they said is, do what the state

is doing now and that is, provide reasons so that you can
see whether the people are — whether the

officials are

dealing fairly with prisoners in these situations.
In Wolff, the district court in that case,
feeling itself bound by the then-existing Eighth Circuit
precedent, didn't take any evidence whatever on whether
a limited right of cross-examination is workable or that
problems might result if it were used.
We think that this is a matter that is susceptible

54
of proof and in the district court in this case before
the district court gives final approval to any rules, there
ought to be an opportunity to take testimony on these
problems because after all, a large number of states, 28
states according to the ABA survey, implement some kind of
cross-examination rights, some kind of confrontation.
QUESTION:

But that should be permissible only

if Wolff left it open.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

That is right.
And you really, when you say it is

contrary to the spirit of Wolff, I gather, you said at
least you thought it didn't think it left it open,
MR. TURNER:

Well, no, I certainly think that

what the Ninth Circuit did was proper in this case.

That

decision ought to be affirmed so that the case can go back
down to the district court finally to dispose of what due
process requires in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Turner, I want to come back to

the first point you argued.

1 am looking at the question

number one in your brief and you end up by saying that
there must be a hearing that protects the Fifth Amendment
privilege of the inmate.
The question as phrased in the brief of the
Attorney General of California states that specifically in
terms of the requirement of counsel to be present.

Do

55

you go beyond that?
MR. TURNER:

No, we don’t go that far, Mr. Jus­

tice Powell, we *—
QUESTION:

What exactly do you say is required

by the Constitution?
MR. TURNER:

That the Ninth Circuit gave the

state options —* three options of dealing with the
situation, providing special precautions at the hearing.
One, is the postponement hearing until you see
whether the district attorney is going to prosecute or
until the trial is concluded.

That obviously eliminates

the problem except when the state wants to take immediate
action.

And it may well be able to live with the post­

ponement in many cases but where it wants to take
immediate action and hold a hearing, then there are two
options — either counsel or use-immunity and the Ninth
Circuit would permit either one.
That is why the issue is before this Court.

It

is not simply whether counsel has to be provided.
QUESTION:

And these three options apply only

where the misconduct also constitutes a crime.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:
may.

That is correct, your Honor.
Well, not where it does, but where it

Isn't that the qualification?

to criminal prosecution.

Or it may be subject

MR. TURNER;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Steinf you have

just a few minutes — two minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DOUGLAS STEIN, ESQ.
*

MR. STEIN;

Mr. Turner correctly pointed out,

the Ninth Circuit did provide us with three options but
in reality they boiled down to just the one of counsel, I
submit.

Both parties are — postponement is unacceptable

to both parties.
We have been accused in the circuit court and in
the district court of doing, under the term ''classification"
what the district court and the Ninth Circuit said v?e
couldn't do, discipline.
We don't want to postpone these things.
In our plans for all cases other than these that
involve criminal, we try and get this over in 72 hours.
That is the 'way to maintain discipline in state prisons,
not with postponement.
We postpone these major conditions, these major
c.ises and we h&ve to confine the man under some imposed
conditions, restrict his freedom to move about and we are
accused of doing by subversion what we can't do directly.
Use-immunity — there is not -- really, I don't
see anything as use“immunity, your Honors.

It seems to me

what we are talking about is the traditional theories and

57
notions of voluntariness of confessions, which is black
letter law all down the books»
If the man is compelled to make a statement,
then some sort of use-immunity is required but that is not,
use-immunity is nothing new.

That use-immunity is the

trial court's hearing under Johnson v. Avery on the
voluntariness of the statement that was made.
We agree, as anyone must that looks at this
thing, that the prisoner faces a difficult choice.

There

is no question about that.
But what is counsel going to do for him?

What

role has counsel — we have been talking about counsel.
What role do you see him to play here?

He is a mare

advisor, apparently.
QUESTION:

Now, why do you agree *— what is the

difficult, choice that counsel faces?
MR. STEIN:

Okay, he faces a difficult choice.

If he can make some sort of pitch to the disciplinary board
that might get him out of the discipline.
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN :

Right.

>

But he might incriminate himself in

a trial court.
QUESTION:

Well, why would it?

If it is going

to get him out of a disciplinary infraction, why would it
get

him into a criminal offense?

58

MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, he — I assume that —
Based upon the same charge, you mean,

the same transaction.
MR. STEIN:

He might make a statement the

prosecutor could use later as a prior inconsistent state­
ment or something like that.

He is certainly not going to

confess to a criminal charge as a way of getting out of it.
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

No, he isn’t, is he?
No.
And that is not going to help him.
No, that's not.
And the only thing he is going to say,

presumably in the disciplinary proceeding is something
that he thinks is going to help him.
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

He thinks will help him.
That is probably not going to be

incriminating, is it?
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

Probably not directly.
So why is it so inevitably such a

difficult choice?
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION s

Perhaps you have conceded too much

on this.
MR. STEIN;

Perhaps we have missed —

Perhaps we have misconstrued all

59
I thank your Honors for your time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:06 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
