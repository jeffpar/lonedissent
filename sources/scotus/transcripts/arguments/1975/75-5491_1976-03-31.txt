MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will tear arguments

next in 5491, Woodson and Waxton against North Carolina»
Mr. Amsterdam, you may proceed whenever you are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. AMSTERDAM;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

If I may, before beginning the presentation of

the argument in the Woodson and Waxton case, simply speak
to three questions that cam© up in the previous questioning,
and specifically questions asked by Mr. Justice Stewart and
Mr. Justice White about the Louisiana practice and the
California Practice.
Tk@ mystery about the Louisiana practice is no
mystery at all.

It is explicated at page 33, footnote 45,

of our brief in Roberts♦

The Louisiana Supreme Court doss

not review sufficiency of the'evidence.

It does us© a no-

evidence test to review sufficiency akin to the Thompson v.
Louisville -test.

Whether a new trial motion is filed or not,

there is not a question whether the evidence is sufficient to
support the — it's a no-evidence test.

Thar© isn’t a great

mystery about it, it’s just that -they don't review sufficiency
in the normal way.
QUESTION;

What about the motion for new trial?

MR. AMSTERDAM;

It doesn’t make any difference --

4
OUESTXOHs I know, but:what about in the trial court
on the motion for new trial?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

Sam® standard, no-"evidence standard,

not a sufficiency standard»
Th® second question had to do with the California
practice.
QUESTION:

If you took that literally, Mr, Amsterdam,

that puts a trial judge into rather a tight corner, doesn't
it, to say that having let the case go to the jury in th©
first place with instructions, he now is called upon in a
motion for' new trial to decide that there was no evidence to
go to th© jury»

That's a little different from a sufficiency test

is it not?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I think it amounts to nothing more

or lass than th® difference between the Thompson v. Louisville
constitutional no-evidence test and the standard State
sufficiency test.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting, then, that th® gloss

on their literal test is that it makes it a sufficiency test.
Is that it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I think that Louisiana law operationally

differs from the law in other States in that neither th© trial
judg© nor the appellate court exercises th© degree of
scrutiny over th© evidence and over th© jury that exists in
other States.

‘That's a matter of degree.

5
Tim question that Mr. Justice Stewart asked about.
California practice, the reason that they hav© two stages in
California is that some of the special circumstances may not
come put at the guilt phase.

For example, if the defendant

committed an translated murder, that0s on© of the special
circumstances.
Another reason for the second phase is that at the
first phase the jury may not resolve all of the relevant
issues, for example, a case is punishable by death in
California if it is first degree murder.

It is first degree

murder if it is either premiditated and deliberated or a felony
murder.

So what goes to the jury is an alternative submission

premeditation and deliberation or a felony murder.

Then they

come back at the penalty stag© and even if there is no new
evidence presented, they now have to answer both, questions
cumulatively.

Ibid the answer to how they do that is very
*

interesting, because in fact, as Mr. Justice White's question
suggested, there are juries, and they have don® it again and
again, who have com® back at the second phase

with a-life-

scaring verdict that is inconsistent with their verdict at
first stage.

Cold-blooded murders where the defendant's

contention was an alibi where there is ap doubt of the facts
of the ease that the person, whoever he was who committed the
crime, intentionally premeditatively and daliberatively committed
a killing in the course of a robbery, the jury then goes ahead

6
and finds the defendant guilty, and then it is asked the
question at the penalty phase,

bid the defendant pramedita-

tively and deliberatively kill'during the course of a felony,
and it comes back, No, and spares the defendant's life.
Now, th® third question that came up on the previous
arguments that I would just like to mention, Mr. Justice
Powell, is we do deal in our reply brief, at pages 3 to 6,
with the question of th® homicide rate figures about which
your Honor asked, and I hop© that th© Court would look at our
reply brief's treatment of that subject.
QUESTIONS

What page is that?

MR. AMSTERDAM!
QUESTION s

Pardon me?

What page?

MR. AMSTERDAM;

Pages 3 to 6 of tli® reply brief.

And the homicide rat® has in fact showed a decrease last year
for the first time.

But we deal more generally with those

figures in the reply brief.
Now, if I may, I said yesterday that th© petitioners
in the Texas and Louisiana cases made two separate constitu­
tional contentions against their- sentences of death.

Both, of

those contentions ar© also mad© by the. petitioners in this
present North Carolina case.

Yesterday I spent all of ray

time talking about th® first of thos® two issu®s.

Today I

would like to devote most of my tiro© talking about th® second.
In order to begin that, however, I would like to

7

i '
■■'simply summarise? recapitulate? the essence of the first

argument in order to distinguish it from the second? because
although both arguments depend upon characteristics of
imposition of the death penalty under the present system?
including its rarity
different arguments.

and arbitrariness?

they are very

I think it's important to state them

succinctly.
N .

Our first argument? then? is based square upon

Furman v. Georgia.

The predicate of the argument is

arbitrary selectivity in the administration of th© dealth
penalty.

It is not mere selectivity as such.

It is

arbitrary selectivity? by which I mean that certain persons
are consigned to die and others are spared? call it mercy
if you will? as the Government puts it? but other people in
like situations are spared with no meaningful basis to
distinguish between them.

That is an 8fch Amendment argument?

it is not a due process argument? because the 8th Amendment?
unlike the due process clause? is not concerned with process?
it is concerned with the result of process.

The 8th

Amendment is concerned with punishment? it asks whether
punishment is cruel or unusual.

And punishment may be cruel

and unusual even though? as Mr. Justice Stevens asked? the
results in a particular case of the process are fair simply
looking at that case in isolation.
The 8th amendment question is whether the result

8
of that process, whether fair or not-

in isolation,is in the

perspective of all of the punishments meted out by the system
nevertheless a cruel and unusual punishment.

Mow, that is

why Furman is consistent with McGautha and that is why Furman
is not limited to jury discretion.
The Government suggests in its brief that another
way to run a system of selecting people to die would be a
lottery, that is, if all people convicted of first degree
murder were in a lottery and you only kill some of them.

It

is our contention that Furman would outlaw that just as much
as it outlawed th© jury discretionary systems involved in
Furman, and it is our position that Furman, outlaws the present
systems before th© Court in these five cases, because

th©

results are no batter than a lottery.
QUESTION:

If you accept McGautha, are you not also

accepting the fact that standardless exercise of jury discretion
is something different- from a lottery?

Or doesn*t McGautha

hold that?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Mo, no, no.

I think that. McGautha

says — Mr. Justice Stevens, I am not sure that. McGautha does
say that.

I5m not sure -that McGautha addresses th© question

whether a lottery is unconstitutional.

It may well be that

McGautha is based on precisely the notion, as the Government
suggests, -chat the State can chocs® any way it sees fit as a
matter of due process rather than cruel or unusual punishment.

s
QUESTION:
then»

Let ra® put the question a little differently

Is your argument predicated on th® proposition that

standardless discretion is equivalent to a lottery?

The

Solicitor General takes precisely the opposite position on
that.

He says discretion is not necessarily capricious.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

For 8fch Amendment purposes standardless

discretion is equivalent to a lottery, and for 8th Amendment
purposes it would b® equivalent to a system in which a
prosecutor before trial simply could decide to paper th© case
capitally or not capitally, as h® chose.
Our point is that the 8th Amendment is not concerned
with the way the decision is made? it is concerned with whether
at the end of the tunnel you look at it and you say, these
people ar© dying like being struck by lightning, and these
people are living, and there is no actual basis for it.

And
1

*

whichever procedure -QUESTION:

And further, it is not a rational basis

that a jury of 12 people differentiated.

On© jury of 12 peopl©

found that, this group should die and another group found that
they should not.

That is not a rational basis for —

MR. AMSTERDAM:

No, it is not.

The fact is that

each individual jury may come in with different standards,
different approaches.

There is no way to rationalis© a system

like that.
Now, our second argument, though, is different.

Our

10
second argument,, a safe square one, does not depend on Furman.
It would be the same whether Furman had been decided or not.
The second argument is that the death penalty is an adevistic
butchery which has run its course.
Now, I listened yesterday to the argument of the
Attorney General of Texas, and there is something extraordinarily
striking about this.

The Attorney General of Texas said

yesterday, “Look at what we use the death penalty for now.
We only use it for this limited class of highly serious
murders.

We don't use it for all murders any more, we don't

use it for rape.”
The respondent's brief in Florida says, "Look at the
way we use the death penalty now.

We use it for a broader

range than Texas does, but we have got standards.
use it the way it was used before Furman„"

We don't

They say it is

not surprising that sentences determined under the system
condemned by Furman produce uninformed, irrational, and
freakish results„
What are we talking about?

We are talking about the

way of killing people that was argued for by these very same
States in this Court five years ago.

We are talking about

penalties for which they were killing people 10 years

ago, we

are talking about penalties for which 15 years ago they were
killing 20 people a year, and in the 1930*s they were killing 200
people a year, and we are now

told that it is no surprise

II
that they were found to b@ irrational and arbitrary and
uninformed.,

And what will w® be told 10 years from now if the

Court sustains these death penalties and w® find the system
working in a predictable and expectable way?
outgrown these death penalties?

That w© hav©

That these death penalties

ar® equally purposeless and in vain?
Our argument * our second argument, which does not
depend on Furman places the death penalty in its historical
perspective.

These now death penalties that we ar® having

urged on us that the Solicitor General is seeking to sustain
ar® either, just exactly like Furman, that is, th© aggravating,
mitigating circumstances which amount to a process that is
ultimately totally discretionary and uncontrolled, or else
they ar© reversions, they are rollbacks, to the old mandatory
death penalty system.
Now, th© mandatory death penalty system was repudiated
in -this country because it was intolerable, because mandatory
death penalties for crimes were intolerable and because juries
would not convict.
QUESTIONz

And so what happened was —
Mr. Amsterdam, I thought I said that in

my dissent in Furman, precisely that.
MR. AMSTERDAMs

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think you

Of course, on® doesn't read dissents

anyway, but th® argument you ar© just making, you know as a

12
professor that when counsel lose one case * they coxa© up in th®
next one and distinguish it.

This, I don't believe, is

deserving of logical inconsistency necessarily, is it?
MR. AMSTERDAM;
is quite a difference.

Mr. Justice Blackman, I think there
I think that when w© are now told that

th® system under which hundreds of people were put to death
was arbitrary and uninformed and irrational, that it is quit®

V- '

an important consideration in whether we should permit a new
round of those kinds of killings to begin.

Yes, I think that

is a vary important consideration.
QUESTION;

Of course, when they mad© that statement,

they were quoting a minority of th© Court, they were adopting
a position expressed by a combination of th© plurality of opiniosi
plus two concurring opinions, were they not?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

I suppos® if Furman is rejected,

then 'the concession that th© States ar© now making based on
Furman would have to b© rejected, as well.
QUESTION;

Well, I say again, as I said yesterday,

hasr/t your Furman result prompted this kind of thing which
you ar© now so seriously complaining about?
MR. AMSTERDAMs
on.

We have a dialectic process going

Ther© is no doubt that the States have responded to

Furman, but Furman itself responded to what went before .—
mandatory capital punishments found unacceptable by the people
cf th® country and unacceptable by th© legislatures.

QUESTION:

So

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Absolutely.

capital'punishments put in ia their place- and then
happened?

Discretionary
what

What happened was that when given discretion, the

systems of American criminal justice so thoroughly repudiated
the death penalty that in 1967, for example, th© National
Crime Commission

concluded that the most salient characteris­

tic of capital punishment was that it was infrequently usad.
This Court than, as a result of that, and I do not
think wrongly, held in Furman v. Georgia that that kind of
application of th® death penalty violated the Constitution.
And now, indeed, th© States have responded, but how have they
responded?

They have responded either by maintaining the old

discretionary outlets in a new form for wholesale invasion of
the us© of th© death penalty," or enacting so-called mandatory
death penalty schemes in a procedural setting where in fact
all these escape■hatches exist — prosecutorial discretion,
et cetera.
Now, let me just point out that for our second
argument the existence of discretion and escape hatches and
arbitrariness in the selective system is not relevant because
of Furman.

It is relevant because it explains why and how

new statutes can foa enacted without a considered judgment ‘that
th® death penalty ought to be used in the regular and ©ven-

QUESTION;

Mr. Amsterdam, would you argue for

abolishing the jury system in criminal cases because it -produces
some irrational results sometimes in acquittals?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

No, not at all.

And that’s what I5m

saying ■—
QUESTION:
now, that we should

That’s the essence of what you ar© arguing
abolish the whole system of punishment

because it works irrationally sometimes.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Not at all, and I am trying vary

hard, Mr. Chief Justice, to distinguish the due process
argument

which is still ~~
QUESTION:

You would concede that fh© jury system

does work irrationally sometimes in criminal cases as well as

16

others.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Indeed.

Indeed.

Indead, there is

a looseness throughout th© entire system — prosecutorial
discretion, jury discretion, throughout th© entire system*
which may work irrational results.
Th® question in these cases is whether what is good
enough for meting out remediable punishments* punishments that
are within th© realm of the knowabl© and the curable is also
good enough for meting out the punishment of life and death..
Furman said no.
QUESTION:

Your argument is that death is different.

This is where you must end up* as yesterday when Mr. Justice
Stewart asked you 'th© question* and your answer has to b©
that death, is different.

And if it isn't different, you have

to lose.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

That is absolutely correct.

If death

is not different, w© lose on ©very argument we hav® got.
QUESTION:

If on® wanted to argue retribution, on©

could say that the victims hav© already lost.
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

What did you say?

I say if one wanted to argue retribution,

one could say that the victims whom you n@ver mention hav®
already lost.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

If on® wanted to argu© that th®

system of killing Woodson and not Tucker and Carroll was

17
retributive, yes, but there is no rational retributive justifi­
cation for killing the people who are killed.

As you inspect

each of the justifications put forward for the death penalty
crmables in the face of the facts.

The Morth Carolina

legislature has said that everybody who is guilty of first
degree murder shall be killed.
they don't.

Now, either they mean it or

If th© justification is retribution, then Tucker

and Carroll and Woodson and Waxton all of them ought to be
dead.
QUESTIONS

I guess you missed my point.

I mentioned

victims of the four defendants.
MR. AMSTERDAMs
QUESTION:

Yes.

Victims ar© unquestionably --

Bead.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

~ dead.

But I am not sure — it

seems that something must follow from that in terms of why
th© defendants ought to b© dead, or more particularly in,this
eas© why two of them ought to be dead and two of them ought to be
/

alive.

That's the great problem we are putting our finger on,

that when this Court is told that legislative judgments ar®
involved and the Court ought to defer to legislative judgments,
legislatures are deciding what particular persons get killed.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Amsterdam, may I ask you a question

getting back to the discussion you were just having with Mr.
Justice Blackmun?

You were talking about the fact that on®

parson who has committed murder may receive capital punishment

18
while 8 or 10 or 20 escape it.

Let me ask you about the

Federal statute that imposes tlm death penalty only for air
piracy that results in death, and that death on a 747 could be
350 people.

It doesn't occur very often,, fortunately.

You

wouldn't have the same argument there, would you, because
there wouldn't be a Peter, Paul, John, James,
these other people you have been talking about.

or Henry and
There might

be a half a dozen in the course of a year who committed air
piracy.

Do you male© the same arguments against th© Federal

statuta that you do against th© Month Carolina statute?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
but I think

I would not makes th® same arguraant,

the Federal statute is subject to attack in

that it does nevertheless permit, even within a defined range ■
this statute, as I tried to explain to Mr. Justice Stevens
on yesterday, I think that one can argue both ways about
whether the narrowing of the statute cures the Furman problem
so .Long as discretion remains within the facts framed by
th© statute to sentence to lif® or death.

On th® on® hand,

the narrower tha statute, th® less broad th® rang® of play for
discretion.

On the other hand, the narrower you mak® th©

statute, the mor© alike, as your Honor points out, the people
within -tha class ar© and the more arbitrary, therefore, it is
to distinguish among instead of treating them all the same.
Mow, I just think it's pr@mat.ur© to anticipate until
we see the specific statute in question —

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

B©£or© you go on, let m® pursue that just

a stap further.
Can you conceive of any crime as to which you would
consider the death penalty an appropriate response by society?

20
MR- AMSTERDAM:
QUESTIONS

No.

Well, let me put a cas© to you.

You've

heard about Buchenwald, one of -the camps in Germany in which
thousands of Jewish citizens were exterminated.

It's unthink­

able that that could happen again, but who would have thought
it would have happened in the 20th century in a country as
civilized as Germany was supposed to foe.

If wa had had

jurisdiction over the commandant of Buchenwald, would you
have thought capital punishment was an appropriate response
to what that man or woman was responsible for?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

If that happened in the United

States with a Constitution with an 8th Amendment against the
background of the history we have had, generally I can't
answer that question.

I think I probably would respond the

same way all the human beings to the kinds of atrocities that
your Honor is raising.
that says,

We all have an instinctive reaction

aKiXl him.K
But I think th© answer to the question that your

Honor is raising, would that crime or any other crime be
consistent with th© 8th Amendment to the Constitution of th®
which
United States against aha history/ this Court must now apply
that amendment at this point in time, my answer would foe, "Mo."
That's the. second of our two arguments, not the first.
th® second, and the answer is categorically, “No.”
QUESTION:

So if today some fanatic sat off a

the appropriate remedy for that would ba to put him in prison*
perhaps out ©n parole in seven years?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

Mr. Justice Powell, there is no

question in my mind that the State must have and it does have
ample remedies against people who are going to set off
hydrogen bombs.
QUESTION:

For example,

MR. AMSTERDAM;
is not

There is simply no doubt that h©

fch© question of whether to let him out in seven

years ©r not is a totally different question than whether to
kill him.
QUESTION;

Would you b@ willing to put him in

prison in solitary confinement for life with no parol®?
Solitary confinement?
MR. AMSTERDAM;

The question of life in prison

without parol® is also not before the Court.

I think that

under certain limited circumstances it may b@ permissible to
incarcerate somebody — it seamsj to me w® ar© now getting
constitutional and normative questions mixed up.

1 see n©

constitutional objection at ail for lif© imprisonment without
parol®.

As far as the normative provision goes* I don’t

think it5s a wise thing, but I'm not sure that this Court is
called upon to raak© those kinds of judgments.
QUESTION;

But you are foreclosing altogether the us©

22
of capital punishment under any and all circumstances, and
society must have some effective alternative to protect people.
And I am asking you what you think it could be.
MR. AMSTERDAM!

Life imprisonment without possibility

MR. AMSTERDAM!

The way you prevent children from hurting

themselves on sharp objects, you put the sharp objects out
of reach.

You don't punish them -— I mean, you don't

raly exclusively on punishment for picking up sharp objects.
You manage prisons batter. You build in securities.
QUESTION:

I am asking you, Professor Amsterdam,

what you think is constitutionally valid.

Would you think -fee

type of punishment that .1 have just suggested would b®
constitutionally valid?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Aren't there many, many arguments that

are exactly tea same ones teat have been presented to us in
this cas@ that total lif® imprisonment and solitary confinement

23
is a more cruel punishment and a more unusual punishment than
death?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

It is neither, Mr. Justice Burger,

and not only do my clients, but everybody on death row
appreciates the difference.

I think there is a difference

between death and imprisonment.
QUESTION:

That wouldn't foreclose you from making

the argument 15ve just made, and I suspect it would be made
that that, is mor© cruel.
MR.AMSTERDAM:

It is possible, but it would certainly

be rather easy, I think, for this Court to write an opinion
that said death is different and make the attorneys who would
bring those arguments up feel rather embarrassed about doing
so, including myself.

Mr. Eagles.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY S. EAGLES, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. EAGLES:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

Several problems which I have with some of the

statements by Mr. Amsterdam move me to depart from my...earliar
notions of how I would proceed in order to put to rest a
couple of questions which he may have raised in the minds
of the Court, not in min©, but perhaps in yours.
As I understood a statement by Mr. Amsterdam and
perhaps I misunderstood it, he said that in capital cases the
jury system cannot be mad® rational.
Respondent disputes that.

I dispute that.

Capital punishment does not affect

til© operation of the jury system except to make our jurors
even more sensitive to their constitutional and sworn
responsibilities.

If the jury system is not rational and

sometimes there are cases in which its. results on the cold
record seem not rational, ©van so it is .the best.system
known to man, it is deeply engrained in our constitutional
system, and until a better alternative conies along,
respondent urges that petitioner^ have no right to complain.
As I understood Mr. Amsterdam's argument, he indicated
that tli© mandatory death penalty had been repudiated, and I
was not paying as clos© attention as I might have, perhaps,
and I am not sure whether h© said by this Court or by the people.

25
I suggest that in either ©vent*, it has not v©t been repudiated
by this Court, but two members of the Court in Furman
indicated a preference in that direction, and the people, at
least the people of North Carolina, the respondent State, have
acted definitely to guarantee a mandatory death penalty in a
limited series of cases, and I will talk mor© about that at
an appropriate time.

All the States have responded, however,

to your decision in Furman to assure that in 'dios® States,
in 35-odd States, I understand 36 in July, that there will fo@
the light in limited cases to bring forward the ultimat®
sanction of our criminal justics system, the' death penalty,
for the ultimate crimes, th© ultimat® crimes which present a
thread, if you will, to our system of government and to -th©
people of our country.
I say that in this respect, may it pleas© the
Court, that our people are governed by their consent.

The
«

Preamble to th© Constitution establishes purposes, including
which maintenance of domestic tranquility.

Now, perhaps

for -those of us who are fortunate, domestic tranquility
prevails, but for the victim in this crime, there is no
domestic tranquility.

There is nothing, brains have been

blown out by a small caliber pistol at close rang® for no
reason except to eliminat® a witness.

That's th© only

possible logical reason that you can imagine.

There was no

resistance, she was an elderly woman of 50-odd years.

These

26
are young strong men, and they just killed h©r.

Thara has

to fo© a sanction to that kind of treatment.
The assertion by Mr. Amsterdam that Woodson is the
least culpable defies my comprehension.

Much of his argument

has from time to time, but I attribute that to my limitation
rather than to him.

Woodson was outside with a rifle sitting

in the car standing watch.

According feo the testimony of the

other man in the car, Carroll, h© was about to get out and
shoot Stancil if h@ hadnst pulled him back into the car, a
fortuitous happenstance, may it pleas© the Court, a lucky
break, as we say on the street, that Stancil wasn't shot
with a rifle out front instead of merely wounded.
Mr. Amsterdam asked what purpose is served by the
trial and. by the death penalty in these two cases.

Well, the

purpose is retribution, specific deterrence, and other purposes
which have been

discussed.

QUESTION:

Mr. Eagles, is there any significance in

the ages of these four men and fcha differences in those ages?
Ara I correct — perhaps I am not

the two who did not

receive the death penalty were the youngest of the four?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

The two who did not r®c®iv© feh©

death penalty were not only the younger two of the four, your
Honor, but they were the least experienced as far as their
background want.

Si© two who were her© had been, by their

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1 p.m.)
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Eagles, you may

Continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY S. EAGLES, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT (RESUMED)
MR. EAGLES:

Thank you, your Honor.

The remaining point that I wanted to clarify before
beginning on what I was prepared to say has to do with the
reasons, the rationale behind two of these men being tried
and two being permitted to plead, and that is the necessity
of meeting the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in
order to convict.

Without the testimony of at least one

witness, and in this case sine© it could easily hav© bean
three against on®, or on© against an absanc© of any evidence
on the other side, not meeting the burden, the State was
required to make so» sort of a deal, some sort of a plea
bargain in order to be able to prove and meet its proper
constitutional burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Now, in this particular case, there is no proper
basis for complaint on the part of th® petitioner Woodson
that he was not permitted to plead because he never tried to.
His lawyer, according to th® records, had enterod into
negotiations

and had promised that h© would make some

29
recommendations to his client, an.d the prosecutor anticipated
the plea, but one never was forthcoming»

It was his decision,

certainly not a requirebant of constitutional law that he be
compelled to plead»
In til© case of Waxton, he was the triggerman, and he
was probably the dominant individual in the entire plan»

He

was the one who actually pulled the trigger, according to the
testimony of three of the four, and he, of course, said it
was his colleague Tucker who was with him, and even if that
had been true, under North Carolina law, he would have been
guilty as a principal»
The practicality of conviction, however, leads us to
require that the prosecutor fa® able to make the necessary
bargain with those that he in his judgment, pursuant to his
sworn oath, his experience, and his training, determines are
those -who he can make a deal with, who will be willing to
testify for the State for conviction»

Without a conviction, of

course, all is for naught.
This is, of course, may it pleas® the Court, not a
package store situation in the context that I understand
package stores today, this was a convenience market,a small
grocery store ox the S @ven-E1ev an quick-mart type»

This woman

was alone in the store, the* men came in, asked for cigarettes,
and one of them, without any resistance on her part., put a
pistol to her head and shot, her»

They seized the money and

30

ran out.

They shot another man coming in.

They were tried,

first degree murder under th© felony murder rule in North
Carolina, since it was pursuant to a robbery, and they were
convicted.

At that point there is absolutely no discretion on

the part of th© trial judge under North Carolina law.

He

sentenced them to th© death sentence, as h© was entitled to
and ha was required to.
The convictions were unanimously affirmed, unanimously,
not a single dissexyfcirsg vote,in the Supreme Court of North
Carolina.

Tha same court had in Waddell split 4 to 3.

there, however,

our

Even

. Supreme Court to a person stated that

they had no problem with any constitutional infirmities of
capital punishment per se.

We urge that is a wise decision.

We urge that to you.
As we read the petitioners' briefs, they have not
assarted, as we read them, any equal protection clause or any
"as applied" clause, "as appliedprovisions of th© law.

They

address themselves to tha presence or the existence of the
institutions as presenting a form of discretion which is
impermissihla.
QUESTION:

Before you proceed, may I interrupt you to

ask, what ware th© claims made in tha Supreme Court of the
State by the petitioners?
MR. EAGLESs
the

They urged the unconstitutionality of

death penalty, your Honor, and a world of questions

31

but I won’t spell them out at this time, because they were
all disposed of.

The court went through in this case*

examined the record as it does in ©very capital case, those
exceptions and objections brought forward and those that are
abandoned; if they appear to the court to b© worthy of
attention, the court on its own motion considers them.

In

this particular case, my recollection is that the primary
thrust was the statement that had been made by Woodson whether
or not that was admissible, and there was perhaps some other
question I just don't recall at this time.

The primary

thrust, though, in that court at that time was the attack on
the felony murder rule as being a way of approaching the death
penalty and the death penalty per se.
QUESTIONi

Does your supreme court have power to

review th@ sentence in any way as such?
MR. EAGLES;

As such, your Honor, no.

However, it

would be less than candid to say that our court does not treat
capital cases in a special way.
case.

They examine every capital

There is an automatic appeal to our supreme court, every

case comes up without regard to ‘the diligence or competence
or anything else of th© lawyers, and I certainly don't mean to
imply anything here, these ar@ able lawyers.
those that are brought forward.

They review them,

In Jarrette, as I recall th®

opinion, Mr. Justice Lake pointed out that they had been back
over 50-“Odd exceptions that th® appellant's counsel had

32
abandoned and still found there was no basis»
But as to sentence itself, there is no way -that our
court can say, CTrfhis case doss not deserv® a death sentence,
it gets life sentence»"

You either buy the conviction, you

find that there is a sufficiency of evidence, or that there
was a constitutional error of some form, or that there was an
?

insufficiency of evidence, that the nonsuit question as a
matter of law should have been granted»

In that case it goes

back for retrial, but they can’t adjust the sentence at that
time»
QUESTION?

Nor, I gather from what you just said,

your supreme court cannot reduce th© degree of the offense and
than affirm the conviction, say, of second-degree murder on
its own.
MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
It can, however, find that the evidence

was insufficient to support a verdict of guilt to first-degree
murder and then remand it for a new trial, remand the case
for a new trial?
MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION:
MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION:
MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION;

You say insufficiency, your Honor?
Yes.
Y®s, they could do that.
And remand the cas© for a new trial?
Yes, sir.
And then on the new trial, th® charge

33

would be second-degree murder and the lesser included
offenses?
MR. EAGLES;
QUESTION;
MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION:
MR. EAGLES:

No, sir, I don9t think so.
It would be first-degree murder.
Yes, sir.
And the lesser included offenses.
Yes, sir, that is my understanding of

the law as I understand it in this particular situation.
Hero we have a situation where the thrust, as we
perceive it, is that first, on the one hand, and the North
Carolina situation is on® where our General Assembly, our
legislature, acted in what it deemed the safest way in response
to honorable Court8s decision in Furman, wisely or unwisely,
and we urge that wisdom is not the question here, constitu­
tionality is the question.

But wisely or unwisely, they

reacted to this Court0s decision in Furman in such a way
as to say in order to guarantee the protection to our
citizens that a death penalty will have for certain crimes,
we will reduce -the scope of the crime to which it is
applicable but make it mandatory, and that was their answer,
not being willing to second guess this Court as to what degree
of discretion or judgment after sentence might or might not
be permissible.
In doing that, they reduced the number of crimes
from four to two, and the one other than murder is rape, and

34

it is first-degree rape, which is a new type of rape and
involves serious bodily injury or deadly weapon or under age
victim and an older rapist.

Th© first-degree situation,

however, is th© same as it was except that, the punishment is
mandatory.
One point which is mad® here as we perceive it from
petitioners: brief is that there is an arbitrariness, and in
the older cases they seem to say that its

arbitrariness

results from the fewness or the paucity of cases in which ‘th©
death penalty is actually levied.

To be sur©, that is not

a viable argument of the North Carolina situation, to b® sure.
QUESTION?

Mr. Eagles, let me just ask on the change

that the xiew statut® mad© in North Carolina practice.

Th©

appendix to the petitioners8 brief lists I think some 63
cases in which th© defendant is under death penalty,
MR. EAGLESs
QUESTIONS

Yes.
That seems to be a somewhat larger

number than is true in other States.

Would it be your

judgment that the kind of overall impact of the change in the
statutory scheme has been to increase rather than to decrease
th© imposition of the death penalty in North Carolina?
MR. EAGLES:

It would be my judgment, your Honor,

that it has resulted in an increase.
QUESTION:
get that clear.

That's my impression.

I just wanted to

35

MR» EAGLESs

And we have today in death row 106»

We had 10?, your Honor, we said so in our brief, and at that
time was true, but last week a superior court judge acting
pursuant to authorization from the General Assembly reviewed
the conviction of a hiack man for rap© and found that it fit
the criteria for second-degree murder --QUESTIOH:
MR» EAGLES:

Second-degree rape»
Second“degree rape, and reduced it»

However, it will soon be 107 because Saturday night a jury
cam© in with a white residential construction executive who
had contracted to murder his wife and found him guilty of
first-degree murder, and h© just hasn*t reached central
prison yet, but, it is at 107 at this time»
QUESTION:

Now I have a little problem.

You said

the court can’t reduce it in murder, but it can reduce it
in raps?
QUESTION:
MR. EAGLES:

There is a special provision ■—
There is a special statutory provision,

Mr. Justice Marshall, which providos in th© limited number o£
■cases where an individual has been convicted since Waddell
of rap© in th® first degree, there is a statutory provision
that provides for post-conviction hearing where h@ can
reexamine the facts and say, if this would have been seconddegree rape had th© lav? been in effect, you may consider
a lesser punishment accordingly.

That does not apply to

36
murder.
QUESTION:

That covers rap© convictions obtained

after Waddell and before the effectiva dat® of the now statute.
MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, as I understand it.
Before you proceed —•

MR. EAGLES:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.
— section 14-17 of the North Carolina

statute has this phrase in it "includes murder by any other
kind of willful, delifearat®, and premeditated killing."
that qualified in any way?

It seems terribly broad.

Is

I know

that's not the cas® you have her®, but as you point out, the
petitioner is attacking the system and the entire statute
facially.
MR. EAGLES:

The statute provides for first-degree

murder being undor two possibilities, your Honor, a list of
established offenses:

lying in wait, murder by poisons, or

those committed by premeditation and deliberation.
the one category.

That's

That is not limited, as I understand it.

If there is premeditation and deliberation and the judge will
instruct the jury as to what they may consider and how long
it need be, which is not very long under our lav,, then that's
first-degree murder.
Under the second category of first-degree murder is
the felony- murder rule.

In that situation, which is what w@

have here, robbery, which is on® of the newer

defenses under

37
3,4-17 , that a murder occur in the course of that robbery .
We also list four or five, as I recall, and the"other offenses,"
There is a limitation on the language "other offenses" as
our court has interpreted it.

It has interpreted "other

offenses" to talk in terms of those which are inherently
dangerous to human life or those for which there is a
substantial foreseeable risk of death or killing of an
individual and a death results.

That was, incidentally, on®

of the considerations -that the General Assembly took into
account as it was determining whether to par® down tbs
death penalty considerations, because arson was formerly a
death penalty offens® and they determined that simple arson
?

if that is not an anomaly, simp® arson without a human life
being lost ought not to result,' sine© it would result in the
death penalty if a human life was lost, if someone did di®
as a result of the murder felony.
QUESTION:

Is th®r© any other statute in the United

States with which you are familiar as broad as this on®?
MR. EAGLES:

I am not familiar with the other statute,

in other States, vour Honor.

I apologia®.

The basic argument which w@ intend to mak® her©
is that, first off, -there ar© two questions as other counsel
have indicated.
two questions.

Me agree with the notion that there ar©
The due process portions are not- raised here.

We are talking about a per s© system, the existence of our

38
discretion, if it is discretion, or judgment, as we prefer
to style it sine© discretion, carries with it the connotation
at least from petitioners8 brief of an arbitrariness and a
capriciousness which we believe and which we urge to you,
which wa believe is susceptible to proof, this does not exist
in our system.
The death penalty par s© as we urge it is not
unconstitutional.

It's not required as w® urge it.

Th©

plain language of fch© Const!tution,©van the evolving standards
of '

..

or maturing society standards, we believe can

only h© developed up to th© point where it runs into th©
plain language of th® Constitution which permits capital
punishment.

It's very explicit.

It's not casual reference,

it's not a single reference? a multiple reference by
implication and plain.
The judgment that's complained of in this case,
discretion if you will, is that judgment that necessarily
occurs in the constitutional mandate, process of trial of
0

any criminal, any accused person>

Th© prosecutor, the grand

juror, the petit juror, th© trial judge, and indeed our
appellate courts, Supreme Court of North. Carolina, which
hears ©very death case, are all acting pursuant to oaths of
office, statutory obligations, and in some cases constitutional,
obligations under our Constitution.

All thess things result,

w© believe, in a trial which is necessarily constitutionally

39
perfect in the sense of fairness and due process to the
individual being tried.

Having resulted in this, over 200

years of evolution of this country and its judicial system,
we are shocked, frankly, that petitioners now say that because
things are so fair and because your system is so judicious
and because your system is so careful about who finally
receives the death penalty, that then it’s arbitrary.

It

just does not follow, we urg©, it's logically fallacious,
it is not supported by any evidence that we are able to
assume.

It requires, we urge the Court, an assumption that

some or all of these officials b© acting in bad faith.
is no evidence of that, certainly not in this case.
not even an issue in this case.
in

There

That's

But that spectre hangs off

balance, as petitioners would have it, the way we

perceive their posture.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Eagles, let re® ask on© mors question

to ha sure I have it correctly in mind.

Did I correctly

understand that in North Carolina, unlike Louisiana, the
trial judge does not regularly submit a lesser included
offense instruction to the jury unless the evidence warrants
the instruction?
MR. EAGLESi

Only «her* there is some evidence,

and there are cases, may it please the Court, where reading
the whole record one is hard put to find the evidence on
which he bases that, and our court has addressed that

40
particular problem by saying that doubts should be resolved in
favor of ths accused being tried; not of course in favor of
the whole class of murders»
QUESTIONS

But your general rul© is different from

Louisiana practice.
MR. EAGLES:

Yes., sir, as I understood the Louisiana

rule being explained, it is very differant.
The last point that I want to make before X conclude
is the notion that the existence of capital punishment in our
judicial system being somehow abhorrent to society, there
is no evidence that w© have found aside from a scholarly
writing cited by petitioners, that tends to support that
doctrine.

The kind offices of the Solicitor General have

submitted documentary evidence and statistical evidence that
toads to go the other way.

We find that to be a draw, if you

will, that abhorrence is simply not established if it must be.
W@ urge this Court that the fact that the General
Assembly, the legislature, of the 35, 36 States, and of th©
Congress, in enacting th© death penalty in four years —~
this is not

and

an issue that has been ignored in th© past,

passed over, that th© Court is required to step in and
gat somebody's attention.

The attention of ths General Assembly,

th® attention of our elected representatives, has been focused
in every session of th® General Assembly of North Carolina
sine® 1961 and perhaps before that, we just didn't check that

41
far back, there has been a bill introduced to do sosi@tli.ing with
the death penalty, either modify it or eliminate it or change
it or do something with it, and -they have all failed.

The

bill that is before you today, the law that provides the
death penalty in this particular situation, passed the Senate
with only four dissenting votes of 50.

The vote in the House

was somewhat different, and there was a conference committe®.
Th© bill finally came out as a compromise.
The idea that death penalty is abhorrent to th©
standards of society’s decency is simply not supportable.
Indeed, to strip the States of their ultimate punishment to
stem the tide of robberies and murders would more likely
offend society.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Eagles.

Mr. Amsterdam, you have about two minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTH0N5T G. AMSTERDAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I have two minutes.

Let m® spend

half of it, I hop® no more, speaking to Justics Stevens5
question.

I don't think anybody hare knows the answer to th©

question whether leasers are submitted as a matter of routine
in North Carolina.

W© know -the law.

The law is that th®

trial judge is not required to submit lessors without
evidence, but if he does, the judgment will be affirmed.

42
QUESTIONS

Mr. Amsterdam, if in fact there is the

difference which counsel describes and which I know you dispute,
between the mandatory charge here of the North Carolina statute
and the greater area of discretion in the Louisiana practice,
and if in fact the North Carolina practice results in a larger
number of death penalties, would you nevertheless, under your
first argument conclude that the North Carolina statute is
less vulnerable than the Loui.sis.na statute?

That is what I

would understand to ha the thrust of your argument»
MR, AMSTERDAM%

Less vulnerable in a seal® of 1 to 100,

.yes, sir, but they are both vulnerable, and the difference
is marginal, in terms of where the line ought to go, if I may
put it that way»

There is a difference between them, but they

are both well below the line of constitutionality, and, the
difference between them is small in terms of the jump that
would have to be mad® to get up to constitutionality»
QUESTIONS

Suppos® over a period of time, six months

or a year, the Gallup Poll and the Harris Poll and all the
other polls that are conducted showed SO percent of the

Do you think that

enters into the constitutionality appraisal?
MR» AMSTERDAM?
QUESTION;

No, your Honor»

And the converse of that would b® true.

MR. AMSTERDAM;

I don't think that the plebiscites

43
cut one way or the other.
QUESTION?

Wei If, I got the impression from what you

said yesterday and this morning that in some way w® hav© to
evaluate the standards of the people of -this country today
in light of what people think.
MR. AMSTERDAM;

I think that6s true* but not as a

matter of plebiscite.
Your Honorc would it b© possible to ask the Court
for two more minutes, bscaus® the Government has had 35.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. AMSTERDAM;
very clear.

One more minute.

I simply want to make two points

First of all, to attack the death penalty on

8th Amendment grounds is not to express sympathy for crime.
It is not to express callousness with regard to victims.

The;

death penalty may be fch© greatest obstacle to adequate enforce­
ment of criraa in this country today because it stops public
conscience and makes you think we are doing something about
serious crim® instead of devising other methods of dealing with
it.
Secondly, w® are taxed in this case and have been
throughout our 8th Amendment presentation with the notion that
it is we who are seeking to have tills Court
gut feelings to be a superlegislature.

us© subjective

That is not true.

Our position is th© only coherent analytic position of the
8tfo Amendment.

The Government says that the death penalty

44
for jaywalking would be bad»

Why?

Because there is an

©motional feeling that is being invited that that's too much»
It can't be that it’s a comparative test, such as Solicitor
General Bark suggests.

If the 8th Amendment was written to

apply only to the Federal Government, not to the States , it
couldn't be asking a comparative question.

We submit simply

that our argument has a coherent-8th Amendment base adequately
and properly based on th® facts, accounts for the needs of
law enforcement and protection of victims, and under that
view the death penalty is a violation of th© 8th Amendment.
Thank you for th© extra —■
QUESTION:

Mr, Amsterdam, may I

another half a minute?

give you at least

I would like to ask this question.

I am sure you feel that each of these fivs statutes is
abhorrent and unconstitutional under the views that you have
expressed,

lot's assume for the moment that someone, somewhere

had to choose:among the five, which of the five, in your
judgment, you have studied them all, would be most .likely to
minimize the elements of discretion and arbitrariness that
are so offensive to you?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Hon© of them is close enough so that

I can give a meaningful answer to that question.

1 am not

trying to simply cop off th® question, it's just that they
don' t come close enough.

They ar® so close together’ in their

total impact and they ar© so far from where they ought to be

45
that to draw that marginal difference is essentially, I think,
meaningless, Mr. Justice —
QUESTION;

You think they ought to fo© zero.

I

understand that, but you have no choice among the five statutes!?
MR. AMSTERDAMt

No, I will say that on® of the

>■

problems with mandatory death penalty statutes, and I think
we

have got to face right up to this, is that in 80 or 90

percent of the cases that are processed through, all of the
actors involved, -the prosecutor, the jury, everybody recognises
a power, an extralegal power, and frequently exercises it.
Some court cases go right through the mill and nobody recognizes
they have got the power and these people end up dead because
nobody realized that all the discretion which is in the
system, which is exercised by other prosecutors and other
juries, was even available.

I think that is a very bad thing.

But is it bad, is it worse than what goes on under a system
in which overt discretion allows inconsistency judgments
?
with no impair&bi 1 ity? I think -they are both bad and as bad.
That53 the best 1 can do.
I thank the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES:

Thank you, Mr. Amsterdam.
