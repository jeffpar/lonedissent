proceedings
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74-1151 and 1419, Planned Parenthood
against Danforth, and Danforth against Planned Parenthood»
Mr» Susman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK SUSMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD, ETC., ET AL.
MR. SUSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Just a little over three years age this Court spoke
firmly and clearly, not as an advocate of abortion but as an
advocate of each individual woman's right under her then
existing particular circumatances, and in ccr-sultation with her
physician, to terminate her pregnancy.
Subject to certain and delineating compelling State
.interest, the right to abortion was then recognized as equal to
the right to beer children.
In the intervening three years, many things have
remained static and many other things have changed.
Unchanged, in particular, are certain fundamental
observations that were made by this Court in its decision in
Re3 vs. Macs.

These include:

One, the fact cf the sensitive and emotional nature
of the abortion controversy, the deep and seemingly absolute
convictiorB that the subject inspires; noted by the Court at

4
page 116»
Secondly was the support of the Court's position by
broadly based and concerned organizations, which included and
still include today things such as the American Medical
Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
American Public Health Association, and the American Bar
Association.

Also noted in the Court's opinion at pages 144

to 146.
And thirdly was the relative safety of abortion when
compared to the mortality risk normally associated with child­
birth.

Noted by tha Court at page 1490
And lastly was the observation that those trained in

the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theology
are unable to arrive at any concensus of the question of when
life begins.

Noted by the Court at page

159.

But I would suggest that even more dramatic are those
changes which had been directly wrought by the Court's decisions
of that day.
The first is that septic abortions in the United
/

States have decreased by fifty percent.
Secondly, maternal mortality

associated with

pregnancy has decreased by 80 percent in tha United States•
And, thirdly, illegitimate births have also
dramatica1ly decreased.
It is somehow cruelly ironic that that area of

medical practice afforded the greatest constitutional protection
by this Court is the same area of medical practice over which
the State of Missouri has seen fit to exercise the greatest
legislative control»
In 1971, just five years ago, approximately 30 percent
of the world's population had access to safe medical and legal
abortions»

Only five years later nov;, in 1976, two-thirds

of the world's population enjoys that right»
No democracy has ever reversed the trend of liberaliz­
ing abortion, once accomplished.

And yet the district court's

opinion below has severely throttled and restricted this
Court's opinions of Roe vs» Wade and Pea vs» Bolton.

And has

hampered the medical progress and the reproductive freedom for
women granted by this Court in 1973, and which was over a
hundred years in coning to pass»
In addition, there is a side effect of restrictive
abortions, and particularly those in the second trimester,
and that is that it threatens to cripple all of the advances
made in amniocentesis by which today approximately 60 serious
genetic chromosomal disorders can now be diagnosed.
We would also point out that the district court's
opinion below is the only federal court challenge to uphold
major legislation or policy in the area of cbortion, since
January 22nd of 1973»

In all other cases ir. which policy or

legislation was challenged, it was voided as not meeting the

6

requirements of Roe and Doe.
The jurisdiction of this Court is clear under the
holdings in Gcncales and HTM.
This Court, in Roa and Doe, and subsequent courts
which have had little difficulty in understanding the opinions
rendered by this Court, have set up certain standards and
tests by which abortion legislation and abortion policy is to
be judged,

find they include, among others, No. 1, the

delineation of the period of gestation into various periods,
frequently called trimesters, but not truly so5 that the first
trimester and then the second period running up to the point of
viability and the period afterwards.
They have consistently held that regulations not
observing these distinctions as set forward in the Court's
opinions are invalid.
Secondly is the test of equating abortion with other
procedures.

A test first enunciated by the Eighth Circuit in

a case entitled Doe vs. Poslker.

In that case, the Eighth

Circuit pointed out that any time the State seeks to single
out abortion from among the hundreds and thousands of other
medical and surgical procedures for special attention.

It has

imposed an extra layer of regulation and an extra burden,
and thus is invalid.
Thirdly, of the tests referred to by the Court
itself, those of compelling State interest, placing a stronger

7
burden upon the State who attempts to pass such regulation.
Along with the compelling State interest test, of
course, is the fact that any regulations enacted which conform
to those tests must be narrowly drawn, and we suggest, as we
will go through each of these sections that are challenged
here this morning, that they are not so narrowly drawn.
Again is a test which is required that abortion be
treated equally with childbirth, that it not be legislatively
disfavored by the legislation which is enacted, particularly
in light of the fact that abortion for periods well into the
second trimester are still safer than the mortality rates for
childbirth.
And lastly is the observation, th.es effect of any
restrictions upon access to abortion are mere onerous for the
poor and for the young.

It is basically, of course, very

difficult to go into any great detail in any of these sections,
due to che time that is allotted.

Therefore, we will attempt

to only take them in order as they appear in the statute.
The first section that was challenged is Section 2(2),
which involves the definition of viability.

The statute

provides that viability is defined as follows:

that stage of

fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be
continued indefinitely outside of the womb by a natural or
artificial life-supportive systems. This section needs to b©
read, of course, in conjunction with Section 5, providing that

8

no abortion, not necessary for life or health, may be performed
after the period of viability as statutorily defined.
This Court, in speaking of viability, spoke

about it

in several different ways and on three separate occasions.
First, on page 160 of the decision in Roe, they refer to
viability as usually being placed about seven months, 28 weeks,
but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.
Secondly, on page 163, the Court said:
time in which the fetus then presumably has the

That point of
capability of

meaningful life outside the mother's womb.
And in a third place, also on page 160, the Court
referred to:

when the fetus is potentially able to live out­

side the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.
We do not believe, as the State contends, that the
Court may only look to one of these meanings and thereby
incorporate it statutorily into the

statute.

We believe that

all three must be looked at and taken as a group.
First of all, this restriction in definition invades
the first trimester.

By the mere addition of the word

r*incefinitelyK , which did not appear in the Supreme Court's
decision, which dictionaries define, as "indsteminate"«

It

provides for a remote possibility, even for seconds of survival.
And yet the idea of brief respiratory gasps or fleeting heart­
beats are not considered by the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists as life.

9

Fleeting heartbeats and respiratory gasps are still
considered to qualify as a stillbirth under those definitions»
Three courts , three federal courts have held that in
fact this Court's language as to 28 weeks, but perhaps occurring
at 24, was not dicta; that, in fact, it was to be a lower limit
beyond which States could not allow viability to occur under
the then existing medical evidence before this Court in 1973»
The problem of defining viability involves whether
you're talking about a remote possibility of survival as
opposed to, perhaps, a probability»
This was a problem in the now celebrated trial of Dr»
Even in Boston»
We would suggest that, the standard be as follows:
that there be an irrefutable and conclusive presumption that
viability doss not occur before 24 weeks.

And we agree with

the three federal courts that have interpreted the Court's
decision as saying that this was not intended to be dicta or
was to be a holding»
And we further believe that in those cases of the
fetus being beyond 24 weeks in gestation, that the State has
the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that
particular fetus in question would have survived, and not the
possibility»

The fact that one in a thousand at that

particular stage of gestation might survive is no answer to
the doctor who is faced with making the decision at this time

10

as to whether the particular fetus is viable»
We also feel that it is necessary to have some form
of absolute lower limit, because in practiccj it has been shown
that the physician, of course,would intend to err on the side
of safety for himself in the legal processes and not necessarily
with only the woman's interest in mind.
The second section challenged is lhat, Section 3(2),
requiring patient’s consent.

This makes it a crime to perform

an abortion without requiring the woman to certify in writing
that her consent is informed, freely given aid not the result
of coercion»

It applies to all stages of pregnancy, and it

singles out abortion from all other medical and surgical
procedures, and makes the physician obtain *■>. specific form of
consent at the peril of being convicted of a crime.
QUESTION:

What is the traditional obligation of the

physician, with respect to a patient — independent of abortions
- ■- j ust p atients?
MR. SUSMAN:
QUESTION:

The obligation —
What is his obligatior with respect to the

measures he must take, even if he thinks the patient may be
probably dead but possibly may have life that can be preserved?
What is the traditional obligation of the physician?
MR. S US MAN:

I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, you’re

referring to normal patients or ~~
QUESTION:

Yes.

11
MR. SUSMAN:

— fetuses surviving birth.

I believe

the obligation —
QUESTION:

No, no, I'm not talking about fetuses

at all; I'm talking about people.
MR. SUSMAN:
QUESTION;

I believe the obligation ~
A man run down by an automobile, and a

physician happens to coma, and all of the vital signs appear
to be negative; but he sees soma that might indicate the
possibility of survival.
MR. SUSMAN:

What's his obligation?

Legally, I do not ~ if we're trying to

— I don't think we're getting into the Good Samaritan type
of —
QUESTION;

No, no, just as a doctor; a doctor isn't

just a Good Samaritan, he's a specialist.
MR. SUSMAN:

I think he has an obligation under the

normal manslaughter type statutes to use the ordinary means to
preserve life.

I do not believe that he has the obligation —

and most religious groups would agree that there is no
obligation to use extraordinary methods cf continuing heartbeat
or respiration.

He certainly has the obligation to use —

assuming he is that patient's

physician, he has the obligation,

under the normal manslaughter statutes, to use all ordinary means
to preserve life.
In normal consent, physicians always, whether minors
or adults, have an obligation to obtain an informed consent.

12

The reason, of course, is physicians normally, in any surgical
procedure, obtain written consents from the patients, is to
have some record and to protect themselves from future
potential civil liability»
But tliis is the only statute making it a crime not to
obtain a certain type

of consent»

The fact that the statute

requires the consent in this case be in writing, informed,
freely given and not the result of coercion, im no manner
accomplishes that fact.

It does net in any way guarantee that

that consent is informed, freely given or not the result of
coercion»

It merely requires that the woman so state»
QUESTION: Well, would you have any objection to a

simple requirement that the consent be informed, freely given
and so forth, if it were not required to be in writing?
MR. SUSMAN:

If the requirement were to single out

abortion from all the hundreds and thousands of other medical
and surgical procedures, I would»

I think this is —

QUESTION: But I thought you said this was the general
standard by which consent was judged for any sort of an opera­
tion.
MR. SUSMAN:

I believe it is.

But if abortion again

is to be singled out at the risk of criminal peril, I do not
think it can be sustained.
A general statute requiring informed consent of all
procedures would be acceptable.

13
QUESTION:

Well, what if the Legislature had

determined, or had some basis for deciding that in a particular
type of operation there was more reason to question the
consents that were given, than in another type; wouldn't it be
permitted to address that problem?
MR. SUSMAN:

I believe it would, but I do not

believe that this particular statute addresses that problem,
because it does not, in any way, define what constitutes
"informed".

It merely states that it must be informed, but it

does not state as to whether it should be informed as the
procedures, the risks, the complications, the results.

It

gives no indication, again at the risk of criminal peril to
the physician, what constitutes an informed

consent.

And an informed consent, basically in civil liability
cases, requires expert testimony, at least in Missouri, of
other* doctors as to whetiter or not the consarit given was
informed.
QUESTION: And why is tills invalid?
MR. SUSMAN:

This particular — this patient

consent clause, we believe, is invalid? No. 1, because it applies
to all trimesters, contrary to the Court's decisions in Roe?
secondly
QUESTION:

But the Court didn't deal with this in Roe,

did it?
MR. SUSMAN:

Did not deal specifically with the

14
consents, but we believe that the Court stated that there was
to be no regulation during the first trimester»

This,

we

believe, falls into the area of regulation.
QUESTION:

Would you include in that no regulation

language you're referring to that the State could not. require
a medical report to be filed with the health department?
MR. SUSMAN:

Yes, we would, and that is because -~

QUESTION:

Can't file — the St cite can't demand a

report?
MR. SUSMANj

If abortion is being singled out for

reporting and recordkeeping considerations, we do net believe
they can be.

These are —

QUESTION;

And what provision of the Constitution do

you rely on there?
MR. SUSMAN:

Well, I think all there rights have to

go back to the Fourteenth Amendment, the right of privacy
upon v/hich the Court based its decision in I,os.
This is — these recordkeeping requirements, the
patient consent requirements, have been judged by previous
courts and also voided based on the decisions in Roe and Doe,
of infringing into the first trimester.
In a Kentucky case, a three-judge federal court
panel, a case entitled Wolfe vs. Senroaring, specifically held
in regard to patient consent that it was overbroad, because it
also involved the first trimester.

15
In addition, the Hodgson panel in Minnesota voided
the same type of patient consent for the reasons that it
affected the first trimester and also it singled out abortion
and it was unnecessary for either maternal or fetal health,,
I hope I've answered the question.
The second section challenged is Section 3(3), which
is that requiring the consent of the woman's spouse for the
procedure.
This question is really whether or not the husband
has the right to control the medical treatment of his wife.
The question of course was not decided in Roe; in fact, there
is a footnote saying there was no need tc decide the question
at that time.
Approximately, nationwide, 30 percent of the women
obtaining abortions are married.

We believe that this require­

ment unduly interferes with physician-patient, relationship,
and injects unnecessarily the husband into the medical
cons n 1

on*
There is no ether statute in the State of Missouri

which requires spousal consent for a medical act.
Also, there is no room for compromise in such a
section.

It is an all-or-none type of situation.

The husband

— either he's given the veto right or he has no rights.
Unfortunately, there is vary little room for compromise in this
type of a situation.

yet — '

16
QUESTION:

Do you think the State of Missouri could

lawfully require the consent of the spouse to any major surgical
procedure on the other spouse?
MR. SUSMAN:

No, I do not.

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not worried about whether they

They have not chosen to

do so —

did.

Can they do so constitutionally?
And you say they can't.
MR. SUSMAN:

I think it is less -- I think it would

be harder to void such statutes than it would in this area.
There has bean constitutional guarantees tc- reproductive
medicine in many ways, whether it be contraception, steriliza­
tion, abortion; and that type of constitutional protection
guarantees have not yet been extended to otiter types of medical
procedures.
While I personally believe that requiring spousal
consent for any type of surgery is invalid, I do not belisva
the decisions of this Court have thus — have gone that far.
Rut I would personally object to ihem.
This provision also requires and tipplies to all stages
of pregnancy.

It allows the decision of the spouse to over­

ride the decision of a woman and her doctor.
All the doctors at trial testified it was not normal
medical practice to obtain tha consent of the spouse in order
— for medical procedures upon the wife, including items such

17
as sterilization.
There is also, we would suggest, no compelling State
interest for maternal health requiring the spouse's consent.
The State suggests that the reason to require it is
the husband's interest, not in the fetus, not in the child, but
the husband's and the State's compelling State interest in the
marital relationship.

A new compelling State interest, and

one not mentioned in Roe and Doe.
First of all, of course, the reason that the husband's
interest is in the marital relationship and not in the fetus
is that the statute does not require that the husband be the
father of the fetus.

lie need not have fathered this particular

pregnancy, but yet his consent is still required.
In addition, ha may not even be Iccatable.
have

deserted his spouse ten years previously.

He may

And if she does

not know where he is, she; still must require his consent, and
no exceptions are made.
V7a would also suggest that you may well have the case
where a father has not fathered the pregnancy or the fetus,
and yet he withholds his consent from the woman and then would
have no legal liability for the upbringing cr raising of -the
child, because it would not be his child.
There is a unanimous line of cases dealing with
spousal consent, both in State courts — anc. one State court
case, mainly being Jones__vs_._ Smith in Florida.

Putative fathers

18
have also been held, in the decision by Justice Stevens in
Doe vs. Beilin Memorial Hospital, not to be indispensable parties
to a case in which a woman sought an, abortion at a private
hospital.

Other federal courts, panels, in Doe vs, Rampton,

Coe vs. Gerstein, and three or four others, the most recent

tig

not cited in the Appellants' brief is a case entitled Weeks vs0
?
Carnick, decided in tha district court in Louisiana in January

dck
■nac

of this year.
All have held that spousal consent is a void require­
ment.

There has been no case upholding a spousal consent

clause.
Missouri has not seen fit to require spousal consent
for either artificial insemination, sterilization, hysterectomy,
or any other procedure, for that matter.
The next section would be Section 3(4), which is the
parental consent.
relationship.

This also interferes with the doctor-patient

Again, no other criminal statute singles out

parental consent as necessary for the treatment of minors.
Minors in Missouri may specifically be treated for
VD, drugs, and pregnancy, excluding abortion, by statute without
knowledge or without consent of the parents.

In other words,

they may perhaps be sterilized, receive contraceptions, bear
children, and do all the other pregnancy related acts without
the consent of the parents, with the sole exception of abortion.
In fact, minors, for example, who already have children

19

who are now widowed and divorced, with children under eighteen,
would still require consent of the parents for any future
pregnancy in order to terminate it.
QUESTION:

Hasn’t the State of Missouri recognized

the doctrine of the emancipation of a person by marriage?
MR. SUSMAN:

Once the minor would be married, the

jcinors under eighteen.

If she became married, then she would

switch over to the spousal consent clauses
QUESTION:

So she —

Than if she became — your point is, then,

if she bacons widowed and were still under eighteen, the
parental consent clause would —

That is right.

Spring back.

You mean the death of the husband

MR. SUSMAN:

Yes.

Particularly in light of tie

specific statute —
QUESTION:

Has the Supreme Court cf Missouri ever

held that?
MR. SUSMAN: Well, the Supreme Court of Missouri, of
course, has never ruled on this statute.
QUESTION:

They had —

Well, it might come up in other areas.

Emancipation would coma up in many situations, would it not?

20

MR» SUSMAN:

We have no real — to my knowledge —

no real emancipation canes.

This has been a problem in child

support cases arising out of dissolutions of marriages, and
there are no hard-and-fast cases dealing with what makes a minor
emancipated in the State of Missouri.
We also suggest ther& is no compelling State interest.
In regard to both the spousal and the. parental consent clauses,
the State suggests that somehow marital hamony will be
preserved by requiring the consent of the spouse or the consent
of the parents for a minor.
It is difficult to balieve how marital harmony is
better preserved by requiring a child or a vrife to have a child
she does not went than to preserve it by allowing her to
terminate that pregnancy when the parents or the husband does
net desire her to do so.
Neither one, we suggest, contributes to marital
harmony; that neither one contributes to more or less marital
harmony.
In regard to parental consent, we would also note
that the morbidity and mortality rates for minors having —
being pregnant are much greater than they are for adults.
And all of the factors that

this Court recognized at page 150

of its decision are adversely, and multiplied for minors, than
they were for the adults then under consideration.

All of the

emotional distress and psychological burdens that an unwanted

21
pregnancy places.
Again, in the case of parental consent, while they
can require, by withholding their consent, a child to have, to
give birth, the parents would have no legal obligation or
responsibility to raise that child or that grandchild, it would
solely be the responsibility for her life of the minor, the
unwed minor.
In analogous situations, minors have been held in
two recant federal court cases not to require parental consent
to receive contraception,

And we suggest that these cases are

very much on point.
QUESTION:

Mr. Susman, do you disagree with Judge

Webster's view on the parental consent? namely, that it depends
on the ability of the mother to give consent, rather than a
specific age?

Or do you say no consent at all?

MR. SUSMAN:

I do.

I think every informed consent —-

doctors face the same question when treating an adult.

The

more fact that the adult is over 21 does not really mean,
automatically, that she is capable of giving an informed
consent.
I think informed consent, regardless of age, has to
be based in each individual case upon the age, maturity,
education, intelligence and judgment cf the individual then
confronting the physician.

And each case must be looked at

independently, whether over or under the age* of majority.

22

I would —
QUESTION:

Well, your view, just to be sure I under­

stand, is that the parental consent should never be required for
any age or any state of mentality or anything else in life?
MR. SUSMAN:

That is not correct.

If the physician,

in talking with the child and the patient, the minor patient,
determines that she is incapable, based upon the various factors
I have delineated, is incapable of giving parental consent,
then I think, of course, the right to give or withhold must
pass to soma ether responsible individual? whether or not it
should be the parents, whether or not it should ba a guardian
appointed by the court is another question.

But if the minor

is incapable, certainly someone else, rather than to have the
decision made through default.
I will reserve whatever remaining time I have for
rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Susman.

Mr. Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. DANFORTI I, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF JOHN C. DANFORTE, ET AL.
MR. DANFORTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The one overriding issue in this case is whether
State Legislatures still retain the power to regulate in major

23

areas traditionally within their power.
In resolving this issue, the Court is faced with
several very important sub-questions.
First, does the State Legislature still have the power
to define the terms and obligations of marriage?
Second, does the Legislature still have the power to
protect minors from their own immaturity, where stressful and
tenuous decisions must be made?
Third, does the Legislature still have the power to
enact reasonable regulations of a trade or profession for the
sake of public health, safety and welfare?
It is the position of the State c:! Missouri that the
answer to each of these questions is yes.
First, with respect to spousal consent, the Legis­
lature of our State, has, in effect, said, through the statute,
tiiat inherent in marriage is that certain decisions are made
jointly by husband and wife or they're not made at all.

That

this is the very definition of what marriage is all about.
The Legislature has done this elsewhere, not only in
the State of Missouri, but in other States as well.

For

example, if a woman has given birth to a child and then
decides that she wants to place the child for adoption, if the
woman is not married, she alone, can make that decision.

If the

woman is married, her husband must join in that decision to
placa the child for adoption.

24
The right to consent is not in the putative father
in the State of Missouri»

The right to consent to an adoption

is in the husband, because this is a fundamental decision
relating to what the family is all about»
With respect to artificial insemination, those
States which have legislated on this subject — and Missouri
is not one of them — have provided specifically that in the case
of a married woman the legitimatization of the child depends
upon the consent of the husband, if the woman is married»
In the case of sterilization, two or three States
that have legislated in this area have provided expressly that
if the woman is married, her husband must join in approval
of sterilization.

Missouri is not one of those States.

Obviously, Legislatures have provided all over the
country that where real property is conveyed during a marriage
the husband or wife must join in consent tc that conveyance.
The fact of the matter is that it has historically been the
job and the province of State Legislatures to provide by
legislation that certain fundamental decisions for the marital
entity have to be made by both parties, especially where change
is required.
And this definition of marriage, this pov/ea' of
Legislatures rather than the courts, to define what marriage
is all about, has been recognized by this Co\xrt for at least
the last one hundred years.

25

Expressly, in the case of Reynolds vs. United States,
which, incidentally, involved a fundamental constitutional
right — namely, religion — where the Court held that a
statute prohibiting polygamy was not unconstitutionalD
Likewise, in the case of

Maynard vs, Ilill, decided

by this Court in 1888, the Court expressly said in that case
that it is the job of the Legislature and not trie courts to
define the meaning of marriage and the terms and the obligations
of marriage, and what marriage is„
And we believe that this power, which has always bean
in the Legislature, should be in the Legislature now as well.
QUESTION;

Hr. Attorney General, is there any other

statute in Missouri that requires the consent of a spouse to
a medical procedure?
MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

This is the only one?

MR. DANFORTH:

That’s right.

This is also the only medical procedure, or the
most striking medical procedure, Mr. Justice Marshall, that
would alter the nature of the family, and would change a
direction which the family has taken.
QUESTION:

That's your conclusion.

MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

That’s your conclusion.

MR. DANFORTH:

That is my conclusion, sir.

26

QUESTION:

What about hysterectomy?

MR. DAN FORTI I:

No, sir, not — no consent is required

by the Legislature.
QUESTION: Well, how do you reconcile that with what
you've just said?
MR. DANFORTH:

Well, I don't believe, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, that it's necessary for the General Assembly to
cover every possible type of medical situation in a series of
statutes to render one particular statute constitutional.
Furthermore, you have a case where the woman is
pregnant and is married, where something has happened in the
marriage itself, and that condition is either going to yield
to an addition to the family, which is proximate and immediate,
or it's going to bs aborted.

And it's our position that it is

for the Stats Legislature to say that that kind of decision
can bs and must be jointly made, and that there

is no

constitutional provision which provides that the woman and the
woman alone, without the consent ox the husband, can males that
kind of decision.
QUESTION:

In your answer to Hr. Justice Blackmun,

were you implying that the State of Missouri has the right
and still has the reserve right to legislate in these other
areas to require, for example, spousal consent for sterilization
or any ether procedure?
MR. DANFORTH:

I think it does. Your Honor.

I believe

27
that the Legislature could so provide.

It hasn't in this case.

I think that the issue becomes elevated to a much different
plane when the birth of a coming child is involved.
And I would also say that, whereas Mr. Susman said
that if the husband isn't the father of the child, he has no
legal obligations; I think that's just wrong.
a misstatement, of law.

I think that's

If the husband approves of the wife

having the baby, he assumes

responsibility for that baby.

In fact, there is no stronger presumption in the law than that
a husband is in fact the father of any child born of that
marriage.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, I'm not sure I

understood your answer to Justice Blackmun's question about
hysterectomy.

.

'

Is it your answer that that procedure would not
have a profound effect on the long-run family situation?
MR. DANFCRTH:
would.

I think that — yes, I think it

I think that —
QUESTION:

Well, then, how can you — previously I

thought you said that the distinguishing feature of this
statute was that it involved the only procedure which would have
that kind of effect on the family.

It seems to me it is a

little inconsistent.
MR. DANFORTH:

Well, I think that this type of

statute involving an abortion

is a change in a family situation

28

which has already been commenced.

That is, the future baby is

on the way in this case, and I think that the Legislature could
reasonably say that unlike a hysterectomy, which nay or may not
be called for any number of medical reasons, an abortion which
is essentially an elective procedure by the woman, which
terminates the pregnancy, is one that the husband has a particu­
lar interest in.
I would point out also that the Legislature obviously
does regulate the institution of marriage in a number of
different ways.

It provides the statutes under which people

become married.

It provides the grounds for divorce, and the

procedures for the divorce.

The criminal laws of the State do

prohibit the way in, which people can use their ov?n bodies
during a marriage.

Adultery and bigamy are both criminal

offenses in the State of Missouri,
QUESTION:

When last did you have a conviction of

adultery in Missouri?
MR. DANFORTH;

I don't know, Your Honor.

I don't

KHOls t

With respect to the requirement cf parental consent,
the Legislature has in effect said in this statute that where
decisions are to be made, miners — those; people under the age
of eighteen — simply don't have the maturity to make this kind
of stressful end tenuous decision.
The statute provides only for the consent of a parent

29

if a child has not yet reached her eighteenth birthday»
QUESTION:

In Missouri, under contract law, is a

parent, as in most States, liable for necessary obligations
incurred by a minor child?
MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

I think that's correct, Your Honor»

Then if the child, without the knowledge

or consent of the parent, contracted for this surgical
procedure, the parents would be liable to pay —
MR. DANFORTH:

I don't know, because I don't know

if tiiis would be construed as being necessary»
QUESTION:

Well, I say liable if — I hadn't

finished -- liable if there could be a. showing that this was
-- fell within tie category of necessaries?
MR, DANFORTH:

Yes.

However, I think that tie whole

point in what the Court stressed in Roe vs»_ Wade is that
abortion, unlike most medical procedures, is generally
elective»

That is, it's one where the woman makes a decision,

and the evidence at trial is that that decision is a stressful
and a tenuous decision»

It's a difficult decision»

In Roe vs o Wado, and I think this is a very important
point, the Court indicated that the decision to have an
abortion was a decision that the woman should make in
consultation with her responsible physician.

But the faces in

this case are that, there is no consultation with a physician
whatever; that the physican makes no decision whatever»

That,

30
in fact, what happens is that the physician is one of a number
of doctors on a roster, who shows up for, say, one morning a
week and performs in a period — and this is the case, the
evidence in the trial, Reproductive Health Services, which is
the abortion clinic in the City of St. Louis

the physician

shows up end in a period of three and a half hours performs
eight abortions on total strangers.

And there is absolutely

no counseling or medical input from the physician.

There is

a degree of counseling from people who appear to have no
special expertise in counseling, no knowledge of what they're
doing, and I would say a strong presumption in their case that
they have soma axe to grind in seeing that abortions are
conducted.
The State, in the case of minors, does, in a number
of different ways, regulate and limit what minors can do.
Minors are not treated by the State of Missouri in the same
manner as adults.
may not buy liquor.

Minors in our State may not vote.
Minors may not buy cigcirettes.

Minors
Minors

may not sue or be sued without a guardian ad litem or a next
friend.

Minors may void contracts.

Minors after they reach

majority may set aside real estate conveyances.
The consent of a parent is required when a minor
marries.

The consent of a parent is required in Missouri when

a minor buys firearms; when a minor sells property to a pawn
broker; and even when a minor goes into a pool hall in our State,

31
the consent of a parent is required»
QUESTION:

Under Missouri law, if an abortion were

performed, let us say, on a 12-year-old or a 13-year-old girl
in this clinic, in the process you describe, and if

afterwards

she said that her — that she was incapable of giving consent
because of her immaturity and youth, that is, her chronological
age and immaturity, which she under Missouri law have a mal­
practice suit against the doctor on an assault type of theory?
MR, DANFORT!!:
QUESTION:

I think it would bo a battery»

Battery, I meant to say, yes? a battery

type of theory, yes.
MR, DANFORTH:

Yes, sir, and thtsn the question is,

Well, what — then why have a criminal statute?

And of course

the reason is that a girl between the ages of ten and
seventeen — and there is evidence that children ten years
old have sought abortions in our State -*• between the ages of
ten and, at the oldest, the eighteenth birthday, going off
secretly to have an abortion and having it and not telling the
parent, the parent would be none the wiser, and there would be
no battery, there would be no lawsuit brought,
QUESTION: Do you know whether in Missouri, or any
ether States, any such actions for malpractice on a

battery

theory have been brought by minors who — is there any
history of that anywhere, do you know?
MR» DANFORTII:

I don't know? I'm sorry.

I don't know

32

the answer to that.
QUESTION: Does the doctor, in those circumstances —•
let's say a 12-year-old girl — under Missouri practice as
distinguished from statutory requirements, get a signed consent
from the girl?
MR. DANFORTH:

Yes.

The —

QUESTION: Without any other — the intervention of
aiiy other person?
MR. DANFORTH:

The standard practice — and this was

the evidence at the trial — the standard practice was prior
to the passage of the law, and of course new the effectiveness
has bean stayed by this Court, so I think it's probably still
the case, is that the standard practice was to obtain the
written consent of the individual and also the written consent
of the parent if the individual was a minor.
Now, an argument has been made here that, well, why
not judge each case on its own?

Why presume that every child

under the age of eighteen is incapable of an informed consent?
But the Legislature, as a matter of fact, provides
age levels for voting, for drinking, for everything else.

It

doesn't say that — there is no constitutional right for a
bright mature person, who is sixteen or seventeen years old,
to vote in the Stats of Missouri, even though voting is a
fundamental right.
It would be absolutely unworkable to try to judge

33
the maturity of each person? and if the maturity of each
individual minor is to be judged, we would submit that the
parent is the only person who is qualified to make that
judgment»

I think anyone who has ever had a teen-aged child

will know that the child one minute can act very mature, and
the next minutes can act very immature.

And an amateur

counselor, on the basis of one hour of amateur counseling, I
don't think can make that kind of judgment as to whether or
not the child is mature enough to have an abortion.
QUESTION: What is the age of minority — majority
in Missouri?
MR. DANFORTH:
Blackmun.

Wall, it's changing, Justice

It was twenty'*one, and it's been in the process of

change in our Legislature to eighteen now.

The Legislature

purported to change the age of majority in on® fell swoop by
simply deleting the word "twsnty-one" and rewriting '’eighteen'
That was held unconstitutional by our Stents courts.

So now

it’s taking the statutes seriatim and chancing then from
tventy-ons to eighteen.
QUESTION:

Is -idie general pattern the sane for males

as for females?
MR. DANFOETH:

Yes.

I think it would *— I think there

is an exception for age to agree to be married.

That is, the

aye where parental consent is required for marriage.
statutory rape, I believe, is different.

And the

34

QUESTION!

Well, what is ~ is there a statutory

rape that can be committed on a man in Missouri?
MR. DANFORTII:

I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to

that question.
QUESTION!

What is the statutory age again of

consent, in the statutory rape area?
MR. DANFORTII:

I think it's fifteen for a — but I

don't have that at my fingertips.
I would also point out —QUESTION: And what's the age for a minor getting
married?
MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

Eighteen.

Eighteen,

Well, now, if a 15-year-old boy or girl

wants to get married, what —
MR, DANFORTH:

It would require: the consent of a

parent.
QUESTION:

I suppose --- what in Missouri law would

be the status of the marriage if, in fact, a clergyman or a
justice of the peace performed it, laying aside their possible
criminal violation?

Would it be a valid marriage?

MR. DANFORTH:

I don't think so.

I would guess it

would be void.
Now, that section of the statute on which most of
\

the evidence was presented at trial had to do with the prohibitici
of one of the various mid-trimester means of abortion, called

35

saline amniocentesis.

And what happened in this case was that

the Missouri General Assembly, on the basis of hearings that
were held and medical evidence that was presented, both orally
and written medical journals that were presented, determined
that the saline method of abortion was the most dangerous of
the two fundamental alternative methods of raid-trimester
abortion.
Saline is not a first trimester method of abortion;
it's purely a post first trimester abortion.
There are other post-trimester methods.
and hysterotomy are two.
than saline.

Hysterectomy

They are concedediy more dangerous

However, where hysterectomy and hysterotomy are

called for, there is no alternative to them„ And therefore,
if the General Assembly had outlawed hysterectomies and
hysterotomies, it would have outlawed abortions during the
second trimester.

And it did not do so.

With respect to saline there is an alternate method
of abortion in mid-trimesters, called prostaglandin.
Prostaglandin is a different kind of method.

It is readily

available, and it is safer. And -there was substantial evidence
presented to the General Assembly for this point. There was
substantial evidence presented at trial for -this point,
including the testimony of the Chief of Obstetrics at the
Yale-New Haven Hospital, who said that in his opinion if a
doctor used saline instead of prostaglandin that the doctor

36

would be liable for malpractice.
Roe vs. Wade, of course, allows —
QUESTION:

Was there any opposing testimony?

MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, sir?

Any opposing testimony?

MR. DANFORTH:

There was testimony from a Dr.

Kerenyi in New York, who is probably the leading practitioner
and expert in the field of saline, and he felt that saline was
a very safe method, and the safest method.
Before the — that was at trial

before the General

Assembly, there was certainly notice, I think representatives
of the pro-abortion groups were present at idie hearing.

I'm

not sure whether or not evidence was presented at the
legislative herring on the relative safety of prostaglandin
an d

3

a1rne.
QUESTION:

Is there some evidence in this record

about -fclia unavailability of the other procedure?
MR. DANFORTHs
QUESTION:

In our record?

Yes„

MR. DANFORTH:

Yes, sir, tiiere is.

Dr. Anderson, about the frvailability of it.

The testimony of
Dr. Anderson

testified that prostaglandin had been approved after a trial
period, approved by the FDA for use as of January 1974.

That

the Upjohn Company, which is the manufacturer of prostaglandin,
restricted its sale to certain medical centers and teaching

37

hospitals for the first six months of 1974, so that, as he
put it, information as to its use could trickle out to the
medical community.
As of July 1974, when the trial of — or when Dr0
Anderson's deposition was taken, he said that this was
available in small hospitals also throughout the country.
So, as of July '74, it was available in small hospitals.
The decision of the district court was predicated on the finding
of alternative methods for mid-trimester abortion.
There; are certain very rare cases , statisti cally very
rare cases, where prostaglandin is contraindicated.

In those

very rare cases, subs tanti ally less than one: percent of all
mid-trines ter abortions, the testimony of Dr*. Anderson was
that the person, the patient could be treated and then given
prostaglandin after the treatment.
Also, in addition to prostaglandin, there are other
alternative methods called mechanical stimuli, which can be
used to accomplish a mid-trimester abortion*
Roe vs. Wads, of course, allowed the State to
promulgate reasonable regulations for maternal health after the
first trimester.

The State cf Missouri, our* State Legislature

did in fact take the court up on that, on id tat statement, and
this is exactly what tine prohibition of saline is all about.
Tire government —- cn.e point is made by tire Appellants
in this case that there is a constitutional right to practice

38

medicine, I take it, free from governmental regulation.
We simply reject that theory.

And the Court

rejected that theory in the case of United States vs. Moore,
which you decided last December, involving the use of —
whatever the substitute for heroin is called — to treat
heroin addiction.
QUESTION;

Methadone.

MR. DANFOKTH:

Methadone, yes; thank you.

And in that case the Court said that the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare, together with the Justice
Department, the Attorney General could set forth the
permissible standards for treating heroin addiction.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, can I be sure —

I want to bo sure I have some tiling straight.

Did I correctly

understand you to say that the hearings before the Legislature
did not include any testimony about the relative safety of the
saline procedure?
MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

Yes, it did, sir.

Oh, it did?

MR. DANFORTH;

I most definitely did.

Both oral

testimony and written material, meed cal journal articles ana
the like, were presented comparing saline with prostaglandin.
And those medical journals were presented to the district court
in this case; introduced at the district court level in this
case

39

And, furthermore, there were public hearings? both
sides had an opportunity to present evidence as to —
QUESTION:

Well, what you said, I guess, was that

you weren't sure there was any testimony in those hearings
that the alternative procedure was safer,.
MR. DANFORTH:
QUESTION:

That's —

No, that's right.

That's correct.

I see.

MR. DANFORTH:

But tiiere certainly was every

opportunity to and this v;as a two-year process in passing this
law? it went through two legislative sessions.

And the question

of saline was debated both in hearings and on the Floor of
both, Houses of the State Legislature.

So it was not a kind of

a secret move to push across prostaglandin.
I don’t believe,, and it’s the position of our State,
that Roa vs. Wade and Doe vs. Bo].ten so exalted the constitu­
tional right to an abortion that all of those traditional
areas of State legislative action have somehow been suddenly
wiped out es a result of Roa and Doe.
find I find it difficult to imagines how the rights to
an abortion can bo used to wipe out the State traditional
authority to regulate in toe case of marriage, in the case of
protecting minors, and in toe case of the; operation of a trade
or a profession, without having a series of Pandora's boxes
opened with respect to State powers.
I would think, for example, that if the State cannot

40
define the terms of marriage in this circumstance, it would
equally fall that the State statute requiring spousal consent
for adoption, placing a child for adoption would fall, and
that any State restraint on using your body as you like, in
adultery or bigamy, that those prohibitions would fall as well.
If a minor cannot be protected from her own
improvidence and immaturity where this kind of stressful and
tenuous decision is called for, I don't see how any State
statute treating minors differently from adults could pass
constitutional muster.

• c

And if 'the State cannot regulate the practice of
?
medicina, I think that wo're right back in the box of Blackmsr
vs. New York, end the cases which followed it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Attorney

General.
Mr. Susman , in your view do the statutory provisions
in Missouri fall ~ thew relating to the necessity of parental
concent for marriage s of persons under age eighteen, and others
like it?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK SUSMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD, ETC., ET AL.
MR. SUSMAN:

While realising that marriage, voting

are also fundamental rights upon which the State has imposed
certain age limits, I cannot put 'those pers on ally in the same

41
class as an abortion.

Because those rights to marriage and

those rights to vote are only postponed for a limited and
small number of years, they are rights that are postponed,
and the damanage for — excuse me?

QUESTION:

Your answer is that the statutory rape

age limits will survive and —
MR. SUSMAN:

That's correcto

If you look at the

alternatives or the disastrous consequences of postponing
for three years the right to vote or the right to marriage
as opposed to the right to terminate a pregnancy because your
religious beliefs may differ from those of your parents, who
are given a veto right for any reason or for no reason whatsoeven to say no? I cannot put them into the same class.
QUESTION: And you put the statutory rape age limit
in the same category?
MR. SUSMAN:
QUESTION:

That that's a valid —■
Yes, I do.
IThat do you have

do you have any

comment on the problem of a malpractice suit against a doctor
based on the claim that the State by statute has said that a
minor, of the age of twelve or thirteen, cannot legally consent
in a rape case; therefore, it should follow •— that would be
the argument -«• she cannot consent to an abortion and therefore
render the doctor, the aborting doctor liable to malpractice?
MR. SUSMAN:

I think the malpractice civil liability

problems in regard to giving abortions to minors is no more nor

42

no less than those of deciding on whether or not any patient,
regardless of age, is giving an informed consent based on the
procedure at hand.
QUESTION:

In effect you're saying that a 12-year-old

girl i3 capable of giving an informed consent —
MR. SUS MAN:

QUESTION:
MR. BUSMAN:

I think certainly the number —
— to an abortion?
— the number of 12-year-old girls is

much less than the number of 13-year-old girls? but I would
not be willing to make a blanket statement that there are no
12-ysar-old girls who arc capable of giving consent to an
abortion.
QUESTION: And you say the Legislature can't draw any
line on the basis that there are a lot more 13-year-olds who
are capable than there are 12-year-olds who are capable?
MR. S USMAN:

I do not believe, that they can,

particularly in light of this particular statute, the parents
can say no for any reason or for no reason whatsoever.

Even a

difference in religious beliefs — there art: no guidelines
under which their consent can be withheld.

It's completely

arbitrary'.
QUESTION:

Well, can you tell that, without the State

courts ever having construed the statute?
MR. SUSMAN:

I think you can, because I think the

statute is so literal that it can't be read any other way.

43

You must have a parent -- parental consent, or else it is a
crime for the doctor to perform the procedure.
In the few — I have no time left.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. S US MAN:

Thank you.

Well, you may —
I’d like to say just a few

words, if I could, about saline, which has arisen, and which
I was not able to reach due to the time factor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may have another two

minutes at this time.
MR. SUSMAN;

Thank you.

First of ell, the testimony was unequivocal that
saline is the procedure of choice for post first trimester in
over 75 percent of all cases in this country.

There was no

evidence whatsoever in the record that prostaglandins were
available, much less in use anywhere in the STate of Missouri.
And, as a mat tor of fact, as a fact they arc not presently being
used by anyone in the State of Missouri as a procedure.
In addition, all of -the evidence, also without
exception, shoved that saline is still safer than -— I'm sorry.
That saline mortality rates are less than those of natural
childbirth.
Dr. Anderson, the Appellees' — the only medical
witness of Appellees who had any experience in the abortion
field, testified that if confronted with a case in which
prostaglandins were contraindicated, saline would be his

44
procedure of choice.
I would only conclude by saying that the sole
exception, again, of this case, all other statutes in each
and every one of these sections has been reviewed by other
courts, adopted by other States, and on each and every occasion
was struck down.
We would implore this Court to stand by the language
and intent of its 1973 decisions, and not to allow the
unwarranted

encumbrances upon the rights of women and their

physicians, to drive women back to the septic and illegal
avenues of relief, which were so prevalent prior to 1973,
and which than existed as the only avenues of relief for the
pcor and the young and the unsophisticatod.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF -JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:11 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
