MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1046,, Weinberger against. Diaz.
Mrs. Shapiro,, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on direct appeal by the
government from the decision of a three-judge district court
in the Southern District of Florida.
Like the preceding case, it involves a challenge
to the Federal. Government's power to classify on the basis
of alienage but this ease challenges an alienage classifi­
cation which limits eligibility to to a federal health
insurance program for the elderly, Medicare part B., or
supplementary Medicare medical insurance.
Part B is part of the Social Security system.
The major part of that system is, of course,
Old Age and Survivor's Insurance.

Eligibility for those

benefits depends on age and past work in covered employment.
It is equally available to aliens and citizens.
This basic retirement insurance is supplemented
by Medicare, parts A and B.
t art A provides hospitalization insurance and B

4
provides insurance covering certain other medical costs such
as doctors’ fees and medicines.
Since parts

A

and B were intended to supplement

the basic retirement systems, both are made available to
anyone, alien or citizen, who is entitled to Social Security
benefits or, indeed, to Railroad Retirement benefits.
Appellees’ complaint is that they are denied
equal protection because sub-part B is also available to
citizens without regard to their work in covered employment
but to non-covered aliens, only if they have been admitted
for permanent residence and lived here for five years.
Our principal answer to that complaint is that
equal protection analysis is simply not relevant in
considering the constitutionality of federal statutes which
distinguish betvreen citizens and aliens in their status as
a

aliens and if equal protection analysis is relevant at all,
the scope of judicial review in this case is extraordinarily
limited — certainly no more than the traditional rational
basis test is appropriate.
Our arguments along these lines were thoroughly
discussed this morning and I don’t plan to go over that
ground again.
Instead, I would like to focus on the Medicare
statutes and show that if a rational basis test is to be
..li"~ Sut'fcu“e

clearly constitutional.

5

But first, I want to speak briefly of the
jurisdictional issues in light of this Court's recent
decision on Weinberger v. Salfi.
Appellees are three aliens who brought this suit
as a class action to challenge the Secretary's refusal to
enroll them in Medicare Part B„
Clara and Diaz are Cuban refugees who were
allowed to enter the country in 1971 under a special
Immigration Act provision permitting the temporary entry of
people in emergencies.

They are thus parollees and have not,

under the specific terms of the Immigration Actj been
admitted for permanent residence.
Espinosa is a Colombian who was admitted for
permanent resi.dence in June of 1971.
Thus, none of the Appellees are entitled to enroll
simply on the basis of their residence in this country as
they would be, if they were citizens.
Clcirc*. and Diaz applied for enrollment.
denied.

They were

Without asking for a rehearing, they brought this

suit for judicial review of the denial, claiming jurisdiction
under 42 U.S.C. 405G which, of course, is the same juris. ■»

■

dictional basis as was involved in Salfi.
Espinosa joined the suit and then filed a claim.
The three-judge district court found that the
administrative exhaustion required by 405G would be futile.

6

It then certified as a class all immigrants who
have been or will be denied enrollment in subpart B because
they are not aliens lawfully admitted for permanent
residence who have lived here for five years»
The court also established the subclass which was
represented only by the Appellee, Espinosa, consisting of
those who have been or will be denied enrollment solely
because of their failure to meet the five-year residency
requirements.
QUESTION:

Was that certification without regard

to whether the1members of the class had individually made
application to the Secretary or his delegates?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, necessarily, because it

included those who will be denied.
it was before Saif1.

There is no -— of course

There was no indication.

They then — the district Court then held the
entire alien eligibility requriement for Medicare Part B
unconstitutional and it permanently enjoined the Secretary
from relying on that requirement to deny enrollment to the
class members and after a short stay, the order became
effective in August, 1973 so the entire class was enrolled
arid has been insured since that time.
As

Salffl, there was no allegation that the

class members hed even filed an application with the
Secretary, much less that he had rendered any decision final

7

or otherwise, review of which was sought.

Thus, as in Saifi,

the class was improper.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, if you were to leave out

the "will be" part of the class and just limit it to the
"have been" would there be anyone in the class other than the
named plaintiff?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

The record doesn't show —

But wouldn't we have to assume as to

them that there had been applications which were denied?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, there certainly could have

been but there certainly was no ■— the district court made
the determination themselves that it felt that further
review by the Secretary would have been futile and felt, as
we indicate, that the Secretary must make that determination.
QUESTION:

What I really want to know is, is your

only objection to the class to the "will be" portion of it?
Or do you object to anything more than that?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, I don’t really think that

the class issue is a problem in this case.
Fox* one thing, because there was no stay, the
class members have been being paid — have been enrolled
and of course, the decision of this Court has jurisdiction
because the district court held the statute unconstitutional,
the same way as it was in Salfi.
The Secretary has determined — as in Salfi again

8
that there was jurisdiction because there was a final
decision over Clara and Diaz — I mean, there was final
administrative determination as to Clara and Diaz and this
Court's determination will bind the Secretary for the future
as to everybody,,
QUESTION:

Well, don't you argue that in any

event, the injunction was improper?

I gather at least two

of these three were properly before the district court.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Right.

But even assuming that they were

entitled to relief, I gather your submission is that the only
relief is

individually to have the Secretary's determination

reversed.

Is that right?

And that under no circumstances

were those two individuals entitled to any injunction.

Is

that right?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, yes.

Well, the —

Well, ■ suppose we disagree with you as

to those two and say now that the three-judge court was
right?

In this circumstance, what do we do?

Do we affirm

the injunction or not?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

As to those two?

Assume we conclude that the district

court correctly found the statute unconstitutional, in the
cases of those two individuals, Diaz and Clara.
do we do?

Then what

9

MRS. SHAPIRO'

I don't think that we object so

much to the form of the order; if the statute was
unconstitutional as to those two, then they properly
enrolled and —
QUESTION;

But the injunction, then, I gather, is

against the Secretary enforcing that provision as to anybody.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

The injunction is as to his enfor­

cing it specifically against the class
QUESTION:

members.

And you are content with that if we

affirm.
MRS. SHA/x'RO;

As a practical matter, it doesn't

really make any difference in this particular case.
Quz' main point, I suppose, on the class action
r

aspect is that the error —■ because the order wasn't stayed,
i.
V

*

the error has cost the government about $2 million, something
over $2 million in 1975 alone but essentially that is waterover the dam at. this point.
QUESTION:

But has that money been paid out on

application for benefits?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Yes.

Well, the way that figure

was arrived at, the government pays $7.50 a month in premiums
to match the $7.50 a. month that — I'm sorry, it is $6,70 a
month that is paid by each alien and then at the end of the
year, the government makes up any deficit in the trust fund
thac applies to this particular program

10

And the total cost of the benefits, the premium
costs and the make-up is $10„00.
QUESTION:

No, what I was trying to get at is,

what is the procedure by which the government learns it
has to match the alien's — a particular alien's $6.70?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, that's the statute.

I know, but how does the alien bring

to the attention of the Secretary that there is a duty

to

match that $6.70?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, that is by virtue of there

being an enrollment.
QUESTION:

That is enrollment.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Umn hmn.

Well, Mrs. Shapiro, I am still not clear

Did the class include some persons who had in the past been
d enied what the district court felt they were entitled to
but who had not in the past made some sort of application to
the Secretary?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The class definition is on page 50

and 51 of the Appendix and it includes "All immigrants
residing in the United States who have attained the age of
65 and who have been or will be denied enrollment in the
supplemental medical insurance program."
So it doesn't say anything about when they have
been denied.

11
QUESTION:

I am thinking about whether or not

this action is brought within 60 days after ■—
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

There is nothing about that* no.

Well, you object on that grounds then,

I take it.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

We think that the class was

improper, yes, on that grounds.

What happened after the

stay was dissolved was that the social security — the HEW
paid under order — or enrolled under the order everybody
whose applications were in the pipeline at that time.
They didn’t go back and pick up people who had
been denied more than 60 days before.
I think when you are thinking about the retro­
activity issue here, the whole class action issue, it is
kind of important to remember that what is involved here is
an application and then payment of a premium by

the

applicant and insurance from that point forward so that to
go back and say, well, you enrolled and we denied you but we
are going to reopen it and now you have to pay us the monthly
premiums and gat insurance for a period when you may or may
not have been sick, it --- it is a rather peculiar kind of a
retroactivity problem.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't get many takers

voluntarily, would you, on that?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Not unless they had been sick,,

12

The situation as to Espinosa is a little more
complicated.

He didn't apply for enrollment until after he

had joined the suit and because of the litigation and the
district court's injunction against denying him enrollment,
his application has, in fact, never been adjudicated.

It is

rather hard to see how there can have been a final decision
as to him submitting review under 405G but the Appellees
point out the Secretary has nevertheless, in effect,
stipulated that his claim had been finally denied.
That may not be an entirely accurate reading of
the stipulation originally made but we do agree that the
district court and the parties assumed before Salfi that
Espinosa's application was to be treated as if it had been
finally denied by the

Secretary.

The Secretary has concluded that but for the
injunction, the application would have been denied solely
because of Espinosa5s failure to meet the alienage provisions.
As a technical matter, we don't believe that the
stipulation here cures the lack of any decision, let alone a
final one.

But the circumstances of this particular case,

especially the fact that it was litigated before Salfi, may
justify reading the stipulation liberally and concluding that
the Secretary is now foreclosed from denying that there had
been a final denial of Espinosa’s claim sufficient to
satisfy 405G.

13

Perhaps the most important point here is the
wisdom of Saifi* s emphasis on the need for final administra­
tive decisions because when adjudication of Espinosa’s
application was interrupted,, there was some indication that
he was entitled to enroll because he had worked in covered
employment.

In fact, he had not.
But Saifi recognizes that 405G and H protect the

courts from being asked to consider constitutional issues
until that kind of factual question has been finally settled
administratively.
It is important that the Court not retreat from
that principle here.
QUESTION:

That is jurisdiction, isn’t it?

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

It is jurisdictional and —

If it is, unless the stipulation can

really be read as having been a denial by the Secretary, how
can the district court have jurisdiction of the Espinosa
claim?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the record on the stipulation

is really quite unclear and it is hard to read it as a
stipulation that there had been a final denial but as I say,
I think that it could perhaps be done.
And we would not object in this case to the
QUESTION:

Would the effect of that, Mrs. Shapiro,

be then like the efforts to confer jurisdiction by

14

stipulation?
MRS. SHAPIRO

No, because what the stipulation,

what you would be doing would be reading the stipulations
as a stipulation that there was a final decision.
QUESTION:

Which is the factual premise of

jurisdiction.

'

MRS. SHAPIROi

Yes.

I turn now to the merits.
QUESTION:

This case •—■

Does it really matter?

The merits are

here anyway in the other two cases, aren't they?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

In the Clara and Diaz cases?

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

They are —

whether we reach it or not in Espinosa.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
Dias.

Well —

The merits are there in Clara and

If Espinosa is out of the case they may have somewhat

more leeway in which ones of the various issues there are
that you can decide and settle the case.
This case involves both an alienage classification
and social welfare legislation.

The Solicitor General

explained this morning, why we believe that alienage
classifications of the sort involved here are simply not
subject to attack on equal protection grounds.

He argued

alternatively that if they are subject to such an attack,
only the most attenuated rational basis test is appropriate

15

and a narrow rational basis test is also appropriate here
because the case involves social welfare legislation and
Salfi is the most recent expression of that principle»
In that connection I want only to emphasize that
under the test

reaffirmed in Salfi, and as Mr. Justice

Stewart pointed out this morning, this Court need not
consider whether the asserted justification actually
motivated Congress in making the classification nor whether
a different classification would have served equally well.
The enrollment limitations here are rationally
related both to legitimate integration and social insurance
policies.
First, it is rational in terms of both policies
to treat aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence
differently from others who have not expressed their intent
to remain here indefinitely and have not submitted to the
screening necessary to establish their right to do so.
That distinction, we believe, is self-evidently
reasonable when applied to most non-immigrant aliens —
people like illegal entrants, diplomats, visitors, members
of

crews of foreign ships.
Certainly Congress is not constitutionally

required to provide subsidized medical insurance to such
temporary residents in this country just because it does so
for citizens.

16

It is also reasonable for Congress to conclude
that, parolees like Clara and Diaz should be treated like
temporary residents until they have been admitted for
permanent residence.
They were given refuge in this country without
prior screening because of emergency conditions.
The statute under which they entered specifically
requires their return to the country from which they came
when the emergency ends.,

They apparently wish

to regain

here permanently since they have applied for adjustment of
their status to that of permanent resident immigrants.
If they meet immigration standards, their status
will be adjusted retroactive to the time at which they
entered but until that has been done, they are here at the
discretion of the Attorney General for the duration of the
emergency and thus can reasonably be considered more like
temporary visitors than permanent residents.
The five-year residence requirement is also a
rational expression of immigration policies.

It is the

essence of congx-essional immigration policy to decide the
extent to which immigration will be encouraged.
A person considering immigration will normally
consider the cost of living in this country.

Part of that

cost is the cost of medical care and if subsidized
government insurance is available, the

cost will be lower

17
than if it is not„
If it is available after five years, the cost is
less than if it is not available at all.
<

Immigration of the elderly is thus encouraged by
making such insurance available to them but not encouraged
as much as if it were available immediately on entry.
Even more explicitly, the Immigration Act expresses
■w

the policy that aliens who are likely to become public
charges are not to be admitted as immigrants.

The practical

effect of that requirement for immigrants over 60 which is,;
of course, the people that are involved in the Medicare
eligibility provision is that they must either be economically
independent or have someone here who will assume responsi­
bility for their support.
But the Medicare limitation simply defines the
extent of that support obligation so the effect of the
Immigration statute and the Medicare

statute together is

the same as if Congress had provided explicitly in the
Immigration Act that elderly immigrants must undertake to
provide for their own medical care for five years, either
through private insurance or otherwise.
Congress could certainly have done that directly
through provisions in the Immigration Act.
Congress has an equal right to do it indirectly
through the Medicare Act.

18

We believe that the Court really need go no
farther than that to re-'ect the Petitioner’s claim but the
alien eligibility limitation also reflects valid social
welfare policies.
The fact that Medicare part B is available to all
citizens over 65 means that it supplements all the retirement
systems in the country, principally, of course, social
security, also the Railroad Retirement Act, the Civil Service
and even the military retirement provisions.
Medicare can’t reasonably be considered apart
from the system.

All are programs to provide for the elderly

in their retirement years.

All reflect a federal responsi­

bility to those who have contributed to the country over
their working years.

All are based in part on the individual

contributions of the workers and in part on taxes.
Since Medicate part B supplements all of them, the
federal contributions reasonably come from general revenues
rather than from taxes on individual employers, as they do
in the individual systems.
In any case, the mechanics of funding should not
obscure the fact that what is involved here is a supplement
to retirement systems.

Supplementary medical insurance, like

the systems which it supplements, is made available in
recognition of past contributions to the economy.
It is perfectly true that resident aliens, like

19

citizens, pay taxes and contribute in many other ways to our
economy.
Citizens ordinarily do so over their working lives
and when they become 65, they may enroll in Medicare Part B,
Congress concluded that an alien who has made
similar contributions for only five years may also enroll in
Medicare Part B at 65.
That is surely not discriminating against the
aliens in the allocation of tax funds.
The district court was troubled by the fact that
chronically indigent citizens,, who may never have paid taxes
or contributed in any way to the economy, are entitled to
Medicare while aliens like Appellees are not.
There are two answers to that concern.
First, as Saifi reminds us, Congress may use broad
classifications to avoid the administrative burdens of caseby-case determinations of eligibility.

Since entitlement to

Medicare is fundamentally based on entitlement to retirement
benefits and citizens are far more likely to meet this
requirement than aliens who are admitted within five years of
their application, it is reasonable to require proof of
eligibility only of the aliens and not of the citizens, even
currently indigent citizens.
But there is another 'justification for permitting
■-rollment of indigent citizens and not recent

20

immigrants.
Both provisions protect state welfare funds.

The

enrollment of indigents means that federal funds pay medical
expenses the states would otherwise have to pay.
Denial of Medicare to recent immigrants discourages
the entry of those most likely to become state charges.
The fact that the immigration laws have the same
effect with regard to the immigrants simply means that the
two acts are consistent.

It certainly doesn’t mean that

either is irrational.

•

'

Appellees emphasise that an elderly alien's need
for subsidised medical insurance is likely to be as great as
that of an elderly citizen and that is undoubtedly true
but they also claim that the only purpose of Medicare Part B
is to provide medical insurance to those who need it and
that is not true.
Legislative classifications in the social welfare
field almost always are the result of many considerations but
no social welfare classification can be made without balancing
needs against costs and these will vary from statute to
statute.
This, of course,, means that the classifications
made will vary from statute to statute.

For instance, in the

program providing for supplementary federal welfare payments
for elderly blind and disabled indigents, Congress provided

21
more generously for aliens than it did in the Medicare
statute and there it included all aliens who are in this
country under color of law but the needs and the costs that
were being evaluated in the welfare statute, at issue there,
were different and so a different balance was struck.
This Court has always recognized that making that
balance is a legislative function, not to be disturbed so
long as there is a rational -justification for it.
Here, the underlying -justification is that the
needs of those with a substantial relation to the country
are recognized but the needs of those whose relationship is
essentially temporary are not.
Congress drew a line which is reasonable in terms
of that justification.
The district court’s changing of that line is now
costing the government over $2 million annually and that
price will probably go up in the future.
Congress frequently reevaluates Medicare and it
may someday decide that Appellees' needs justify that burden
on the Treasury.
It hasn't done so yet.

And that is not a

decision for this Court.
I’d like to reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Rogov?.

Very well, Mrs. Shapiro.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S, ROGOW, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. ROGOW:

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The argument as to jurisdiction is contained in
our supplemental reply brief and I think after hearing
Mrs. Shapiro this afternoon, I think we are basically in
agreement.

There is clearly jurisdiction as to’ Diaz and

Clara and as I read Mrs,, Shapiro's position, there is a
concession that the government did stipulate to the finality
of the decision regarding Mr. Espinosa and that stipulation
as to finality therefore means that the Court has juris­
diction as to Espinosa.
The class matter, I think, is not really very
important;if the statute falls in this case as to Espinosa,

then it falls as to everyone.
But I think for the reasons I have pointed out
in my~supplemental brief, if you read the class as those who
have been denied, then Mr. Espinosa and others who have
applied and bean determined not eligible would be included.
I think the important part of this case obvious3.y
has to do with whether or not Congress can treat aliens and
discriminate against aliens in the way that the government
would like to have us believe.
The government attempts to cast this case as one

in which Congress has exercised its plenary power over
immigration and under the theory that the government advances,,
this, the statutory residence requirements in this case are
somehow linked to the plenary power over immigrations.
They encourage or discourage immigration.
If the government is right, every one of the 200
and some-odd statutes that they have listed in their appendix
to the Wong brief must then be read as somehow encouraging
or discouraging immigration with nothing more, no other
evidence to substantiate that, merely because they classify
based upon alienage.
What is fatal to the government's theory is that
that would require the court to indulge the assumption that
all of these statutory classifications based upon alienage
are somehow attempting to regulate admission or exclusion of
aliens and I give the Court one example, which I think
underscores the fallaciousness of that position.
Mrs. Shapiro

referred to the supplemental security

income statute, Title 42, United States Code, Section 1382.
In that statute, which provides aid to the aged,
blind and disabled, the government has not drawn a line that
precludes aliens from receiving those benefits.

People here

under color of law , conditional* entrants and parolees can
receive those benefits. Using the government’s logic, that
would mean that that statute in some way is seeking to

encourage immigration?

Obviously not.

At the most, what can be said for these statutes
is, that when they classify based upon alienage, that
classification perhaps is in some way related to the benefits
that the Government is extending.
In this case, for instance, I think quite frankly
what the government is doing, what the Congress has done in
this classification, is it has said that aliens with some
ties to this country will be entitled to certain

welfare

benefits, certain health care benefits.
It hasn't said this is encouraging or discouraging
immigration.

It is not related at all to immigration and I

think that if one then strips the constitutional cloak of
immigration power, of plenary power from this case, we coma
up with a statute that in many ways resembles tfie statutes
struck down by this Court in Graham versus Richardson, statues
which provide important welfare or health care benefits and
then discriminate against a class of people, aliens.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Rogow, what about, what would

you have to say about the class of people who are clearly
illegally

in the United States, smuggled in one way or

another, which various reports have indicated are a very
large number of people, whatever the figure may be.
MR. ROGOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, those people

certainly would not be included within those who would obtain

benefits under this statute»
QUESTION:

They are not people —

Then they are discriminated against,

aren’t they?
Their pains and their needs are the same, are
they not?
MR., ROGOW:

But those people are not in the

country with any kind of legal status at all.

They are

illegal.
QUESTION:

Well, than, your people that you are

talking about here now, are here with a status but qualified
by the very process that admitted them, are they not?
MR,, ROGOW:

Only Diaz and Clara I believe you are

speaking of, Mr., Chief Justice.

Mr. Espinosa is here lawfully

admitted for permanent residence under the immunity of the
immigration law.,
QUESTION:

I am speaking of the other two, in

that class.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir.

They are here in a special

category but it is certainly not the same category as those
who sneak in the country or those who jump ship and come into
the country.

Their category is one

QUESTION:

Well, you put considerable emphasis

on the needs of people but you can’t distinguish between the
needs of an illegal alien and one who is here under conditional
grant, can you?

Or 021® who is here with no conditions

all.

26

MRe ROGOW:
^

Mo, sir, the needs for medical care

may be the same, but if we use the government's position,
»

*

which is that there is some requirement that Congress can
impose for there being some tie to the country, those people
could legitimately be excluded: People who fall into what is
known as the non-immigrcinfc category, visitors, visiting
journalists who are just on assignment to this country, those
people have no ties to the country and perhaps it is

we

would agree that it is legitimate for Congress to draw a
line in that way.
It is rationally related to the purpose of the
>

program which is to provide medical care to those who have
some ties.
QUESTION:

What are the ties of this category of

people who may be ejected from the country when political
conditions in their point of origin permit it?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

The difficulties of —
What are the ties of such people?

They

are temporary, but the time frame is merely longer, is it not?
MR. ROGOW: No, I don't think the time —
QUESTION: Why are they different from a journalist

^

who is over here to spend six months studying our welfare
system?
MR. ROGOW:
elsewhere.

Because the journalist has his home

These P®°Plc nave their homes here.

These people

27
have their residences here.
QUESTION:

Well, now, you say that, but they

have homes elsewhere, too, even though those homes may have
been confiscated.
MR. ROGOW:

If one looks at the definition of

residence under Title VIII, Section 1101 of the Immigration
Law, residence means the place of general abode, the principal
actual dwelling place in. fact without regard to intent, by
the way.

But it is the actual dwelling place in fact and

if one is going to look for definitions, one looks there, the
refugees in this case have their principal places of abode
here.
I don't want to get tied to Immigration Law in
this case because it is not an -immigration case.

We are

saying, Mr. Chi^f Justice, with regard to those special
people, Diass and Clara, we are saying that the lawfullyadmitted provision as applied to them is unconstitutional
because it is not rationally related to the purpose of the
statute and the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of
the statute is to provide medical care to the elderly who
have some ties to the country.
They are excluded under the statute.

That

exclusion is irrational, given the purpose of the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, now, you say and then restate

that they have ties to the country

Their tie to the

country is conditioned, is it not, by the fact that they are
admitted as temporary political refugees, subject to
exclusion and return to Cuba when it is politically feasible
for them to do so without danger,.

Isn't that a fair state­

ment of their status here?
MR. RGGOW:
QUESTION:
MR. RGGOW:

Technically, it is a fair statement.
Well, non-technically, then, what —
I don't think it is a fair statement.

I don’t think that the government -QUESTION:
MR. ROGOW:

Why not?
Because I don't think that the Cuban

refugees -- who have a very unique status in this country.
There are many, many statutes providing all kinds of benefits,
resettlement benefits to them, placement benefits, job
training benefits —QUESTION:

Those are all express actions are they

not?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Here you have an express action

that cuts the other way.
MR. ROGOW:
as applied to them.

It doesn't cut directly the other way
It precludes them.

But in response to

your question, Mr. Chief

Justice, which is, are these people temporarily here and
Wsuld they be excluded — the hypothetical you gave me requires

29

me to indulge the assumption that they will be excluded
when political conditions change in Cuba.
I don't think that I can agree with that
assumption.

I don't think that Mr. Diaz, who is 80 years old

and Mr. Clara are going to be excluded from the country if
the Castro regime falls in Cuba.

I just don't think that, as

a practical matter.
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOWs
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOW:

Well, how do you know that?
I don't know that but -Then we can't know it, either.
I believe it is -- your question,

Mr. Chief Justice, is whether or not they are here temporarily
and are going to be excluded and I can't agree that I know
that they will be excluded.
Their home is here.

My point is, they are here.

Their ties are here and if we take the

government's submission to the Court as being the proper one.
that the government is requiring scree ties, these people
have the ties.
Now, I must say that that is only one part.

There

are two classes involved here.
There are aliens who have not been hare for five
years who are not in the same category as Messrs. Dias and
Clara.
I think that all of these people are entitled
to the constitutional protections of the Fifth Amendment and

30

I think that when one looks at Graham versus Richardson,
the reason why they are entitled to it becomes obvious
because these people, who are in the country under color of
law are the prime example of a discrete and insular minority.
That is the suspect classification test.
the suspect classification test is right.
one that should be applied to this group

We think

We think that is
of aliens and

Mr. Bork this morning, I think, tried to frighten the Court
away from adopting the suspect classification test by
saying that all of these statutes listed in his appendix to
the Wong brief might then fall.
I think Mr. Bork was wrong and X think Mr. Bork's
fears

were unfounded.

Many of those statutes may be justi­

fied as exercises of power over foreign affairs, as exercises
of power to protect national security, as exercises of power
to protect vital resources and so X don't think that
utilising suspect

classification will result a fortiorari

in the destruction of the constitutionality of those statutes.
Now, even if the rational

basis test is the test

that ought to be used in this case, we think that these
statutory classifications do not pass constitutional muster.
Weinberger versus Salfi has been cited this after­
noon and Weinberger versus Salfi is the case, the most
recent case, which talks about the rational basis test and
how it is utilised and 1 think that when one looks at

Weinberger versus Salfi and compares it to this case, one
sees why the statutory residence requirements here fall and
they did not fall in Salfi.
For instance, in Salffi, there was a long legisla­
tive history which showed that Congress was concerned with
abuses of the social security system that resulted from sham
marriages.

Salfi involved the duration of relationship

requirement.

One had to be married for nine months in order

to secure social security benefits if one’s spouse died.
p

There was a presumption that if you were married
for more than nine months, it was not a marriage entered
into for the purpose of securing those benefits so there is
that long legislative history that there has —
QUESTION:

Well, I don't think it is a long

legislative history at all.

As I recall, it is about a

paragraph, isn't it?
MR. ROGOW:

My impression from your opinion,

Mi*. Justice Rehnquist, is that you certainly found that there
was much testimony in the Congressional hearings that there
had been abuses and people were entering into sham marriages.
QUESTION;

Well, that factor was there but I think

it was dealt with fairly shortly in the legislative history.
MR. ROGOW;

But no matter how long it was, it

was the legislative history that showed there were abuses
and Congress was seeking to protect the system against those

32

abusos.
QUESTION:

Do you disagree, then, with the import

of Mr. Justice Stewart's question in the earlier case that
the test is any conceivable set of facts that would support
this distinction?
You say, in effect, that Congress must have
manifested its concern.
MR. RQGOW:

I say that because in every case tha

Court has looked to see if there is some way to conclude
that. Congress had some concern.

I am not saying that

Congress must have manifested it by coming out with a long
nrenmble to a statute which says, this is why we did it, but
there must bo something in the record that justifies the
congressional classification„
OUESTION:

Well, but what do you do with the

tost in cases like McGowan against Maryland, which simply
says, "If, on any conceivable-hypothetical state of facts,
this discrimination can be justified, it survives the equal
protection tost.''
t". ROGOM:

McGowan versus Maryland, as I recall,

is the Hundny Closing Lav; case and one distinction that I
would mnko between McGowan versus Maryland is that, one, we
have a little different — two different things to consider
here „
One is that there are people, aliens, a class

33

that i-5 affected and it is not the sane kind of thing that
was was being affected in McGowan versus .Maryland.
QUESTION:

Well, then, are you saying that the

rational basis test, when applied to people, as you concede
it to bo, is not the same test as when it is applied to
merchants who have to close on Sundays?
smo ROGOV?:

I see the difficulties in taking that

position but quite candidly I think that there must be •— the
rational basis test is not a very precise test.
cannot apply it mechanically to everything.

One

I think one

must take into consideration the factors that come into
play and i think, yes, the factor there are- people involved
here and they are aliens and in fact, there are important
health care benefits involved here that may be essential
to the very life of these people.
QUESTION:

Well, are the merchants somehow that

were forced to close in McGowan less people than the aliens
hero?
ROGOW:
don’t

No, they are not less people but they

form a class that this Court has, in the past, looked

at very carefully whenever legislation has been implemented
to dealing with it.
QUESTION:

Well, by hypothesis, when you are

applying the rational basis test, you have already said that
it is not a suspect classification.

If it is a suspect

34

classification,, presumably you don't have to defend on the
rational basis test.
HR. ROGOTV:

I agree but I think that once one

recodes, if the Court says it is not a suspect classification,
I still think there can be some heightened judicial solici­
tude .
QUESTION:

You

MR. ROGOW:

recede only step-by-step.

Yes, sir, T do.
i

[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

And how about the people who are

customers of the stores who closed on Sunday?
state injury?

Have they no

Are they entitled to no consideration?

MR. ROGGY:

I think that they could shop on

other days, other than Sunday and if there is a harm that
Retails them, it is perhaps not as substantial as those who
are denied important health care benefits when they are over
65 and need those benefits in order to protect their very
life.

I think there is- a difference.
OUrdTIQN:

You don't think there are any sub­

stantial number of People who reallv can't do their shopping
except on Qundav,
,<fn. ROGOYs

Oh, there may be a number of people.

I don't know how substantial, Mr. Chief Justice, but once
aasirt, I don't think -'MJEf.TION:

Apparently it is enough to justify

35

most of the supermarkets staying open on Sundays now.
MR. ROHOW:

I think it is.

I think the purpose

of that obviously is, not only to satisfy the needs of those
people, but the economic needs of the supermarkets»
dhen one looks again at Salfi, and I think Salfi
is very important in making our argument here, in Salfi
there were other ob-jective evidences which could be shown
to avoid the presumption that the marriage was not a sham.
That does not appear in this case at all.
In other words, in Salfi, if a person had
children by the marriage or had adopted children by the
marriage, no matter how short it may have been before the
death of the spouse, then there was a way around that
irrebuttable presumption in Salfi.
In this case, there is no way around it.

People

\

who do have ties to the country

people who have come here

have to wait five years no matter how strong the ties are
to the country and so once again we have an example that
Congress has not really been very precise in trying to meet
the legitimate legislative roles that may have been involved
and oxxa final example of the preciseness in Salfi, which I
believe led this Court to uphold the statute in Salfi is
that Congress had reduced the requirement, the marriage
requirement from one year to nine months because there had
been evidence that some people who had been married for more

3G
than nine months but leas than a year were being excluded
from social security benefits even though the marriages were
not sham? another example of Congress trying to be precise
and while it has power to draw lines, the Court looked at
that power and said, the power was exercised in a very
precise and definite way and the lines that were drawn were
not irrational.
We think that using that analysis and applying
it to this case, one must come to the conclusion that the
lines are far too broad, cut much too harshly and are there­
fore irrational,.
The argument we make, which is an argument
really based upon —
QUESTION:
MR, ROGOWs
QUESTION;

Let me interrupt at this point.
Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens.
I want to be sure I understood your

colloquy with the Chief Justice.
As I understand it, you would not have attacked
the first requirement of lawfully admitted for permanent
residence if it were not for the wards, "For permanent
residence."

You would agree that Congress could rationally

distinguish between illegal and legal -- a legally-presenfc
alien.
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens.
And as to the five years, I take it

37
you would agree chat Congress could have drawn a line of,
sav, six months?
*4R.

ROGO.J:

X think the sax months requirement

would be much more difficult for mo to try to overcome.
QUESTION:

Well, would you agree they could have

drawn it at 30 days?
MR.

ROGOW:

QUESTION:

Yes.
You would anree they could draw some»

lines?
mr„

POGO’I:

QUEGTION:

Yes, I think so.
And that line would be equally precise

with the one that they did draw but it would just be a
shorter line, that is all.
MR. ROGOW;

But we would

then be able to come to

the conclusion that the line was drawn with some concern
for the people who were going to be entitled to those
benefits.

Requiring 30 days, for instance, would perhaps

show that Congress was trying to draw a fine line so that
it would not harm people who were elderly who come to this
country lawfully and were in need of
QUESTION:

Well, at this tine fewer people

because of the difference in five years and 30 days.
MR. ROGOW:

That is right, Mr. Justice Stevens,

and in Half! there were some people who obviously were
married less than nine months but ware still going to be

33

preclude;!.
Congress does not have to meet every need of
every person but it must at least draw the line in a narrow
way so that it does not engage in the wholesale kind of
exclusions which are here.
OUESTIQN:

But the test, as 1 understand you,

is the significance of the relationship between this
country and the alien.

Thirty days is all right, but a

s

longer — it is still the same yardstick, is it not?
MR. ROGOW:

I am not happy with 30 days.

I

mean, I would have a great deal of difficulty in standing
before the Court and objecting to the 30-day requirement.
I think there is another way that could accomplish the
purpose.

Of course, this would be the way for Congress to

do but for instance, one could draw the line between — one
could draw the line at those listed in a non-immigrant
category under the Immigration Law which, by definition
would exclude all of those temporary people.
But if, instead, Congress drew the lino at 30
days, I would then have to say that in 30 days, of course,
you probably couldn’t even get enrolled in the 3G~day period
so that might net be such a bad law.
QUESTION:

No, but within the 30 days, they do

become persons entitled to the protection of the Fifth
Amendment.

39

MR» ROGOWs

Within one day of being admitted

they become persons.
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOWt

Correct.
Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens.

The argument we are making Is not —

MR. ROGQWs
QUESTION:
MR. ROGGW'i

I certainly —
Isn't that true?
I certainly believe, Mr. Justice,

that a parson who immigrates to this country, who' on 'the
moment ha leaves Ellis Island and steps Into New York, for
instance and. says, "I have cut off all' ties with -my homeland.
This is my new land and I will make it my land for the rest
of my life," that person has

substantial and enduring ties.

Dess Congress have to draw the line there?

It

»

would be nice if they did.

It would most accurately reflect

what the purpose that the government is suggesting is.
But if it didn't draw the lino quit® there, I
would net b© able to say that it would be totally irrational
and of course, all of this discussion is premised on th©
assumption

that a rational basis test is the

appropriate

on© and not the compelling interest test, a point which

I do

40
not, of course, agree with.
The argument we are making i© not a novel on®.
In 1886, in Tick Wo versus Hopkins, the Court
held that aliens were entitled to the benefit© of the 14th
Amendment.
In 1896, in l?ong Wing versus United State®, th©
Court held that aliens wore entitled to th© benefits of th©
Fifth Amendment.
Our argument is an amalgam of the 14th and th©
5th Amendments and we are saying that aliens today ought
to be entitled to the Constitution, just as aliens ©£ th®
past century were entitled to the benefits of th® Consti­
tution and we believe that th® eases that this Court has
decided recently dealing with aliens ar® most persuasive in
affirming the decision of'th® court below.
