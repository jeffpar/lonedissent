MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will heii. arguments

first this morning in United States against Miller, 74-1179.
Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
CN BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves Fourth Amendment claims
concerning two Grand Jury subpoenas of bank records.
In January of 1973, while fighting a fire at a
warehouse in Kathleen, Georgia, which was rented to the
Respondents, local law enforcement officials discovered a
distillery, a quantity of non-tax-paid whiskey and related
paraphernalia.
Several weeks earlier, a van-type truck, occupied
by two of Respondents later-alleged coconspirators, was
stopped on the basis of information from an informant and
found to contain distillery apparatus.
As a result cf these two incidents, two Grand
Jury subpoenas were issued from the United States'
Attorney's Office to banks in nearby communities in which
Respondents had bank accounts.

This was in the conduct of

the investigation being conducted by the United States'

4
Attorney's Office and Treasury Department agents on behalf
of the Grand Jury.
The obvious purpose of the subpoenas was to
determine whether the record of the Respondent's account
would reflect transactions that would connect him with the
maintenance or operation of the distillery discovered during
the fire with its proceeds and that would connect that
operation with the van that had been stopped a few weeks
earlier.
And I would like to interject at the outset that
this is a normal method

of investigating an instance of

this kind and we believe an entirely proper line of
investigation.

If anything, a major thrust of this Court's

criminal procedures in the past 40 years has been to
encourage law-enforcement officials to seek objective,
reliable, documentary or real evidence of this sort from
certain parties rather than focus

the investigation

entirely on trying to elicit incriminating statements from
the suspects themselves.
QUESTION:

These subpoenas were issued at the

behest of the Treasury Department, were they?
MR. WALLACE:

They were issued — yes, they were

cooperating with the United States Attorney in the conduct
of the investigation, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

So these were --

MR. WALLACE:

So this was non-tax-paid whiskey

that had been discovered.
QUESTION:

And is it the theory of the Government

that this was a criminal investigation or an income tax
investigation?
MR. WALLACE:

It was an investigation.

What was

issued was subpoenas on behalf of the Grand Jury, a
criminal investigation — the Grand Jury investigation.
And the subpoenas were issued out of the United States
Attorney's Office.

No inquiry was made at the hearing and’

in the absence of evidence to the contrary, presumably
these subpoenas were issued in compliance with Rule 17 of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides
for their issuance in blank by the Clerk of the Court to
parties to proceedings.

This has been applied to Grand

Jury trials.
QUESTION:

These were Treasury Department

agents, though, weren't they?
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, they were assisting, as FBI

agents often assist the U. S. Attorney in the conduct of
the investigation preparatory to Grand Jury proceedings.
In this case it was a federal offense that the
Treasury Department is concerned with in its investigations.
The banks —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the rule,

6

Mr. Wallace, that requires a member of the Bar to request
the subpoena, that is, to physically receive it from the
clerk or may a member of the Bar send a messenger for a
Grand Jury subpoena?
MR. WALLACE:

The rule doesn't specify,
i

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

But it does authorize the issuance —

MR. WALLACE:

Of the subpoenas to —

QUESTION:

to a lawyer.

MR. WALLACE:

To attorneys.

The rule is really

drafted for trial subpoenas and has been applied by analogy
to Grand Jury subpoenas but the drafting doesn't fit the
Grand Jury situation precisely.
In ary event, it is the normal practice to have
these subpoenas in the United States Attorney's Office for
issuance on behalf of the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:
them

Well, Mr. Wallace, he can subpoena

himself, can't he — the U. S. Attorney?
MR. WALL7*CE:

He could issue a trial subpoena,

yes.
QUESTION:

But in the investigation he has to

use a Grand Jury subpoena?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:
Jury?

That is the normal method used.

If the case never goes to the Grand

7
MR. WALLACE:

The case may not go to the Grand

Jury but the idea is seeking information that can be
presented to the Grand Jury.

Sometimes the case proceeds

by information rather than indictment.

Eventually this one

did go to the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose this man in this case,

his lawyer wanted to subpoena somebody?

He could not do

it, could he?
MR. WALLACE:

Not until proceedings have been

brought.
QUESTION:

So it does not apply equally to both,

does it?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

It does —

At the Grand Jury.

MR. WALLACE:

— in application to trial

proceedings, but not in —
QUESTION:

At the Grand Jury proceedings it only

applies to the Government.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it is the Grand Jury subpoena.

This is the way the Grand Jury subpoenas evidence so that
it can function.
QUESTION:
it up.

I thought you said anybody could pick

That is not true^.
MR. WALLACE:

No, not anybody.

The subpoena is

issued by the Clerk of the Court to the attorney for the

8

Grand Jury, who is the United States Attorney and it is
issued in blank and then filled out at the United States
Attorney, acting on behalf of the Grand Jury, seeks
evidence for presentation to the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

It doesn't go to the Grand Jury

unless he decides so.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is correct, although

in this case the evidence did go to the Grand Jury.

Often

there is voluminous evidence only some of which would be
pertinent to the Grand Jury proceedings, after it is
screened.
QUESTION:
or ask the U. S,

Could the Grand Jury itself direct

Attorney to subpoena a particular witness

that it wanted, to hear?
MR. WALLACE:

It certainly could, or it could

issue a subpoena on its own but in a situation like this
one in particular where the Grand Jury is not in
continuous session — in fact, it sits infrequently.

This

is a non-urban area and the Grand Jury sessions are
infrequent and of short duration.
The common thing is for the United States
Attorney to act on its behalf and gather the evidence for
presentation to the Grand Jury.

Otherwise, service on the

Grand Jury, which often entails long distances of driving
for people in a rural district of this kind would become a

9

very burdensome thing.
Well, in thi3 case, the banks complied with the
subpoena without actually attending a Grand Jury session
by handing the information over to the agent working with
the United States Attorney so that it could be then
presented by them to the Grand Jury later on.
The Grand Jury did indict Respondent and four
others on five counts of violations related to the operation
of the distillery.
A pretrial motion to suppress evidence secured
by the subpoenas was denied by the trial court and at the
trial some evidence procured by these subpoenas was
introduced and the subpoenas also gave the investigators
some leads that may have; led to other evidence introduced
at the trial and the Respondent was convicted on all five
counts with which he was charged with concurrent sentences
of three years imprisonment.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in effect, held
that his pretrial motion to suppress should have been
granted on the three grounds asserted in that motion and
the Government's petition for rehearing was denied by an
eight to seven vote of the Court of Appeals.
In our view, the basic error cf the Court of
Appeals, the panel's opinion and decision in this case, is
in its holding that the alleged defects in the subpoena

10
violated, as that Court put, the Respondent's right to
privacy in the banks' recordsof his account.
It seems to us that this holding departs from
this Court's admonition in Katz against the United States
that the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a
general constitutional right to privacy.
The pertinent language of the Fourth Amendment
that we are concerned with in this case is on page 2 of
our brief, the right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable
searches and seizures shall not be violated.
Now, Katz held that that right to be secure in
one's person includes security from unreasonable intrusion
by the uninvited ear of the government as well as other
protection but neither Katz nor any other case in the
court has ever held that these protections apply to
anything other than, the claimant's own person, houses,
papers or effects.
In fact, the rule has been precisely the
0

contrary — the Fourth Amendment

does not protect what is

often referred to as jus tertii interests, that it is only
the person, papers, house or effectis are the subject of the
search standing to complain of non-compliance with the
Fourth Amendment, not someone against whom that evidence
may later be used.

11
This has been reiterated time and again.
The modern cases that spell it out start with
Goldstein against the United States and go on through Jones,
Wong Sun and Alderman, all of which are quite specific on
this point, and the Court has also applied this doctrine
with specific reference to the papers of third parties that
concern transactions between those third parties and the
person seeking to complain

of the intrusion of those

papers.
That was done in both Donaldson against the
United States involving a former employer's records
concerning Donaldson and then later in California Bankers
against Shultz where the Court pointed out that as long ago
as 1925 it had decided that an Internal Revenue summons
directed to a third party bank was not a violation of the
Fourth Amendment rights of either the bank or the person
under investigation by the taxing authorities and then
quoted with approval Mr. Justice Douglas' statement con­
curring in Dore.ldson the.t it is difficult to see how the
summoning of c third party and the records of a third
party can violate the rights of the taxpayer, even if a
criminal prosecution is contemplated or in progress, which
seems to us to be directly on point here.
As the Court also pointed out in Couch against
the United States, the landmark precedent concerning the

12
Fourth Amendment protection of

private papers, Boyd

against the United States did not contemplate -- the Court
said in Couch — the divergence of ownership and possession
of the papers and a fortiorari, it did not contemplate the
complete lack of possession or ownership of the papers by
the person making the complaint, which is the situation
here.
These records are owned and maintained by the
bank.

They are the bank's records —
QUESTION:

Well, Couch was a Fifth Amendment

case, wasn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, there was also a Fourth

Amendment claim in Couch which the Court rejected and
discussed.

It is true that this case is only a Fourth

Amendment case but I don't think that makes Couch less a
precedent for it that it rejected claims under both
amendments, Mr. Justice..
So the papers themselves belong to the bank.
The papers which the bank could consent to a search of
without any right of the; Petitioner to prevent the bank
from voluntarily turning them over to the Government under
this Court's consent search cases and this leaves only the
question whether, because the information was secured from
the Petitioner's checks — and in the course of transactions
between the Petitioner and the bank, whether that information

13
somehow protected it or whether Petitioner has standing
to claim that the information cannot be disclosed by the
bank to the government.
This is, in our view, rrot really a Fourth
Amendment claim but because the Fourth Amendment does not
protect against the disclosure of the information itself,
that was pointed out in United States against White, that
the person with whom one had the conversation in Katz could
later testify about it as long as it was a non-privileged
conversation and not a confidential communication within a
privileged relationship.
The protection of the information itself is
really the providence of the law of testimonial privileges
for confidential communications and here there is no such
privilege recognised between a bank and a bank customer
any more than there is between an individual and his
accountant or others with whom he conducts business trans­
actions .
QUESTION:
privilege?

What if state law recognized such a

Would that be conclusive as to the disposition

of a federal question such as this?
MR. WALLACE:

I don't believe so, Mr. Justice,

because whether such a privilege would be honored in the
federal courts or would bar the testimony of bank officials
as to their transactions: with an individual would be a

14
question of federal law and the Federal Rules of Evidence
would, of course, bear on it but no state, to my knowlege,
recognizes such a testimonial privilege.
There may be some rights of confidentiality in
one's bank records as against disclosure to third persons
but that doesn't mean that there is a testimonial privilege
to refuse, in response to proper legal process, to testify
about — after all, these are the bank's own transactions
and they have been a common source of evidence in both
state and federal criminal prosecutions for many, many
years, as the Court recognised in California Bankers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, you would make the same

answer if there ware a contract between the bank and the
customer that the bank v/ould resist every effort to divulge
the —
MR. WALLACE:

The answer would be the same.

There might be some contractual rights there, some basis
for a suit for breech of contract, but a contract can't
amend the legal process that is provided for by Congress
under the Federal Rules for Criminal Procedure for
securing evidence and —
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, was the customer of the

bank notified in this Ccse of the issuance of the subpoena?
MR. WALLACE:

He was not notified by either the

United States Attorney or by the bank — or by either bank.

15
QUESTION:

I suppose a bank could adopt a policy

of notifying customers whenever a customer's record is
subpoenaed but I take it your position would be that the
customer

would have no standing to go into court at that

point and attempt to enjoin the implementation of the
subpoena, let's say, on the ground that it was a fishing
expedition or otherwise invalid.
MR. WALLACE:

No standing under the Fourth

Amendment, Mr. Justice.
We don't address the possibility of standing
under the First Amendment if the allegation — which isn't
made here — is that this is an improper inquiry into its
associational activities or that sort of thing.
QUESTION:

I suppose the depositor would have

standing to bring a proceeding to enjoin the bank from
complying with the subpoena if he thought that there was no
legal duty to do so.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, in this case —

Or I suppose the bank was really not

required to turn the records over at the time it did turn
them over.
MR. WALLACE:

It was not required to do so.

It

could have —
QUESTION:

If there had been a contract, I

suppose the depositor could have prevented them from doing
so.

16
MR. WALLACE:

Well, whether that kind of a

contractual remedy would be a proper way of interfering
with the execution of federal processes is something that
doesn't have to be readied in this case.
QUESTION:

At least the depositor would have

standing to do so, to raise the issue in the court.
MR. WALLACE:

He would have standing to be able

to bring such a suit but he may not have a cause of action
there.
But here there was no problem of that sort and,
indeed, what the district court said was that the bank had
realy voluntarily handed the records over after receiving
the subpoena.
Now, there is some discussion in the Court of
Appeals opinion of the Bank Secrecy Act which, in our view,
doe3 not change the situation.

We are not involved hare

with the reporting requirements of that Act which were the
concerns expressed in the concurring opinion in California
Banker's of Mr. Justice Powell joined by Mr, Justice Blackmon.
We are concerned here only with the record­
keeping requirements and those requirements don't change the
fact that the records belong to the bank and are records of
its own financial transactions.
I don't see c;ny basis on which those record­
keeping requirements would lead to a

difference in the

17
result on this issue.
Now, our basic position, therefore, is that
that should

have been the end of the matter in the Court

of Appeals, that the complaint by the Respondent about
alleged defects in the subpoena should not

have been

entertained.
We do not urge, however, that that should be the
end of the matter in this Court if the Court agrees with
us because the Court of Appeals went on to hold that the
subpoenas were defective in three respects and we would
urge the Court to consider the course of action here that
it adopted in Donaldson where, after holding that
Mr. Donaldson did not have a right to intervene, to contest
the validity'of the Internal Revenue summons, nonetheless,
because of the importance of the issue to the administration
of justice anc the fact that it had been presented to the
Court, went on to decide that the summons was being used
for a proper purpose in any event, which was the issue
that Mr. Donaldson had sought to revise through his
attempted intervention.
Here, there is even more reason to go on and
comment about these alleged defects in the subpoena because,
unlike the situation in Donaldson, there is a holding by the
Court of

Appeals on this subject which, while technically

would be vacate?^ is still a holding that would be very

18

troublesome in the

administration of criminal justice in

the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

What case was it, Mr. Wallace, if you

remember, within the lasst year or 18 months in which the
Senate Committee, in conducting an inquiry, had subpoenaed
bank records of an organization which it was investigating that is, they were investigating the organization and the
sources of its —
MR. WALLACE:

United Servicemen’s Fund against
/

Eastland, I believe.
QUESTION:
have you?

Yes.

You haven't cited that — or

I couldn’t find it in —
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

I don’t recall if I did.

Well, it is not important.

Do you

think it has any bearing here?
MR. WALLACE:

It is not one of the cases most

closely on point, because it -—
QUESTION:

Wasn’t there a standing issue of the

organization -- of the depositor there?
MR-, WALLACE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But the

case was primarily about, the scopa of the debate clause and
it was a case which raised First Amendment claims rather
than Fourth Amendment claims so it seemed to us not as —
QUESTION:

Well, the privacy issue would be

common to both, would it not?

Wasn't that the claim of

19

the United Servicemen's Organization, that this was a
violation of their right of privacy and that it would open
to public gaze the members?
MR. WALLACE:

That was their claim but in the

context of the First Amendment claim and here we are
dealing with the Fourth Amendment claim which, as I said
earlier, we don't equate with the claim to the right to
privacy.

It is a claim about improper intrusion into the

person's papers and effects which are not the Respondent's.
That seems to us to be an end of the matter with
respect to the standing to raise that kind of claim.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, could I go back to your

standing argument for a minute?

Does it really make any

difference whose papers they were, as long as they were in
the custody of the bank?
You seem to stress the fact that they were the
bank's papers but I am not sure that is relevant.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, under Couch, even if they

were the Respondent's papers, if he had relinquished
possession of them to the bank. —
QUESTION:

What I am asking is, would your

standing argument be precisely the same regardless of who
owned the papers?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it just adds to the fact that

there is — it is sort of an a fortiorari argument since

20

the papers are not in the Respondent's possession,
actual or constructive.

There is no basis for asserting

a possessory interest in them and Couch disposes of his
claim on that ground alone but we never took the position
in Couch that Mrs. Couch couldn't be heard to assert the
claim that she still had constructive possession over her
records so that there is more of a basis for standing to
complain in the owner o:: the records.
If there is a proprietary interest, I think
there is some implication in Donaldson also that that can be
a basis for a standing to complain, which may well be
rejected on the merits, as it was in both of those cases.
QUESTION:

As my brother White pointed out

earlier, Couch was a Fifth Amendment case, at least it was
both a Fourth Amendment and a Fifth Amendment case and —
MR.-WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

— the questions of standing might

be resolved differently under the Fifth Amendment from
they might be under the Fourth.
MR. WALLACE:

They might wall.

They might well.
QUESTION:

Well —

You said we rejected in Couch the

Fifth Amendment claim,
MR. WALLACE:
claim.

As well as the Fourth Amendment

That was also rejected in Couch.

21

QUESTION:

But the Fourth Amendment claim in

Couch considered the nature of the records as well, not just
ownership or possession and indicated that these papers
weren't private papers anyway — even if he owned them.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct.

So that is a somewhat different

approach than some rigid rule about not having possession
or ownership.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, because in that case they

were the Complainant's records.

There was ownership and

we have in our brief analogized to those considerations
in Couch by pointing out. that the checks here are cast
upon a sea of commerce over which the Respondent has no
control.
Now, I do think have to — and he has no
control over the endorsements, who will see the information,
et cetera.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, when you say that, that

doesn't apply to deposits or —
MR. WALLACE:

No, it applies only to checks.

It doesn't apply to the deposit slips.

But even where

privilege has been recognized for confidential communica­
tionis, it has been held not to apply to transactions buonly to confidential communications — transactions between
the attorney and. client, the amount of the fee and the

22

identity of the client have held not to be privileged under
the attorney-client privilege, for example.
I'll have to leave to our brief the discussion
of the alleged defects of the subpoena and I'll reserve
the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rampey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENVER LEE RAMPEY, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. RAMPEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
My name is Lee Rampey.

I represent the

Respondent in this case — ever since this whole <case
started.
Let me vary quickly make a factual condensation
of this case in regards to these subpoenas.

I think the

Appendix that the Court has before it is withir- about 6 0
pages in length and it will show that the subpoenas were
apparently completed and, as the government concedes,
'issued in the United States Attorney's Office.

Two Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms agents came and picked up the subpoenas,
one issued to the C and C Bank of Warner Robins, Georgia,
\

}

one to the Bank of Byron — two small, state-type banks
though a lot of this is federally regulated and subject
to the Bank Secrecy Act.
They went there.

They served the subpoenas.

At

23
the C and S Bank of Warner Robins, the aqent secured all
of the information he asked for over a four-month period.
Copies of the check, financial statement, deposit
slips, everything he requested in regards to Miller's
financial transactions at the C and S Bank of Warner Robins,
those —
QUESTIONS:

Is it your point that it makes some

difference whether the United States Attorney did it
personally or sent an FBI agent or a United States Marshal
t

or one of his secretaries?
MR. RAMPEY:

Your Honor, I think Rule 17 is

couched in terms of a party requesting a subpoena in blank
and it being used in that manner.

The reason I am going

over this point is to show that, really, as a practical
matter, the only people that knew what was going on as to
these documents --- the use of these subpoenas, was the
ATp sc/ents and, to some unknown extent, the United Stcifces
Attorney's office because here, the ATF agent retained the
documents that he secured from the two banks in his
possession from the time that he received them until the
time of the hearing.
In the Appendix at pages 41 and 42, tie agent
is sitting right there on the stand in April, three months
after he had secured the documents from the bank — is
sittincr there and he has all of the papers and these

24
documents and exhibits right out of the banks are lodged
with the Clerk of this Court for your inspection.
QUESTION:

Is this agent

part of the United

States Government?
MR. RAMPEY:

Yes, sir, he is an Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Agent and —
QUESTION:

.And so is the United States Attorney

an agent of the United States Government, is he not?
MR. RAMPEY:

Yes, sir, but I don't think the

agent is necessarily — the United States Attorney might
request subpoenas on behalf of the party, i.e., the United
States of America, but my point is that there was no
return on these subpoenas to the court where they were
purported to be issued from.
The agent says, "Well, I filled in the informa­
tion and I still have the original subpoenas."
no notice

There was

to the defendant, no return to the court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rampey, would you say your

client's Fourth Amendment rights were violated if the
government lawyer had written a letter to the bank and said,
"Please turn over the following documents.

If you don't

turn them over voluntarily, we v.Till get out a Grand Jury
subpoena," and the bank had responded to this letter by
doing just what it did here?
MR. RAMSEY:

I think they still would have been.

25

Yes, sir, I do because I think a depositor has, even under
this Court's rulings and more recently, in the Supreme
Court of California, has ruled under their constitutional
provisions that a bank depositor has a reasonable
expectation of privacy under their equivalent of the Fourth
Amendment to the sanctity of those documents.
QUESTION:

Has he the right of action against the

government or the bank?
MR. RAMPEY:

There are some cases cited in my

brief, Mr. Justice, where a private right of action in
contract is available.
I think, though, that here the depositor does
have a constitutionally protected right of privacy under the
Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, the bank turned them over

voluntarily.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Well, your Honor —
Well, suppose the bank on its own

says, "I think that so-and-so is a violator of the lav: and
I have got some records and 7. am going to give them to the
U.S. Attorney," and hands them to him.

Is that a violation

of the Fourth Amendment?
MR. RAMPEY:

Not if he does it on his own

without any governmental —
QUESTION:

That is what I said.

26
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that's true.
That is not a violation of the

Fourth Amendment.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

That's true.

But there is no —

Well, now, what is the difference

between that and the way he does it pursuant to subpoena?
MR. RAMPEY:

Our point is this.

These subpoenas,

number one, were invalid as a process of a grant.
QUESTION:

Well, I am talking about standing now.

I'm not talking about the validity.

I am talking about

standing.
MR. RAMPEY:

Because if the government intervenes

to some extent in the procurement of these records and
documents in which we contend the depositor has a reasonable
expectation of privacy that is justifiable, then this
gives — this is the sarie situation as where, for example,
a secret service agent asks an airline employee to search
a piece of baggage and he does so.
QUESTION:

I think this Court —

Well, suppose the Alcohol, Tax and

Beverage — or whatever that guy is, goes to the man -- the
auditor and says, "I want to see this man's records"?
Would that be a violation of the Fourth Amendment?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:
MR. RAMPEY:

His accountant?
Yes.
But that is not —

27
QUESTION:

You have got a little trouble there,

don't you?
MR. RAMPEY:
is not the case here.
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I do, your Honor, but that
Humber one —
Do you think an accountant is less

obliqed to protect his secrecy than a bank?
MR. RAMPEY:

I think banks are more obliged to

protect the secrecy in this instance because, number one,
the records are compelled to be kept by banks under the
Bank Secrecy Act and number two, there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy as to these records and documents.
The banks really don't necessarily have to have
all of these copies of t.he checks and the documents.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he gives the aaent the

exact check and not a copy?
MR. RAMPEY:

The bank would have no right to do

that.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose it did.

What would

you do about it?
MR. RAMPEY:

The bank should be sued because they

That is

close to voluntary.
MR. RAMPEY:

for example, a landlord cannot go in on his own and allow
the law enforcement officers to go in and search in a

QUESTION:

Mr. Rampey.

MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Let's assume for the moment that the

records involved in this case had been those of a department
store that had extended credit to

your client.

Would you

have a different case?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

The records of a department store?
Ye;s.

Your client had been extended

credit by the department store.

It obviously had records

of the account, with your client.
Let's assume that the U.S. Attorney had issued
a subpoena to obtain those records.
MR. RAMPEY:

Mr. Justice, I think that would be

a different case.
QUESTION;

Why?

MR. RAMPEY:

Because, number one, that would

expose only his transactions with that department store.
The records that we are talking about today are records

case, are records that really tell more about the individual

and I think — even Donaldson, we contend that Donaldson
is distinguishable in this particular instance.
Number one, Donaldson was not a constitutional
case in the sense of this case.

It was a question of

whether or not the taxpayer had a right to intervene.
T7e would argue that the language in Donaldson is
basically from Rule 2482 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure,, I.e., whether or not he had a right to intervene
to protect an interest relating to property.
QUESTION:

Let me change and qive you another

variation of these hypothetical cases that have been put to
you.

As you know, some people who receive checks,

particularly businesses, make a microfilm of every check
they receive.
HR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And suppose

somewhere along the

line, one of the holders in due course of this man's check
had made microfilms.

Now, he is not a banker.

He is

simply a person who received that check in due course and
while he had it, of course, he had a property right in it.
You would agree, I am sure.
Now, could a subpoena reach that check in the
hands of that former holder in due course of the check?
MR. RAMPEY:

If he still retained the original,

yes, sir, I think so, but —

31
QUESTION:

No, the original goes back to the

issuer, doesn't it?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Oh, the microfilm, yes, sir.
No, no, the microfilm copy of that

check is in the hands of one of the holders in due course
and it may have been — he might have three or he might
have 30, conceivably.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now, is that -- the right of privacy

is the same, isn't it?
In this case, in my hypothetical.
MR. RAMPEY:

I would argue not.

No, sir, I

would argue not for the reason, as I a-'jain indicated, that
that exposes only one single transaction.
This case right here is a graphic example of
where you can get four months of a man's total financial
life unfolded before you

with what we contend are illegal

Grand Jury subpoenas.
QUESTION:

Well, frequently, the Government does

that when they are making a tax fraud case, do

they not,

a net worth case?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

They do.
Ary problem about getting that by a

subpoena?
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, our contention is, to the

32
subpoenas themselves, are that the subpoenas were improperly
used.
QUESTION:

Well, but that is a different point.

MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That is not the privacy point.

How do you

distinguish this — to pick up the

net worth tax case — how do you distinguish the right of
privacy here from the right of privacy that is involved when
the government is making a net worth tax-fraud case using
bank records and a

great many other types of records —

accountant's records?
MR. RAMPEY:

Our point is that the Grand Jury

subpoena as used in this manner to acquire these voluminous
records from banks invades the depositor's reasonable
expectation of privacy that is protected under the Fourth
/

S*

Amendment, of the United States of America and we rely on
Katz — the language in Katz and also as to the proprietary
interest in the documents themselves, we also cite Mancusi
versus DeForte, which is a case where the man did not have
any proprietary interest, in the union documents that were
secured in his shared office space and in this particular
instance, we have compulsory record-keeping of everyone's
financial documents and papers by all the banks

We have a situation graphically demonstrated here

where Grand Jury subpoenas can be utilized by Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents and ostensibly under the
supervision of the United States Attorney's Office in the
absence of a Grand Jury and in the absence of a return made
to the Court until the question is made.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rampey, are you saying in response

to the Chief Justice's question that assuming the subpoena
had been proper and a proper return had been made that these
bank records are simply immune from any sort of discovery?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I am not sayinq that.
Then what showing does the government

have to make in order to discover them?
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, the government — in this

instance, as the government concedes, they were looking for
possible transactions that —
QUESTION:
my question?

Okay, well, what is your answer to

What showing does the government have to make

if they are not absolutely immune?
MR. RAMPEY:

I think at this stage they should

have to make a probable cause showing to —
QUESTION:

Well, how does the government develop

probable cause except running down leads such as this?
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, they can develop — if they

can't develop probable cause, they should not intrude into
a constitutionally-protected area.

34
QUESTION:

Well, this would just wipe out any

successful prosecution of white collar crime, what you are
suggesting.
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, I think, your Honor,

Mr. Justice, that by the same token, approving what the
government has done in this case will allow them, in an
unsupervised manner, to go and look at anyone's records in
these banks at any time.
QUESTION:

But the government has been doing

that for years with subpoenas so it is you that is asking
for the change, not the government.
MR. RAMPEY:

But the essential difference also

is that we are contending today that these records should
be allowed the same dignity as the original records that
were at home, at the home of the defendant.

They could not

What if they were in the hands of

his accountant?

third party.
Of course, we would argue here that this is —

The case — the California Supreme Court

cases cited in my brief indicate that depositors themselves
have a right of privacy and contract and tort that they can
enforce in this regard but the —

You would have a little trouble there,

wouldn't you, under Walling v. Oklahoma Press -- under that?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

To some extent, but -Well, the point is, Walling said, the

point is that the Fourth Amendment is not inapplicable but
that the reasonable equivalent of probable cause is the
need of the Grand Jury or the Government to investigate
violations of the law.
MR. RAMPEY:

That is another point, too, that

it is really not the need of the Grand Jury.

I think it

is the need of —
QUESTION:

Well, you see, that is the traditional

function of the Grand Jury.

36

MR. RAMPEY:

Well, it is and I think even the

Department of Justice, in a statement to the House Judiciary
Committee on December the 5th, 1974, has indicated that the
traditional functions of independence of Grand Juries is
really a myth.

This is a letter at Congressional Record,

House, page 11355 and 356, written by Assistant Attorney
General Rakestraw and in response to pending legislation
regarding eliminating Grand Juries, he refers to the
independence of Grand Juries as really non-existent any
more as a practical matter.
They work under the auspices of the United States
Attorney * s Office.
QUESTION:

That is hardly responsive to my

question on Walling.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, your Honor.
Isn't it.

How would the bank respond

to a subpoena for its own records.
MR. RAMPEY:

In behalf of their depositors?

QUESTION:

No, in behalf of the bank.

QUESTION:

Perhaps the bank examiners.

MR. RAMPEY:

Yes, sir.

Well — but that — that

would be an investigation relating to the bank but not to
depositors.
QUESTION:

What if the records here were in the

possession of the taxpayer himself?

What if they subpoenaed

37

his own records?
MR. RAMPEY:

He could invoke his Fifth Amendment

rights.
QUESTION:

I am not talking about that.

I am

talking about his Fourth Amendment rights — a subpoena to
your client for his own records investigating his taxes.
MR. RAMPEY:

He could rely — he could start by

relying on the Boyd case, which held that the Fourth and
the Fifth Amendment runs together.
QUESTION:

Wall, do you think Walling and cases

like that continued that approach insofar as the subpoena
and the Fourth Amendment are concerned?
MR. RAMPEY:

Mr. Justice, I have to admit I am

not too familiar with the Walling case so I don't think I
could really respond to that.
QUESTION:

I am sorry.

Well, you are asking here to apply

the Fourth Amendment to the subpoena situation.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Not to invasions of some other

protective areas.
MR. RAMPEY;

Well, I am really asking to apply

the Fourth Amendment to the individual depositors' rights -—
QUESTION:

I know, but with respect to the

subpoena of certain documents of which you say they have
some privacy interest.

38

Now, surely, you wouldn't think the Fourth
Amendment would protect these documents in the hands of the
bank if it wouldn't protect them in the hands of the
depositor.
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, as I indicated, I don't

know that I can respond because I air. not familiar with the
Walling case.

I am sorry.

QUESTION:

But —

Isn't your real complaint against the

fact that the banks do microfilming of the checks?
MR. RAMPEY:
fold.

Mr. Justice, our complaint is two­

One, is the compulsory microfilming, working in

conjunction with the Grand Jury subpoena process.
If this honorable Court will recognize a right of
a constitutional Fourth Amendment right in these records,
then we contend that Grand Jury subpoenas and Grand Jury
process does nothing but give —
QUESTION:

Do you want us to say that,.while the

Conqress can compel them to microfilm, nobody can use them?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

No, sir, that —
Well, what good is the microfilm if

you can't, use it?
MR. RAMFEY:

Well, it may be perfectly all right

if these records are indeed not protected under the Fourth
Amendment, but our contention is, if they are protected
under the Fourth Amendment Grand Jury procedures, just

39

simply do not afford any protection to the individual
depositor.

It leaves in the hands of the agent and the

United States Attorney^ Office, as a practical matter, the
securing of these records, ostensibly for the Grand Jury
proceedings, which, even in this record it is not

shown

whether or not these materials were even handed over to the
Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rampey, do you disagree with the

Government's statement that these records were the property
of the bank rather than the property of your client?
MR. RAMPEY:

I think, Mr. Justice, that from a

pure title standpoint, the bank owns the microfilm but as a
practical matter, really, they are not looking for tangible
evidence, they are looking for the information on the micro
film.

We are seeking to protect the information on the

microfilm.

And the point here —
QUESTION:

You object to the search as well as

the seizure, in effect.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Sir?
You object to the search as well as

the taking possession of the records.

Yes, sir.
So you would object even if an agent

You would make precisely the same

40

argument.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, and, in fact —
That is why you made the same

argument on the letter example I gave you.
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

And, in fact, the California —
Would your argument not be the same

even if he asked for just one check instead of

for four

months of records?
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So the scope of the subpoena really

has nothing to do with your Fourth Amendment contention.
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, but — in this particular

case we contend that the scope was too broad because as a
practical matter they didn’t -- the government argues there
may be independent sources for their inquiry.

I don't think

the record demonstrates any independent knowledge or request
for a particular check.
In fact, in both instances — in one instance they
microfilmed everything and put it in a bag and in the other
instance they sit down at the machine with a young lady and
look at everything and not only just this defendant, they
look at everyone else — have to sort of look at everyone
else on the whole microfilm but as to the independent source
argument by the government, we contend it is not even
demonstrated by the record in this case — that it is

41
graphically demonstrated that the agents didn't know any­
thing about any particular transactions and —
QUESTION:
MR. RAMPEY:
QUESTION:

Mr. Rampey?
Yes, sir.
It is not entirely clear to me the

extent to which you rely on the Bank Records Act.

Would

you be here today if that Act were not on the books?
MR. RAMPEY:

I don't believe we would,

Mr. Justice, because the C&S Bank of Warner Robins used
limited microfilming procedures, for example, and in that
particular instance there would have been no records.
QUESTION:

But banks traditionally have had

ledger accounts —

Some, yes, sir.
Reflecting the accounts of their

MR. RAMPEY:

Yes, sir, they have to maintain

some records that they feel are necessary for their oper­
ation.
QUESTION:

But if this case had arisen before the

Bank Records Act, you think the subpoena would have been
all right?
MR. RAMPEY:

Well —

QUESTION:

Or such records as may then have

42

MR. RAMPEY:

Well, I certainly wouldn't want to

concede that the subpoena and the manner in which it was
handled would have been all right.
QUESTION:

Right.

Apart from that, assuming

that you had a valid subpoena, as you view it, such records
as the bank then had could have been subpoenaed without
violation of the Fourth Amendment.
MR. RAMPEY:

Well, Mr. Justice, I would have

probably relied again on the California courts' rulings
and not only in their case where that wa3 an instance where
the police officer requested just the statements, the
man's statements.

Ke didn't get any checks and they held

that under their constitutional provisions he had a right
to privacy that was protected and also they have held that
the compulsory financial statements required of public
officials violates an individual’s reasonable expectation
of privacy as to his financial affairs.
And I 'would note, in closing, that as we have
indicated in brief, there are state cases where the
depositors have enforced their contractual and tort right
to privacy as to the rights of depositors for unreasonable
disclosing of these* materials.
I would also cite a case that
brief.

I do not have in

It is a Third Circuit case, Zimmerman versus Wilson,

81 Federal Second 847 in the Third Circuit.

43

This case was somewhat modified at a later date
but if, indeed, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy
as to these records on the part of bank depositors, I
believe the language in this case where, in fact, they note,
as even in the old case of Entick versus Carrington, it
really is not the paper, it is the information on the paper
that is sought to be protected and we contend here that the
interaction, the compulsori' recording of all these records
under the Bank Secrecy Act with the interaction of these
subpoenas does indeed invade an area where depositors
reasonably and justifiably can and should be protected.
If one cannot keep Sis own financial affairs
out of the scrutiny of the government except with some type
of probable cause showing, we would at least argue that,
certainly, his right to privacy has been diminished in a
great extent and even our Constitution —

MR. RAT-IPEY:

Uh huh, that's when you read the Act.

MR. RAMPEY:

I thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rampey.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Wallace?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
MR. WALLACE:

Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

The reasonable expectation of privacy involved
under the Fourth Amendment is only an. expectation of privacy
in one's own person, effects, et cetera.

If there is to be

privacy protection afforded to third party records, that
is a matter

for legislative consideration.

It is not a

Fourth Amendment right.
We have pointed out on page 31 of our brief in
footnote 21, bills have been introduced in Congress on this
subject and have a^iso pointed out legislation that exists
with respect to telephone company records and the records
of credit reporting agencies where Congress has seen fit to
provide some legislative protection.

45
Now, here there is no allegation of improper
disclosure of any matters relating to the Respondent's
personal affairs.

The only allegation is that these were

exposed to the agents conducting a proper government
investigation and I do want to point out to the Court that
one of the rules of criminal procedure not cited in the
briefs. Rule VI(e), does contemplate that government
attorneys will see Grand Jury evidence in the performance
of their duties.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, one other question on

your standing argument, please.

Do you contend that the

test of standing is the same when you are asking whether
one can object to a subpoena as it is when one is asked to
make an objection to the admissibility of evidence on Fourth
Amendment grounds?
I am wondering if you are not confusing two
different kinds of standinggquestions in
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

your brief?

Well --

Do you understand what I am asking?

MR. WALLACE:

I think it would be different.

It

is the person subpoenaed who has standing to object to the
subpoena and —
QUESTION:

And so if a person has standing to

attack a subpoena, the question of ownership would not be
relevant, whereas, it might be relevant when he is talking

46

about to raise a Fourth Amendment objection.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think anyone who is unduly

burdened by the need to comply with a subpoena has standing
to complain about the subpoena.
QUESTION:

And no one else, is your position.

MR. WALLACE:

And no one else.

It is only the

one who has to comply with it because the subpoena is very
comparable to the letter that you were posing hypothetically.
It is merely a request to produce information and if the
person subpoenaed wants to object that it is too burdensome
for him to do so, that it violates his Fourth Amendment
rights or that the subpoena is defective in some way, he may
do so.

If ha doesn't raise an objection, it is tantamount

to voluntarily turning over the records in response to an
oral or written request that isn't —
had
QUESTION: If he/turned over the records you might
have quite a different question in the trial of a case when
the motion is to exclude evidence, as my brother Stevens
suggests.
MR. WALLACE:

It is a different question, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

It is a different question and a

different standard.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Your standing argument sounds as though

47
you are just saying, what I really mean is, there is no
violation of the Fourth Amendment here with respect to the
depositor.
MR. WALLA.CE:

Well, it is a different question

but the answer to the question has been that the Fourth
Amendment in the context of seeking to exclude evidence does
not protect jus tertii interests.
QUESTION:

It does not protect —

Well, let's just say — you are

saying —
MR. WALLACE:

someone from having evidence

used against him which was taken in violation of someone
else's Fourth Amendment rights.
It just happens here that there was no Fourth
Amendment violation anyway but the standing point is still
in the case.

The answer is the answer given in Kong Sun

when it was said that the evidence could be used against one
of the defendants, although not against the other one, whose
premises were violated, whose rights and his premises were
violated.

That is the answer to it.

It is a standing issue

as — well, it is obscured slightly in this case because it
is, in our view, fairly obvious that there was no Fourth
Amendment violation of anyone's rights here.
Thank you.
