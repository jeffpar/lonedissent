P R O CEEDINGS
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 74-848, Greer against Spooks
Mr, Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H, BORK, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR„ BORK;

Mr, Chief Justice,

may it please the

Court s
We’re here on writ of certiorari to the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit,

The Court held that the

petitioners, one of whom is the Commander of Fort Dix in New
Jersey, is required by the First Amendment to the Constitution
to permit political campaign speeches by■respondent, and the
distribution of literature in areas of Fort Dix that are open
to the civilian public,
A preliminary injunction was entered in this case,
requiring that, of the Commander, this Court refused a stay
by a vote of five to four, 1 believe, and now a permanent
injunction has been entered.
Respondents Spock and Hobson have been denied permis­
sion to hold a lolicital rally on the base under Fott Dix
Regulation 210-26, which I will describe in a moment.
And the other four respondents were barred from the
base for the unauthorized distribution of literature, under

4
Fort Dix Regulation 210-27,
The content of the particular literature is not. before
us, it’s not in -the record, not in issue.

Respondents were

barred because they refused to seek prior written approval.
X think it will facilitate discussion if I take up the
two issues separately.
of political speech and

And I would like to begin with th® issue
campaign rallies on a military base.

The regulation at issue is printed on page 6 of our
brief, it’s Fort Dix Regulation 210-26, paragraph 2a, and it
states simply that "Demonstrations, picketing, sit-ins, protest
marches, political speeches and similar activities are prohibited
and will not be conducted on tha Fort Dix Military Reservation.”
Now, the only part of that regulation that’s really
at issue her© is the part that applies to and prohibits political
speech

-*• political speeches.

Not political speech in the

informal sense, but a formal political speech.

^

Not/, respondents, 1 think, in their brief and in
their argument, and, indeed, I .think the Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit discussed ‘that regulation as if it were
subject to the same analysis as the ordinance of a city council
applying to civilians within

that city.

And X have no trouble

in agreeing -that if that wore the case, if this were not a
special context, indeed, the ordinance, such an ordinance would
be unconstitutional under the First Amendment.
But we’re dealing her® with a military base, devoted

5

to the training of soldiers, and it's never been held, I think,
or it*s never been suggested, I don’t believe -- that the
First Amendment converts a military base into a Hyd© Park for
the convenience of those who wish to make campaign speeches»
Tha fact that Fort Dix has, as it doss have, some
streets and pax’king lots, I don’t think makes it a wide open
forum for partisan political rallies.

And I should note here

that the difference from the civilian context is marked by the
fact. — and I think it’s ' undoubted -- that the Commander of
Fort Dix has the lawful power to exclude all civilians from the
base,
I take it that that’s true from Cafeteria Workers v.
McElroy, I take it that that’s true from 18 U„S„C» 1382, end,
indeed, I take that to b& true because I think it’s conceded
in this case,
QUESTIONz Well, it was true in Flower, too, wasn't it?
MR, BORKs

It’s true in Flower, also,

I think

Flower is a different case, in a variety of reasons I’m going
to coma to.

One, I think —* one reason, one point of difference,

it seems to me, is that that street was indistinguishable from
any other civilian street, indeed continued straight through
from the city? in a way that is not true at Fort Dix,
But

I think that there are other seasons that Flower

does not govern this case,
QUESTION:

If I recall correctly, Flower put emphasis

6

on the fact that this was a public street, in fact, going through
that base, —
MR. BORKs That's true.
QUESTIONS
MR. FORK:

-- as a part of the base.
That's true.

I think that street was

indistinguishable from any other public street, with shops and
civilians on it# and so forth.
QUESTIONs

It merely meant that the base there was

divided into two parts by a public highway that went through
some major portion.
MR. BORKs That is trise# and I think the Court said
there that the military had abandoned control over that street.
I think that definitely in Pott Disc that is not true.
QUESTION?

Well# but civilians can certainly com® on­

to Fort Dix without being stopped at a guard's gate or anything
like that.
MR. BORKs

They can.

The Commander# I think# retains

the lawful power to change that at any time.
QUESTION? Wall# but didn't. h@ retain that power in
Fort. Sam Houston in Flower# too?
MR. BORKs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist# if I thought that

Flower had announced a principle so broad as to say that if the
Commander lets civilians on -the base# then he must let them on
the base for all purposes? that is? 'that any access means all
access# then I would# without hesitation# ask this Court to

7
modify or overrule Flower»
I don't think it should be read that broadly»

One

reason, I think, is that this Court thought that street had been
abandoned, X don't think there's any abandonment here, for
reasons I"11 go into? secondly, ten days after Flower, in the
Lloyd Corporation v. Tanner case, this Court discussed the fact
that a shopping center, which allowed civilians or shoppers or
people to enter freely, nevertheless did not extend a full
invitation for all purposes»
Now, X would take it that if a shopping center is
capable of limiting the scop® of the invitation, so as to
exclude tie exercise of First Amendment leafletting, then,
a fortiori, a military base has at least the same powers.
QUESTION: Well, can't you argue
•though,

just the opposite,

that since the shopping center is, in many respects,

private, it may b© able to limit an invitation in a way that
the government, which is not private in any respect, can't?
MR. BORK:

If, Your Honor, you're referring to the

State action difference, I don't think ~~ I think there may be
that difference.

On the other hand, in Logan Valley Flaaa

State action was seen, and in that section of Lloyd Corporation
v. Tanner, which discusses the ability of the shopping center
to extend an invitation which is limited in scop®, they are not.
dealing with the State action problem.

So that I think that

aspect of that opinion is fully applicable here.

8

But, in any event, X take it as a premise that it.5 s
undented that the Commander of the base could exclude all
civilians,

X take it, also, as a premise that some deference

is due to the judgment of the military commander; indeed, that
deference is expressed in 18 U.S.C. 1382, as to what activities
harm the function of the military.
The fact that there are open spaces here and streets,
I think in no way conforms this casei to cases involving the
civilian context, as Hague v, 0,1.0, speaks of the streets from
time immemorial being used as places for discussion in the;
exchange of political ideas,

And it’s that tradition, that use,

that makes them a public forum in some sense,
Xn Lehman v. Shaker Heights, this Court quoted the
words of Lord Dunedin, who said -» and I think it's perfectly
applicable her® -«• “the truth is that open spaces and public
places differ very much in their character, and before you could
say whether a certain thing could be done in a certain place
you would have to know the history of the particular place,w
The history of military bases in this country has been
uniform.

Campaign speeches have not been given on thorn. That

has bean something that has never been allowed.

So far es I

know, Dr. Spock is the first candidate for a national public
office, ©r indeed for any public office, who has attempted to
give a political speech on a base,
QUESTIONt What about- say, a charter amendment in a

9
city or some initiative or referendum matter?
MR. BORIC?
QUESTION t
MR. BOKK:

I — the —

A speech in support or in opposition to
You mean as opposed to a candidate?

An

issue speech.
Mr. Justice White, the regulation at Fort Dix, I take
it, would cover -that, because it would be a political speech,
I take it.

I'm not sure that they mean partisan political

speech by that.

1 think they might mean issue political speech

as well.
But that, of course, is not what's before us, in this
particular case.
QUESTION;

But you ara positing

but you are

justifying the regulation on the grounds that particular kinds
of speech just don't fit in the military?
MR. BORKs

Yes.

QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

MR. BORKs

Yes, I am.

And I would have thought that that was clear from the
tradition of this country, and that the law was clear to that
effect.

And, indeed, it seems to me there are only really two

arguments advanced by -the Court of Appeals and by the respondents
against it.
QUESTION::

But you would, I suppose — but you're

saying the regulations prohibit all political speech, it's just

10

not some?
MR, DORK: That is true,
QUESTIONS And you wouldn't be here, X suppose, if it
just prohibited some kinds of political speech?
MR, BORKs

If it were discriminatory, you mean,

Mr. Justic® White?
QUESTIONS

Yes,

ME, BORKs

No, I would not ba here.

This is a non-

discriminatory regulation, designed for very good purposes,
QUESTIONs

You'd let that case be argued by the

general counsel of the Array, then?
MR, BGRK:

I would authorise -- I might, at the

outside, authorise the filing of a brief, Mr, Justice
Rehnquist,
But the Court of Appeals' argument rests upon two
propositions, both of which I think are demonstrably false.
The first is, and I quote, "if the reservation is
open to all the rest of the public, there is no basis for
holding that it may be closed selectively to political candi­
dates or to distributors of unapproved literature,"
Now, since .it's conceded that ‘the base commander could
seal the base to all civilians, that argument merely asserts
that if tlae Commander allows any access by civilians, he is
constitutionally required to allow all access.
QUESTION; Well, wouldn't you concede that if he does

11
in certain areas of the base allow access to the public, he has
to allow access to every member of the public who isn’t
misbehaving or showing some ~
MR, BORKs

Well, I think he has to allow access to

QUESTIONi

I mean, he has to allow access to Dr»

every

Speck»
MR. BORK:

Allow access to — Dr. Spock has complete

access to the base, any base, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I’m talking

about Dr. Spock for the purpose of making a political campaign
speech *—
QUESTION s

But the way you put it was not quite the

way you intendejd it, perhaps.
MR. BORKs Access for all purposes, perhaps, would be
better.

If he allows access for any purposes, the Court seems

to be saying h@ must allow access for all purposes.
QUESTIONS

Yes, that’s a different -~

MR. BORKs

Now, that proposition, I think, if it were

true, would force every Commander to choose between sealing hi3
base tight or allowing it to become Hyde Park, a forum for
political discussion.
Ami, indeed, if that proposition were true, I take
it this Court would face much the same choice, because this
Court has limited access, political banners and campaign
speeches may not. be made in this building or on these premises.

12
although access is allowed to the public»

So I take it that if

that proposition were generally true, this Court would be put
to the same choice of excluding the public or allowing political
speech whan it didn’t interfere with a particular session of
the Court»
Any of those choices would be quite wrong, and they
would be quite wrong, I think, for reasons that parallel the
reasons cf forcing such a choice upon the military would be
quit® wrong»
And, as I’ve mentioned, also, the Court of Appeals'
proposition, that access for any purpose is access for all
purposes, seems to me, also, to be contradicated by the later
opinion in Lloyd Corporation v\, Tanner»
It is a simple non sequitur, and I think there must
be come other policy reasons one would have to search for»
Now, the only other argument worth mentioning, made
by tlie Court of Appeals, is that a wide range of newspapers and
magazines are permitted on the base, and the troops are allowed
to listen to radio and television without restriction in their
off-duty hours.

And the Court notes that sometimes minor-party

candidates don’t get as much media coverage, and they don't have
as much money to buy media coverage as more popular or betterknown candidates do, and therefore must make do with face-toface campaigning»
Now, the Court concludes from that that the minor-

13

party candidate is harmed because he needs t.o get on the base
to have face-to-face campaigning„ although there’s the rest of
the nation to engage in it, whereas major-party candidates are
reported in the New York Times or any of 'the magazines or on
television»

And the Court concludes this remarkable analysis

by referring to the Fort Dix policy, thereforee as, quote, C5a
feigned neutrality that serves no discernible military purpose”.
And I would like to raise several objections to that,
although there are more than several that could be made.

And,

in the first placa* I would like to raise the objection, or
like to point out that the statement that there is no discernible
military policy is simply wrong.

In fact, there is a crucial

military policy, and that policy is the traditional safeguard
in this nation of the separation of the military establishment
from our politi.cal processes.
It’s not a question of will these people passing out.
leaflets or making speeches interfere with the training
exercise, of course that can be prevented. And it’s not a
question of will political opinion reach the soldiers, they
reach it all kinds of ways.

Soldiers are citizens and they get

opinions through the media, from each other, from civilians
outside, in a variety of ways.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Solicitor, I have a problem, a little

problem, with just one point.
and that’s okay?

You could mail these leaflets,

14
MR» BQRK:
QUESTIONS
against that.

That is true.

Well, if the leaflets —■

If they were mailed, there's no restriction

If they were mailed to each soldier on the base.

MR. BORKs There's no restriction in the sense that the
mail isn't covered.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. BORKs But I think# Mr. Justice Marshall# —
QUESTION: But you can't hand them out.

Now# —«

MR. BORKs Well# you can hand them out if you get
prior approval, and prior approval, the regulation, says# will
be granted.
QUESTION;: BTjfe yon don't gat prior approval of the
mailing.
MR. BORKs

Well# no# but that’s-# it seems to me# not

a good objection to this policy# to say that the military hasn't
expanded the policy to cover censorship of the mails.

The

military has been quite reasonable about these policies# and
it has not attempted to censor or cut things out.

It has tried

to impose minimal regulations.
QUESTION z Well# if they do# I imagine -that would foe
litigated# too.
MR, BOKK:

I imagine it might be# Mr, Justice Marshall,

But I think the fact that they have not tried to
censor the mails is not a reason to object to their attempts
to make sure that leaflets are not distributed# which pose a

15
clear danger, as they say, to discipline, morals, and —
QUESTION; Well, do you think

could the base forbid

soldiers stationed there from attending political meetings off
base?
MRo BORKs

NOo

They do not, Mr® Justice White»

QUESTION % Well, could they?
MR» BORKs

Could they?

I do not believe so»

They do

have a regulation that says if they attend political ~ partisan
political meetings off base, they shouldn't ~~ they must not
attend in uniform»
QUESTIONS That’s right,
MR,, BORK: Which points out the clear symbolic line
that tli® military is trying to draw between military activity
and political activity,
QUESTION? So it isn’t that —«it’s the way -•» their
worry is iow the military would look to the public, rather than
any danger to the soldier?
MR, BORKs

Oh, no, I think not,

I think not,

I

think -the American soldier <—
QUESTIONs Well, they’re going to let him go off th©
base and attend any political meeting he wants to attend,
MR» BORKs

That’s right.

That’s quit© true, Mr,

Justice White, and this is not an attempt to prevent him from
hearing any ideas,
QUESTIONS And they let him listen to the radio all he

16

wants to or read all the magazines and —
MRo EORKs

I must say, the fact that the military'

allows all of these things ~QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. BORKs

— and is so wide open, it seems to me not

an argument against that narrow —
QUESTION % Well, what is the reason, then, for the
regulation?
MR» BORKs Well, I think it’s simply -this:

It has

always bean understood that there is this separation between the
military and the political process*

It’s understood that you

are also a citizen* But when you com© on the base, at that
point you leave organized, partisan political activity behind
you, it's not part of your military life*

And I think that is

largely a symbolic difference, but it’s a crucial symbolic
difference.

It separates it in the minds of the soldier.

He

knows when he*s in his unit he’s not a political animal*
He may have an opinion, but right now he5s being a military man,
That has been a tradition in American politics and
in American military life throughout most of the history of
this Republic, and I think it's a crucial tradition.

It's

crucial for two reasons, crucial in two aspects*
QUESTION:

Yes, but whilp they are sitting fchei" on

the base, and they listen to

they're free to listen to

political speeches on the radio’, or on television —

17
MRo BORK t Th a.t - it sesms to me, ~~
QUESTIONS

— they are free to sit around in their

uniform and read the magazines, read the speeches.
MR- BORKs That is true. That is true.

I think we ar©

dealing, as we must in this area, with differences of degree
which, at some point, become so large that they become
differences in kind.

And it seems to me that the soldier

listening to the radio, reading a speech, talking in the
barracks, going to a rally elsewhere -*» well, ©liminare the
last.

The first three examples is reached as an individual,

and that is quit© a different thing from rallying soldiers on
a base, where they perceive themselves as soldiers, and
subjecting them to political exhortation, that, I think,
encourages a blurring of the distinction between the military
and the civilian — and the regular political process. And
that.*s a distinction I think we would be in very bad shape if
we blurred.
And, of course, it requires drawing lines. The
military here has drawn the line as far back as they can and
allowed as much as they can, which I think ought not to be
turned against them.

I think it’s commendable that they have

drawn the line and the regulation as narrowly as they have.
If we once blur this distinction, so that troops are
subjected to political speeches on base, gathered in crowds on
base, we then begin to teach

them 'that political ideas

18
properly mix with military enclaves- military functions.
That, it seems to me, is a very bad idea.

It may affect

ultimately their performance of their military duties, it may
affect their attitude toward their superiors or towards their
juniors.
There will be times in this country again- I’m sure,
of enormous unrest and great dissent, ef civil disobedience.
One thing we ought to preserve is the idea that the military
doesn91 take part in that as military.

So that we don’t get

military disobedience in the name of political ideas.
The other thing about that that on® ought to mention
*“« we live in quiet times now, but if political speeches and
campaign rallies can be held on -the base by civilians, I don’t
see how troops can be kept from holding their own political
rallies and campaign speeches on a base. There may be times
and conditions in this country in which there will be a military
viewpoint, or at least you encourage the formation of a military
viewpoint, if you allow that kind of thing.

And I think'that

would be very bad for American politics, if fell ere were a mili­
tary political viewpoint.
What this regulation is designed to implement,
narrowly and carefully, is a tradition that prevents a
politicised military and a tradition that prevents militarized
politics.
And that’s what I think is at stake here.

19

And 1 think the fact that so many other sources of
information are open to the troops is not a. reason to question
this policy.
Now* the statement that the neutrality is feigned*
I think — I mean* I hope I have shown that there is a dis­
cernible* indeed a crucial* military policy that is served by
these regulations .
But I should like to address
QUESTIONS

You’ve been addressing yourself up to

now primarily to Regulation 210-26 2a* haven’t yon?
MR. BORKt

I had been* Mr, Justice Stewart* but I

got drawn into this «—
QUESTIONs
MR. BORKs
QUESTIONS

I know you did,
to the leaf letting as well.
I know you did* but it. was your purpose

to separate the two and discuss them separately.
MR. BORK z At the outset* that was my purpose.
QUESTION I

Yes.

MR. BORK: And I have been addressing this* although I
think the leafletting regulation is close to it.
But I wanted to say on® other 'thing about this
statement that 'this is a feigned neutrality.
It is a real neutrality* and if there is a disadvantage
in getting madia, proportional media coverage by these candi­
dates* financially disadvantaged candidatas have n© greater

20
First Amendment rights than other candidates.
The Constitution does not require the Commander at
Fort Dix to make his troops available, as compensation for a
candidate’s inability to buy ads or to attract the Mew York
Times or the attention of NBC.
If, indeed, that were the Constitution, which the
Third Circuit appears to think it is, I would suppose it would
be true that if the Commander could close his base to all
civilians except minor-party candidates — because ha!d be
required to use his base as a reservoir to compensate dis­
advantaged candidates.
Now, there axe more objections to it, but I trust
that. I have shown at least that the policy is real, and that
the neutrality is not feigned, but real.
Now, the leafletting regulation is really here on its
face, in affect, because we have no example of the leaflets,
they are not in evidence because they weren’t submitted for
approval.

But I should say that the way this operates is the

leaflets are — or any matter that would be passed out, is
presented to the Base Commander,

He is directed by the regula­

tions that he is to allow distribution, unless he makes a
finding — unless he makes a finding — supported by evidence
that he can state that there would be a clear danger to moral®
and discipline on his base.
QUESTIONS

Have there in fact been instances v?here

21
h© has done that, Mr» Solicitor General?

Where ho has made

those findings?
MR» BORKs
but

I believe so at Port Dix»

I believe so,

if 13m wrong, I’ll correct myself later»
If he makes such a finding, he must forward it, by

telephonic communication, to a higher echelon, indeed to Army
Headquarters, so that they can decide and impose a uniform
national policy on this»
doing aberrational things»

So that we don’t have base commanders
And he is specifically instructed

that whether he likes the literature or not has nothing to do
with it, he is specifically instructed that it doesn’t matter
if the literature is critical of U» S, policies or officials,
and it dcssn’t matter even if it's unfairly critical»
All h® may judg® is whether it poses a clear danger
to idle discipline and good order and morale of the troops»
QUESTION^

Mr» Solicitor General, maybe it takes us

out of order back to the historical aspect, but isn’t there
some history fchax during the Civil War commanders who favored
Lincoln gave special treatment to campaigners who cam® on the
bases and out into Array camps, even in the field, at the time
they were setting up arrangements for the balloting of soldiers?
MR» BORKs:

Indeed there have been violations of this

tradition throughout history, and I think those were examples
of it, Mr» Chief Justice»
However, to say that a tradition has been violated,

22
I don't think means that it is not impox’tant, not crucial, and
not worth trying to preserve,,

Indeed, Congress, in a number of

statutes, I think, cited at page 26 of our *»•» well, it's not 26,
but cited in our brief -«* has attempted to — page 36 of our
brief*

list some statutes in which Congress has tried to

shore*»up this tradition*

And it may be precisely because of

knowledge that in the past some violations and breaches

of

that tradition have occurred.
I was — ray attention was called just yesterday to a
letter by President Lincoln to General Hooker, when he appointed
him in his command, in which h® said: wI*m appointing you,
there ar® some things about you I like and some things about
you I don't like," he said., "but you do keep" — it was a very
straightforward President, and he said, “but you do keep your
military duties and politics separate; and that I like,”
So X think that this has been a tradition and a safe­
guard that w® have tried to insist upon, that has been violated
from time to time, but X think that is only all the more reason
to try to insist upon it. now and to continue to insist upon it*
I should like to reserve the remainder of my tiro®*

as in Flower»

And it seems to m® that it is indistinguishable

from a city street,
QUESTIONs Well, it wouldn’t satisfy you, though, if
your client were permitted, to make a speech out in the street,
subject to all the traffic hasards -that would be involved?
MR, KAIRYSa

Oh, no, I4m referring to the sidewalk

on that street,
QUESTIONs

On this picture, which side is the base

and which side is Vf rights town?
MR, KAIRYSs The photographer is on the base,
QUESTIONS And so -MR, KAIRYSs

And Wrightstown is in beyond — do you

see the railroad crossing?

The crossed white fane© at the top

of a post?
QUESTIONS

Oh, yes,

MR, KAIRYSs Where the railroad comes,
QUESTION t

Yes,

MR, KAIRYS? Right next to that there is two small
mounds, this is in the testimony regarding this picture, there’s
two small mounds on either side of the street that indicate
that you are entering the base.
QUESTIONS

So the near left side is the base?

25
MRKAXRYSs

The whole

the street where that

railroad crossing is, beyond that railroad crossing is Wrightstown, New Jersey, in the background of the picture.
QUESTION?

Y@s.

MR. KAXRYSs Towards the photographer, closer to the
picture is the base.

Prom then — and then --

QUESTIONs Where’s the "Cleaner & Laundry", on the
base or —
MR. KAIRYSs

That's in Wrightstown.

QUESTION? And what about the one on -the left side,
also a cleaner and a laundry?
There are two cleaners and laundry there.
MR. KAIRYSs• The two cleaners are in Wrightstown.
They are just before the entry to the base.

It’s really a

matter, as the Court of Appeals said, of about five feet from
the commercial district of Wrightstown to the beginning of the
base.
QUESTIONs

And that, bar just beyond the cleaners and

laundry, that's also Wrightstown?
MR. KAXRYS:

That’s all Wrightstown, yes, sir.

The two civilians on the has®, on this side, the photographer’s
side of th® railroad crossing, are Respondents Ginaven and Misch

This was taken actually just prior to their actual

QUESTION s

I suppose, Mr. Kairys, ther® is on®

distinction between Flower and this case, that one was not
plenary argument, it was a summary disposal, wasn't it?
MR. KAIRYSs

Oh, yes, procedurally.

Yes.

Ar© you referring to some distinction between the
particular area of the base involved there and the one here?
QUESTION?.

No»

You just said there wasn’t any

difference between the Flower case and this one, and ~
MRo KAIRYS;
QUESTIONs

I’m sorry —
■*»*- I'm merely saying that if there was

that distinction here —
MR. KAIRYS;

Yes, sir.

I was limiting myself.

I’m sorry, 1 should have been clear.

I was limiting myself to

the description of the actual areas involved, that -they are the
same.
And I don’t think it’s fair to say that the base was
abandoned in any kind of sens© of abandoning control, as the
Solicitor General says, in Flower.
t

It's evident from the fact, that Flower was arrested
there twice by military authorities, that indeed the military
exercised control over that area.
QUESTION?

That automobile that's turning right [sic]

onto —» is that •—> is the highway at that point
MR. KAIRYS;
QUESTIONS

That is a civilian vehicle —
Is that on *the base or is that a State

27
highv fty?
MR, KAIRYSs That's on the bass, but it8s a State
road that goes right 'through the base»
QUESTIONs Well, that's my question,
MRo KAIRYSs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
In other words, there are State roads that

go through the base which ar© not under the control of the
military, is that right?
MR, KAIRYS:

Absolutely.

The State retained easements

over those roads when the land was ceded to the military.
QUESTIONS

Well, as I remember it, I’ve been over this

base manj times, and there are countless streets like that,
aren’t there?
MR. KAIRYSs

There are.

The —* Colonel Olsen, the

Provost Marshal, testified that there were ten such entrances
similar to this, that ar® wholly open to the public? merely
marked that you're entering the bas®.
As a matter of fact, on Exhibit E-4, that’s taken on
New Jersey Rout® 68, which is another State road that goes
entirely across the bass, and it marks the base, as it does at
the other one, and there's a sign on the gat® there that says
"Visitors Welcome"o
QUESTION;

Who has jurisdiction of the roads there

for traffic violations?
MR. KAIRYSs

They are patrolled by the military.

28

QUESTIONs

So the military hasn’t released -them

entirely„
MR, KAIRYSs
QUESTION s

No.
What if you want to hold a pared© on one

of those State streets, State roads, whom do you ask for
permission?
MR. KAIRYS2

Ones within the base, you mean?

QUESTION? Well, it’s a State highway, though.
MR, KAIRYSs
QUESTION?

Yes, —
On Rout® 68, where it goes through the

base.
MR. KAIRYS 5

You would hav® to ask the military

authorities.
QUESTION 2

Yea.

QUESTION? Why is that?
MR, KAIRYSs

The only thing that the State has is an

easement across the base.
QUESTIONs

Well, what if it wants to us© its easement

for a parade?
MR, KAIRYS? Well, I don't know if it’s ever happened,
but the military proclaims its control over those roads
entirely.
And it dees close them — for instance, if there’s a
demonstration ©r other activity at McGuire Air Force Base,
which is down the road, the military will entirely close the

29

civilian use of Route 68.
*

QUESTION?

So whatever property right the State has^

it's subject to military requirements»
MR» KAIRYS:
QUESTION?

That’s correct»
If the military wants — if the military

said; "We * re so busy ©n this has© ws’re going to have to use
this State highway from now on, exclusively for our own purposes"?
MR» KAIRYS * Then the State seems to accede to that.
QUESTIONt
MR» KAIRYSa

Mr» K&irys, who maintains the roads?
As I understand it, the military does.

QUESTIONS Do the State Police have any jurisdiction
©n any of these* roads or streets?
MR» KAIRYS3

I don't baliev® so.

I think their

jurisdiction ©nda right at the beginning of th© base on any of
the roads.
QUESTION g So they are maintained and policed by the
military?
MR. KAIRYS:

That’s correct.

They’re definitely

patrolled by the military; and any traffic violations are
processed by the military.

QUESTION? Do you know whether the highway right-of-way

reaches beyond property lines?

Are the sidewalks on par-5* of

the right-of-way or not?
MR» KAIRYSs

I don’t know»

But the military ©rercises

effective control over the sidewalks.
QUESTION*

Well, I understand that, just likely, but

QUESTIONS

I'm not sure I got your response clear on

the parade matter that Justice White was inquiring about.
If Dr, Spock wanted to run a parade down there, with
torch lights and the usual political parade, is it your view
that tee military commander could not refuse such a parade
permit?
MR, KAXRYS s

Well, it seems to me that. -*- first of

all, parades were not included, nor demonstrations in this
particular case.

But they ar® a protected form of sp©@ch.

It seems to ms teat that would have to undergo the
same kind of analysis that we have urged the Court to take in
this case, and that, is that we'd have to look at the government
interest involved, under the test that this Court has
prescribed over and over again, and see if that's an important
or substantial interest, to see if it's unreleated to suppression
of speech, and if the restrictions of speech ar® no greater
than are essential to furtherance of that interest.
And if not, then the First Amendment rights should be
allowed, I believe

32

1 think that's what the Solicitor General fails to do
in this ease, at all, is to subject this base to that kind of
analysis.

Rather than go through the analysis anti point to

some specific military interest# any kind of concrete interest#
what the government has don®# essentially# is to create a kind
of false dichotomy that has sort of an emotional appeal.
They say it's a question of a military base# rather than streets#
sidewalks and parks.
Well# these are streets# sidewalks and parks.
they are open to th© public.

People can go on there for any

reason they pleas®# or for no reason at all.
on that.

And

There’s no limit

That’s »**
QUESTIONS

Do you agree that 'the Commander of th®

base could ©seclude thorn all for all purposes?
MR. KAIRYSs

I do.

Certainly.

But I think implicit in th© difference# say# between
tli© decision in Hague v. CIO# and th© decision in Davis v,
Massachusetts# is that that power to exclude all doesn't
necessarily include the lessor power to excludo soma# or to
exclude based on content,

I mean# that's essentially# it seams

to me# what the Solicitor General is saying# that we go back to
Day is v. Mass achus atts# where the only question is property
rights# and if you h&v© —- sine® you have the right to totally
exclude someone from your property# you also hav© the lesser
right to partially exclude# to selectively exclude# or to

I

33

exclude certain purposes »
It seems to me that that was overruled in Hague

,

and;,

sine© then, one© something is open to the public, people are
allowed to com© on and talk for any reason,,

The Provost Marshal

testified that the sight of a civilian talking to a few
soldiers in front of the PX or in front of th© cafeteria was
so common that it wouldn*t even b© noticed»
There5 s no question of them going up and checking and
asking what that person is saying at all»
QUESTIONa

What about coming on the base for the

purpose cf making a spaach that attacks military policy and is
aimed at urging soldiers not to fight in a particular battle or
a' particular war?
MR„ KAIRYSs

Well, you're talking about whether that

could, b© punished afterwards^
QUESTIONs

No, I*ra talking about whether’, if that's

th© kind »*■> whether that's the kind of a speech that the
Commander could exclude from the base,
MR., KAIRYSt

I think he — well, I don't think, under

th® guise of that danger, h@ could exclude all speeches»

And

that's really th© question here,
QUESTIONs

Well, that isn't what I asked you,

I

asked you whether h@ could exclude that on©»
MR» KAIRYSs

Y@s„

QUESTION; Well, th® United States' position is that

34

you ought also to be able to exclude political speech generally,
because political speech is inconsistent »« that, kind of
political activity is inconsistent with' the military posture,
MR, KAIRYS t But they offered no evidence or argument
about these particular speakers, the content of what they’re
going to say or the form,
QUESTIONS

No, they don’t.

They say — but they just

say political speeches generally,
MR, KAIRYSs Well, than that gets to the neutrality
point, which I think is a separate point,

I think what they're

saying is that the only kind of favoritism that makes any
difference to the Solicitor General is favoritism as to who
speaks person-to™person,

That one form of speech. They want

to el lain at© favoritism as. to one form of speech.

It seams

to me that that's not really the relevant concern.
Whan you have partisan —
QUESTIONt
MR, KAIRYSs
QUESTIONS

That's neutral as to people.
Pardon me?
That's neutral as to people —

MR. KAIRYSs As to that on® form of speech, they are
neutral.
They are wrong when they say Dr, Spook is the first one
that, gave a political speech.

The first ©no was former Vice

President Agnew, who gave a speech at Quonset Naval Base in
Rhode laland.

Permission to give that speech was granted three

35
days after they had made an argument, the military had made an
argument based on neutrality —* the exact argument that they
snake her© —■ in which they opposed, in court, "they mad® this
argument opposing also Dr. Spock and the same respondents in
this case, who sought access to that same base.
QUESTION s

The speaker in the case you gave was the

incumbent Vic® President, wasn't he?
MRa KAIRYS 5

That‘s correct»

And he gave a

political

speech —
QUESTIONS

And on® remembers a great many occasions

when an incumbent President spoke only at — almost only at
military bases, for the last year or so of his
MR» KAIRYSs
QUESTION:

incumbency»

Yes»
He is Commander-in-chief, and I suppose

he could changes any regulations that might be made at Fort Dix
or anywhere else, couldn’t h®?
MR» KAIRYSs

That’s correct.

I think tills sort of neutrality that obviously
doesn't really mean much to the Department of Defense if,
three days after they argue at court, they could grant parmission for a political candidat® to make a political speech, it
obviously doesn’t mean any tiling to ‘them.
QUESTIONs Well, but those are two different arguments»
On© is to say that the position really hasn’t bean maintained
at all, and it’s just kind of a screen, that -the Defense Depart-

36

ment really doesn’t follow -this position of n@utral.ityo

But

it's quite another thing to say that the position, even if
maintained, is not a legitimate or compelling government
interest which would justify what the Army tried to do here.
MR» KAIRYS3 We're saying both,

I!ra saying, even putting

aside what they did at Quonset Naval Base, that they are trying
to maintain a kind of neutrality around on® form ©f speech»
They’re saying that as t© face-to-face speech we're going to
be totally neutral.
How, of course, lt*s a pretty expensive brand of
neutrality, because it me tin 3 that the only candidates who can
get information to th® 1 voters »« and there’s 22,000 voters at
Fort Dix «*• th© only candi.dat.es who could do that are th® ones
that can afford to hire the mass media to get their message
across.
QUESTION* Could you help me with on© point.

This

isn't a general Array Regulation, this is a Regulation of Fort
Dix you're talking about, isn't it?
MR. KAIRYS:

/

/

That's correct.

QUESTIONi So where does Quonset come,- into this?
MR, KAIRYSz

I was just responding to th© statement

made by th© Solicitor General that Dr. Spoek was th© first
candidate ever to do a campaign speech on a base.

That’s all.

/

QUESTION:
with this case?

That doesn't *— what does that have to do

3?

MR. KAIRYSs
correct.

lt*s just that factually it wasn’t

Former Vico President Agnew had been the first on©.
QUESTIONi

It’s not important# the fact it wasn’t

correct.
MR. KAIRYS:
QUESTION«

Okay.
Mr. Kairys# before you go on* did 1 under­

stand you to say that the base* as you view it# properly could
exclude a speaker who advocated pure pacificism, no fighting#
no wars? .
MR. KAIRYS: Well# certainly if it gets to the point
of urging insubordination# failure to follow orders? y@s.

I think that would also -« that could involve
protected speech# and the circumstances of any such case# all
of the circumstances # would have to be included in the same
analysis.
QUESTION:

Suppose you had a candidate for President

who was running ©n a platform of peace under any and all cir­
cumstances, nevery fight* never resist* total pacificism, but
he was a candidate for President? how would you analyze that?
MR. KAIRYS:

Well# I would apply, myself# a clear and

present danger standard to statements like that by a civilian#
certainly by e civilian candidate for President.

And if there

were no clear and present danger of unlawful activities or of
violence# or something like that* 'then I would say it’s
protected

38

QUESTIONg

Suppos® »« let m® pursue the hypothetical

that Justice White was giving you — suppose we had soma city
in the country that had problems, such as we had in Littles Rock
about twenty years ago, and 104st Airborne Division was ordered
to stand ready to fly out fee that city and see that the federal
law waa enforced,

And so a Senator from that State asks the

base commander for permission to com® on the base and explain
to the soldiers why they shouldn't have any part ©£ it, or to
explain anything that he wants to explain? do you think the
Commander has got to allow that Senator to come on the bass?
MR. KAIRYSs Well, if h© gets to the point of urging
disobedience to orders, then I think it’s n© longer protected.
QUESTION;;

Well, let*® say that the Senator simply

say® he wants to com© on the base and discuss th® problem.

You

don't knew what'he's going to say until after he gets there.
MR. KhXRYSs

Well, I think soldiers, like other

citizens, should have all First Amendment rights that they can,
that ar® not inconsistent with their status of soldier.
This Court has said that as to prisoners. And that if ther© is
& political controversy going on in the country or in a
particular area about an issue, that people should be able to
talk to them and that they should b© able to receive that
information.
QUESTION

are you receding from your suggestion

that if this sows seeds of disobedience, that it could be pr©«

39

eluded?
MR. KAlRYSs

I’m saying if — if you urge insubordin­

ation t 1 could se© situations where if you urge violation of
orders, that that could ««* that that's no longer protected.
QUESTIONs

What do you do# stop the Senator in the

middle of his speech?
MR. KAIRYSj

Yes# that's — I thought the tradition

and the history# if they mean, anything# is that that is what
you do; that you don't impose a prior restraint on speech.
QUESTION s Well# isn't it a prior restraint if you
stop him in the middle?

It's prior restraint as to the

second half —»
MR. KAIRYSs

Well# I thought you meant by the

middle — I thought you mean by the middle# h@ was already
doing it.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

Already doing it.

MR. KAIRYSs Well# at the point he already does it#
then you stop him.
QUESTION?

1 see.

You don't think that's prior

restraint?
MR. KAIRYSs

No.

If ha's already committed a crime#

no.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Kairys# I think you said earlier that
*

the Commender could close the base to all citizens?
MR. KAIRYSs

Yes

40

QUESTION:

Well# suppose he war® to say:

sCommencing

October the 1st, 1976, through November the 7th, 1976,, th© base

MRa KAIRYSs

Well, effectively banning th© time when

any candidate could come ©n.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh, it being the Presidential

Election time.
MR. KAIRYSs

I would subject that to the same analysis,

if there's no substantial —
QUESTIONs

Now, this is a bar t© any civilian, for

any purpc.se, coming ©n the base.
MR. KAIRYSs

I understand.

Well, if there's no substantial concrete military
interest in this, unrelated to suppression of'freedom of
expression, which — and I think this would have a presumption
that it's related to — to me? it would ~~ that it's related to
suppression of expression, then, if there is no such interest,
then it wouldn't ba valid.
I would subject it to Hi© repeated analysis that this
Court has handed down.
I think it's important, in considering all the claims
of th.® military in this case, -that they have not really pointed

to any specific interest, arid it's pretty ©vident from one
quote, a very brief quote from their brief, that I would just
like to read.

This is at page 39.

41
”We do not in any way deprecate the vain® of freedom
of speech by observing that certain candidates might express
views ’that could undermine the morale, obedience and disciplina
of members of the military»w
There's an awful lot of "mights''1 and "coulds", and
the whole thing is framed as an observation.
QUESTION? What about the argument that I understood
the Solicitor General to make

you can agree with it or

disagree with its but I thought that was the government's
position — that on*”base military personnel in uniform are to
be divorced from active political participation?
MR. KAIRYSs Well, the question of whether they could
corae to cn® of these rallies which, first of all, are held on
off-duty times —- th® rally in this case was held on a Saturday,
in an off-duty time.

Th® question of whether they can corn© in

uniform or not, which I would probably agree with them on, is
a separate que^ion.
QUESTION? Well, then, you agree that there is — that
that is e. legitimate principle, I take it? you're just arguing
about whether it's applicable here.
MR. KAIRYS:

I wholly agree with neutrality of the

military as a principle.

I think that's extremely important,

but I don't 'think they are neutral when they allow one branch,
one group of candidates, th® major-party candidates, t© have
tills total barrage of access with one form of speech, the mass

42
media, and then deny something which 1 believe also they are
entitled to on the base, since it’s open and there’s no counterveigning military interest, they deny them the right to faceto-face speech»
QUESTIONS But their answer to that is that it*s one
thing for an individual, perhaps in fatigues, perhaps in
uniform, to go into the PX, buy a copy of Newsweek or Time,
and go back to his bunk, go back to -the day room, and read what
it has to sayj and

quit© another thing to get an assemblage

of two or -three thousand people in a parking lot and have a
political address»
MR. KAIRYS;

Well, first of all, —
\

QUESTIONS
MR. KAIRYS:

Now, that has some —
— Colonel O'5 *©n indicated that he saw

no problem with people talking ©bout the campaign, it
all the time,

happenad

And they stand around and they do talk ©bout the

campaign, groups of soldiers.
5,000 civilians.

They also allow events that have

They allow a rock concart out on a ball field,

with 5,000 people —
QUESTIONS But that would have nothing to do with the
divorce between military in uniform and political.
MR. KAIRYSs That’s correct, but it certainly indicates
/

that you can’t say — as the Court of Appeals says, you can’t
really find, per 'se, the possibility of disruption.
that's a separate issue,

And I think

but the neutrality issue, it seems to

43

me, is a feigned neutrality, as the Court of Appeals said»
They're maintaining a neutrality as to one form of speech.
When the real question,, in terms of neutrality, is over-all
neutrality,
1 mean, hew can they seriously say that the military
is being neutral at Port Dix, when this ad, at page E~3 of
Appendix II, this ad urging the re-election of President Mixon
at the time of the hearing in this case was in Army Times,

The

most predominant newspaper on the base,
QUESTION s

Their argument, I take it, is that their

neutrality requires that the type of active political rally
not b® held on the military base, and that nobody of any party
can hold that kind.

Mow, you say it's ~~

MR, KAIRYSt

That's not neutrality,

QUESTIONt Well, it’s a form of neutrality.

You're

saying that because your man doesn't have access to the other
materials that come out in quite a different way, it's not
neutralityy but it's really just not neutrality that is
completely fair to your man,
MR, KAIRYSs
could afford it or not,

Mo,

[sic]
No, irregardless of whether they

it simply isn't neutrality.

to me, should refer to all forms of speech.

Neutrality.,

If you're going to

let one group of candidates get exposure — to m© exposure is
the issue — if on© group can get exposure on the base by one
form, then you're no longer neutral,

Neutrality is out of the

44
question»

And the question becomes:

Is it appropriate, or is

there any reason why you shouldn’t allow other candidates to
use this other form?
QUESTION5 Well, but the Court has always treated
differently rallies and parades, which are subject to fairly
rigorous tima/place restrictions»
MR» KAIRYSs That’s right»
QUESTION? Certainly the State couldn’t impose the
same kind of restriction on selling magazines at a. newsstand»
MR» KAIRYSs

No, I’m not asking that»

I’m saying that

if civilians generally have the right to exercise First
Amendment rights on the base, which I believe they do because
the has® is open and because there’s no specific concrete mili­
tary interest that competes with it, these are open areas,
streets, sidewalks and parks, there is no nearby courthouse,
there is no nearby jail or anything like that, that one®
civilians generally have the right to exercise that right, and
once you allow other parties, the majority parties, to come on
in soma form, to get exposure, there’s no reason not to allow
these candidates to exercise that face-to-face right.
There’s no reason based in neutrality or disruption
or anything else.
I think, if 1 can get back briefly

MR. KAIRYSs

You can mail all the leaflets*

Well, that*s an extraordinary — there’s

22,000 scIdlers.
QUESTION* Well, are you arguing equal protection now?
MR. KAIRYSs
you

Yes, we do.

And the question is, even if

have some alternative, that I believe is not sufficiently

affected, but

even if you have soma alternative, what is the

government interest?

It seems to me the burden should be there.

What is the government interest in not allowing them to do the
face-to-face speech?
QUESTION *
ovm ground yet.

Well, you haven't met the government on its

You’ve talked just discrimination and non­

neutrality? but you haven’t really faced up to whether or not
there’s anything of substance to the government’s position that
there’s some inconsistency between overt political activity
in uniform, on a base, and. being a soldier.
MR. KAIRYSs Well, I think the uniform issue is a
separate issue.

If they want to prohibit any military personnel

47
from viewing any political ©vent in uniform, as they've done,
then there's a question —» th©r® could be a question? I don't
think there is — as to whether -that's valid or not.
But that's a separate issue, as to whether they could
come on cr not. They stand there and they read that ad in
uniform.

I mean, anyone can, in the local newspaper, say, the

Army Times, which is sanctioned by the post and is censored
by the pest authorities, approves an ad in that *—

would you say that you had a case with respect to this fort if,

Most of them are

QUESTION$ Well, ~
MR. KAIRYSs That's in the testimony of the Provost
Marshal.

You mean you want a captive audience,

is that it?
MR. KAIRYS?
55 square miles.

Well, they’re hardly captive.

It's

QUESTIONs

But -they aren’t spread equally over the

55 square miles, are they?
MR» KAIRYSs

Well, this area that this rally was held

was on a parking lot adjacent to a movie theater»
six different movie theaters on the base.
raovi® theaters.

There are

It was one of six

It was called Theater V,

Now, there's certainly no aspect of a captive
audience.

This is an outside area.

It’s literally 55 square

miles, and no one had to attend tills,
QUESTIONs Well, but don't you have some of the same
problems pou had with the Hatch Act?

If you know your Colonel

is going, and your Major is going, and they’re supporting this
candidate, there’s a certain compulsion on you to show up, too,
isn't there?

Particularly if they mention it to you.

MR, KAIRYSs

I don't see that that. «■- no.

X don’t,

Any more than there's

compulsion, say, to back President

Why —
QUESTION

%

Well, but don't you think if the government

can ban that sort of compulsion under the Hatch Act for civil
servants, it cam follow this procedure here?
MR, KAIRYSs Well, I don't consider going to a rally
and hearing someone speak, participation.

And even the

military's own regulation, itself, says that common sense shall
apply fco "that regulation.

I don’t consider that participation.

49

Weil, I would just like to come back to that quote
briefly# if 2 can

is my time up?

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

No# that's your five

minutas„
MRo KAIRYSs

That's my five minutes? okay*

MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
MR» KAXRYSs

About four minutes left»

I think the case hinges# in addition to

this neutrality question# on whether civilians generally have
the right to exercise First Amendment rights on these portions
of the base»

And that# again# I would subject to the Court's

usual analysiso

And an observation that views might be

expressed that could underlain© is hardly sufficient# as a
military —* as a government interest# to override interest in
freedom of speech»
And X think that if the Court allows that kind of
observation to h® held sufficient to impose a prior restraint,
that that's a serious problem, and -that they've don® exactly
what# in -She quote# they said they didn't want to do? they
have deprecated the value of freedom of speech»
I*d just like to briefly address# then# the second
issue# concerning the prior restraint on leaflets»
It seems to me that if the Court agrees that civilians
do have the right to exercise First Amendment rights on these
areas, because they are essentially public streets# sidewalks#
and parks# and because there's no military interest to do other-

50

wise, then th© corollary right of being free of a prior
restraint as to content# it seems to ms# would follow,

And the

petitioners# in their brief# actually concede that.
So if the Court accepts that analysis# it seems that
there is no problem as to the second point.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well# —

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question# Mr, Kairys?
is
The order before us/a permanent injunction against interfering
with the distribution of campaign literaturein unrestricted
areas.

Does the record define precisely what those areas are?
MR, KAIRYSs Well# it defines them as — in a negative

way.

It defines them as any area not marked "Restricted".

And they ar© prominently marked.
does define them.

And there's testimony that,

Th© barracks ar® restricted# and so no one
And w® accepted their definition of restricted#

w® never challenged anything they said in that regard.
And we never sought to go inside of any building.
QUESTIONs

Right.

The residential areas# as I recall#

war© not marked 3restricted'’.
MR, KAIRYSs

That's correct.

The barracks were#

though.
QUESTIONs

What's the difference between th® barracks

and the residential areas?
MR, KAIRYS: The residential areas# at least the way

51
I consider them, are where there’s a whole row of houses,
almost like a settlement, where families live, The barracks
are where the troops are billeted,

residential areas, —.
MR, KAIRYS;

Yes, —

and probably the officers,
You think the record is clear as to the

areas, because the injunction imposes severe risk on <—
MR, KAIRYSs Well, that was limited m a result of
the crdas as to the specific rally, it limited the areas in a
more defined way,

And it

said where leafletters could go

and where they couldn’t, and it said exactly where the rally
would b©„

And that was arrived at by negotiation between

counsel.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr, Solicitor General.

Wo’ll let you complete your argument before we recess for lunch,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, BOFJCs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court 2
There are just a few matters I would like to clear up.
There has been repeated reference to the Array Times,

52

which appsars in th© second part of the Exhibit* Plaintiff8 s
Exhibit 7* on E-3, and a censorship by the base, or something
©£ that sort,
I think it should be made perfectly clear that the
Army Timas is a civilian publication, it is not published by
th© Army, the Army has no control oyer it'.

That ad could appear

in th© New York Times and come on the base, as well.
As to the other points I wish to touch upon, there’s
reference to the fact that the candidates can't get at these
soldiers because they ®r© confined to the base,

Th© truth is

only the trainees are confined to the base for the first four
weeks of their training, which moans that there are three weekends, total, denied to respondents in their efforts to reach
these gentlemen off th© base,
Mr, Justice White mentioned the fact that coming
onto the base was an attempt to appeal to soldiers as soldiers,
and I think that's crucial,
1 would refer the Court to the first volume of the
Appendix, in several places, but particularly at page 178, where
Mr, Hardy testifies to th© reason he wants to get back onto
leaflet.

He sayas
"There are troops in both Thailand and th© Gulf of

Tonkin which could b© easily r©~introduced into acme active role
there, so anti-war activity among G,I,*s is still, in my
opinion, and in the opinion of Resistance, an important aspect

53
of our work in something we need to continue.”
There is no doubt, that this leaf letting and this
speech was aimed at these people,, not

because they were an

enclave of citizens they could not reach; but because they were
soldiers whom they wished to influence in their attitudes
toward th© war,.

—'

Now# 1 suppose I should say something about Flower»
since it's been discussed repeatedlyQ

The picture» E-2, which

w€5 have been asked to look at, is entirely different from the
/

pictura 1 recall seeing of N©w Braunfels Avenue.

You can see

an obvious line where the town stops. There is an ordinary
civilian cor«saunity» with cleaners and laundries and pisza
houses and so forth theref and suddenly all of that community
activity stop® and yousr@ clearly on & military base.
So it*s not indistinguishable from the community,
there's a clear line.
Here, Mr. Hairy® says, quit© correctly, that there
was no abandonment in this case.

Military jurisdiction over

even traffic violations is complete, and any case goes to a
U*. S. magistrate or, if necessary, to a U. S. court.
QUESTIONt

Mr. Solicitor General, what difference

would it make if the topography and color of the highway
pavement and the quality of the sidewalks and the kinds of
houses wera exactly the same before you got on the base and
after you got there?

What's the difference ~~

54

MR. BOEKii

I don’t think it would make ~

QUESTION s

Just the difference that soldiers

exclusively occupy the base.
MR, BORKs

I don’t think it would make any difference,

Mr. Chief Justice, because all of the policy reasons would
apply, ard that’s why I don’t believe in this expanded reading
that we’re getring of the Plower oa.H&o
Because if that’s what Flower really meant, then it
really is & trivial point, and I can’t believe that it is.
It becomes a trivial point in that all the military need do is
spend tho additional money to put a sentry at the post and say,
'’Show me your pass" or HGat a pass,”

What that has to do with

political campaign rallies on the base, I don’t

know.

I don’t

see the iexus between spending the money to close the base in
that sens® and the First Amendment question and the separation
of military and -QUESTIONS

Indeed, some bases do have a sentry box

there, and they have a fence around them.

But I take it from

•fdie arguments made that the same arguments would be advanced
if there was a ten-’foot wall and two sentries at the gate.
MR. BORKs

I take it so, because if the point is that

the base commander must use his troops to compensate Dr. Spock
or other minor-party candidates for an inability to get a good
Nielsen rating, then I think it. wouldn’t matter whether there4d
a wall or whether the base is ©pen.

55

And I would point one© more to Lloyd Corporation v.
Tanner and# indeed, to Grayned v® City o£ Rockfordf which said
that even a public sidewalk could bo denied its us© for soma
purposes,, because of the interest in running schools,,

I think

the interest her®# in the separation of the military and the
political# is clearly of that caliber? and# furthermore, it is
not a put-lie sidewalk# it is a military base, which, by
tradition in this country# has been closed to this kind of
activityo
MR®' CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen®

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12s04 o’clock, p0m® , the eas® in the
above-entitled matter was submitted®]
