MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Hancock,, the Attorney General of Kentucky,
against Train, Administrator of ERA.
Mr. Beals, you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. BEALS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BEALS5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case arises on a writ of certiorari to the
Sixth Circuit, to review that Court's interpretation of the
\

Clean Air Act amendments of 1970, as that Act concerns the
relation of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the operator,
and the respondent operators of existing federal air contamin­
ant sources located in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
With "the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the
Congress set forth a clearly defined and discernible plan
for the enhancement and enforcement and protection of the
air resources of the United States.
Basic to this plan were minimum standards to be
prescribed by the EPA Administrator under Section 109.

The

i

Congress stated the means by which these standards would be
put into effect in Section. 107, directing that -the States
were to prepare implementation plans to achieve and maintain
the national primary and secondary ambient Air Quality

4
Standards„
That these plans were State plans is entirely
consistent with the rest of the scheme of the Act.

In 101(a),

one of the findings of the Congress with respect to air
pollution was that it was the primary responsibility of the
State to control air pollution at its source,
Indeed, Section 101(b) listed as one of the purposes
of the Act the

to assist the States and local governments

in the formulation and execution of their air pollution
programs.
As to what these programs should, at a minimum,,
contain, Congress was also very explicit.

In Section 110 they

listed a number of requisites which had to be included in any
110 implamentation plan.
Among these, the basic requirement of the plan, was
that the plan provide for the attainment of the primary
standards as expeditiously as possible.

And in no case more

than three years following approval.
Also required in 110 were provisions for emission
limitations, schedules, timetables for compliance, and such
other measures as might be deemed necessary to meet these
standards.
But, in addition to these emission standards, 110
also specified that the States had to incorporate into their
plan appropriate devices, methods, and systems for monitoring,

5
compiling and analysing data and making this data available to
the Administrator? appropriate procedures and systems for
reviewing the location of new sources? appropriate procedures
to insure that no emission in one Air Quality region would
cause or interfere with the attainment of the standards in any
other Air Quality region»
It also called for adequate personnel, funding, and
authority on behalf of the State to carry out the plan»

It

required that the plan have authority to require the installa­
tion of monitoring equipment, to require periodic reports from
the air contaminant, sources ? to correlate this data received
from these reports to the emission standards that were
currently existing, and to ~ it required authorization to
restrain any air pollutant source which was presenting an
imminent and substantial danger to the health.
It is the contention of the Commonwealth of Kentucky
that these requirements, all of the requirements listed in
lit-0, all the

requirements which are contained in the State's

implementation plan are requirements respecting the control
and abatement of air pollution,
QUESTION;

Mr. Beals, would you envisage situations

where 'Idle State would not grant a federal installation a
permit?
MR. BEALS;

Yes, Mr. Justice, I envision a situation

where if the control strategy proposed by a federal source will.

6
in the opinion of the State Air Pollution Control Agency, not
result in the attainment of the ambient standards, will not
result in the meeting of the emissions standards, that that
federal source would have to redraft its control strategy, its
compliance schedule,so that it vrould indeed meet these
standards, as required by the Act.
QUESTION:

So you would stop it at the permit stage,

rather than later?
MR. BEALS:

The permit — at the permit stage, these

things can be worked out,

We say, "Your strategy is not

sufficiently stringent to meet our standards; your emissions
are too high to maintain the air quality required.

Therefore,

you have to incorporate more standards."
This is an opposed to later finding that they are,
indeed, ii yiclation of the standards and presumably shutting
them down.

That is a possibility.

It’s highly unlikely that

any of the agencies would be, indeed, shut down, but they vrould
be subject to daily •—*
QUESTION:

So you’re zeroing in on something more

than merely identification of the source of pollution? you
want

—
MR. BEALS:
QUESTION:
MR. BEALS:

We are indeed, Your Honor.
to withhold at the permit stage?
The implementation plan, as expressed

by Congress, contains considerably more than just identifica-

7
tion of the sources of pollution, and it contains considerably
more than simply emission standards, it contains the entire
mechanism for bringing these standards into being, for —
QUESTION;

And you could do that by a compulsion

suit later, couldn’t you, after the permit is issued?
MR. REALS:
Honor.

That would hardly be prevention, Your

We might be able to abate any violations that came

up later, but it would hardly relate to any sort of preventive
concept.
It seems the time for prevention is before the
attainment

dates.

What we're talking about is 'the pre-

attainment period, seeing to it that these control strategies
are moving in the proper direction? that the strategies will
indeed result in reduced emissions, will indeed result in the

air quality of the entire Air Quality Control region being
raised to a level acceptable under trie minimum primary and
secondary standards.
QUESTION:

Did not the Environmental Agency state

that it would submit all of the information which is called
for by the application, but would not submit it in the form of
an application for reasons which were given?
Now, doesn't that give you everything that the
application would give you?
MR. BEALS;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that gives

everything that the application would give you, but it does

8

not give you

what the permit requires»

The application for a

permit is not an automatic issuance of a permit»
QUESTION;

Well, as Mr. Justice Blackmun suggested,

why not wait until you have the problem,, and then go in on the
enforcement, where the Environmental Agency raises no question?
MR. BEALS;

Once again, Your Honor, the ambient

standards are interfered with, the attainment and maintenance
of the ambient standards are interfered with.

If we wait

until
QUESTION;

Well, can't you tell them that when they

submit the data that they have offered?
MR. BEALS;

But the data they offer is just a

That is a listing of —

QUESTION;

Isn’t that tha same thing you get in an

application?
MR. BEALS;
the application.

Yes, but. the process does not stop at.

The process goes on.

We use the information

we get from the application to determine which

what sort of

controls are necessary to determine what kind of emission
standards are necessary to be imposed.

This does not stop

with just getting the information and finding out where we are
and waiting until three years later to sea if we got any
better.
QUESTION;

You say if you had the authority to

require a permit, you could say no to an application, whereas,

3
if you don't have the authority to require a permit, all you
can do is kind of file what they're doing and not say no?
MR, BEALS:
do right now.
three years.

That is correct, that is what we can

That is what we have been doing for the last
We have been —-

QUESTION:

Well, if you read the government's brief,

you get the impression that the government installations will
fully comply with the substantive requirements, and presumably
EPA, if that's who is regulating the government installations,
would be saying no in place of the State agency.

MR. BEALS:

That would have been fine, if the

Administrator had come in in 1972, when -- under 313, when
the implementation plan broke down, when they refused to comply

with the implementation plan»

What the installations, what

•the respondents have done so far is, whan requested, -*-* not on
the basis of a periodic report

when requested, they have

submitted a status report.
This is not a — this is not similar to a compliance
schedule.

The respondents are not operating under any

approved compliance schedule, because the compliance schedule
is the end result of the process that starts with the permit
application.
The position of the government that 'they are to
comply with compliance schedules and emission standards is
generally hard for me to follow, since there are no compliance

\

10

schedulas.
QUESTION?

Does the compliance schedule originate

at the time the permit is issued?
MRc BEALS;

That*s correct? Your Honor,

The way

the Kentucky permit system functions ? the information is
received on the application? that information is analyzed to
see what steps are necessary to bring the source into

If the source is already in compliance., then a permit

may be issued.

QUESTION;

Well? Mr. Beals? the information that

the government did furnish you? was that accepted or rejected?
MR. BEALS;

It was taken as what it was.

It was the

Well? if it had been in the form of an

application for a permit? would a permit have been issued or not?
MR. BEALS;

In some cases perhaps it would have been?

QUESTION; Well, I mean, you just want 'the formality
of asking for a permit?

standards.

MR. BEALS;

No, we want the cooperation ~™>

QUESTION;

I’m talking about those that did meet the

The only thing you object to is that the government

didn't, also say "We want a permit"? is that right?
MR, BEALS;
QUESTION;

Well, they did not apply for a permit.
But they gave you all the information

that -they would have given if they had applied for a permit.
MR. BEALS;

Only those few sources, and I’m not

sure how many of them there are, which would be in compliance.
In fact, the information on the application is just
the preliminary information through which the analysis should
start.

It would still require some further information,

further cooperation by the respondente ? as to those sources
which would not be in compliance —
QUESTION:

Have you asked them for -that information?

MR. BEALS;

We have asked for further information.

We get status reports,
QUESTION;
for a permit?

That’s all you asked for, that they apply

MR. BEALS %

But in asking that they apply for a

permit, we're asking that they submit to our entire implementa­
tion plan system.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought, you just want

them to go through the formality in soma instances.
MR. BEALS;

Well, in 'the instances where they

aren't already in compliance, I agree that they *— if they
applied for a permit, they might be — they would be granted a
permit.

But those are very few and far between sources

which are already in compliance, have all the emissions
standards? in addition, the information that we gather from
these applications is necessary in order to determine what,
levels — at what level the emissions standards should be
set.
It is not just an automatic process that they apply
for a permit, they get a permit.
What they have to do is to go through the permit
process.

The determination is made of whether or not these

strategies will bring them into compliance with the ambient
standards, they will be in compliance with the emissions
standards, which are set, through the information.

The Air

Quality Control region is analyzed to determine what sources
are there, what levels of control need to be placed on these
sources.
Only through this process can the emissions standards

13

be set,
Nowi the fact that the initial information was put
in is just the very first step in the whole permit process,
There is a considerable amount of planning required in
determining how to bring a plant, such as the Shawnee Power
Plant of the Tennessee Valley Authority, into compliance with
thi& amission standards within three years.

In fact, it has

not been done.
Under the system that the government suggests, where
the only standards which they have to meet are the emission
standards and compliance schedules, this is very similar to
the method of implementation that was considered in Train, when
they discussed the Florida method, where they were just told;
In three years you have to be in compliance.
And th at was it.
This was a method that was discouraged by UPA,
This is the method we have,

We say:

We’re turning you loose,

but in three years you have to be there.
The State suggested this as a regulatory statute,
that the State has some expertise in determining what their
Air Quality Control regions require in terms of emission
standards.

There in developing these amission standards for

the particular area, for instance, the Louisville Air Control
Region has considerably more stringent standards than the
Bowling Green Air Control Region.

14
This is developed through a complete control over
each stationary source in the Commonwealth.

We have to analyse

the data from each of these sources in order to make the
standards for all.
Further, the Section 118 ~~
QUESTION;

You haven't, at least for me, fully

answered the questions of Justice Blackmun or of Justice
Marshall, or the ones I was trying to put.
If tie Environmental Agency is prepared to have the
federal facility do everything that it would do, except the
formality of the application, and that you're free to respond
in the same way to that as you would be to a formal application, in terras of setting up a schedule, then what are we
really here for?
MR. BEALS;

We're here for the fact -that they have

not done that.
QUESTION:

Well, but had you responded to the

informal approach just the way you would to a formal application?
MR. BEALS;

Perhaps not, but we haven't had the same

information.
QUESTION;

MR. BEALS:

That's exactly the point.
Well, the informal approach, nonetheless,

is totally unrelated to our implementation plan,that Congress
said that we had to have this authority, they said that this

15
is essential to achieve these plans.
has

And what the government

or what these respondents have declared is that none of

these other things are essential to achieving these standards
except the emission standard.
They ignore the way the compliance schedules com®
into being.

They have not -- as I say, we have not gotten

control strategies from these sources.
They says

We get status reports.

Right now we're putting out this much emission?

we're installing this sort of equipment,
There's no opportunity to review control strategies.
There's no opportunity to review the control strategies in
light of the rest of the Air Quality Control Region.
QUESTION:

Mr6 Baals,, may I ask a question?

Is

there anything in the statute that provides in substance that
if the point source is in compliance with the standard, that
it's emitting the wrong kind of material, but does not have a
permit, that it's in violation of the federal statute?
Does the federal statute require a permit and
provide that the failure to have a permit, there's some kind of
remedy for that, even though there's compliance with the
substantive standards?

)
MR. BEALSs

Not specifically, Your Honor.

The

federal statute requires that the States draw '-up an implementa­
tion plan containing a certain set of authorities„
Now, the majority, a substantial majority of the

16
States have adopted a permit system in order to accomplish this.
The permit system integrates all the requirements that on® can,
it integrates all the control necessary? and
QUESTION;

So it's purely a State requirement, the

permit itself?
MR» BEALS;

It is a State -- well, it has been

approved —
QUESTION;

It's a State method for implementing

Section 110, I gather.
MR. BEALS;

Well, it is a — yes.

But it has been

approved by the federal EPA, it has been published as regula­
tions of the federal EPA.

In effect, the Kentucky implementa­

tion plan is the federal implementation plan for the Common­
wealth of Kentucky.
QUESTION;

The reason I asked, I was wondering what

would happen if the federal point source were in compliance
with the substantive standard and simply refused to get a
permit, what statutory

what federal statutory remedy would

there be that Kentucky could assert against the federal point
source?
MR. BEALS;

The federal statutory authority?

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. BEALS;

I take it there would be none.

QUESTION;

So there really wouldn't be --

MR. BEALS;

However, Section 118 clearly makes — it

17
is the statute, federal statutory authority which makes all
State and federal requirements respecting control and abatement
of air pollution applicable to each of these federal respondents.
In -that regard, what we adopt as a federal require»
ment — as a requirement respecting control and 'abatement
under Section 110,, which is republished as a federal requirement
respecting control and abatement of air pollution by the
federal EPA, we would think that those would be federal

This is exactly the same thing that the implementa­
tion plan required the State to do in 1972, which the
Commonwealth of Kentucky did do, and had that system been
allowed to function as it should, not only as Kentucky law but
as a federal regulation for Kentucky, then the same thing that

others.

Right.
It’s in Tennessee and Alabama, and perhaps

If Kentucky undertook to shut down a part of the

Tennessee Valley Authority, would that have an impact on its
operations in other States?
MR. BEALS:

Well, I take it that it would, but the

possibility of shutting down TVA altogether is very, very
remote,

We would be going after penalties in terms of —

as a matter of fact, the State of Alabama has recently filed
suit against the Tennessee Valley Authority for exactly — for
violating emission standards under their implementation plan.

In that case they are seeking substantial penalties
until the source is brought into compliance.
QUESTION;

That the TVA and Fort Knox would be subject to the substantive

MR. BEALS;

That’s correct. Your Honor.

But, as it

comes in, then they aren’t subject to the means of reaching
those ends that every other public utility in -the Commonwealth
of Kentucky has to go through.

They have to come in with a

will get then to that point, other than to just say that three

That’s not what the State does. The State comes in
and-they plan it. They see to it.

agreements which are exactly identical in every respect to

to that the federal Administrator is talking about bringing
these sources into compliance as expeditiously as practicable.
We were talking about bringing them in in three years.
We were talking about trying to arrange it so that they would
be in compliance at the end of a three-year period.
EPA apparently is still not talking about that.
I would like to reserve what time I have remaining
for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Friedman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like at the outset to advert to the question
that Mr. Justice Rehnquist just, put to my opponents

what, if

anything, the Environmental Protection Agency is doing to
insure compliance by federal facilities with State pollution
standards?
It’s doing a great deal.

It has its own office,

called the Office of Federal Activities, whose sole function
is to insure that federal facilities do coma into compliance.

24

The record contains numerous items of evidence
showing that the various federal facilities in the Commonwealth
of Kentucky have supplied a great deal of information, a great
deal of data, have worked closely with the State authorities
to insure that, as quickly as possible, the federal facilities
do come into compliance with the State emission standards»
That’s what we're talking about, the substantive
standards that ilia State has imposed in implementing the
federal plan -QUESTION:

Can it be candidly said, Mr, Friedman,

that the EPA is treating the 'federal facilities just as the
Kentucky agency would ba treating private facilities?
MR» FRIEDMftNs

I think it can»

We endeavor to do

that, and, indeed, there’s a document in the record, a
direction from the Regional Administrator which instructs
all the federal facilities to work closely, to cooperate with
the State authorities, and to submit to them their own plans,
their own schedules.
There’s a great deal of informal discussion and
communication.

I mean, the compliance standard for a major

installation is not a simple thing, it's very complicated.
There are all sorts of standards.
the technology available.

There are problems about

It's not something, unfortunately,

that can be done very quickly.

It does take time.

But the federal facilities are moving as rapidly as

25

possible to try to accomplish this„

And this is, we think,

precisely what Congress intended in Section 118 of the Act,
when it said that the federal facilities are to comply with
State and local requirements with respect to the emission of
pollutants.
The question in the case, basically, is whether,
when Congress used that word "requirements" in there, it.
intended — it intended also to subject the federal
instrumentalities to the various procedures that the State
might work out in order to accomplish compliance within the
State with these various requirements.
QUESTION?
States has its own

I suppose it’s possible that each of the
it's likely that they each have their

own schedules and own notions about how the compliance can be
accomplished, so that there would be no uniformity applicable
to all federal installations.
MR. FRIEDMAN?

Is that likely?

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

because not all States have permits — some call them permits,
some call them registration? there6s a wide variety in the
plans„
But I think it's essential, and I think this has
been, brought out in the colloquy with my opponent, as to what
we're really talking about here.

What the State is saying is,

it wants the authority to control the way in which the federal
instrumentalities are operating within the Commonwealth of

26
Kentucky.
What the federal
provides is that you

what the State permit regulation

must have a permit in order to construct,

use, operate, or maintain an air contaminant facility.

And

I think it was brought out vary clearly that if the State
believes that Fort Knox is not complying with its standards,
it can shut down Fort Knox.
And I think this whole concept — this whole concept
that the State somehow has a veto power over the operation of
federal facilities runs and flies in the face of the juris­
prudence of this Court for more than 150 years, that ordinarily,unless there's a clear indication that Congress intended it to
do so, that the federal facilities are not subject to control
by the States, and that the States cannot require federal
facilities to obtain a permit
QUESTION:

Well, everybody agrees with that statement,

I think we don't need to go into that, Mr. Friedman.
The question in this case is the meaning of Section

110.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

And whether in 118 Congress has

— precisely and clearly

That's the issue? that's the only issue.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

•— indicated that the federal

facilities are — but I think in determining -- I think, Mr.

Justice* in determining whether 118 has that effect* it's
important to keep in mind this broad background —
QUESTION:
you win.

But if it doesn't have that effect* then

That's all.
MR. FRIEDMAN?

That's correct.

QUESTION? And if it does* you lose.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

That is the thing.

But our submission is -- our submission is that
before one can conclude that Congress intended to subject the
federal facilities to this kind of State control* there has
to be some clear indication that Congress did so.
And our submission is that there's nothing in this
statute that indicates that Congress intended to subject the
federal facilities to State permit requirements.
My opponent has conceded there’s nothing explicit.
And when one looks at the legislative history
QUESTION?

Well* what you — he concedes what, Mr.

Friedman?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I thought

I thought* as I understood

him to say
QUESTION;

He says the plain meaning of the

language is very explicit* as I understood him.
That's quite a lot for him to claim.

I mean* that’s

— he says this statute on the States covers it.
MR. FRIEDMAN?

Well* but he's conceded — he has

28

conceded, Kr„ Justice, —
QUESTION:

But he conceded nothing else, maybe.

In this case,
MR© FRIEDMAN:

No, he's conceded there's nothing

in the statute that explicitly refers to permits,
QUESTION: Well, there's nothing in the statute that
refers to substantive requirements, either.
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

It does use the word '’requirements”,

Well, it doesn't say "substantive" in

the provision,
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

And it doesn't say "procedural".

MR. FRIEDMANS
QUESTION:

It doesn't say "substantive", but.

It doesn't, but —

So which one would you like to leave out?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, it's not a —» with all due

respect, Mr. Justice, it's not a question of leaving it out.
QUESTION:

Well, which one would you think ought to

be included?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
only substantive,;

Only "substantive"; we think it means

And we think that is the — »

QUESTION: Well, why?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Why?

Because that is precisely, we think,

what -the legislative history of this statute shows, -that what
Congressw*s intending to do in this statute, and —
QUESTION;

But it leaves only substantive require-

29

merits f then,, isn't EPA under a duty to enforce just as
rigorously against the federal facilities the State's
substantive requirements, so that Fort Knox will be shut down
if it doesn't comply?

The only question is whether it will be

shut down by th'fi Kentucky Commission or by the EPA.
MR. FRIEDMANS Well, I don’t think that the shutting
down — I agree that the federal Administration is required to
enforce the standards just as rigorously as the States do,
and that’s precisely what we do.
But the question of shutting down Fort Knox, it
seems to me,

is not a substantive standard, and I would think

that that is a matter for the federal authorities to decide
if they think it is necessary to shut down Fort Knox because
it’s not complying with the pollution requirements.
QUESTION: Well, 'tilon you:'re talking about a good
deal more than just a permit requirement, you’re talking about
the remedies that may be imposed for failure to comply with the
substantive standard.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

But the remedies, Mr. Justice, the

remedies are themselves tied into the permit requirement,
because if you have a State permit requirement, then you cannot
operate unless you have obtained the permit.
Nov/, it seems to me that’s a very different kind of
thing than the situation where there is an obligation on ‘the
federal facilities to comply with the State’s substantive

30
standardso

But if — if there is non-compliance, there's two

remedies available;

either the State can sue, as the State of

Alabama is suing TVA; or, alternatively, -the federal
authorities can take whatever steps are necessary to bring the
State

the federal facilities in the State into compliance»
But that’s ~~
QUESTION;

But you say that even though the State

Commission dealing with, say, the Kentucky Power Company, if
it were doing the same thing, could order the facilities
shut down if it hadn’t complied in ninety days.
But EPAgiven precisely the same situation with
respect to the power plant at Fort Knox, can say;
around,

Try to come

as a matter of comity, in five years.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, it’s not

it doesn’t say, Mr.

Justice, with all due respect, to try to come around within
five years? they tell them 'that, they have to comply and they’re
taking every step possible to comply as rapidly as possible.
QUESTION;

Is there any remedy issue before us now?

Or is only the application question before us?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Well, the only question, really, is

whether the State can require the federal facility to obtain
a permit.
QUESTION;

So it will be another cases and another

day when we’d have to deal with the question of whether they
could close Fort Knox?

31

MR» FRIEDMAN ;

Yes , and I would hope we would naver

come to that? but the State apparently claims the power.
the thing.

That’s

Under the argument that it can apply its permits

to the federal facilities, the State would claim the power.
QUESTION?

Well, of course,, the President of the

United States has the -- you have that escape clause»
MR, FRIEDMAN; There is an escape clause, but it’s —
and it's been interpreted rather narrowly, because it says
,!in the paramount interest of the United Statas"»
QUESTION:

I would suppose the President could

interpret it ■— he can make a finding that it3s in 'the
paramount interest of the United States to keep Fort Knox open»
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes.

But it's not just that, it’s a

lot of other things in connection with 'the — the way in which
a federal facility operates»
For example,, one of the facilities involved in this
case is the AEC’s gaseous diffusion plant, which is uranium.
Now, I suspect there's probably a fair amount of pollution
involved in that, and steps, are being taken.

But the notion

that tie State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky can in effect say
to the Atomic Energy Commissions

Unless you don’t operate this

plant the way we want you to, you will get a permit and
threaten them with closing down.
It seems to me that before one could find that
Congress intended to give the States that kind of power, there

32

would have to be some very clear indication of it»
QUESTIONS
your position?

Mr» Friedman,

Assume the State

can I be sure I understand
assume a facility does not

comply with the substantive requirements, forgetting the
procedure and the permits for the moment -MR„ FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

~ and assume the President has not made

an exception? would you not agree that the State could then
close the facility down?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
down, Mr. Justice.
304

I wouldn't think it could close it

It could bring a lawsuit, under Section

—

QUESTION;

And wouldn't the lawsuit have merit?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

And I — of course

But the court would have to decide.

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

I would think so.

— the court would have to decide.

What would the defense be to such a

suit?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

I don't know ~

If you assume a violation of the

substantive requirement.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If one assumes it, I would think the

court would order them to comply.
And if they fail to comply, the court has whatever
sanctions are available to compel compliance.

33

I would assume that once a court told a federal
facility that it was not in compliance and ordered it to
comply, it would comply,,

One must as surae that, I think.

We don't have any question that we have to comply
with the standards.
Now, what does the legislative history show about
what Congress intended in Section 118?
The original bill that was passed by the House
directed that federal facilities were to comply with local
emissions standards, and the House Committee Report on the
bill said the same thing, 'that it would direct the ■ federal
/

facilities to comply with local emissions standards.
Now, if that's all you had, there couldn’t be much
question, we think, that compliance with local emissions
standards means that, and does not, mean complying with permit
standards.
The Senate Bill used different language.

It said it

should comply with the requirements in this Act in the same
manner as any other person should comply? but the significant
'thing to us is that the Senate Committee, in reporting this
bill, saw no difference apparently between the word "require­
ments" in this bill and "emissions standards" in the House
bill, because it said that 'the purpose of this section, using
the word "requirements'’ was to require federal facilities to
meat the emissions standards necessary to achieve ambient air

quality standards , as well as those established in

other

sections of Title I.
Now, when the Conference Committee carae along and
adopted the language now in the bill, "to comply with the
requirements to the same extent as every other person", what
it said is -that the language it was using required that the
government comply with requirements respecting control of air
pollution — it said the House Bill and the Senate Amendment
declared, that federal departments and agencies should comply
with applicable standards of air quality and emissions»
"Standards" ~~ standards of air quality and emissions
Nov/, if the Conference Committee believed that in
using the word of the Senate Bill, "requirements", rather than
using the word "emissions standards" of the House Bill,
that it was somehow changing the standard, it seems to us more
extraordinary that it didn’t indicate that»
To the contrary, what it indicated is that it viewed
the same two *— the two phrases as meaning the same thing»
And this is, I think, particularly brought out by
the fact that the very next sentence in the Conference Report
points that in one respect it was changing the bills.
said was;

What it

The Conference substitute modifies the House

provision to require that the President, rather than the
Administrator of BPA, be responsible for assuring compliance
by federal agencies»

35

Now, it pointed out the change it was making, in
saying that it was to be the President rather than the
Administrator of EPA who was responsible for insuring federal -compliance by federal agencies? but yet it treated the words
/

"emissions standards" and "requirements" in the two versions
of the legislation as meaning the same thing, and the same
thing it said it meant was standards of air quality and emission»
Moreover, it seems to us, it would be most extra­
ordinary, we think, that after the Conference Committee said
that it was giving the President responsibility for insuring
compliance with the standards of air quality emissions, that it
then would have turned around and expected that the President
would have to comply with the State permit provisions.
Now, we have set out at length in our brief a number
of respects in which we think the word "requirements" in the
statute reflects a congressional intention to cover only the
substantiva standards and not the procedural ones.
Many of them are rather detailed and technical, and
not particularly appropriate for oral presentation.
But let me just refer to one particular provision,
which I think dramatizes it very clearly.
That’s in Section 110(e)(1)(A), and it provides
that after the State has approved a plan for compliance, if a
particular emission source is unable to achieve compliance
with the deadlines because of technological problems, that

36

period for compliance may be extended.
How, there the requirements with which they can —
for which they can extend the time for compliance because of
technological problems, obviously refers to the substantive
standard, the problems that because of the lack of technology
they are not able to control particular emissions.

It can’t

refer, in any meaningful sense of the term, to any technological
problems with respect to seeking a permit.
And if what Congress was attempting to do in that
provision was to reach the permit thing, it seems to me it
would have put it in those terms 6
Now, we have a final point, which this Court relied
on in its Train opinion last year, which is that, the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is
the person charged with enforcing this statute, has interpreted
it as not applying to federal facilities.

He did it in a 1972

ruling, and a 1973 ruling.
I should mention that the 1972 ruling, which is
embodied in a letter from the Regional Administrator of EPA
in ‘the region involved here, at page 57 of tha Appendix, points
out the importance of the federal instrumentalities submitting
their compliance schedules.
It's not just the substantive standards.

The federal

instrumentalities are to meet the State compliance standards.
One final point.

There’s been a —

37
QUESTION;

The Administrator is a party to this

litigation, is he not?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

He is.

He is a party, but he was also a party in the Train
case, Mr. Justice, in which this Court placed considerable
reliance on his interpretation, And indeed, in most litigation
in which this Court has applied the principle of giving weight
to the administrative determination -QUESTION;

By rights, it does

MR, FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

It's usually a suit to challenge —-

It’s an advantage that the ordinary party

doesn't have.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

That's -- well, and the ordinary

party, however, doesn't have the expertise of the Administrator.,
There's been a great deal of discussion here by the
Commonwealth as to the importance and the desirability of
requiring the federal instrumentalities to obtain

permits,

•that this is the most effective way in which one can assure
compliance.
That, it seems to us, is a matter for the Congress to
consider, because we think that the statute, as it's written,
its language, its structure, its legislative history, rather
clearly indicates that Congress did not intend to subject the
federal facilities to State permit requirements.
QUESTION:

Mr, Friedman, —

38

MR. FRIEDMANs

If that is to be changed, we think it

is for Congress to change it,

And, rather significantly, there

is now pending before the Congress a rather lengthy bill which
would revise the Clean A„ir Act in many, many parti culars ,
And one provision of that bill would provide that from now on,
if this bill is passed, federal facilities would be required to
obtain permits from States if the States so require»
That, we think, is the way in which, if federal
facilities are to obtain permits, the Congress should make its
intention clear and explicit»
QUESTION?

Mr, Friedman, before you sit down, would

you say it's a fair summary of the legislative history to say
that it does not indicate that anybody actually thought of
the precis© problem that this case raises?
HR, FRIEDMAN:
fair summary of it.

I think that is a fair — that is a

And our answer is that in this kind of a

situation, unless Congress clearly intended to permit this
kind of State authority, it should not be implied.

It's the

kind of authority, we think, that has to be provided
explicitly»
