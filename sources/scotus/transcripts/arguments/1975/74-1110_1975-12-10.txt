MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

At 1 o'clock we will

hear arguments in No. 74-1110..
Miss Rose, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS MARILYN G. ROSE
ON BEHALF OF EASTERN KENTUCKY
WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, ET AL.
MISS ROSE:
it pleas© the Court:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
I am MariXy Rose.

I represent the

plaintiffs, petitioners in No. 74-1110 and respondents in
No. 74-1124.
This case involves the legality of a revenue ruling
issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 1969.

This revenue

ruling removed the longstanding decades“old free ser/ice
requirement which had always been required of charitable
hospitals.

There was no notice given to anyone when this

ruling issued, there was no opportunity given to anyone, the
public at large, or affected persons, to comment upon it or to
participate in its development.
solely upon statements in

..

The ruling on its face relied
writers for the law of

trusts that health, say, is charitable.
QUESTION:

May I ask, Miss Ross, isn't what you told

us about no hearing and no notice always true about rulings of
this kind?

Hasn't it historically always been true?
MISS ROSE:

Well, when the Internal Revenue Service

4
issues revenue rulings, they give no notice and opportunity
for comment.

One of the issues is, should this have been a

revenue ruling?
QUESTION:

Yes, and whether or not the other rulings

were rulings of this kind, I suppose is the question.
MISS ROSE:

Yes.

There are three substantive violations which
plaintiffs charge from defendants.

First and foremost,

plaintiffs charge that defendants exceeded their statutory
authority and in effect amended the Internal Revenue Code
when they permitted hospitals as charitable institutions to
limit themselves to serving only the paying public.
If the Court decides this issue against plaintiffs,
th@n our second issue is that this indeed, though it was
called a revenue ruling, should not have been a revenue ruling,
it was a substantive rule and defendants v/ere required to
proceed in accordance with section 553 of the Administrative
Procedure Act.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Rose, may I ask you kind of a

preliminary question as to how you plan to structure your
argument.

Ar© you going to discuss standing and the Anti-

Injunction Act and sovereign immunity at the latter part of your
argument?
MISS ROSE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Thank you

5

MISS ROSE:

Tha third violation, and this again is

if the Court rejects both our Internal Revenue Code and our
553 argument, is that nevertheless there was a violation of
section 706 of the APA,that this ruling was arbitrary and
capricious because the defendants would have to have considered
factors which they did not consider on the face of the ruling.
And, as Mr. Justice Rshnquist indicated, there are jurisdic­
tional issues which tha defendants have raised.

We believe

these jurisdictional issues can be best considered and under­
stood in context of the substantive issues, and for that reasor
we will address the substantive issues first.
Section 501(c)(3) and 170 of the Internal Revenue
Code has never accorded hospitals tax exempt status or
deductions to tha donors to the hospitals.

Unlike educational

or religious institutions which have their own independent
bases, hospitals have had to qualify as charitable institutions.
For decades the IRS has required that the charitable hospitals
provide either service exclusively to the poor or may provide
service to all persons in the community, rich and poor alike,
but they may not exclude the poor.

This is the consistent

position of every tax court and Federal court that has
considered the issue in the past 33 years.

There is no case

the defendants have cited where a hospital has been accorded
501(c)(3) status without there being a finding that tha
hospital gave free service.

6
This, indeed, is the similar position that IRS takes
for all other organizations which are eligible for the
statutory benefits, solely by virtue of being chairitable.
Every ruling which is cited in the defendants' brief, every
ruling which is cited in the amicus American Hospital
Association's brief, and every ruling which wo have found —
and this goes to date, to 1975 — requires that institutions
which are solely charitable as distinct from being charitable
and educational or religious or societies for the prevention
of cruelty to children, offer and must serve all persons in
the community, rich and poor alike.
This is also the position of all State charitable
cases, or virtually all State charitable cases.

The

defendants relied simply on a 30-year-old statement from
Scott on Trusts.

In 1939, as in 1967, the Scott treatise

states that health is charitable per s®.

But all the cases

that Professor Scott cites, the tax cases and charitable trust
cases also have this rich and poor alike requirement, indeed,
the gan@ral law of charitable trusts going back to England and
more ancient times has always considered that there are four
heads of charity.

Charity is either for the relief of the

poor, educational, religious, or there is a fourth hiad, and
the fourth head are things beneficial to th© community, but
things beneficial to the community must provide service to all
persons in the community, again, rich and poor alike.

This

7
beneficial to the community does not permit the exclusion of
the poor.
The defendants argue that the Treasury regulation
which issued in 1959 permitted them to make this change.
is absolutely untrue.

That

The Treasury regulation which issued in

1959 is an expansion statement on what is charitable.

But it

was broadened to include new purposes, such as combatting
discrimination, juvenile delinquency.

But there is nothing

on the face of the ruling, of the 1959 regulation, nor is
there anything in its published history to indicate that there
was a change and charitable organizations may serva only the
paying public.
In 1969'the American Hospital Association appealed
to Congress to make a change and give hospitals independent
status.

This change was rejected.

It was in the House bill.

Ths Senate Finance Committe® in October of 1969 considered the
issue, and the Senate Finance Committee deleted the House
amendment.

The statement for deleting the House amendment

took into account the fact three weeks earlier the Internal
Revenue Service had issued the revenue ruling that’s at issue
in this case.

But the Senate Finance Committee statsd flatly

that they were removing this provision, that the revenue
ruling at issue in this case did not conform to the Internal
Revenue Code, and they wanted to consider th® proposal in
context with th© implications on health legislation.

8
I think it's clear that the Congress need not
conform the statute to an administrative action, but
administrators are bound to conform their actions to legislative
enactment.
The court below recognized the judicial administrative
and legislative history I have discussed.
further.

But they went

They said that this need not always be the case, that:

defendants could take info account socio-economic changes.
They also made a statement that a so-called requirement of
emergency service in the revenue ruling nay be of greeter
beneficial value to ths poor than general hospital services,
including inpatient care.
Those socio-economic findings are legally infirm.
There is nothing on th© face of th© revenue ruling to indicata
whatsoever that any of these matters were taken into account
>

by defendants.
The appellate counsel in this case in th« Cc-urt of
Appeals balov; and in the Suprema Court is making this proffer,
this argument, but that should b© rejectcid as the Court of
Appeals decision should b® rejected.

I think there are many

cases of this Court that have stated flatly that the post hoc
rationalization of appellate counsel cannot substitute for
th© reason that the administrativa agency usad.

And the

administrative agency usad solely Scott on Trusts and
Scott in Trusts has said th® same thing» had this on©

9
sentence upon which they rely, since 1939.

And in 1939 and

through the 1940's and through the 1950's and through the 1960's,
yea, in the summer of 1969 the Internal Revenue Service was
still going after hospitals that refused to serve the poor.
The poor had to be served.
It is also factually infirm.
of time*

Because of theMimitatior

I will not go into all the details.

Our brief in

chief and the brief of the American Public Health Association
extensively discuss why it is factually infirm.

In sum, HEW,

which is the health expert agency in this country, finds there
are over 23 million people in this country whose incomes are
below the poverty guidelines, find at that time th® poverty
guidelines ware something like $4,400 a year for a f«aniiy of
four, that these upwards of 23 million people have neither
private nor public health insurance.
are including Medicaid.

And when we say that, we

Medicaid is a very limited program in

f

terms of eligibility of income and services.

It doesn't take

care of the poor.
The health policy of the United States has continued
to require that free service b© given.

The Kill-Burton prograrr

\

of HEW requires that free service be given.

Title 16 of the

si'sw Health Planning Act, December 1974, Congress specifically
said that if there will be a national health insurance
program, there is still a need to serve everyone in the
community, to serve th© poor.

10
The defendants have made a large argument that this
ruling doesn't deprive service to the poor, that there is sun
emergency room requirement in the ruling.
several respects.

We disagree in

First, they argue that the emergency room

has now become like a private doctor's office.

General

physicians' services do not exist in the emergency room.

The

ruling, secondly, on its face talks not about general emergency
room services, it talks about a dire emergency and that a
hospital cannot turn away somebody in a dire emergency.
And, thirdly, there is no requirement that people not be charge!.
The most they can say for this ruling is that people will not
be required to put up money up front to pay a preservice
admission if they come into an emergency room during a dire
emergency, maybe bleeding to death.

Thera is no free service

requirement.
Turning now to section 553 of the APA argument, which
this Court need net reach if they accept our primary argument,
the Internal Revenue Service/ do®3 not deny that it is an
agency eubject to 553 and it cannot make such a denial.
says this ruling was interpreted.

It

We say that the Internal

Revenue Service is mislabeling this ruling.

This ruling on

its face has to be substantive.
In our principal brief wa have come up with what I
would call a functional task, but the lower Federal courts have
increasingly in recent years looked behind the label and said

11
is a rule,a policy of an agency,general longstanding, is it a
revision of a longstanding rule?
agency to educate itself?

Is there a need for an

What is the impact upon an industry?

What is the impact upon the public?

In every one of these

cases,' here is a major revision done without notice, without
an opportunity for comment, by an agency that knows virtually
nothing about health care.

It's

...

what the health care

agency of the United States is doing, let alone what
organizations like the American Public Health Association would
do.
QUESTION:

They know nothing about health care.

Do

we know more about it?
MISS ROSE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know if

this Court knows more about it, and I also don't know if the
Court of Appeals might know more about it, but what the
Court of Appeals did, they made findings.
...(Inaudible)

They made findings

They reached out and sustained this ruling in

the same way as if there was an attack on a congressional
statute for being unconstitutional.

The fact is the Court of

Appeals should have looked simply at the reason that was used
by the agency, Scott on Trusts.

They didn't look at that.

They reached out and made socio-economic analyses.

They were

going beyond their power.
So I think all this Court with this argument has
to determine is that this is th© kind of thing there should

12
have been hearings on.
Alternatively, if the Court feels a definitional test,
is the proper one, an interpretive rule is one that is limited
to a determination of Congressional purpose.

A substantive

rule is one which augments Congressional purpose and goes
outside the statute.

In this test, too, this is a substantive

rule.
I will not go into our alternative section 706, the
APA argument.

I think it's clear that the only way the

defendants feel that the ruling could be sustained is they had
to make the socio-economic argument.

It isn't on the face of

the rule, the agency didn't consider it, and therefore all
relevant factors weren't considered.

And this is Citizens to

Preserve Overton Park all over again.
I vrould lik© to turn to the jurisdictional argument
that defendants have proffered.

Defendants have come up with

what is a variety of jurisdictional barriers to plaintiffs’
maintaining this cause.

Their first argument is an attack upon

the rules laid down by this Court in Abbott Laboratories and
all other cases like it.

It's an attack upon the presumptive

reviewability of agency action.

I don't think that the IRS

intended to attack that for any other agency of Government but
itself.

It says it is somehow different.

But it has proffered

no justification for making the Internal Revenue Service
different from any other governmental agency.

QUESTION:

How about — you say very little in your

reply brief about our decision last spring in Warth v. Seldin.
Now, don't you think that has some bearing on the case?
MISS ROSE:

Yes, and if you like, I will turn to

Warth v. Seldin now, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Warth v. Seldin, of course, raises the question of
standing to sue* ^ Plaintiffs are poor people who are denied

where it's not just a direct causation, but if A hadn't done

and then my people would have been OK.

It's a fairly

attenuated kind of standing, isn't it?

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I disagree.

First, they would not only lose the power to be

is from charitable donations.

It is in the

tha testimony of th® American Hospital Association,

that charitable contributions to hospitals are what keep
hospitals going.

It makes tha margin of difference.

Further, as amicus, Jackson County, Missouri, ha3

17
pointed out in its brief that States follow what the Federal
Government does.

And if the hospital decided it would rather

not serve the poor and lose its tax exemption, it would be

paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxes eve:ry year on
the property on which it sits.

I just thought you ought to be waking a

MISS ROSE:

the proposition is that

Well, the standing basically is,
poor — I think I have prob.ibly

answered most of th® standing argument.
Seldin is not pertinent,

We think Warth v.

we think, because this particular

provision was designed to ameliorate conditions of the poor.
And it's th© obligation of this statute that hospitals are not
about to give up their tax exempt status.

And, three, the

last argument the Government raised, or I think they raised
it first, is this is prosecutorial. And this is not
prosecutorial.

Wa are not seeking the prosecution o-: anybody.

We are seeking a revocation of a ruling, and the order of the
district court which we would lik© reinstated is that this
\

ruling was invalid, hospitals have, to give free service, and
that the notification be mads to th© public, when tho Internal
Revenue Service publishes its Cumulative Bulletin, and if
hospitals in the future didn't want to give free service, they
could elect to bo pulled off that list* until they are pulled
off the list.

How about the sovereign immunity and the

There is no other

There is not a refund suit.

This isn't like "Americans United" trying to protect their

This has nothing to do whatsoever with the

assessment.
And sovereign immunity, we believe, has long since
been overruled in most respects the Government is arguing it.
Under Larson — this case is exceeding statutory authority,
and this is clearly the case —
QUESTION:

You don’t rely on Scanwell, and you simply

MISS ROSE:

Larson, if you find for some reason Larson doesn't apply, then
we are relying on Scanwell.
QUESTION:
MISS ROSE:

Which is not a case from this Court.
No.

The court below.

But basically we

are saying that for cases that are clearly APA cases, sovereign
immunity no longer exists.

This doesn't mean there isn't a

sovereign immunity argument on property cases, damage cases,
property held in th® name of the United States.

There is still

19

a sovereign immunity argument.

It just doesn't exist any more.

Or Abbott Laboratories and Barlow v. Collins and Data Processing
are all overruled.
I think I will sit.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH ON
BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
MR. SMITH:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The Government's position in this case simply is that

published revenue rulings, such as the revenue ruling at issue
here, do not present any issue for a Federal court to review,
and in that holding to the contrary, the decision of the Court
of Appeals is erroneous.
Before discussing in detail the various jurisdictional
barriers that we think exist to this suit, I think it would be
important to the Court to have before it what the essential
nature of a revenue ruling is, because in our view that
essential nature demonstrates that the jurisdictional holding
of the District of Columbia Circuit in this case would require
the Federal courts to render judgments in the most «distract
context.
Now, each year the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant
to its statutory authority under section 7805 of the Code,
issues some 40,000 advance letter rulings.

These advance

20

letter rulings set forth

its opinion of the Federal tax

consequences of specific proposed transactions.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Those are private.
Those are private.
Sent to an individual in response to an

individual inquiry.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
anonymously.

Exactly.
And a few of those are later published.
A few of those are later published

And of those 40,000 the Service selects and

edits several hundred for publication in its Internal Revenue
Bulletin in a more abstract and anonymous form.
Now, the introduction to the Internal Revenue Bulletin
on the first page has long stated that such rulings 3c not
have tha force and effect of law but are informational in
character only end represent the conclusions of the Service
as to the application of the tax law to whet is often an
abbreviated set of facts.
Tills Court in the Dixon case and many other cases
has undarscored and ratified that statement in the Conulativ®
Bulletin that these rulings are simply guidelines for IRS
personnel and to educate the public generally.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

How are these disseminated and published?
Mr. Justice Stewart, every two weeks

the Intarnal Revenue Service, I think, publishes something

21
called the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and then every six months;
or so those are bound in what is known as Cumulative Bulletins.
Those are distributed to people, officers of the Internal
Revenue Service, and people generally who are interested in
the development of the tax law.
QUESTION:

And private

tax lawyers can subscribe

to it.
MR. SMITH:

Private tax lawyers can subscribe, exactly.

And indeed anyone can subscribe to it.
QUESTION:

Anybody can.

You pay a fee and you get

it directly from the Internal Revenue Service.
MR. SMITH:

Right.

Now, these rulings contribute — they have a
salutary aim, they contribute to uniformity of interpretation
because, as I think the Court is well aware, it would be
unfortunate if two different Revenue agents in different
districts were to apply the tax law according to their best
lights but coming out with different results on what is an
identical set of facts.
QUESTION:

They do that occasionally in spite of

th© Bulletin.
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, we try our best, the

Internal Revenue Service, tries its best, but often mistakes
are made.
QUESTION:

They have a lot of them to deal with.

22
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

And these revenue rulings are

an attempt to mitigate and minimize those unfortunate
instances•
In any event, these revenue rulings contribute to
uniformity of interpretation, and in our view contribute to
the stability of the tax law by reducing controversies between
the Infernal Revenue Service and taxpayers because, as I think
t

the Court is well aware, taxpayers,many taxpayers, do not
like to litigate with the Internal Revenue Service.

They

would prefer to have an advance notice of what its position
might be on a particular set of facts, and this educational
program increases stability and reduces litigation

and the

attendant burdens on the Federal courts.
Now, the format of a revenue ruling is essentially
a statement of facts, and it's often abbreviated, with a
brief conclusion as to what the Federal tax consequences of
those facts are.

And the important thing is that the

Internal Revenue Services does abbreviate the facts in
publishing a revenue ruling, because whan the taxpayer makes
a submission to the Internal Revenue Service, he makes the
submission with a voluminous statement of facts, but the
Internal Revenue Service if it may select this particular
letter ruling for publication, it will boil this down and
essentially present the statement of facts which is designed
to illustrate a particular legal principle that it feels is of

23
general interest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, is it still true today, as I

think it was a hundred years ago when I was trying to practice
a

Rev. Rul., maybe with an exception or two, was about the

lowest form of animal life in the formal weight of —
MR. SMITH: I think that's so, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
/

The courts — of course, this gets into the argument about
%

notice and hearing requirements, but they are not binding on
the courts.

In fact, there are scores of cases which hold

that it simply is a statement of what the Internal Revenue
Service thinks the law is.
QUESTION:

I know we always hopefully looked for

a TD or something of a little —
MR. SMITH:

That is a higher form of tax life, there

is no doubt about that.
QUESTION:

The one w® are talking about here

begins on 6a of the appendix to your brief.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

That is Revenue Ruling 69-545.

Now, this ruling itself demonstrates the hypothetic^
quality of what the plaintiffs are seeking, the hypothetical
quality of the relief they are seeking, because as kh® Court
can readily se® in pursuing this Revenue Ruling, it sets
forth two polar situations, situation 1 and situation 2,
dealing with two hospitals, Hospital A and Hospital B.
In Hospital A, there are a variety of facts in connection

24
with Hospital A, it has an open board of trustees, it gives
open staff privileges, it is involved in research

and

educational activities, it maintains a full-time emergency
room, and no one requiring emergency care is denied treatment.
To the contrary, hospital B is almost proprietary in nature,
it’s owned by a small group of doctors, they limit the staff
privileges to people they know, and they comprise the
medical committee generally to keep out qualified physicians,
et cetera, et cetera, and it maintains an emergency room, but
basically to treat the patients of its own doctors.
*

Now, these two polar examples were designed to
educate the public generally and hospital administrators as
to clear-cut situations.

Hospital A is a situation, if you

are lik© Hospital A, you will be fairly certain of exemption,
but, of course, the ruling does conclude that you can't be
certain of that itself.

You have got to yourself submit an

application for exemption to the Internal Revenue Service.
If you are like hospital B, which is a polar
example of a hospital that doesn't seem to provide any
community benefit, it seems to be run pretty much strictly
for the private inurement of its owner-doctors.

In that

situation you are not going to get a tax-exempt status.
Now, the important thing which we emphasize is that
the ruling doesn't even begin to attempt to deal with the
hundreds of gradations in between Hospital A and Hospital B.

25
Hospital A, assuming for a moment that it doesn't give free
care to indigents on a broad scale, let's say it dropped its
emergency room completely for, let's say, the particular
example that it might be engaged in treating cancer patients
or a particular kind of disease.

Under those circumstances

an emergency room would be superfluous because such a hospital
would rarely have need for an emergency room.

Or, for example

a consortium of hospitals in a particular community could get
together and one could say, "We will have the emergency room,
you have the nursing school, and a third" —

MR. SMITH:

Well, then, they go together.
Yes.

Yes, they do.

Thank you.
Now, given the fact that this ruling that

27
is under challenge here just presents these two hypothetical
polar examples, I think it's important to point out that if
a particular hospital decided that it didn't need an emergency
room for a particular reason because of its own mode of
operation/ it would not necessarily have been denied a tax
exemption by the Internal Revenue Service, and that to us
demonstrates the hypothetical quality of this suit, because
this ruling came up or was published on an abbreviated set of
facts.

Hospital A, indeed no other hospital is before this

Court to present its own set of facts.

And indeed eech

hospital continues to remain free to litigate its owr right
to exemption on its own facts.
QUESTION:

No hospitals were parties to this action

at all.
MR. SMITE:

No hospitals were parties to this action

at all, Mr. Justice Rohnquist.

And to us this demonstrates

an important point.
QUESTION:

Did th® Government ever move to dismiss

the action on the basis of failure to join indispensable
parties?
MR. SMITH:

Wo don't regard the hospital as an

indispensable party within the technical meaning of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Why don't you?
Well, simply because —

Well, I think

28
that if a hospital had been joined as a party, then X think
we would essentially be faced here with whether that particular
hospital exemption should continue to stand or not.
I think the important thing —
QUESTION:

Isn't the only person that gets hurt is

the hospital?
MR. SMITH:

The only person that might get hurt —

the only entity that might get hurt is the hospital.
QUESTION:

And that doesn't make them an indispensable

party?
MR. SMITH:

It makes them an indispensable party,

but the joinder of one, two, three, or indeed a dozen hospitals
would not create a broad rule which would be applicable to
the hospitals generally, because each hospital continues to
remain free to litigate its own right to an exemption on its
own particular facts.

And to us that demonstrates that this

suit really is tantamount to asking the Federal court to render
an advisory opinion, because if a Federal court says the
emergency room requirement is no good, reinstate the old ruling,
what essentially we are left with is a pronouncement which has
no pertinence to any particular hospital.
QUESTION:

You ar© saying it is not a case of

controversy.
MR. SMITH:

Essentially it is not a concrete case

which warrants a decision by a Federal court.

29
QUESTION:

What motions did you file?

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

What did you say?
What motions did you file?

MR. SMITH:

We filed a motion — essentially the

position that we advance here was advanced in the lower courts.
We moved to dismiss —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

For what reason?
— for a lack of standing, for failure

to state a causa of action, that this suit comes within the tax
exception

of the Declaratory Judgment Act, it's not appropriate

for judicial resolution.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

So you filed motions to dismiss.
Yes, and the district court deried the

motion to dismiss.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Then you filed a motion for judgment.
Yes.

And the district court —

essentially th® district court decided that it had jurisdiction.
held the ruling invalid, and granted broad declaratory relief
that th© plaintiff seeks.
Th® Court of Appeals held that the Federal court had
jurisdiction but held the ruling to be valid.
QUESTION:

Supposing the district court hac been

affirmed by th® Court of Appeals, would that have hac.
financial consequences to hospitals?
MR. SMITH:

It may have had financial consequences to

30
some hospitals, but it's entirely unclear as to how many, if
any, hospitals would have suffered detriment.
The point is that each hospital continues to remain
free to litigate its own right to a tax exemption.

Indeed,

Hospital A in this case, as the ruling demonstrates, was
involved in education and research activities.

It may well be

that if it decided to drop its emergency room, as I have said,
for one reason or another, because it was inappropriate to
its activities, it still would have had a right to an exemption
and it could have pressed its case before the Commissioner,
before a Federal court, either the tax court or a district
court.
QUESTION:

So from the indispensable party's point

of view, the only answer would have been to have joined every
single hospital that pays taxes in the country.
-.4

MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

_ ’

’

And that io us demonstrates,

you know, th© hypothetical abstract quality of this suit.
It doesn't attempt to solve anything of general import.

A

revenue ruling doesn't attempt to solve anything of general
import.

It simply is a published statement on abbreviated

facts of the Internal Revenue Service boiled down which attempts
to educate the public about general Internal Revenue Service
positions.
Now, I think th© point about joining every hospital
in the country is important, because essentially Congress has

31
determined that the tax jurisdiction of the Federal courts
limited to deficiency suits and refund suits.

is

And the reason

for that essentially is because the courts cannot decide
cases, much less tax cases, on anything but a full presentation
of all the facts.

Here we have an abbreviated set of facts,

and essentially for a court to render judgment about Hospital A
and other similarly situated hospitals may not affect very
many, if any* hospitals at all.
QUESTION:

Hr. Smith, one thing that is not clear

to me, if this letter is daclared out, what does it change, if
anything?
MR. SMITH:

If this letter is declared out- it

changes —
QUESTION:

What would it change?

It wouldn’t change

«mything.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

It wouldn’t change anything.
Would it?
It wouldn’t change ths tax liability of

any hospital.
QUESTION:

I suppose that's why you sure saying

no judgment should have baen entered in the first placa.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

Exactly.

This is really a

request for an abstract decision on an abstract set of facts.
QUESTION:

But if it turns on your answer to Mr.

Justice Marshall’s question, then if the ruling would have

32
changed the liability of some hospital, would your answer
then be different?
HR. SMITH:

No.

My answer wouldn't be different

simply because, as we point out at great length in our brief,
we don' t think that the Internal Revenue Code conferet a private
right of action on nontaxpayers to contest the tax liability
of any particular person.

And I think that's important here

because I think essentially that's what's lurking behind this
suit.

Th© plaintiffs have said that this suit essentially

simply involves th® editing and rewriting of a revenue ruling
of general application, and they trust the system to alter
hospital conduct.
Now, taking that at face value, I think that th®
simple answer to that is that really makes this an abstract
case simply because of the Internal — if they are not
interested in Internal Revenue enforcement with respeact to any
particular hospital or group of hospitals, then essentially
they arts asking th© Federal courts to rewrite revenues rulings,
which is the province of the Commissioner, where there may be
no effect at all, or they proffer no interest in it in effect.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't let them into any suit at

any stage with respect to whether a hospital was exempt or not.

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's right.

W© don't think —

So that this particular group or poor

people generally who would like free service cannot litigate

33
as far as you are concerned the exemption or nonexemption of
hospitals.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly, any more than A cannot litigate

the propriety of a ruling given to B, if

he doesn't like B,

if he thinks B is a competitor of his, if he thinks that for
one abstract reason or another the ruling was incorrect.

The

Internal Revenue Code simply doesn't confer private rights of
action on citizens generally to challenge the tax consequences
that the Infernal Revenue Service has conferred on a private
party.

I think that's absolutely well settled.

there is a decision which is in point on this

I think if
of this Court,

it seems to us it's Louisiana v. McAdoo, which the plaintiffs
here have dismissed as overruled.
overruled.

That decision hasn't been

Thera the State of Louisiana, which was itself

engaged in the production of sugar, filed a motion for leave
to file a bill of complaint in this Gourt in an original action
to force th® Secretary of th© Treasury to increase the quotas,
m

tha duties on imported sugar.

It, as a producer of domestic

sugar, felt hampered and those rulings operated to its financial
detriment.

And the Court simply said that that kind of

action — it dismissed it without considering the merits —
would operate to disturb the whole revenue system of the
Government, and that court's role in such a case would be to
interfere with th® very function of Government.
Another decision which we think is virtually oh point.

34
is the Dorsheimer case which was rendered by this Court over —
QUESTION:

Can any person that you know of challenge

an exemption letter?

I am sure if you cancel one the fellow

whose letter is cancelled can litigate with you, but how about
the other way?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No.
So that if you ware granted an exemption

letter, whether it conforms to the statute or not, you are
home free.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Justice Whit® —
Yes or no.

MR. SMITH:

Has ha got it?

The answer is yes, but that has been a

decision of Congress to confer the power to administer the
tax laws in the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
QUESTION:

Some Congressman becomes awar® of this

and gets aacitod enough, he could embark on some kind of fin
investigation and inquiry, couldn't he?
MR. SMITH:

Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, a simple

letter to th© Internal Revenue Service, I have found,by a
Member of Congress, elicits a very prompt response.
QUESTION:

And if it doesn't, they can go on with

congressional inquiry.
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely.

And tJ-ay can enacu legisla­

tion, and if particular public officials have acted in a way
that th© Congress thinks is improper, Congress can soak to call

35
him before investigating consaittaes.
QUESTION:
■ .f.

Indeed, recent —

They do that sometimes, don't they?
.

MR. SMITH:

,

They do that.

In fact, the present

incumbent Commissioner of Internal Revenue has been before
Congress some 29 times in the last year.

Congress has

exhibited a very detailed interest in both substantive tax
law and in the administration of the revenue

laws.

It seems to us there are just some things that the
courts don't get into, and one of them is the administration
of the tax laws as the Commissioner sees fit.

This to us

dates back to the Second Congress when in 1792 Congress
enacted a provision saying that the Secretary of the Treasury
shall direct tiis collection of taxes, which were then internal
taxes, as he shall judge? b$st.

And the present Code follows

through on that, grants a number of wide* discretionary powers
to the Secretary of the Treasury end hie delegate, til©
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to publish rules, nake
assessments, bring civil actions.

And that authority is

explicitly and solely conferred in these public officials.
The Internal Revenue Code doesn't confer any private rights of
action in thosa cases.
Dorehoimer

And, indeed, as I was saying, the

case it seems to us is another case which a

hundred years ago this Court was faced with a situation where
a collector of Internal Revenue and two informants brought a
suit abainst the United States urging that the Secretary of

36

the Treasury improperly waived the penalty in a particular
liquor tax violation case.

And they were indeed hurt because

at that time they had an existing right to part of the
proceeds of the penalty.

They felt the penalty should have

been enforced and they would have gotten more money.
QUESTION:

The Dorsheimer case would go off on

standing or on lack of case or controversy?
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is very hard to

know how that case went off.

The court simply said with

respect to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury,
it was the exercise of his discretion in a matter entrusted to
him alone and from which there could be no appeal.

I suppose

the court said that there really wasn’t the case for the court
to considor.

This was something that Congress had given this

public official sol© discretion to do, and you can't appeal
from that sort of thing.

And today, the Internal Revenue Code

provides for discretion of th® Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to settle cases.

If a case is settled and some other

party doesn't like the way it was settled, there is no
causa of action to com® into the Federal courts.
QUESTION:

Like ha could audit somebody and alloy;

a depreciation deduction
MR. SMITH:

and nobody can really challenge it.

Exactly.

Exactly.

And it seems" to us

that Congress has made a decision that these particular

public

officials — they may make mistakes from time to time, but

37
the presumption is that they are operating clearly in accordance
to their best lights.

The tax law is hard, but the Internal

Revenue Service is staffed by people who have a good deal of
expertise in this matter, and the courts are not going to
second guess them in this context.
QUESTION:

These rulings are subject, are they not,

at any time to revocation?
HR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Of course.
Even when revocation may affect a given

taxpayer?
HR. SMITH:

Indeed.

The Internal Revenue Service

reserves ths right to revoke something retroactively, and he
generally only does it when there is an omission of material
facta, but ha can do it, and this Court in Dixon and American
Automobile Association has said that he c.*an do it.

And, Mr.

Justice Brennan, that brings up another point about —
QUESTION:

That can bo tested in the charitable case

by the contributor, can't it?
MR. SMITH:

That can b© tested, yes, as ths Court

has indicated in Bob Jones.
QUESTION:

But in the other case where a gay is, or

some corporation or foundation is violating its exemption,
nobody can do anything about that but the Commissioner.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

Of course, the public has the

right to bring the matter to ths attention of ths Commissioner.

38
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

But no legal action can reach It.
Absolutely.

In the same way,that as

we point out in our brief, if somebody feels somebody is
involved in an unfair labor practice and contacts tha
general counsel of the Labor Board and he disagrees, that’s the
end of the matter.

He can't sue to compel the general counsel

of the Labor Board or the Federal Trade Commission or many
other agencies and ask them to commence proceedings against
private parties.

Congress has vested discretion in the officials

alone to enforce those statutes.
I want to mention on© other thing sort of as a
concomitant to

my discussion with Mr. Justice Brennan,

and that is the difficulties engendered by these kind of
injunctive* actions in this case are illustrated by whet
happened after the district court's judgment came down.

of cours©, ths Governmant appealed.

Then,

Of course, during that

time there ware many hospitals who were anxious to have their
tax status clarified, contributors who were anxious to have
their deductions clarified, municipal bond issues were pending
as to whether hospitals were tax exempt.

Th© Government

applied for a stay to the district court of its decision in
Order to allow at least until th© matter was resolved
throughout the courts to have its policy continued to be extant.

39

The district court denied the stay, the Court of Appeals denied
the stay.

Essentially for six or eight months the matter

was in complete limbo.

The Commissioner had no idea how to

enforce the law at all.

And it seems to us that really

demonstrates how these injunctive actions undermine the whole
very salutary nature of the published revenue ruling program
which is to educate the public.

If the public is in disarray,

it doesn't know what the answer is going to be, and the ■
Commissioner is stymied by court orders, in a normal case
