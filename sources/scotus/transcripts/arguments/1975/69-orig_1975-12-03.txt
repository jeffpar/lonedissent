MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear

arguments

next in Mo. 69 Original, States of Maine, Massachusetts, and
Vermont against New Hampshire.
General Brennan, you have had the benefit of the
arguments that have just been completed, and of course we
have had the benefit of them.

So, we fake it that you will

pick up where they left off and give us something that you
have not heard this morning and 'this afternoon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH E. BRENNAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF STATES
MR. BRENNAN:

Mr. Justice, sir, may it please the

Court:
We will certainly try to.

Much of our thunder

frankly has been stolen in many respects.
The facts in this ca.se really are not in disputes.
The action of the plaintiff states is in their sovereign and
proprietary capacities to recover funds diverted by the
unconstitutional New Hampshire income tax.
imposed in 1970.

This tax. was

It was challenged in 1971 by Maine citizens

with strong support from the State of Maine.

It was held

unconstitutional in March as violative of the privileges and
immunities clause.
As we see

it, the essential and ultimate question

is whether or not New Hampshire should benefit from such

4
unconstitutional conduct with this unconstitutional tax scheme
by retaining the proceeds of that scheme, which amount to
some $13-1/2 million which were diverted from the plaintiffs8
treasury.
parties.

We say that the plaintiffs are the appropriate
We say they were hurt, as was intended by the State

of Mew Hampshire.
For the individual taxpayers to bring an action,
assuming they could get over standing issue, assuming they
could show some injury, would be, as has bean said earlier,
repetitious? it would be costly.

Any damages that were awardee

would have to be turned over to the plaintiff states.

So,

there would b® absolutely no incentive for them t© do it.
Q

Would a class action be available to them?

MR. BRENNAN:

I think a class action might be

avail.ab.te, but again they would run into the same problem with
standing.

That class would not be hurt.

hurt is Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont.
burden.

The party that is
They bore the

Their treasuries did not receive money they would

otherwise have received had not been for this unconstitutional
tax.
Q

Is there any way they could have avoided that

along the lines Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested in a question?
MR. BRENNANt

In reference to the possibility of

retaliation, the cases of this Court have emphasised several
times and as recently as Austin against the policy of

5
retaliation.
Q

Other than retaliation.

MR. BRENNAN:

There is no other way that 1 am aware

off Mr. Chief Justice.

Q

Could you not change your law?

MR. BRENNAN;

If we were to change our law, that

would mean to amend the law not to give the tax credit.

That

in effect would he retaliation against our residents who
work in New Hampshire, and we then would not be retaliating
against our reeldents who may have worked in 39 other states
where we give tax credits.
Q

If you did not have your law in the first place

you would not ha here today.
and I was alone.

I am just arguing my dissent,

So, do not ba concerned by it.

MR. BRENNAN;

We submit that the states here are not

stand-ins for the individual taxpayers, that they are suing
in their own right, that under Article III, Section 2 of the
Constitution, that the Supreme Court is the proper forum,
that 'this section con temp ated ‘that one state should not be
compelled t© go into the jurisdiction of another state to seek
a solution.

Therefore, the New Hampshire courts or administra

fcive agencies are not the appropriate forum.

And in

reference to that retaliation, we feel that the decisions are
clear, that the policy is against if, that the State of Maine
should not try to visit

double sins on its own taxpayers

6
just to retaliate for what was apparently going to be a shortlived illegal tax scheme.
The fact that the plaintiff states did not retaliate,
it is suggested by New Hampshire that we should be barred.
We submit that that type of argument really does not wash.
In Texas v, Florida? 306 US, where one state
threatens to deprive the other of its lawful taxes, this
creatas an appropriate basis for action by this Court.
In essence we are saying—and much of it is

just

reiterating what has been said before—we are the real party
in interest.

We have been hurt.

The individual taxpayers

really would not hurt to any major degree.

And if they did
i

recover, they would have to turn the money over to us.
again, this is an action between states.

And

This is the

appropriate forum.
Any recovery the individuals got would be a nullity.
The plaintiff ct-j.bss could not have avoided it without risking
violating the privileges and immunities clause themselves or
the equal protection clause.
Q

Why would any recovery' the individuals got be

a nullity?
MR, BRENNAN:

Then their tax returns would have to

be amended to reflect that there was no payment to another
state.

So then the payments would have to be made to Maine,

Massachusetts, and Vermont.

7
Q

Is all that quite as clear as you make it

sound?
MR. BRENNAN:
Q

Do you need an injunction?

MR. BRENNAN:
accounting.
Q

I believe it is, Mr. Justice.

We need an injunction to get an

W@ need an injunction because—
Do you need an injunction to force Now

Hampshire not to enforce its tax?
MR. BRENNAN:

They could do it on their own.

But

at present, they sent out a notice right after this—
Q

What was the result of Austin?

MR. BRENNAN:

The result of Austin was they instructe3

the employers in their stats to step withholding taxes after
March 19th.

However, they instructed those people to continue

to make payments for money that was collected prior t©
March 19th.
Q

But as far as the future is concerned, the harm

to Maine will not occur again?
MR. BRENNAN:
was collected prior

Just to the extent that the money that

to Austin, they are going to require

returns to be made next year, as I understand it, on monies
that are characterised already as unconstitutionally taken
from our citizens.
Q
March I9th.

I gather that would be as to earnings up to

8
MR. BRENNAN:

Correct, Mr. Justice.,

To refuse t© allow us t© file a complaint based on
these facts would encourage petty retaliatory reaction in the
future.

It would encourage states to adopt tax laws of

dubious legality in the knowledge that they may be able to
return their ill-gotten gains.
On the other hand, to accept this complaint would
further the policies of non-retaliation long articulated by
this Court.

It would place the states on r otice that they

must develop their taxing schemes with great care.
Finally, the Court should not adopt a rule which
might encourage some states beset by immediate fiscal crisis
to give less than careful care in adopting tax laws which
may be unconstitutional.

We would urge you very respectfully

to permit the plaintiff states to file a complaint.
Mr. Scotch from Vermont has the other 15 minutes.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Scotch.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENSON D. SCOTCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF STATES
MR. SCOTCH:

Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please

the Court:
I com© her© to talk about the seriousness and the
dignity of the complaint of the three plaintiff states against
the State of New Hampshire.

I originally had planned before

9
hearing the earlier argument to dwell principally on the
question of retroactivity, for I think no other question
raises the equities between the plaintiff states and New
Hampshire better than the question of retroactivity.
In approaching this particular equities question,
it seems to me we fall back immediately on this Court’s own
declarations in retroactivity cases.

I think it is important

to note that at the time New Hampshire adopted its
commuters' income tax, one against Maryland had been decided
by some 90 years previous.
Some 56 years ago in this very room Travis was
argued *

Since that time—Q

This room has only been here for about 40 years.

[Laughter]
MR. SCOTCH:
Q

In this building, Your Honor.

No, the building has only been here for about—

MR. SCOTCH:

The point is that as far as tha case is

concerned, certainly New Hampshire knew what they were doing.
The books have not changed.

The buildings may have.

There

has been virtually nothing since Travis and the date of the
adoption of the commuters

income tax that would have given

any suggestion to New Hampshire that that tax could have been
constitutional.

I think this is very vital.

In the second Lemon v„ Kurtrman case, this Court
raised the question of whether decisions of the Court that

10

are of first impression f that declare new principles of law
should be retroactively applied.

I submit that at the time

the commuters indome tax was adopted, certainly no case of
first impression or any impression had been decided by this
Court or even submitted to this Court that would have given
them any comfort in the adoption of their commuters income
tax case.
Very important in the question of retroactivity and
in the question of equities is the subject of reliance.

I

think it is inherent in a number of the questions that the
Justices have presented both in the earlier argument and in
this argument.
Lemon

In the normal reliance situation, when in

v. Kurt2man, the second decision, the Court speaks of fcha

hard facts upon which people rely, people must rely, in making
•their decisions, obviously the Court is speaking of two classes
of people.

One class is the lawgiver; the other class is the

reliance interest.

And in each of the cases that the Court

has decided in the retroactivity area, there has been a
separation or bifurcation of the law-giving interest—either
the legislatures or the courts, on the one hand—and upon
those who rely on the other hand.
Thus, for example, in Lemon v. Kurtzman it was the
non-public schools that were the reliance interest.

Certainly

they did not create the laws in which they had to make their
decisions.

The same thing in Chevron v. Huson or in the

11
frequent criminal retroactivity cases that come

before this

Court, most recently in the Peltier case, obviously the
considerations that apply wars those who were forced to rely
to make their day-to-day judgments cannot make them on tha
basis of shaping their own law? they are put in a bind.
Essentially the retroactivity cases, in mv way of thinking,
*»

«allocate or divide

among two interest parties, both of which

are essentially innocent in so far as being able to frame and
shape the law.
In the case of New Hampshire adopting a commuters
income tax case, we have a very, very different situation.
As will appear in the record--and I will not repeat what is
already in the record—at the time and prior to the time that
New Hampshire adopted this tax, they were on very good
notice from a task force report prepared, for the governor
that there were grave questions about the constitutionality
of the commuters income tax case.
Mr. Harape's opinion, which is also in the record,
point’s out how cleverly the bill is drafted.

It separates

those who might complain but will be unable to complain because
they have no standing, from those who ar»* the real targets,
namely, the states.
I would submit to this Court that it appears clear
from the legislative history of this act that if the three
surrounding states did not have tax credits, the commuters

12
income tax of New Hampshire would have never been adopted»
The most important retroactivity-equities question
that I think the Court ought to consider

and that I want to

address is the proposition raised by this Court in Linkletter.
Will the rule whose retroactive application is sought tend
to further or retard the effectiveness of the rule?

And I

would submit in this case the Court essentially is balancing
for legitimate interests--and we concede that they are
legitimate interests--on the part of the states to experiment
with neitf types of taxation that fit new social and political
and economic conditions within the country, balance that
interest on the one hand with what I think is an equally
serious interest,, to deter what we refer to in our brief as
predatory taxation or tax adventurism or the like»

It is

very, very important, we feel, to consider those interests
as being very equal interests and to try to develop policies
that will mediate between those interests»
I would submit, that if a state acts with full
knowledge of the consequences and with full knowledge of the
potential impediments in a statute, and if that state later is
not compelled to face the consequences of what it has done,
then I would see no reason why any state should not adopt
borderline legislation or perhaps legislation that goes well
over the border-.

There are no sanctions»

It takes three or

possibly five yeara for these cases to wild their way through

13

the courts»
Q

There would be no sanction whatsoever»
Should we take all cases that take three to

five years before they could get here?
MR. SCOTCH:
Q

No, Your Honor.

Is that a very good reason for our exercising

original jurisdiction?
MR. SCOTCH:

In our case, as distinguished from the

previous case ws heard today, Your Honor, this tax already has
been declared invalid by this Court.

This is not the

situation that I think Pennsylvania, if I may allude to their
argument, tried to suggest would develop if the Court took
jurisdiction of this case.
It is not a vcsry common situation where a legislative
history has developed reflecting a direct intent to act
against the treasury of a sister state and where indeed the
legislative history indicates that unless the tax laws of the
second state were not susceptible to this treatment, the tax
would not be adopted at all.

I think this would not be a

largo case finding decision in that sense.
Q

But that is a part, presumably, of the law of

the interstate commerce clause, and you say that you have got
a very strong case here under that because of that fact.
if we start taking those cases, we are going to have to
entertain arguments that are presumably a good deal less
persuasive than yours once we let the cases in the Court.

But

14
MR. SCOTCH:

I would simply urge, Mr. Justice

?

Relinquish, that in the case of the three plaintiff states
here represented we did not come directly to the Court.

We

bided our time in Austin v. New Hampshire, and it was a long
time and a costly time.
Q

Did you finance any of that litigation?

MR. SCOTCH:
ye, we did.

We appeared as an amicus curiae, and

We participated directly.

Wo felt that was the

proper rout© to go, not alone in terms of the limited
original jurisdiction of this Court but in tersus of giving
New Hampshire the opportunity through their court system or
through their legislators to recant, and they did not do so.
We feel at this point, with the tax having been
declared unconstitutional, this is not a case finding
decision.

This is a very unusual set of circumstances, and

we feel that we have gone to court in the right order, starting'
with the state where we ought, to have started, and in that sensa
is not comparable at all to the condition of the suit by
Pennsylvania against New Jersey, not to cast any suggestion
about the merits of their original action.

But we felt

differently at the time and we so conducted ourselves.
I want to address -myself to a point that has been
raised in several connections by th® Justices, and that is the
so-called mitigation question.
have repealed -their credits?

Why should not the states
I want to draw a clear

15

distinction between cases like Massachusetts v. Missouri or
Texas \~o Florida where we are dealing with death taxes.

The

income tax credit is not only a fact of life today virtually
throughout the country but in this particular instance our
failure to grant the credit would have meant effective
double taxation to our own citizens.

And 1 would simply urge

that in the economic realities of an income tax, particularly
in today's economic conditions where wages in our particular
part of the country are not high, doubling the income tax of
our own citizens in order to redress the wrongs committed by
New Hampshire did not come to us as a really viable alternative.
Q
of the tax.

Mr. Scotch, 1 do not. follow you on the doubling
I thought that New Hampshire had a credit.

An I

in error as to ‘that?
MR. SCOTCH:

I believe they have a credit for their

own citizens, but 1 believe the outcome, as conceded earlier
in arguments where Pennsylvarir. ntdt reference to the possible
double taxation suggests, and together with New Hampshire's
own brief in this matter, suggests that there would be no
falling away of the New Hampshire fax in the event that we
dropped our credit..

All that would fall away is an entirely

hypothetical tax that was imposed upon citizens of New Hampshire
'who worked in Vermont and the other two states that never could
be applied because of the way it was drafted.

But it is my

understanding that our dropping of our tax credit would

16
directly involve double taxation unless of course, as suggested
by the Court in the earlier argument, unless of course New
Hampshire chose at that point to drop its commuters income tax,
that is a completely speculative matter»
Q

Really your distinction between death taxes

double and income taxes double really boils down to nothing
more than the idcsa that dead people cannot vote, does it not?
MR. SCOTCH;

No, Your Honor»

Even in the area of

death taxes we found out in Texas v, Florida, where th© rival
claims are mutually exclusive, this Court will take jurisdic­
tion.

All I am suggesting is that—
Q

Was not the real reason in Texas v. Florida

that the combined asserted tax by all the states exceeded
the st at®—MR. SCOTCH;

That is right.

They were mutually

exclusive.
Q

—and finally this Court took jurisdiction?

MR. SCOTCH;
Q

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

That is a long slow road even there.

ME. SCOTCH;

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

What I ami

suggesting in answer to the argument Valenti non fit injuria
is that we as a states need to consider the injuria.

What or

what kind of injury are v?e visiting upon our own citizens?
Must we be compelled to take the corrective steps where there
has been harm, deliberate harm, as will appear in the

17

statutory history of this act?
1 think, talking of old common law doctrine, that
it was clear common law doctrine that mitigation of damages
need not be taken where the mitigation itself would be
unreasonable or would cause undue harm to others,

in fact,

I think old common law cases going back to the 17th century
make clear the right, for example, of the lord of the manor
to defend the servant.

And I would suggest an equal prcposi-

tion in our case, that the states have not only the right to
defend their citizens and the ability of a citizen to continue
to work but probably a duty to do so.

I would submit that it

would have been a number of years before Hew Hampshire could
have practically considered the repeal of its commuters income
tax.
Talking of our own proprietary interests, I think it
would be demonstrable, if a master is appointed in this case,
to show that the incomes of many of our commuters are at such
a level that the doubling of their income

taxation would

make it economically inconsequential for them to continue
working.

Many of our people—
Q

I guess my problem, and I will not repeat it

anymore, is that I fail to see the doubling of the t&y., and
it certainly was not true in Austin v. Hew Hampshire.
MR. SCOTCH:

I believe--and of course this is a

matter we can submit further written documents on—1 believe

18
the tax is written in such a way that the benefit so-called
of our dropping our credit would not accrue to our own
citizens -

That is a technical matter.

T believe we are right

on it, and we will leave it to New Hampshire perhaps to declare
whether that is correct or not.
Q

I guess my difficulty basically is to conclude

that New Hampshire is such a rascal in all this.
MR. SCOTCH:

We in Vermont of course have our own

very strong views on New Hampshire, Your Honor.
Q

This is nothing new.

MR., SCOTCH:

I would like finally, if I may, to

address & remark or two about Massachusetts v. Missouri.

X

find there is a very expansive if not a profligate reliance
upon Massachusetts v. Missouri.
as 1 read th® case.

That was a very simple case

All the Court is saying in Massachusetts

v. Missouri is that Massachusetts has not stated a cause of
action.

This was a case of rival but allegedly mutually

exclusive claims.

They turned out not to be mutually

exclusive.
There was no allegation in Massachusetts' papers
in Massachusetts y. Missouri that the Missouri tax is dis­
criminatory' or that in any way the tax violated any precept
of the United States Constitution.
In their papers before this Court—in fact, 'the sole
allegation that Attorney General Deever really is able to level

19

in Massachusetts y, Missouri is that the courts of Missouri
will not hear Massachusetts' claim against the trustees of
the trust»

The attorney general of Missouri was able to give

that the lie by sstating in open court that of course the
courts of Missouri would hear a claim by Massachusetts against
th© trustees, and -that is all that Massachusetts v,. Missouri
decides»

We are not claiming mutual exclusivity»

We are

claiming in effect a direct harm to the interests of our state
a calculated harm, and, if you will, a harm that in terms of
common law analogies is very similar to a direct common law
tort, although we have not so alleged»

Perhaps that states

th© cars© a little strongly.
There is nothing that we can find in the Common­
wealth of Massachusetts against Missouri that would lend the
general proposition that tax cases that are otherwise
justiciable may not come before this Court in original
jurisdiction.

It seams to ms, if we make out a claim that

the three plaintiff states were in fact the targets, perhaps
some of these questions go to fact finding that could occur
after a master is appointed.

But we feel frankly they are

adequately stated on the record submitted with our papers.
We feel very strongly that on that typ© of theory, not a
mutually exclusive theory, there is no reason why this Court
ought not to on general principles of equity and common law
take original jurisdiction of this case in the manner in

20

which water diversion cases or pollution casas are taken.

For,

in that sens®, when we consider direct injury, there really is
very little distinction between those classes ©f cases.
Q

Mr. Scotch, it may not become relevant, but if

this case proceeded as you would like to have it proceed and a
special master were appointed, a jury were requested, as was
fairly common 175 years ago, from whence would the jurors be
drawn?
MR. SCOTCH:
Q

Well, Your Honor—

Perhaps we do not need to dwell on it.

I thought

you might have a ready answer for that.
MR. SCOTCH;

Our answer would be we would hope not

from the State of New Hampshire *

We would certainly so argue.

ILaughter 3
Q

I assumed that.

MR. SCOTCH:

We would

also of course rely upon the

ability of the Court, as demonstrated time and again, to
exercise what is inherently an equity jurisdiction.

And of

course we would argue that as an equitable matter a jury
would be inappropriate.
Q

Have you read Curtis v. Lother two years ago

where we said that if you are going to award damages, you
must have a jury in the federal system?
»

MR. SCOTCH;

Our answer in that question, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, would be that 1 believe where a jury is called, the

21

question of liability is at issue.

What we would argue in

reply to that is that the question of liability, the question
of the constitutionality of the tax at any rate, is a question
which has already been disposed of by this Court.
left to do is add up the bill.

All that is

How much in fact has New

Hampshire diverted, assuming arguendo that our diversion
argument will prevail?
I would submit to this Court that on the narrow
question of adding up the tally and perhaps adding up the
interest which we hope also will be added, that it is not
only inappropriate to require a jury but that the jury would
essentially—
Q

That is not traditional damages.

That is more

of an accounting type.
MR. SCOTCH:

And that again, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

reinforces the fact that essentially we are invoking your
equity jurisdiction.

The basic question of liability in our

view already has been determined by this Court in a prior
proceeding and a proceeding which, from our point of view,
was the proper one to have brought and in.which we participated
I would like, if I might, in my remaining time to
refer to an issue that was raised in the other argument that
is not explicitly raised by New Hampshire but I think as a
penumbra! matter may certainly be brought up in connection
with our case.

And that is the question of whether the

22

individuals would be necessary parties if this Court were
to take jurisdiction.

.And I would like to suggest an answer

to that, that all three states have maintained their rights
against their individual taxpayers and that if following our
successful prosecution of this case in original

jurisdiction

any taxpayer of the State of Vermont would appear in a New
Hampshire court claiming the same types of damages, our answer
would be---and although it would be inappropriate for us fco
appear as parties, we ceetainly would apply to appear as
amicus—our approach would be in that case to suggest, to the
trial court in New Hampshire that no claim remains.

Any

recovery that might be garnered by a citizen of Vermont in
a court of New Hampshire would be matched by a contrary claim
by Vermont against that citizen, based upon a revocation of
the credit.

Of course, that is a moot issue if w© have already

received that credit money directly back from New Hampshire.
I guess in short the answer would be no claim
remains after our successful prosecution of this case in this
Court.
Q

'Sven though under your submission a Vermont

commuter into New Hampshire was •unconstitutionally required
to pay taxes by New Hampshire?
MR. SCOTCH;
absque injuria.
Q

That would be, Your Honor, damnum

There has been no harm.
le sure thinks there is harm, I would imagine.

23

MR. SCOTCH:

Not if he has been given full credit

by the States of Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts.

He may have

been harmed initially, but certainly any money that he would
recover would be double recovery for him.

If he gets another payment from New

has been doubly enriched.

Hampshire, he

We certainly would not tolerate

that, and we would state in court, that we would appear in New
Hampshire in some appropriate forum to borrow that claim.

We

just do not think that is a viable possibility in the courts
of New Hampshire.
In cor.cusion I simply would say that although we
recognise the fierce independent spirit that seems to be
apparent today, particularly in our region of the country,
that spirit ought to be guided under the mantle of the
Constitution and not contrary to it or ©round it, that the
main point I would like to leave with the Court is this is not
an appropriate case to look at the intention of the legisla­
ture to see if any intentional wrong, intentional harm, was
meant at fch© time they adopted their statute and in fact
effectuated.

Then I cannot imagine any such case ever being

brought to this Court.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Cleaveland.

Thank you, Mr. Scotch.

I am sure you will agree that you

will not need to repeat any of the arguments that your friend

from New Jersey made on behalf of the State of New Jersey»
ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHARLES G» CLEAVE LAND, ESQ,,,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEPENDANT STATE
MR» CLEAVEland;

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would have to confess that with ’the arguments that
have gone before me, I am certainly in a position of being
last.

I hop® that X shall not be found to be least»

But to

pass up any discussion whatsoever of the facts of the case,
•the way the case arose, which X think is very familiar to the
Court, X had intended to outline the fundamental basis of our
objection to this motion for leave to file, which is that this
Court must in any such case find a basis upon an actual
controversy in order to allow the original juridiction of this
Court to be invoked.
We insist that there is no such controversy presentee
upon the complaint sought to bo filed.

The basis upon which

we say that is the case is that in the cases of Texas v. Florida,
Massachusetts v, Missouri, a standard was set out in which the
plaintiff, a plaintiff state, seeking to invoke original
jurisdiction must have suffered wrong through the action of
the defendant stats, furnishing ground for judicial redress
or that the plaintiff must foe asserting the right against
the defendant state susceptible of enforcement.
The facts alleged in this complaint demonstrate

25

neither an injury in fact to the plaintiff sovereign states
nor that the circumstance which they assign as an injury is in
any way caused by an action of the state of Hew Hampshire.
If I may illustrate, if the injury

assigned is the

loss of tax revenue, the complaint fails to show that Hew
Hampshire is the cause of it since the immediate cause of the
plaintiffs5 failure to collect the funds is in their own
credit provisions by which they waive the collection of those
funds voluntarily and within their own unfettered discretion.
The first requirement of a justiciable controversy
between the states--namely that of an injury caused by the
plaintiff state-—was applied in the case of Massachusetts v,
Missouri, and the Court held there that sine© the plaintiff
had full constitutional power to tax, the subject matter, no
intransigence of the defendant state Missouri , whether in the
form of improper legislation or capricious administration of
proper legislation would result in an injury to the plaintiff.
Simply put, the Court said, ’’Look, Missouri has a
statute on the books which Massachusetts thinks ought to be
construed so as to allow Massachusetts the unfettered right
to tax."

The Court said, "Okay, if that is what Massachusetts

thinks, let them go into-Missouri and challenge the State of
Missouri to prove that to its court."

The problem there was

that Missouri seemed to be inclined to administer its statute
in a way which Massachusetts could not agree with.

The probieir

26

there was that this Court found that either state could
proceed in an exhaustive manner to assert and collect the tax
that it felt to be due under its own statute.
That is still the situation in this case.

If the

plaintiff states think that they are entitled to the money,,
•they have unfettered power to collect it, and they had that
power since the beginning of the cause in question.
Q

What would be the case under the present New

Hampshire statute if Mains did not give it credit for the New
Hampshire tax?

Would under your present law you continue to

collect the tax from people working in New Hampshire but who
are residents of Maine?
“MR. CLEAVELAND:

I believe, sir, you are addressing

the question that cam© up before, and that is, If during the
existence of the New Hampshire tax, Maine had dissolved the
credit, would New Hampshire still assert the tax?
Q

That is not my question.

Onder the law as it was

written, would it have bean collected?
MR. CLEAVELAND;
yes, that is correct.

As th@ law was written, Your Honor,

We do not have entirely a so-called

It was not self-destructing in the sense that if

cleared, it disappeared.
Q

It may be that if Maine eliminated the credit,

maybe New Hampshire

would change its law.

But under the law

as it was written, the tax would still be payable.

27

MR . CLEAVELAND:

That is correct, Your Honor»

the significance of that I think is this-

And

Although it may

b@ said that, that would constitute a grounds for either the
Austin cas© to have proceeded or this case to proceed, I think
in the context of an equity consideration of this case, what
•this shows is that the only thing that the plaintiff states
had to do in order to really throw New Hampshire's case into
a cocked hat back in 1970 was to repeal that credit»
Q

Why would that have done that?

MR. CLEAVELANDs

Keep in mind, sir, that the New

Hampshire court rendered its decision

upon a finding of no

That was the only thing they

They did accept the jurisdiction of the cas® on a

theory that they would allow standing to any taxpayer to raise
just about any question at all, but they did find that they
were not entitled really to raise a constitutional issue
because they were not injured.
Q

But repealing the credit would not have knocked

the New Hampshire tax into a cocked hat.
MR. CLEAVELANDj
the court.

I think it would, Your Honor, in

What I am saying is that as the case would have

appeared in the New Hampshire Supreme Court—
Q

Yes, but as far as New Hampshire, you are just

saying that it would have been declared illegal.
MR. CLEAVELAND:

The possibility is very real, Your

28
Honor.

I think it is something which has to
Q

b

considered.

But New Hampshire did not recognize that fact

by any provision in its law that said that their tax is
contingent upon another state granting it credit.
MR. CLEAVELANDs

That is correct, Your Honor,,

I

think the effect is on® which has to be considered to some
extent a hypothetical, but I think it is a fairly certain
hypothetical, given the way the New Hampshire Supreme Court
decided the case.
In summing up my discussion of Massachusetts v.
Missouri, I think it is very easy to read that case as being
dispositive of this case simply because the analogy is direct.
Here the plaintiffs have the full power to tax irrespective of
the validity of any New Hampshire statute, and their ills are
entirely the product of their own forebearance in the form of
this tax credit.

This Court held in Austin that the validity

of the New Hampshire statute may not turn upon the configuration
of the statutes of another state, namely

,

Maine.

Just so, the power of the plaintiff states to have
wholly prevented their losses and to recoup those losses now
for that matter in no way depends upon the configuration of
New Hampshire statutes.
Q

You say that Maine and the other two states had.

a. right to put a double tax on?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

That is correct, Your Honor.

In

29

Curry v. McCanless, Travis—
Q

You sort of put "right” in quotes, do you not?

MR. CLEAVELAND:

The right?

Yes, X would say that

they have the power* that they have the right X think in the
legal sens® is the same thing.
Q

You mean double taxation is not an automatic

i

indication of unconstitutionality?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

Correct, Your Honor.

What X am

saying is that in th© sense of an equitable consideration of
the plaintiffs' rights now to come back against New Hampshire
to recover the money, the fact that they could have token
action in 1970, which would have literally blown our statute
out of th® water constitutionally

now should be. held against

them with respect to their right to claim—
Q

X still do not understand how you can say

double taxation is perfectly, legal and then say that, if Mains
had repealed its credit in 1970, it would have blown your tax
out of th© water constitutionally.
MR. CLEAVELAND:

From the standpoint of

Mains alone,

X am assuming now that—*let us assume, for instance, the
Shaffer ,ve Carter case.
taxes.

Two states have broad base income

One of them reaches non-residents; the other one

does not.

The one in which the non-residents are reached is

sued on the theory that that is unconstitutional.

The holding

of course is that it is not, even though it results in double

30

taxation and even though the stats in which they reside does
not grant a credit.
Q

I thought you said a while ago New Hampshire

would certainly be entitled to tax income earned within the
state even if Maine taxed it also.
MR. CLEAVELAND;

If both states have constitutional

provisions, Your Honor, double taxation does not present any
automatic constitutional conflict.

The point I am trying to

make is that if Mains had repealed its tax credit or, for that
matter, administratively denied it to persons earning an income
in New Hampshire on the theory that the New Hampshire tax is
not a valid tax, therefor® does not exist, therefore no credit,
either of those two theories, that would have enhanced-—
Q

It would still be up to the tender mercies of

the New Hampshire Supreme Court, would it not?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

If you want to characterize them as

fender mercies, Your Honor, yes, that is true.
Q

I say that to raise a second point.

How does

that prevent them from maintaining 'their action here?
*

MR. CLEAVELAND:

The thing that, prevents them from

maintaining any action here, Your Honor"-'- •
Q

Because as I read the Constitution, it says the

State of Main© doss not have to go to the Supreme Court of New
Hampshire if it has got an argument with the State of New
Hampshire

31

MR. CLEAVELAND:

The question is; whether it actually

has an argument with the State of Hew Hampshire, Your Honor.
The State of Maine was never a taxpayer t© New Hampshire.

The

New Hampshire statute never had any application whatsoever to
the State of Maine as a sovereign? it created no rights on
behalf of the State of Maine, Massachusetts or Vermont and
created n© liabilities upon them.
Q

It simply ignored them.

Is that the essence of your entire position in

this case?
MR. CLEAVELAND:
Q

In a way if is. Your

Honor.

Do you need any better way if you are right on

that?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

I think it is sufficient.

That is

why 1 said, given that finding alone, I think Massachusetts
V. Missouri is dispositive of this case.

X think Mr. Justice

Blackmnn's dissent really comes home in the analysis ©f this
case simply bees,us® any injury that the three states who are
now plaintiffs have sustained is caused, as a matter of
causality, is entirely attributable to the existence of those
tax credits which they were in no wise constitutionally to
maintain.

And

X think in terms of an equitable analysis ©f

the case they should have been involved in this case from the
beginning.
1 noticed my

brother argued that they felt that, the

proper procedure wag to remain in the wings but to in essence

32
take part and aid the Austin plaintiffs in raising their
constitutional question,

If that is so, then where were they

in the context of raising their arguments with respect to
recovery of funds then?
I see a considerable element of the equitable
doctrine of Latches applying hers,

A court of equity, which

this Court has held itself to be when considering original
actions, is very reluctant and should be very reluctant to
award damages to a plaintiff to allow a recovery against a
defendant when the plaintiff has in effect sat on its hands
and allowed the injury to magnify many fold.

That is the

essence of my argument in saying that if they had simply taken
the action in 1970 and had the courage of their convictions
to do so, this case would have had an entirely different
configuration in the Mew Hampshire Supreme Court,.

7md the

analysis and the theory upon which the New Hampshire Supreme
Court held the tax to be valid could not have been made
because it simply was not true as ©. matter of fact.

The New

Hampshire Supreme Court held that there was no substantial
injury in fact.

If Maine had repealed the tax credit, there

clearly would have been.

There would have been double

taxation, and I admitted as much in my argument before this
Court in Austin last spring.
Simply put, we think the claims here are not
mutually exclusive in the sense of Texas v. Florida.

They

33

are rather precisely analogous to that in Mass v, Missouri»
The second basis upon which a controversy can be
maintained here is that there is a right susceptible
judicial enforcement.

of

Assuming for the sake of argument that

the Austin decision creates a right in someone to a money
judgment on the theory that taxes have been collected
improperly,, that supposed right does not inure to the plaintiffs
as sovereign states»

These states were of course not tax­

payers to New Hampshire»

As I said before» the statute in

New Hampshire had nothing to do with the three plaintiff
states here»
The principles upon which the Austin case turn--that
is, the privileges and immunities clause—do not operate for
the benefit of sovereign states since they are not persons
within the meaning of that provision.
If the right asserted here inheres in anyone, it
inheres in the; former taxpayers to New Hampshire who are
citizens of the three plaintiff states.

The state may not hole

forth in this Court in such bulk litigation of private claims

In New Hampshire v. Louisiana,

.Illinois v. Michigan, a long line of cases, this Court has
denied a state the right to litigate
private citizens.

claims on behalf of

In particular in Oklahoma v. Cook the

Court held that a state is barred from litigating claims on
behalf of citizens where the interest of the states arises

34

solely as a result of a statute of the plaintiff state»
Simply put , that means that the Court was saying that a state
may not legislate its way into the original jurisdiction of
this Court,

That# we submit# is what the three plaintiff

states have done in effect with their tax credit provision.
The plaintiffs8 attempted reliance upon the Missouri
v. Illinois and Arizona ?, California lines of cases is mis­
placed, we (suggest.

Firstly# these are uniformly instances

in which the remedy of injunction was appropriate to halt
the action or activity of the defendant state.

That remedy is

simply inappropriate here since.the tax was effectively halted
by the Austin case# which arose through conventional appellate
channels.
Furthermore, the notion of enjoihing state taxation
by application to the federal judiciary is the evil addressed
and eliminated by the federal anti-tax injunction statute.
Any resort to this Court on the theory of Missouri v. Illinois
for an injunction is clearly in contravention of at least the
spirit of that statute if not the substance of it.
I would mention in reply to a contention that the
action taken by New Hampshire was directed at the treasuries
of the three states and not a good faith effort to, if you will,
experiment in valid state taxation, in the first place it .is a
question that comes upon the merits of the case, which is not
before the bar new.

Secondly, it is in large measure an issue

35
of fact which would, if the case is allowed to be filed,
require reference to a master.
hold water.

And, third, it simply does not

As Mr. Justice Blackraim said, he has trouble see­

ing the State of Mew Hampshire as being a rascal in this
situation.

Quite obviously so do 1.
I think the merits of the case are something which

need not be considered now and more appropriately should not
foe considered now because when the question is one of juris™
diction, a lack of jurisdiction is fatal to a case no matter
how strong the case may be on the merits.
The third point I would like to raise is that the
former taxpayers of New Hampshire are necessary parties to this
action.

This issue has been raised .in the prior case and

discussed.

I would like to amplify it only to the point of

saying that th® complaint in this case assumed a very critical
element, and that is that in the change between a recovery
against New Hampshire by a taxpayer, assuming he has the right
on the merits to that recovery, from there to that taxpayer’s
obligation to return that money to his own state on the theory
that a credit was improperly allowed, there is an assumption
that there is a direct equation there.
There ;»s nothing in this complaint which goes to
prove that that assumption is correct.

It. assumes, that the

taxpayers who are also citizens of those three plaintiff states
have no rights whatsoever to interpose between a recovery from

36

New Hampshire, assuming the taxpayers were the ones to
and the obligation to return it to their own states-

recover,
If the

theory of the plaintiffs advanced in this complaint is true,
that result would be reached without their interest being
represented, without any opportunity for those plaintiffs to
even present such a claim—-if you will, a right of setoff or
however you want to characterize it.

There are certain

retroactive problems which may arise in this connection.
point is that this assumption is mad® in the complaint.

The

is no opportunity for the taxpayers themselves to be heard on

of this Court.
If. on the other hand, on® considers all right, let

California v. Southern Pacific Company in 157 US, the original ■
jurisdiction of this Court is defeated, ousted, if you will,

beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.
parties, they are also fatal parties.

If they are necessary
I submit that this

equation, which is the basis of this complaint, and is
precisely that watershed point upon which the plaintiff states
assert their right to the money, is something which cannot be
assumed over the backs of the taxpayers themselves who are
the only ones who ever had anything to do with the state of
New Hampshire

37
This Court applies in consideration of original
actions the accepted doctrines of common law and equity in
systems of jurisprudence,.

This much was held in Texas v.

Florida.
Again,, to simply with respect to the application of
tlie doctrine of hatches, the plaintiffs assert that the State"
of New Hampshire was in bad faith when it enacted the
commuters income tax.

We say to the extent the plaintiffs

claim -that New Hampshire should have known that the tax scheme
was unconstitutional, so too the plaintiffs are also bound
to have analyzed and known that law and should have responded
from the beginning in a manner consistent with their convic­
tions „
I think it is patently obvious that the great part,
if not all, of the injury which they have now sustained or
claim to have sustained could have been obviated by action
taken in the original configuration of th® case as it carae
before the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
it is also more likely th© case that that same action
can still be taken.

1 would point out that this Court in

Austin remanded the Austin case to th© New Hampshire Supreme
Court for further proceedingsf consistent with the opinion of
this Court.

At last check, that case is still before the New

Hampshire Supreme Court, and there has been no action taken one
way or the other.

There has been no request for any action to

38
be taken by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, but it is still
an open case in that regard.
