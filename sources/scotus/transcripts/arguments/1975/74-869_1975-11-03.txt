3HIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We*11 hear arguments first

this Turning in Ho,, 74-869, United States against United
Continental Tuna Corporation.
Mr. Kopp, you way proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. KOPP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KOPPt

Mr. Chief Justice, and xnay it please the

Courts
This case presents the question of whether Congress
in 1960, when it amended the Suits in Admiralty Act, appealed
by implication the Public Vessels Act of 1925.
IS'.03 Suita in Admiralty Act, in general, expresses
the consent, of the United States to ba sued in admiralty.
Th* Public Vessels Act, however, contains specific requirements
which parfeai-i only to suite* involving public vessels.
It's the position of the respondent,and of the Court
of Appeals below, that when you have a public vessel that's
involved, the conditions of the Suits in Admiralty Act only
have to be satisfied.
QUESTION s

Is there a statutory definition of a public

MR. KOPP:.'

No, Your Honor, there is no statutory

vessel?

def: .nifcien*

One of the problems in the litigation is what

is t:i ■ effect of the absence of no definition and the question

4
of drawing the line as to what is a public vestal or what is
not a public vessel.
QUESTION:

in any event, I suppose it*a conceded that

a United States Navy destroyer is a public vessel?
MR. KOPPs That's right.

In thin case it*a absolutely

clear that ra have a public vessel that's involved.
This particular case arose as the result of & collision
which occurred off the coast of California, between -the Navy
destroyer and a fishing vessel owned by the respondent, a
Philippine corporation «■«* although, I might add, that this
Philippine corporation, in turn, was owned by American stock­
holders .
Tii& collision occurred, and the fishing vessel,
according to the complaint, was sunk.

The respondent then

brought suit in ths District Court, alleging jurisdiction under
both the Suita in Admiralty Act and the Public Vassebs Act.
The government moved for summary judgment.

In our

motion, we argued that this was fch© case arising under the
Public Vessels Act.

It involved a public vessel.

Therefore,

ths s-ait had to satisfy the conditions of the Public Vessels
Act, which included a requirement of a showing of reciprocity
in suits by foreign'nationals.
The reciprocity requirement had not been met here,
and therefora we argued that the suit should be dismissed.
The District Court agreed, and entered summary judg-

5
mart: for the United States,
The Court of Appeals, however, reversed.

According

to the Court of Appeals , the Suits in Admiralty Act, as it
currently rb-mds, m a result of the 1960 amendments, expresses
generally the consent of the United States to be sued in
admiralty*

Ho longer when you have a public vessel that*s

involved, although prior to 19 60 you had to do so, you had to
meet the specific requirements of the Public Vessels Act.
Accordingly, the Court found that sines the general
conditions of the Suits in Admiralty Act had been satisfied,
that the suit could proceed, and the Court of Appeals reversed
and remanded.
QUESTION»

Prior to 1960, Mr. Kopp- when, as I under­

stand it, an action could be brought against a government-owned
merchant vessel* under the Suits in Admiralty Act, would that

have been a pi*lie vessel?
MS'.. KOPPs

No.

Prior to 1960, you had suits involving

merchant vestals, which -could be brought only under the Suits in
Admiralty Act.

Suits involving public vessels, which could b©

brought only' under the Public Vessels Act.

And one of the

problems in that,, particular area, which I will get to in
discussing the legislative history, is that you had cases that
didn't fit .into either category, where there wasn’t a public
vessel involved, there wasn’t a merchant vessel involved, and
it was very difficult if you had a contract suit, because this

6

meant: you had to sue ir. the Court of Claims.
QUESTIONs W.sXi, why couldn't- you sue under the Suits
in Admiralty Act,» if you were suing a United States owned
merchant vessel?
MR* KOPPx

If you were suing

QUESTIONs

Rather, under the Public Vessels Act.

HR. KOPPx

Because the Public Vessels Act. -- there

was a distinction set up between the Public Vessels Act,
between a public vessel and a merchant, vessel, there was a
basic distinction? and that a merchant vessel was to be dis~
tir y-■ n a p jfc , i - - vesroi.
other.

'Ira could havd one or the

This was a rigid dichotomy -that was set cut, and you

couldn't in fact have a situation where you had a suit that
involved what you would call a public vessel that would also

fall into the

merchant

vessel category.

The law drew a rigid dichotomy.
QUESTIONs Well, was that just a construction of the
statute?

It wasn't in. the statute, was it?
MR. KOPPs

That's right, that was the construction of

the statute, but that was done explicitly by the Congress.

The

Congress, when it passed the Suits in Admiralty Act, in fact,
intended to draw a rigid dichotomy.

It intended,, in the Suits

in Admiralty Act, to deal only with merchant vessel suits.
The Public vessels Act was passed five, years later, and it
contained additional requirements chat Congress felt necessary

7
fer suit© involving public vessels such as government warships,
for instance»
QUESTIONs

Yon said there wasn’t a statutory defini­

tion of the terra "public vessel", why did Congress use such a
phrase?

It’s not a «*- has there been a. development ■—* a

definition in the case law, admiralty law?
It doesn’t say military vessel or naval vessel or
anything that would foe more familiar; public vessel certainly
doesn’t have very much of a common meaning, does it?
MR» KOPPs

Well, what happened was that shortly

. before these two statutes were passed, Congress decided

or

this Court decided a case, The Lake Monroe, which involved a
statute, the Shipping Act, whereby Congress had said that the
merchant vessels owned by the United Statas were subject to all
the ordinary rules of -admiralty.

So that you had a decision

of this Court dealing specifically with the concept of merchant
vessels, that said that merchant vessels of the United States
could be sued, and were, in fact, subject to all the usual
admiralty procedures.
So, in reaction to this decision, the Congress passed
the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Congress had before if. the
specif.:.. 3 situation of & merchant vessel, and it dealt with that
specific situation.
There was —
QUESTIONs

Excuse me.

X didn’t want to interrupt you.

8

MR. KOPPi

There was,

in fact, & movement in the

Congress in 1920 to expand the scope of the Suits in Admiralty
Act to cover all vessels owned by the United States»

But that

was initially defeated because the Congress felt that there were
further problems, if you had suits involving warships, that had
to be dealt with, and there was a need for time to think about
these particular problem „
QUESTION:

My question was, where did the phrase

"public vessel" come from?

Do you know?

Does it have any case law meaning?

Has there been

a — is it -~
MR» KOPP:

Mo, 1 think the phrase that produced this

case was really not "public vessel55 but was "merchant vessel"»
QUESTION:
MR» KOPP:

Yes.

Exactly. ' Quite a difference»

That's right»

That's right» And, no, I

think what happened was that back in 1920 everybody had in mind
the idea that all vessels of the United States were,in one
sense, public vessels? but there was this fixed judicial
construction of what was a merchant vessel»

So the Congress

drew the definition, or drew iAe line, *»“
QUESTION1: But it didn’t draw a definition, did it?
MR» KOPPs

It did, because it confined the Suits in

Admiralty Act only to merchant vessels.

And then

QUESTION: Well, by implication, then, a "public
vessel" is any vessel owned or operated by the United States

9

that is not a merchant vessel?
MR» KOPPs

That’s right.

You had between ~-

QUESTIOHs

And you get into ambiguous situations#

MR. KOPP:

That’s right# Mr. Justice.

don’t you?

Now# the government saw fit —
QUESTION %

Troop ships or cargo ships chartered by

the Navy or the Army and so on.
MR» KOPPs

Well# actually# what happened was --

QUESTIONs

Passenger ships# not troop ships? passenger

which —

ships.

Merchant freighters.
MR, KOPPs

That’s right.

You had some very difficult

situations that arose as to what was a merchant vessel or what
was a public vessel# and this led to a vary difficult problem
for litigants# because it was all right for them, if they had a
suit, if they could show that their suit involved a merchant
vessel or that it involved a public vessel? because then they
were guaranteed to be able to bring suit in the district court.
Bv:there were some very difficult problems in
drawing the line. There were some cases where you had a situa­
tion whora a court might very wall say this suit didn’t involve
a public vessel, this suit didn’t involve a merchant vessel,
therefor*» it doesn't fell under either the Suits in Admiralty
Act or the Public Vessels Act.

And if yon had a contract —

10

QUESTIONs

What kind of vessel would that, be?

MP.c KOPPs

Well, take, for instance, the situation of

a privately owned vessel, which is chartered by the government
and used by the government to carry wax materials»

Now, this

is a situation that wouldn’t involve a case that could be
brought under the Public Vessels Act, because you had a privately
owned vessel.

So the Public Vessels Act was out.

Now, according to a decision of the Court of Appeals,
by Judge Learned Hand, this also involved the case where you
didn’t have a merchant vessel, because the ship was not being
operated to carry merchant cargo, it. was being operated to
carry public cargo:

war material.

So, according to the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, in the Calmer.Steamship case, this particular situation
fell i.nder neither the Suits in Admiralty Act. nor the Public
Vessels Act.

Therafore, the Court said, since you had a contract

claim that was involved and since your contract claim was for
more than $10,000, this suit could be brought only in the Court,
of Claims»
New, that Second Circuit decision was, in fact,
reversed by this Courts but 'the example of the Second Circuit
decision'was fresh on the minds of the drafters in Congress of
the I960 amendment.

And the Calmar Steamship case was, in fact,

one of the situations that they attempted to deal with in the
1960 amendment.

II
How, the I960 amendment: was passed by Congress
because of this very problem demonstrated by the Cglmar case,
where you had cases that didn't fall into the category of public
vessels or merchant vessels, and they could very well fall into
the Court of Claims»

And what Congress did to deal with this

problem in 1960, it did two things?

it eliminated the old

distinction that you had between merchant vessels arid public
vessels, because this distinction could throw some; cases out of
either classification? secondly. Congress wanted to make it
very clear that all miscellaneous type of cases, all cases that
ware hard to classify# but were in admiralty, would fall into
the district courts»
So this led to the I960 amendment and the specific
language which we now have before this Court*

The Congress
/

amend-.;cl the language,

of

the Suita in Admiralty Act; in 742 to

come to its present meaning, which is — and it's set forth on
page 3s
V

"In cases where if such vessel were privately owned
©r operated, or if such cargo were privately owned or possessed,55
— now, here's what was added in 1960

“or if a private parson

or property were involved, a. proceeding in admiralty could be
maintained"*
The 1960 amendment added the language "of if a private
person or property were involved.“

It also subtracted former

language; in -that a action, which had included a proviso that that

12
section apply only where) merchant vessels were involved,,
So you eliminated •»« the Congress eliminated the old distinction
between merchant vessels and public vessels„
Further# the Congress in this "or if a. private person,
or property" language added language to the Act that was in fact
as broad as th® scope of tit© entire admiralty jurisdiction, and
it did this to make it clear that all admiralty cases against
the United States would now come into the district courts»
You could bo longer have; the problem of cases falling into the
Court of Claimse
Now, th© respondent argues that this change had the
consequence of ©rasing the Public Vessels Act»

The Public

Vessels Act, prior to this time, clearly applied only to public
vessels.

And the respondent now contends that because its

situation, a situation involving a public vessel, is the situa­
tion "or if a private person or property were involved”, a
proceeding could be maintained, that now it could be maintained
in its action under the Suits in Admiralty Acte
But Congress did not feel it necessary, when it was
amending the Suits in Admiralty Act in 1960, to mention the
Public Vessels Act, for a very particular reason? and that was
because the Public Vessels Act, in Section 782, contains
language which, in effect, makes it clear that when there is
any conflict between tht- Public Vessels Act and the Suits in
Admiralty Act, the Public Vessels Act must prevail.

13
??<•••!r, this particular language is the language that's
set out at the bottom of page 4 of our brief, in Section 782
of th<& Public Vessels Act*

Section 782,

in the very last

sentence, provides * , “Such suits" «**■* now, those are suits set
out in Section 781 above,. 55for damages caused by & public vessel
of the United Statas”

"Such suits shall be subject to and

proceed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 20 of this
title, the Suits in .Admiralty Act, or any amendment thereof,
insofar as the same are not inconsistent herewith»*'
In other words, we have in Section 782 a specific
provision that declares that in the event of any conflict
between the two statutes, the terms of the Public Vessels Act
must prevail»
Thus, in 1960 Congress felt no need to include any
express; guaranty of the Public Vessels Act was not being
repealed, because it could rest confidently upon this language
in Section 782 to prevent this result,
QUESTION:

You would concede — I think yon have in.

your brief, Mr. Kopp ~~ that taking the language of the Suits in
Admiralty Act, as amended in i960, without, reference to any
other legislation, that the Court of Appeals was clearly correct
here?

Mk, KOPP s

If the language of the Suits in Admiralty

Act is read in isolation ~
QUESTIONs That's what I mean

14
MR* KOPPs

and by itself*

But we would submit that if that language is read in '
context* anci in context with the Public Vessels Act
QUESTION* And also in context with its legislative
history»
MRS KOPPs
history

And also in context with its legislative

a totally differant result is reached* Because w®

have this vary provision that reconciles the two statutes.
QUESTION»

And your reference is to “insofar as the

same are not inconsistent herewith”?
MR, KOPPs

Thats -3 right; Mr. Justice.

QUESTIONS Well; what6s the inconsistency?
MR

KOPPs

Okay.

In this particular case, the Public

Vessels Act contains a reciprocity requirement in Section 785.
It provides «— and this is at the top of page 5:
WN© suit may be brought under sections 781 to 790
of this title” *— that actually means under this Act*, that's
the way it was in the original statute — "by a national of any
foreign government unless it shall appear to the satisfaction

of the court •.. that said government, under similar circum­
stances,. allows nationals of the United States to sue in its
courts,”
Now, one could, in fact, read that provision as not
creating a conflict with the Suits in Admiralty Act.

But its

plain meaning and intent is that obviously Congress felt that

if you had *. suit involving & public vassal of the United
States and & foreign national were involved ? the foreign
national could not bring that suit unless he could meet a
shoving of reciprocity»

And it*s certainly inconsistent with

that interpretation of Section 785 to then turn around and say
that the foreign national, however. could bring suit under the
Suits in Admiralty Act»
The Congress would# in fact# be giving foreign
nationals a more favored status than they would be giving their
own

citizens, because American eifcisens in suits involving

public vessels would have to sue under the Public Vessels Act.,
So that*s why we say thars? is such a conflict.

It*s

not. a strictly — it's not a conflict that's inherent as a
matter of linguistics, but 1 think in terms of the plain
meaning of the statutes# the conflict is quit® obvious.
QUESTION: Well# there's at least one other limitation
©£ importance# isn't there?
MR. KOPPs

That's right.

Mow# the Public Vessels Act

was enacted because there were certain requirements 'that
Congress felt really we're essential in suits involving public
vessels# and there are only a handful of such requirements.
Perhaps th© one that was most in the forefront of
the Congress at the time that it was enacting the Public Vessels
Act was i provision which is now in Section 784 of the Public
Vessels Act,

That's not. in our brief.

Section 784# which

previd®s that:, subpoenas may not be issued to the members of the
eras* of £t public vessel without the consent, of the captain or
the Secretary of the Department concerned»

This was a condition

that the Congress felt was unique to public vessels, and it was
vary important to have that in there, because if you had a suit,
involving a warship, it would be intolerable to permit the
vessel to be tied up at a dock while its crew members were off
testifying in court»
So that that’s why we have Section 784»
QUESTION s

And then you have the other provision that,

at least in tiros of war, the Secretary of the Navy has the
unreviewable power to stay all proceedings,
ME» KQPPs

That’s right*

In 1944, that provision

was enacted and it gives the Secretary the automatic right to
r@qu.irs a stay of all proceedings under the Public Vessels Act»
These provisions would, as a practical matter, be
totally voided by the decision of the Court of Appeals, which
would permit anybody to bring a suit under the Suits in
Admiralty Act; today, instead of the Public Vessels Act.
QUESTIONS

I’d like to get back again, Mr. Kopp, to

your colloqury with Mr. Justice Stewart.
What is your submission as to the limit of public
vessels?
MR. KOPPs

A public vessel, we would submit, means

a vessel that is owned by the United States and operated solely

17
for governmental purposes *
QUESTIONs

hs,

for example* a Coast. Guard dredge,

that dredges a harbor?
MR. KOPP s

That's right.

QUESTION: That would be a public vessel?
MR. KOPP3

That would be.

This is to be distinguished

from the situation, for instance, where you have the United
States, which charters a vessel but with a private crew, and
that crew remains in control of 'the vessel throughout the voyage.
QUESTIONS

But even in cases, I gather* of charter

vessels, you may have a public vesseli is that it?
MR. KOPPs

If the United States in fact has a bare

boat charter, a charter where it acquires ownership for the
purpose of the voyage.

Government ownership is a prerequisite

for -«
QUESTIONS

Government ownership.

But on a bar®

boat, charter, would it have to be —
QUESTION:

That's the equivalent of ownership.

MR. KOPP:

It’s the equivalent of ownership.

QUESTIONs

And the United States would have to pro-

vide its ora or®w?
MR. KOPP %

That’s right.

QUESTION t

Well, your definition is self-defining,

This «—

it5a a bootstrap definition? any vessel owned andeperated by
the United States is, presumptively, owned and operated for the

18
gove minent of the United States.
MS, KGPPs

That’s right, and it’s a public vessel?

but it’s not a merchant vessel, a vessel that’s being operated
for hire.
The typical situation involving a merchant vessel is
the situation that arise® where the government, to develop the
merchant marine, has to build and own a freighter, for instance,
because there isn’t simply enough capacity in the private
industry to do so.

So the government builds this freighter,

it has title to the freighter,, and then it lets it out to
government contractors who use it. in ordinary commercial inter­
course.

the United States, as opposed to a government contract, I would
say that would be a public vessel»

Had.
MR. KOPPs

Well, I'm not saying the drawing of a line

today between merchant vessel and public vessel is a totally
automatic 'thing.

All I'm saying is -that the 1960 amendment

was not enacted because of the problem of drawing the distinc­
tion., per se, between public vessels and merchant vessels?
rather, it was drawn because you could have cases where you had

20

neither a public vessel nor a merchant vessel.

The public

vessel/merchant vessel distinction could throw some cases into
the Court of Claims.

And that was why the 1960 amendment was

enacted.
Now, there's absolutely nothing in the legislative
history to «*QUESTIONS

I take it# you suggest that if there was a

chartered troop carrier here that had been involved in this
accident# the suit would have had to have been under the Suits
in Admiralty Hot?

Or it could have been.

QUESTIONs And there would need to be no reciprocity.
MR. KOPPs

There would need to be no reciprocity?

that's right.
QUESTION j

But if the destroyer -that was. escorting the

ship gets in the accident# there must be reciprocity?
MR. KOPPs

That’s right.

This is the holding of the

Palmar steamship case in this Court; where the Court was faced
with -this very similar problem:

a private vessel transporting

troops and war material and manned by a private crew.

And the

Court there# in effect# said that the consequence of our holding

21
that this case does not involve a merchant vessel would be to
throw this suit into the Court of Claims.

Therefore , because

w@ don't think the Court of Claims is properly an admiralty
court# we are going to conclude, essentially as a matter of
policy, that we have a merchant vessel involved in this situa­
tion*

And therefore the plaintiff could bring -suit in the

district court under the Suits in Admiralty Act*
And it. was because of a problem as was presented by
the Calmer case that the IS 60 amendment was enacted*
But, new, there*® absolutely nothing in the legis la*»
tive history to indicata any way that Congress intended to
repeal the Public Vessels Act*

Congress was concerned with

this very specific problem of the jurisdiction of the Court of
Claims in relation to the district court.
The Public Vessels Act was not amended in any way*
In the legislative history there is absolutely no discussion at
all that the terras of the Public Vessels Act are onerous or
unjust*
One would think, if Congress was going about repealing
the Public Vessels Act, at the very least -there would be some
discussion along those' lines * There's no discussion of any of
the differences between the Suits in Admiralty Act and the
Public Vessels Act*
Again, if Congress war© rationally going to go about
repealing the two statutes, you would expect at least a bare

22
minimum of discussion, for instance, as to why it's unjust to
have a reciprocity requirement»
QUESTION; So you say that you may read a statute
different from what it says on its face, just because of
congressional silence, and the existence of another statute?
MR. KO'PPs

Well, cur position is not just that,

because we say that on the face of the statutes, when they are
read in context, -~

Because of the existence of another

MR. KOPPs

Because of the existence of another

statuto, which indicates how the Suits in Admiralty Act should
be read, and silence,.
QUESTIONS

And, of course, we have in this case —
So the legislative history you're referring

to is. silence.
MR» KOPPa

That's — there’s absolutely no intent at

all reflected in that legislative history to repeal -the Public
Vessels Act»
We have here really a classic case of repeal by
implication, where, under the Court of Appeals decision, Congress,
without thinking about the Public Vessels Act, just simply —-

23

and not standing it in any way

' Simply repealed it.

QUESTIONS Well, really, your argument, at best, is by
analogy there, isn't it, because if th© Court of Appeals is
right, the Public Vessels Act remains as a source of authority
for bringing suits, it*s just another statute has been expanded
to overlap with it a great deal.

Maybe you've got argument by

analogy, but it isn't a repealer, certainly.
MR. KGPPs

Well, it is in fact a repealer, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, and the reason is because the Public Vessels
Act consists of a series of extra conditiones, more onerous
conditions, that Congress has imposed upon the Suits in
Admiralty Act for suits involving public vessels.

So that no

plaintiff today, given his choice between the two statutes, is
going to sue under the Public Vessels Act.

they have available the Suits in Admiralty Act, which is the
more favorable statute»
NOv, there’s an© situation where* the Public Vessels

24

Act is in fact snores favorable to litigants, and that’s in the
area of vemm*

The Public Vessels Act and the Suits in'

Admiralty Act both provide that whan you have © suit that’s
brought in the district where the vessel can be found, you have
to bring suit in that district*

If the vessel can’t be found.,

then you. can bring the suit in the district where the plaintiff
has his place of business or residence.
The Suits in Admiralty Act then stops there. But the
Public Vessels Act goes on to say if the suit **•“ if the vessel
can't be found, or if the plaintiff does not have his place of
residence, then you can bring suit in any court..
So, in a situation where the vessel can’t be found,
and the plaintiff has no place in residence, he might be able to
get venue under the Public Vessels Act, but not under the Suite
in Admiralty Act.
But that’s not a very real distinction, because why
would Congress have set up a statutory scheme that turns, for
instance, on where you can find venue?
Further, virtually all public vessels, at some point
within a taro-year period, return to the United States and can
be found within the United States#
So that this little distinction really is meaningless*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS J. MacLAUGHLIN, ESQ»»

m BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR» MacLAUGHLXN*

Mr, Chief Justice? and may it

pi@es© the Courts
I would like to begin my discussion of this case by
asking the Court to consider in practical terras the significance
of -this decision and what the government is asking us to hold.
New? if the role of tort feasor and innocent victim
in tills collision were reversed — that is? if the Philippine
vessel had been negligent? and it were the government's vessel
which were damaged or sunk — the government’s remedies are
quite clear»

And there is no question at all but wh&t they

culd h&v® that Philippine vessel arrested and sold in ran, if
necessary? in order to satisfy their damage claim*
Also, they could commence an in personam action
against the Philippine owner here in the courts of our country?
as the government has done in the past, end it has standing to
do it in the courts of the Philippines or in any other civilised
nation which follows the general maritime law»
Now? that would be the situation where the government
has been damaged»
But in tills case it's the Philippine shipowner who
has bean damaged, and it's the government, we allege, which has
been negligent»
New, what the government is saying, in affect, in this

26

lawsuit# as 1 understand their'position, is that liability
arising from ship collisions in these circumstances should be
a one-way street.

If the government has been damaged, it has

the right to recovert but if a Philippine shipowner has been
unfortunate enough to have suffered damage as a result ©f a
collision, he has no right to sue, because —
QUESTIONs

Well, I didn’t think the government was

making that analogy,—
QUESTIONS
QUESTION?

Before 1960«
— Mr. MacLaughXin.

I thought 'they were

juxtaposing the position of an te@ri.can national damaged by a
Philippine ship, .and comparing his right to sue in the Philippias
Courts.

Is that not the way he argued?
ME. MacLAUGHLINs

Wall, Mr. Chief Justice, I’m not

sure I heard — I listened closely enough to answer your
question. But. with —
QUESTION?

Isn't that the heart of the reciprocity

issue?
MR. MacLAUGHLINs Well, that's the way the statute is
worded, and that’s what X*m suggesting is unfair about it.
Because her© is this poor little Philippine shipowner, and the
United States can sue him, they can sell his vessel in rein to
pay their damage claim? but the government says ha has no claim,
against them.
QUESTION? Well, the fact that a statute is unfair in

27
some respects, does that male® it totally vulnerable?
MR. MacLAUGHLINs

No, Your Honor.

And 1 do want to

discuss the statute itself, but I started out by asking the
Court to considar the case in terms of practical, equitable
considerations»
And what I'm suggesting is that a result which deprives
a Philippine shipowner of his right to recover his damages from
the government is basically unfair.
QUESTIONS

But there's no doubt that would have been

the result before -the i960 amendment, is there?
MR. MacLAUGHLXNs
QUESTIONS

No question at all,

And that's the way sovereign immunity is

operated forever,
MRa MacLAUGHLINs

That's the way it's operated

forever, «*«
QUESTION s And the rule in our cases has been that you
don't you construe congressional waives» of sovereign immunity
rather s trictly?
MR0 MacLAUGHLXN*
QUESTION*

It's exactly the opposite, Mr. —•

Oh, really?

MR. MacLAUGHLINs

— Justice Whit©.

They're construed

liberally.
QUESTIONS

Liberally for whom?

MR. MacLAUGHLXNs
QUESTION:

Liberally in favor of the claimant.

As the Court of Appeals said in this case,

28

in any ©vent.
MR. MacLMIGHLIH s

Tliat1 s correct. And several courts

of appeals have said tSiat, and this Court itself, in the past,
has •—
QUESTIONs

But you need express waivers by Congress,

don’t you?
MR. MacLAUGHLXNs

Oh, that's correct, but the waiver,

once made by Congress, is liberally construed in favor of
claimants.»
QUESTIONi Hell, fee waiver her© is with respect to
— is with respect to all kinds of government vessels.
MR. MacLMJGHLXN*
QUESTIONs

That’s correct, Your Honor.

So it isn't

is it a sovereign immunity?

MR, MacLAUGHLXNi Well, these are really reverse sides
of the same coin.

The government says, "we can't be sued unless

w@ have consented to b© sued®, and this consent is liberally
construed under the oases as we read them.
QUESTIONs Are you suggesting that there is something
inherently unfair about a statute which provides that foreign
nationals can sue in the American courts and recover if the
nation of that foreign national extends the same rights to
American citizens?
MR, MacLAUGHLXN: Nell, if the same right were extended
to American citizens there, there would be nothing unfair about
it.

29
QUESTIONWall* th&t's til® heart of a .reciprocity
statuta always# isn't it?
MR. MaeL&UGHLXN: Well# that's the way the statute is
phrased«

But what Ism suggesting is unfair is*

how about the

individual Philippine citizen who can be sued in his own
country by the United States, or he can be sued here to satisfy
their damage claim?

I'm suggesting that it's unfair to deny

equal rights to him as against the United States.
Now, there may well be good reasons.■--in fact, I'm
persuaded that there are — to deny the Philippine Government#
or any other government which refuses to submit to suit, to
deny these; the right to recover from the united states.
But it's basically unfair to deny an individual
citizen,who is subject to the United States' claim, equal and
reciprocal rights under the law.
Now, we believe that Congress —

if 1 may address

myself to the Suits in Admiralty Act — we believe that congress
by this Act# as amended in 1960# has abolished.the pre-existing
distinction which existed between public vessels and merchant
vessels.
The legislative history ©£ the Act recitas, according
to the Senate Report, that a substantial portion of the juris­
dictional uncertainty in this area is attributable to the
confusion in establishing whether a. ’vessel is a merchant vessel
or a public vessel.

And the courts in the late Forties and

30

early Fifties had tremendous difficulty trying to decide what
war©

public vessels and what were merchant vessels, and was

there a gap between them»
And the Senate and vita House looked at this confusior,
and their report reflects that they were concerned about it*
And at the bottom, or after reciting a number of these cases,
the Senate Report reflects what the Senate wanted to do about
it.

And it says that the decisive question in a lawsuit should,

as far as possible, be its merits and not esoteric technical
problems of procedure.
So this was the Senate’s attitude, and this was the
House's attitude when it considered the I960 amendment»
know that they were upset about the confusion»

We

We know that

they were upset about the technical disposition of cases, and
that they desired these cases to bo heard against the govern­
ment on their merits*
Now, the statute which they adopted is perfectly
plain* It eliminated the old restriction concerning merchant
vessels, so that the statute, as now worded, applies generally
to all types of vessels.
So the statute on its face is plain»

The government

says that if we look at the legislative intent we will see that
..Congress really intended, after eii, to preserve the public
vessel distinction and to separate out from the Suits in
Admiralty Act damage caused by public vessels.

31

Exit the legislative history is completely silent on
that. The government has bean unable to show, ©r to invite our
attention to any portion of the legislative history which would
show that*
Indeed, if I may say so, or invite the Court’s atten­
tion to this Court’s earlier decision in Am©.11 vs* United
States, which was decided in 1966, shortly after this Act was
amended, the Court stated in that case that the old distinction
was abolished*
And the government’s brief in that case, which is a
part ©f the records of this Court, is her© before me, and if I
may quote from page 19, the government at that time reviewed
these jurisdictional problems and then said:

The same problem

led Congress in the 1960 Act to abolish the distinction between
public and merchant government vessels, which had caused
uncertainty and led to frequent misfilings.
So -this was the position of the government in 1965,
when this issue was last presented to the court,,
QUESTION3 But that doesn’t address itself to -the
reciprocity issue, doe® it?
MR. MacLAUGHLIHs

No, it does not.

It addresses

itself to the meaning and interpretation and purpose of the
Suits in Admiralty Act*
I’m suggesting that the Suits in Admiralty Act, as
amended in I960, abolished the marchant/publie vessel distine-

32

tion, and now encompasses claims caused by any type of vessel,
I*ia suggesting — in fact 2*sn inviting th® Court*s
attention to the fact that 'this was precisely the government's
position when it presented its brief to the Court in connection
with the Amell case.
New* the government counsel has made an argument here
this morning which X did not see in his brief, though it may
well b® there, and he*® invited our

attention to this sentence

which appears in Section 782 of th© Public Vessels 'Act -~
QUESTIONS Where are you reading from, now?
MR* MacLAUGHLINs

I*m on page 4 of th© petitioner's

brief, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Th® main brief?

MR, MacLAUGHLINs
bottom of th® page.
our attention readss

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice, at the

.And th© sentence to which counsel invited
'’Such suits shall foe subject to and

proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of
this title, th® Suits in Admiralty Act, or any amendment
thereof, insofar as the same are not inconsistent herewith,"
I think what counsel has suggested, or what In® means
to suggest, is that this sentence means that -when there is an
overlap between th© Acts, that th© claimant must proceed under
th® Public Vessels Act.
Not, I don't read it that way.

I think what this

says is that, when the claimant is proceeding under the Public

33

Vessels Act, the procedure then will be as specified in the
Suits in Admiralty Act, except where the Public Vessels Act
otherwise provides»
It does not say that a claimant must proceed in the
event of an overlap of jurisdiction.

It does not say that a

claimant must proceed under the Public Vessels Act, or that,
in that event, the Public Vessels Act supersedes the provisions
of the Suits in Admiralty Act,
QUESTION8

Hell, does that, Mr. MacLaughlin, give any

emphasis to the first few words, “such suits shall be subject
to®?
MR. MacLAUGHLXN§

I think "such suits” refers t©

suits which are brought sanciar the Public Vessels Act,,

Ami it

is saying that when a claimant sues under the Public Vessels
Act, that claim will bs heard in accordance with the Public
Vessels Act end in accordance with the provisions of the Suits
in Admiralty Act, except when the provisions of the Suits in
Admiralty Act are inconsistent.
In other words, it is prescribing a procedure to be
followed when a claim is mad© under the Public Vessels Act,
but it does not say, I respectfully submit, it does not say
that, a claimant must proceed under this Act? and it. does not
say tliat in the event c£ dual coverage under the Acta that the
Public Vessels Act supersedes the Suits in Admiralty Act.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kopp [sic], if you* re correct, and

34
tine Court of Appeals is correct,, why would any plaintiff ever
proceed under the Public Vessels Act?

Rather than the Suits

in Admiralty Act»
MR* MacLAUGHLXN: Well, Mr* Justice Stewart# the only
reason I can think of is the one which the Court of Appeals
suggested# and that is that the venue provisions are slightly
different and in a particular case it might well be that a
claimant could not secura venue under the Suits in Admiralty
Act# but could do so under the Public Vessels Act.
QUESTIONs

Excuse is®# Mr* MacLaughlin, I called you

by your ~~ and that’s the same kind of situation mentioned by
Mr. Kopp*

You can’t think of anything else# any other possible

reason?
MR. MacLAUGHLXN:

No# I can’t# and that is 'the only

situation 1 can think of*
QUESTION t

Yet! *

MR* MacLAUGHLXN%

Wo have an alternative theory of

recovery # which w© presented to the district court and to the
Court of Appeals, and if# for some reason# this Court decides
to reverse the Court of Appeals on the Suits in Admiralty issue#
we would respectfully request that it consider our claim under
the Public Vessels Act.
Mhd?

in particular# we invite the Court’s attention

to the admiralty doctrine under which a shipowner’s nationality
is determined according to the nationality ©£ the real or

35

beneficial owner of the company.
We looked through the technical state of incorpora­
tion# and it is only right in this day and age to do so# because
many shipowners# in the United States and elsewhere# incorporate
and register vessels under flags of convenience# and you can't
tell anything ©bout their nationality# and they ought not to be
permitted to escape from liabilities rightfully imposed or
would b© imposed against them in their own country*
QUESTION3

But the Court of Appeals didn’t consider

that»
MR» MacLMJGHLIN;

That’s right»

That’s righto The

Court of Appeals decided the case on the basis of the Suits in
Admiralty Act# and did not rule upon our alternative theory*
QUESTION'S

if there were more of these .amendments,

that would cam© from the kinds of cases that didn’t fall under
the Suits in Admiralty Act or the Public Vessels Act, I gather?
MR* MacLAUGHLINs There was a real question as to
wh@tlif.sr or not —>
QUESTION? Wall# let's assume that there were.
And tliat Congress was aiming at curing that# I take it* But
those cases were —• could still be «*■- the cases before 1960
that didn’t-fall under either one of those Acts could still be
brought under some — in some other court?

Could be brought

as a federal tort claim or in the Court of Claims?
MR. MacLAUGHLINs Well# the courts were in conflict, on

36
that issue, because there was a real question as to whether
or not a vessel-caused claim would lie under the Federal Tort
Claims Act or under any other Act»
QUESTIONS But some courts held that they could?
MR» MacLMJGHLIMz
could not.

1 think most of 'them held that they

So that -tic a claimant —
QUESTIONS

The word 13contracting” is —

MR. MacLAUGHLINs

That's right»

So that if a. claimant unfortunately could not bring
himself within the definition of a public vessel nor within the
definition of & merchant vessel, h© had no remedies,
QUESTION a

Well, was that because of some lack of

an authorisation to bring suit, ©r was it because there wasn’t .
any waiver of sovereign immunity?
MR,, MacLAUGHLIN s

I think the courts construed it as

a lack of waiver of sovereign immunity.

The government —

QUESTION: Moll now, is there something in these
amendments which would indicate that a suit that fell outside
those Acts before the amendment, but now falls within one or
the other or both of 'them, could not be brought in the Court of
or
Claims/under the Federal Tort Claims Act?
MR. MacLAUGHLINs
QUESTION $

No, you <—

Is there the same possibility there was

before that —
MR, MacLAUGHLINs

No, X think not.

Because the

37
language adopted in .1960 is far broader»

It says that where,

if a vessel were privately owned, a proceeding —
QUESTIONs

Well, I understand that, but let’s assume

that that was perfectly clear, but what if you — what if this
case had been brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act?
MR. MacLAUGHLIN:

It could not, because th® Federal

Tort Claims Act contains a provision which says that if there
is jurisdiction under th© Suits in Admiralty Act, «—
QUESTIONs

Oh, I sea? that’s all right,

MR* MacLAOGHLINs

— that it will not lie under the

Federal Tort Claims Act*
QUESTION* And is that true — you couldn’t bring it
in th® Court of Claims?
MR* MacLAUGHLINs

2*ro not aware of the rule with

respect to that quote.
I have nothing further to add, Mr, Chief Justice*

I

would be happy to try to answer any further questions of the
Court* But if there are none, I have nothing further.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;;
