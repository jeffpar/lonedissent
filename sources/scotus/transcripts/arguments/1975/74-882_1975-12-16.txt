ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. CATE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR.. CATZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The petitioners are here on writ of certiorari to
the California Court of Appeals, Second Appellate District.
This case raises the question of whether a state statutory
scheme?

which prohibits domestic employers from employing

aliens not entitled to lawful residence is unconstitutional
ureter -the doctrine of federal preemption.
It. 1971 the California legislature
Code a metier. 2805.

encated Labor

This statute was enacted in recognition

by the California legislature chat increasing numbers of
illegal aliens coming into California were imposing severe
hardships ca. the state's economy.

The statute provides in

part—«and the statute is reproduced ...a our brief, petitoners'
brief, at pace 3—that no employer shall knowingly employ
an alien who is not entitled
United States

to lawful residence in the

if such employment would have an adverse

effect on lawful resident workers.

4
Zn addition to the above provision, 2805 imposes
misdemeanor penalties on employers who utilize illegal labor
and in addition create

a

private cause of action against

employer's who—which allows employees to go into the local
superior court to enjoin an employer's use of illegal labor.
The facts in this case are that petitioners,
domestic farm workers from California, were employed by
respondents ., far labor contractors, for approximately three
months during the summer harvest season of 1372.
In September of 1972, respondents laid petitioners
off on the grounds that respondents had a surplus of labor
and thus had no work available for them.

As a direct

consequence of being laid off and believing chat respondents
were; employing illegal labor, petitioners commenced this
acriori in the local superior court in Santa Barbara,
California, pursuant to Section 2805, alleging that
respondents were open and notorious

employers of illegal

labor.
Ir fact, at one point in our complaint petitioners
allege that curing a four-month period in 1972 the United
Star.es Border Patrol visited the worksite of respondents and
apprehended eve-.* 40 illegal aliens.
Among other things, petitioners sought their own
job reinstatement, damages, and a permanant injunction against
respondents

willful and continued employment of illegal

5
aliens.

After a full evidentiary hearing on a motion for

preliminary'' injunction in which petitioner sought to present
evidence of respondents1 use of illegal labor, respondents
filed a demux* challenging the validity of Section 2805 on
the ground that trie statute was preempted by federal immigra­
tion law.
The trial court grafted respondents* demur and
declared Section 2805 unconstitutional on several grounds
but specifically on the around that aha statute was
prompted by federal immigration law.

The petitioners

subsequently appealed this ruling to the California Court of
Appeals which affirmed,

-and tJis California Suprema Court

denied petitioners1 request fc.t discretionary review.

A

petit.:.on for cert was sought to this Court and granted.
Lt. issue here today Is the constitutionality of a
stabc statutory .scheme fashioi ed to protect citizens and
lawful resident workers from via unfsir competition by the
infirr of illegal aliens into California.

That the problem

of ii/agal aliens as one of great public importance of
coarse is not in dispute today.
ity

Thin Court, took the opportun­

outline: the scope of the problem last term in its

ser:..o ; r:f '7.; j. bolder patrol cases.
in Cellfornia the problem of illegal aliens is
parcularly route because of California’s close proximity to
the Mexican border.

Illegal aliens go virtually unchecked

6
producing drastic effects, particularly on low-income and
minority residents who suffer substantial job displacement.
In addition, illegal aliens create a substantial
wage drain into Mexico, adversly affecting the local
economies.
Q

The only question we have is whether this

field, has been preempted by federal legislation.
MR. CATZ:

Q

That is correct ,, Your Honor.

Was it clear from the decision of the

California Court of Appeal

that your clients would have

been entitled to relief under tie California statute had the
Court, of Appeal not found it to be preempted?
MR. CATZ:

I think that if you look at the

appendix, Your Honor, the Superior Court's opinion, he
expresses the view that he had. no doubt that we could have
established the facts of the case.
Q

Your are talking about the Superior Court

rather than the Court of Appeal?
MR. CATZ:
Q

That is correct.

How about the Court of Appeal*

MR. CAT2:

I do not think the Court of Appeals

really addressed chat because ihe case went up on a demur,
and it was just considering the validity of the statute
itself>
T.VU3 ■ we submit that without a favorable

adjudication of ‘the constitutionality of Section 2805, a
continued employment of illegal aliens

may render jobless

thousands of lawful resident workers in California.

In

addition, domestic employers who, by long time business
practice, intentionally seek out and rely on illegal labor
will profit, at the sake of the economy and will do so with
total impunity.
It this time I think it might be helpful if
petitioners outlined for the Court how the ‘State

statutory

scheme operates; and what obligations it imposes on domestic
California employers.
In 1971 when the statute was enacted, it imposed
the primary enforcement obligations of the statute on the
California Labor Commissioner.

Pars', -ant to Section 2805,

the California labor Commissic/i&r promulgated a comprehensive
set of regulations interpreting Section 2805.

And the

regulations are found at pages, la through 3c; of petitioners *
reply brief.
First, the California Labor Commissioner defines
an alr..c-n entitled to lawful residence as any non-United
Stata;; citi sen who possesses document ation issued by the
Federal Gcvera-uent authorizing him or her tv work.,

Thus

when, an app.lic.ant employee seeds employment, an employer has
an express obligation to inquire whether the applicant be
either a ci ci sen or an alien.

If the applicant employee

8
claims to be a citizen of the United States, he mist sign a
declaration to that effect under oath.

If an applicant

claims to be an alien, he must then display proper federal
documents that are issued by the Department of Labor attesting
to his employment certification.

This must be dona within

three days of commencement of employment.
Employer liability than attaches when he fails to
take the steps I have just described and later on an employee
is; found tc be an unlawful resident alien.
C:

Mr. Cats, the statute is conditional.

says, "Mo employer shall knowingly

It

employ an alien who is not

entitled to lawful residence in the United States if such
employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident
workers."

Has there been any administrative definition of

that oondition?
MR. CATZ;

Yes, there has, Your Honor.

The last

regulation~-*ifc is in the reply brief at 3a—defines what is
an adverse effect.

That, is at page 3a. of petitioners' reply

br. .ei.,
(

Of your reply brief, page 3a?

MR. CAT2:

Yes.

Sec-lien 2805 requires that the use

of i?legal labor must have an adverso effect on lawful
resident workers, as you have pointed out, lour Honor.
Adverse effect arises whenever illegal labor is employed in an
occupation not deemed to be a shortage of labor in that field

9
by the Secretary of Labor and the United States Department of
Labor.

The Department of Labor promulgates and enlists

these areas of employment in this country where there is u
shortage of labor, and those regulations are found at 29
CFR, Section 60 et seq.
In addition, adverse affect is defined--arises
whenever an employer pays an illgeal worker less than the
prevailing minimum wage, either state or federal.

Thus for

purposes of a hypothetical, physicians is one occupation or
profession in which the Secretary of Labor has seen that
there is a shortage in this country.

So that if an illegal

alien came to California and was engaged as a brain surgeon
and was employed by a California hospital, as long as the
California hospital paid him in excess of the minimum wage,
thfe hospite.! employer would not bs subject to liability.

In

the. case w« have here today, there is a surplus of agricul­
tural labor.

In other words, liability attached against the

respondents, because the Secretary of: Labor of the United
States did not. list agriculture as a field in which there was
a shortage of labor.
When federal and state laws have regulated in the
same area, this Court has evolved two basic approached is
determining the constitutional preempdlvability of the
stats law in question.

The first approach or test is often

referred tc as occupation, and that renders any state attempt

10
to regulate in the federal area invalid even though it may be
agreed that the state scheme

does not impair but enhances and

aids in the? achievement of a federal goal*

The lower court

in 'this case he Id--and this is the error that we complain of-that 2805 was an attempt by the State of California to
legislate in the area of immigration, and the lower court
concluded that Congress by the mere •enactment of a comprehen­
sivo immigration nationality act, that of 1972, thus had
expressed its intent by just the mere enactment to have
occupied the field.
V® believe that the lower court erred because any

judicial preemption decision in this case, based on the.
occupation test, should not have been applied, and we

say

that because first there is nc textual evidences in the Immi­
gration ant';. Nationality Act or its legislative history or even
other federal

laws that Congress specifically intended to

proclude the stares from enacting listi ted statutes such as
2805v

W© 6 ubmit that Section 2805 is not on immigration law

but a law that regulates the labor practices of domestic
employers,
Ve will concede that ih-s statutes long-range
effect o3i ha/a an incidental» effect on immigration, but the
statute does not regulate immigration policy.

Instead, the

stutubs prescribes a specific employment practice of domestic
employers.

Section 2805 and its implementing regulations

issued by the California Labor Commissioner used federal
immigration and labor law definitions to effectuate a local
labor law policy.

The statute in no way alters federal

determinations concerning entry into the United States and
under what terms and conditions entry may be made.

Section

2805 merely precludes the knowing employment by California
employers of those individuals defined by federal law and
administrative practice as not authorised to work in tha
United States by virtue—
Q

Does that federal statute impose e. penalty

for knowingly employing an illegal alien?

Did that ever

pass?

MR. CATZ:

No, Your Honor.

MR. CATZi

It very much is. but there is—

If that were to pass, would that make a

difference?
MR. CATZ:

It might.

If is my feeling that it

certainly would deal with the problem, but how it would
affect this case I hesitate to say.

I might say that there

12
is no action foreseen on the Rodino bill in the Senate at all,
and no hearings are scheduled.

And my information is that

none is expected.
Q

Mr. Cats. I presume you feel your case is

stronger by virtue of the fact that California's regulation
is limited just to illegal aliena rather than if it had been
-to all aliens, legally or illgally.

addressed

MR. CAT2:
aliens.

It goes a little bit beyond illegal

In other words, it defines lawful resident aliens

as anybody who really is not certified by the Department of
Labor to work.

Thus, for example, if a student from

South

Korea was attend ...ng the University of California at Berkeley
and decided to gat a job during the summer and did not have
propere certification from the 'Qsj artarent of Labor authorizing
him to work, zr employee who v;$s adversely affected by him or
her ‘liking that position could1, get. injunctive relief tinder
Section 2805,
but the primary purpose cf the statute of course was
to tec.:, with the problems of illegal aliens which Congress has
refused to deal with, at least ir the ampleyment area.
Q

If you deal with lawful aliens, you have

problems with cases like Truar v. Raich.
MR. CAT2That is correct, but vien 2 use the
term lawful residents, that is a definition that does not
cons from the federal scheme; that is the Labor Commissioner's

13

definition of dealing with who is allowed tc work by federal
standards.

There may very well be people who are entitled

to be in the United States but not entitled to work.
the statute goes

And so

little bit beyond illegal alien.

Anybody

that comes into California who is either a citizen or author­
ized to work by the Secretary of Labor will not be affected
by Section 2805.

Q

Mr. Catz, in you;; answer to my Brother

Rehnquist a cacent ago, I understood you to say that, as you
told us earlier, the statute as administratively construed
does not mean what it seems to say; it does not apply to
aliens who are not entitled to lawful residence

but rather

14
to aliens who are not. entitled to work in the United States.

That is correct, Your Honor.

to note that, first- of all in tin area of employment other than

deals -with this area that California has entered into.

But it

is important, to point out that illegal aliens do not even come
in contact with the State of California in Section 2805.

If,

for example, the California Labor Commissioner were to go out.
and visit an industrial factory and discover that there were
500 illegal aliens working there, the California Labor
Commissioner would have no authority to apprehend

despite the immigration law?
MR, CATZ:
Q

That is correct.

And do you not think that is somewhat

persuasive with respect to the validity of the California
law in its entirety with respect to the intention of
Congress ?
MR. CATZ:

I think it is, Your Honor.

I think that

Congress has last spoken on the area of illegal aliens with
the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act, and it attempts
to get to the root of the problem.
X think a final

word perhaps needs to be

mentioned about the anti-harboring provisions of the
Immigration end Nationality Act. P and there /it page 7 of our
reply brief,

This is the only specific federal statute

which respondents argue poses a potential conflict with
Section 2805, and that is Section 274(a)(3) of the act.
This section provides that any person who "willfully or
knowingly

conceals, harbors, or shields from detection any

alien not duly admitted or not lawfully entitled to enter or
reside with In the United States shall be guilty of a felony."
To prevent the interpretation that, employment per
se would constitute a crime under this section—and I
emphasize the word "this section"--Congress added the

IB
following proviso:

"Provided, however, that for purposes of

this section employment, including the usual and normal
practices incident to employment, shall not be deemed to
constitute harboring."
This statute, while exempting employment per se from
the crime of harboring, does not purport to grant an
absolute exemption from criminal or civil sanctions for
employers of illegal aliens.

There may well be a given set

of facts in which the knowing employment of illegal aliens,
part .culariy -where an element of concealment or procurement
is involved, may subject an employer to criminal sanctions
under the act.
There has been no specific judicial interpretation
of 271(a)(3), 1 believe, by this Court,

Ai examination of the

legislative history reveals that the congressional intent
was to prouecfc tie innocent and unknowing employer from
prosecution under this section,

So, we would argue that

274(cO (3) indicates no more than congressional silence
regarding v prohibition againe.the intentional and knowing
employment oil illegal aliens.

-This section does not express ar

intent fco protect. the knowing employment of illegal aliens,
either in its» text or in its legislative history, and neither
does this section express an intent by Congress to preempt
the state---

C

1 gather that you are relying, if I read your

brief correctly, rather heavily on what was done in the
Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act even though that is
limited only to farm labor since it expressly says that it
is intended to supplement state action.

That in itself is

explicit on the part of Congress that is this whole field
state regulation was permissible.
MR. CATS:

I agree, Your Honor, we are relying

heavily on the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act
amendments.
Q

On that very point, Mr. Cafcz, we do not have

the Solicitor General here to inquire further, but at the
conclusion of his memorandum filed in opposition to your
cert, he says—
MR. CATZ:
C

What page. Your Honor?

At page 6, second to the last paragraph.

"In considering legislation making the employment of aliens
a crime, the Congress has indicated that the problem is a
nati c rial one which requires a more delicate balancing of
interests than that achieved by California law."
Do 1 get an undertone there that there is a
delicate diplomatic problem that enforcement of the
California type of statute would irritate Mexican and Centra
American countries?
MR. CATZ;

Of course, respondents have vigorously

argued that point and gone one step further and suggested,

20
for example, that Section 2805 will drive illegal aliens
out of California into neighboring states.

And I would

just like to say that perhaps the potential is there for
that but in fact there is no raechan;.sin for enforcing this
statute.

I would be less than candid if I would say to the

Court that Section 2805 will be a panacea for solving the
immense problems California is having»

But I would say that

if the statute has any value, it at least provides a. vehicle
until Congress c.eals with a limited number of employers in
California that knowingly

hire illegal aliens and rely on

illegal labor ir running their bus.i ness?*

California does not

have the resources to strike out against employers.

But at

least it will be in a position to deal with those few

employers ri vf will be abusive.

,

So I do not think there is

an nc\u&l problem that will transcend beyond the California

borders,

fho problem is national

Q

Ms , Cats

on pegs 4 ©:: the Solicitor General *

memornandum, you will notice that footnote four is addressed
to ycur argument based ©n the Farm Labor Contractor Registration
Act.

It says, "While that act -'ionterolates some limited room

for state lew, fits state law must be 5appropriate, 8,1

And "2805

is not in accord with federal policy r and thus is not
appropriate."

I gather that is an attempted answer to your

proposition that since Congress already said states may
operate in the field of farm labore then that, must also be an

expression of congressional, intent that states may operate
generally in the field of all alien labor; is that right?
MR, CATZ:

1 would think so, but I am at a loss to

understand the Solicitor’s conclusion that it is not
appropriate.
Q

Of course I do not recall anything—
What is that 2051 ’’appropriate"?

MR. CATZ;

The word "appropriate” comes from the

language of the Perm Labor Contractor Registration Act on
Section 15

and I do not know wh&fc the makers of the bill

meant, by appropriate.
Q

It seems to me that that at least goes some

direction toward:? conceding that there is no overall
preemption just from the existence: of an unexercised federal
power»
MR. CATZ:

I think that is correct, and that

would be or.® of our arguments.

I think that this case, if I

may suggest to the Court, can be adequately disposed of on
a very narrow ground, and that is that the; Court of Appeals
rendered 2805 unconstitutional on the: basis that by
Congress’u mere enactment of the comprehensive Immigration
ant! Nationality Act, that Congress intended to occupy the
field without, rhere being anything me-re.

We would suggest

that the Court dispose of this case in the same manner in
which :lt disposed of the Deb lino case, which.- was v. recent
preemption decision of this Court where New York had

implemented the state WIN program, and there was a federal
WIN program.

And the lower courts declared that the state

WIN program was preempted by the federal ADC program.

In

rendering a decision in this case, this Court did not reach
the conflicts question and we are merely suggesting that thi
Court need not reach the conflicts question either, that it
can render its decision based on the occupation test alone.
Q

I am not sure I understand that.

It is

asserted in this case that the state law, even if there is
no overall preemption from the federal power, that there is
a conflict between state law and federal lew, an actual
conflict.

Why must not we reach that?
HR. CATZ:

I was suggesting merely that since the

lower court rendered its decision based on the occupation
test slone, chat that perhaps might be the only question
that was before the Court.
Q

By occupation you mea \ federal occupation of

the field?
MR „ CATS' s
Q

That is correct.

And you would say that then we would have to

remora for the lower court to reach the conflict in order
for a state court to reach it.
MR. CAPE:

That is merely one suggestion that I

offer, and 1 do that simply because of the way this case
disposed of the Deb lino mattes.-.

23
Q

Kas the thought perhaps that the California

court would have a sharper idea than we would of the
application of 2305?
HR. CAT?.:

In all candor—and I say so respectfully

I do not think the California court knew why it rendered the
case unconstitutional.

There are overlapping doctrines in

its opinion, and it is hard for the reader to conclude
whether they reached the preemption decision on either
occupation or conflict.

And I invite the Court to look at

that opinion
In closing., we respectfully urge this Court to
reverse the» lower court's declaration that Section 2805 is
unccrsstitutionai on the grounds of federal preemption.

We

do e.o because we believe that Section 2805 is but a labor
statute that touches on the field of immigration law in an
incidental but in a very limited area that Congress has not
expressly indicated its intent, to occupy the field.
And, finally, the statute, far from conflicting
with

: •:vi'::.-1 law, furthers the accomplishment of federal

law policies and therefore is not preempted.
C

Cats, is the record in any shape for us

if we were tc agree with, you that there has not been an
occupancy, that there is room for state regulation?

Is the

record sufficient so that we can decide whether i.i fact
the state law is in conflict?

24

MR» CATZ:

I think there is room in the record, end

there is a substantial transcript as well.
Q

But how about if the state court did not

really reach the question, which you suggest they did not; is
that right?
MR. CATZ:

I think the opinion is rather nebulous,

and I—
Q

Then we would not know precisely what the

state law reaches or what it means.
HR. CATZ:

Perhaps, Your Honor.

for the Court to determine.

That of course is

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Marts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. MARKS, ESQ.,
'JK BEHALF' OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, MARRS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
It is respondents * position that 2305 of the Labor
Code

±3

unconstitutional on

inree grounds.

The first is that

it deals with foreign affairs and immigrations, which is a
subject of such dominant federal concern that states are
precluded from legislating in that area,.
clearly 2805 will discriminate against the nationals
of a foreign sovereign.

This may be a subject which Congress

may want to do, hut. it is our contention that it is not up to
the State of California to take that in their hands.

Q

That has apparently been the case with farm

Congress has said that the State of California may

do so.
MR. HARRS:

Yes, in the case of farm labor.

2805

applies to all employers.
Q

I suppose there might be an issue as to

whether the state law were severable.

If it were invalid in

MR. MARKS:

I am not sure I understand the

It is severable as to farm labor only?
Q

The California law at issue here covers

farm as well as Industrial labor,, does it not?
MR. MARKS:
Q

Yes.

Let us assume that if ifc were just a farm

labor law it would be valid.
MR. MARKS;
(

X would disagree with that.

Let us assume that it was.

Could this law

be upheld in so far as it applies to farm labor?
MR. MARKS:

If 2805 applied only to farm labor, I

would say that it could not be upheld because the Farm Labor
Contractor Registration Act took into account the state
scheme, but that was as far as- the safety and health
standards*

There are some 12, 1 believe, states who already

have large regulating farm labor contractors as far as the
health and the safety of the employees, and I believe that

is what that was after and not that they had passed laws
regulating the employment of illegal, aliens, and they were
just inviting them, to do that.
2805 also controls immigration rather than just
being a labor law.

First of all, the so-called illegal

aliens will be unable to secure employment in the State of
California, and those that are working will be terminated.
There is also a group of aliens that are not entitled to
lawful residence: but who are able to work under the federal
scheme who would not. be entitled

to under 2805.

Petitioners put much reliance on the regulations
which tried to save 2805.

Those regulations were adopted

three days after a superi.or court judge in Los Angeles
declared 2803 unconstitutional in the Dolores Canning case,
which was che other appellate case.
Q

When you say other aliens, do you mean the

green card people who would come across on a daily basis?

MR. MARKS:

1

will gat to those.

It is going to

regulate those also.
Q

Are you intimating that the regulations were

prepared in that three-day interval?

MR.. MARES:

I am sure they were.

And I also think

that if this Court upholds 2305, the Labor Commissioner
could rescind those regulations, and we are right back with the
statute again with no regulations.

So then we have what is an

27
adverse effect.

Who is entitled to lawful residence?

The

regulations errs not embodied in stone.
Also in California particularly there is a
problem with illegal aliens who have come across into
California, particularly in southern California, who have got
jobs, have families, married and have families, and they are

status adjusted from illegal alien to lawful resident

California*—
2

Are they not disqualified from working as a

matter of federal law?
MR. MARKS:

No, they are not.

In fact, those people

are encouraged by the Immigration to keep working to support
their families until they can get their status adjusted.
Q

Then as I understood it, and perhaps I

misunderstood it, 2 understood your brother1s submission to
be tl;t under these regulations, the California regulations,
anybody permitted to work as a matter of federal law is
permitted to work under this statute.

Did I misunderstand

that?
MR,, MARKS:

No.

The regulation says anyone in

28

possession of the green card or any document issued by the
Immigration that authorizes them to work, but they do not
issue

these documents to these aliens who are subject to

having their status adjusted.
it takes a period of time.

They know where they are, and

They have to investigate their

background and they do not. issue them a letter or anything
that says they can continue to work because it is not a
problem in the federal statute.
Q

When you say subject to having their status

adjusted, that, means they are illegally here?
MR.

Ml.ms s

Q

Yes .

I.nd they are not: authorized by the Federal

Government to work?
MR. Mjs.RRS:
Q

Yes, they are authorized to work.

Expressly authorized?

MR. M3ERS;

They did not come in under a visa, but

the policy of the government it to continue them to work while
they rx« having their sb&tus adjusted.
Q
n::'i'

But that is a matter of discretion.

They can

-n applvcstion for status adjustment and it .may have been

turned down by the commissioner, may it not?
MR. M&fcRS:

Yes.

how msny but I ax sure it would be i:.: the thousands--wooId

Q

And deportation is than suspended, pending

outcome of the change in status hearing.
MR. MARKS:
Q

Yes.

Are you talking about the same type of aliens

in the government they make such an effort to keep from
crossing the border?
MR. MARKS:
Q

Initially.

If so, why are they not arrested and deported

if they may be arrested as they cross the border?
MR. MARKS:

Usually these tire people that have

been here for fcur or five or even ten or twenty years who
have families and are part of the community, and they are
either a parent, a child or a spouse of a citizen or a
lawful resident alien.

And the government * s policy is to

keep them in the country until they can get. their status
adjusted.

Otherwise they are going to break up the family

units.
Q

Soi the longer they cm get away with it, the

tetter is their status.
MR. MARKS:
0

I would think that is probably true.

I did not hear you.

MR. KARRS:

Yes, that is true.

Congressman Sisk

I believe has. a bill in right now to recapture those or
everyone that has been in the country I think it is three
years

will be granted an amnesty type thing so they can have

30

their status adjusted.
Q

How does the government justify not giving

green cards to them?
MR. MARRS:
Q

Well, the green card is—

None of this is in the record, is it, that

you are talking about?
MR. MARRS:

On the green card?

yes.

q

MR.

MARRS: No.

And the fact that 3one are here without green

cards but the

Federal Government allows them to work, is that

it the record?
MR. MARRS:

Is it in the record?

HR.

MARRS s No, it is not.

consider it?

I was just bringing it up in relatio::,

as far as the 1-151 cards

and na documents.
Q

Suppose we disagreed .eith you and with the

lower court with respect to the general preemption or
occupation.

Are you urging us here to sustain the judgment

on the ground that there is an actual conflict?
MR, MARRS:
conflict with 1324(a).

Yes, I think there is an actual

31
Q

But the lower court did not decide that?

MR. MARRS:

The lower court went on the occupation

ground, that the Immigration and Nationality Act was so
comprehensive that the states were precluded from acting
even though the federal scheme--there was a void there.
I think 2805 in the regulations brings us; right
into the situation of Truax, and that is if 2805 is valid,
then prudent employers in the State of California will
refuse to hire all aliens whether they are illegal, green
card, or whatever status, so that the burden is not on then
to determine the legal status.

These people are not

protected by Title VII as far as alienage is concerned, and.
they would either lose their jobs or would have to take
lower paying jobs with employers who needed to recruit other
people from the work force,
Q

Wliy on earth would an employer hesitate under

this California statute to hire an alien who had a green
carit

Because in order to vie late the state statute he has

to knowingly employ an alien who is not permitted to work in
the United States.
MR. HARRS:

Then he is put in the position of

judging whether the green card is valid to start with.

becomes the arbitrator as to is he' ix here legally or is he

It would be much safer for him just to
And I think in California, especially

in southern California, that is a real possibility,
Q

He does not violate it unless he knows that the

man is here illegally.

He knows when he hires him, but he

also must know that he is violating the statute.

If he has a

green card, how could he possibly be knowingly hiring
somebody who si not entitled to work?
MR, MARRS:

Maybe the green card is a forgery.

I

mean, he cannot tell.
Q

Maybe visas and passports are all forgeries.

MR. MARRS:
Q

That is conceivable.

But you could not convict a man for that.

If he looks at what appears to be a legitimate green card,
how could he be charged with not doing that?
MR. MARRS:

Then I think you get down to what is a

legitimate green card or someone else that is an alien that is
entitled to work but does not have a green card.
Q

Is not the green card valid on its face?

Would

it not constitute an abundant defense to a criminal action
in

California courts?
MR, MARRS:

I do not know.

This law has never gene

The date it was to take effect it was enjoined

by a superior court.

So, we do not have ary case law on it

at all.
If an alien with a 151 card loses his 151 card or
has it stolen,then he also has a burden on him.

Until he gets

a new card, the employer wouId not hire him.

And it takes

from six months to two or three years to get a new 1-151
card.
It is also our position that 2805 is unconstitu­
tional because the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952
is so comprehensive that they have left no room for the
states to legislate, and I think there is a specific intent
by Congress to occupy the field here.

The nature of the

subject matter, foreign affairs and immigration, the
pervasiveness of the legislation is very comprehensive.

The

legislative history indicates that Congress thought they
were passing a comprehensive bill.

The only earlier state

legislation on this was struct down as violating the foreign
commerce clause.

And in 1917 when the Immigration and

Nationality Act was passed, that continued until 1952.

There

had never been a valid state intrusion into these affairs.
2805 falls within the parameters of the Hines decision, we
contend, because there is such a comprehensive scheme of
regulation that the states cannot help it, they cannot hurt
it, they cannot do anything to it.

They have to stay away

from it.
The third ground upon which we believe 2805 is
unconstitutional is that it is in direct conflict with
3.324 (a).

2805 makes it a crime to knowingly employ an

alien not entitled to lav/ful residence.

1324 (a) grants an

34
exemption for such employment.
Q

Is 1324(a) the California statute?

MR. MARKS:

No, no, that is the Immigration and

Natlon ality Act.
Where is it cited or set out in the brief?

Q

MR. MARKS:

And the proviso is

What about the
There is one, is

MR. MARKSs
Q •

Yes, there is.

I do not see any preclusion of a civil remedy

here, do you?
MR. .ARRS:

As regards 1324(a) there is not.

H.R. 982 and now 8713 specifically repeal that
proviso and attach liability to the employer.

It is interesting

to note that the way they do it, though, is in a three-step
process, and that is, one, they give a citation;

two, there

is an administrative fine; and then, three, there is a
criminal penalty.

And Congress did this I think trying to

balance some interest because there are various groups that
feel this will cause discrimination against minorities.

35
Q

This is in Roman nine and Roman ten of your

brief?
MR. MARRS:

That will cause discrimination by

employers against minorities in this field.
Q

This was amended, you say, the proviso on

page Roman eight of your appendix to your brief? it has been
amended?
MR, MARRS:

It has been deleted in the proposed

legislation.
Q

Proposed.

MR. MARRS:
Q

Yes.

That proviso is still in effect?

MR. MARRS:
Q

It is only a bill, is it not?

Yes, it is.

And there is a bill pending that would delete

it and would substitute a three-step process.
MR. MARRS:
Q

Yes.

The first a warning, I think.

MR. MARRS:

A citation and then a fine and then

& criminal penalty.
Q

And that, is so far just pending legislation?

MR. MARRS:

That is correct.

I think that shows a little evidence that Congress
is well aware of this problem, and they are trying to find a
way to solve it, and California’s way is not their way.

They

specifically rejected the original bill that, came in with I

believe it was a thousand dollar fine the first time out,
similar to California; it is only a lesser amount.

And they

rejected that because they thought it was too severe, it
would cause problems on employers, and it would cause
employers to discriminate against
Q

certain minorities.

Of course, Congress has been aware of the

problem presumably a long time and has not done much about it,
has it?
MR. MARKS;

Yes.

In fact, they were aware of it in

1952 whan they passed the act and in the legislative history.
Q

Is there any doubt but that Congress, if it

elects to occupy the entire? field, could nullify all the
elate statutes in this area ultimately?
MR. MARKS:

I believe they already have, but there

is no doubt that they can.
Q

If they have not, they certainly can.

MR* MARKS:

Yea, that is

inherent

in the sovereign

power of the nation.
linen the act. was passed, there was reference by the
petitioner to the Congressional Record*

Senator Douglas it

1952 offered an amendment to Senate bill 1851, which became
this exemption, 1324(a), and his bill would have removed that
exemption and made it a crime to knowingly employ an employer.
And that amendment was turned down.
So, in concluding, it is our position that this

37
subject, is of such dominant federal concern and Congress
has weighed the burdens and the rights of all aliens in this
country and that the federal branch conducts foreign policy
and foreign affeulrs and that California is intruding into
this area and they are prohibited from so doing.

Mr. Marrs, on a very unimportant point, is
