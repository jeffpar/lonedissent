MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Carey against Randolph and Curtis Circulation against
Randolph.
Mr. Busner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP II. BURNER, ESO. ,
ON BEHALF OF CURTIS CIRCULATION CO., ET AL.
MR. BUSNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case raises the question whether a State can
devise prejudgment seizure remedies to protect its citizens
against fraud, which will comport with due process under the
Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
It comes to this Court on direct appeal from a threecourt judgment

by a three-judge panel that was convened in

the Southern District of New York, whose judgment held
unconstitutional all of the provisions of the New York
attachment statute, the grounds of which are based upon
fraudulent activity by a defendant.
The provisions are found at subsections (4), (5) and
{8} of Section 6201 of the New York Civil Practice Lav? and
Rules.
Subdivision '4' provides that a judge, in his
discretion, upon a prima facie showing by evidentiary facts
til at a defendant with an intent to defraud his creditors has

assigned; disposed of, or secreted his assets, or that he is
about to do the same.
Subdivision (5) permits a judge in his discretion to
issue such an order, upon a priraa facie demonstration that the
plaintiff has a cause of action in contract; and* secondly, that
the defendant has committed a fraud at the inception of that
contractu
Subdivision (8) permits a judge in his discretion to
issue such an order upon a demonstration, priraa facie, by the
plaintiff that he has a cause of action for either fraud or
deceit»
I think it would be helpful as a model if I briefly
stated the facts which underlay 'the attachment in this action,
and which led to the commencement of the action in the lower
court.
The appellant, Curtis Circulation Company, a national
distributor of magazines, entered into a written agreement with
Bert Randolph Sugar, a publisher of sports magazines, and a
corporation which he then called Champion Sports»

Under the

terms of the agreement, Curtis agreed to make advances to
Champion, based upon estimates of the sales of the magazines.
And the agreement provided that in the event that the payments
they made were excessive because the estimates turned out to
be wrong, they would have a right to recoup those overpayments »
from subsequent editions of the magazines that were covered by

5
tli i s ag reeme nt.
At the time the contract was entered into , Sugar
represented to Curtis that he controlled Champion and that
Champion was the owner of the magazines.
After it had been in effect for some eighteen months,
and at a time when substantial moneys were due to Curtis by
Champion, and the contract still had three and a half years to
run, Curtis discovered that Sugar had stripped Champion of all
of its assets and had arranged to sell all of its magazines
to too different purchasers.
It learned that the seller under the two purchase
agreements was not Champion, with respect to whom Sugar
represented was the owner of the magazines, but another corpora
tion called Wrestling Revue, over which Sugar also had control.
And it also learned that all the consideration
payable under these too agreements of sale were payable by
the purchasers to Wrestling and not to Champion.
It learned that Sugar had represented to the
purchasers that Wrestling was always the owner' of the magazines
that Champion, although the ostensible owner, was just
publishing these magazines under an alleged license agreement
with Wrestling? that it had failed to pay its license fees?
hence Wrestling revoked the license and now was in a position
to come to these purchasers and sell all of these magazines
tree of any obligation under the Curtis distribution agreement.

6

Rased upon those facts , Curtis determined that it
must have been defrauded at the inception of the contract, wher
Sugar said that Champion was -the owner of the magazines , or
tliat Sugar had defrauded it after the contract and stripped
Champion of its assets by concocting this alleged license
agreement and the purported ownership by Wrestling.
Accordingly, the determinate had to act promptly to
arrest the further flow of those assets into hands or places
where it would not be able to satisfy its right to recoup, or
its rights to damages for fraud, idle contract still having
three and a ha?f years to run, and they having lost their
opportunity to distribute those magazines.
Curtis applied, ex parte, pursuant to Section 6211
of tile New York statute, for an order of attachment.

In

support of that application, as the statute requires, it
submitted the sworn affidavit of its secretary, which contained
evidentiary facts, the facts largely but in greater detail than
those I’ve just described to Your Honors.

Annexed to the

affidavit was the verified complaint in the action, a copy of
the distribution agreement, and the detailed statement of the
account between Curtis and Champion, showing the moneys then
due and owing to curtis.
QUESTION:

The verified complaint contained the

same recitals as were contained, I suppose, in the affidavit
and as you have orally told us about

7
MR. BUSNER:

The gravamen of the complaint was

largely the sans, but the complaint was broader and less
detailed and did not go into the evidentiary facts to the same
extent that the affidavit did.
QUESTION;

The complaint was submitted to the judge

along with the affidavit, is that right?
MR. BUSNER:
QUESTION;

Yes, Mr. Justice -Generally in New York you continue to

have pocket process — you still do, don't you?
When you file a complaint, the first time that
anything gets filed in a court in New York — this used to be
true, as I understand it; and tell me if it's still true -- the
first time anything gets filed in a court is when you ask the
court for some sort, of action.
MR. BUSNER; That is correct.

The statute talks about

commencing an action at the time you ask for a provisional
remedy.
QUESTION; Righ f.
MR. BTJSNER:

In this case it would be attachment.

Although I do want to make it plain, you don't have
to serve the complaint or the papers in advance.
ex parte application.

It is an

.

QUESTION; Right.

Right.

MR. BUSNER; The statute doss require you to serve
the complaint on 24 hours' notice what is demanded, and not

8
beyond sixty days.

That length of period being designed

primarily for in rem jurisdiction, where the defendant might
be out of State and might take quite a while to serve him and
possibly require an order of publication and so forth.
QUESTION;

And this — the issues here involve both

involve all three subparagraphs,
MR. BUSNER:
QUESTION;

(4),

(5) and (8) of 6201?

Yesj yes, they do* -Or just ~

MR. BUSNER;

— Mr. Justice.

We moved-under all four

sections, and the order was granted under all four sections.
QUESTION;

What is

what?

Fraud at the inception

of the contract?
MR. BUSNER:
of assets.

The first one is fraudulent secretion

(5) is the contract action brought in the inception

of the contract.

And (6) is simply an action for fraud or

deceit — I!m sorry, that’s (8).
QUESTION:

(8), yes.

(8) is any action

for fraud

or deceit.
MR. BUSNER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice.
Yes.

MR. BUSNER;

As —
\

QUESTION;

Was there any finding here that -these

assets were being wasted so as to — the defendants would be
j udgmentproof?
MR. BUSNER;

You mean a finding by the court or —

9

QUESTION:
MR. RUSHER:

Yes.
— what they —

No, there was no

evidentiary hearing below, and there5s been no such finding
by a court.
Certainly not in the federal court and it's now on
the ready calendar in the State court.

We just don’t have a

record on -that right now, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. BUSNER:

Unh-hunh.
With respect, to the grounds upon which

the lower court relied for its decision, it really relied
entirely upon three distinctions which it perceived this case
had, from this Court's decision in Mitchell v. W. T. Grant.
It held, first, if I can paraphrase it -- it held
first that although it recognised the defendants in 'the State of
New York had a right to immediately move to vacate the attach­
ment, one of the matters discussed at length in Mitchell, this
Court

found that under New York law the burden of proof

upon the preliminary hearing was on the defendant, and they
held that that did not comport with due process.
Secondly, reading Mitchell most narrowly, the Court
seemed to require, as a sine qua non of any prejudgment
seizure, that ‘the plaintiff have a prior vendor's lien or
statutory lien in the property which he sought to attach.
Finally, related to the second ground but somewhat
different was the Court's finding that allegations of fraud

10

are not amenable to facile proof on a preliminary hearing»
And as I read the Court's decision, that being the case,
there really — if one follows that to its logical conclusion,
you just cannot get a prejudgment seizure based on fraud that
will comport with due process.
Because the lower court certainly wrote, in view of
the decision in Mitchell ~~ which, incidentally, was decided
after the complaint was originally filed but before the three
judges convened to hear and determine the action

Mitchell,

as I read it, certainly doss not place the emphasis on whether
there is issue in the first instance, ex parte, or whether it's
done after* notice. The emphasis there is the preliminary
hearing.
I think the lower court correctly followed that
concept, but in holding, from its reading of Mitchell, that
fraud could rot be easily proved at a preliminary hearing,
therefore fraud could never be the basis for an attachment?
I think is an extraordinary proposition on its face.
The court seams to go equally as far with respect to
the vendor's lien.

I don't think that ‘this Court intended in

Mitchell that, absent a vendor's lien or a statutory lien,
a plaintiff could not, under any circumstances, get a prejudgment seizure.
QUESTIONS

Suppose the New York law permitted a

seizure -- an attachment prior to any notice of hearing, and

11
then provided for no hearing whatsoever after the attachment,
and prior to final hearing and judgment, on whether or not "the
attachment was proper?
Would you argue that that law was valid?
MR. BUSNER:

If I understand your question, absolutely

no hearing between the ex parte taking and plenary trial.
QUESTION:
MR. BUSNER;

Exactly.
My understanding of your decision in

Mitchell, Mr. Justice White, and -QUESTION:
MR. BIJSNERs

That, was 'the Court's decision.
I!m sorry.

You wrote it, but the Court's

decision, and also the Court's decision in North Georgia v.
DipCh©ra, would indicate to me that I could not successfully
make that argument.

I think it’s clear that there has to be

some opportunity before the plenary trial —
QUESTION: To do what?
MR. BUSNER:

For the defendant to come in and at

least get the judge’s ear, to test what the plaintiff has told
the judge.
QUESTION: And that has *— that goes broader than
whether- or not there may be a danger of losing the assets?
It has to

wouldn't you agree, it has to go to,

at least to soma extent, to the merits of the basic plan?
MR. BUSNER;

Yes, but to a very limited extent.

QUESTION; All right. But whatever it is, it has to

12
bear on that, claim,, to that extent?
MR. BUSNER: That’s correct.
QUESTION;

I think to be fair under

Just as your affidavit did.

MR. BUSNER:

Yes, I believe it did.

QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

Now, you say that the New York law — well, I’ll
start over.
As I understand the district court, it said that
under the New York law, as it understood it, the opportunity
for the defendant to make any showing between the ex parte
attachment and the plenary trial related solely to the danger
of losing the assets.
MR. BUSNER:

I'm sorry. ' I misunderstood what you

were asking me before.

You mean the so-called unnecessary

security test that the court applied below?
When you talk about the danger of —
/

QUESTION:

Well, I'll put. it the other way then.

I'll put it the other way, counsel.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You can address yourself

to that after lunch, if you understand the question.
MR. BUSNER:

Thank you. Your Honor.

I'm not sure

that I do, but I’ll see.
QUESTION:

Give me an answer if you get. it.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed, to
reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.3

AFTERNOON SESSION

NR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER!

Mr. Busner, you may

continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP II. BUSNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF CURTIS CIRCULATION CO., ET AL. -Resumed
MR. BUSNER:

Ifd like to correct an impression I may

have left by virtue of a question asked of me by Mr. Justice
Blackmun earlier in the argument.
The question was asked, whether there was a finding
in this case that there had been secretion of assets.

I took

the question to mean "Whether -there had been a final determina­
tion or a judgment.
Or course there was a finding by the judge who signed
the order of attachment based upon the allegations and proofs
submitted to him on the ex parte application.
With respect to the question -that Mr. Justice White
left with me at the adjournment, I*m not. sure what the question
wasc but I believe you were

referring to the ground in the

New York statute which permits a defendant to move to vacate
the attachment upon a showing that the security is unnecessary
to the plaintiff.
QUESTION;

Were you referring to that, Mr. Justice?
Well, let’s suppose that the district

court was correct in reading the New York law to mean that
>

whatever hearing the defendant could precipitate didn’t include

14
any opportunity for either him or the plaintiff to address -the
merits.
MR. BUSNER: As I read Mitchell and North Georgia v.
Di-Chem, if that were the case, —
QUESTION;
MR. BUSNER;

Yes.
— if the defendant were restricted to

the question whether the security was necessary, I think the
law would ba unconstitutional.
QUESTION: Well, now, do you think the district court
read the New York law that — the applicable New York law that
way?
MR. BUSNER; Absolutely.

And it's clear from the

face of the statute, it's clear from the legislative reports,
it’s clear from all of the decisions that have preceded the
three-judge decision on that subject, including most of the
decisions cited by the three-judge court, —
QUESTION;
MR. BUSNER;

Yes.
— and since the decision of the three-

judge court, there have been at least a half dozen, perhaps —
QUESTION;

So that you say that the three-judge court

just made the mistake in reading the New York law?
MR. BUSNER;

Quite obviously.

A most egregious

error.
QUESTION;

But if we accepted its reading of the

New York law, its judgment would be correct?

15
MR* BUSNER:

I think that that would have to follow

from Mitchell and Di-Chen,
QUESTION s
MR. BUSNER:

Yes.
Because I think that those cases do

require soma sort of opportunity for the defendant, to
immediately go to the judge and point out any improprieties
that exist in the papers upon the initial application.
QUESTION:

Well, was there any suggestion in this

case by anybody that the district court either abstained or
that it dismissed the case in light of the pending New York
State proceedings, which involved all these partias?
MR. BUSNER:

Yes.

A motion was made on that ground,

Mr. Justice White, before the three judges were convened to
hear and determine.

We made that motion to Judge Lasker, who

had originally had the case, and he rejected that ground, and -QUESTION:

What did you

did you just ask for

abstention or did you ask for sort of a Younger v. Harris type
dismissal of the whole case?
MR. BUSNER:

Both. We asked the court to abstain and

to dismiss, and to give the State court an opportunity to test
the validity of the attachment, or, if the defendant cared to
raise the constitutional objection, the State court to do it
there.
QUESTION: Well, what do your courts decide in these
later cases?

16
MR. BUSNER:

Except for — there was one appellate

division, second department,, case that’s cited, that refused to
follow the three-judge court, as did a number of other lower
court decisions, —
QUESTION:

Any attempt to get to the Court of

Appeals with that?
MR. BUSNER:

With -that case?

I just don’t have any

knowledge whether that case is being taken to the Court of
Appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, does this development since the

judgment of the three-judge court suggest that 'there should be
a vacation and a remand for reconsideration in light of these
New York decisions?
MR. BUSNER:

No, I don’t think so, Your Honor,

because I think the law was clear on that point before -these
— this —
QUESTION:
court

Yes, but the fact is that the three-judge

read --- looked at the New York law and it cited what

it thought were controlling authorities in New York, including
cases in courts higher than the courts that have acted since
the decision.
You think they
HR. BUSNER:

misread the —
That's correct, but there is absolutely

no authority that they cited —
QUESTION: Well, I know you don’t, agree with their

17
reading of it* but, nevertheless* they read it* they read the
New York law that way.
MR. BUSNER:

Yes* but 1 think ny disagreement is

more -than simple advocacy on my own part.,

It’s quite obvious

from the language of the statute* it’s quite obvious from the
circumstance that the very decisions that they cited* except
for -two or three* were all decided upon grounds other than the
unnecessary security test.
The lower court* for instance* said that they were
interpreting cases — the statement was that these cases? * for
fifty years* had so construed the statute.
The fact of the matter is that the unnecessary
security test x*?as only added to the statute in 1963* when our
Civil Practice Law and Rules superseded the prior State
Practice statute* which was known as the Civil. Practice Act?
without that provision at all* it has always been the lav/ in 'the
State of New York.

I don't think there's any reasonable argument

about it.
QUESTION2 Well* as you know* Ifm sure* it's most
unusual for this Court to re-examine findings of federal
district courts or Courts of Appeals on matters of State 1aw.
MR. BUSNER:

I think this is so obvious* Mr. Justice*

if you’ll forgive me* I just have to say* —
QUESTION:
times since,

Well, I've heard that argument many

18
MR. RUSHER:
classic case.

If that’s so,, I think ‘this is the

It is most obvious in this case* from the

legislative reports and from all of the decisions — not only
the decisions which followed the lower court decision.
QUESTION:

Do you think your opponent is going to

agree with you?
MR. BUSNER;
Justice White.

I wouldn't be at all surprised* Mr.

The point was never raised by my opponents in

his briefs to the three-judge court.
is just beyond me.

Where they got it from

It is that obviously bad* in my opinion.

Based on that basic misapprehension by the threejudge court* they also came to the conclusion which really
formed the main ground of their decision* that the burden of
proof was upon the defendant in New York upon the motion to
vacate.
Numerous New York decisions have stated quite clearly
that the burden of proof remains upon the plaintiff beyond
his original application* and upon the motion to vacate.

It

is,true other decisions have stated that upon the motion to
vacate* the defendant carries the burden.
But I submit* when you view the entire statutory
scheme* those cases really stand for no more them -the proposi­
tion that the plaintiff already having submitted his proofs
and his evidentiary facts* showing his prima facie case* now
comes the defendant* when he makes his motion* it’s incumbent

19

upon him to test or to try to rebut that prima facie showing.
And I think that procedure in Hew York obviously
comports with due process,
i

QUESTION;

Do you -- the opportunity that the

defendant must have to either extract from you or to have you
make a showing as to the validity of your case, do you think
that showing can be wholly satisfied with papers?
Just with affidavits?
MR. BURNER;
QUESTION:

Yes.

One© we — we make the ~~ once ---

Let's assume the defendant moves to set-

aside the attachments after this initial ex parte attachment;
and you agree that there is open an issue on the merits.
Now, do you think that he's entitled to require that
you have a live witness there, or witnesses?
MR. BUSNER;

Unless the issue is extremely narrow,

such as on a general release, or if the defendant was supposed
to be somewhere that he can demonstrate he wasn't there, or
some simple issue like that, upon which he can have an
evidentiary hearing, under C.P.L.R. 2218, which is the general
section covering motions- except for that, quite frankly, if
all he's going to do is raise issiies of fact or defenses, he
will not get an evidentiary hearing, in all probability,in
New York.
I do not think it's otherwise in Louisiana.
QUESTION;

Or . well, isn’t «— do you think, then,

20

you have to make any showing other than-*»-» on the merits -—
other than what you demonstrated ex parte to get the attachment?
MR. BUSNER:

No.

No, I think we would go through 'the

procedure of using live witnesses and the same documents on an
oral hearing.
QUESTION;

Oh, I know, but you Sciy you don't need to

gat to an oral hearing at all.
MR. BUSNER:

That’s correct.

Then I misunderstood

your last question, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION: Well, I’m -- you 'think that —» you -think
v-

the New York law now makes adequate provision for whatever
hearing the defendant is entitled to?
MR. BUSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do.
And I;m just trying to ask you whether

you think ha is entitled to have an evidentiary hearing.
MR. BUSNER:

As a matter of comporting with due

process, whether that’s a -- no, I do not? I think the New
York procedure comports with due process without offering
that evidentiary hearing in every case.
I can conceive of certain cases where the judge
would order an «evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION: Well, then- you say you don’t — at this
hearing, after the initial seizure, to which you think the
defendant xs entitled to, you’re suggesting that the plaintiff
nesdn*t show anything other than what he’s already shown in an

21

affidavit or —
MR. BUSNER:

In most cases. I can't build specific

models* but I should think if the defendant came forward with
some compelling evidence* which would demonstrate that the
plaintiff's initial showing was not correct* or created a
substantial doubt with respect to that* that the plaintiff
would have to come forward.

And that often happens on these

motions in the State courts.
.QUESTION: The big difference is;* as I understand it*
the post-attachment hearing is an adversary hearing* at which
the defendant may be present and take part.
\
\

Me makes the
'

motion.
MR. BUSNER; That is correct.
QUESTION:
MR. BUSNER:

But a pre-attachment hearing is ex parte.
That's correct* Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: That's the big difference* isn't it?
MR. BUSNER: Yes* Mr. Justice.
QUESTION: So that there is the possibility* the
opportunity* depending on the facts and circumstances* to have
an evidentiary hearing after the attachment.
MR. BUSNER; That is true in New York, the opportunity
is there.
i

QUESTION:
QUESTION;

Right.

I just wanted to make that clear.

So he would at least have a chance to

come in and say* "Look- you've made an awful mistake, a very bad

22

mistake; your computer has blown a fuse or something."

But

certainly it would be no time to resolve differences in — in —
differences in conflict over the evidence?
MR. BUSTIER;
QUESTION;
MR. BUSNER:

Correct.
Yes.
You don't have the opportunity in New

Yorkf I suggest, any more than in Louisiana, to have a plenary
trial of the underlying controversies, and I believe Mitchell
was clear on that point, that a plenary trial resolving the merits
or the controversies between the parties is just not necessary
for ““ before property is taken.

That the issues can be

narrow.
Thank yoi2.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Greenwald.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. SETH GREENWALD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CAREY, ET AL.
MR. GREENWALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The importance of the question on this appeal is
rather obvious, certainly to the State of New York, because
it brings into issue the types of situations where the
provisionsal remedy of attachment is proper and constitutional.
Basically, of course, the remedy of attachment is an ex parte
order.
And this type of order, this ex parte type of order,

23
has been a matter of frequent concern to this Court in the past
several years»
In fact, this is the fourth time, I think, within the
last three or four years that this type of issue has come
before this Court.
And I think we have to ask ourselves;

In what

circumstances, preliminary relief can be granted ex parte
in a manner in accord with the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?
And of course : while the broad outlines are available ,
in this area, and most recently in Mitchell v, VI. T. Grant, and
North Georgia v. Di-Chem, many of the specifics are still in
doubt and the subject of much discussion.
I think the lower court decision and order in this
instant case is a demonstration of the confusion that exists
in this area.
Now, I think we should consider the basic rule or
basic procedure that sequestrations, as in Louisiana in the
Mitchell case, and attachments issue ex parte, and it’s also
clear that the fact at issue, ex parte, is constitutional.
And that the mere postponement of judicial inquiry
is not a violation of due process.
however, I also recognize that there are safeguards
:

:;rv

' v

. i- p

.

■ : ■ qu:-: is.r v »

And in this regard -the Mitchell case is an example

24
of some of those safeguards, or what type of safeguards are
sufficient.
But due process, of course, is not inflexible.
On the other hand, I'd say, at the other end of the
spectrum, the decision in Di~Cherq is an example of what is
absolutely unacceptable.
Now, as to the purpose of attachment, I think there's
no dispute that New York has a sufficient purpose for granting
attachments in this area, which are basically fraud.
But that is a security aspect.

Of course, there is

another aspect, jurisdiction, which is not involved in the
decision here.
But, as I say, we are dealing with the security
type of attachment.
This is where the State seeks to protect the ultimate
collectibility of a judgment, rather than to assert its
jurisdiction in the first instance.
And, of course, in New York, these; type of security
attachments are only allowed in certain specified instances?
they are not available in every lawsuit.

You can?t, just be-

cause you have a lav/suit, get an attachment or seek one.
And I would further state that it is a point for the
Legislature to determine, that you need the remedy of attachment
in this broad situation.

Fraud, of course, is a pernicious vice.

And it always has been a concern, I think, to any — to the

25
courts and the Legislature*
Now, in the court judgment opinion below, they seem
to make a finding that because the attaching party in the
instant case did not have a vendor’s lien, that it only had a
claim of fraud,that it also had some evidence that assets
were being

secreted or taken out of the State, that attachment

shouldn’t be necessary.
I submit that in view of the legitimate purpose of
the attachment in the instant case, that finding or determina­
tion is in error.

Because it basically prevents a State from

ever protecting its citizens against this type of

fraud situa­

tion.
I would also submit that it’s an unduly narrow
reading of the holding of Mitchell v. W. T. Grant, or the tenor
of that decision.

And I would also submit that this view that

it’s a narrow reading of Mitchell was confirmed by the ~ this
Court's opinion in the Di-Chem case, where the Georgia
attachment or garnishment statute was struck down, and the
matter of a vendor's lien was not even mentioned? never
mentioned once.
Thus, I think it still remains the rule, as was many
years stated, that it is for the Legislature to determine what
circumstances an attachment: shall be granted, and of course
it’s for the court to decide whether the facts of any particular
case warrant the remedy of attachment.

26
Now, as I have noted,, the prevention of fraud is an
important State interest,, This was even recognised in the case
of Fuentes v. Shevin, as one of its exceptions to that, the
prior assertion of State power ex parte.
And I submit that this assertion by the State of its
interest in the prevention of fraud or secretion of assets or
rendering uncollectible judgments should be upheld by this
Court in the instant case.
Because, as in Mitchell, it avoid self-help.

If you

don't have this remedy available, you will have instances of
self-help? and since, by the way, this is a commercial case,
it does facilitate commerce.
>

Nov/, I wish to emphasize that while we do have the
question of fraud, there's a great deal of importance to be
placed upon the fact that in Mew York a judge issues the writ
of attachment.

There is judicial supervision at every step

of -the way.
Now, I think it’s important to note — and this Court
has placed emphasis on the judicial function — it's not just
that a judge is a. more powerful official than a clerk, or a
neutral official, it's rather, and I emphasize this, that he
can exercise discretion.

He can determine whether there is a

course of action, whether there are evidentiary facts to
support the remedy.
In New York, indeed, even if the papers formally

27

support the granting of the writ of attachment, a judge, in his
discretion, can still refuse to grant that writ.

It’s not

just simply plugging in the numbers in New York and getting
your writ of attachment.

That’s quite different fronmany other

States. I submit it’s quite different, even, from Louisiana
statutes, or the facts of the Louisiana -Mitchell case.
QUESTION:

You don't just hand the affidavit to the

judge and he automatically signs it?
MR. GREENWM.D:

Absolutely not.

Indeed, the facts of

tliis case, as I understand them, are that my co-counsel, who is
the attorney for the private party, went up to Justice Fine
with his affidavits and further papers — and I might add, he
was then sent back for further proof or evidence.
didn’t go once and get the writ of attachment.
produce more.

He just

He had to

The judge would not sign this order of

attachment without even more.
There are no standard forms in New' York — we have
form book publishers , I dare say -- -there are no standard
forms in New York for checking the boxes and getting a writ of
attachment.

I have seen examples of such forms in other States

for getting writs of attachment.

Indeed, I feel that — it’s

rather obvious in the Mitchell Louisiana situation ~ that you
have the standard points asserted and you will get your
sequestration.

Rut that is definitely not the case in New York.

QUESTION;

Mr. Greenwald, ---

28

QUESTION:

How often in your practice have you

ever had an application turned down?
MR a GREENWALD:

I would say I have never — I have

never made an application for writ of attachment.

I’m in the

Attorney General’s office? we don’t practice, generally,
commercial law •— or at least my section doesn’t.

I’m sorry.

But I think my co-counsel, Mr. Rusnerf has stated
that it has happened to him, I believe.

It does happen.

But

that's —
QUESTION? Does the record show -that it happens, or
are you making just a general statement?
MR. GREENWALD:

I’m just making a general statement

It’s not part of the record.
QUESTION:

Mr. Greenwald, could I get off one point?

I’m not clear as to just exactly how you move to
— when the attachment is made, how you move to vacate, and
just what — I mean, what grounds are there for it?
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Well, —

Under the New York law.

MR. GREENWALD:

— Mr. Justice Marshall, under the

New York law, as soon as the defendant learns of the attach­
ment, he can immediately move, under CPLR 6223, to vacate
that, attachment.
QUESTION: Well, what —
MR. GREENWALD:

The grounds under which he can move

29
are as broad as the grounds upon which the attachment was
granted*

He can challenge that there is a cause of action.

He can challenge whether there is sufficient evidentiary
facts there.

He can raise factual issues.

He can also — and

this is a final ground --- he can also state that the security
is unnecessary to tile plaintiff.
Now, that last point, which was the district court’s
conclusion as the only ground, led to an inference that while
the grounds of the attachment might not have been proven, if
it was still necessary to the security of the plaintiff, that
the attachment would stand.

And that is error.

I submit that

is fundamental error, because there are other grounds.
It was the basis of the lower court’s decision that
you really didn't get a meaningful hearing or opportunity to
vacate the attachment in New York.
QUESTION:

Well, what you’ve mentioned, all of

these grounds,- are they in the statute or is it general?
That's what confuses me.
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, all of these grounds are

matters of judicial interpretation.
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. GREENWALD: This case does involve a great deal -QUESTION;

Would that be a hearing?

MR. GREENWALD: What?
QUESTION:

Would there be a hearing?

MR. GREENWALD:

Yas , this could ~

QUESTION: Would there be an evidentiary hearing?
MR. GREENWALD:

In the proper circumstances, yes,

there would be an evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION:

You'd have to make some kind of a showing

to get an evidentiary hearing, I guess.
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes, of course.

You'd have to make

that if the point that you make is the factual question,
you would gat with live witnesses.
Now, the example I’d like to give is when you make
that unnecessary to the security of the plaintiff grounds,
that is basically on jurisdictional attachments.
The defendant would say, for example, ■— and I have
a case cited in my brief, I think, Maltrejean in the appellate
division

that "I’m a national corporation.

of dollars in assets.
in the case.

I have millions

I’m not going any place.

I’ve appeared

You have jurisdiction."

Factually, you don’t need this security.
Now, of course, if the plaintiff wanted to challenge
this point, he could bring in his witnesses.

But the point is

there are factual issues oftentimes involved, but normally in
New York, as my co-counsel has said, it is a matter of legal
argument by attorneys.
QUESTION:

One last question on that:

same judge usually hear it?

Does the

Or does he go on the regular

31
motions calendar?
MR. GREENWALD:
Calendar.

It will go on the regular motions

In New York County,, where the writ of attachment

was issued here, it was a special — what the judge, the ex
parte judge signs the attachment and orders to show cause —
excuse me, just attachment and issues the writ; and if you make
a motion to vacate, it goes on the regular litigated motions
part, and another judge will normally hear it.
In smaller counties, -QUESTION:

Oh, well, that’s different.

MR. GREENWALD:

—■ if it’s done very quickly, the

same judge would hear it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Greenwald, do I correctly understand

that the motion to vacate may, in some circumstances, not
carry with it a general appearance by the defendant; whereas,
in some situations, it would be a general appearance?
MR. GREENWALD:

I think in some circumstances it

might not be a general appearance.
QUESTION:

And is it

I think the statute indicates

that it can be made without entering a general appearance.
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes.

That’s jurisdictional

And, once again, we’renot involved with that in

this case.
QUESTION:

I was wondering if there’s any difference

in the scope of the grounds which may be asserted for vacating

32
the attachment as between the two kinds of motions»
MR. GREENWALD: Well# I think you’d normally get into
factual issues more frequently with jurisdictional attachments#
such as# you get a jurisdictional attachment because the
defendant is a non-resident.

He may assert the fact that he

is a resident# and then you have a factual issue:

Is or is he

not a resident?
The point to the matter is# as far as this fraud type
attachment# the defendant is or is about to or has secreted
assets# and while this may be an ultimate factual issue# there
have been avidantiary facts submitted on the ex parte applica­
tion to support this inference? and# once again# I emphasize
that on the motion to vacate you're not trying the complete
cause of action; you’re not trying the defendant’s defenses
to the cause of action.

And I would submit also it’s quite

clear that this is the same situation as in a Louisiana
Mitchell motion to vacate in hearing.

You’re not trying the

defenses»
QUESTION: Do you agree with your colleague that the
district court misread the New York — applicable New York
laws to what is open on the motion to vacate the attachment?
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes# it most certainly has misread

the applicable New York law.

And I wish to emphasize to this

Court, that in the area of what is the law of the State of
New York# it is the courts of the State of New York that state

33
that law.
And most clearly

because this has never really been

in issue in the State of Mew York ~~ since the lower court
decision hers, as has been stated, any number of State courts
have stated that the law of the State of New York is otherwise
than the lower court said it was.
And, indeed, the point of abstention has been raised
previously, and I believe there was some issue of whether it
should be the abstention to get an interpretation of Mew York
State law, or the Younger type abstention.
The lower court determined, No. 1, that it didn't
have to abstain as to what Mew York law was, because it was
positive it was clear.
Of course, the more positive a person is, the more
frequently, 1 submit, he's in error1
And that was evidenced by the fact that leading
f

New York commentators, leading Mew York judges, New York
State court judges said: "Gee whiz, that's just not -the law
of the State of New York.”
And I think it's —
QUESTION:

I thought they said that the State —

the State was a party at that point, or not?
MR. GREENWALD: Well, the State ~ the Attorney
General's office has been a party to this case since its
very inception.

Yes.

QUESTION?

Now,, abstention would just be staying 'the

federal action until any State lav? issues would be settled.
MR. GREENWALD:

No# I submit it was different.

Basically I am now arguing also for a Younger type abstention.
QUESTION?

Oh# you’re talking about a dismissal# so

that all the issues, including the federal issues# could be
settled in the pending State court decision?
MR. GREENWALD;

That is quite correct# because it

might very well not be necessary.

And# frankly# I did not

push it because at that time the case of Huffman v. Pursue

abstention only applied solely to criminal cases.
But the three—judge court opinion,, in a footnote -~
I think it's footnote — one of the last footnotes

stated

the single judge has already decided that this is not a
proper case to abstain.

And, by the way, the same judge who

MR. GREENWALD:

You don’t have to disagree.

basically limited to final judgments.

It is

It only gets these

issues after a final judgment# and whether an attachment ever

Indeed# I’d say the only
QUESTION;

Just that the Court of Appeals 1acks

jurisdiction in this circumstance, or that ordinarily it won’t
exercise it.

Which?

37
MR. GREENWALD:

It, itself, under the statute, I

believe, lacks jurisdiction.

It is possible that the appellate

division itself could certify the question.

But that is a very

rare ci rcums tance.
And, indeed, the appellate divisions can pass on
questions of fact and law, the exercise of discretion by that
judge.

You even, besides getting a motion to vacate, you get

an appeal in New York.

MR. GREENW/iLD:

MR. GREENWALD:

No, 15 m not going to say they,

quote, ‘'misread them"? but also, as Justice, then Judge Cardozo
said in the Zenith case in the New York Court of Appeals,
against Bathing Pavilion, attachments are not for the asking,
there must be evidence, there must ba proof.

Which is the

statement of the general premise.
When an attachment case got up to the New York Court
of Appeals, it was purely on a question of the jurisdiction to
grant that attachment in the first place? a matter of law,
not a question of the facts.
The New York Court of Appeals is called a court of
law, it doesn’t judge the facts.

The facts are determined, or

can be modified, say, by the appellate division? but once that
case gets up to the New York Court of Appeals, the only way
the Court of Appeals can change that judgment is to say, as a
matter of law, on a very strong showing that the law was
applied wrongly below, say, vacate that attachment.

41
Indeed, I think it was Waifs on v. Russian Republic,
they said, this is going to be attached because — this
attachment is going to be vacated because the Russian Soviet
Republic isn’t —
QUESTIONj Well, aren’t you just ~~ all you’re really
telling us, I gather, is that the three-judge court simply, as
you said earlier, misread New York law.
o
You’re not familiar with the Hilecki case in this

Court, are you?

That happened to be a case in which the

Second Circuit read New Jersey lav?, as expressed in the opinion
of the New Jersey Supreme Court, in a way that was clearly
wrong; and yet this Court said it couldn’t review it.

And

the reason I felt distrust about it was -that I wrote the
opinion for the New Jersey Supreme Court when I was a member
of that Court.
And I knew how wrong it was.
MR. GREENWALD:

Well, let me put it this —

QUESTION: But yet this Court would not review the
holding of the Second Circuit as to what New Jersey law was.
MR. GREENWALD:

But let me put it this way;

We have

in this case a statute of the State of New York that’s been
declared unconstitutional, on ’the basis that you do not have
a meaningful opportunity to vacate an attachment under New
York law.
Now- this flowed primarily, as we say, from an

42
erroneous ruling of New York law.

I think that certainly this

Court does have jurisdiction to decide that -the New York
statute* viewed as a whole

- and that is the basic test in

this area --- viewed as a whole is a constitutional statute.
It’s not an ancient statute.
QUESTION:

It's a matter of the 1963

Yet your colleague agrees, as I understood

him when he answered Mr. Justice White, if the three--judge
court properly stated New York lav?, -then its judgment was
correct.
MR. GREENWALD: Well. I would explain that —- and I'm
not trying to back away -— because if the only ground you could
vacate an attachment on in the State of New York was that it was
unnecessary to the security of the plaintiff, that would mean
that, while the plaintiff has not proven his grounds, the
attachment would still stand because it might be necessary to
security.
And on that basis, of course, you would not have a
meaningful hearing ox- a meaningful opportunity to vacate that
attachment.

But that is simply not. the case.

It's obviously not

the case. We do give —•• we have a judge granting the writ in
the first place, he's exercising discretion.
move to vacate that attachment.

You can immediately

You go once again back to a

judge who exercises his discretion as to whether that writ
should be granted, should have been granted.

There is no

43
doubt in my mind that the issues on that motion to vacate the
attachment are as broad as the issues that it originally came
up on tine ex parte application.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but what if they aren’t?

What if they aren't?
How about the answer to Mr, Justice Brennan’s question,
if the issue is as limited on the motion as the three-judge
court said it was, or that they were, do you agree with your
colleague?
MR. GREENWALD:

Not necessarily, because this Court

has said a limitation on litigable issues is not a denial of
due process.

That was Lindsey v. Normet.

A court or a pro­

cedure can limit the number of issues that you can litigate
*

at any particular time.
Once again, we have emphasized -that we have, I think,
a statute that fully comports with due process.

It is; 'the

necessary statute.
I would also —.ticijie final point;

the three-judge

court made something about the fact that fraud was perhaps
not as amenable to proof as a vendor's lien.
Well, assuming this is —this may be the case —
and, by the way, the appellees and the arhicus curiae seem to
be at odds on this issue — it's" 'really insufficient reason
to eliminate all prejudgment attachments involving allegations
of fraud.

44

We certainly have the counterbalancing interest of
the State»
And once again you have the situation where a judge
determines the issues, he exercises his discretion, and, at
this point, I would like to reserve my remaining time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Ledes»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. LEDES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LEDES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think I should devote the first two minutes to
removing this word and phrase, "fraud", from the discussion
once and for all.
At page 55a of this Appendix is the agreement in the
form prepared by Curtis.

It is their form.

It was prepared

in their office by their employees, -typed by them, and the
publisher is Champion Sports.
Significantly, it has no date.
It was signed on the back side by Mr. Bert Sugar, on
behalf of Champion Sports.
Not knowing when this contract was signed, we have a
great course of fraud being conducted here, and we are at a
loss to understand how we, in this ex parte proceeding and then

45
undes: 6223, can now address ourselves in affidavits and
answer and take on this challenge, because, in spite of what
my brothers have said, they have not cited a case —• not one
isolated, singular case — and it is not the law of New York
conclusively? there is no right to a hearing and evidence.
There is no right to adversary hearing.
The Court of Appeals of New York has said it three
times.

Only one case was mentioned in their brief, and I

might point out that the reference to the Zenith case was in
the reply brief, and it was the dictum of Hr. Justice Cardozo,
the finding of the case, and the simple finding, was that
there was no statement of a cause of action as against
defendants B, C, D and E by

simple implication of allegations

made against A.
You could hold A, but you can't hold B, C .and D
with a jurisdictional defect.
That was the decision.
Of course, Mr. Justice Cardoso took the opportunity
of writing some lovely words about the care of the courts.
It wasn’t the finding of the court.
American Reserve Insurance, many years later,
certainly made it very clear that the finding in Zenith was
correct --- -two years later, I believe it. was — no, two years
before, Wulfsohn made the rule.
Wulfsohn

The rule was clear in

46
Jurisdictional defects in 6223 are not set forth,,
but it is an inherent right that -- we've got to remember
Article 62 was a creation of the Legislature.

What we did

inherit in the body of law in the Thirteen States was certain
basic common-law principles.

And one of these common-law

principles was the right to move against a complaint for
failure to state a cause of action, the jurisdictional
reasons.
In its interpretation of 6223, the New York Court of
Appeals has three cases:

Wulfsohn, Zenith and Arnerican Reserve.

And my brothers, in answer to your questions, only cited
Zenith for the dictum.
Rut, be that as it may, I knew of no compelling
reason why the other two cases weren't cited.
But I'd like to continue my argument on this minor
element of fraud, and when we refer to a person here as Mr.
Sugar as a substantial person, in the reply brief of the
Attorney General a most interesting statement was made.

At

page. 5, impact on the debtor, the appellees are utterly
nonsensical here.
If Sugar is, quote, ”a most substantial citizen",
end quote, then he should be able to discharge the attachment
CPLR 6222, the bonding provision..
The instant action involves a commercial transaction.
The commercial transaction did not involve Mr. Sugar, according

to their document, except as a signatory.

And I might point

out that 55a in the Appendix, the contract, has no representa­
tions or warranties of ownership as a mandatory condition to
the distribution arrangement; and it has that mystical last
statement we lawyers prepare in one form or another, "This

this is a constitutionally cognisable interest.
I base my logic in this matter before the Court, on a
basic four-point theory:
The cognizable interest? -the duality of the interest

was the process.

Your Honor, the issue here is how I could get info

I don’t want

to go into the deprivations that have taken place here on my
client, because it deals with my point later on on bonding»
Your Honor, it was stated, I believe, by Mr» Justice
Blackraun, in pointing out the bonding question that was involved
in Di^Chem.

Fidelity of Baltimore is the, one of the leading

bonding companies in this practice that we're engaged in,
I approached them several times and they said a bond
would be readily available if we would deposit with them
securities with an adequate margin over the principal amount,
ox* a savings account passbook in the full amount.
And,

one of the two, my client did- that is, we wouldn’t have been

point out, Your Honor, that the money is not Champion's, it's
Wrestling Revue*s.
Wrestling Revue is in by virtue of this Tinkers-toEvans-to-”Chance type of px*actice we have in New York»

You see,

under this rule the transaction wasn't, as in Di-Chem,
Company A selling to Company B.
Company C, who was due to receive the money, and
hadn't received it as yet

under a contract of sale, was wrapped

into the deal by the allegations of fraud and deceit.

garnishment

we had the same situation in Fuentes.

in that hearing, do you think, when the hearing is held, do
you think that the other side, the plaintiff in the case,
should have to show anything more than what he's already shown

MR. LEDES:

With respect to Wrestling, yes? with

respect to Champion, upon which the Wrestling situation,
exists, there must be shown at least some clear, concise
and final -■» final numbers, Your Honor.

Because when they

attached, they attached for 28,000, and we have a statement in

a substantial man, it’s not 'that he’s substantial— he's
substantial in the community.
If I took the Attorney General’s statement and took
it in reverse and asked the question:

If he wasn’t substantial,

would he not be entitled to due process?
They infer that if he had money, let him go bond it.
If he doesn’t have money, which is the interpretation — the way

Iall go

In New York, Your Honor, there are -- this,

what was enacted here under 6223 is most intriguing, and I
didn*t take it up in my brief, but it*s simple logic.
*

In New York we have a motion for summary judgment,
and we have a motion also available to us to dismiss -the
action for failure to state a cause of action.
These motions are not statutory, they came down with
/

us 20Q-sorne-odd years ego.

Two hundred, to be precise.

Wa inherited this right.

These are motions that#

strangely enough, were not expanded upon when they gave the
statutory right to garnish.

In fact, it was constricted.

Those very motions were constricted.
If you read 6223, there is a provision in 6223 that
is most interesting.

In 6223, the provision states very clearly

that the court must mandatorily give the plaintiff an
opportunity to correct the defect.
In effect, 6223 took from us 'the statutory -- not the

58
statutory , the inherent right to attack, if we can —
QUESTION:

Weil, you aren't —* are you saying there’s

a constitutional right to prevent somebody from amending their
complaint?

That’s nonsense.
MR. LEDES:

No, no, Your Honor.

Mo, Your Honor.

The garnishment statutes — what I’m saying is the garnishment
statutes took the standard that pre-existed, it didn’t, open up
an opportunity, as has been argued, for an adversary hearing.
There isn’t, a case in this whole file that talks about
adversary hearings.
In fact, 6223 took from us what we had under ~ I
think it was 3002 or 3112

it took from us the right to

strike for failure to state a cause of action, because under6223, on which we could collect damages, we had to give up
something.

They apparently thought we should — the motion --

the part —’6223 is inapplicable, unusable, because it gives
you -the opportunity of correcting the plaintiff’s defects.
Because the statute specifically says that upon the motion ----meaning 6223 — the court shall give the plaintiff a reasonable
opportunity to correct any defect.
QUESTION: And you say that’s unconstitutional.
That has nothing to do with your case, of course.
MR. LEDESs

No, I’m — no, what I’m simply saying,

0

Your Honor, it makes 6223

the creation of a right by the

Legislature, we didn't need, because we had this right before

59

t.o vacate, by pulling the rug — the complaint — out from
under -die attachment.
But they put 6223. probably, prophetically to think
some 75 or 80 years later 1 would be arguing here, so that
someone could argue we have a right to a hearing.

We had the

right to that hearing back in those days.
This so-called hearing is a gag.
In New York the cases are unambiguously clear, and
the cases they cite, most of which I have referred to in my
brief, deal with jurisdictional points.
In Maitrejean there was a failure —

Levon

Properties — which is a lower, it’s an appellate division
case — dismissed, it didn't — it failed to establish a
prima facie casecf any intent to defraud.

At pag©

Thompson, set forth a rule that all orders of attachment must
provide that the plaintiff* within three days after levy*
shall move on notice to the defendant* the garnishee and the
sheriff for leave to prove the grounds upon which the order of
attachment was issued»
The burden of proof on such a motion is on the
plaintiff* and the attachment will be deemed vacated if such a

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS CAREY* ET AL.
MR. GREENWALDs

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice.

I would make the brief observation that certainly
my adversary would have been making a fine presentation to the
litigated motion part of New York State Supreme Court* New
York County* when he was arguing about whether there was fraud
in this case or whether there wasn*t fraud in this case* or
whether the allegations were sufficient* and the like.
I think* though* that we should recognize that this
is the United States Supreme Court* and it should fo® emphasized
that basically this is a particular law based upon the
unconstitutionality of 'the State statute.

And we should

always keep that in mind.
Now* I have been informed* by the way* when there was
a question of adversary hearings* of the case «*- X think it
wis a famous .case a few years ago* called Lily Pons* a matter
involving the singer Lily Pons.
/

And .it was an adversary hearing on. residency* which

was a jurisdictional attachment* for example.
Once again* X think Your Honors; have all recognized
•that residency is a factual issue*

S9
But what seems to be mistaken here is that when we're
dealing with questions of fraud* there's basically a compelling
State interest to put the funds into an* in effect* escrow»
And* mind you, in New York, under this attachment* the funds
don't go to the plaintiff* they're kept by the sheriff.

To

keep these funds available»
This is* I believe* differing generally from the
sequestration situation.
And there isn’t this compelling necessity to have a
fraud attachment* the concomitant that at the very institution
of the suit you cannot expect the plaintiff to prove his case
of fraud in toto , there is no question to conviee the judge to
sign that order ex parte* or to convince him to deny the motion
to vacate the attachment.

You're going to have to have some

evidentiary facts* something more than a mere scintilla*
something more than suspicion or surmise.
It definitely, I think* is clear from the Naif York
cases that you do get. a genuine hearing* it may be legal* it
may be factual.

motion to vacate is entitled to an evidentiary hearing?
MR. G3REENWALD;

Well* I think idle most recant case

I'm not going to say the strongest case — is* of course* the

70

exposition in Regna 11 v, 'Page, which I put in as an appendix
to my brief — that’s the brief for Carey and -QUESTION:

You were asked for the strongest case.

MR. GREEHWALD:

The strongest case?

Well , I 'think that — it is not a matter of whether
a case is strong or weak., the fact of the matter is there are
certain circumstances in which an evidentiary hearing is
provided.
You have to realize that in the instant case, the
defendant, Mr. Sugar, never moved to vacate that attachment.
You don't have before you anything in this record to know what
type of hearing you would have gotten.

He just ignored the

hearing in the State court, he came running into federal court.
QUESTION:

Let me change the question.

Is there a

New York case prior to the decision of the three-judge court
that sheds any light on this?
MR. GREENWALD: Well, I did mention, of course, the
fact — I think what was described as — mentioned to me,
the Lily Pons case.
I think also — and I forget, it was an appellate,
second department,, one of the cases in; ray brief, it involved
a national corporation that had been attached.

And, mind you,

— and they showed the evidence, it was unnecessary — it was
determined that the attachment was unnecessary for the
security of the plaintiff.

71
New, rrdnd you, I don't know if there was an
evidentiary hearing. The basic point is that at the time of
moving to vacate that attachment in New York, you’re not going
to be trying the case, you’re not going to be trying the
question of —> as a matter of law, was there fraud?

You’re

simply determining whether that judgment, ex parte

not

judgment, ex parte writ was issued properly.
QUESTION;

Again, what case says that?

I mean,'you*ve given us all this area of what
goes on, but, I mean, what case do you have?
MR. GREENWALD; Well, I think —• I can’t offhand —
QUESTION;

I think that's what my brother Stevens

is trying to get.
MR. GREENWALD;

— state what case, and I think

that’s important.
QUESTION; Well, don’t you feel obliged to find one?
MR. GREENWALD;

Well, let me put it til is way,

Justice Marshall, the fact of the matter is that, these were
not issues in the State of New York, until this three-judge
court opinion and judgment came down.

It was not considered a

problem in the State of New York, as to what happens here or
what happens there.
Oh, excuse me, I have been pointed to the case of
Eaton Factors, which discusses about the stand in fraudulent
intent.

72

QUESTION:

Where is that?

QUESTION: What page of the brief is that on?
MR. GREENWALDs

I think that’s on page 30 — 26 of

the Curtis brief.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Thank yon, gentleman.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:15 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
