ORAL ARGUMENT OF MYRON C. BAUM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAUMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

-the

Courts
This case arises on certiorari to the District of
Columbia Circuit, and presents, one® again, the problem which
this Court has dealt with in its preceding two tarmsj namely,
injunctions against the assessment and collection of taxes,
and the prohibition against such injunctions which is contained
in Section 7421 of the Internal Revenue Cede.
This Court dealt with it two years ago in Bob Jones
University and Americans United.

It dealt with it several years

earlier in Williams Packing, and briefly again last term in
Amsrlcan Friends. Service Committee.
The Court of Appeals on the vary same day on which
this Court announced its opinio® in Bob Jcnes University and
Americans United, reversed a decision of the District Court
«■NSHBsraMftVB

«tfesagswawae»*feaasfi&P iSV»

for the District of Columbia, dismissing this complaint for
injunction, and held that the case should be remanded for a
hearing at which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue would be

4
required to make a factual submission as to the basis for the
tax assessment hare involved, and in which the respondent tax­
payer would be permitted discovery.
Th® Commissioner sought reharing on the basis of this
Court*s opinion in Bob Jonas University and amaricans United,
but the Court of Appeals refused to modify its decision and,
accordingly, we sought and obtained certiorari.
The controversy arises in the following circumstances;
Mr* Shapiro is a citizen of Israel, who cam® to the United
States in 1970*

At soma time in that year, or shortly there­

after, he was indicted in Israel for securities fraud, and the
Government of Israel requested th® Government of the United
States to permit his extradition.
The question of his extradition was litigated in th©
District Court for th© Southern District of New York and in the
Court of Appeals for th© Second Circuit.

Both Courts held that

Mr. Shapiro was ©xtradictable, and ordered his surrender*
He then filed a petition for certiorari with this
Court..

While that petition was pending, Mr. Shapiro negotiated

an agreement, with the State of Israel, under which he would with**
draw his petition and would surrender for extradition if the
State of Israel would allow him to remain hare until his then
unborn child was born, and would allow him to remain on bail
until his trial in Israel*
The petition for certiorari in this Court from that

5
extradition was then withdrawn, and Mr» Shapiro was scheduled
to surrender for extradition on December 2, 1973.
On December 6 of that year, three days earlier,-, the
Commissioner, upon learning from the Immigration and Naturaliza­
tion Service that this extradition was to take place, and pursu­
ing an investigation which had begun in September of ’73,
issued a jeopardy assessment against Mr® Shapiro for income
taxes amounting to approximately $7,000 for the year 1970 and
$85,000 for the year 1971, and levied on somfi bank accounts
maintained by Mr» Shapiro, which represented some but not all
of his property.
This, of course, was a recognition of the fact that
had Mr, Shapiro been allowed to depart, the bank accounts would
have also departed, and there would have been no funds avail­
able to the United States to collect taxee which it believed to

b@ due.
At tills point 1 think it appropriate to point out
th®'- procedure for these assessments s

Normally, in income tax

cases, the Commissioner, if he determines a deficiency is due
from a taxpayer, must, under the Coda, issue a statutory notice
of deficiency, which provides that within ninety days thereafter
the taxpayer may file a petition for review in the Tax Court
of the United States»
This is the 'procedure described in Section 6212 and
6213 of th© Internal

Revenue Code, which appear in the appendix

6
to our brief»
If he does not follow that procedure, the statute
expressly provides that, he may b© enjoined.

But Section 6213

contains an express exceptiont namely, for a jeopardy assessment
under Section 6861.
That section provides that if the Commissioner
believes that the assessment ©r collection of a deficiency may
be in jeopardy, he shall, notwithstanding the provision.;'; of
Section 6213, immediately assess such deficiency.
If he does this before a notice ©£ deficiency has been
issued, the statute further provides that he must issue & notice
of deficiency within sixty days of that assessment»
Thus, in jeopardy assessments, the procedure is
essentially reversed.

The assessment comes first, and the

notice of deficiency comas second.
QUESTION*

Mr. Baum, —

MIL BAUM3

Yes, Mr. Justice?

QUESTION $

'*•*“ bring me up to date on the facts about

Mr. Shapiro.

Is he back in this country?

MR* BAUM?,

He is in Israel now, Your Honor.

QUESTION?

Has he been tried over there?

MR. BAUMs

He has not been tried as far as we are

QUESTIONS

Is ho free on bond over there?

MR. BAUMs

He’s £r@® -on bond.

aware.

7
This was represented in the district court by. counsel
for Mr» Shapiro.
Section 6861 also provides that notice and demand for
payment shall be made by the Commissioner in the case of a
jeopardy assessment without, waiting the ten days which we have
found to exist in other statutes.
The taxpayer hag raised the point in brief* and he
raised it below, that Mr, Shapiro never did receive notice.
This is contradicated, however, by the affidavit of a Revenue
Service Center official who was responsible for the mailing of
the notice, and a copy of that affidavit is printed at pages
10a and 11a of Respondents' brief.
QUESTION:

At what stage of the proceedings was that

affidavit filed, Mr. Baum?
MR. BAUM:

After the* decision of the Court of

Appeals, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION: This is one thing that kind of raises some
problems for me about the case, is that:

Are we entitled to

consider, in reviewing the judgment of th€i Court of Appeals,
proceedings that transpired after the judgment of the Court of
Appeals in the District Court?
MR. BAUM:

I'd like to say, in response to that, if

Your Honor pleas®, that the proceedings in the District Court
were dismissed before any question was raised about the non­
receipt of the notice.

The non-receipt of notice came in the

subsequent proceedings# and it is placed in issue by counsel
before the Court now.
QUESTION s So both the contention and the response
occurred in the post-Court of Appeals hearing in the District
Court?
MR. BAUM:

As far as ray best recollection is,, Your

QUESTIONS

Isn't that as it should be litigated# and

Honor„

if this case goes back it would be a point ‘that would be
litigated# wouldn't it?
MR. BAUMi

If that were all that were to fo® litigated

we would not, be here# Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

That's not ray question.

It is a matter

that should h<r litigated.
MR. BAUM:
QUESTION:

W® think w® have established it
Whenever somebody says "yes* and somebody

else says "no11# that's litigation in ray book.
MR. BAUM5

Yes# Your Honor.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, however# ~QUESTXONs

And so if this case were to proceed

without us ruling with you# that would be one of the points
that would be litigated.
MR. BAUM: There are numerous decisions# Mr. Justice
Marshall# which hold that in the case cf Internal Revenue
notices there is no statutory requirement that they be received

9
it is sufficient if there is proof that, they have been sento
This has happened any number of times in the Tax Court because
©f these statutory notices, and we submit that we have
established in 'the usual fashion and in the fashion required by
*

the Federal Rules that it. was mailed in due course.
Indeed, a copy of -the notice appears in taxpayer’s
brief, at the following pages.’
however, says

12a and 13a.

And taxpayer,

the form says "Taxpayer1s Copy”.

It says

’'Taxpayer’s Copy” because he has failed to take into account
the computerisation of -the Revenue Service.
The Revenue Service file copy is a piece of magnetic
tape, and the only way the Service can reproduce a document is
to push the appropriate button, if that be the device, on the
machine and it will printout on the form which has printed on
it, "Taxpayer’s Copy”, because they do not made® copies for
themselves, they have the permanerit magnetic tape.
In accordance with the prescribed procedure, the
Commissioner issued a statutory notice of deficiency to this
taxpayer within fifteen days *— not sixty — but within fifteen
days, on December 21, 1973.

And shortly thereafter, on

January 3, 1974, Mr. Shapiro filed his petition in the Tax
Court of the United States.

That petition is still pending,

■and is awaiting trial.
And that is a factor which distinguishes this css®
from your prior decisions where there was no Tax Court petition

10

pending.
In the meantime, however, he filed this action for
an injunction on December 13th in the District Court for the
District ©f Columbia, seeking to have the levies removed and
also seeking to have his extradition stayed.

The latter part

has been disposed of in the Court of Appeals and is no longer
before this Court.

That is, the extradition.

And it was after that that he departed and returned
to Israel.
After hearings before the District Court in December
1973, and after a copy of the notice of deficiency was filed
with the Court, it dismissed the ..action for lack of jurisdic­
tion on the authority of your decision in Williams Packing Co.
But tha Court of Appeals reversed and held that that
dismissal was incorrect, because the Court should have h@Xd a
hearing at which the Commissioner would be required to coma
forward with a factual submission to determine whether there
was a rational basis for the assessment.
It also held —
QUESTION: Do you know, Mr. Baum, whether the Court of
Appeals had any precis® civil procedure type of tiling in mind?
Would it have been enough if the government had filed an answer
to tha complaint?
MR. BAUM:

I think Your Honor has asked me two ques­

tions, and I’d like to answer them in orders

The Court of

11
Appeals did not indicate exactly what procedure, in fact, in
the conclusion of its opinion, appearing on page ISa of our
Petition for Certiorari, it says;

the District Court is not

required to explore the matter in precisely the same manner as
in Lucia and Piszarello? each case is different and should be
considered on its particular facts.
Which, frankly, 1 must admit, leaves us very little
guidance,
On the second point, it is exactly what happened in
the District Court while we were considering and filing a
petition for certiorari in this proceeding that illuminates it,
because the District Court has imposed & much more onerous
burden on us than possibly even the Court of Appeals contem­
plated.

I don’t know, because I —
QUESTIONS

May I ask, Mr. Baum, in that paragraph 5,

doesn’t that — may I properly draw the inference from this
that they are talking about a probable cause hearing?
MR0 BAUM:

I didn’t hear Your Honor.

QUESTIONs

A probable cause hearing.

That the

Commissioner has to come up with some showing, from which an
instance of probable cause to levy the tax may foe inferred.
MB.. BAUM:

You could call it that, Your Honor, yes.

But 2 don’t know what a probable cause hearing is in a tax
context.
QUESTION: Well, but we’re in the context of the Rules

12
of Civil Procedure her®*. 1 take it. An action was filed se@ki.ng
injunctive relief* and that would fo© governed* would it not* by
j.

the Rules of Civil Procedure?
MR, BAUMs And the Rules of Civil Procedure* if Your
Honor pleas®* require that the taxpayer* the plaintiff* must
establish by some means that there has been some taint of
illegality in this assessment.

Instead* the whole burden has

been placed upon the government to justify its action by the
mere filing of an injunction complaint,
QUESTIONS Well* but the Rule.® of Civil Procedure
don't necessarily supplant whatever may have been said in
Enochs.
Conceivably* Enochs may mean that the government has
to file an answer in a case like this* but do you know of my
provision in the Rule® of Civil Procedure that talks about a
probable cause hearing?
MR, BAUM;

Non® at all* Your Honor,

The Court of Appeals also held that the taxpayer
had met the other test of Williams Packing* namely* the equity
jurisdiction test,

We submit that the Court of Appeals was in

error on both counts.
This Court said in Williams Packing and in Bob Jones
University that;

injunctions restraining th® assessment and

collection of taxes might not issue unless the taxpayer can
prove that it is clear that under no circumstances would th®

13
government prevail.
In ray humble opinion that goes way beyond a probable
cause requirement.

It also, of course, reiterated the necessity

for a requirement of equity jurisdiction.
And 'this is nothing but a recognition, as this court
is well aware, of the danger of a waive of injunction suits
flooding the courts and delaying the collection of taxes.
QUESTIONS

Well, isn't Mr. Chapiro*s contention here

that all of a sudden this just came like s. bolt out of the blue,
and if the government didn’t tell him why they were after him,
he had no way of evaluating their claim, or arguing that it was
baseless?
MR. BAUMs

He says that, Your Honor, but th© notice of

deficiency, which was before th® District Court and th.® Court

of Appeals, states teat for the year 1970 he had $18,000 in
unexplained bank deposits.

Under numerous decisions, of which

on© might b© O ’Dwyer vs. Coramissloner, that is sufficient to
carry the Commissioner’s burden of showing that there may be a
tax liability, and the burden is then on th® taxpayer to show
that those, that $18,000 in this case doss not represent
taxable income.
As to idle yeas? 1971, the notice of deficiency stated
expressly 'that he had $137,000-odd from narcotics transactions
in taxable income.
year 1971.

Arid a tax was imposed accordingly for th©

14
Now, 1 submit that is a — certainly he was not
completely uninformed as to the basis for the Commissioner's
actioni indeed, h® was put on ample notice of the basis for it.
In fact, the Commissioner —- the Court of Appeals, in
its opinion, says that the District Court should obtain some
evidence, to determine whether the tax was arbitrary or excessive
In ether words, the Commissioner is the one who is on
trial, and all we had before the District Court was an affidavit
accompanying a motion for a preliminary injunction, which said:
nI had no taxable income for 1970, and my 1971 tax return was
correct.n
That is far from the showing that the Commissioner
acted wholly irrationally, arbitrarily, or in any capricious
manner.
The Court has not only ignored the fact of the two­
fold test of Williams.Packing Company, and the fact that a
simple denial is not sufficient to carry the burden we imposed
on the taxpayer.
faith.

But it assumed that there was a lack of good

For lack of good faith and the necessity for speed here,

which gave rise to the aecustion of lack of good faith, was,
of course, as I said earlier, the question of imminent departure
And nothing, in any decision of this Court, supports
the view that there should be a heavier burden on the Commission
when the taxpayer brings an injunction suit than there should be
if he brought a refund suit, or filed a petition in the 'Tax

Court.
QUESTION:

Instead of responding as he did in con™

elusion terms, suppos® he had submitted a certified copy of a
final decree of his grandmother’s estate, showing that he had

substantially that amount? would you say teat would have

QUESTION: Well, it wouldn’t affect — it wouldn't,
with finality, determine all of the tax aspects either, 'would
it?
MR. BAUM;

No, it would not, Your Honor»

What is most serious to us about this case «—
QUESTION:

May I interrupt you once more?

MR» BAUM:

Yes. Sorry.

QUESTION: What bearing would it have on the jeopardy
assessment?
MR. BAUMs

It would, I think, allow the Court

perhaps some basis for coming in and saying, "Now, Mr.
Commissioner, it is incumbent upon you to examine the — to
acquaint us with the facts-underlying this case."
QUESTION:
MR. BAUM;

As a.: condition to tee continued impoundment?
That’s correct.

16

QUESTION* Where would this showing ha made?
MR. BAUM;

In the District Court.

QUESTION *

In tlie District Court.

So you. don't —

you say that it*s proper to file this suit and it’s just a —
in face of the Anti-Injunction Act# and that on® or the other
of the parties has got to show something?
MR. BAUM*

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION*

Unh-hunh.

MR. BAUM* That’s absolutely correct.
QUESTIONs

Would some of the problem that is followed

here have been saved if the government simply filed an answer
to the complaint for an injunction, outlining in very rough
form the basis for th® imposition of the tax?
MR. BAUM*

I doubt that it would, Mr,, Justice

R&hnquiat,because some of the government's evidence was based
upon confidential informants.

That would not have bean —

no details would have bean disclosed -QUESTION*

Well, under the pleadings we have now,

we you don't answer in great detail as to what witnesses will
testify, do you?

You just answer tine same way 'that you allege

in a complaint, you can be fairly cursory.
MR. BAUM* Well, I submit, that's what we did when we
filed a notice of deficiency on:the 21st of December 1973.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but procedurally in the District

Court, in stead of answering, you filed a motion to dismiss.

17
MR- BAUM:

Well, 1 don’t think that changes it, Your

Honor, that it had before it, on motion to dismiss, other
materials, even though that was the procedural framework in
which the issue arose»
Because essentially, if Your Honor pleas®, what the
Court has done is not only inverted the burden of proof, but
it has changed the forum for the resolution of tax disputes.
If 'this decision stands, any taxpayer can ignore his right to
go to the Tax Court, can ignore the possibility of refund suits,
and file an action for an injunction with a general denial that
h® owes any money»
And he is then in a position of letting the
Commissioner come forward and produce the evidence which
sustains the assessment, having the Court decide whether that
evidence is sufficient, and possibly deciding the whole merits
of the controversy in advance,
QUESTIONS

Indeed, h® can force the Commissioner to

com® forward, by discovery, under the Court ©f Appeals ruling.
MR. BAUM; That’s correct»
QUESTION?

bong before he could in the Tax Court.

QUESTION,?

This is just a qu@sti.on ©f —» what provokes

it is the fact that you’ve got his property,
MR» BAUM;
QUESTION;
can’t get it.

Well, -You have his property locked up and he

io
MR. BAUM;

Ha cannot get it, that is true, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

And — well, that makes quite a bit of
/

^

difference.
1 suppose the suit would be — he would gladly dismiss
the suit if you'd give him back his property.

And he would go

forward in the Tax Court.
And,, as the Court, of Appeals said, you ought to show
something if you’re going to hold his property.
MR0 BAUMi

But, Your Honor — if Your Honor pleas©,

this has been in existence sine© 1924, and we have been using
this statute, and the direct statutory purpose as contained in
the statute is to shorten the time, and that's why the sixtyday for giving a statutory notice of deficiency, allowing him
to go to the Tax Court — we may not sail the property, w© can
only hold it.

And having accelerated the whole statutory

scheme, that is what Congress did, and which has been upheld
many, many times.
There i,s no problem on that, and if he had mad© some
shewing, some substantial showing that there was a wholly
arbitrary tax here, or something just based upon retribution
as might be his claim, then I would understand the point. But
I see nothing when a straightforward tax assessment is made,
based upon alleged items of income, and where you are immediately
at issue as to whether those items of income are true and
correct or not, as we are in thousands of tax cases every year

19

QUESTIONs Well, at the time he filed his complaint in
the District Court; am I right in understanding that all he knew
was that he was scheduled to be deported; or, rather- extradited
in a very short time, and that the United States Government, had
seised all of his assets in the United States, and he knew
nothing else»

Isn't that right?

And that was what his complaint said,,
MR, BAUMs That is correct, except that
QUESTIONs

Wasn’t it -then incumbent upon 'the

government to file something as a pleading in that court, to
allow the District Court to apply 'the very test that this Court
has established in the Enochs case?
Otherwise, the Court would find it absolutely
impossible to do what this Court has told it it has to do? that
is f to apply a test»
MR, BAUM £ But, then, in every jeopardy case, Your
Honor, we would have bean accused of seising the man’s property
QUESTIONS

Yes,

MR, BAUMs

*»■*>• and proceeding without any basis for

him to challenge; it -QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR, BAUM s

— and he would then gat an immediate

u-

trial ~~

QUESTIONS

Ho.

You would have

it would ba

incumbent on. you to file a. pleading in the court, which is *»<-

20

that’s what is incumbent upon any defendant in any court any­
where, whan he’s sued.
That’s no discrimination against you at all.
MRo BAUMs

Well, I think that what happened here

discloses that that’s not quite true, Your Honor. We filed an
affidavit in the District Court.

The District Court says

wthat‘s wholly insufficient, we want you to bring in your
confidential informant35 —
QUESTIONt

Well, if they win on that, but that

isn't ~~ but you say that your motion to dismiss just said:
Dismiss this case because the taxpayer hasn’t carried his
burden.
MR. BAUMs That’s correct. Your Honor.
QUESTION*

Now, how can the taxpayer carry any

burden at all if he — if all he knows is that you’ve seised
his property?

And ha says, ”1 don't ow® any tax, and I have

no idea why the government thinks I owe seme tax.”
Now, maybe if the government coir.es in and says so,
says something, maybe then he has some burden, I don't know,
but
MR. BAUM a Well, that, as I submit, is what we did,
Mr. Justice White.
QUESTIONt

But it isn’t.

You filed a motion to

dismiss, which says, in effect, that the complaint dess not
state a claim.

If you’d answered, tee test might well be teat

21
unless the claimant can obtain a judgment, a motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the tiling should fo© dismissed.

But you didn’t

even answer.
MR. BAUM; We filed a motion to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction, Your Honor, which was in accordance with tills
Court's holdings, and the rules provide that on a motion to
dismiss the court may consider affidavits and other materials
in deciding the motion.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Baum.

MR. BAUMs

Yes, Mr. Justics?

QUESTION s

I don’t think you filed a definitive

affidavit until after the decision by the CADC.
MR. BAUMz

That’s correct, Your Honor*

QUESTIONS And that prompts m© to ask a question I
think was alluded to by on© of the other Justices earliers
What is before us?

granted

certiorari from the decision

and judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Your brief, and I think

the brief of your opponent, tell us about what happened
subsequently, and you’ve been speaking a good deal about what
happened subsequently.
Is there anything before us beyond the decision of
the Court, of Appeals?
MR. BAUMz

That is a very anomalous situation,

Your Honor. We have lodged with this Court the proceedings
subsequent to the Court of Appeals, because w® were in the

22
position of the District Coart refusing to await our filing
of a petition for a writ of certiorari»

The District Court

ordered us to proceed, and we had to do something, and we were
not willing to be in contempt of the District Court.
And so we are in the position of having been pro­
ceeding in two courts at once.

Ir ve never had that experience

before»
QUESTIONS Well, may I ask this?

The Court of Appeals

based its judgment on the two tests laid down in Enochs.

On®

of them was irreparable injury, because „the taxpayer was not
able to obtain bond and would ba imprisoned in Israel.

The

District Court proceeding that followed the decision of the
Court of Appeals revealed that the taxpayer is out on bail, so
now there's no irreparable injury.
Does that dispose of the case under Enochs?
•K «V2»rtW5»HWIffi»C=C>a»

ME. BAUM:

It could, Your Honor, because, we submit

that there is no longer any showing of irreparable injury.
QUESTIONs

Well, doesn't it under Enochs, and under

the decision of the Court of Appeals?
S© that brings me back tc my question:
look at?

What do we

What you say in your briefs, or what we granted

certiorari to consider?
MR. BAUM: Well, of course, we would prefer that you
look at what, you granted certiorari to consider, because we
think it’s & misapplication of Your Honors’ opinions of two

23
years ago.
QUESTION2

But you say you weren't required, in order

to get relief, to file what you filed in the District Court.
MR. BAUM: That's correct.

Th© affidavit on the

subsequent proceedings.
QUESTIONS

Yes»

MR. BAUMs That's correct.

We were compelled to do

that. We think that went far beyond the requirements of any
of the cases.
In Williams Packing, as this Court knows, the tax*”
payer came in and said, ”1 don't owe the tax”, and this Court
said, "We're sorry, that does not got your an injunction?
pursue your remedies»"
And we don't have th© problem her® that troubled Mr.
Justice Blackmun in Americans United, of no problem of a tax
liability.

We haves a real tax liability which is before the

Tax Court? and the Tax Court is in a position to decide it,
as it does every day, and this Court, would then be in a position
to review it if it so desired at a later date.
But we are not in the position of sitting on th® man's
property for an indefinite period and keeping it.
QUESTIONS

But you're in a position of sitting on it

until th® Tax Court acts? and you aay you don't have to prove
anything until then.
MR. BAUM;

Until the taxpayer has come forward with

24
some showing that this assessment is 'made out of whole cloth.
That is, I submit, what the burden is in this case.
And I don't think the taxpayer, by any remote stretch
of the imagination# by a mere general denial that he owes an
tax# has mad© that showing.

MR0 BAUM:

Lastly, if I may, if the Court please, I

would like to point out that the Court of Appeals did rely on
two decisions? namely, Piszarello and Lucia.

Piasarello in the

Second Circuit? and Lucia in th© Fifth Circuit.
How, both of those, I think, illustrate the point that
possibly you, Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice Whit© were
making.

These are th© extremes.

In Pizz&rello, on the basis

of three days’ transactions, w© projected a wagering tax for a
five-year periodin this face of an indictment for two months.
In Lucia, we did it for over four years on the basis
©f on® day’s transaction.
I might add, in Piszarello there was the additional
factor that the evidence was illegally —- was obtained by an
illegal search and seizure.
Thank you. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lewin, maybe it will

save you on® interruption if I put a question to you right nov?.

26

I’v© been waiting to got your reaction to it.

Somewhat the

point that Justice Powell was pursuing.
On the last — I read the last paragraph of the Court
of Appeals opinion, at 17A of the cert petition, as indicating
that the irreparable injury which seems to b© the fulcrum was
that if h@ didn’t get this money, he wouldn't b© able to put
up bond when h© was extradited to Israel, and that it was ‘the
incarceration of Shapiro,

The opinion says;

K ... that after extradition Shapiro will b®
incarcerated, an incarceration that will cans® irreparable
injury for which he has no remedy at law.51
And so the Court of Appeals then decided it*
New, that was a premise that ha© seme flaws in it,
was it not?
ORAL ARGUMENT OP NATHAN LENIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LEW IN t Well, Mr, Chief Justice, 3: think that as
matters developed, subsequent to Mr. Shapiro's return to
Israel,it is true that that factor was dropped out of the case.
He is now on bail.
QUESTION;

Well, isn't that the fulcrum of this

opinion?
MR. LEWIN;

At the time the Court of Appeals reviewed

the case, that was the basis that we were relying on to establish
i rraparab le in j ury.

27
However, we think that if we were back in the District
Court today, w© could demonstrat© irreparable injury from -the
fact that I think Mr. Justice White pointed out? which is that
all this man's assets si the United States ar© presently being
held by the Internal Revenue .Service,

Which means that he is

not able to pay counsel to litigate the tax claim, that he
suffers the- earn© kind of irreparable injury that the Courts of
Appeals have held, for example, in the Willits case, which we
cite in our brief? in the Sherman case, the Third Circuit and
the Fifth Circuit have both held that jeopardy assessments which
essentially forfeit a man's entire assets deprive him of the
possibility of living during that period of time, do const!tut©
irreparable injury*
QUESTIONs What evidence is there in this record that
these constitute hi© entire assets, since he has now apparently
been able to make bail in Israel?
MR. LEWXNs Well, the representation we made to the
District Court, Mr= Chief Justice, was that he mad© bail because
a relative came forward at -the last moment and posted an
apartment as security, a relative who had no legal obligation
to Mr

Shapiro, but simply out of a family feeling, rattier than

seeing him in jail for an extended period,
I might point out, 'in that regard, Mr„ Baum has said
that h® has an urgent appointment for criminal prosecution in
Israel.

In fact, he's not even bean put to trial by this date

28

He’s out on bail this entire period of time»

in Israel»

And if* indeed* I might say in that regard,, if, indeed,
the United States thought that Mr. Shapiro, or had some evidence
that he was engaged in the kind of conduct that they alleged at
the last minute, at the eleventh hour in the civil proceeding,
w® submit they could very easily have asked the Israeli
authorities to defer any extradition so that they could institute
criminal narcotics proceedings against him»
That was not don©, and I think that the fact that it’s
not don® is a factor that this Court ought to consider in
determining the question of good or bad faith, or whether there
is at least, enough of a colorable “« enough ground for a
question in good faith to have a District Court look into this

issue»
Mow, Mr» ««
QUESTIONS

Tell me, Mr. Lawin, everything you said

indicates not that you’re going to argue an affirmance, but
that we ought t© vacate and send this back to the District
Court for & redetermination of the irreparable injury component
of your argument?
MR» LEWIN»

No, Your Honor,

I think we are arguing

an affirmance, because the Court — what I think th® government
overlooks —»
QUESTIONs Well» the way you’ve been arguing, I rather
thought you «-

Mo, to© Court of Appeals has remanded for
And that’s one of the things

for

Now, if subsequent developments in the course of
litigation are such that the further proceedings warrant either
an amendment to the complaint-, to allege a different form of
irreparable injury, we think we‘r© entitled to do that*
certainly think ws’rs entitled to a remand.

We

And that’6 what is

before to® Court at to© present time.
The government is asking for an affirmance, for,
essentially, a reversal of the Court of Appeals and an affirmance
of th© dismissal*
We say we’re entitled to further proceedings in th©
District Court, on various issues*

And th© thing *— I think

that what the government overlooks is that there arcs three
different issues in this easts available, or which should b©
available to us in th© District Court*
One is th® procedural issue, which I think I almost
understood Mr* Baum to concede is an. appropriate issue, if
raised by th© pleadings, and if properly presented to th©
District Court-.,
Now, we said in the. complaint, -and it’s very clear
in th® complaint, that there was no notice or demand before
to© seizure of these assets on December 6» That appears at
paragraph 18, which is page 11 of th® Appendix.

30
Now,- Mr, Baum says an affidavit subsequently submitted
to the District Court says that this notice was sent out? and,
in fact, he says, there's a copy of it that appears in our
brief at pages 12a to 13a,
We pointed out in that hearing in -the District Court
that that affidavit was the taxpayer's copy.

To which Mr. Baum

responds, as the trial counsel did in the District Court, well,
that just was simply produced from the computer records.
Well, the interesting tiling, which I don't think
comes out quit© clearly in the photostat in the brief, is that
the copy has a jagged edge, at least th© copy that we received.
Which certainly makes it look as if it was torn off some other
copies, and these forms, as l'v© seen them as a taxpayer, have
several copies you can tear off the top? the taxpayer tears
off the top, keeps it, sends back the second copy.
It looks to m®, if we were to have a hearing, that
we might vary well develop that the Internal Revenue Service
has in its records the physical copy that should have been
sent to Mr. Shapiro, .and never was.
Wow, if, in fact, that’s true, then there was no
proper jeopardy assessment under Section 6861, and th© intro­
ductory language to th© Anti-Injunction Act, which says 11 except
for section 6213{a) there may not be an injunction” would apply.
Because th® exception would apply.
tints that you may

QUESTION: Well, rather than pursuing a kind of B13

at dinner” theme, we really have to review what the Court of
Appeals did, don't we, that there may

be issues that it didn’t

reach, but, X think we wouldn't reach them, either.
MR. LEWIN: Well, X think, Your Honor, to the extent
that th® complaint alleges those •*>- raises those issues, and
they ar© not answered by the government's pleadings or, indeed,
we submit, by any subsequent submission — we're not disputing
th® procedural question of whether th© court may look to,
maybe, the subsequent hearing.
The government has lodged a hearing.

W@ certainly

don't want . empiric victory in tills Court. We’re not interested
in coming her® and taking the Court's time to get a rul© that
says:

Well, if the government files what it filed in that

subsequent hearing, th© case is over.
We thifik that's not true.

In fact, I think what the

facts develop, really, is that the basis for the government’s
claim that the taxpayer was on notice was a notice of
deficiency served on him at 12:20 p„m. on the date the complaint
was dismissed,

Th© judge said:

I will reconvene court at

3:00 p.ra. on Friday afternoon, December 21.
At 12:20 p.ra., we received, as counsel, copies of
this notice of deficiency which, for th® first time, said:
This man is, in the government's view, a dealer in narcotics.

32
The government, rather ©xtraordinarily says, in
light of that, with Mr, Shapiro being in New York, being of
the Orthodox Jewish faith, unable to coma to Washington to
appear at a hearing in response to that, his counsel cam© into
court, and said:

”Mr. Shapiro was called on the phone, and

denies this,'’
The government says in its briefs

The only thing

that th® respondent did, the only thing that the respondent did
was have on© of his counsel tell th© District Court that
respondent had advised another of his counsel that th®
Commissioner1s determination of the income from narcotics
dealing was false.
Well, that’s all he could do in the two hours and
forty minutes that h© had before the District Judge turned
around and said:

”The case is dismissed."

Thereafter, Mr, Shapiro filed a verified petition
in the Tax Court in which he denied being a narcotics dealer,
thereafter, at the hearing which Mr, Baum refers to, he filed
an extended petition in th© District Court which said, ”1 am
not a narcotics dealer,n
Indeed, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked what
would happen if the taxpayer cam® back with an affidavit or a
document that established where he had received th® funds.
That’s exactly what Mr, Shapiro did in th© hearing in th©
District Court., the record of which has been lodged with this

33

Court.
We filed &n affidavit from a resident of Switzerland,
who had

» who described in detail that she had held cash for

Mr. Shapiro while he was in Switzerland, and that she '. sent it
over to the United States.
All that is in the record in the District Court.

It’s

Court»

before the government can seize a man’s entire assets.

MR.LEWXNs Well, I think this Court’s ruling, whether it's
Fuentas and Chevin, or substantial other cases, have said that
there* has to be a meaningful hearing attached to that»
And only in. extraordinary circumstances may the hearing follow
the seizure.
Now, we are not challenging the fact that the Internal
Revenue Service lias authority, in appropriate circumstances, to
take the extraordinary step of jeopardy assessments.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, did you raise any constitutional

issue like this in the Court of Appeals?
MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. LEWINi

Yes f wo did.

W® said «•“

You did.
Our basic argument in the Court of Appeals,

Mr. Justice Rehnguist, and one that we argued there and I think
w® argued in the District Court, was that «« was a variety ©f

35
constitutional arguments,

On© was I guess what Mr, Justice

Blackmun referred to, the government on the on® hand excluding
a man from the country and, on the other hand, seising all of
his assets.
But if what you mean by these constitutional arguments
is the fact, that there should be some minimal showing on the
part of the government, I think we did raise that in the Court
of Appeals,

There’s enough her® for a remand to the District Court.
But we did argue t© the Court of Appeals, and we think

— we continue to think that it’s right, that if the government
put. the man in a position where he cannot litigate the tax
claim, particularly when that claim is based, as it is her®, on
an allegation that he committed criminal conduct, which is
really very hard to fight in absentia, they may not, at the
same time, seek to forfeit, all of his assets on -that tax claim,
QUESTION*

Wall, even if he won all this money at

the races, instead of by criminal conduct, it would still b®
subject to tax, wouldn’t it?
MR. LEWINs

It would.

But we think that the

difficulty with the government’s theory, and the government’s
approach in this case, is 'that if the government is able to use
an allegation of criminal violation as a basis for a jeopardy
assessment and then cut off all litigation of the basis for
that kind of a claim by citing -the Anti-Injunction Act, it opens
up the door for the Internal Revenue Service to become the
prosecutor ©f a-1 kinds of criminal offenses, because, clearly,

the other portions of which were brought to me after I arrived
in the United States»

I cam establish this fact by documenta­

tion and by 'the testimony of witnesses ? and would bs prepared
to do so in a bona fide inquiry into ray tax obligations.”
Nowt that «»"• of course that didn’t refer to narcotics
allegations, because there were no narcotics allegations made
at that point-,

Mr» Shapiro was not alleged to be a narcotics

dealer at that point.

It was only at the eleventh hour* before

the District Court was about to rule, that the — that that
allegation was made»

And it was in response to that kind of

allegation that the subsequent affidavit was filed in the
later hearing.
Now, I think I pointed out that as to procedure —
I think that’s on® issue that®a ©pan in the District Court? the
second issue which we believe is open in th© District Court, is
simply the question of good faith, and I don't — and 1 think
that this Court’s decisions in Enochs and in Bob Jones mate, it
clear that that is a legitimate issue that can be raised, even
under the Anti~Injunction Act.
In Enochs, ‘this Court said -«* pag© 370 U.S. — page
1 of 370 U.Sut

"To require more than good faith on the part

of the government would unduly interfere with” the objective
of protecting the collector from suit.
So, implicit in that was that good faith was an
element of what the .Collector of Internal Revenue had to

39
establish.

Th® same thing was true of the language in Bob Jones,

I think it*s page 740, the Court said:

“'User® is no evidence

that that position” — the position of the Internal Revenue
Service — "does not represent a good»faith effort to enforce
the technical requirements of the tax laws.”
Again i? there has to fe® good faith on th© part of the
Commissioner.
Now, we are not in a position where we’re simply a
taxpayer who has gone through a tax audit, the usual procedure
with th® Internal Revenue Service, and then comes in at th®
last minute says, ’’Well, you’re proceeding in bad faith.”
There are substantial indicia,

3imply

from the

allegations in the complaint, that this jeopardy assessment was
not a good-faith coil-action of revenue measure.

MR. LENINs Because I think the government knew that

If -th© government proceeds against, someone before he's about

MR. LEWIN:

Yes, we have a constitutional argument,

as well.
QUESTIONs Wall, you ought to make the argument, before
it's too late.
MR. LEW IN 5 Well, if — if what Your Honor is referring
to is that if the Internal Revenue Service acted on the basis
of what might be arbitrary and excessive procedures, then weTr©
entitled to proceed in the District Court under the procedures
that Lucia and Pizaarello set out? then I'd like to proceed,
directly to that point.
Those are two cases which the Court of Appeals
applied, one of which, X might say, was decided by a unanimous
en banc Fifth Circuit, that's fourteen judges of the Fifth
Circuit.

There was a separate concurring arid dissenting

opinion which, in fact, would have gone further than the
majority opinion in Lucia.
And what the Court of Appeals said in Lucia was that
if the government’s jeopardy assessment is alleged to he
arbitrary and excessive# then the government must at least
com© forward with something other than mar® protestations of

44
good faith.

AM the Court of Appeals indicated in Lucia that

it was not sufficient, if the government simply said, "Wallf
we made a projection out of -this mart’s wagering proceeds that
h® could have mad© so-and-so much money over the course of the
year.83
We think our case -- and the same thing is true in
Pizzarello.

Both of which involve admitted gamblers, who were

— whose assets, or who ware the subject of a seizure? as fco
which th© proceeds of their gambling for a definite period of
time was knowns

for on© day or for three days. And the

government made a projection from that.
In this case? we think it follows, a fortiori, from
Lucia and Pjgzarailo.

Because in this case Mr. Shapiro denied,

under oath, that he had ever been engaged in illegal activity.
On© doesn’t even reach th® question of projection.
In fact, if on® looks at. what the government relied
on in the later hearing bafor® th® District Court, they did
rely on a projection precisely like that that was involved in
Lucia and Fiassarello, and which the Courts of Appeals in those
cases held would be inadequate.
In this case, the government is asking th® projection
to be applied to th© kind of conduct?which I would think this
Court could almost take judicial notice, would not b© as
regular and repeated aa it would bs in the case? of on© who is
running a bookmaking establishment, who has regular daily

45

customers*
At most# what the affidavit which appears in our
brief# and which was filed by the government in that hearing#
shows was that on several isolated occasions they believe that
money that Mr* Shapiro received ware proceeds of hashish sal©.
So we have here th© denial of the illegal activity#
and# in addition to that# the projection.

We submit that both

those things# together# certainly warranted th® Court of
Appeals in saying that we were entitled to a day in court in
which iduat th© government used as a basis for its claim would
come forward in court# what we felt. —* what our client said in
response to that would com© forward in the court# and 'she court
would th©n male® a finding.
It*a true the Court of Appeals left vague what the
contours of that finding would be„

And the judge is given -«

th© trial judge is given substantial discretion to proceed
under such standards as he might think appropriate to this
particular case.
But we don’t think that that in any way undermines
th© bottom line of the Court of Appeals decision# which is#
really# that a complaint of this kind which alleges procedural
deficiencies, alleges bad faith on the part of th© government#
raising constitutional questions and alleges» that th© basis
for th® jeopardy assessment was arbitrary# excessive# and
beyond the constitutional power? therefore# the Internal Revenue

46
Servies warrants a full hearing in the District Court.

the Court of Appeals remanding to the District Court# and should
w@ assume that that's all we have and all we know and wholly
disregard wh&t has subsequently taken placa in the District
Court?

Or should we — or do w© have something more?
MR. LEWINs Well# certainly on behalf of the respondent#

1 would consent# if the government consents# to the Court

considering what happened in the District Court subsequent to
that time.
Simply because# from our client's point of view# w©
think it’s important to gat the matter resolved.
Now# we think the entire record that's before the
District Court should be before this Court.
cript is here.

I know the trans­

I must admit I’m not sure whether those two

affidavits have been filed# but X will chock that with the Clerk
and file them.
But if the government has filed# lodged these other
documents# and we both discussed them in Idle briefs# we certainly
would urge the Court to consider what happened subsequent to
that time.
QUESTION:

Well# the question —* you would b© agree-

47
afo I© to approaching the case by asking if the government had
filed immediately in answer to the complaint what it has now
filed in the District Court, whether or not, then, it would be
justified in holding your client’s property pending complete
hearing in the Tax Court?
MR. LEWlHs

Yea.

And, Mr. Justice White, if we had

filed in response to that what we filed in the District Court
in response to feat,
QUESTIONS

Yes, but all to the end, I gather, w©

ought look at all this, I gather is your summation, only to
se© whether the remand by the Court of Appeals to the District
Court should bs sustained or reversed?
MR. LEWINs Right. And I should point out, in that
regard, that what fee District Court said on the basis of feesm
facts is that there should be discovery.

So that our view

is feat there should b® further proceedings.
w® are •**«•
QUESTIONj

I think your answer to Mr. Justice White

and to me are inconsistent.
QUESTION r.

Yes,

MR. LENIN: Well, I’m sorry in feat regard.

I would

*"* in other words, the District Court has said -» the District
Court has now said there will be further proceedings, and has
ordered us to proceed wife discovery.
QUESTION: But I would take it from your answer to m®

48
that if w© look

at. th® record and if w® were willing to under­

take it, and we would say , Well, the government has filed all
it would ever need to file to satisfy any kind of an Enochs
burden, therefor®, if we decided that, we would say the
District Court was right in dismissing the case.
QUESTION*

Yes,

QUESTION*

That would be your — that's what your

answer means to me „
QUESTION* That's right,
MR, LENIN;
elusion. But w@ think

if the Court were to come t© ’that con*»
»

QUESTION* Well, I know, we may not come to that
conclusion, but, as a matter of fact, if you say we ought to *—
arguably, if you **» we should never undertake -that arguably,
w® should say w© remand to th© Court of Appeals to make this
judgment on the basis of what’s happened in th© District Court,
MR, LENINs

Except that there's bean no subsequent

appealable order, I suppose.
QUESTION*

That's right.

MR. LENIN; The Court of Appeals might consider it,
but th® Court of Appeals would b® considering it without an
appealable order,
QUESTION* Well, it would be as much ther© as it is
here.
MR, LENIN* Well, I suppos® that's true.

49

[Laughter. J
QUESTION:

It*s not either place, really.

MR, LEWINs But our feeling is that on the basis of
the record as it appears, there is reason for further proceedings
in ‘the District Court, and that’s why the Court of Appeals
judgment remanding it was correct- that there should be
further proceedings in the District Court,
QUESTION;

And then everything that's happened since,

you a ay , only supports that conclusion of the Court of Appeals,
is that it?
MR. LEW IN t

That’s right.

That's our position.

It supports the correctness of that conclusion.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank yota, gentlemen.
The can© is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3;05 o’clock, p„m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
