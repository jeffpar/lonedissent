MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Wo, 75-339# Buffalo Forge Company against United
Steelworkers of America.
Mr. Cohen# you may'proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY V. COHEW
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR, JEREMY COHEN:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it

The issues in this cas©# while significant#

will not# I am afraid, fo@ as stimulating to the Court as tbs
issues in the case argued just prior to this or in the case
argued yesterday, but I will do my best.
Til® company is a manufacturer in Buffalo, N®w York,
and in 1974 the Steelworkers Union was certified by feh®
National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive bargaining
agent for the company’s office employees.

At th© same time,

the union was also th® exclusive bargaining agent for th®
company's factory workers and had been for many# many years.
The factory workers had been covered by collective bargaining
contracts between th® Steelworkers and the company going back
into the late 1940's and early 1950*8.

Those contracts#

among other terms and conditions# contained broad no-strike
clauses, two in fact# a very broad definition of what matters
could ,b® resolved through th® grievance and arbitration
procedure# and at the time of th® instant dispute contained

4
provisions allowing both union and employer to us® the
grievance procedure to resolve items of policy or general
contract interpretation issues,
In the latter part of 1974, th© Steelworkers in th©
midst of bargaining the first contract for th® office and
technical workers, set up picket lines ©round th® company's
preraises in fch© Buffalo, Kew York, area, and conducted a
strike against th® Buffalo Forge Company.
Th© office workers and th® factory workers worked in
same buildings with

the offices generally being in feh© front

and th© factory area being in th® back, but used common
entrances.

Th® pickets were set up at thes© entrances and at

all other places surrounding th® company's premises.
Four days later, four days affear th© picketing was
established, th® respondent Steelworkers directed th® local
union officers of th® factory

local unions to honor th®

office worker picket lines which th® Steelworkers had
established and to instruct th© employees who w@r© members of
th© factory workers' local unions and members of th® Steel~
workers to also respect those office worker picket lines.
That afternoon th© company, having heard of a work
stoppage plan, fired off a telegram to th© Steelworkers
protesting that -th© rumored work stoppage would -be a violation
of the no-strike clause contained in th© factory worker
contract and offered to immediately arbitrate, go to arbitration

5
over any issue which held caused this potential work stoppage»
That telegram was ignored and the work stoppage
commenced the very next morning.
The company attempted to obtain injunctive relief
under the theory of Boys Markets from the Federal district
court.

Its application for a temporary restraining order and

preliminary injunction were denied, essentially on the theory
of the Fifth Circuit decision in the Amstar case, interpreting
this Cotirfc's decision in Boys Markets as having no application
to any breach of contract strike save the on© situation where
the strike is triggered by an ongoing or live grievance between
the union

and employer party to the contract.
Appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals

resulted in affirmance of the district court's decision on
essentially the same grounds that I just summarized.

A strike,

even if it were a broach of contract, had to b© literally over
or triggered by some ongoing live grievance between the
contracting parties.
It is our position generally, stated at th© outset,
that the requested relief falls squarely in th® pathway ©f
this Court's decisions in Boys Markets and Gateway Goal, as
well as those decisions, while they involved damage actions,
also indicate the Court's intention and purpose ©f finding
ways to meaningfully ©afore® both the no-strik© clausa as well
as the arbitration clause in the contract.

6
This is not, as a matter of premise, this is not th©
first time this Court has considered th® sympathy strike
situation.

The cas® is billed as on® which is th® first

sympathy strike case to appear before this Court, but it is
not.

On® week after this Court’s decision in Sinclair the

majority reversed th® Court of Appeals in Yellow Transit System
v. Teamsters, a case, very simply, which involved a union
and an employer who had an ongoing collective bargaining
relationship.

Th© union advised the employers in that cas®

that it was going to set. about organizing th® company’s office
work force.
QUESTION:
System

Th® style of that cas® is Yellow Transit

~
MR. JEREMY COHEN:
QUESTION:

Yellow Transit System —

Is it in th® —

MR, JEREMY COHEN:

It’s in th© reply brief, and it is

also mentioned in the respondents’ brief. Yellow Transit
System is mentioned on page 2 ~ or page 3, excuse m© — of
th® reply brief and on several pages of the respondents’ brief,
in particular page 9 of respondents* brief.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

Justice Marshall points out

it's Steamster3 v. Yellow Transit System.

That’s th© reason I

couldn’t find it..
MR. JEREMY COHEN:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry.

Thank you.

Yes.

7
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

The significance of that old case,

sine© the Court will recall that the reversal was a cm®-ward
majority opinion citing the Court8s decision in Sinclair, was
in our view the concurring opinion, the special concurring
opinion written by Judge Brennan, Justice Brennan, and in which
the other dissenters in Sinclair joined, in which the
concurring Justices said that the only reason they were
concurring in the result was because there was no agreement
between the parties to arbitrate any dispute.

There was no

clause in the contract providing for any terminal arbitration
over any dispute between the parties.
So this is not the first sympathy strike case that,
has come before this Court.

As you might suspect, your

Honors, we have — I have put it in a formula ~ that is, if
Teamsters v. Yellow Trains it is to Sinclair as Monongahela, the
Fourth Circuit case, is to Boys Market^ than the extension -I'd say extension, it's just a redundancy.

That is, our

position in Buffalo Forg© claiming that we w@r© entitled to an
injunction has the same relationship to Boys Markets as
Monongalia la has to Boys Markets and as we think the concurring
opinion in Teamsters v.Yellow Transit has to the original
Sinclair decision.
The respondents claim that only the narrow holding of
this Court's decision in Soys Markets applies, and that is
continuation of the requirement that the strike must be

the

8
literally over a live grievance.
It's position, in our view, is essentially that
Norris-LaGuardia is more than aliv© and well, it*s the dominant
them© of Federal regulation of labor-management relationships.
W© could not disagree more, and we think th© decisions of
this Court establish that Norris-LaGuardia does not invariably
bar injunctive relief,

for example, the unlawful strike.

Legislative history referred to in our petition for certiox'ari
and in our main brief indicate that it was not the intention
of th® Congress to bar injunctions against unlawful strikes.
Is this strike in fch© Buffalo Forge case unlawful?
It's our contention that by resorting to strike, given the
contract terms, that by resorting to strike without first
arbitrating th® disputed right of the union to engage in
conduct prohibited by th® contract, that it violated its
duty to arbitrate which it held freely given in the contract,
violated its duty to arbitrate without arrogating to itself
interpretation of th® collective bargaining agreement,
especially in tills cas® because the dispute arose the day
before th© work stoppage when the union directed its local
unions to respect the picket lines and th© company disputed
th® union5s right to issu© such an instruction.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Cohen, only to understand what you

just said about the issue that would have been presented to
th® arbitrator had thare been arbitration.

It would not have

9
been, as I understand it, whether the contract prohibited tbs
strike, but whether asstiming the contract prohibited the
strike, th® strike could go forward.
MR. JEREMY COHEN:
QUESTION:

It would have bean —

What would the issue have been?

MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Th© issue would have been, Mr.

Justice Stevens, that th® union’s directive — th© Steelworkers'
directives to their local union officials and members to honor
the office workers9 picket line was a violation of the no-strike
clause of that contract and that the arbitrator was empowered
to determine the union’s disagreements with the company's
position, that is, whether th© orders and the ensuing work
stoppage were in fact a violation of th© no-strike pledges
in the collecting bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

Did the Court of Appeals say that th®

arbitration clause did not reach this kind of a dispute?
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

The Court of Appeals and the

district court neither concluded that -th© arbitration clause
went to th© issue of arbitrability, the issue that I just,
described to Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Wall, did they ~

MR. JEREMY COHEN;
QUESTION:

There was in the Court of Appeals

Did they say that this kind of a dispute

was not arbitrable?
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Mo, they said that this was not

10
the kind of arbitral dispute which would permit the granting
of an injunction sine® it would not be an agent of. the
arbitration process,

Th© theory ©spoused by the Court of

Appeals was that only if th® strike is triggered by a live
grievance can it be said that injunction is appropriate because
the union is trying to evade or avoid its obligation to
arbitrate.
QUESTIONs

I thought if it isn't a live grievance»

though it isn't arbitrabale is it?
MS, JEREMY COHENz

Oh* very much so.

In fact this?

Court has often -QUESTIONS

Where does 'th® arbitration claus© appear

in the record here.
QUESTIONS

It*8 13A, 1 gather* isn’t it?

MR. JEREMY COHENs

In the appendix on page IS

there is & no-strik© clause and on page 17, paragraph 26 of
the agreement, there is the definition of arbitrable grievance»
And it is any dispute or any trouble of any kind arising in the
plant,
Thor© was in the district court’s decision — yea,
Mr. Justice.
QUESTIONS

Is there or is there not a determination

either by the district court or the Court of Appeals that
article 26 doss not reach* does not make arbitrable, this
dispute?

11
MR. JEREMY COHEWs
QUESTION:

No, there is no such holding.

Th®r@ is no such, holding.

MR. JEREMY COHEW:

No.

Thare is a statement in the

district court —
QUESTION:

If there was such a holding# would you fo®

her©?
MR. JEREMY COHEN:
QUESTION:

Wo.

But then I gather that is an interpretation

of a clausa which we are not likely to review, I gather.
MR. JEREMY COHEW:

Wo, if the Court were to decide

that the arbitration, clause did not cover this dispute, then
no way could ar- injunction be an aid of the arbitration
process.
QUESTION:

And your position is that the Court did

not decide that it did not reach this.

Did it decide that it

did reach this dispute?
MR. JEREMY COHEWs

It did not decide that either.

It decided, looking at th® district court's decision —
QUESTION:

W© have to decided that as an initial
fc-

question in hare?
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Wo, you don't.

In fact, I think

in reading respondents' brief, that there is essentially an
acknowledgement that the issue of the scop© of
clause is arbitrable.

a

no-strike

Footnote 6, among other things, in

the respondents' brief gees on at great length about the issues

12
of fact in law that arise under contracts such as the instant
one.

This is the Footnote 6 of the respondents5 brief, i

guess it's buff colored.

And many of the decisions of this

Court which vm have cited in our brief applying the principles
of the trilogy are to the effect that a disputed application
or disputed exception to a no-strike clause is presumptively
arbitrable.
QUESTIONS

What if the no-strik© clause here had

been absolutely plain on its face so that it was clear the
union was breaching it by engaging in this sympathy strike?
Would your cas© be stronger or weaker for the issuance of an
injunction?
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

I would say it would be stronger,

your Honor.
QUESTION %

Then yon are saying in effect that any

strike that is a breach of contract, in effect, whether it's
a breach of the union’s no-strika clause, can be enjoined,
aren't you? /
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

No, I am not saying that.

It’s

very important -that the Court understand th© company's position
in this ease.

A contract which contains the most — if w© had

in th® Buffalo Forge contract no arbitration provisionswhatsoever
only a clause which in addition to the iangu&g® already
expressed said, "And furthermore, there shall be no sympathy
strike whatsoever,” if the injunction in this case is not an

13
assistance to the arbitration process by which the parties
voluntarily agree that any dispute that they had* as defined
in th© agreement, would be resolved by arbitration without
resort to 301 litigation, then there is no injunction.

So w®

are not here asking this Court to adopt what I would regard as
a very substantial expansion of Boys Markets, that a mere
request of tbs employer given a clear no-strike pledge, all th©
Court has to do is make a determination whether th® contract
has been violated and, if so, enforce tha no-strike clause.
That has never, as far as I know, been th© policy of this
Court.

It is not the policy w© are asking th® Court to reach

on -fell® facts of this case.
So, simple enforcement of th© no-strik® clause is not
what’s at issue, at least it’s not th© main issue that th©
petitioner is raising in this case.
^

QUESTION3

So in answer t© Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s

question, if th® breach of th© collective bargaining agreement
were- very, very el-.jar, then it could hot be enjoined-.
QUESTION*?

Absent an arbitration clause.

MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Absent an arbitration clause.

Mr. Justice Stewart is saying that there really is no issue
of fact for an arbitrator •— no decision for an arbitrator to
render.

It is our contention, of course, that th© Court should

b© making no determinations of fact aside from determining
whether th© arbitration process is broad enough in scop© to

14
cover the dispute between the employer and the union.

One©

it makes a determination that the clause certainly is broad
enough, applying the presumptions of the trilogy, its
is finished.

business

What the respondent is in effect saying to us

is that we have, the union, “W© have a right to strlk® for a
while.

W© have a right to strike while the arbitration process

that we have committed ourselves to is being administered.55
QUESTION;

But, Mr. Cohen, could the union defeat

the injunction, then, by saying, BW@ concede your interpretation
of the contract and therefore there is no arbitrable issue.
We agree that it prohibits what w© are doing, but we are going
to do it anyway."
QUESTIONS

Then what would you hav© an injunction for?
W@ concede vm would lose in an arbitration,

■then what happens?
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Then you would get an injunction

because the union stipulation in court is still not ~ what
you would be doing, of cours©, is enforcing a no-atrike clause
without any enforcement of the arbitration process.
QUESTION:

Isn’t arbitration also for remedy?

It's

not just to settle factual disputes.
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Most certainly it should be for

remedy.
QUESTION:

You can't concede yourself out of

arbitration, can you, if the other party to the promise insists
on it?

15
MR. JEREMY COHEM:

No.

In fact, Mr. Justice White,

your decision in Draka Bakeries fits Buffalo Porge to a T.

W®

have in Drake Bakeries a requirement that arbitration rather
than Federal courts should have made a determination of
liability as wall as damages»
decision, you commented,

And in the Drake Bakeries

speaking for the majority, that there

was another case that cam© out of the Second Circuit in which
there was as broad an arbitration clause as the one you wer©
?

dealing with in Drake.

And that was M&rkle Electric.

In

writing so many briefs in this case, I hav® had to dig deeper
and deeper for my own enjoyment in presenting this argument,
and I had to smila when I noticed th© quotation of the Markla
Electric case because it was my late partner Edward Flaherty
who negotiated both th® original MarkIs Electric contract and
the original Buffalo Forgo contract which had identical
descriptions of arbitral grievance that you will find in
paragraph 26 of th® current contract.

So that arbitration

Rust be used both for determination of liability and for
determination of any penalties, if there ar® any to be paid.
QUESTION:
as you envision it?

How would th® arbitration proceed here
Th© union is presumably enjoined from

striking, and then you go to arbitration as to whether or not
b

they have a right to engage in th® strike.
remedy could th® arbitrate?

What sort of

prescribe in that situation

where you are talking about a. kind of conduct that has never

16
taken place?
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

Injunction as well as damages.

The Fifth Circuit, for example, in the decision involving U.S.
Steel and tha Min© Workers mad© it quite clear that if an
arbitrator issued a back-to-work order as part of the
arbitration process, that that court would enforce the
arbitrator's award by having it confirmed at the employer's
request.
QUESTION;

But if the union has never gone on strike

why would there ba any back-to-work order?

The union is

enjoined from striking.
MR. JEREMY COHEN:
strike took placa?
proposition.

If the injunction occurred before

I must have misunderstood the fact

The problem here is that in many, many cases, Mr.

Justice Rehnqui3t, the employer or the union is about to do
something, for example, closing down a plant because of
adverse economic conditions or the employer is going to chaag©
tha hours of work.

It is usually not a surprise to the union.

There are opportunities to utilise grievance procedure, there
are opportunities to attempt to resolve the matter in advance,
its indicated by the facts in this case, the union is not likely
to'give th® employer advance notice of its intentions to engage
in a sympathy strike.

In this case, in fact, we had only but

a few hours* notice of a rumored strike plan.

About all th®

employer was able to do was to fir® off its telegram saying if

1?
there ia some problem, we are willing to arbitrate it and
besides you are violating the collecting bargaining agreement»
We had to, under the circumstances, appeal to the
Federal district court for expeditious relief.
QUESTION?

Mr. Cohen, I am still troubled by trying

to understand precisely what issue would b® arbitrated if the
union conceded that the no-strike clans© was applicable, and
'then Mr. Justice Whit© suggested maybe you would arbitrate the
issue of remedy.

But if you entered a Boys Market injunction

pending the arbitration and everybody's at work, what issue
could there be with respect to remedy?

There is no issue as

to liability because they have conceded the clause applied.
What issue as to remedy would bo presented?
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

The union is not on strike at this

time.
QUESTION:

It has been enjoined.

You have gotten

the relief you asked for in this case.
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

But the strike started but was

stopped by the injunction?
QUESTION;

Well, say, you got 24 hours notice and

you ran to court and got your injunction before anybody left
work.
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

There would only then be the

academic question whether the union’s threatened conduct was a
violation' -

But fch©y have conceded that under my

Then what should a court, do, vacate th©

terrible difficulty understanding precisely what is supposed
to happen here.
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

If w® appeared before — let's

say we had a threatened strike, sympathy strike, and if in
responsa

to that the employer appeared before a Federal

district court judge with th© appropriate papers and the union
appeared and said there is no -issues for arbitration, we agree
the employer is right, if we did strike,there would be a
violation of th® contract, and th® looked at me and said,
"Hr. Cohen, what do you want us to do?*5

If the union were,

despite' that exchange in front of th® Federal district court
judge, going to rosum® picketing a day or two later, then I
imagine I would get rather expeditious relief from the Federal
district court judge in view of that assurance that th© union
was expressing to th® district court judge that there was no
reason for —
QUESTION:

Th© theory of th® relief would be enjoining

19
a breach of contracto
of arbitration.

You are not getting an injunction in aid

Would that not b© correct?

MR. JEREMY COHEN:
QUESTION:

That would to© correct.

So your position is that you ar© entitled

to an irAjunction against the strike in breach of contract.
MR. JEREMY COHEN:

No.

If the union agreed that a

strike would violate the contract, yet it insisted on its right
to strike anyway, than I would say the court would be within
its rights under the guidelines of Boys Market

to issue th®

injunction because th© union does not mean what it says if
it®s insisting that a strike would breach the contract, it has
a right to breach th© agreement, there is still a dispute
between the employer and th© union as to whether th© no-strike
elans© applies to th® union's threatened or actual conduct, and
that should b© resolved by an arbitrate?: and the strike situation
you mentioned should b® maintained while th© parties
expeditiously decide whether its right would be a breach of
the contract tad what remedy, if any, th© arbitrator will allow.
If I tell you that there is no violation of a nostrike clause, y@t I insist on my right to strike anyway,
then there is obviously a continuing dispute between th© parties
©bout whether you can strike despite th© existence of a ban
against striking contained in th® —
QUESTION:

I talc© it in this case, however, that

you've got her© that th© union says that conduct did not violate

20
fch© no-strike clause.
MR. JEREMY COHEN;
QUESTION ;

And still disputas it h@r@.

MR. JEREMY COHEN;
QUESTION;

Th© union has disputed that.

Apparently so.

What does this mean, 18a,

the very

first sentence in th© district court’s opinion, "The Boys
Market standards do not apply to this case bacausa there is no
arbitrable grievance between the parties."
Now, is that or is it not an interpretation of
section 26 as to th® reach of the obligation to arbitrate?
MR. JEREMY COHEN;
paragraph 26.

It is not an interpretation of

It is a literal interpretation of this Court’s

decision in Boys Market that -there was no arbitrable grievance —
QUESTION;

That’s preceding that, though, Mr. Cohen,

because properly stated, I thought,

.at 17a, th® third thing

the court must find that both parties are contractually bound
to arbitrate th© underlying grievance that caused the strike,
which is what Boys Market said.

And I don’t know why that

first sentence is not to h@ read as an interpretation of

26

that this dispute is not made arbitrable by paragraph 26, isn’t
it?
MR. JEREMY COHEN;

I think a fair reading of th®

complete opinion as well as the Court of Appeals * decision shows
us that the district court and the Court of Appeals did not

21
find that there was no arbitrable dispute, but that there was
no arbitrable dispute which wou3,d support an injunction.
QUESTION:

Isn't the key word "grievance"?

doesn't say there is no arbitrable dispute.

H®

They said there

is no grievance under the collective bargaining agreement
subject to arbitration.

That distinguishes it from Boys Market.

Is that the meaning of that first sentence?
MR. JEREMY COHEN:
•that sentence.

I believe that’s the meaning of

I know that the respondent has argued that

that is a finding of fact. But if that is a finding of fact,
it flies in the fac© of every decision, whether it's a damage
action or an injunction action issued by this Court, and it
is not a proper interpretation of what the district court or
the Court of Appeals have decided.
1 would like at this time to reserve whatever few
moments I hav® left.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. COHEN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GEORGE COHEN:
please the Courts

Mr. Chief Justic®, and may it

It is the respondent union's position that

no Boys Market injunction is proper here for two separate
and distinct reasons:
Number one, this was not a strikes over an arbitrable

22
grievance.
And, number two, —
QUESTION:

You mean it’s outside th® reach of

paragraph 26?
MR. GEORGE COHEN:

Mr. Justice Brennan, what we mean

by that is the dispute between the United Steelworkers of
America and th® Buffalo Forg© Company which led to th®
sympathy strike had nothing to do with any term or condition
of employment which was subject to th® grievance arbitration
machinery of section. 26.
QUESTION:

Is that answering me?

There is no dispute

here that is within th® reach of th® arbitration?
MR. GEORGE COHEN:

Well, I will say yes to that, but

I don’t want to mislead th© Court.

Down the line th© question

of whether or not the strike itself, albeit not over an
arbitrabis grievance, creates an independent arbitrable
grievance, th© answer to th® latter question is yes under the
no-strike provisions of the contract.

A grievance ultimately

is presented which is available to the arbitrator, but w@
want to emphasis© that the company while invoking th© pro­
arbitration policy of section 301 never even invoked th®
arbitration procedure.

They never even filed a grievance

alleging that the strike itself — and her© what we are
talking «about is th® legality of th® strike itself — was in
fact a breach of the no-strike clause.

23
We don't think that’s th© touch s ton®. The touchstone
we maintain is that on© has to go back and look at the
threshold questione

.Mr. Cohan, you may resum®.

OPAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. COHEN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS {CONTINUED)
MR. GEORGE COHENs

Mr. Chief Justice, the cas© here

before vis follows in our analysis strictly along the lines of
the Boys Market decision of this Court.

In Boys Market the

parties had entered into a collective bargaining agreement
which included a provision that the adjustment of all grievances,
all disputes concerning the meaning, application, or interpreta­
tion of a collecting bargaining agreement would foa resolved
through final arid binding arbitration.
In the face of that particular —
QUESTION:

MR. GEORGE COHEW:

Once again, Mr. Justice White,

it depends on the language of the contract.

In this contract,

for example, it's clear that the employer had a right to file
a grievance claiming that the union strike was a breach of the
no-strike clause.
QUESTION:

With whom would he file it?

MR. GEORGE COHEW:
QUESTION:

With whom?

He would file if with the union.

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

He would file it with the union,

that’s right.
QUESTION:

You would call that a grievance.

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

We call that a grievance.

And

then th© procedure which would then be triggered would follow
up to and including final and binding arbitration.

In any

©vent, in Boys Markets, th© employer contracted out certain
work which th© union maintained constituted a breach of the
collective bargaining agreement, because it was work which the
union claimed under the contract belonged to employees in th©
bargaining unit.

The union didn't file a grievance, the

union didn’t follow the grievance arbitration machineryb
instead, went out on strike in support of its position that
that work had to be reassigned to the employees in the bargaining
unit.
In th® face of that strike, tha employer sought an
injunction.

And this Court was confronted with the possible.

26

dilemma of on. the one hand a Ncrris-LaGuardia seemingly
absoluta ban on enjoining any strikes and on the other hand
the pro-arbitration policy as set forth in section 301 of the
Taft-Harley amendments .

And this Court concluded that it was

possible to accommodate those tv;o competing and conflicting
policies by writing a very narrow and limited intrusion upon
the Norris-LaGuardia ban.

And -that intrusion was predicated

on the assumption that it was necessary to have an injunction
where the vindication of the arbitration policy was at stake.
More particularly, for example, in Boys Market what this meant
was essentially that if the union had succeeded in bringing to
bear enough economic pressure on the employer so

that the

employer so that the employer would capitulate and give in
to the union’s demand by reassigning the work.

The consequence

of that action by the union would have been to undermine the
entire arbitration process, said this Court in Boys Market
because in essence it would have taken away the jurisdiction
of the arbitrator and transferred it into the industrial warfare
that the whole policy and procedure of section 301 was designed
to avoid.
So, said this Court, we will, in order to vindicate
section 301, set forth certain very specific requirements,
and those requirements, of course, the petitioner has referred
to as being literal requirements.

W®. submit they are both

literal and they also captures the very underlying purpose and

27
intent of Boys Market, namely, that although there is no
general Federal anti-strike policy and therefore NorrisLaGuardia should prevail, said tills Court in Boys Market, even
where there is a breach of a private contract unless it can be
shown that some additional compelling public consideration is
present„
Now, that additional compelling public consideration
was present, said this Court in Boys Market, because 'the strike
was designed to undermine, and indeed was undermining,
arbitration, and the Court determined it would vindicate
arbitration by doing two things ~~ one, compelling the parties
to in effect go back to arbitration, and, two, enjoining the
strike at that time.
QUESTION;

You think there is no undermining of the

arbitration clause here even in a symbolic sense?
MR. GEORGE COHEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, that is clearly

Our position, and 1C think if you focus on the

saying is basically as follows;

What we are

That as contrasted from Boys

Market where the strike was in fact designed to obtain
capitulation over an arbitrable grievance,over a term of
condition of employment about which the parties w©re disputing

and which fch® parties had agreed to submit to an arbitrator
for his final and binding decision.

That's Boys Market.

Now, as contrasted from the situation here# the
union was out on strike# there was no dispute between the
union and the employer as to any term or condition of
employment for any of the production and maintenance employees.
There was nothing the employer could do, unlike in Boys Market,
which would constitute a concession that would have resolved
that problem —
QUESTION?

But, Mr. Cohen, I take it th© parties

could have written — could have written — a provision for
arbitration which would hav© reached this very situation, could
they not?
MR. GEORGE COHEN:

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

As far as we are concerned# that

QUESTION:

Anyway you agree that that's so.

MR. GEORGE COHEN;

We clearly agree that# and we

agree that if the company had filed a grievance# they were
clearly entitled to arbitration on the question of whether or
not the no-s£r±ke clause had bean breached.
QUESTION:

And if you had filed — if this grievance

had been filed and the employer had said# "And by the way#
while this grievance is pending for decision# you must not
strike," you would say, "We are going to strike until and

Correct.

We would say that# and

our support would be the Norri.s-LaGuard.ia Act, Mr. Justice

MR. GEORGE COHEN;
further than that.

Well —

Normally not.

But it even goes

Let's look, for example, at Boys Market.

In Boys Markets, when this Court ordered the parties in effect,
by remanding to the district court, to send that dispute as to
Contracting-out to arbitration, and at the same time enjoining
the strike,

th® Court didn't go on to say, "And by the way,

Mr. Employer, reinstate th© status quo, turn that work back
and give it back to the employees.n
QUESTION;

If an employer discharges someone and thsre

.8 a grievance filed over it and it goes to arbitration, pending
arbitration the fellow stays fired, unless th© employer
voluntarily puts him back to work.
MR. GEORGE COHEN;

That's right.

And, of course, that's

not only arbitration law, that's really basically consistent
with the whole industrial relations reality, which is to say
the employer acts and the union reacts and management has
certain prerogatives, and that's how it functions.

QUESTION:

Mr- Cohen,, to pursue Justice White’s

question about th© scope of arbitration clauses, could you have
a valid arbitration clause that provided that, if any strike or

day on the offending party, would that he enforceable?

1 would like to couch it in tfass©

Th@ union was engaged in what is protected strike

activity under the National Labor Relations Act, unless and
until there is a clear and unequivocal waiver as contained in
the no-strike claus©„

And there is a very substantial question

insofar as th® merits ar© concerned here as to whether or not
this language, just this general statement that there will be
no strike, in fact would constitute a waiver of that basic
fundamental protected right.
QUESTION;

How did you answer Mr. Justice White

when he asked you if th© meaning of that clause was open to
arbitration?

I think h® asked you that question.

MR. GEORGE COHEN;

I said that,of course, it was

open to arbitration right her®, your Honor.

In other words,

let's suppose that this company not only invoked th© name of
arbitration, as they ar© doing before* this Court, but they
actually filed a grievance.

They had an absolute right to

file a grievance contending that strike was in breach of the
no-strike clause.

MR. GEORGE COHEM;

Well; if you are not striking ~

I think you have to keep coming back to the threshold question:
Ar© you striking over an arbitrable grievance?

nothing to vindicate in terms of the arbitration policy.

Your insistence was that in order to

reach an appropriate accommodation that would not intrude
improperly on Norris -LaGuardia, you had to make sure that the
strike itself was over an arbitrable grievance.

If it is not

arbitration, and you are left with on© thing and one thing only,

Suppose h® had,

then you say it would be arbitrable under the clause.

Neverthe­

of the agreement.

That makes the underpinning of the Steelwork©!

MR. GEORGE COHEN:
QUESTION:

I don’t 'think so.

Because you are going right on with

interrupted production — that's what the effect of the strike

36
is — while arbitration is going on and all you wind up with,
the strike they say is lawful or unlawful, and if the arbitrator
decides it's unlawful, as I understand you, ‘chare would be
nothing that the employer could do about it at that juncture.

ME. GEORGE COHEN:

Could he?

MR. GEORGE COHEN:
QUESTION:

Right.

The arbitration is completed and the

arbiter concludes it was a violation of the contract, he can’t
review that.

Can tha employer at that juncture get an

is production continues while arbitration goes on.

That's your position.

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

In this instance, as far as w© are

concerned, you have got two deficiencies, not only don’t you

It may be that the courts below said they

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

That*s the correct, legal analysis

that they would coma out the same way.

All I am suggesting is

the fact that they didn't* and the fact that there is a
substantial question as to whether or not there is a breach at
all is a separate* independent argument we have in support of
tin© proposition that no injunction should issue.

Because whAt

you are talking about here is a situation where we have a
protected sympathy strike unless and until there is a clear
and unequivocal waiver.

41
The circuits that have looked at that question, for
example, in the Seventh Circuit, we cited the Gary Hobart
case and the Hyster case, have looked for very clear and
unmistakable language, and in some instances had said the
general language of a no-strike clause does not suffice to
bring it within the waiver doctrine, ani they look to the
bargaining history of th® parties to ascertain whether or not
when they have reached an agreement that there would be no
strike, that th© union had in effect agreed that it was
foregoing protected NLHA rights —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Cohen, didn't-both cases turn on th©

scopa of the arbitration clause rather than the scope of th©

If th©

What I said was if you have

grievance- but that eventually you get an arbitration award and
the question is if the union in the face of that arbitration
award continues to strike, than I am saying the Court is
called upon to make an independent analysis, and it's different
than Boys Market to the extent that you never had a strike cv&x
an underlying grievance.

That's th® difference.

No, but if you prevail on that ground bare,

then we never reach the thing you and I have been talking about.
MR. GEORGE COHEN:

Well, I don’t know what the

company's position was insofar as the failure to file a
grievance.

It appeared to us that they were waiting for the

union to file a grievance requesting some advisory opinion from
an arbitrator as to th© legality of cur going out on strikes.
That appeared to nva what counsel was saying to th© Court this
morning in the face of the whole structure and system of
arbitration, which, of course, is not how it functions.
QUESTION:

Well, th© complaint filed in this cas©

asked the Court to order both parties to go properly to
arbitration.

Look at page 10, paragraph (b).

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

If you

will notice, however, that refers back to a problem that in fact
never got before the court.
If you look at paragraph 13 of th© complaint, at
pages 6, you will se© what happened.
Stewart, is essentially this:

What happened, Mr. «rustic-.:

Th© petitioner recognized that

he was coining in for an injunction in circumstances that
• couldn’t satisfy Boys Market.

They couldn't satisfy Boys Market:

because tha union strike wasn’t over an arbitrable grievance.
r

So th© employer tried to create an arbitrable grievance by
saying there war soma activity going on at th© plant which was
in fact arbitrable under the contract and that the union was

46
actually striking over that arbitrable dispute.

It involved

th® question of whether truck drivers should handle a certain
kind of work.

That is referred to in paragraphs — particulaxly

paragraph — I think I told you th© right paragraphs of the
complaint.
What happened in district court, though, was th®
court found that th© sol® underlying cause of this strike was
th® sympathy action of th© union and that there was no evident
to support th© company’s assertion that th© underlying cause
of the strike was in fact an arbitrable grie\ranc® which would
have triggered Boys Market.
Now, that finding of fact by th© district court was
never appealed to th© circuit and stands -—
QUESTION:

Is that the first sentence I pointed out

to Mr, Cohen in the district court opinion, page 18a or
something?

Was not a strike over an arbitrable grievance.
MR. GEORGE COHENs

No, I still don’t think that is

what was being referred to, Mr. Justice Brennan.

That was

referring to th© cor® question of do you have a strike over
an arbitrable grievance.

Absolutely.

And fch® Court here says there is no

arbitrable grievance between th® parties.
MR. GEORGE COHEN:

No, I am sorry.

That has to be

Arbitrable dispute, I would say.

MR. GEORGE COHEN:

They were focusing on what was th© strike over.

And the strike

was a sympathy strike which had nothing to do with any dispute»
between the parties as to th© terras or conditions of employment
of th® production and maintenance employees.

Why didn’t you make a grievance of this#

MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Your Honor# there is some nonsens®

that is being discussed with this point about whether th®
employ©r ever precipitated the filing of a grievance.

As I

mentioned in opening argument# as soon as th© employer learned
of som© kind of a strike plan# it immadiately fired off a
telegram to the union#which is in the joint appendix# complaining
about the report and offering to go to arbitration over any
dispute which it caused —

Is that in the appendix?

MR. JEREMY COHEN;

We thought we had in the telegram

as well as when w® came before fch© district judge and
immediately announced our position was twofold — on®, w© thought
the strike had b©@n caused because of this dispute involving
truckdriving assignments, and also using the line of cases
that I will identify as the Monongahela type of cas®, felt that
’’over a grievance" should not b® interpreted literally, that
so long as the strike involved an arbitrable matter, then •—

What do you usually do, when you sand

somebody a letter or communicate with them and say., nI hav© a

MR. JEREMY COHEN;

That’s true.

Yes, but there ar© cases where

well, I'm trying to answer this quickly

because it is obviously bothering -the Justices.
First, the employer need not hav© any right under the
contract to require the union to arbitrate.

That is, &ve

if

the employer has no right to compel the union to arbitrate the

50
issue of a no-strike breach, we should be entitled, the
employer should be entitled, to got an injunction simply because
the union has a right to have the matter arbitrated, and I am
referring to tee Monongahela line of cases where the employer
had no right to go to arbitration —
QUESTION:

That is has no right to initiate it.

MR. JEREMY COHEN:

Has no right to initiate it.

ted the question of who has tea right to initiat® it is
irrelevant, w® contend.

Itfs a question of whether under the

contract there is an arbitrable dispute.
How, if I cGuld make on® comment about an issue teat
is obviously troubling several of the Justices —
QUESTION:

Make it very brief.

MR. JEREMY COHEN;

I will.

If in Boys Market the union had said to the employer

and th© Court, not only do w© have no right to compel the
employer to have bargaining employees stock fch© shelves versus
vendors8 employees, w® agre® that if \m struck for that result.,
it would b©

a violation of th© contract.

Now, if teat issu© had b@@n presented to the Court if
Boya Market where th® union strike was simply to force th©
©aployer to exercise discretion on behalf of th© bargaining
unit, I suggest that.you would have still mad© the same decisiin Boys Market that you eventually did.
MR. CH*IEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall.
