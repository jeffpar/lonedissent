MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 75-5027, Russell Bryan against Itasca County,
Minnesota.
Mr. Becker, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD P. BECKER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. BECKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
Minnesota Supreme Court.

The court sustained the lower court*s

decision imposing granting a judgment for a tax on a mobile
home owned by an Indian which is placed, on Trust Land.
The case originated in 1972 in the county court, the
district court in the northern, part of the Leech Lake Reserva­
tion when the county assessed certain taxes which are referred
to in state law as a mobile home tax or personal property
taxes on this mobile home owned by Mr. Bryan, who is an
enrolled member of the tribe, lives with his family in this
house trailer at Squaw Late on the Reservation.
He has an assignment of tribal trust land from the

tribe which he uses as his heme plot on which the trailer rests.
It is hooked to water, sewer and electricity.
The district court held that public Law 280
Xl'Xtl z

icl Minnesota to place and impose a tax on this kind of

property e a mobile home used by an Indian as his home
'Che Minnesota Suprco-e Court sustained that reading of
the statute and concluded that the Congress

changed the

authority that had heretofore been denied to the states and
allowed the states to impose their tax laws, including the tax
law which permitted the counties to collect the tax on this
Indian's mobile home.
Now, the statuti- involved here is commonly known as
Public Law 280 and if the Court please, I will refer to it as
Public Law 280 throughout.

It has become the jargon of the

trade, so to speak — in the citations that are in the briefs
It was passed in 1953.
Prior to that time and as confirmed by this Court
as late as .1973, states, absent some express authorization
from Congress have to aathoy/ifce to impose their tax laws within
the boundaries of an Indian Reservation on an Indian member of
the tribe,

We are not discussing non-Indians.
Tr

19 73, dv.a — as •• .he legislative history indicates,

to a large measure the breakdown on some reservations of law

a a d o :l de r avi d, i • n

i-fect, a tribal court justice system, the

Congress passed Public Law 280 and Public Law 280 provided that
criminal offenses committed by or against Indians within the
1'rider

ccuritt’ in certain specified states among * hi r

Minnesota -- excepting

the Red Lake Reservation - — would be

prosecutable in state courts.

5

On. the civil side, as long as courts of the states
were effectuating some order, hopefully, and justice on the
criminal side, the legislation included a. provision for causes
of action involving Indians which had heretofore been outside
of the boundaries of state court jurisdiction to be subject to
adjudication in the state trial courts.
The language of the statute, we think, is of critical
importance.

The language of the statute is at 28 U.S.C. 1560

of the codification of the statute after the clause indicating
which states would mandatorily be subject to its terms as;
"The following states shall have jurisdiction over
civil causes of action between Indians or to which Indians are
party which arise in the areas of Indian countries listed.”
Aid then the statute goes on, '‘And those civil laws
of such state or territory that are of general application to
private persons or private property shall have the same force
and effect within such Indian country as they have elsewhere."
New• that is the A
C

part of the statute.

we believe has to ba read in conjunction with A.

Oi;,r position, v ry quickly, is that this is a causa
of action.

This is a lawyer53 statute.

Nobody uses "cause of

action" in general parlance.
If somebody is going to say "The laws are applicable
acre," you cue subject to that law.

Nobody says, "You shall

hive 3 cause of action"and what it shall be.

It is just not

6
the kind of 1 rnguage most people would use unless they happened
to be trained in

the law or mistrained or whatever but C

section, I think, nails down that cause of action reading of
section A and that is the last line.
It reaffirms the idea that the tribal governments
will content you to have authority to promulgate ordinances
and regulations and customs which will govern their members in
their daily lives as Indians on uhe Reservation.
QUESTION:

The last —

What about civil law in the state of

general applicability?

Under law, doesn’t 280 make that

applicable on Indian reservations?
MR. BECKER';

State law of general applicability in

connection with causes of action, yes, and the question is,
what kinds of law are those?
QUESTION:

Our position is —

I know you tie the civil

laws to causes

of action, but —
MR. BECKER.

I think that is the only way to read it,

otherwise -—
QUESTION:

I know you do, but it just says, "And

those civil laws of such state or territory that are of general
* h?.V: catica t :> private persons or private properties shall
have the same enforcement effect."

MR. BECKER:

Well, I think if you look at the C

section, year Honor, it says the Indian laws shall be given
mil force and effect in the determination of civil causes of

7
action pursuant to this section,
QUESTION;
MR. BECKER;
QUESTION x

Well, I understand that.
And 1' think that —
It also says it is not inconsistent with

any applicable civil law of the state.
MR. BECKER:

That is correct,, but the point I wanted

to make is the determination? that determination, again, is a
word of adjudication.

It is a word that lawyers use for

adjudging, you know, disputes between individuals.
The argument that civil laws of general application
here means all laws, you know, irrespective, negates the whole
idea of causes of action, you know, as being an adjudicatory
demand.
QUESTION;

Well, if I live in

Itasca County and

don’t pay my taxes, doesn’t either the county or the state have
a cause of action against me for failure to pay the taxes?
MR. BECKER;

That is correct,

What we would call ---

they could bring a civil action against you

to foreclose on

any property or, in some cases, depending on the tax court
judgment for those taxes.

That is correct.

And that is a.

cause o€ action.
But I think you misread this statute if you read it
as a

word.

You are

Justice Rahnqti.ist, as, I think, as the

8

termination acts have been read.

That is,, all laws, civil and

criminal, shall be applicable.
Our reading of this is — and we think consistent
with the

legislative history — is that this statute talked

about making a forum for adjudicating disputes between Indians
and nonlndic.ns available on the Reservation, where they had
hcjretcfox-e been unavailable.
Once that decision to afford a forum had been made,
the problem arises what kind of law is applied in that form?
What

are the rules of decision?
QUESTION;

Well, would you explain subsection B,

then, which purports to be an exemption from a much -more
general type of authority, I think, than you are talking about?
ME. BECKER:

We read subsection B very differently

and I think that is a mistake that the Minnesota Supreme. Court
has made.

The Minnesota Supreme Court argues, A, it means

everything goes and B says, this doesn’t go and we don't think
that that is the proper reading.
B, in our view, is there for one purpose,..

It is

there in the criminal section and the civil section.

It is

there for the purpose of assuring the Indians that there would
be no change in the federal trust relationship and the
federal trust responsibility and the fact that trust property
taxes are referred to is part of that attempt by Congress to
assure the Indians that this would work no change.

This --

9
QUESTION:

You said a moment ago that this was a

lawyer’s statute drafted by lawyers and presumably using legal
language rather than just language of general applicability.
Nowf certainly, a lawyer would read subsection 3 as
carving out a portion of authority that is otherwise delegated,,
wouldn’t he?
MR. BECKER:

Not necessarily.

1 think that is a

simple way to read it, but I think we are reading this against
a background of Indian legislation which, prior to this time,
there had been no authority at all.
QUESTION:

If you wanted to give the Indians some

assurance, you would say nothing in this section shall author­
ise any taxes on Indians or their property, period.
MR. BECKER:

Well, that certainly would be one way of

doing it.
QUESTION:

And don’t get complicated about it by-

talking about trust property.

You just give the broad

exemption, which is what you are arguing for anyway.
MR. BECKER:

Well, we argue that that is the proper

reading of the statute, your Honor.

But I think the words,

causes of action, combined with civil laws of general
applicability indicate to us that it is an adjudicatory statute
but at worst — or at best, if you will, it is an ambiguous
statute.
Certainly, it is not easy to figure out what it means

10
and I think the legislative Liistory nails down that taxes were
not intended to be authorized by the A portion of any other
part of this statute.
The legislative history is clear that this is a law
and order statute.

The legislative history is clear that those

states that were possibly coming under the terms of the
statute because it was going to be, at that time, a fifty-three
or consent feature — a number of them, Nevada, for example,
refused to come in.

They refused to come in because they

would not. have been able to recoup what they felt was their
cost through taxation and not just taxation on trust property.
There is discussions in the legislative history about
taxation on sales and where they take place cn and off the
reservation and discussion of income taxes and corporate taxes
and other kinds of taxes an

t is — if anything is clear from

the language and the legislative history and the discussions,
;1- is that nobody conceived this statute as changing in one
iota the- tax status of Indian Reservations and I might add that
nobody was

tax status was of Indian

Reservations until 1973 so in a sense, that is an additional
nail to the idea that Congress was not sitting there trying to
figure now, which taxes are what we are going to authorize?
Which are we not going to authorise?
The legislative history read in toto seems to us to
cuyf we are not doing anything with regard to taxes on this and

11
B is in there.

We want to assure you that the trust relation­

ship is not changing.
Remember, in a sense, this statute was not imposed
upon the Indians.

The Indians came looking for this statute.

The Government indicates the Indians agreed.

MR. BECKER:

Mr. Justice White. I think

you misunder­

The statute gave, in 1953, consent to every

state in the union tc assume jurisdiction unilaterally under
the statute.

That was not changed until 1968 and the passage

of the Indian Civil Rights Act with the amendments to Public
Law 280.

In 1953, any state that wanted could have picked up

jurisdiction under this statute.
Most states did not — almost -- maybe two states
did and they weren't out in the Middle West or the West and
they picked it up — those states, indeed, that did not pick
it up, like South. Dakota did not pick it up because of the
tax problem because they

.1t they weren't going to get the

revenue to achieve that end.
The discussion is relatively clear — again I- am
thinking of the legislative history — that the coste, whatever
cost the addition of the court services and there is a dis­
cussion in the legislative history that this is dealing with
court-services — whatever additional costs that were going to
be involved in this would have to be borne by the states, that

13

Congress and the Department of the Interior was not going to
put in additional funds, v?as not going to fund this as a
separate matter.

That is why many states opted out and I think

that that was the intent is clear, whether the language may
not be sufficient we agree, but it is clearly unclear language
where the legislative history has to provide the backdrop for
reading it.

Otherwise —

QUESTION:

Mr. Becker, I am a little confused by

part of your argument.

I want you to straighten me out.

I

understood you to at one point indicate that the statute was
enacted in response to a request from the Indians and now I
understand you to be saying that it was up to the states to
opt to enter.

I may have misunderstood the first part of your

argument.
MR. BECKER:

That is correct.

in conjunction 'with the Indians.

The statute was adopted

There was — the Government

and the Indians did want a consent feature in the bill and
some of the original drafts of the bill had a consent feature.
In other words, the tribes would have to consent with
the state.
QUESTION:

What I am really interested in, so you

can explain it so that I understand it, is the principle on
which some stares are in and some are out, is that entirely up
to the states to make the decision or was there Indian
participation in the various decisions?

14
MR. BECKER.

In the initial — for the initial states,

each — tha Department of the Interior indicated that,

they

had conversations with both the state governments and the
tribes in those states and that on the five mandatory states
there was agreement except for the Reservations that were
exempted, Red Lake, Warm Springs and Menominee.
As far as the remaining states of the union who had
any Indian country that is defined by the statutes within a —
the statute, as finally enacted by the Congress in '53 did not
have a mandatory Indian consent feature.

There had been a

consent feature in the one draft and then a consultation
provision and that was dropped out eventually on the theory
that there would have to be consultation anyway which, in
effect, occurred, I think —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

L;0O o’clock, Mr. Becker.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon, a recess was
taken for luncheon until 1:00 o'clock p.m.J

15
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Becker, you may

continue.
MR. BECKER:

Thank you, your Honor.

As my response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question on
consent:

In 1968, Congress changed the consent feature of

the statute to make it mandatory that they charge consent to
the assumption of jurisdiction.

They did not alter the language

of the civil section or the criminal section at all so that
whatever the reading or

the reading was in '63, it was the

same in '68.
It seems to me almost beyond understanding for the
Congress to expect the tribes to consent to coining under what
the lower courts held to be essentially for the state juris­
diction if, in fact, that would subject their members to the
full panoply of the state's taxes.
QUESTION:

Well, the fact was, Mr. Berger, was it

not, that as of that time the taxability of the personal
property on Indian Reservations, both of Indians and of nonIndians was not at all settled.
MR. BECKER:

Isn't that, correct?

That is correct and that is why I think,

that the reading that the lower courts — that the state gives
it indicate that Congress somehow went through and understood
what the tax situation was and indicated that that was passed
by the state as well.

16

I think that it is clear from the history and knowing
that that questions was unclear and it was only partially
settled in 1973

that there was no discussion one way or

another about taxes and taxes as a concept, as an idea, were
excepted from this statute.

The statute basically has nothing

to do with taxes but B provis, which appears both on the
criminal side and on the civil side, seems to us is the kind of
a provision as was put in there to assuage, as we indicate,
that the Indian fears that there was any change in the trust
relationship and, secondly, that there would be no reason to
put that in on a criminal side.
Why would you pat a statute that says, exactly as if.
does

on a civil side, no taxes on trust property, no

alienation of land,, when, we are talking about an offense,
criminal offense jurisdiction?
not rise.

For the most part that would

The authority. to tax, if it came, would not come

from the authority over the criminal section, it coma because
of all civil laws being applicable and somebody fails to pay
and the failure to pay may be a criminal offense.

But -the

authority would come from the civil side and yet that appears
throughout the statute which indicates to me it was — I don't
want to call it a Congressional boilerplate, but a provision
that appears in other places as well to make it clear to the
Indians that they are not changing their status vis-a-vis the
Fede ra 1 Gove rriment.

17
Now, the way the state courts have read that is,
B in fact turns out to be the section by which you find the
authority.

Suppose Congress had not put B in there?

They

could have said, we don't have to worry about assuaging any
Indian

fears.

There is nothing they have to fear.

Right?

And they took B out and they didn't put it in,
And all you. have is the A section.

Right?

It would be

awful tough to read that as conveying taxing authority.

The

only way the state courts read it is by coning back in through
B and saying, wall, then, wfiy did they put B in if A didn’t
convey general taxing authority?
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the Supreme Court of

Minnesota's opinion seemed to go oh the idea that A was
ambiguous, when you talk about "All civil laws," but some light
i■ * thrown on .-.fcs meaning when you see S, which apparently
carves out otherwise existing authority to tax.
MR. BECKER;

Well, I think that they relied very

heavily on B as indicating their reading of A.

That is correct.

And without B being there, that they would have read A very
possibly as not conveying the taxing authority.
By gutting in B — and in our view Congress put in £
there as a help, as a method of persuading or assuring the
Indians that they would not be changed in their status vis-a-vis
the federal — that their trust relations, that the historic
federal trust responsibility would not be altered at all.

All

IS
that was happening was they were now getting a forum for
adjudication of criminal matters and civil matters r which is
what they wanted*
Now, to cone in and to say Congress, by putting in E
and telling them now that we are going to not change anything
has, in fact, slipped one by the Indians*

They slipped it by

because by putting in B, you read that as meaning A conveys
general taxing authority to the extent that B does not exempt
it and I think that is an awful burden to put on Congress in
terms of its general methodology of supposedly dealing within
the ends to some degree of good faith..
I think the only way to read that A/B the way the
state and the lower court does is, in fact, it was either
inadvertent,

/hich I doubt, or it was slipped by the tribes

and I don’t think that is true at all.
The tribes agree they knew what was happening to a
degree by the statute.

The language is not very good.

We

all agree that the language, "Civil cause of action and general
lav;" is not the best kind of language and somebody is going to
have to make, sense of it while it still stands but the one
thing it doesn’t seem to us that, it did was, convey general
taxing authority„
Another matter I would like raise —
QUESTION s

Is there any other kind of authority you

think it doesn’t convey other than taxing authority?

19
MK,. BECKER»
key problems.

Well, that, of course, is one of its

I don't know completely the answer to that.

I

think that arguments can be made in given cases that certain
other kinds of regulatory powers over matters that are
peculiarly involved with tribal life may not be conveyed but I
have nothing on which to work in this case

This cases deals

with taxes and taxes have always been treated as a special
case under federal law.

always been the special taxing jurisdiction requirement.
Congress has to expressly convey the authority.
There is no ether way to explain Squire versus Capo_einan- excapc
by virtue of

a special kind of taxing statute reading rule., if

you will, with regard to Indians.

So

on that sicle 1 think the

taxing part of it is clear.
What else is involved, 1 think we are going to have
to wait for some adjudication to take place and one of the
reasons it hasn't taken place, interestingly enough, is
because the states I think only rather recently caught on to
the fact that taxes may have been one of the things included.
This is the first case on 280 directly to reach this

me, an Indian who builds a home, has sufficient income to build
a home however small, and put a foundation in, is home-free
because his property cannot be taxed.

There is nc question.

But an Indian who buys a mobile home, you know, then
has to be judged by the number of bricks or blocks underneath
the home to determine whether it is attached.
Nov;, we don't think the federal law requires that.
We think B protects, in that instance, any kind of a thing, if
you will, used as a home on the trust land.

derations .

One is the statute itself.

legislative history.

The second is the

The third is the judicial decisions and

the fourth is the policy.
With respect to the statute itself, the Minnesota
Supreme Court and our position is that the statute g.rants the
authority to the states to have the civil laws that are of
general application apply ii Indian territory except that any
real or personal property that is held in trust by the United
States or is subject to a restriction against alienation
imposed by the United

States shall not be subject to taxation.

We are not talking about the excepted property in
this case.

We are talking about personal property which is

not held in trust and which is not subject to restriction
against alienation.
I'd like to come back -- perhaps this is a good time
to deal with the question of whether or not it is personal
property or real property.
If this mobile home were real property, it would be
exempt from taxation under the provisions of this statute.
This case wg.s tried from the beginning on the assumption that
what we are talking about here is a tax on person.?.! property.
It has not been contended in the District Court nor
in the Minnesota Supreme Court or until now that this mobile
home, for the purposes of this litigation.,, constitutes real

25
property but as I say, if this Court were to assume that this
issue were open in the case, which I don’t believe it is, and
we were to assume that this mobile home is real property and
not personal property, the statute exempts that property from
taxation«

There is no question siboufc it.
At any rate, that is our reading of the statute.
Secondly, as far as the Congressional history, the

legislative history, we have examined it very carefully and it
is not helpful.

There is nothing we were able to find in the

Congressional hearings where this question of the taxation,
whether the states were being granted authority to subject
the Indians to these taxes was definitively discussed by any­
body so I am afraid that we just can ’ t have any

there is no

help for us in the legislative history of this case.
As far as the judicial decisions are concerned, we
have four: the Minnesota District Court, the Minnesota Supreme
Court, the Federal District Court in Nebraska

in the Peters

case which was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
We have only these four

judicial decisions.

They

each hold that Public Law 280 does grant to the states the
authority and jurisdiction to tax the Indians, except for the
excepted property which I have mentioned.
QUESTIONS

Has the Ninth Circuit gene the other way.

Mr. Luther?
hhh LUTHER:

Not to my knowledge, your Honor.

26

QUESTION:
MR» LUTHER:

Not in the Santa Rosa case?
No, your Honor.

That was quite a

different issue before the Court in that case.
QUESTION:
here?

And what other taxes might be involved

Income taxes?
MR. LUTHER:

Yes, your Honor.

Income tax was the

issue in the 'Paters case.
QUESTION:
gasoline tax?

Arid how about gasoline — the state

Hovr about sales tax?

MR. LUTHER:

Sales tax?

Well, to answer your

question, if your question is, what taxes do I contend that
this Public Law 280 authorises the states to levy, yes, sales
tax, income tax, gasoline tax —•
QUESTION:

You -could say any tax of general

applicability.
MR. LUTHER:

,
Yes, sir.

Yes, your Honor, any tax

except those on the property and the trust property itself.
Or on restricted Indian property.
QUESTION:
MR. LUTHER:
QUESTION:
MR. LUTHER5

I suppose you have a state gasoline tax.
Yes, we do.
Is it being collected on the Reservation?
Yes, it is,.

Sales tax also.

And the

income tax, too.
QUESTION:
MF\, LUTHER:

Inheritance?
1 don't know, your Honor.

That —

27
QUESTION:

Of course,, that could be property, I mean,

trust property.
MR. LUTHER:

'Well, the Indians are so impoverished

that it is doubtful that the inheritan.ce tax would apply.
QUESTION:
MR. LUTHERs

How about personal property tax?
Well, this is the personal property tax

that we are talking about.
QUESTION:
MR. LUTHER:

That is what I thought.
I

might mention that this is a rarity

because the personal property tax is no longer operative in the
S'';ate of Minnesota except with respect to certain property
such as mobile homes which are taxed as personal property
because they are so frequently on leased land that it isn't
administratively feasible to tax them as real property.

Other

than that, there are no personal property taxes administered.
QUESTION:

But on the trust, land you could not tax

the land.
MR. LUTHER:
not

You are absolutely right, sir, we could

tax the land.
QUESTION;

Well, could you tax the furniture in the

home on the land?
MR. LITHE?:

If we had

a personal property tax which

was applicable to that kind of personal property, yes.
QUESTION:
MR. LUTHER;

You just couldn't tax the building?
You can't tax the land itself or the

28
building which is part of the land in the sense that it is
real property„
QUESTION:
MR. LUTHER;
QUESTION;

But anything else»
Yes.
Of course, defending the taxing power to

the state isn’t quite responsive to the need that was being
expressed at the time, is it?
MR, LUTHER;

I mean —

No- your Honor, X don't believe it is.

X think X would agree with Mr. Backer that this legislation,
this Public Law 280 when it started out, it started out as a
very —- it started out it was going to be applicable only to
the State of California and only to certain Indians in the
State of California.
QUESTION:

And the problem that precipitated the

issue was the lack of remedy and the lack of standards.
MR. LUTHER;

Well, X think the problem that precipi­

tated it was it started out with a criminal statute, essen­
tially and as it. progressed through the Congress, it expanded in
its

scope and it expanded from merely a criminal — subjecting

the

Indians to- the state criminal law and state jurisdiction

on criminal matters, to civil, which is the section that, we are
speaking of and then that expanded and progressed to the point
where it included not only giving the Indians access to the
j -Uu .<ww

state courts tor civil litigation purposes
QUESTIONs

*'

Making them susibject to rules.

29
MR. LUTHER:

Exactly.

Which it may be appropriate

now to bring up the fourth point that I want to bring up, which
is the policy question.
The express

policy of Congress at the time this lav?

was enacted was one of integration of the Indians into the
community

integration arid assimilation and this law was a

step, as the courts have all mentioned, this Public Law 280 was
a step toward effecting that Congressional policy of assimila­
tion and integration and I wish to make this very clear that
in considering and in construing this law that policy be kept
in mind.
Statewise, we have a policy consideration, too, and
that is the Indians are citizens of the state,

They have all

the rights and all the privileges of all the other citizens of
the state and as a matter of policy we feel it only just — and
perhaps this is what Congress had in mind — only just and
proper that they bear their fair share of the expenses of the
state.
New, of course, the biggest tax impact on people of
this kind is the tax on their real property, and that property
is not taxable.

It never has been and is not specifically

excluded from taxation in this law.

But, why should not these

citizens of the state who are enjoying all the rights and
privileges of all the other citizens of the state share in
tne expenses, at least to the extent of these 1
.esser taxes

30
which we have talked about, the sales tax, the gas tax,
personal property tax,
QUESTION:

I suppose that same argument could have

been made in. McClanahan?
MR. LUTHER'

Yes, your Honor, it could have been made

in McClanahan, but McClanahan didn’t

have Public Law 280 and

this is, of course, the major difference because our position
is that Public Law 280 authorizes — grants its jurisdiction to
the state and Public Law 280 did not apply in the McClanahan
case.

It didn’t apply
QUESTION:

please?

to Arizona.

General Luther, may I ask you a question,

Is it your view that the selection of the states that

originally were going to be subject to the law of 280, that
various lands were subject, were they chosen on the grounds
that they were more ready for assimilation and those were
higher-developed areas?

Or were they areas where there was a

greater breakdown of law and order and therefore a greater
need for state criminal jurisdiction?
MR. LUTHER;:
QUESTION;

Or is it clear?

I am not clear on that, your Honor.
It might make quite a difference on

whether you think they are ready to pay their- share.of the
taxes or not — which view you take.
MR. LUTHER:

Yes, I suppose it would.

don't know that much about it.
QUESTION:

I think it was because they had

In

other words, they were able to handle their problems internally
tribally where these other tribes didn't have as effective
an organization.

That is my understanding.

QUESTION;

Well, if that were so, then that is a

partial answer to the question posed by Mr. Justice Stevens, I
suppose.
MR. LUTHER:

Yes.

Yes.

Maybe.

Now, if there cire no further questions, that is all
I have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD P. BECKER, ESQ.
MR. BECKER:

Thank you, your Honor.

Let me respond to just a number of things.
As far as the gasoline and sales tax, the Buck Act
passed by Congress a number of years ago authorizes the
imposition and collection of both sales and gasoline taxes on
Indian Reservations or in other federal enclaves, military
reservations

-Vj S--1s" Act — it is not at all clear

whether the Sales Act part of it makes it applicable to
Indians buying from traders or from —

to

QUESTION:

In the absence — how about the sales tax

on a reservation, absent 280?
MR. BECKER:
Clearly no.

Absent 280?

In a sale to an Indian?

The question is still open.

QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION;
MR. BECKER:

Despite the Buck Act.
Despite the Buck Act.
All right.
As far as

the other point I'd like to

make, as far as Red Lake is concerned, I think Red Lake and
Warm Springs and Menominee were specifically exempted out
because they did have ongoing tribal governments and they were,
if the idea is that this statute should be read against an
assiraiiationist, termina tionist background.. then you would
think that Congress would pick for termination of assimilation
those tribes that had advanced over the pupilage state which
was, you know, the concept in Tragama and the older cases as to
what the government was supposed to be doing.
Yet, in fact, it was only the tribe in the areas
where the tribes were the least developed, where there was
less development that 280 was made mandatorily applicable and
the reservations that were furthest advanced had the greatest
assets.

Menominee and Warm Springs were exempted from this.
QUESTION:

Well, that is consistent, is it not?

I

mean, if the — even under an assimilative integration policy
to the extent that there was a great strong tribal

identification you might mitigate that policy a little bit and
to the extent that there wasn't, you would pursue the policy,

QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

Well —
Now, of course, the policy has changed.
Oh, yes.
Or since 1953 it changed and the whole

policy now is to preserve the integrity of the tribes and so on.
MR. BECKER:

My problem is I am not even sure you can

necessarily read this as, you know, a terminationist statute.
Obviously, the House has the Resolution there.
nothing T can do to make it go away.

There is

But this statute itself,

you know, was something significantly less them a terminationist
or assimilationist statute.

One can make the argument that it

was designed to help the tribal governments along over a
difficult period by allowing the C provision and authorizing
the courts as vehicles for bringing about some level of order
so that something —

That it did.

it worked a major change of subjecting the Indians to state
taxes, to the full panoply of state taxes.

That would have

tribes and it just doesn't, come up anywhere in the legislative
history.
