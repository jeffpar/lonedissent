MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

r'7e will hear arguments

next in No. 74-532, McKinney v. Alabama.
Mr. Smith, you may precede whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is a case started back in. 1970 when a
Mobile judge — Mobile, Alabama which is approximately 265
miles from the City of Birmingham, in a civil proceedings,
found a publication among a series of publications to be
obscene under the law as it was beinrr interpreted at that
time.

This was a civil proceeding aaainst a bookstore

operator in Mobile.
This would have been in approximately February,
I believe, of 1970.
Pardon?
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

The bookstore was not operated by —
Not the Petitioner nor was there

any allegation of a relationship,

your Honor, directly or

indirectly.
Then, shortly after the proceedings in Mobile,
the Assistant Attorney General of the State, Mr. Barnes, I

4
believe, walked into Petitioner's bookstore in Birmingham
and handed him a letter to advise him that certain publica­
tions were obscene and had been found obscene by a judge in
Mobile.

Now —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

May I ask —
Yes, sir.
— some questions.

Was there any

appeal from the Mobile judgment?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

It was conceded that there

was none and of course, our Petitioner was not in any way
involved.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

I understand that.
Yes, sir.
The second question:

What was the

burden of proof in the Mobile litiaation?
MR. SMITH:

It would have been the civil burden

of proof and that is to say —
QUESTION:

Well, what was it, not what it would

have been?
MR. SMITH:
the evidence.

I am told it was the preponderance of

I was not privvy.

There was no appeal.

There was no transcript written up at that case and of
course, our decision didn't come down from the Supreme
Court of Alabama until May of 1974,long after —
QUESTION:

But was it by preponderance of the

5

evidence?
MR. SMITH:

Preponderance of the evidence.

That

is all that is required in any civil proceeding under
Alabama law and there is no reason to believe it is to the
contrary and at the time of Mr. Ferris Ritchey, Counsel,
questioning Mr, Charlie Barnes, at the time of the pro­
ceedings in this case, he tried to get into what happened
at the trial and the judge said that was not relevant any
more so he foreclosed him from having an opportunity to go
into any issues whatsoever so we can take, T believe, the
presumption that it was a civil burden of proof and that
is a preponderance of the evidence.
QUESTION:

Does that mean, Mr. Smith, that had

Mr. McKinney in some way been associated or involved in the
Mobile proceedings, you would still be here today?
MR. SMITH:
issue.

On that issue, yes, sir, on that

But I think our position would be, whereas we are

arguing, let's say, one of three or four factors today, we
would be foreclosed from several of them.
Well, as I said, on March 10th, 1970, the
Attorney General went in, as I said, Mr. Barnes, and gave a
)

letter to Mr. McKinney.
Approximately a couple of weeks later, they
went back in, Mr. Barnes together with an investigator and
found one of the publications on this list of approximately

6

10 were still on the racks available for sale and whereupon
they purchased it and shortly thereafter filed a complaint.
Now, the notice provision —
QUESTION:

Would it make any difference if it

was one or 10?
MR. SMITH:

No, I'm •— well, your Honor, some­

where along in the Attorney General's brief he says that
this is a reckless disregard.

He was given notice and he

didn't find all 10 publications there.
saying.

That is what I am

So we are talking about one out of 10 of the

publications.
He may have had all 10.
10.

I don't know.

He may not have had all

I was just making that as the fact that

he wasn't recklessly laying everything out that had been
found obscene down in Mobile and said, okay, now do what
you want.

That is not the kind of attitude he was pre­

senting.
So this letter was given under the provisions of
the 1969 Act.

The 1969 Act, your Honors, is found at -- I

think, page 40

of the brief and argument of Respondent

reply to arnici

curiae in the appendices and on page 46,

under C —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

What color is that brief?
That is white, sir — "Brief and.

Argument of the Respondent and Reply

page 46, Section 2,

7
subparagraph (c) .

This .is the only time this statute has

got anything to do with this case, because they talk about
the fact -- and this is sort of an inclusion in here —
"Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to mailable
matter unless such mailable matter is known by such a
person to have been judicially found to be obscene —"
okay -- "under the provisions of any ... Alabama statute."
Okay, that, and, of course, Section 6 on page 47
says, "The provisions of this Act are cumulative and shall
be in addition to any and all —" other laws that are
enacted.
Curiously enough, this case was decided May 9,
1974.

On May 9, 1974, the Alabama Supreme Court, in a

decision in another case, said that notice provision was
unconstitutional because that represented a prior restraint,
much like the Bantam Books decision of this Court in a by­
gone era.
QUESTION;

Which was that?

Section 6, that you

said they found unconstitutional.
MR. SMITH:

The Section 2(c).

And Section 4,

your Honor.
)

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Found which?
Section 4.
That's the one that was found —
Section 4 was found.

Yes, that’s

8
correct, section 4,

I'm sorry, was found, which also has

the notice provision and they found that unconstitutional
on the same day in th© case of Ballew versus the State of
Alabama.

That was case number 480 and that was in a

decision by the Court.
So this gentleman, Mr. McKinney, was tried under
the provisions of a different law and that was a law that
was enacted in 1961 and I direct your attention, your
Honors, to page 20 of the Brief and Argument in Opposition
to Petition for Writ of Certiorari, also white.
And this is a section which permits a civil
equity proceeding whereby an injunction can be obtained
against the dissemination of a particular publication found
to be obscene.
QUESTION:
Mr. Smith?

Now, what are you telling us,

This is the statute under which the Mobile

proceedings was *—
MR. SMITH:

This is the statute under which

Mr. McKinney was convicted.
QUESTION:

Oh, so —

MR. SMITH:

Notice provision was given pursuant

to the 1969 Act but as I say, that is the last time we deal
with the 1969 Act.

We get back into the '61 Act which is

really what we are here before the Court today saying is
unconstitutional.

9

QUESTION:

And we are talking now about the

Section 4 appearing cn page 20.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, correct.
And that is the — what you have

given us so far is really a preamble to this, isn’t it?
MR. SMITH:
two sections.

Correct.

And I merely say there are

There are two remedies that can be applied.

There is a civil provision which reaches under Section 11
on page 25, your Honors and then there is — and that is,
of course, punishable by contempt and then there is the
criminal provisions and penalties which is Section 4 under
page 20 and —
QUESTION:

And the crime there, I take it, is

not selling an obscene material but selling some material
that has been declared to be obscene.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:

That is right.
At least, that is what it says on

its face.
MR. SMITH: ’’Any mailable matter known by such
person to have been judicially found to be obscene under
this Act."
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:

Where were you reading that from?
At page 20, your Honor.
The same —
No, sir, that is the"Brief and

10

Argument in Opposition.11

The other white one.

It is Section 4

That's it.

(1) and halfway down the page,

your Honor and it starts, "Or any mailable matter known by
such person to have been judicially found to be obscene
under this Act, shall be guilty of misdemeanor —"
QUESTION:

And that was the conviction in this

case.
MR. SMITH:

Correct.

Now, for which Mr. Mc­

Kinney received 515 days for failing to pay his fines, a
365-day sentence and 19 days for court costs.
QUESTION:

And it was the letter, was it, that

gave him the required notice?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That it had been held obscene.
Correct, sir.
So as Justice White said, the question

of obscenity is not before us, but only the question of
whether he had noticed that it had been held to be obscene
in the

Mobile court — the Mobile proceeding.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

of course, is present.

You say before your Honors?
Yes.
Well —
That is the question, is it not?
We think the question of obscenity,
We think the statute is

11
unconstitutional because he did not have a chance to liti­
gate the question of obscenity and wa say, for example —
now, here is a part of the confusion about the Mobile
decree.

Now, taking my Appendix, which we take a page 100 QUESTION:

Now, your

Appendix, you mean this

one?
MR. SMITH:
101.

Yes, sir, the Appendix, page 100 and

Wa have the State's Exhibit Number D and under that,

if you look down there, the State of Alabama versus, we
see several magazines and one of which is entitled "New
Directions," No. 14 Volume 4, No. 4 and over in the decree
they say that "New Directions" No. 16 Volume 4, No. 4 is
obscene.
So I am saying that we start out with confusion
from the wording of the decree or the heading of the
decree as well as the inconsistency in the decree.
QUESTION:

Suppose state law says, "It shall be

a criminal offense for any person to sell any material as
human food that has been declared to be unfit for human
consumption by any court of the state," and a gentleman is
given notice in a letter that this material which I see on
1

your shelf here has been declared to be unfit and the man
sells it anyway and he is charged with a crime.
Do you think he then has to have the opportunity
to prove — may he demand that the state prove again

12
that food is unfit?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir, I don't think so but I think

this Court has already said that in cases in which you have
distinguished any requirement as scienter —*
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Y@s.
-- between First Amendment matters

and matters of scienter.
QUESTION:

So you really aren't relying on this

typical criminal law ox* res adjudicata.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
You are saying that the First

Amendment •—
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Correct.
— requires that in this prosecution —
That obscenity be allowed to be

litigated and it was not allowed to be litigated in this
question.
Now, Counsel suggests in his brief that at the
time that the publication was offered into evidence,
Mr. Ferris Ritchey objected.

Well, Mr. Ritchey objected

because at the beginning of the case we had, first, a
demurrer filed challenging the constitutionality of the law,
which was denied.

We had a motion to quash challenging

the constitutionality of law,which was denied, going into
this issue and even during the proceedings, when Mr. Ritchey

13

was trying to get into some factors in his argument? at page
81 of my Appendix the Court says, halfway down the page, "I
think I can cut your argument short.
about it.

I have been thinking

This Court is not going to turn over nny question

to the jury as to whether or not any magazine is obscene,"
and here there is a charge the man sold"a certain magazine,
that that had heretofore been adjudicated as obscene.
"The Court is of the opinion and so rules, that
the magazine .... would be evidence of ...purchase—" and
they say for that reason he will allow it to be introduced
into evidence but he said, "The Court feels that it would
be the Court's duty to limit the purpose for which the
magazine is admitted and to instruct the jury not to
determine any questions of obscenity of the magazine."
And later on, the judge goes on to say that "This
is not a jury question.

Time and time again the question of

obscenity in this case is now a question of law.

It is

no longer a question of facts."
QUESTION:

Then you would be making this argument,

and you are making the argument, even on the assumption that
the magazine in this case was precisely the same issue as
declared obscene in F-ipbile?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Correct.
Yes.
Because of the

for a variety of

14

reasons.
QUESTION:

You are going so fast that you are

losing me.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Go back to what you were on a few

minutes ago, if you look at page A.1Q0 of the Appendix and
you see that the caption of the case is the State of
Alabama against, among others, "New Directions"No. 14,
Volume 4, No. 4 and then you pointed out, over on page 101
that the holding, the judgment is against "New Directions"
No. 16, Vol. 4, No. 4.

Now what, if anything, are you

making out of that?
MR. SMITH:

I am saying that it would be a

confusion if someone would have to rely upon, to verify and
rely upon the concept of the heading of the style of the
case down in Mobile.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

One cf —
Well —
-- the points we make, your Honor

is, for example —
QUESTION:

I just wonder what are you making out

of that which you have called our attention to?
MR. SMITH:

If a defendant, as Mr. McKinney is

here, wanted to verify;he just gets a letter, doesn't get
any really substantive facts, he gets a letter and he says,
"Under the decision of the Court in suchandsuch a case and

15
this number, this publication was found obscene," I am
merely pointing out that there would be some confusion if
he were to get a copy of the decree —
QUESTION:

Well, what is the magazine that was

picked up in the city store?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Was that 14 Volume 4?

That’s 16, your Honor.
That is 16, Volume 4.
Yes, sir.
And that is what he got the notice

about.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Sixteen.
Yes, sir.
And that is what the judgment was

about.
MR. SMITH:

Correct, sir.

QUESTION:

Sixteen.

MR. SMITH:

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

So that really, I hope you are net

trying to get much mileage out of that.
MR. SMITH:

No, I am not, your Honor.

I am

only saying that there was some confusion that could
exist in the minds of -—
QUESTION:

Well, I'd be interested in what your

arguments are and what you are relying on.

16

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

Now, at the time of this

decision — strike that.
At the time of the prosecution of Mr. McKinney,
the Alabama lav?

as interpreted by the Court of Criminal

Appeals — and had not been changed or modified — with
regard to the extent of community standards — unlike what
this Court, or people were saying the Court was saying —
was the community from which the jury was drawn.
So in the City of Birmingham versus Jones, 45
Alabama Appellate 86 in 1969, Judge Cates said, and I quote,
"The Community standard is to be measured by the area from
which the jury veniremen are drawn."
Now, that is Birmingham!! 265 miles away and a
different burden of proof, we have Mobile, Alabama.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Smith.
Yes, sir?
Maybe I am wrong, but I thought what

you were arguing here — and I might tell you in all
candor it is the issue which particularly interests me -—
is whether there may be a criminal conviction based upon
this finding in a civil proceeding, whether it is 265 miles
away or somewhere else •—■
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
-- reached on a preponderance of

evidence in a case to which the criminally accused is not a

party, whether it is compatible with due process, to
convict a man of a crime in that circumstance,

And I

thought that is what —•
MR. SMITH:

That is one of the arguments, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:

Well, I hope it is the one you will

give most of your attention to as far as I am concerned.
You have been here several times before —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.
We have been all through these other
Yes, sir.
— questions that you raise.
I was trying to give background to

this Court.
QUESTION:

I can understand that you were.

QUESTION:

But to argue that, you have to first

convince somebody that •— including the majority of the
Court — that the issue of obscenity has to be in the
criminal case.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Because the statute on its face

doesn't make an issue out of —- doesn't make obscenity an
issue and you have to say that it is an issue.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, we say,

first, obscenity

should have been an issue and the statute is unconstitutional

because the defendant would be denied his right to a trial
by jury on a material element of the offense ■— the alleged
offense here»

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
says.

What material element?
It would be obscenity.
Well, that isn't what the statute

been declared to be obscene.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, but in a proceeding where

a man is not entitled to a jury.

Alabama, in which it was determined Playboy was obscene in
a civil proceeding in which somebody consented to it, theit
would have been a judicial declaration of obscenity
because there was a consent order and someone who may have
sold Playboy in Huntsville, Alabama after being given
notice would be denied a jury trial.
QUESTION:

What is the difference between this

case and the food case I gave you?
MR. SMITH:
Honor.

You would say that —

We have no scienter here, your

We have not allowed for the man to have exercised

the right of scienter.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no — scienter is a —■

QUESTION:

He was given notice.

QUESTION:

He was given absolute notice of what

19

the crime — of the elements of this crime.

He was told

that this — and it is true — that this particular
publication had been declared obscene in the court.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now, he knew that.
He was told that.
And the statute,says if you sell one

of those things you are guilty of a crime.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, and we say that in the

concept consistent with due process, that he should be
allowed to litigate the issue of obscenity by virtue of the
denial of the jury trial, the denial of the right of
confrontation, the point that I made about the difference
of application of a different local community standard we
have that is involved and implicated here and there is just
he is not allowed to have any scienter.
Now, in Kingsley Books versus Brown, you all
said it was in a case in where the man was part of the same
proceeding.

He was given his civil notice.

Later on the

statute excluded him from being able to raise, as a question
of scienter, his lack of knowledge as to the issues obscene.
So if the publication were found obscene in a
criminal case, his scienter was gone.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Smith —
Yes.

20

QUESTION:

I still would like to hear again your

answer to Justice White’s question as to how you distinguish
this from the food ease.

Is it because this is in the

First Amendment area and food is not?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, I said —
Is that the difference?
It is one of the differences, the

principal difference, I think, because we are dealing with
the penumbra of the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, what -- is there any other

difference?
MR. SMITH:

The tainted food, your Honor, would

have been scientifically, I suppose, determined to have
been tainted and unfit for human consumption.

I don't think

we are dealing, in the printed word or pictures, that we
are talking about things which are so capable of exact
determination and the public welfare requires that tainted
food be immediately removed from the marketplace, lest
somebody get sick and somebody fall ill and die or such
like that.

We are not dealing with the same compelling

urgency.
QUESTION:

But if the gentleman who is’ told of

it says, "I wasn’t a party to that proceeding.

Bad scientists.

there was bnly the civil

Terrible

And furthermore,

only the civil standard was

21
there.

I am sure that nobody could convince a jury beyond

a reasonable doubt that food — that this is not fit
human consumption."

for

So he goes ahead and sells it.

And he tries to, in certain of the case, the
issue of whether the food is fit or not and the Court tells
him that that is not the issue here.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
The issue is whether you sold some­

thing that you knew had been declared to be unfit.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

If you take Section 11, your Honor and you read
Section 11, the injunction provision, Mr. McKinney could
not have been found to have been in contempt, applying the
injunction provision — could not have been found guilty of
contempt if he had sold the publication unless he had been
a named party to the case.

'

‘ .

But yet, in a criminal matter, without hctving a
chance to litigate the question of obscenity, he can be
found obscene.

He can be not permitted to show the

difference in community standard to a jury of his peers and
be ah3.® to try to ascertain that issue and I think that's the
difference, the key difference between the food matter which
you suggest and the other matter.
QUESTION:

Do you find any comfort fox* your

position in the dissent of Chief Justice Heflin?

22

MR. SMITH:

Well, of course, yes, we do.

We

think that Chief Justice Heflin —■
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, what was that?
— has —
Well, of course, his approach was a

little different from that which you have been giving us,
I think.
MR. SMITH: Chief Justice Heflin, of course,
has taken the three points that I mentioned, that is, that,
number one, there was no trial by jury permitted this man.
This man received a sentence of one year plus fine.

That,

certainly, under the decisions of this Court, that the man
should ba entitled to a trial by jury and he was not
entitled to a trial by jury on that issue of obscenity.
And we say that that — that is one of the points,
I think, he talks about.

He also talks about the burden

of proof.
QUESTION: Well, do I misread him as having
suggested that

under our decision in Winship, every element

of the criminal offense has to be proved by the —MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Beyond a reasonable doubt.
Beyond a reasonable doubt and that

the deficiency in this conviction was that the element of
obscenity was not.
MR. SMITH:

It was excluded by legislative fiat.

23
That is correcte
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, supposing you have an

ordinance that proscribes parking in an area where there is
a no

parking sign and you have done that and you go into

court and you say, well, I have got a right to relitigate
the question of whether there should have been a no parking
sign there because that is an element of the offense.
Isn't it open to the state, at least in that
case, to 3ay, that simply isn't open.
element of the offense.

That is not an

The presence of the sign alone

makes the only element of the offense, did you park there
or didn't you?
MR. SMITH:

Well, most states treat parking

offenses, your Honor, in a different category, I think,
than an absolute criminal statute so I think that that
becomes an ordinance more often than not, as versus the
statute and secondly, I do think it would be open for some­
one to come in challenge the city council’s right to have
passed that ordinance in the event that it vrent beyond the
enabling clause granted them by the legislature so I think
there would be other grounds.
QUESTION:
clause.

Well, perhaps beyond the enabling

But would they be able to relifeigate in court the

question of whether the city council should have decided fcheifc
that was a no parking space?

24

MR. SMITH:

Assuming all of the things had been

foreclosed and there were no other -- there was no bottom
line, yes, I don’t think he would be able to relitigate
that question.

But that is as to a matter involving a

no parking sign.
But here we are talking again -- and this Court
has time and time said again that these questions regarding
explicit material or simulated material depends on the
difference between communities, as the Chief Justice has
pointed out, I think, in the Miller case, regarding the
difference in various communities and different state
communities to the tolerance of material and I think here
one of the things is, he was not allowed to litigate this
under the Birmingham standard and, of course, the right of
confrontation Justice Heflin refers to was also denied
counsel in this particular case and the law in Alabama is
clear,that in a judgment in a civil suit cannot be
admitted in a criminal prosecution arising out of the same
transaction so we have one standard that applies to the
same parties in the case and yet another standard if it is
going to apply to somebody who had no participation whatso­
ever directly or indirectly in the litigation and we 3ay
that that is the explicit difference in this case and even
Justice Heflin, in pointing out what Judge Harwood said —
on page A14 of our Appendix — Now Justice Harwood said,

25
"It is clearly settled by the doctrines of our cases that
a judgment gained in a civil suit is not admissible
against the defendant in a criminal prosecution growing out
of the same transaction."
But Justice Harwood found no difficulty in
joining the prosecution or the majority of the panel and
Judge Faulkner's decision in this case.
I'd like to reserve whatever time I have left
for rebuttal, if it please the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Marston.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH G. L. MARSTON, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. MARSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Rather than chance forgetting it, I would like
to respond to something Counsel pointed out, this point in
the Appendix where Judge Gibson told Mr. McKinney's counsel,
"I think I can cut your argument short."
QUESTION:

What page?

MR. MARSTON:
middle of the page.

Counsel cites —

Page 80.

A81, in the precise

"(The Court) I think I can cut your

argument short.*
Counsel argues that that shows that the trial
judge was flatly refusing to consider any question of

26
obscenity.

We don't -— the statement has to be taken in

context and the context was that this was the point in the
trial where the state offered this magazine into evidence
at Mr. McKinney's trial without any bounds.

The state

simply offered it in evidence and Mr. McKinney's counsel
objected on the grounds that obscenity was not for the jury
and judge heard some arguments and then he told counsel,
"I think I can cut your argument short."
In effect, I sustain your objection.
let that question go to the jury.

I will not

I will let the magazine

in on the issue of sale alone.
So I would call that to the Court's attention.
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that, he had.

the opportunity to litigate it and he not only avoided it,
but insisted on avoiding it?
MR. MARSTON:

Yes, sir, frankly.

I believe —

now, I believe there are —
QUESTION:

But did he really insist that before

you put this to the jury, Mr. Judge, you have got to decide
what it constitutes.

That is what the Constitution requires.

Is that what he was saying?
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I. —

That was the basis of his objection.

It was not, as I understand it, that anything related to
that civil proceeding in Mobile, was it?

27
MR. MARSTON:

No, sir.

I believe his objection

was that the question of obscenity was simply not to the
jusry in this case.

It was not a question of fact.

QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. MARSTON:

Now, I will say this about the

question of obscenity in this criminal prosecution.

Under

Jenkins versus Georgia it seems to me that where you have a
determination of obscenity that is outlandish, where the
material clearly is not obscene, that any court confronted
with that has a right and a duty

to go into that and I

think we see this in Mr. Justice Faulkner’s decision?
they write at length about what "New Directions" contained
and I think they did review and see if there was a question.
■

•

v

..

of obscenity at least.
Now, I am not saying that you open up the whole
thing and go back and start all over but you can look, the
Court would be under a duty to look at the material and
see if at least arguably there is a question of obscenity.
QUESTION:

But the judge said specifically the

jury could not do that.
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

That is right, sir, in response to

I don’t care "in response to."

is what they told the jury.

That

The judge said, "This is no

question for the jury.”
MR. MARSTON:

That was in response, though, to

28

Mr. McKinney’s objection.

He said, "I will do this in

answer to youx‘ objection.

I sustain your objection.

is what X will do.

This

I will give these instructions.'’

QUESTION;

Well, what are you going to charge

him with, voluntary assumption of risk, or something?
That was the judge’s rule and I don't care who provoked it.
MR. MARSTON;
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, that was his —

But he didn’t want that ruling,

did he?
MR. MARSTON;

Well, he objected and when the

judge said, "This is what I'll do," he didn’t object to it.
QUESTION;

Well, he didn’t object to it

because he wanted to go into the factual part of obscenity.
MR. MARSTON;

I don't read the record that way,

Mr. Justice Marshall,
QUESTION;

Well, that is the way the judge ruled.

The judge said, "We feel that it would be the court’s duty
to limit the purpose."

Just before that he says,"to any

question of obscenity in the magazine."
MR. MARSTON;

"Any question.S!

In response to Mr. McKinney's

objection that obscenity was not for the jury.

The judge

was agreeing with him.
In addition, when the judge gave these charges
to the jury, Mr. McKinney made no objection at all.
QUESTION;

Mr. Marston —

29
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I don't want to prolong discussion

as to what the language means, but the first full paragraph
on A81 which contains the objection by counsel, I read it
as. objecting to allowing the jury to see the magazine
without the introduction of evidence on behalf of the
defendant as to whether or not it v/as obscene.
The objection really was to the denial of the
right to litigate before that jury the issue of obscenity.
MR. MARSTON:

Yes, X think that was his

objection, that the question of obscenity was not for this
jury.
Is that what you are saying?
QUESTION:

Only because the judge refused to

allow any evidence as to whether or not the magazine was
obscene because the judge took a position that already
had been determined.
MR. MARSTON:

Well, sir, I do not believe this

record contains any reference except in response to this
objection which Mr. McKinney made, any reference to the
judge saying that the

question of obscenity was not

involved in here at all.
However, we defend the statute on that basis,
assuming the correctness of Petitioner’s analysis.
Now, the Petitioner relies very heavily on

30

Smith versus California saying there's no snowing of
scienter in this case.

There is no requirement for

scienter, he says,
I frankly don’t know what to say in response to
these arguments,

I don’t know if I understand them.

statute requires scienter in two forms.

This

The accused must

know the nature of the contents of the publication and
that complies with Smith, as I read Smith.
But then the statute says he must also know,
have actual knowledge, of the prior judicial determination
and both of these factors were proven.

We attempted to

prove some other things that would have shown scienter,
we think.

But on Mr. McKinney’s objection they were kept

out.
But if we didn't prove scienter in this case, it
is just not possible for the state to prove scienter.

We

h mded him a written notice stating "These materials have
been judicially declared obscene — " the case number, the
date and the court.
Now, I don't know what we can do beyond that.
Then, just before the sale, he was shown the
contents so I can’t say anything about scienter except
it was required and proven-.
Now, this Honorable Court has ruled on numerous
occasions that the obscenity of a material arises out of

31
the thing itself.

It is a -- the word "obscenity”

describes its nature and if it has that nature, it is
unprotected by the First Amendment.
QUESTIONs

Mew —

May something under our cases be

obscene in Mobile and not obscene in Birmingham?
MR. MARSTON:

Yes, sir, if the community

involved is the county.
Mow, under this statute the community is the
state.

And this was specifically held by the Alabama

Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Well, now, who

is the ultimate ~~

for purposes of constitutional jurisprudence, who finally
decides what the community is?
MR, MARSTON:

•• '

The Alabama Supreme Court f in the

case of —
QUESTION:

They do?

MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You mean, we are concluded by it?

MR. MARSTON:

Oh.

Oh.

Well, your Honor, this

Honorable Court has held in Hamling and in Miller and other
cases that the state may use a state standard or a smaller
standard.

Now, in our statutes that don’t use this prior

civil proceeding, we use a smaller community for the purposes
of banning it.
Of course, the First Amendment would protect all

32
of it without regard but the Supreme Court of Alabama has
held that the standard — the community under this statute
is the state as a whole.
We argue in brief that since the nature of the
material is the issue when we are talking about obscenity
that an in rem proceeding is most appropriate to determine
it.

Now, the Petitioner argues that he was not confronted

by his accusers.

He was not proven guilty beyond a

reasonable doubt.
But this argument totally ignores the peculiar
corpus delicti of his crime.

As I think has already been

pointed out, he was not charged and he is not convicted
with merely selling obscenity.

He is charged with selling

materials that had been judicially declared obscene -judicially found to be obscene and his crime has overtones
of contempt of court.
Now, I am not saying that he is guilty of
contempt of court but it is

that sort of a crime, the

disregard of this judicial determination.
!'I don't care, what the judge says, I am going to
»9

go on and sell it.
And with regard to the corpus delicti of his
crime, he confronted each witness, cross-examined each
witness and was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The jury was thoroughly charged on reasonable

33
doubt and the corpus delicti by the trial judge.
QUESTION.

Absent an objection from Mr. Smith,

would the issue of obscenity been submitted to the jury?
MR. MARS TON:

Not to the jury, r>.o, sir.

As I

read this statute and the Alabama --- now, at that time,
Mr. Chief Justice - I am really answering your question
academically because I don't know.
At that time we weren’t sure about the instruction.
QUESTION:

Well, I got the impression that you

were suggesting that Mr. Smith had some responsibility for
keeping this issue away from the jury.
MR. MARSTON:

Well, I am not Mr. Smith, but

Mr, McKinney's counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, the man who was trying the case.

MR. MARSTON:

I think it was.

I think they did

have some responsibility but whether they did or not, I
think that the most they could have gotten under this statute
as interpreted by the Alabama Supreme Court would be if
they could have gotten the trial judge to have looked at
this thing' under the Jenkins precedent to see -QUESTION:
that.

Well, now, what — I don't understand

You seem to say that the obscenity issue was in

this proceeding.

It may not have been to the jury or it

may have been to the judge.

You seem to think that the

defendant really did have some right under this statute.

34
even though he was only charged with selling something
that had already been declared to be obscene, some right to
raise the obscenity issue and have it adjudicated, to some
extent, anyway»
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:
doesn't

3eem

Let me say this, sir —

That certainly — that certainly

to be what the statute is talking about.

MR. MARSTON:

Well, let me say this.

This —

I believe, under this statute, that if you had a material
such as the motion picture "Carnal Knowledge" which was
involved in Jenkins, if you had a material where there was
really a serious question as to the validity of this other
determination of obscenity that you could relitigate it.
Now, I don't necessarily mean only in
QUESTION:

And you are urging us to accept that

as a construction of the Alabama statute?
MR. MARSTON:

No, sir, not necessarily but I

do believe —
QUESTION:

Well, are you or aren't you?

I mean,

we ought to judge the case on one basis or the other.
MR. MAR3TQN:

I believe under this statute ha

could have reopened it in another — his own civil pro­
ceeding.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting then that if it

had been "Carnal Knowledge" that had been involved in this

35
civil proceeding and in Mobile and it had there been held
that "Carnal Knowledge” was obscene and then "Carnal
Knowledge'5 was shown in Birmingham, that in that, instance
the defendant would not foe foreclosed from challenging
the obscenity of "Carnal Knowledge"?
MR. MARSTON:

Let me say this, sir»

I am thinking ahead of myself.

Maybe on --

In our brief we simply say,

and this is our position, that under the decision of the
Alabama Supreme Court, the question of obscenity, it is
not clear that the question of obscenity is closed forever
and for all time.
Now, how he could raise it is just not
presented by this case because Mr. McKinney didn't attempt
it.

Whether or not he could have brought another civil

proceeding under the '69 Act, which creates a right, to
declaratory judgment, once you receive this notice — and
you know, he received the notice under the '69 Act

and

he, that permits a suit for declaratory judgment to
determine whether the material is obscene.
Now, whether or not he could do that,- I don't
we say that the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court is
not clear on this.
It is clear that Mr» Justice Faulkner in his
opinion talks about "shifts in standards of obscenity."
He says "The standards of obscenity not having changed from

36
the time of the trial until the time of the sale" and so
on.

How, this implies that the question is not closed once

and for all.
QUESTION:

Would you answer my question directly?

ME. MARSTON:
question?

Yes, sir.

Exactly what was your

I thought I was answering it,
QUESTION:

If "Carnal Knowledge” had been declared

obscene in Mobile and then this prosecution was brought
against an exhibitor of "Carnal Knowledge" in Birmingham,
would or would not the exhibitor have a defense that
"Carnal Knowledge” is not obscene?
MR. MARSTON:

Is simply not obscene.

My answer is, either he would have the right to
do that or to file a declaratory judgment.

Now, in this

case —

So that in any criminal proceeding,

your answer is yes, he could have raised the issue of the
obscenity of "Carnal Knowledge."

QUESTION;

But let me ~ but my question is,

QUESTION;

How do you have a contempt by "over­

Isn’t that -MR. MARSTON:

Disregard o£ a judicial order,

having knowledge of it.
QUESTION;

Well, but, it was a judicial order

over in Mobile, wasn't it?
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION;

And how is he —

MR. MARSTON:
in contempt.

Yes, sir.

He was not — could not be held

There is no question about that.

But this

crime, the way it is defined, involves disregard of a
judicial determination which is like contempt.
We are not saying that he was convicted of
contempt of court but we are saying that the gravamen

of

this offense was the disregard of a judicial order rather
than just selling obscenity and because of this, were this
question to come up in the civil trial, the argument could
be made that your crime was disregarding the judicial
order and therefore you could not raise it in the criminal
case.

But that doesn't mean you couldn't have brought

your own action.
QUESTION:

How could he disobey an order to

which he was not a party?
MR. MARSTON;

Well, it was an in rem proceeding.

38

The parties don't make any difference in an in rem pro­
ceeding .
QUESTION:

Well, he was prosecuted for selling

something.
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Is that an in rem proceeding?

MR. MARSTON:
proceedingt

Yes, sir.

No, sir, that is a criminal

But ha was prosecuted for selling something

the status of which had been determined in a judicial
proceeding.
QUESTION:

How did he disobey the order?

MR. MARSTON:

Well, he wouldn't be disobeying

the order.
QUESTION:

Are you saying he is not a party?

MR. MARSTON:

He would be selling something

that had been judicially determined to be obscene.
QUESTION:

What bothers me, Mr. Marston, about

this particular case is that the complaint, which I gather
is equivalent in your practice to an information or an
indictment —■
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The complaint seems to telescope

two alternative provisions of the criminal statute.

If

you look on page 5 of Petition for Writ of Certiorari,
which is the Court's opinion, it starts with the statement,

39

"The Petitioner was charged by complaint that he did sell
obscene printed or written material;” then* that "said
material had been judicially found to be obscene»"
Whereas, the statute, if you look on page 5 of
the Brief for the Petitioner, makes it a criminal offense
to sell obscene material or to sell material that has just
judicially been determined to be obscene.
And it seems to me in this particular case, the
prosecution, by alleging that he sold obscene material as
a matter of fact puts the obscenity of that material very
much in issue.
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Petition for Writ

I —-

Well, why not?

MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Well, sir, I don't believe so.

Well —

will you look at page 5 of the

of Certiorari?

MR. MARSTON:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: "The Petitioner was charged by complaint
that he: —"
Now, read the first four lines of that, '■ that
he did sell obscene printed or x^ritten material;"
Do you see that?
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, that has nothing to do with any

charge that he sold anything that had been judicially

40
determined to be obscene.
MR. MARSTON s

Yes, sir.

Well, the words —

excuse me.
QUESTION:

It is simply is a claim that he sold

obscene printed or written material which puts in issue
the question of whether or not the printed or written
material is obscene.

Does it not?

MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I don't think so.

Well, why not?

MR. MARSTON:

Because that word "obscene" there —

now, the complaint could be construed that way but that
isn't how the Alabama Supreme Court construed and it and I
don't believe that is the way it has been construed all
along.

He —
QUESTION:

Whereas, the statute makes it an

offense to sell obscene material and also makes it an
offense to sell material that has judicially been determined
to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene, if you look
at Section 374 (4) 1. on page 5 of the Brief of the
Petitioner.
Here the complaint telescoped two alternative
sections of the criminal statute and therefore made it
incumbent upon the prosecution to show both that the
material was obscene and also that the material was known
to him to have been judicially declared to be obscene.
Do you see my point?

41
MR. MARSTON:

Yes, sir, I think so.

Because

they say "obscene printed material that has been judicially
determined to be obscene."

I believe that the word

"obscene" when it says "obscene printed material" or what­
ever, is simply describing the thing.
QUESTION:

Well, that is quite different from

what the statute says, which makes it an offense to sell
Sny mailable material known by such parson to have been
judicially found to be obscene under this chapter."

Quite

different.
MR. MARSTON:
distinction.
question.

Mr. Justice, I do not see the

I can’t — I simply can't answer your

I think that the statement, "obscene material"

is simply describing the thing and than, why is it obscene?
Because it has been judicially determined to be obscene.
QUESTION:

Well, the Trial Court, in any event,

said that the charge -— or the offense that has been
charged doesn't include the issue of obscenity.
MR. MARSTON:

Yes, that's right, that was

charged —
QUESTION:

That was in the lower court ruling,

wasn't it?
MR. MARSTON:

'Ehafc was charged to the jury, yes,

sir, without objection by the Plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but in. the colloquy before

42
that , the judge raade that ruling, didn't he?
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:
you?

Yes.

Mr. Marson, may I put this case to

Assume that the Court in Mobile, instead of having

this particular matter being before it, had had the art
catalogue of the state museum and had found it to be
obscene.

Would that sustain a prosecution under this

section of the Alabama statute?
MR. MARSTON:

Yes.

Well, sir, of course, this

is why I say that in spite of this, that the Petitioner’s
interpretation of the Alabama Supreme Court decision to
the effect that the question of obscenity is closed without
regard to anything else is simply not so.
Obviously, in this case, he couldn't — there
must be a way that an individual who is not a part to that
suit can obtain relief from it and Alabama law provides
two possibilities.
One would be — and this one I am certain of —
his own declaratory judgment action and possibly — and 1
think probably, in that sort of a case where the thing is
obviously not obscene, he could raise it in his criminal
trial, under this statute.
QUESTION:

But a declaratory judgment won't do

him much good if he is already in jail as a result of a
criminal prosecution.

43

MR. MARSTON:

Well, as soon as he found out

about it, he could file that criminal prosecution.
Mr.. McKinney, in this case, when he got that
notice, he could have sought declaratory judgment at that
point.
QUESTION:

Could he have used that declaratory

judgment in the criminal case?

I thought you said you

couldn't use a civil case in a criminal case.
MR'. MARS TON:

Well, he couldn't — after he got

arrested, he couldn't have ~ I guess he could have still
filed a declaratory judgment action then.
QUESTION:

Well, could he have used it in a

criminal case?
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

He'd still go to jail, but he %*culd

have a declaratory judgment.
MR. MARSTON:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

To keep him warm.

QUESTION:

Who would have the burden of proof

in that declaratory judgment?
MR. MARSTON:

The 1aw of Alabama is very clear

that the would-be censor has the burden of proof and that
case came up in a case cited, I believe, by both parties
I know by us, Visual Educators v. Koeppell which happened
to involve a suit by a theatre, an expresser, against a

44
city that didn't want to license them and the Alabama
Supreme Court ruled in no uncertain terms, of course, they
say, the burden is on the would-be censor in that case,
in spite of the fact that it was the expresser that brought
the suit.
QUESTION:

I take it, then, you think that if

a publication is declared obscene in Mobile in a civil
proceeding brought by the state against Mr* A and then the
state attorney general takes a copy of that declaration
and injunction and mails it to all the bookstores in the
state and the law says that anybody who sells in the face of
that declaration is guilty of contempt, everybody else
with notice is bound by that injunction? that any book­
seller selling the book could automatically be found in
contempt without any hearing other than going to the sale.
If he sold it, he is guilty of contempt.
MR. MARS TON:
QUESTION:
tution.

Now — under this statute?

Well, I would say under the Consti­

If the state —
MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

of a provision.

Passed a statute like that.

If the state provided •— had that sort

I would think a fortiorari you would say

that would be constitutional.
MR. MARSTON:

I think rather obviously, if you

are talking about contempt, now.

45
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MARSTON:

If you sent notice around to them#

joining them as parties or giving them an opportunity to
come

in as parties, they would be bound but you are

talking there about straight contempt.
QUESTION:

You don’t think so?

MR. MARSTON:
QUESTION:

No, I don't —

No, sir, I don't think so.

[Simultaneous —- not transcribable.1

MR. MARSTON:

Thank you so much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith, do you

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.
MR. SMITH:

If it please the Court, just a few

observations.
Number one, Counsel said that it is clear under
Alabama law that the burden of proof is on the censor in
the civil declaratory judgment cases.

That was in 1972

that that decision was rendered so in 1970 that question
was not as open and shut as it Was in 1972 in the Koeppell
case.
We also point out, if the Court please, that
taking page A5 of my Appendix, which is the —• part of the
majority opinion, Justice Faulkner, the first sentence in
the first paragraph says, "Neither McKinney nor the state
introduced evidence in the trial on the question of

46
obscenity vel non,

McKinney raised that issue in a motion

to quash the complaint which the trial judge overruled,"
and then, continuing to page A7, Justice Faulkner says,
"We now decide the question of whether the Mobile Circuit
Court decree is binding on McKinney, since he was not a
party to the action and since obscenity vel non was not
permitted as an issue by the Trial Court."
And even Justice Heflin says on page A9, "Thus
there was no finding by the jury that the matter alleged
to be obscene was obscene and, indeed, no such determination
could have been made under the Trial Court's charge."
QUESTION:
SMITH:

Where are you on A9?
A9, the first full paragraph, your

Honor, the last sentence.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

I see it.

Thank you.

So the last thing I would like to

point out to the Court is that the -- with Justice Brennan's
question, regarding "Carnal Knowledge."
If "Carnal Knowledge" was found obscene the day
before the decision of this Court in Jenkins in Mobile,
Alabama and notice were given in Birmingham, Alabama to
Mr. McKinney if he were a theatre exhibitor, he could still
be held accountable for having violated the crime of having
displayed or exhibited material which had previously or
judicially been declared obscene, even though this Court's ~~

47
QUESTION:
before?

Well, why do

you put it the day

What about two months afterwards?
MR. SMITH:

Well, then I would think these are

not the sensitive tools because this Court, in a rarely
unanimous opinion -- at least in the area of obscenity —
ruled, I thought, that "Carnal Knowledge" was not obscene.
QUESTION:

Do you know what the community was

in the civil proceeding of Mobile?
MR. SMITH:

Did you tell us that?

I said that at the time, your

Honors, the only decision of the Court —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

No, what was?
I don't know.

What was?
And I say, the only

decision of a court in Alabama was the Court of Criminal
Appeals and at that time, the parameters were the community
from which the jury was drawn ?md that is the City of
Birmingham versus Jones and that is 45 Alabama Appeals 86.
QUESTION:

Well, presumably that was the

community involved in the Mobile proceedings.
MR. SMITH:

And the first time the Court said,

it is the state standard is in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, except the Mobile proceedings,

would that involve a jury?
MR. SMITH:

That was not a jury but we are saying,

the area from which the veniremen were drawn,
That’s all.

48
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

was submitted.]
