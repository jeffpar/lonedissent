HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1808, Laing against the United States, and 74-75,
United States against Hall; consolidated cases.
Mr. Smith, I think the Clerk; has indicated to you
that since the case has been argued before, we hope that
counsel will b® al>le to present the consolidated cases in less
than the total of two hours.
MR. SMITH:

I think that will be quite possible.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
CM BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL.
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courti
These two consolidated cases come here on writs of
certiorari from the United States Courts of Appeals for the
Second and Sixth Circuits.

The Circuits have split on the

question whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is
required to issue a notice of deficiency in connection with his
termination of a taxpayer’s taxable year pursuant to his
statutory authority under section 6851 of the Code.
The practical significance of this procedural question
focuses on the Anti-Injunction Act, which the Court has had
rac-ant opportunity to explore, Section 7421(a) of the Code,
which is set forth in our brief at page 65 in the Appendix.

4
That provisions generally provides that no suit, for
tli® purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any
tax shall be maintained in any court by any person.

And if the

Commissioner of Internal Revenue is not required to issue a
notice of deficiency in these cases, which we submit is tha
case, then these suits are barred by that Act.
Row- the taxpayers in these cases, and the courts ‘that
have held acrainst our position, have focused on the prefatory

e

exception phrase of the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides

•

“except as provided in section 6212(a) and (c) , 6213(a).”
Ncm? that prefatory

exception deals with cases which

are adjudicable by the Tax Court»

So, when stripped of all the

statutory language, these cases really present the question
whether an assessment of taxes which are deemed to be immediate­
ly due and payable; under section 6851(a) are ad judicable by the
Tax Court.
Nov?, we submit that the terms of fee statute and the
historical evidence clearly indicates that Congress decided not
♦

to give tha Tax Court jurisdiction in these cases.

That is,

chat when iho Commissioner terminates someone8s taxable year
in the middle of that year and then makes an. assessment pursuant
to section 5201(a) of the taxes immediately due and payable,
that that administrative action is not immediately reviewable
In the Tax Court, but that the taxpayer must seek other remedies
specially the refund suit route in the District Court.

QUESTIONz

Ara I right now# that the Congress, or at

least the House Ways and Means Committee# is contemplating
changing this whole thing?
MR. SMITH?

There is **■-> there are a variety of

legislative proper, ais currently being considered —
QUESTIONS

But isn’t there one in the House Ways and

Means Committee?
MRo SMITH:

There is

there was testimony held this

summer before the-?. Senate — before the ~~ before a subcommittee
of the Ways and Means Committee# I understand.

But I am not

prepared to speak about the details of those proposals# and
I think that it's entirely speculative at this juncture whether
there will be any litigation.
QUESTIONS
MR. SMITHs

Yes,
nevertheless,, the conflict continues to

exist.
The facts of the
QUESTIONs

Incidentally# while we have you interrupted ,

there is pending here another tax case# United States against
Shapiro# and somewhere in your argument will you relate that,
on© to these cases# if there is any relationship?
MR. SMITH;

I can do it

right now# Mr. Justice

Blackmun,
The issue in the Shapiro case — Shapiro involved a
jeopardy assessment under section 6861(a), which is the **~

6
which 'x'3 contend in this case is an entirely distinct statutory
provision, which should, not b@ merged into the termination
prevision»
The question in Shapiro is a burden of proof question»
Our position in that case is that the Court of Appeals has
improperly imposed upon the government the burden of proving
the validity of its assessment in & straight injunctive action»
In other words, what happened to the taxpayer in
Shapiro was simply that he was subjected to a early assessment
under section 6863.(a), not a termination.

And he sued to

enjoin that assessment and was of course bound by the Court*s
judically create*; exception in the Williams vs.

Enochs vs.

Williams Packing oase,
And th® Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit held that, in those circumstances the Commissioner was
obliged to corns forward with some sort, of evidence demonstrating
the validity of his assessment.,
And we think our position in that case is that the
burden of proof rests on th® taxpayer to demonstrate that, No.
1, he is entitled to equitable relief because no adequate
remedy of law is available? and, No» 2, that under no circum­
stances can th® government prevail on the merits of its claim»
So, to the extent that both cases involve the AntiInjunction Act, they are related, but they involve these
disparate provisions of the Code, the termination provision and

7
the early assessment provision»
I think that the facts can be briefly stated, and
they are basically undisputed, *»«*
QUESTION,*

But you feel they are disparate provisions?

MR* SMITH:

Yea*

Yes, we dod.

And, in fact, it is

our submission thet the confusion that has arisen in the area
has been

has arisen out of an incorrect interpretation of

the statutory history, that these statutes both came; in
separately, were designed to do quite separate things, and that
the terms of cm® should not be judicially incorporated into the
other*
Before I get into that, into the legal questions, I
think it probably would Im worthwhile to review briefly the
facts in both of these cases.
In the Laing; case from -the Second Circuit, the tax­
payer is a citizen of New Zealand. In May 1972 he entered the.
United 'States from Canada on a visitor's visa. On the evening
[sic]-.
of July 24, 1972, in fact in the early morning hours, he and
two other people, in a rented automobile, attempted to re-enter
Canada.

The Canadian officials were dissatisfied with the

identification proffered by one of the passengers in the vehicle,
And they refused entry to the trio, into Canada.
They than had to turn around and go back to the United
States.

This was the crossing at Derby, Vermont,
Upon attempted re-entry back into the United States,

8
they were subjected to a search of their vehicle by the United
Statas Customs, and the search revealed that a suitcase under
the — in the engine compartment of the car, contained approxi­
mately §300,000 in United States currency®
Search of the persons revealed ‘chat the petitioner
in this case, Lairg, had a quantity of hashish on his possession.
The customs officials thereupon, as is the procedure,
notified the District

Director of Internal Revenue for -the

District of Vermont, because of the unusual happenstance,
it* s a highly unusual circumstance ‘that people are traveling
with so much cash concealed in the engine compartment of their
car»

And the Internal Revenue Service exorcised its

statutory power under section 6851, the termination provision,
and terminated tho taxable years of all three passengers as
of that date, June 24, 1972»
How, ultimately, assessments of approximately
$195,000 were imposed against each of the three persons»

These

assessment®, as I mentioned last time, were computed on -the
well-established net. worth plus non-»deductible expenditures
method»
The people were questioned as to how long — the
petitioner, Laing, was questioned as to how long he had been
in the United States»

It turned out to be 25 or 30 days»

The amount of money was part of his net worth, a sum was
computed also for his non-deductible living expenses„ and then

9
the tax computation easily follows from that,
NOW, ““
QUESTIONS

I suppose he never before had been a tax**

payer in the United states, had he?
MRo SMlTHs

I suppose that is correct, although the

record is silent on that*
QUESTIONj

As far as tK'e record shows, in his whole

life ha!s been in our country only 25 days; is -that right?

MR® SMITH? Could well have been, and I think in a
situation ~~ this is exactly the kind of situation that the
statute is designed to protect the revenue®

leave the country with large amounts of property*

I mean,

mean, it stems to use that the statute fits -these facts like a
glove

QUESTIONs

Mr» Smith, let me be sure, was your net

worth computation based on 25 days expanded to the full year,
or was this regarded in Mr, Laing*s case as the entire income,
in quotations, for the year? do you know?
MR. SMITHs

Well, the record is silent on this, but

my understanding is that a sum of mousy was allocated for living
expanses for each day, and that was added on to the amount of
his net worth0

In other words, you know, in a normal computa­

tion you have an opening net worth and a closing net worth.
The opening net worth, I suppos©, had to b© deemed t© be zero.
QUESTION?

How on earth could they do that except by

just arbitrary fiat?
MR. SMITH? Well, I mean, when people are, you know,
essentially it’s not —

QUESTION?

Well, —
Or how could they assume it, except —

MR. SMITH? Well, I think that it’s a. warranted
assumption under the

you know, essentially our system works

under the ground rules that the taxpayer has the burden of

MR, SMITH3

Right, and I think those ground rules —

— applied to United States taxpayers.

nonresident alien taxpayer, they are even more applicable,

But he has a chance to explore all these

MRe SMITHg

Oh, absolutely«

Absolutely*

But the

point is that unifies the Commissioner takes this action, the
money is gone, and the statute is designed to provide the
Treasury with the mechanism of insuring that money doesn’t
slip through the fingers of the Treasury, because tax returns
are normally due on the following April 15th or, in the case
when you live abroad, on June 15, and if they just examined
this situation and said, "Well, thank you very much? please
file your tax return next June, and explain this happenstance
to us,*5' the strong likelihood is that they would never hear
from him again-,
So I think that it’s not an entirely unreasonable
response to an extraordinary set of facts0
QUESTIONS

In -any event, the basic validity of the

termination provisions are not in issue in this case»

MRo SMITH;

The basic validity of the termination

provisions are net at issue, nor is the Commission's applica»*

You mean they're not at issue in Laing?

13
MR® SMITH?

They’re not at issue in Laing, and I

don’t view them at. issue in Hall, either.

It seems to us that these cases came up on the narrow
question as to whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has to issue a notice of d@fici.ency in these cases, and that
if h® does
QUESTION: Well, I thought there was soaa® question if
he wasn't, that there might be some constitutional issue.
MR. SMITH:

oh, there is a constitutional issue in

QUESTION: Well, you shouldn't say, then, ‘that they
aren't subject to question in these cases.
MR. SMITH: Well, they are subject to question only
if —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITHs

Well, only on a constitutional basis.
*““ only if the courts which have held

against us are correct in their assumption that that Tax Court
remedy is the sol© remedy in this circumstances„

W® think that

that is based on a misreading of the Court's Flora opinion,
and that there is a remedy in the — inadequate remedy in the
District Court.

So we think the constitutional issue vanishes

once that's considered in some detail.
How, th© District Court dismissed this suit on the
basis of the Anti-Injunction Act, and the Second Circuit affirmed
on the basis of its decision in the Irving case.

14
The whole facts are relatively parallel»

The

Commissioner of Internal Revenue received information that Mrs»
Hall was engaged in narcotics trafficking and h® terminated
her taxable year as of January 31, 1973»
The assessment in that case also proceeded on a pro­
jection of volume of activity, and it came out to be something
like $52,000»
Now, thi:5 taxpayer Hall also refused to pay the tax,
but, contrary to what happened in the District Court in
Vermont, in the Second Circuit, the District Court granted a
preliminary injunction, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the
authority of its decision in Ramtao, which is still awaiting
disposition by tha.i Court on our petition,
Now, wa think that it is worthwhile to consider how
these statutes cc: ■& into play,

I mean, if you look at page

60 and 61 of our brief, you see, as l mentioned, that the
— *X£ the Secretary or his delegate finds that a taxpayer
either designs quickly to depart from the United States or
intends to conceal himself or his property," he can terminate
someone’s taxable year.
New, that termination by itself, that administrative
action does not affect any collection activity.

All that we

have is an artificial termination of the taxable year, and a
declaration that the taxes are immediately due and payable.
Without more, "the Commissioner could not. collect these taxes»

15
But there is an assessment provision of the Code, which we set
forth at page 53 of our brief# section 6201(a).

And that

provisions empowers the Secretary to make inquiries# determina­
tions , and assessments of all taxes.
So it- is a combination of the termination power and
the assessment power, which is a very old statute, which? in
its present form, dates from 1872, but actually is much older
than that, because it basically is the essential assessment
power for the collection of taxes, which has been going on
sine® the beginning of the Republic, when the Secretary of the
Treasury was Alexander Hamilton, and the taxes were excise'and
molasses and whiskey taxes.
So there's no doubt that this power exists, and that
it is independent of any other provision of the Code.
Now, one® the Commissioner makes -«*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL. - Resumed
MR. SMITHs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
When th® Court adjourned, I was discussing the
operation of the various statutory provisions that come into
play upon a termination, and they are essentially the termina­
tion out of section 6851, and then th® assessment that follows
this clerical notation by th® Commissioner, which has the
effect of a judgment upon which the taxes can then be collected
by involuntary means, which were done in these cases because
the taxpayers both refused to pay the amount deemed to be
immediately due and payable.
QUESTION: What authority did you have to seise the

money?
MR. SMITH: The authority to seise the money comes

from section 6331, which is set forth at page S? of our brief,
which is entitled, “Levy and Distraint"*

MR. SMITHs

I understand that.
—“ but the Commissioner has determined

that if he waits to collect them, then they are not going to

that's a big difference»
Because, in the first situation, the taxpayer’s own
actions have contributed to tee necessity of the Commissioner
taking tee extraordinary action of terminating his taxable
year and determining his taxes due and payable.

In the other

situation, while it could be the taxpayer's own actions, there
are a variety of other situations which can contribute to art
early assessment under section «—

QUESTIONz

That's not very artificial®

MR® SMITH: Well, by artificial, I mean. simply it's
not by operation of the calendar„
Now, 1 think that one© the distinction between the
two situations is mad® clear, because in the early assessment
provision it could simply mean that-, the taxpayer is going
bankrupt, or he’s a parson who fritters away bis ■ assets for
one reason or another, and the taxpayer in such a situation,
if the Commissioner is going to take the normal rout® of
allowing the Tax Court proceeding to stay collection until
that’s finished, then it’s quit® possible that, whatever
decision the Court reaches to what tax is owing, there’s not
going to be- any ability to collect on the deficiency*
how, that’s really why, it seems to us, that once
that is really understood, that’s why the Tax Court has
jurisdiction in the early assessment provision and not in the
termination provision, because if you look at page 71 of our
brief, which sets forth the Revenue Act of 1921, the proviso
on page 71 of our brief, which reads, "Provided, That in
cases where the Commissioner believes that the collection of
the amount due will be jeopardised by such delay he may males
the assessment without giving such notice or awaiting the
conclusion of such hearing®”
That proviso came in as an exception to an administra­
tive appeal procedure, which was enacted in 1921, under which

24
a taxpayer could seek an administrative review and co.liecti.on
would not occur during that. time.
Now, in order to provide for the situation where the
taxpayer*s assets might not he available after the administra­
tive review was complete, Congress enacted that proviso»
Now, that proviso is the direct statutory antecedent
of section 6861, the jeopardy assessment provision»

MRo SMITHs

Can you?

Yes, that’s true, we cannot sell»

the reason **«
QUESTION?

And now you*re claiming you could not

only seise, but sell under 6851?
MR» SMITHs

Exactly»

Congress has made that choice,

because the no sal© restrictions didn’t come in until the
1954 Codec
£ think 'the important point is that the termination
provision operated

stood in the statutes independently of

the early assessment provision, for three years, from 1918 to
1921»

And under those circumstances, a taxpayer could be

terminated, his taxable year could be terminated, the

25
Cosmissioner could sell ~~ seise his assets if he didn't
voluntarily payt and, in fact? he wouldn’t have any remedy tc
go to the Tax Court, because the Tax Court didn’t even exist
at that time.

His only remedy would be a refund suit»

QUESTIONi

Your statutory argument.rests in large

part on that three'”year interval, doesn't it?
MR» SMITH s
QUESTIONs

It rests on «Without it,, you would have a' much harder

case»
MR. SMITHS Well, it rests in part on that threeyear interval, Mr. Justice Blackmun; but I don’t think that’s
the only thing it rests on.

I think that another important

thing, which I think deserves emphasis, is the fact that when
the Board of Tax Appeals was created in the Revenue Act of
1924, the Board was authorized to hear specifically enumerated
cases, and those enumerated cases are set forth in our brief
at page 32.
They involve Section 274, that is the ordinary kind
of deficiency case? 279, relating to claims for abatement of
deficiencies assessed under Section 274(d).
this early assessment provision.

.And 274(d)

is

And then there are soma others.

I think the important idling is that when Congress
set up the Board of Tax Appeals, which is the predecessor of
the Tax Court, it enumerated a class of cases and notably
absent from this list was termination cases under what was then

26

Section 146 of the Cod©, or the Revenue Act? and is now the
termination provision in the Revenue Act of 1954 — Revenue
Code of 19540
Now, it seems to us that Congress has made a conscior/;
choice, and 1 think that the courts that have gone astray on
this question have taken the creation of the Board of Tax
Appeals in the loosest possible, and derived from it a lessen
which wo don’t think is properly learned from it»

Congress

created this Court, it's a creature of statute, it's designed
to hear certain eases»
excise fcax cases»

For example, it’s not designed to hear

And under section 6862 of the Cod®, w@

can terminat® a taxpayer’s taxable year in an excise tax case,
and there's no notice of deficiency, there's no Tax Court
review? I think that's absolutely plain»
We think that this case represents the same kind of
congressional decision„
New, it seems to us that the positione of the courts
that have projected the Commissioner's assertion that no
notice of deficiency is required rests on two notions,
essentially®

one, that the assessment power in a termination

case derives from section 6861, and therefor© the statutes
has to be merged, because they operate in tandem»

We don't

think that’s right»
In fact, the three-year gap really proves that it's
net right»

Because for three years the Commissioner of Internal

Revenue could assess taxes pursuant to a termination, and there
was no section 6861 to provide him with any assessment author­

I don't think that there's *»“ I don't

I think the

quarrel in this case arises out of where that assessment
authority comes from, you know, in connection with the
termination ©f a taxable year,
Now, we say it comes from the basic assessment
authority, which says the Commissioner shall be empowered to
assess all taxes.

And ones you realize

that,

-that it doesn't

Now, I think ‘that tins other propr of 'those cases is

The reason it's without merit essentially is because

Internal Revenue is an administrative matter, is entitled to
a reasonable amount of time to appraise the validity of a claim
before the taxpayer seeks judicial redress.

MR, SMITHs Wall, I think it's hard to — it*s hard

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE' BURGER* Very well.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DONALD M. HEAVRXN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF ELIZABETH JANE HALL
MR. HEAVRXN*

Mr, Chief Jus tics, and may it pleat?©

the Courts
X*d like to comment briefly on something Mr, Jus tics
Brennan sale! earlier.

H@ mentioned that the House Ways and

Means Committee is considering legislation to alter the
jeopardy assessment procedure.

And this summer I had the

pleasure of testifying as a witness before that Committee, but
I hop© that the fact that there is a move afoot in Congress
to alter the jeopardy assessment provisions of the Coda does
not stop this Court from taking proper action in this case.
The reason 1 say that is that sometimes Congress
takes a long time to do what should be done right away.
In starting the argument# specifically in reference
to Elizabeth Jane Hell# 18d like to start with a comment mad®
by Mr. Smith.

He said that there has been a great deal of

confusion concerning thee© Cod© issues and what's before the
Court and the various courts, and he indicates that the courts
are confused because of various interpretations of these Cod®
sections that are at stake.
Well, X would respectfully submit that a lot of the
confusion that has occurred in these tax cases has been brought
about by the activities of the Internal Revenue Service.

36
The government, each tins© I think that I understand
its argument and what is at stake and what is in issue, 'they
seam to wiggle away a little bit and change it slightly*
Today I heard, for the first time, in Mr, Smith’s oral argument:
that the tax that was assessed against Mrs* Hall was based on -s,
proposed amount of illegal controlled substances that she had
sold during this 31«day period*
In the first argument in January, he said that the
amount was based on information given by confidential informant,
and when the government argued this case at the Sixth Circuit
they stated they had no idea how this $52,000 figure was reached *
Also, in the genesis of this case, if we go back, and
on page 13 of the Appendix in this case, -this la from the
Sixth Circuit, this is actually a Xerox copy of the government,
document, but if we look at page 13 of the Appendix, we see
that the government sends out a tax bill to Mrs* Hall, and
on the tax bill — I’ll read this to the Court — it says,
"This is a notice of tax due on your return identified above*"
Then we look above and we sea -that this is a 1040
return, according to the government.

Well, such is not the

case
When we first entered this case, the government was
alleging that there was a $52,000 deficit on Mrs., Hall’s tax
return, when nc return had been filed at all*

So we filed &

complaint and said that if any return had been filed in Mrs*

37
Hall’s name, it was a fraudulent tax return, because Mrs-,
Hall did not file any tax return for that short period of time,
Then whan we get to ths legal issues , we see that.
QUESTIONs

Well, isn’t, that notice just a form to

advise ■»■*»
MR* HEAVRINs

Well, yas , but I have to assume that

the government is intelligent enough to select the correct
form, Mr* Justice Blackmun*

I can’t

as counsel for Mrs*

Hall, 1 can't be responsible for the government taking out
the wrong document and alleging that she's filed a tax return*
I have to refute that —QUESTION*

1 guess I don't get your point*

What are

you leading to?
MR* HEAVRIN*
QUESTIONs

Okay,

I'm saying —

I've known many instances where wrong

forms were employed, without any prejudice to anybody*
MR. HEAVRIN* All right*
necessarily that there’s prejudice.

Well, I'm not saying
I’m saying that a lot of

the confusion 'that Mr. Smith refers to has been caused by
tli® government* And when w© get to ‘the actual legal decisions
in this areas -** for example, in the Sell ruck case — th©
government has had an enormous difficulty overcoming the idea
of the assessment authorities*
As Mr* Justice Whit© said, where does the authority
com© from?

38

Well, Mr. Smith in his argument, h© says, well, it
originates in 6201.

But originally the government argued

in the Schreck case that 6851, in and of itself, contained the
implicit power to assess.
QUESTION:

It isn’t required, there is plenty of law

to this effect, that the government doesn’t have to be consis­
tent in tax cases, and they certainly haven't been over the
years.
Again, I ask, what the point is.
MR. HEAVRXNs All right. And this is no exception.
Well, the point is that every time you nail them dew.
and you say,"Is this what you're arguing, and you're wrong on
this issue*, they slip away «aid argue a little bit differently.
How, before this Court —
QUESTIONS Well, in practice we haw all been
subjected to that frustration, but it isn't -MR. HEAVRINs
QUESTIONt

Yes, that's true.

Why don't you just say what you mean.

MR. HEAVRINs

Okay.
*

How, I was getting into the meat of the case.

In

this particular case, the government has argued that the
assessment authority originates in 6201, and this is a general
provision, of assessment authority granted by Congress.

But

if we examine 6201, as I stated in the brief, this particular
section refers to taxes that are payable by stamp, such ass

39
liquor taxes; gambling taxes, and so forth»
Taxes that relate to income arid jeopardy situations
in income tax situations are found in 685.1 and 6861 or a
combination of both»
How, on the issue of deficiency, which the Court
questioned Mr» Smith about, the government, in' the cases where
they have prevailed «*•» for example.

in the Irving case — thoy

war® able fee convince the Court that what was .assessed against
the taxpayer really wasn't, a tax at all, and if we take a
look in the government’s brief «>*» and I don’t recall the exact
page, but I believe it’s about page 26 of the government'- a
brief ~~ they say, We are not really assessing a .tax, we5r©
assessing a provisional amount that has to foe paid, sort of an
insurance policy that assures that the money will be there
when and if the tax liability is established,
Mow, at this point, the government is telling this
Court and the Second Circuit and all the other courts that
there really i© no tax»

Then when we raise the objection of

Flora, where he says that we haven’t paid the tax, we can’t
pay the tax because Mrs» Hall doesn’t have the money —* when
we raise the Flora objection and say the full payment rule
prevents us from filing suit, they answer by saying, Mo, it
doesn't, because this really isn’t a tax, and no deficiency is
created»
Well, I think that that statement is incorrect»

I

40
think the only thing th® government can collect against th©
citizen-, the IKS at least» is a tax, and I cannot accept the
provisional amount theory»
Now, if: we accept th® provisional amount theory,
today Mr. Smith Is in Court and he is rigorously asserting thc\
Injunction Act prohibits this type of suit» end he
recited it to the Court,
But if we read the Anti** In junction Act, it says that
no action to restrain th® collection of taxos shall be mad®,
so if w® adopt Mr, Smith’s theory that this really isn’t a
tax» I would respectfully submit that the Anti-Injunction Act
has no application, and they can be enjoined from what they
are doing,
I do~*t believe we hav® to go that fax, because I
believe it’s in 6961» the jeopardy assessment»

I believe that '

is the correct Coda section»
But if we accept, his argument on th® provisional
theory idea» then this really isn’t a tax, and the Anti-Injunc­
tion Act does not apply.
This puts the government» in my • opinion, in the
interesting position where if .they are trying to stop you from
suing them» they say it*s a tax? but if they’re trying to keep
you out of Tax Court, and kaap you from litigating your claim
without full payment» they say it is only a provisional amount.
How, th® ca-s®, when it r a ached my desk, I had th©

41
fealing, and X still do, that there was something seriously
wrong in a situation where the government could go out to a
lady’s house and say, "Here is a tax bill for $52,000? pay it»”
And Mr, Smith very cavalierly nays that we refused
to pay the bill»

Well, there wasn’t any way we could pay the

bill»

Because Mrs» Hall simply didn’t have $52,000» The
bill
$52,;000/was approximately ten times her entire worth.
The provisions under the Coda, “full payment or post

bond for the total amount" and "full payment and file a refund
suit” left Mrs. Hall literally without a remedy»
And the further X get into the case, the more injust
it seems»

Every citizen, I think, has a fear of the Internal

Revenue Service? more so than th® FBI or the CIA or any of
these other organizations»
And it may be veiled fear and a remote fear at most,
times, but in the instant case the fear of IRS was not only
real but it was realized by Mrs» Hall.
Now, the government is not the type of organisatior
that ever admits that it was in error.

Whether it’s -- no

matter what they’re doing, they always justify their actions
by saying, "This is for -the common good" and “this is for some
lofty purpose"„
QUESTIONS Well, you don't suggest that some citizens
ought not. to have a fear of the IRS, do you?
of them shouldn’t

Certainly, some

42

MR. HEAVRIN: Well, X don’t think, Mr* Justice
Rehnquisfc, that citizens should fear their government.
QUESTIONS Wells how about a guy who’s been dodging
taxes for the last twenty years and the IRS —
MR. HEAVRINs

Well, I think the guy should be

prosecuted.
QUESTIONS

Well, shouldn’t he be ~~ wouldn’t ha very

likely be in fear of the IRS?
MR. HEAVRINs

I'm not talking specifically about the

man who’s been dodging taxes, I’m talking about the average
guy who goes to work at a factory every day, eight days a
week, he has more fear of IRS than he does any other
governmental agency„
QUESTION2 Well, I thought your statement —
QUESTIONS

Just a general statement.

MR. HEAVRINs

Yes, I think that it is a generalization.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Yes, why don’t you get

on with your argument.
MR. HEAVRINs

So 'the ■»- what I'm pointing out — I

did, I thought I had gotten onto it by saying that the fear
was realised in Mrs. Hall’s case.
on her doorstep.

The IRS actually showed up

The IRS actually made a demand of her for a

sum of money that far exceeded her total net worth, and, as
we have stated in the argument here in January and in the brief,
at that time Mrs. Hall was without a remedy.

43
Mrs. Hall then proceeded to the United States District
Court, where she filed a suit.
How, 6851 assessments, according to the government,
are tentative in nature.

And: this is admitted by the government

in its brief ~~ I can’t recall exactly where it is in the brief.
Exit they say these things are tentative in nature.
Yet, based on this tentative tax liability, the IRS
immediately drags off her automobile.

A few days later they

put it up for sale.
What could the government gain in such a situation?
In on® of these equity balancing situations, Mrs.
Hall was the one with everything to lose and in theory she
could have lost, actually lost her livelihood, because, not
being able to make the full payment, not being able to make
the $52,000 payment, the assessment against her would continue,
unless she could stop -the

Internal Revenue Service from

continuing the process of collection.
In the last argument I mentioned to the Court that
the example, if she goes to work on the following Monday
morning and she draws a paycheck at the and of the week, the
government can attach that paycheck and apply it to the
$52,000o

In a way she's in a vary much more difficult position

than Mr, Laing, because Mr. Laing actually had the money.
And in the Clifford Irving case, Clifford Irving actually had.
the money.

44

But what happens to the taxpayer who doesn't have
the money# and cannot stop the collection procedure?
They are trapped in a snowball that's rolling down
hill# ‘that, keeps getting bigger as it goes# and there's
nothing they can do about, it# unless they have the option of
going into the Unitad States District Court# as Mrs, Hall did#
filing a suit enjoining the Internal Revenue Service from the
collection of its taxes,
I think that I've pretty well explained our position.
If there are no questions# I'll quit,
I want to say that when I argued this case at the
Sixth Circuit# the lawyer who represented the government came
over to me and we had lunch and he said# "We've stopped this,
IRS is not" —
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Is this in 'the record now?

Or are you going out on a limb?
MR, HEAVRIN:

Ho# Mr, Chief Justice,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR, HEAVRINs

Then I suggest you abstain.

Okay,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Confine yourself to the

record,
MR, HEAVRIN:

Okay,

Well# I was going to close by

saying I hop© that this Court hands down a ruling that will
cause IRS to not be tempted to restart this procedure of
jeopardy assessments# where there really is no jeopardy.

And

45
tli® purpose of the assessment is punitive in nature.
Thank you.

a jeopardy framework, where do you cax*;ry $300,000 on a 500-mile
auto trip in the middle of the night?

That may be true, Your Honor.

But what

I'm saying, in effect, Judge, is I'm referring to the situation

And there are people, Your Honor,

who deal in nothing but cash, for their own idiosyncratic
reasons.

And I don't know what those *—
QUESTIONs

They are mostly honest people.

MR. OTERIs

Your Honor, I can’t say that they are

I know gamblers who deal in large amounts of money»

who pay their taxas every yaary and I don't

think this case

should be decided on the fact that the money was in a suitcase
in -til© motor block of an automobiIs.
QUESTIONS

But the jeopardy assessment structure

of the statute is aimed at1, precisely this kind of situation
among many others like it, is it not?
MR. OTERXs

No, Your Honor.

For on® reason, Judge,

and I say this only because one of the other Judges this
morning

• on® of the other Court members this rooming pointed

out something.

We are assuming on® thing.

Mr. Laing is a taxpayer.

We’re assuming that

You know, that's the assumption that

47
we seem to have neglected to fight in this case®

There’s no

evidence whatsoever, and that’s the constitutional problem I
face also, that Mr® Laing is a taxpayer in the United States,
Your Honor®

Any more evidence than there would be if, when

this Court was in Paris this summer, upon leaving you happened
to have a couple of thousand dollars in cash in your pocket,
you were searched arid that money seized®
QUESTION*

I thought the assumption of this case was

that he ought to b© a taxpayer®
MR® OTERIs

Well, no, Your Honor, what the government

has don® is the government has assumed that he is a taxpayer,
and taken his money and treated him this way®
On© of jay basic arguments, and in an effort to keep
within a time framework for this Court, I’m going to basically
stay away from 'the codal argument, Your Honor, and just
address myself, if I can, to the constitutional issues — one
of the basic arguments, Judge, is that -there is no evidence
whatsoever that he was- a taxpayer®
And when you read the case, Your Honor, when you
read the facts in this particular case, in the. Appendices,
you find that he gets stopped at the border at 2s00 a®m®, thau
there was a Mr® Fields, who is the District Director in
Vermont, was called by Customs at 2;00 a®m®

And it's right

in the Appendix, Your Honor, his deposition and testimony®
And he said to the Customs man, "How long can you

48
keep him?”

And the Customs man said, "Well, X can hold him

for two hours., but if you send somebody her®, I'll keep him
till they get here.”
At ten o'clock the next morning, Your Honor, eight
hours later, Mr* Laing is sitting in a room up at Derby Lin®,
Vermont, being held, waiting for IRS people*

At ten o'clock

in the morning, two IRS people show up, and they talk to Mr*
Laing and they talk to the other two people.

And I think this

is of key import, Your Honor, they talk to all three people*
'Ih® other two people disclaim any knowledge of the
money.

Laing claims knowledge of the money, and ownership

of the money*
The IRS then assesses. Your Honor, a §310,000 jeopardy
assessment and seizure against each of the three people.

They

assessed $930,000 in taxes, even though they only seised
$310,000»
Hew, Your Honor, later on we go and we want to file
a suit for a refund, figuring, “All right, fellows, you owe us
$150,000, give us back half the money*

We file a claim for

a refund, Judge, and we find out that they went even further
than -that, on their own initiative, with no notice to anyone,
the IRS has now gone and they've taken the $310,000 that they
have assessed each person, and they've distributed the $310,000
they seized*

They gave each person credit for $100,000, and

then 'they very graciously cut the assessment from 300 to 200»

49

But we still owe $100,000, go we can't bring a'refund

suit,
Now, we'r® in a position where it's our money, we
admit it’s our money, we say it's our $300,000. we file for a.
refund to the Commissioner, we gay, "Give us back $.150,000 and
we* XI fight over whether or not I'm

&

taxpayer,®

But they

won't even let us do that.
Now, Your Honor, there's been some conversation anc.
questioning this morning concerning the fact that the «- we i;?:. .
a right to a suit for refund.
things involved.

But, Your Honor, there's two

The time span is a minimum of six months

and a maximum of eighteen months on a suit for a refund.
For example, if the Commissioner terminates a year
on January 2nd, 1975, they terminate a tax year, you then
have to wait until the conclusion of 1975 to file for your
refund, twelve months.

You then file and the Commissioner can

sit bade and wait six months, so you have eighteen months.
In our case, the tax year was terminated on June
24th? nine months later, in March, after much negotiation,
we filed for the refund, and, granted, it was denied within
eight days,

But we still had a nine-month wait.

But, Your Honor, what's available to my client, to
this foreign national?

He does not have available to him a

refund suit, as a practical matter, because of the rule of the
Flora case, the non-full-payment rule.

50

Secondly, ray client is being discriminated against,
1 think invidiously, in that he has to make full payment and
is denied access to -til® non-prepayment form in the Tax Court,
which is where, we want to go.
Why is ha denied, or how is he denied access to the
Tax Court?

Vary simply, the government won11 issu© a

I have been trapped like most lawyers into arguing

on the IRS grounds, because of a basic unfarailiarity with the

I still don't know why you need — I don't

know why there had to be an assessment to issue a notice.
MR. OTERIs Well, Your Honor, in that particular
situation, then, -there’s no problem —

need a notice to get in the

MR. OTERIs

Ho question I need what they call a

All it takes# Your Honor# **•*»
Let’s assume that the government ernes

out in th© middle of the night and seises your cash and gives
you a piece of paper that says you owe some taxes.

And#

furthermore, you owe $190,000 worth of taxes.
Now, why isn’t that a notice of deficiency?

Because

it wasn't on a form or what?
MR. OTERIs

1 think because it’s not the statutory

notice that's required by 'the Code, Your Honor,
QUESTIONs Well, how do you know it isn't?
MR. OTERIs

Well# quite frankly# four Honor, again

I'm fighting them on their own grounds, and I've gone for their
bait, instead of fighting on th© grounds that in effect there
is a deficiency created by the very fact that a 6851 was filed.

But, again, Your Honor, if I go for that, and I do
now petition the Tax Court without a ruling from you, 1*11
probably fee thrown out on a jurisdictional ground from the Tax
Court snd have to be back her® again in a year, if you will
allow me to, to try to convince you that this avenue has been
foreclosed to me*
You see, my biggest problem, Judge, on a constitu­
tional basis, basically, is that I have a foreign national whc

has his money taken away from him, and he has nowhere to go*
Do you realise, Your Honor, that up till today,
three yearn and four months

three years and three months

after the seizure, there's still been no assessment of putting
aside, or any kind of letter issued»

I thought he was down in New Zealand*
No, he's back in Wales*
He's in Wales now*
Yes, Your Honor*

And still has no money,

though, and calls me collect, Your Honori'
But the fact of the matter is that in this particular
case, constitutional rights that are guaranteed to American

54
citizens, the rights of access to a court, have been denied
this man.

And, most importantly, Judge, —
QUESTION? Well, you*re claiming constitutional rights

for your man, to©?
MR, OTERXs
Laing,

Yes, Your Honor, that’s what I did for

1 mean, just thinking, Your Honor, in this particular

case, you can't terminate a probation without a hearing, you
can’t take away a welfare check without: a hearing, you cannot
condemn obscene material without a prior hearing? but in my
particular rami*a case, whether there's any adjudication prior
to the fact that the money is seized that he is a taxpayer,
he’s taken «« hie money is taken away from him»
If I concede, arguendo only, that because of the
peculiar natur® of this case, perhaps the government had a
right to hold that money for a short period of time while there*
was a determinationa
But, Your Honor, three years, three years and four
months, with no action whatsoever by the government could
demonstrata to any kind of an impartial judicial body that in
fact there was justification for the seizure, by the fact that
this man was a taxpayer, seems to me to fly in -the face of all
our constitutional guarantees of due process0
And, even further, Your Honor, toe fact that my mar.
not only has lost the use of the money, but my man doesn't have
any forum readily available to him to determine that the money

55
shouldn’t be paid to the government anyway e
where we have nowhere to go.

We’re in a position

We can’t go on the refund suit,

because of the Flora rulej ws can’t go to the Tax Court
because of the no deficiency? and we can’t get any kind of &
hearing to determine whether or not the government has the
right to assess taxes and seize money on a totally specious
basis.
Going back to that, Mr. Perry, Your Honor, who was
the Internal Revenue agent who cams to Derby Line, where ray
man was with the money, when he came there, Your Honor, he' set
$310,000, the exact amount, of money that was seised, as -the
tax due and owing.
Now, we talked, we had a deposition with him, we
couldn’t go into how he set it, only generally.
But in Rimieri, which is a Southern District of New
York case, which I’m sure you’re familiar with, a Frenchman
was arrested at Kennedy Airport with $247,850 on his person.
The IRS was called in.

The IRS set a. tax of $247,500? they

left him $320, and seised his money.
When the agent, a Mr. 'Vida was on the witness stand
in New York at the hearing which was granted by a District
Court. Judge, they went into how the assessment was made.
And the attorney for Rimieri asked the agenti

" In fact, sir,

weren’t you sent there for the specific purpose of seising
the exact amount of morse;/ that was found?"

And he said yes.
