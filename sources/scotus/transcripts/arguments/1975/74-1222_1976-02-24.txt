MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argument

next in No. 74-1222, Wolff against Rice.
Mr. Rammerlahr, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN KENT KAMMERLOHR
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

This is a case where the then Warden Wolff, of the

Nebraska penitentiary — h© is no longer there — is now a
petitioner in this cas®.

The case was brought by Mr. David Ric©

under 28 U.S.C. 2254 to primarily contest the admission at his
trial of some dynamite, dynamite caps, tools, other paraphernalia,
and also later some dynamite particles found in his clothing
at fch© police station.
Briefly how this cas© arose, your Honors, on the early
morning hours of August, 17, 1970, th® polic© station in Omaha,
Nebraska received a 911 emergency call
screaming.

that a woman was

It sounded like perhaps sh© was being rap@d, and

a, certain location was given.

Two patrol cars were dispatched,

a third patrol car heard the message and also went to the
location, Ohio Street in Omaha, Nebraska.

Upon entering the

premises, Officer Larry Minard saw a suitcase on the floor
which h© moved slightly, and th® suitcase exploded, killing
Officer Minard, injuring two other policemen, demolishing th®

4
house„
About £iv® days later, on the 22nd of August 1970,
tli© police had, during those five days,

working around

the clock trying to get evidence, and so on, had learned from
witnesses that the bomb had been, planted by one Duan® Peak,
who was a member of the National Committee to Combat Fascism,
which was also considered, or said to b© in th® case and
referred to as an officer of the Black Panthers organisation *
QUESTION;

This situation that you are speaking of

now doesn't form any of th® predicate for the issuance of the
search warrant, does it?

You ar® just giving background at

this point»
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

Yes, I am just giving background»

But that was, you say, information in the

possession of the police at that time.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes, your Honor.

And also as a result of this information and prior
building of records over a two-year period of newsletters put
out by the National Committee to Combat Fascism, that they had
advocated violence to police officers, including th® killing
of police officers, plus some other evidence they had gathered
that perhaps one Edward Poindexter, who was a member of the
National Committee, an. officer, president, I believe, of the
National Committee to Combat Fascism, and Duane P@ak.
Arrest warrants were issued for those two members.

5
The police started on what they called a task force
on tli® late afternoon of August 22, first went to the
headquarters of the National Committee to Combat Fascism.
They went through the headquarters looking for these two parsons
that they had an arrest warrant for and did not locate them.
They then went to Poindexter’s home, did not locate him there.
They went to a cousin’s home of Duane Peak, th® cousins5 names
were Frank and Will Peak.

And then they went to th® home of

David Bice, who is th® respondent in -this case.
QUESTION;

And up to this point, what warrants, if

any,did they have?
MR. KAMMERLQHR:

Up to this point they had arrest

warrants for Duan© Peak and Edward Poindexter, your Honor.
QUESTION;

And not for th® respondent.

MR. KAMMERLOHR;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

And no search warrant up to this point.

.MR. KAMMERLOHR;

At this point.

I would like to point out til at they did not

I

think th© opinion in th© United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit does a disservice to this cas® by comparing it.
to Lankford v. Gelston where some 300 nonrelated searches war©
made.
QUESTION;

That was that Baltimore case?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes, your Honor.

In this cas© there w@r© only -three searches mad®

6
before they arrived at the Rice premises* and aven those were
connected
QUESTION:

Did they search anything at the first

two stops?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
headquarters»

Th«y searched the premises at the

At the other two stops the record is not clear

just what they did.

They went there looking for them.

I

believe at the one place there was a police officer there
already who assured them that neither on® of the subjects
were on th@ premises.
QUESTION:

Just to pursue what Mr. Justice Stewart

has mentioned, at that point the mission was to execute, to
serve, an arrest warrant for two people who

are not involved

in this case.
MR. KM-MERLOHR:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Jus tic-3.

They were all three members of the party, fch© National
Committee to Combat Fascism, which had been previously connected
in the cas® by the fact that Duane Peak was said to have planted
th@ bomb for the National Committee to Combat Fascism.
QUESTION:

Was said by whom?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

His sisters and Donald Peak,, a

brothershad given this information to the police.
QUESTION:

Had that information been published, made

public- to the public generally?
wasn't there?

The.re was a newspaper,

7
MR. KAMMERLOHRs

It was mad© public to the — all

the police officers wer© cognizant of this.

Several witnesses

had seen Duane Peak carrying a heavy suitcase and telling
people# "Don't touch it," on the night before the bomb was
planted.
QUESTION;

And that was Peak,

MR, KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTIONS

Yes# your Honor,

Who was on® of fcha two subjects of fete

arrest warrants,
MR, KAMMERLOHRs

That*3 correct.

Upon arrival# late at night# mayb© 9:30# 10 o'clock
at night at David Rice's premises, the lights were on#
a television set was playing# they could see through the door,
Th® police knocked on the door and there was no response
and at this time two of the police officers decided they
should go back and see if they could get a search warrant.
They left the other officers there to surround the house# and
th® two officers went back to the police headquarters and
drafted an affidavit and found themselves a magistrate who —
incidentally# in Nebraska all magistrates are members of th®
Nebraska bar in good standing.

They presented th® affidavit

to the magistrate who issued the search warrant for the
premises describing 'the exact address of David Rice's premises
and the things to b® seized QUESTION'S

And what were they?

8
MR. KAMMERLOHR;

Dynamite, dynamite caps, pliers,

pincher-nose pliers, and those kind of —
QUESTIONS

All described in the search warrant?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTIONS

It's in the appendix, your Honor.

We will find it.

MR. KAMMERLOHRs

I believe it's on page 10 of the

appendix.
QUESTION;

Pliers aren’t — it’s not quit® so explicit

as you indicated, as 1 read it.

Dynamite and illegal weapons,

also the devices which might be used to construct weapons or
explosive devices which could be used to causa injury to
persons or damage to property.
MR. KAMMERLOHR;

Is that it?

Yes, your Honor.

It doesn’t say

pliars and the wire.
QUESTION;

But genetically it does say what you have

indicated.
MR. KAMMERLOHRs

In any case,

the two officers

With the search warrant want back to the Rice premises and
all of the officers entered the premises and found the? evidence
which is objected to in this case.
upon entering the premises.

It was all in plain sight

They didn't have to overturn

anything or open any drawers or anything of -that nature.

Court of Nebraska ~~

QUESTIONS

On® thing that worries me.

th® police war© there all this time,, didn't they?

They knew
Didn't th®

police first go and rap on the door?
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
QUESTIONS

Yes, your Honor.

They knew the police were there.

MR. KAMMERLOHR;

There was no on© ther® inside th®

premises.
QUESTION;

And when they went back.

MR. KAMMERLOHRs

Thor© was still no on® inside the

premises, your Honor.
QUESTIONs

That's what 1 was trying to get straight.

QUESTION;

Didn't they stake out the house?

MR. KAMMERLOHRs

They staked out th© house while

they were gone.
QUESTIONS

And sent an officer to get th© warrant

that you just referred to on pages 10 and 11.
MR. KAMMERLOHRs

Two officers to get the warrant.

Th® rest stayed and staked out th© house.
QUESTION;

And th© house was empty, as I understand

it, at all relevant times, although there wer© lights on in
th© house and I think a television set was turned on.
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

But. nobody in th® house.

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

No people in th®re.

Before the actual trial, th® respondent movsd for

10
suppression In the District Court of Douglas County, which is
in Omaha. -

The District Court denied suppression of th® evidence

The Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed, finding that th®
affidavit for search warrant was sufficient.

The Federal

District Court in th® 2254 case than found that th© affidavit
for search warrant was not sufficient.

W® than had later,

after’that order was first, -- 'that order of several months
previous to another order which th® Federal District Court
later issued finding that there war® not any other grounds,
either, authorising legal entry into the premises.
Th® United States Court of Appeals affirmed and w@
than petitioned this Court and are h@re, and although I hav©
a number of issues in my brief and in our petition for
certriorari, 1 would lik© to primarily argue two main points
which, we would urge this Court to adopt.

We would still like

to rely, of course, on our other points in our case should
those be denied.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Hammerlohr, b@£or® you proceed, may

1 ask you, do w® hav® in the papers filed her© a copy of th©
opinion of th® Supreme Court of Nebraska?

MR. KAMMERLOHR;

As I alluded to in my brief# this

Court of course is very familiar with fch© arguments against
the exclusionary rule and for the exclusionary rule# and there
has been dissatisfaction mentioned a number of times, so that

I do not intend to go into all those various cases and try to
tell this Court th@ same thing you are very familiar with
and take up your time and fch® time of. others here.
I do think I should mention just briefly why w@ do
not feel that# number on©# the exclusionary rule should apply
when officers are acting under a search warrant.
the Court to modify the exclusionary rule

We would ask

at the very least

to that point.
The magistrate par haps was the person who was wrong#
if anyone were wrong, in issuing a search warrant in this cases.
I do not believe that we can blame — or the purposes of the
exclusionary rule would b@ served if the purposes are to
»
*

deter unlawful action of police where they have tried to do

what's right, they have gone to a lawyer-magistrate and asked
for a search warrant.

I don't see how there can b@ any

possibility of deterrence to future cases because it's th®
type of procedure we operate under, it's a preemptory type,
there is no way of having, an immediate hearing to sa@ if the
writ is any good.

The police certainly wouldn't b© in any

position every time they get a search warrant to question its
validity.
We encourage the us® of search warrants , and I
believe the imposition of the exclusionary rule would go more
to discourage th® us® of search warrants than to encourage them.
So for those reasons and for the avowed purpose of
th© exclusionary rui©, I would ask th© Court to at least
modify the exclusionary rul® to that extent when officers ar©
operating under a search warrant.
QUESTION;

Generally, I suppos® you would mean --

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Generally, I would ask when they

are operating in good faith and. think that they ar® following
th© law, that th© exclusionary rule serves no purposes.

And

in that light generally I might also say 1 know we are all
interested in seeing that we have the'preservation of freedom
and. privacy in this country, but th© exclusionary rule, as this
Court well knows, doss absolutely nothing to protect those
who don't have any guilty evidence on their premises.
police should suddenly take it into their heads

If th©

to become

a police states or Nazi type state, the general public who
doesn’t have any guilty evidence on their premises would have
absolutely no remedy under the exclusionary rule.

They are

just not protected.
The same is true when the police take it into their
heads to harass gamblers or houses of prostitution, or anything
else where they don’t want the evidence to b® used, in court
tout they merely want to either gather the evidence to destroy
it dr they want to let them know that they are awar® of their
operations,

the exclusionary rule does those people absolutely

no good.
Now, we can’t, measure

The Constitution itself wouldn’t help

them, would it?
HIS. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

I believe it could ~~

At the time you are talking about.

have been suggested, I believe they could, your Honor.

QUESTIONS

If you say that police are going to knock

down doors and all, that knocks down the whole Constitution,
doosns ’ t it?
MR. KAMMERLOHRs

Unless w@ do provide a better

remedy than the exclusionary rule.
QUESTION:

We don’t know that they hav© been

14
suggested necessarily as alternative r<sm©dies? they have bean
suggested as additional remedies, have they not?

Maybe th®

exclusionary rule only serves to ©ffeefcuafc© th® fourth
amendment in the context of a criminal trial.

But other

remedias are at least theoretically available to effectuate
that constitutional provision in other contexts, 1.©., civil
lawsuits. The Bivens case you are familiar with, aren’t you?
And that5s not an alternative to th.® exclusionary rule? it’s
an additional sanction, is it not?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

That’s correct, your Honor.

I

believe that was probably a 1983 case, was it not?
QUESTIONS

It was not.

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Well, I believe anyway that there

is a remedy under 42 1983.

But there might be

Bivens

That’s th® reason it wasn’t

But as against State agents there might be 1903 remedies

And these a.-

not alternatives, they are additional remedies,

are they not under the present state of the law.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Under the present state of the law,

but I am just saying that those writers like Dallin Oaks,
Professor Oaks, and Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I believe,in
the dissent on Bivens
QUESTION:

suggested that •—
There was a dissent, wasn't there?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
((

— if we should move away from the

15
exclusionary rule completely, we should have an alternative
remedy.
QUESTION:

We do have those remedies.

There is

considerable question about the efficacy and practical value,
but they are now there, are they not?
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:
QUESTION:

Yes, they are.

You are not suggesting or trying to

invent anything that's not already there, are you?
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:
QUESTION:

I'm not suggesting —

You are suggesting that we take away

something, not that we add something, isn't that correct?
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:
QUESTION;

Well, I'm suggesting —

From what's presently there to effectuate

the
MR. KAMMERL0H11:

1 am suggesting that the exclusionary

rule doesn't do a thing for these certain classes that I was
mentioning.
QUESTION:

That's correct.

MR, KAMMERLOIIR:

I'm suggesting that we do add some­

thing .
QUESTION:

They are already there.

What would you

add?
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:

I would make a requirement that

before the exclusionary rule be completely abandoned by this
Court in all cases, that the States must provide a tort remedy

16

with a minimum recovery for the person who is injured against
the governmental subdivision who employs the police»
QUESTION:

So what -— we should wait for, assuming

that we might reconsider the exclusionary rule, we should not
do so until a majority of the State legislatures had acted or
a majority of the State courts had acted providing a specific
tort remedy with a minimum amount, of recovery?

Is that your

suggestion?
MR, KAMMERLOIIR:
QUESTION:

I am suggesting that you could •—•

I don't understand that»

MR, KAMMERLOIIR:

— that you could impose that in an

opinion to make an incentive for legislatures to move ahead
and do this.
QUESTION:

You mean a conditional holding,where the

state provides an alternative remedy, then Mapp v■ Ohio is out»
MR» KAMMERLOIIR:

Yes, your Honor»

I believe that

could be done by this Court»
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be your guess that every State

in the Union, including Alaska and Hawaii, probably have such
a tort remedy right now?
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:

Not with any minimum recovery»

I

think that's the problem with most of them, the people are not
materially injured very much in these cases, so they don't even
Dother to bring the tort remedy because they might get a few
dollars back and it wouldn’ t be worth them —

17
QUESTION:

You are suggesting there

recovery even — what?

be a minimum

First of all there has to b© a finding

of liability, doesn't there?

And then normally recovery is

keyed to the amount of damage»

You are suggesting, what,

punitive damages, that a State must create a cause of action
and. allow for minimum punitive damages before the exclusionary
rule should be reconsidered, at least with respect to that
State, is that your suggestion?
MR* KAMMERLOHR:

It would be a form of those, your

Honor, yes, punitive damages against —
QUESTION;

.Hobinson-Patman,
*•

treble damages

■

plus attorneys fees?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes, your Honor.

Of course, I am not advocating that in this case as
far as the search warrant.

I think this Court should not

impose the exclusionary rule in cases where, as I mentioned
earlier, they are searching under a search warrant.
QUESTION:

No matter how inadequate a warrant?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

That's correct.

I don't believe

that. — unless there is some showing of collusion or fraud or
something like that, or the police actually lie in their
affidavit, something of that nature, perjury.
QUESTION:

That's providing the magistrate is

a lawyer and disconnected from the police department entirely.
MR. KAMMERLQIJR:

Well, that's what 'they are in our

18

case.

I don't know how many -—
QUESTION;

But that’s th© situation you are talking

about.
MR. KAMMERLOHR;
QUESTION;

He

Yes, sir.
has

no connection with the police

at all.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

He has no connection.

He is

supposed to be interposed between thss police and the public.
I believe that if someone were to be —- if some sort of a
sanction were to be imposed, it ought to be imposed on th®
magistrate.

We should do away with th® absolute protection that

the magistrate has in this type of case, which I believe is a
court-made rule.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that a magistrate be

what, criminally or civilly liable* for doing what?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

I am suggesting that a magistrata

who is grossly negligent should have some sort of liability or
els© his employer should, and remove the absolute immunity the
magistrates now enjoy.
QUESTION:

That would cut across a good deal of

judicial immunity, would it not?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
Honor.

It would cut across sortie, yes, your

I believe it would be fair —

QUESTION: We have recently had some there

haven't we?
Several cases.

r
19

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

I believe it would be on®

possibility at least as an alternative rather than to say -that
we are trying to deter the police who cannot possibly understand
all of the intricacies of th® search and seizure law.

Also,

a lot of prosecutors don't understand the intricacies of the
search and seizure law.
QUESTION;
on this.

You said you were going to make two points

You have made one now.

What is your second one?

You have only about two or three minutes left.
MR. KAMMERLOHR;

My time got away from me, your

Honor.
The other part which I strongly urge this Court to
adopt was the — I believe I can refer to the easiest and the
Court will know what I am talking about —- is Mr. Justice
Powell's concurring opinion in Schneckloth v. Dusfcamonte that
the Federal courts not consider search and seizure.
QUESTION;

If we agree with you on that, w® needn't

consider the former.
MR. KAMMERLOIIR;
QUESTION;

Pardon, your Honor?

If ws agree with you on that, we needn’t

consider th® argument we have just mad® about modification of
the rule.
MR. KAMMERLOHR;
QUESTION;

You, need to consider?

We wouldn't need to consider it.

MR. KAMMERLOHR;

Oh, the one I just made.

Well, I

20
think the two

could work together in some cases.

It is

rather a fallback position, but I think —
QUESTIONS

Which is the fallback position according

to you?
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:

The first argument.

I believe that the second argument is based on
th© violation of the 4th amendment is connected with a
colorable claim of innocence plus an opportunity to be heard
in a State court and to air these issues.

Now, I can't conceive,

right off where th® second issue would need to foe, but there
could be a possibility, I suppose, where th® petitioner is
claiming that the 4th amendment resulted in him being unjustly
convicted because he was innocent and he had a valid opportunity
to contest it and y«t it was under a search warrant,

tod if

we didn't adopt the first issue, then he would still be able
to bring it up under the invalid search warrant, in those
cases only, however, because nobody here wants an innocent man
convicted.
continue,

I believe that's a point that should be allowed to
I believe everybody would agree to that, in 2254

cases.
In summary, then, I would urge the Court — or I would
say that we agree wholeheartedly with the concurring opinion
in Schneckloth and with Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice
Harlan in th© Kaufman case, in the dissent.
Thank you.

of this Court.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, I am not.

No, you make a point, in your brief that

it was a valid search.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

I make soma other points in my brief

which I haven’t argued, which I think ~
QUESTION;

(Inaudible)

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

The Eighth Circuit indicates --

The Eighth Circuit opinion is out. of line

with anything decided here.

22
HR. KAMMERLQIIR;

The Eighth Circuit was out of lin©

in comparing the case with Lankford vGelston and also with
saying that the police lost their exigent circumstances
argument by going for a search warrant.

Xtes trying to take

one for the other, you know, a trade-off of some type, and
they did leave a cordon around the empty house, and I don51
see how they can say that we lost our exigent circumstances
argument.
And, thirdly, I think th© court misconstrued fch©
Hayden case by saying that the police had to have probable
cause to believe that the persons they were .looking for were
there at the very time they entered the premises, because in
Warden v. Hayden, even though they knew th© persons were in
there, they did not have probable cause to open the washing
machine lid where they found th© weapon.

Nevertheless, that

was sustained.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Kammerlohr.

Mr . Cunn ingh am.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM. C. CUNNINGHAM
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

In the assignment of duties between counsel in our

case, my colleague, J. Patrick Green, from Omaha, Nebraska, was
to have presented the oral argument, and he has been
incapacitated yesterday by a severe attack of influenza.

23

I propose to deal with three points in the argument
for the court and be able to respond to questions from you,
and in this order?

First, wa think it of primary importance

to deal with the question added to the grant of the petition
for certiorari on 30 June last year, to wit, whether the
constitutional validity of the search and seizure performed
by the Omaha police under the circumstances of this case is
judicially cognizable under 28 U.S.C. 2254„
Almost in identical language, on that same day,
June 30th, in Powe11 v. Stone, the court again added that
question to the grant of certiorari and asked the parties
involved both to brief and to argue those questions.

So I

propose to deal with that question first.
Secondly, I would like to deal with the need for
Federal review at lower court level of Federal constitutional
questions.

And by the lower court level, I mean both the

United States district courts and the circuit courts of appeal,
with questions presented by State prisoners under 28 U.S.C. 2254
in seeking petitions for writs of habeas corpus.
Thirdly, I would like to present arguments regarding
the standards that should be used, by either State or Federal
courts to determine the constitutional validity of the search
in this case.
Addressing myself to the first question and transmitting
any discussion

of the facts which I think were brought out to

24

some extent by counsel for the petitioner, I could deal with
those in questions if the Court so desires.
QUESTION:

You think there are no significantly relevant

facts that have been omitted.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

X think, your Honor, when we take

the record in its totality, including and placing special
stress on the careful hearings, evidentiary hearings, in the
Federal District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, before Judge
Warren Urbom, all of which is before the Court, that we then
have the total facts of the case.

But absent those two

evidentiary hearings in March and July of 1974 before Judge
Urbom granted the writ of habeas corpus, I think the Court
would have had, had it coma on direct review, an inadequate
record before it.

So, as supplemented, then, by those

evidentiary hearings —
QUESTION;

They are all in the appendix,

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

are they?

They are, your Honor,, the relevant

portions of them.
Dealing, then, with the question of cognisability
that the Court has asked us to brief and argue, we have to ask
ourselves whether habeas corpus should be available.

This

was raised, of course, in the concurring opinion in Schneckloth v
Bustamante, and there, when Justice Powell, writing the
concurring opinion, cites in footnote 16 Professor Amsterdam
on certain finality interests that we:

are to be concerned

25
with in attempting to limit Federal collateral review, Justice
Powell realises, of course, that Professor Amsterdam was
talking about Federal collateral review for Federal prisoners
and not State prisoners .
QUESTION:

That was the Kaufman case.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Right.

And Professor Amsterdam was

very careful, I think, to make the point that he did not think
that those considerations need apply to State prisoners in
seeking Federal collateral review of their claims based upon
Federal constitutional violations.
The next year, in 1965, Professor Amsterdam wrote
a considerably longer and exhaustive artic3.e. Criminal
Prosecutions Effecting Federally Guaranteed Civil Rights,
discussing removal there, and habeas corpus petitions to avoid
State court action.

And I understand him to argue from that

Law Review article the need there is, especially in State
court proceedings, for some sort of Federal monitoring at
Federal district court and circuit court level of the application
of Federal constitutional standards to fact situations.
QUESTION:

This question could not have arisen before

the decision in Mapp v. United States.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Except in a Rochin type situation.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

Yes.

And Mapp was decided

in 196.1?

26
MR. CUNNINGHAM;
QUESTION:
arisen until then.

1961, your Honor.

And this question couldn't possibly have
And the Mapp opinion ~~ I haven't reread

it recently ■— was four members of the Court joined if and
the fifth, Justice Black, joined it only on the basis that it
involved compulsory self-incriraination rather than purely
4th amendment.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Yes, your Honor.

But I take it that ever since then —
QUESTION;

It has been solid.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

— it has been solid, and that the

circuit courts have consistently applied it and the Federal
district courts, and so has this Court.
QUESTION:

This problem could not have arisen, and

therefore, at the earliest goes back to the decision in Mapp v.
United States.
MR. CUNNINGHAM;
QUESTION:

Indeed, your Honor.

Yes, sir.

And then there was a conflict, I. gather,

in one of th® circuits after Mapp as to whether or not this
kind, of a claim, 4th amendment type claim was available on
Federal habeas corpus in reviewing a Scat.® conviction.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Right, your Honor.

And that was never — it. was only rather

implicitly resolved in this Court, wasa*t it, because Kaufman
involved a Federal review of a Federal conviction.

27

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

2255.

And it was not until, what case?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

We would say, your Honor, in this

Court’s treatment of Linkletfcer, this Court took from the
Fifth Circuit in 1963 a habeas corpus case, and in 1965 this
Court took jurisdiction in Linkletfcer v. Walker and decided
the case on its merits.

This Court could not have taken

jurisdiction if there had not been jurisdiction in the courts
below.
QUESTION:

Although the question th® Court dealt

with in Linkletfcer was retroactivity -MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

True enough.

retroactivity of Mapp.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

True.

But it. was a habeas corpus

case.
QUESTION:

So that was implicitly sub silentio, if

you will, adopted this rule by this Court without any explanation
or explication or maybe realization.
CUNNINGHAM:

But other district courts, the;

district courts of appeal, for example, in Thornton v. United
States, the District Court of Columbia realized the distinction
there was between a Federal prisoner seeking Federal review
and a State prisoner and allowing, in the opinion in that
court, State prisoners should have this device of reviewing
a State conviction against them.

28

QUESTION:

Mr. Cunningham, I suppose you could turn

that argument around in view of all that w© have said about,
comity and federalism in cases like Younger and Q8 Shea and
say that even though it's perfectly proper to have a Federal
collateral review of a Federal conviction within a unitary
system, perhaps the same principle ought not to obtain where
you are talking about a Federal system with a Federal court
reviewing a State conviction.
MR. CUNNINGHAM.:

I know how sensitive th© Court must

be to questions of canity like that, and I read your opinion
for th® Court in Huffman v. Pursue, seeing v/hat I could get
from it.

And although I road two paragraphs and a very careful

footnote, I still could be led to th® conclusion that your
Honor decided there, writing for the Court, allowed that if
indeed there would be subsequent criminal prosecution, which
at that tima was threatened, that if a Federal constitutional
claim was in question, that the proper time to review it would
have been in collateral Federal habeas corpus review of a
State court conviction later on, but not to stop th© process
before it began.
So I have construed Huffman v.,Pursue to say at
least that.
QUESTIONs

Well, certainly one wouldn't necessarily

treat all constitutional claims the same, I suppose.

That is,

perhaps right to counsel and that type of thing might be

29
treated differently than 4th amendment.

AXI I am suggesting

is that while certainly the argument you make that it is more
important when a Federal court is reviewing a State conviction
than when a Federal court reviews a Federal conviction, you
can say just the opposite in view of the federalism consideration MR. CUNNINGHAM;

True enough, but I would think that

it5s easy to understand that the State court's primary allegiance
could be to the enforcement of their own criminal law,

They

stand responsible to do that and to review questions of State
law and their own criminal statutes-and th© imposition of them
in matters that com© before them, correctly or not.

But that

Federal courts are to remove from that, if we are to guarantee
supremacy of th© Federal lav/, are better circumstanced to look
dispassionately upon a question that might involve an alleged
violation of Federal constitutional standards.
QUESTION;

times, including in opinions of this Court.
less good company.

You are in more or

But doesn't that — on what basis can one

denigrate the State courts of this country in that way to say
that they don't have the same kind of understanding of th®
Federal Constitution or that if they understand it, they are
reluctant to follow where their understanding leads?

That may

once have been true in parts of th© country a hundred years
ago.

It may have even been true more recently in other

parts

of fch© country, but what basis is there for making that kind of

30
an assumption?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

To make such a broad indictment, I

think, your Honor, would be irresponsible.

I do not want to

believe that a single State court judge would set out maliciously
to deprive anyone of a federally guaranteed constitutional
right.

And y®t when I look, for example — if this Court could

refer to page 117, I believe, of the respondent's brief, we
attempted

to — 119, excuse me — at footnote 5, we attempted

to take the record of the State Supreme Court in Nebraska in
reviewing whether or not a warrant, search warrant, was
sufficient in their State Supreme Court.

And the Court will

note there that on a number of occasions the, warrant was
sustained by the State Supreme Court, that certiorari was
denied on direct review by this Court, and that on Federal
collateral review, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had found
a warrant to fos insufficient.
QUESTION;

That doesn't necessarily mean that the

Eighth Circuit was right and the Supreme Court of Nebraska wrong,
does it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I couldn't, argue that, your Honor.

But, for example, from 1961, post Mapp, when I conducted that
search of cases, I find only one time "that the State Supreme
Court of Nebraska held a warrant to be insufficient, and that
was in 1975 in State v.Kallos where there was a lapse of nine
months between the facts alleged to establish probable cause and

31

fcho issuance -QUESTIGN;

Isn't the relevant statistic the number of

times fcfa© State trial courts hav© held warrants insufficient?
Those are probably not appealed.
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

That would be difficult to find,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

We are dealing with very sketchy information,

is what I am suggesting, when you point to one Supreme Court
opinion.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

True enough, but, for example, with

minute specificity in this case we see what a State Supreme
Court and State lower court did with a warrant so wanting in
probable cause as to leave no doubt in the mind of four Federal
court judges in very careful opinion and exhaustive, painstaking
evidentiary hearings to find that there simply was no basis for
the warrant.

It was based, quit© frankly, as the officer

testified, upon his speculation.

That's neither reasonable,

good faith, nor probable cause,
QUESTION:

Your footnote that you have just referred

to establishes just one thing, and that is that the Eighth
Circuit is a little mor© final than the Supreme Court of
Nebraska because it's subsequent.

Does it really establish

anything else at all?

I don't know

whether the situation has changed.

On© of the problems, as

I recall it, that troubled us then was that too many States
did not yet have adequate collateral proceedures.

As I

remember it, Nebraska adopted on® three or four days before
a case from Nebraska was to be argued here, and I don't know
how it has functioned since. 'Apparently from what you tell us
about this casa, at least in this case it hasn't functioned
too effectively.
MR. CUNNINGHAMs
QUESTION;

It seems not, your Honor.

Well, if there has been a suppression

motion, though, in the State courts and the 4th amendment issue
has been once presented in the Stata courts, a lot of States
won't let you in their collateral proceedings just to tak®
up an issue that has already been presented to its courts.

MR. CUNNINGHAMs

Your question again, your Honor?

I am sorry.
QUESTION:

Suppose a suppression motion has been

made and the 4th amendment issue has been passed upon by
a Nebraska trial court, the claim has been rejected, and that

Mr. Cunningham, the prospect is that in Nebraska we are not

Doesn't this depend on

the lawyer more than on ‘the judicial officer?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Perhaps to scan® extent, your Honor,

and the thoroughness with which he conducts an examination, and
yet I note that in answer to a question by Judge Urborn, th®

38
officer who had before furnished the information which led to
the issuance of the search warrant said, in answer to this
questions

Did you have any report from anyone that Duane Peak

was then inside the Rice house or had been inside the Ric©
house that day?

His answer:

No, sir.

The only thing wa had was a

speculation because it was a known house of that particular

That is so wanting in good faith, reasonableness, or
probable cause that I think it took everyone by surprise at

to the system, assuming th© adequacy and everything els© of
the State proceeding, if th© only Federal court — th© only

MS. CUNNINGHAM;

that 1 might by a decision talcs up jurisdiction that

by Congress.

that the cas© presented by this record where a man who has set

of that application by a judicial officer in Nebraska, that
*

that's a reasonable and appropriate price to pay and that that’s
the only way that we can accomplish that result.
Is that a fair statement of what underlies your

position?
MR. CUNNINGHAMs

I would not say that.

I would say

in answer to that, you have touched upon the point raised
initially in Justice 'Powell's concurring opinion in Schneckloth

v?hich is is there a colorable claim of innocens®?

Th® State

of Nebraska has said that no claim, much less colorable, had
ever been made by th© defendant, the respondent in this case,
in any real way.

That has been a matter of tremendous concern

to him and to his lawyers.
Justice Powell, in th© concurring opinion in
Schnecklofch says, at page 257, that guilt or innocence had
never been part of th© consideration, the proper consideration,
in granting habeas corpus or not.

it's compelled.
QUESTION:

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

If Congress is going to take it

that they know has been seized in contravention of the

QUESTION:

Incidentally, doesn’t the Safe Streets Act

of course, it’s congressional, but hasn't Congress enacted the
exclusionary rule in the Safe Streets Act both as to violations
of the Act by State officials as well as by Federal officials?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

I would think so.

Mr. Cunningham, if your rationale is the

correct one, that is, the Shelley v, Ky aerae rapproach, can

you

possibly justify a limitation on standing, have it only the
defendant who can raise the issue?

Wouldn't it be necessary

under that rationale that the point be available to the
defendant even though

it was some third party's rights who

are invaded by the search?

MR. CUNNINGHAM;

Indeed, in this case, your Honor,

tiie codefendant of David Rice has sought now unsuccessfully in
the lower Federal district court before fch© same Judge Warren
Urbean to raise the point about the unconstitutionality of the
search.

And Judge Orbom has held that he did not have the

requisite standing to raise the issue over the introduction
into evidence in a common trial against him of that evidence.
QUESTION s

Even though that holding may be correct

46
under Alderman, it would be inconsistent with your analysis,
I guess.
MR. CUNNINGHAM%
QUESTIONS

Yes, your Honor.

One question, Mr» Cunningham.

You suggested,

I think, that the exclusionary rule had something to do with
a fair trial, and I think that some of my colleagues implicitly
accepted that, suggestion that at least so long as the exclusionary
rule existed, it had something to do with a fair trial.
you really think so?

I’ve never understood so.

Do

I.always

thought it had to do with quite a different constitutional
value, i.e., enforcement of the protections of the 4th amendment
which by their terms had nothing to do with the trial, fair or
unfair, they have to do with unreasonable searches and seisures.
And insofar as probative,relevant, material evidence is
excluded from a trial, it leads to unfairness rather than
fairness, doesn’t it?

Because anything that impairs the

search for truth impairs the search for justice, and certainly
any rule that excludes relevant, material, probative evidence
impairs the fairness of a trial because it impairs the full
disclosure that a trial is supposed to accomplish, doesn’t it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Your Honor, I would not want to read

the 4th amendment just by itself.

I would want to include the

5th amendment as well, and say that the fairness of the hearing
is going to be Measured not just by whether or not there has

been a technical 4th amendment violation, but whether or not

47
the whole trial, including the introduction into evidence, the
opportunity to cross-examine the people who introduce the
evidence, and all the procedural safeguards —
QUESTION;

What part of the 5th amendment?

Th©

compulsory self-incrimination part of it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;
QUESTION;

Which?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Or due process, your Honor.

Both.

Certainly the Eighth Circuit didn't make
X

any finding that there had been any independent 5th amendment,
violation.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

No, your Honor, just a straight

violation of the 4th amendment.
QUESTION:

Are you contending that they should have

made such a finding?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I think their opinion as it stands

is perfectly adequate.
QUESTION:

Just to go back, I thought the whole

point of th© Linkletter — or at least a big part of the
point of the Link letter opinion was that ’th© exclusionary rule
didn't have anything to do with the fairness of the trial,
and insofar as it did have anything to do with the fairness of
the trial, the exclusionary rule impaired th© fairness of the
»
the
t.ria::. Wasn't that the point oty Link 1st tar opinion in saying
that th© Mapp

rule was thought to be retroactive?

43
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

Yes, your Honor, but I cannot see

that the introduction into evidence in any proceeding, State
or Federal —
QUESTION;

Of relevant, probative, material evidence

that would clearly be admissible except because of the way it
was obtained by the prosecutor?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

Yes, because I regard, your Honor,

the totality of the process, including the trial and subsequent
appeals, all of them, whatever allowed, to be part and parcel
of the whole process to determina guilt or innocence.

Until

that course be run, we do not know whether we have something
that's relevant or irrelevant to that issue.
QUESTION;

Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Justice Stewart has

given voice to one view ~~ I won't undertake to say whether
it’s fch© majority view or not — of the function of a trial,
that is, a search for truth.

But are you not by implication

articulating the contrary view that a trial in a criminal case
is a search for admissible truth — admissible truth — not
truth in the abstract?
MR. CUNNINGHAM;

<
Your Honor, I would want to say that

any It gal proceeding in its best aspects is precisely a search
for truth.
QUESTION;

Well, if you accept that, then accept

then on® of these two alternatives, then surely you must agree
with Mr. Justice Stewart that the exclusionary rule frustrates

49
defeats the search fox- truth, as this case so richly demonstrates,
MR. CUNNINGHAMs

If the subs@qi.ient. hearings had not

been held in this case and the Federal court had not had
revealed to it the real circumstances that lay behind the
issuance, the application for an issuance of the search
warrant, w® would have no check upon this whole procedure.
And I cannot believe that the Stats —
QUESTION:

A check then on procedure, not on substance.

It is a check on procedure to see to it that the only evidence
that comes in is evidence acquired in accordance with
the Constitution as construed by this Court.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

So that as a result ultimately Justice

Cardoso8s prophecy came true that on some occasions the
Federal courts have e5cc3.ud.ad the actual evidence of the body of
a

murder victim because of the way in which the police learned

of the location of the concealed body.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Is that not -true?

That has happened, your Honor, and

I think the Eighth Circuit Court, of Appeals faced that issue
squarely at the end of their opinion when they said that,

"We

consider it necessary to point out that the record discloses
a widespread search for the suspects Peak and Poindexter which
evinced at least a negligent disregard by the Omaha police for
constitutional rights of not only petitioner, but possibly other
a police search is at least reminiscent

s.

50
of police conduct condemned in Lankford v. Gelston»
QUESTION:

What dees that have to do with tli© core,

of this case?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I think* your Honor* they said that

though -they found evidence* some evidence of guilt, the whole
procedure, because of fell© introduction of this evidence on an
invalid warrant invalidated the whole proceeding, and that in
order to b® fair, one has to go back and try the case without
the introduction into evidence of this illegally seized evidence.
QUESTION:

Of the dynamite and the caps and all that

sort of thing.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Yes, sir.

It is entirely possible

fchett that dynamite could have bean planted.
QUESTION:

How about the dynamite fragments in fch®

cuffs of his pants, was that planted, too?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

It could have been, your Honor.

That's quite a different question -whether

it was illegally seised.

I mean, there is -no connection between

the claim that it might have been planted and the claim that
it was illegally seized.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Corroboration was necessary for

an admitted accomplice in the murder, Duane Peak, and
corroboration was found in what later proved to be, according
to the district court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, an
illegal and unconstitutional search.

But it furnished the

51
corroboration for the State court in affirming the convictionQuite simply corroboration is needed for Duane Peak, and it
came as a result of an illegal search.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Cunningham, I hesitate to detain you,

but this is a very important case and you are very well
prepared and are arguing it vary well, indexed.

I want to emm

back to a question I asked you as to whether Congress had
authority to change the exclusionary rule, which you view as
required by the Constitution.
If I understood your answer correctly, you said that
Congress could change the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the
Federal court.

I myself don’t think it's necessary to do that

for this purpose, but put that aside, are you saying that
Congress had no authority to modify in any respect or to revoke
the exclusionary rule in the Federal courts ?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I believe, your Honor, I would have

to say that they had the power to do that.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Would they have to —

If it’s a constitutional requirement.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

My question is, would they have to

amend the Constitution to do it.
QUESTION:

Well, Congress can amend the Constitution.

You are saying there would have to be a constitutional
am :iidv-.ent to change a judge-mad© rule that was not even

52

extended to the States until 1961»
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

And this Court’s decisions putting

it as part and parcel of -the 4th amendment,
QUESTION:

And you find all of this in the language

of the 4th amendment?

Nowhere else, is it?

MR, CUNNINGHAM;
QUESTION;

No, your Honor,

Well? it’s

MR, CUNNINGHAM;

in Mspp

v. Ohio,

In other decisions of this Court

and the extension of the right of privacy, too, under
subsequent decisions.
QUESTION;

It's in the opinion of four Justices at

that time, but more than four sine© then have said it is not
a constitutional requirement — in Calandra, for example.
MR, CUNNINGHAMS
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor,

Of course, if it is a constitutional

requirement, I suppose it’s really no different than the right
of counsel which has developed over the years.

That's also

constitutionally compelled, isn't it?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

As,well as otter constitutional

rights that were taken from the Bill of Rights — the right to
privacy, the right to freedom of association, things like that
that the Court has seem and interpreted from the Constitution.
One final thing I would be -—
QUESTION;

Do any of 'those rights deprive the trial •

of facts in litigation, an opportunity to consider th© most

53

relevant evidence on the issue of truth, which you say is the
object of trial?

Do any of these other —

MR. CUNNINGHAM: Converstion.
QUESTION:

which ones?

Both.

The right to counsel does not.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I think in Katz, for example, when

we said that the evidence might have been tremendously relevant,
but there was a rightful expectation of privacy and although
there had not been a physical intrusion, that right of
privacy was sufficiently broad to be protected by the introduction
of admittedly relevant evidence.

The search for truth is really not always

the objective, tie primary objective in litigation in our
courts.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

QUESTION:

Vary often trials devote more time to

trying th® police than they do til© defendant, is said by a
number of people.

54
MR. CUNNINGHAMs

An unfortunate distraction, but to

leave them less than wholly cross-examined, I think, would be
sort of remiss, too.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cunningham, your reference to Rochin

inevitably brings up the question of the Schmerber case where
it did not shock the conscience of the court to put a needle
in the man's veins and withdraw a sufficient amount of blood
to determine the alcoholic intake of the man at that period.
Does that not suggest that even at the risk of
oversimplification, that the same processes which brought new
light on the Constitution, let. us say, 20 years ago might
bring new light on the Constitution today?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Indeed.

The Constitution, I think,

must continue to grow and to be interpreted.

I remember

Justice Douglas in an answer in a colloquy over a paper called
"Two Paces of Federalism" saying 'that h© found it difficult,
to describe due process,< but Justice Holmes had approached it
one time in a letter, not in an opinion, in which he said

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN KENT KAMMBRLOHR
ON BEHALF. OF RESPONDENT
MR. FSJ.iKEHbOHRs

First I would like to point out that

56
even though counsel claims, and Mr. Rica makes some claims
of innocence, what Mr. Justice Powell is talking about and
Mr. Justice Black and Harlan and Stewart in the Bustamonte
case and the Kaufman cases was a claim under the 4th amendment?
we are talking about the 4th amendment, that if habeas corpus
were allowed in the 4th amendment, it would reveal a
colorable claim of innocence, then they should preserve it in
those cases, but not a claim of innocence based on something
not under the 4th amendment.

I believe that's the

suggestion of those opinions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice Harlan advocated the claim

of innocence position in Kaufman?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

I don't think that’s correct.

MR. KAMMERLOHR;
that.

No.

I believe he didn’t

He didn’t lend it to that at least.
QUESTION:

I think he more than that (inaudible)

MR. KhMMERLGHR:

I am just suggesting it means a

claim of innocance under the 4th amendment, not a claim of
innocence, say, for insufficient evidence that the jury has
wrosly ruled a-;: a Inst them, which is what he is arguing her®
that maybe tbs jury was wrong.

But that wouldn’t be remedied

any by a ith amendment claim in habeas corpus.
Another point I would like to point out to the Court,
the motion few suppression in this case was handled by the

57
States district court, not the magistrate who issued the search
Warrant.

The magistrate issued the search warrant, then the

case came to the trial court level, which is a jury trial
level in Nebraska, and the motion was made in that trial court,
the same court who later held the trial, same judge.
QUESTION:,1

Under your Nebraska practice, the

custom

is to make 'the motion before trial.
MR. KAMMEPXOHRs
QUESTION s

Yes, your Honor.

Separate hearing.

Not at the time there is a proffer of the

evidence.
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Although I suppose it could he done at

the later time, too.
MR. KAMMERLOHr?

We have a procedure for interlocutory

appeal from the motion to suppress to the State Supreme Court,
and then I believe it can still be, I*m not certain if it
can still ns brought up at the time of trial.

I would certainly

think so.
QUESTION:

But. the custom is to file the motion to

suppress before the commencement of th® trial.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And that hearing is before the judge who

is going to try the case?
MR. K&MMBRLQHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, generally speaking.

Or at least one of th® judges

58

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

It has to b© one of our district

court judges.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Kanunerlohr, I thinks as I recall a

case in Nebraska, Nebraska adopted a counterpart of 2255 as
its post conviction procedure, did it not?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Is that still th© one?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

That's still th© on® we have.

And in this case could there have been a

proceeding under that ronady after th© Supreme Court affirmed
the denial of motion to suppress?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Not concerning the search warrant.

QUESTION:

Not.

QUESTION:

Because it had been considered on appeal

or because the State doesn't have a counterpart of the rule of

th® Kaufman case.

Pcxss the State say we are not going to

consider 4th amendment type claims on collateral?
MR» KA. YERLQHR:

No, it would be because the Supreme

Corset of Nebraska had already decided th© issue.
QUESTION:

And your collateral remedy, State collateral

re...idy, is Limited to new questions.

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

And that as a consequence of that, the

collateral attack is barred on traditional grounds.
ME., KAMMERLOHR;

I believe that's what would happen

if someone brought back in the district court a collateral
proceeding, the district judge would merely say this has all
been decided by the Stat© Supreme Court.
QUESTION;

Generally in habeas corpus you don't have

60
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

You say

it's the fact that there was

actually -the question litigated that forecloses it.
MR. KMtMERLQHR;

At least, Judge. Urhom — you are

correct it was actually litigated.

Now, the other question, the

search without the search warrant which I brought up in the
atfc Suprema Court was not litigated there because they held
the search warrant was valid.

But Judge Urbom said the fact

that w,. briefed it in the State Supreme Court was sufficient
exhaustion

in Federal court, which I disagree with also.
QUESTION;

fir. Cunningham seemed to assume and was

ooor, the; impression that the magistrate who issued the warrant

same ju.dj cial officer who passed on the suppression

motion

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION;

That’s incorrect.

Well, in a complex matter like this, it

seems -KSMJIERLOKRj

Another point that Mr. Cunningham

: xe ought up which highlights the bad part of having a Federal
■mi oas corpus proceeding years later is that when the evidentiary
hearing was held oaf or «a Judge Urbom, it was some four years
••■oftST the fact and the evidence is not clear at that time in
They had hundreds of ceises probably-sine©

Judge Urboni

was doing the questioning, and he

said, "How do you know -this?"
He said,

Judge Urboni arrived at the conclusion that Lieutenant Perry
was perjuring himself.
this t

And I think he put a lot of weight on

tod this is just ons of th® bad things that happen

by — 1 say Lieutenant Perry might have learned about it. in a

numbs.-r of ways and forgot how he learned about it, and didn• t
necessarily perjure himself.
QUESTION:

But you agree when there has been a

suppression bearing in the State court and a record made and

th® metier.. to suppress defied, that a Federal habeas corpus
court is not supposed to hold a hearing of its own unless, as
■ turd:, ;

irufj,

finds soraa defect in th® State court

proceeding.
MR. KAMMBKLQHRs
'QURoTR ". •

Yes, your Honor,

And what defect did Judge Urbom find in

the State court5s suppression hearing?

62
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTIONS

He didn't —

He must, have found something —

MR. K&MMERLQHR:

He got into it on the search

without a warrant issue, without a search warrant issue.
QUESTIONS

He shouldn't have held a hearing unless

there was some —
MR. KMMERLOHR;
on. the

S€arch

He didn’t hold an evidentiary hearing

warrant issue.

Once he found the search warrant

was invalid, the affidavit for the search warrant was invalid,
then he raised issues that nevertheless the police had a right
to be on the premises.

Then ha held an evidentiary hearing

on that question..
QUESTION;

The^e had never been a hearing on that

in the State court.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

No, your Honor.

The Supreme Court

never reached that.
QUESTION;

So you are really not. saying — you really

car ;k be saying that he was retreading ground that the State
court had gone over because it had never gone over that ground.
MR. KMCMElUiOHR:

No, I am merely saying that it shows

that the police officers’ memories may get kind of dim after
four years.
