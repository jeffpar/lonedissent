MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 74-884, United States against Powell.
Mr. Easterbrook, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EASTERBROOK:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The statute at issue in this case provides

that pistol revolvers and other firearms capable of being
concealed on the person are not mailable.

Interpretive

regulations of the Postal Services provide that the phrase
"all other firearms capable of being concealed on the parson"
includes but is not limited to short-barreled shotguns and
rifles, and that, a short-barreled shotgun includes but is not
limited to shotguns with barrels less than .18 inches in
length and an. overall length of less than 26 inches.
Respondent was indicted for mailing a savred-off
shotgun from one part of the State of Washington to another.
The evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that a shotgun
with a barrel length of 10 inches and an overall length of 22
inches, sawed off both on the barrel and on the stock, was
to
mailed by respondent/ Mrs. Theresa Bailey, who apparently
was not its intended recipient.
weapon over to the FBI.

Mrs. Bailey turned the

The FBI turned the evidence over to the

4
United State* Attorney»
Respondent admitted buying the shotgun, but denied
ever having altered it or mailing it«
QUESTION:

And what were the dimensions of this

shotgun?
MR. EASTERBROQK:

This shotgun had a barrel length

of 10 inches and an overall length of 22 inches, actually
22-1/8 inches, including the stock and the barrel.
QUESTION:

So it*s well within the regulations.

MR. E AS TE RB R-OOK;

It's well within the regulations,

and in fact, it’s well within the numerical definition set out
in other Federal statutes and in a Washington State statute
which prohibits the possession of similar sawed-off shotguns
with barrels less than 12 inches»
The jury was instructed that in order to convict it
had to find not. only that respondent mailed the weapon, but
that the weapon was capable of being concealed on a. person.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty.
The court of appeals reversed, holding that the
statute is vague as to all weapons that were designed as
shoulder weapons.

Apparently no matter how small cr readily

concealabla a weapon may be or whether it was so altered that
it is no longer capable of being used as a shoulder weapon,
the court held that the phrase "capable of being concealed on
the parson" is so uncertain in scope and application that it

5

cannot constitutionally be used by Congress, that Congress
should instead have used numerical definitions as it has done
in other statutes»

The court did not refer to the Postal

Service regulation, and the court made no attempt to clarify
or construe the statute in such a way that it would alleviate
the vagueness.
The only issue before ‘the Court, therefore, is
whether the phrase "other firearms capable of being concealed
on the person" is so devoid of meaning that it cannot be used
to support punishment, even if the particular shotgun is, as
the jury found in this case, capable of being concealed on
the person, and even if there is an entire class of weapons
clearly capable of being concealed on the person.
Cur point of departure is the general principle *—
QUESTION:

Did the court below ever get to whether

it’s vague as applied?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

No, the court naver did, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

It said on its face.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

It said as to all weapons that

were designed as shoulder weapons on its face, and it never
reached it as applied to this person.
QUESTION:

Is that issue still open?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
will be open on remand.

That issue is still open and it

It seems to us quite possible that a

6
sawed-off shotgun of an overall length of 15 inches is clearly
within the statute? a sawed-off shotgun with an overall length
of 32 inches might or might not be within the statute, and
•there would b© a vague ness-as-applied argument as to such -QUESTION;

If that were true, certainly the statute

is not vague either on its face or as applied.
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:
..

Yes.

In this case;.
So yo*i can support

your facial

by saying a sawed-off shotgun is plainly with.in

the —
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That there are at least some

sawed-off shotguns plainly within that statute,
QUESTION:

If you made that argument and we agreed

•with you, the issue wouldn't be open on remand >
MR. EASTERBROOK:

If you agreed as to the argument as

to all sawed-off shotguns, then it would not bo open on remand.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t that fo© a matter of fact?

Wouldn’t you have to prove that as part of your case if you
came in there with that 20-inch barrel?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Well, we proved as part of our

case in this case that this particular weapon was capable —
QUESTION:

You would have to convince* the'jury that

— if you prevail on this vagueness, if you prevail.in asking
us to reverse the judgment in this case, you would nonetheless wouidn * t you have the burden of proof in an ordinary prosecution

7
proving that this weapon is capable of being concealed —
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, we would.

— on the person to the jury's satisfaction

beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR. EASTERBROOKs

That's correct,.

And that issue

went to the jury in this can® and the jury was satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Easterbrook, the only evidence in this

case on that issue was to the effect that this weapon was
capable of being concealed on the person.

So there is no

conflict as to that, is there?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

We don't believe there is any

conflict on the evidence.
QUESTION s

Is there any evidence to the contrary?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

One Federal agent testified that

the weapon was bulky enough that it might cause a bulge.
QUESTIONs

Cause what?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Might cause a bulge under the

clothing if it is attempted to he concealed under the clothing.
And I think that created a .fair issue for the jury whether
that bulge was so observable that the weapon was not capable
of being concealed on the person in a realistic sense.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, the word "person”, is that

a 5-foot, 7-foot, 500 pound or 200 pound or 100 pound person?
That's the on® that gives me the trouble.

8

MR. EA3TERBR00K:

The statute didn't define the term

"person", Mr. Justice Marshal’.,

On the other hand, I think

the statuta gives several clues that v/ould enable someone who
attempts to comply with this statute to understand the statute's
meaning.

Perhaps the most important clue is the fact that

the statute provides that it applies to weapons capable of
being concealed on the person.

That 'would presumably mean a

person who was determined to conceal it and was wearing whatever*
clothing was necessary to conceal it.

Moreover it seams

reasonable that it would include at least a person of average
size and perhaps a person who could be
a weapon.

‘

for concealing

That is a fairly large person.
QUESTION-

Vaguer and vaguer.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

Pardon?

QUESTION;

The statute’s getting vaguer and vaguer.

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

The term "person" is one that applies

to people of different sizes.

I think there is nothing we can

do to make that go away.
QUESTION;

Well, as Justice Stewart says, it might

make a difference who the person was and
MR. EASTERBROOK;

As a question of fact for the jury

it might well make a difference.
QUESTION;

On the matter of this bulga, X suppose

a snub-nosed 38 caliber pistol commonly worn by police officers

9
often, in fact, creates a bulge that is noticeable.
MR. EASTERBROGK:

I think so, when worn under a

jacket.
QUESTION!

But clearly that would be subject to this

statute, wouldn't it?
MR. SASTEKBRGOK;

I think so.

And the same argument

about the siz© of a person is makabl© with reference no matter
how small those weapons may be.

For example, a very slight

person wearing tight-fitting clothing could not conceal a
pistol no matter how small that pistol might be.

It would

always have a tell-tale bulgs.
QUESTION;

Yes.

And if you took a 410 gauge shotgun

and cut it down to 8 inches and cut the stock down to a pistol
grip,which has bean done, you could conceal it by strapping it
on your leg, couldn't you?
MR. EATERBROOK:
QUESTION:

I think so, your Honor.

If you didn’t wear tight pants.

MR. EASTERBROGKs

Thera was testimony in this case

that, the place in which this shotgun could be usefully concealed
is under a pants leg, and since both man and woman wear pants',
presumably lb.at includes respondent1s pants leg.
QUESTION:

When you are outside, of the First Amendment

area what do you conceive to be the difference between vague
as applied and vague on its face?
MR. EASTERBROGK;

Our position is that the concept of

10
vague on its face simply has no meaning outside the First
Amendment area, and that the argument someone has to make is
that this statute did not give him notice that his particular
conduct was within the statute prescription.
To the extent it has any meaning at all, it's a very
delicate argument that there is no meaning in the statute,
period.
QUESTION?

Vague on its face — you mean “vague on

its face” doesn’t have any meaning.
MR. EAS TE EB ROOK:

Right, as applied to statutes other

than First Amendment, statutes»
To the extent the concept of vague on its face has
any meaning, it’s a very peculiar kind of meaning.

It’s an.

argument that the statute's words are so uncertain that no one
has any idea whatever whether his conduct is within the ambit
of the statute, whether there is a zone of uncertainty around
the statute, whether he could comply with the statute if he
attempted to comply.

That’s an exceptionally narrow class of

cases, and we submit it’s a very far cry from the situation
her©, because the statute refers to a number of things that
people might be able to judge if they were to look at the
statute and attempt to comply.

Concealability depends on a

number of factors within the experience of most people.
Shorter weapons can be more readily concealed than longer ones,.
Slim weapons are more readily concealed than bulky ones.

11
Light ones are more readily concealed than heavy ones.

Each

weapon possesses some combination of these characteristics,
and when taken in combination, they establish its concealability
or the lack of its concealability*
People of common understanding acknowledge that a
short, light, single-barreled weapon, sawed-off

as the Chief

Justice suggested, is capable of being concealed on most, if
not all, people,
QUESTIONi

Especially if they are bent on concealing

it, they will wear clothing that will facilitate the concealment,
is that not a reasonable assumption?
MR, EASTEKBROOK:

I think that’s correct, and I

think that's why there is significant certainty in this statute
provided by the term "capable of being concealed."

It refers

to the concealability of the weapon and not to what an average
person may be wearing on the street at a particular moment.
It directs the attention of a person who desires to comply with
this statute to the ability of the weapon to be concealed by
some person determined to conceal it,- to utilise the
capability of the sawed-off shotgun to be concealed.

Jhid, indeed,

common experience goes perhaps a little further than that and
suggests that the only reason for sawing off the barrel and
stock of a shoulder weapon is to permit its concealment on the
person.
Then, too, the standard under this statute is an

12
objective standard*

All of the factors we have suggested,

the length of the weapon, the weight of the weapon, th© balki­
ness of the weapon, depend on verifiable objective factors
pertaining to the weapon*

Th© statutes with which this Court

has been concerned and have struck down for vagueness depend
on subjective standards, such as the degree of annoyance caused
by standards, by conduct, or th© amount of harm to competitors
caused by particular conduct.

Whan the statute's meaning

turns upon the effect of th© conduct on third parties, it's
often hard for someone, even on© who seeks to comply, to assess
that conduct in advance.

H© can't know the ripples which his

conduct will propagate among other people.
Not so here.

The standard is objective, physical,

turns on an analysis of the gun itself, not on an analysis of
what the gun will do to other people or how they will react
to it.

In fact, as I have suggested before, perhaps the

proper construction of this statute is that all sawed-off
shotguns are within its scope.

And as Mr. Justice White

stated, if the Court agrees with us on that submission, then
there is no problem of vagueness as applied, or a vagueness on'
its face.
We acknowledge, as I have acknowledged before, that
there are words in the statute that include a potential for
uncertain application.

Th® word "person1' is not definite.

There is no reference "man."

The court of appeals thought that

13

was enough to strike the statute down.
QUESTION;

Do you think it’s any more or less vague

than the term used in many statutes "dangerous weapon”?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION;

I don’t think so, your Honor.

That presents an issue for a jury to

decide whether, as in on© case did, a Coca Cola bottle is a
dangerous weapon.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

That’s correct.

And it’s also

an issue, not only for the jury, but for the court through a
process of continued adjudicationi
number of cases that

Courts can hold after a

Coca Cola bottles are inside or outside

the statute’s gcop@, and those adjudications will giv® notice
to those who seek to comply with the statute as to the statute9»
meaning.
So here, this statute as well can be construed by
a court to eliminate most, if not all, of the problem of
vagueness.

That is, if this Court, or if the Ninth Circuit

had announced that sawed-off shotguns are so readily capable
of being concealed on the person that they are within the
statute’s ambit, the problem of vagueness is by and large
cured through judicial construction and there is no need to
strike the statute down.
QUESTION a

But I have trouble with

all sawed-off

shotguns beyond all the same length, I have trouble.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

That’s correct.

And it seems to us

14
that if the Court were to say
QUESTION:

I mean, if it was cut off on® inch, you

couldn*t conceal it very well, could you?
MR. EAST?3RBROOK2

If the Court ware to say that

sawed-off shotguns are by and large within the ambit of the
statute, there is still a question for the jury in every case
whether this sawed-off shotgun was in, fact conceatable.

And

that9s a question —
QUESTION:

I thought

we were getting rid of the

can you conceal.
MR. EASTEHBROQKs

No, it goes to the jury in ©very

cas®.
QUESTIONs

You need that,

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

We need it to go to the jury.

Mr. East@rb.rook, I really don't think

that’s what Congress intended.

You go back to Justice Holmes'

holding in that old B6G case on, negligence in the 1920’s that
the courts have to lay down standards of what is or what
isn't negligence, and if you don’t stop at a railroad crossing,
it's negligence per ge.
That was largely rejected by cases that caxm after
that.

It seems to me hare Congress intended that it be up

to the jury to decide under the congressional definition.
don't really think they intended that courts were to define
classes in or out. of the definition.

I

15
MR. EAS TE RB ROOK:

I think that’s correct, and as I

indicated to Mr. Justice Marshall, we think there is a question
for the jury in every single case.
The only point of my argument was that the problem of
vagueness can by and large be eliminated, that is, if the
Court announces that this statute includes sawed-off shotguns
to the extent they are capable of being concealed on the person,
QUESTION:

Hasn’t Congress announced that already?

MR. EAS TE RB ROOK:
QUESTION:

We think it has, and -that5 s why

What would be added by the court doing it?

MR. SASTERBROOK:

Respondent claims that what was

clear to Congress and what is clear to us was not clear to her.
QUESTION;

That may !>© why w@ granted certiorari.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

And we think that can be cleared

up with some ease, actually.
Having set exit the skeleton of our position, X would
like to discuss a nunsher of arguments that respondents make
that border on vagueness arguments, but ‘chat, we submit, aren't
vagueness arguments..
The first of these we have touched on earlier.

And

that’s the argument that the shotgun in this case had a bulky
stock, would have caused a bulge under someone’s coat, and
therefore was not in fact concealable»
the jury and the jury rejected it.

That argument went to

It is, we submit, not a

vagueness argument at all, but simply a question of fact

16
to be adjudicated under the statute.
The second argument is the argument that th© statute
could have been drawn with greater precision and therefore
should have been drawn with greater precision.
is an argument about legislative policy.

This, we think,

The constitutional

question is simply whether the words Congress used are devoid
of meaning.

If Congress uses words of clear purport in at

least some cases, the fact that they could have been clearer
still is immaterial for constitutional purposes.
Third, respondent argues that there is some murky
sona between large and therefore mailable sawed-off shotguns
and small and therefore nonmailable sawed-off shotguns, and
that respondent could not tell where in the son© of uncertainty
her conduct fell.

This is again not a vagueness argument

by and large but an argument for the jury.

To the extent it8s

a vagueness argument at all, it's an argument about vagueness
as applied to particular weapons.

It may well be that there

are some sawed-off shotguns that are so large that even though
th© jury concludas ultimately that they are capable of being
concealed on the person, that it was so uncertain whether the
jury would do so that respondent cannot properly be held
culpable for her conduct.
Now, this Court has indicated that in most ordinary
criminal statutes, a person who approaches a zone of uncertainty
simply takes the risk that hs will cross the line.

That, we

17
submit, is the proper resolution of the vagueness-as-applied
issue in this ca3®.

Respondent approached the son© of

uncertainty and took the risk that, she- would cross the line.

However, it’s not altogether necessary to reach that
question In order to decide this case because the court of
appeals has not yet addressed that argument.
QUESTION:

May 1 ask, ar ®n*t there other statutes

making unavailable various other kinds of firearms and explosives,,
and so on?
MR» EASTERBROOK:

There are statutes making unmailable

destructive devices and explosives fall into the category of
destructive devices«
QUESTIONj

Do they, too, make it a criminal offensa

to mail them?
MR. EASTERBRQOK;
QUESTION %

Yes.

In other words, respondent could have

been charged under those other statutes without any problem,
couldn’t slm?

And if we decided this case against you., all

those other statutes would be available.
MR. EASTEK8ROOK:

I think that’s still possible, your

Honor»
The final argument that respondent has raised is
because the statute doesn’t specifica?».!}/' mention sawed-off
shotguns, it does not reach them,
the term ”other firearms."

it’s too vague because of

Whether "other firearms" is too

18
vague is another question the court of appeals did not reach.
The problem the court of appeals found in th© statute is
whether the phrase "capable of being concealed on the person”
is too vague.

The vagueness problem discerned by the court of

appeals would exist in tills case even if th© statute said
that pistols, revolvers, shotguns, and other firearms capable
of being concealed on the parson shall be nonmailable, because
respondent still could contend that her shotgun was not
capable of being concealed on the person, that the statute was
vague as to her,
Ws think, therefore, that th© argument that the
statute does not specifically mention shotguns is simply not
a vagueness argument within the posture of this case.
In sum, the only problem presented is whether the
phrase "capable of being concealed on -th© parson" is so
devoid of meaning that it cannot ever carry with it a criminal
punishment.

We think that it can and that it can be construed

to be even clearer by this Court, especially perhaps by
reference to the Postal Service regulations which have made it
about as clear as can foe,
W® think this case is governed by what the Court
wrote two terms ago in Latter Carriers.

There are limitations

in the English language with respect, to being both specific
and manageably brief, and it seems to us that although the
prohibitions may not satisfy those intent upon finding fault

19
at any cost, they ara sat out in terms that the ordinary
person exercising ordinary common sons® can sufficiently
understand and comply with.
QUESTION:
questions.

Mr. Easterbrook, a coupla of inconsequential

Dees this record show the offense for which Mr.

Bailey was confined?
MR. BASTERBROOK:

X do not believe that it does,

your Honor.
QUESTION?

Does it show the offense for which Mr»

Powell was confined?
MR. EAS TE RB ROOK:

I do not believe that it does.

X

may be incorrect,
QUESTION*

Am I correct in my impression this

statute has been very seldom used?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

It has been used very seldom.

Most shipments of firearms of this sort cross State boundaries
and so other statutes are available for prosecution.
QUESTION:

If that the reason it was utilised here?

MR, EASTERBROOK:

That was the reason the United

States Attorney selected this statute, your Honor.
QUESTION:

And the only reason, as fax as you know?

MR. EASTERBROOKs

As far as we know

it's the only

reason why this on® was selected.
If there are no further questions, I will reserve
the remainder of my time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Moberg,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY J, MOBERG OH
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, MOBERGs
the Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

I think initially there needs to ba some remarks

addressed to the question of whether or not the respondent is
making a facial attack.

I believe it has been the position

of respondent both at the trial court and at the court of
appeals level that the statute; was vague as applied to her.
And I believe that a careful reading of the opinion of the
Ninth Circuit, a per curiam opinion, and therefor© by definition
being rattier short, does, although not very precisely, set
forth that this statute is vague as it applies to sawed-off
shotguns, and I believe that a fair reading can include in
it as it applies to respondent in this case, and that therefor©
the attack and the question before the Court is not. whether
this is in fact a facial attack of a non-First Amendment
statute, but in fact whether or not this statute, criminal
statute, as applied to the respondent, is unduly vague,
1 think -that as it applies to shotguns of the kind —
and I believe that the only record was that —
QUESTION:
MR, MOBERG:

It does include all shotguns?
I bslieve that the opinion the court

of appeals since it only had the evidence of one shotgun of
a specific dimension was

referring then to that shotgun.

21
QUESTIONS

I thought you said a minute ago all

shotguns.

had.

No.

I would say to the shotgun of that

I believe that’s the only record that the court

Arid I don't believe, then, that the court —
QUESTIONj

If you take that, then you are talking

about a shotgun.
MR. MOBERGs
QUESTIONS

A specific shotgun, which was -Which is a jury question.

MR. MOBERGs

Well, that becomes a question.

It

becomes a jury question if properly submitted to the jury.

If

the statute then is of such certainty that; sawed-off shotguns
would fall within the ambit of that statute. 2t*s respondent's
position that the statute as applied is not of such certainty
that, it would include shotguns and therefore make it a jury
question.

And it was moved at the trial court to determine

as a matter of law that the shotgun was not & concealahla
weapon.

Otherwise, wa get into, I believe, the question that

this Court has expressed sane concern with, is whether or not
»

v« can make a statute become a jury question and whether or
not tii® estimation of the jury will be the deciding factor
in the statute itself.
QUESTION*

Mr. Moberg, didn't — I'm looking at

page 3A of: the Government’s petition • of certiorari where the
court of appeals opinion is set out.

Didn't the court of

22

appsals extend its invalidation to the term "other firearms"
and not just, to sawed-off shotguns?
ME. MOBERGi

l believe that there’s language in there

that could support in a very narrow reading that it. wort Id
apply to other firearms,

I think that unfortunately because

it is a par curiam opinion, that the other language in the
opinion referring to sawed-off shotguns, saying that this
case, at least as applied to sawed-off shotguns, is a case
where the vagueness challenge has been supported, that the
court was meaning to say that considering the record before
the court on appeal and the manner in which the issue was
presented on appeal, that as applied to this shotgun, 'this
statute was vague and that it did not include in its
prescription the mailing of this weapon.
QUESTIONi

What they said on 3K is this t

Having

decided the unconstitutional vagueness of this statuto as it
applied to “other firearms", <m need not reach the other
assignments that are made by appellant,
ME. MOBERG:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

And I

think that they are referring to other firearms in reference to
sawed-off shotguns, that is, as opposed to other firearms in
reference to capability of concealment.
I think the language is unfortunately not precise, bui
I think that tha reason fairly of the opinion is that as to tha
other firearms restriction, as applied to sawed-off shotguns,

23
bscavise the court at one point in the opinion did indicate
parenthetically that their comments were as applied to the
sawed-off shotgun.
QUESTION?

But look at the paragraph above the

paragraph I was just reading from on page 3A of the petition
where it says; ’’To require Congress to delimit the sis© of
the firearms other than pistols and revolvers *a
like they are focusing on that clause in general.

That sounds
And isn’t

that a holding that as applied to other firearms, i.e.,
shotguns# it’s void on its face?
MR. MOBERGs

It would he my reading of the opinion

that it is not that broad of a holding or the court, was
referring# then# principally to the sawed-off shotgun as being
an "other firearm."
I think in

And on -that basis it was vague,.

And then

rather# dicta in this opinion said that this

firearms provision could be rather more precisely drawn.

But

I don’t believe that was necessary to the resolution of the.
case as applied to the appellant at that point# the respondent
in this case.
I believe that at any point, 'that most properly# than#
we have a question in terras of an application of this statute
to a sawed-off shotgun that has been described as 22-1/8 inches
in length# 10-inch barrel# and rather bulky.
I think particularly in the testimony provided by
the St,at® that there was soma testimony by the expert

that# ye3,

24
this weapon could be concealed in a full coat*, but as a matter
of fact# a rifle, a full-sised shotgun, could be concealed
in a full coat and that most any weapon could be concealed on
the person should someone want to conceal it.
So that I don’t believe the testimony was of such -expert opinion that this was a concs&lable item,

.find I think

that the testimony was that almost any weapon is capable of
concealment on the person, which I think-QUESTION:
a case like this?

Would you have needed expert testimony in
Why isn't it something that the jury is as

good a judge of as any expert?
MR. MOBERGs
question,

I would answer the first part of that

ho, you wouldn't need an expert in regard to the

testimony if, in fact, it was properly an issue before the
jury.

That is, if in fact it had been determined that this

item was within the ambit of the statute and therefor® it
became an element of the problem.
QUESTION:

How

is that ordinarily determined?

It’s determined by a ruling of the trial judge, isn’t it, that
there

is sufficient evidence to go to the jury, not by some

expert getting up and testifying.
MR. MOBERG:

That’s correct, except that I think the

ruling of the trial judge in terms of whether there is evidence
and whether or not this weapon is within the ambit of the
statute could be premised partially upon expert testimony as

MR. MOBERG;

At that point through the trial we were

raising the objection that it was not a jury question at all
and therefore not even properly subject to expert testimony/
that clearly the statute did not apply to sawed-off shotguns
and therefor© it was not an element of the crime and that it
wasn't a jury question«
I think in reference to the vagueness argument/
that we need to operate cn a coupIs of premises.

I think that

it does fairly apprise —

but that a stronger argument could bo mad® —
QUESTION t

An 8“inch shotgun would be a shoulder

type weapon?
MR. MOBERG*
QUESTION:
MR. MOBERGs

It is a shoulder class of weapon.
An 8-inch?

How would you shoot?

1 think the testimony was, in fact, that

if you have a sawed-off shotgun, that you need to shoot it
from the shoulder or from the hip, as distinguished from a
pistol because of certain recoil characteristics c£ a sawed-off
shotgun..

So that I don't believe that a broad reading of

that per curiam opinion would be fair in terms of the court’s
decision.

MR. MOBERG:

— to respondent in that particular casa.

And the shotgun which respondent had —
QUESTIONj
MR. MOBERG:

This shotgun.
That’s correct.

And in the bri.efs

the shotgun was described in terms of its length and its
width and arguing that it is not a weapon capable of conceal"
mant, and also that the statute is not of such precis® language
to include that class of sawed-off shotguns, that class of
weapons of that else and bora.

And I think that’s precisely

the issue.
I think that this statute does not provide &
sufficient amount of notice to apprise someone that if you
mail in the mails a sawed-off shotgun that is of 22-1/8 inch
length and as imprecisely as has been attested to is bulky,
that you fall within the prescription of this statuta;.
that if

w©

X think

operate on the premise that, number one, as a

criminal statute, the statute needs to be strictly construed?
and number two, that under the Comi&lly case that it has to
bs a statute drawn to such precision that tmn of common
intelligence could decide clearly that this weapon is within
the ambit of the statute*, then you reach the question of
the certainty of th® statute.
Xt could have led to a double meaning, and 1 think

30

that it gets down to the point ‘that, where, then, 1® the line
drawn?

Is it drawn at 22-1/8 inches?

Is it drawn at 28 inches?

Is it drawn at 1? inches?
QUESTION2

MR# MOBERGs

I believe that could be read into the

That is,

#,

my question went to.

You’re

i

really tailing us that a reasonable snsA could not reasonably

MR. MOBERGs

No, I believe that a reasonable man

would not conclude this weapon concealable under the language
of 'this statute, because this statute refer» to pistols,

31
revolvers, and other weapons capable of concealment*

I think

that*s —
QUESTION*

He know this wasn’t a pistol and he

knew it wasn’t a revolver, therefore it was an other weapon,
was it not?
MR, MOSEROs

It may be, except. I think at that point

in determining the other firearms —
QUESTION *
MR* MOBERGs

But what else is it but an other firearm?
It is an other firearm, but not all other

firearms are within the prescription of the statute*

Then

it’s a question is it. an other firearm capable of concealment
on the person*

And I think that at that point, if we do in

fact determina the statute and its meaning to the man of
cosaaon intelligence, according to any principle of construction,
clearly this statute, wasn’t meant to apply to sawed-off
shotguns *
QUESTION*

That’s a statutory argument, not a

eons titutlona1 on® *

ME, MOBKRGa

That’s correct, and I think it Is

entwined with the argument that petitioner raises in terms of
the constitutionality of the statute*

In determining its

vagueness, I think that we need to look at the construction
of the statute as on® of the principles in determining whether
or net it Is certain and that it is certain a» applied to
sawed-off shotguns,

And I believe that this statute interpreted

32
with any kind of statutory construction would lend support to
the argument that it does not apply to sawed-off shotguns,
It is not drawn with language so that it would apply to
sawed-off shotguns.
QUESTION:

But the Ninth Circuit didn’t go on that

ground,
MR* MOBERG:

No, 'the Ninth Circuit did not, in its

opinion# reach the construction argument*
QUESTION:

Isn’t 'that kind of strange that they

didn’t reach the construction argument because; they went right
to the constitutional point?
mr„,

it as strange*

MOBERGs

I don’t know if I would characterize

1 may characteris® it as unfortunate, because

X believe there is a construction argument there that probably
under the leadership of this Court, it has been clear in
U»5» v* Harrlss that if the statute can be construed in a
constitutional manner, then it should be, and that this statute
in fact, and part of the argument raised before this Court
is that this statute in fact can foe construed in a constitutional
manner, but that construction would, not admit to the inclusion
of the kind of weapon as before the Court in this case.
QUESTIONt

Would you object to right now just

vacating the judgment below and sanding it back to face the
statutory question at the outset?
MR. MOBERGs

Well, I think I would object on the terms

33

that it is not a clear question that the statuta as applied
is so certain that it applies to sawed-off shotguns»

I think

that if this Court decided that there is a question or an
issue of vagueness and there is a question of vagueness of fch©
statute as applied to tills case? to save that statute from
its constitutional challenge as being vague, that the Court
may, and in fact I think the Court must, at least as I read
Harries, then interpret the statute so that it can avoid the
vagueness issue-

And 1 think there’s little doubt that there

must be soma question as to the certainty of that statute; by
the vary fact that we have the court of appeals wondering and
in fact ruling that the statuta does not cover sawed-off
shotguns»
I think in a similar case in Colorado,, Cokley v.
People, which is on page 7 in my brief, in a similar statute
they concluded that firearms, other firearms provision in a
statute that referred to pistols, revolvers, knives, and
billy clubs, the other firearms provision was not within the
ambit of that statute.
So I think there is a considerable question as to
what application the statute has.

I think that application

issue goes to the issue of whether or not the language is
certain enough to advise a man of common intelligence that
the mailing of a sawed-off shotgun, 22-1/8 inches, is in fact
in violation of this statute, especially if you look at the

34
history of the statute ip. the first Instance.

Because 1

believe the history of the statute in the first instance was
that it was to control the mailing of pistols and revolvers,
of handguns by mail order people.

X think clearly in that

history it refers to the Sears & Roebuck mailing of handguns
and

..<■

the loss of the control of the States in a mail

ordez sifcv&tion*
This statute was not meant, X do not believe from
its history, from its .moaning, and from its interpretation, to
be a statute to prosecute on© who mails a single sawed-off
shotgun in the mail.
QUESTION?

What is the us® of a sawed-off shotgun?

MR. MDBERG*

Wall,, X think there arc various uses.

Number one, I think sawed-off shotguns are — there» &r® dealersi
in sawed-off shotguns.
QUESTION?

Yes, but when you get out into the field,

what use is mad© of it?
MR. MCSERGs

Well, sawed-off shotguns provide a

less restrictive choke, on the expulsion of the pellets from
the shotgun and gives it a wider stream.
QUESTIONt

Yes, I know,

what do people us© them for

as a result of that less restrictive choke?
MR. MOBERG?

Well, in terms of what people use them

for, I don't knew, because I think that8s a rather general
question

35
QUESTIONi

They are used to shoot people with.

ME. MOBSEG s

They may be used to shoot people# they

may be used to shoot —
QUESTIOH:
MR, MQBERG?,
QUESTION?
MR. MQBERG:

Isn't that the only us© for them?
1 would not admit to that# no,
Do you know of any other use for them?
I believe that you could use them in

hunting birds# for example.
QUESTION s

Would you over pick a shotgun with &

10-inch barrel ns opposed to a shotgun with a 2-1/2 foot
barrel to shoot birds with.?
MR. MQBERG:

1 think you * d have a considerable

problem# as Mr. Justice raises# at great lengths.

But. I'm

not willing to admit that that is th® only purpose for reducing
the sir® of a barrel„
QUESTION:

If we gat th® bird up at two feet that

means you can use & sawed-off shotgun.
MR, MQBERG %

If th® barrel is only sawed off 2 inches

or 3 inches# then I think that your range is in proportion
to the reduction sis© of the barrel,
QUESTION:

Mr* Moberg, a couple of questions# just

leafing through th® record.

Did Mrs. Powell persist in

denying that she ever mailed this?
MR* MOBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes# she did.
And am 1 correct in my impression that

36
she said she purchased it for her self-protection at home?
MR. MOBERG:

She purchased a rifle# a shotgun# for

her protection.

That shotgun was not the shotgun# I believe#

as I recall it.

There were two shotguns involved.

The full-

length shotgun that they did attribute to her purchasing was
not the shotgun that's the

subject °f this appeal# the on®

that she testified she purchased and was in her closet.
QUESTION 5

Then# is it as to the other one that she

conceded she naver assembled it?
MR. MOBERG:

As to trxe sawed-off shotgun# she testifies

that she never purchased the weapon that wen subsequently
reduced to a sawed-off shotgun and that the only weapon that
she purchased was in fact the full-length shotgun which was#
in fact# produced at trial.
QUESTION:

Isn't there soma testimony on her part

that she put it in the closet and never assembled it?
MR. MOBERG:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Why wouldn’t she# if she purchased a

shotgun for self-protection?
MR. MOBERG:

Well# I think at that point# as I

recall the evidence# her testimony was that ah© put it in there
and she just simply — she was not familiar with weapons to
start with# and she did not in fact know hew to assemble or
clean the weapon, and she placed it, than, in the closet with
th@ idea of then sometime putting it together, and forgetting

37
about it®

And there wasnet a long period of time between the

purchase, I think, and the subsequent interrogation by the
postal authorities.
QUESTION;

So she bought it for her protection but

she didn't do what was necessary for her protection.
MR. MOBERG:

'Hint's correct, from the record.

And I would hasten to point out that that is not the shotgun
that is the subject matter of this appeal,
QUESTION 3

That may have had something to do with

the jury's assessment of her credibility, X supposa.
MR, MOBERGs

Oh, very much so.

2 guess that's not

an issue before this Court or was before the court of appeals
in terns of her credibility, and not on® that I could
properly raise because 2 believe that that is truly within
th® ambit of the jury to decide whether or not she in fact
purchased the weapon.
But I think that the question it corns back to, in
‘terms ©f its interpretation, in terms of th© statute’s meaning,
is does th® statute, number on®, give the notice, and does
it, too, number one, provide the prot@cf.ion against an
arbitrary law enforcement?
Connally.

I think that that second part of this

test,and th© same test was raised in Lansetta,

is even evident in this case.

Because I think that at the

point, and I can only surmise the reasons that the prosecutor
decided to prosecute under this seldom-used statuta, ona that

38

is to control mail order,, is that the prosecutor did not
feel that he had a sufficiant casa for other possible crimes
that he could have charged — and I think as one of the
Justices pointed out — could have charged this defendant with,
And by the very fact of the broadness of the statute# then#
the prosecutor had open to him a catch-all statute.

Ha said#

1 don't — and 1 think this is a fair supposition

I don't

have fch® evidence to convict her on seme other crime# but 1
can charge her on this mailing crime.

And 1 think clearly it

is inconsistent with the statute itself that this charge
should have even been brought as a mailing violation under
this statute.
There are statutes in, terms of possession that are
very clearly defined in sawed-off shotguns# there are statutes
X believe that could have been brought.

I think that X

raise this point only to show that this statute doas in its
rather vagus language permit an arbitrary enforcement of the
statute itself.

Because there is no discernible standard.

QUESTIONS

Let

us assume that someone disagrees

with you and holds that the statute is perfectly clear insofar
as sawed-off shotguns# just as clear as it is with pistols.
You don't agree with that# but let's assume that someone decides
that’s the way it is.

On that assumption there is no

discretion at, all on the prosecutor except just don't bring
a case# but that's true of any statute.

X mean# it certainly

39

isn’t giving hira any rang® of discretion he wouldn’t have under
ciny criminal statute if it's clear that the statute covers
this weapon»
MR. MOBERGj

I believe that his disc-ration is reduced

except that the statute as written, I think in its entirety,
is a statute to control mail order shipment of pistols and
revolvers and maybe mail order shipment of sawed-off shotguns.
And that is not the purpose of the statute to prosecute an
individual mailing of that kind of an item.

So that I don’t

think that at least practically that is the purpose or has
been the use of the statuta»
QUESTIONs
MR. MOBERG:

That’s not a vagueness argument,
No.

And the prosecutor can very well

bring it if w© assume for the sake of argument that it clearly
applies to sawed-off shotguns.

He would be very well within

his rights to bring this case» under the statute..

But X

believe the fact that he did. under this statute as it
presently is written points out to the arbitrariness, really,
in the enforcement of this statute, and that it was not meant
under its history or its interpretation to bring up a
conviction in this kind of e. case,
X say that only as a support, of the vagueness argument.
X think that the other thing the Court needs to
concern itself with is the construction of the statute»

X

believe that under the Harriss case that this Court may and
h .

40
should# than# if it determines that the statutory language
is not so overly broad or not so vague that nan of common
intelligence could not choose their path in the conduct that's
prescribed, could sav© that challenge of this statute by
a fair construction of fch® statute, based, number one, on its
language — pistols and revolvers and other firearms capable
of concealment on the person,

I think that the statutory

construction is that pistols and revolvers will modify the
general language in the statute and the general language will
be then presumed to foe of the same class as the pistols and
revolvers.

Pistols and revolvers are in the class of handguns#

and it would seem to me that clearly under that 'theory of
statutory construction, this is a statute to--control the unlawful
mailing of handguns.
I think that the history of the statute in the
Congressional Record —
QUESTIONS

Have you got any proof that a sawed-off

shotgun can't be fired in one hand?
MR. MOBSEG;

Only the testimony of the Tobacco

arid Firearms mart that because of the recoil characteristics,
it would not be a weapon that you could fire arm extended.
QUESTION3
MR. MOBERGs

You couldn4fc,
Could not, because of the recoil

characteristics -that are not the same characteristics of a
pistol

41
QUESTION:

But you can fira it with, on® hand?

MR, MOBERG;

It can be fired with one hand against

the shoulder or against the hip.
QUESTIONS

That’s right, they can. be fired with one

hand.
MR, MOBERGs

I would resume they could be fired with

on© hand.
QUESTION;

That makes it a handgun*

What are' you

going to do with that?
MR. MOBERG:

Well, I think the distinction between

handgun and shoulder-type weapon is not that it can — all
guns are fired with the hand or hands, can be hand or hands
guns, but I think that the distinction is that a handgun
characteristiosll.y can be fired with one hand away from the
body, where a shoulder type of weapon needs to rest against
th® body itself,

tod whether the structure would be the

shoulder or the hip, it needs to rest against the shoulder
or the hip.

I think that’s the distinction, not whether one

uses a hand to manipulate the trigger, because all guns are
fired in that way.

Pistols and revolvers, first, 1 think,

sat up the class in terms of sis®, and I think, that they also
sat up the class in terms of characteristics.
QUESTION;

The difference between a handgun and a

shoulder gun, that’s the basic difference,

tod a sawed-off

shotgun one© it's sawed off, is not a typical

shoulder gun.

42
MR. MQBERG:

I would say it is not a typical shoulder

gun* but that it is —
QUESTIONs
MR. MOBERG;

That's why you saw it, off,
Again, the question why it's sawed off

for the ultimate purpose, I don't think is one that wa can
give speculation to.

1 think fch® question and fch© argument

I am raising is that pistols and: revolvers define not only
the class and. that handgun as opposed to shoulder, but also
define

fch® size, and that under either of those classes, this

statute refers to pistols and revolvers.

And I think that it

is not unreasonable and men of conation intelligence quite
readily may assume that there are not pistols and revolvers
of th® 22-1/8

inches in size with a barrel of 10 inches.

And

I think they are not of a bulky nature.
So I would say at this point it seems, and it is
a construction argument in fch© sense that if the statute can
be

saved from its vagueness, then it must be saved by

construction.

But «van further, that construction argument

points to fch© problem in tin® statute in terms of its certainty,
because from the construction analysis of the statute, it
does not apply to sawed-off shotguns.

It does not. govern a

weapon of that sis® or the kind of crime that was charged.
And X would think that, other firearms capable of being
concealed is not any more definable, it's symbolic language
that has an outward reference point and that outward reference

43
point is not clear.

I don't think it is any more ciear than

the current rate per diem in the Connelly case.
So I would say in conclusion, then, that this
statute is unduly vague and that it can be saved, X believe,
by this Court, from its vagueness challenge by construction
limiting it to pistols and revolvers and pistol-type weapons.
Thank you.
