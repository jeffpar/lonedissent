MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

Mr. Christy, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER W. CHRISTY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. CHRISTY*

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court*
The instant case presents a challenge to a Mississippi
statute governing the sale of milk in Mississippi by out-ofState processors and producers.
My client, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company,
operates a processing, milk processing plant, in the State of
Louisiana, at which it processes milk for its stores in
Louisiana and Mississippi.

A£P also operates approximately

38 stores in the State of Mississippi.
from Mississippi

ASP sought a permit

» or certification from Mississippi for the

right to sell its milk at its stores in Mississippi,
The permit was refused on the basis that the statute
in question requires that a certificate be attached to the
application, certifying that the State, in this case Louisiana,
would give reciprocity to Mississippi's inspections of its
milk.
Basically, the statute says, Your Honors, that
Mississippi will allow an oufc-of-State processor to sell its

4
milk in Mississippi if that company — if the State which
inspects that company's milk has standards and procedures that
are substantially equivalent to those of Mississippi, and if
the milk receives at least a 90 percent rating under the
public — under an inspection administered by the Public health
Service-certified officer.
It further provides — and this is the portion of the
statute which we claim to be unconstitutional — that the milk
would be accepted only if the sending State giv©3 reciprocity
to Mississippi's inspections, and accepts its standards also.
QUESTION:

Mr. Christy, are you attacking the entire

Mississippi regulation, or just Section 11 of it?
MR. CHRISTY:

Well, Your Honor, just that Section 11

is the only section that deals with out-of-State processors,
which is the -- well, in answer to your question, only Section
11, only part of Section 11, the part that requires that the
processor obtain a reciprocity agreement from the State in
which its plant is located.
QUESTION:

I think the rest of it isn't for us, is

it, it's —
MR. CHRISTY:
QUESTION:

It's only Section 11 —
-- I don’t find it even in the record or

in your brief, or anylfcing? it’s just Section 11.
MR. CHRISTY:
Honors.

It's &feirly confined issue, Your

We feel that the statute in question is clearly a

5
burden on interstate commerce, and should be stricken for that
reason.
After the permit was denied, A&P filed suit in
Mississippi in a single-judge court, and asked for a temporary
restraining order. This was denied.

The company was given leave

to amend, to ask for a three-judge court.

The outcome of this

eventually was that the three-judge court denied relief, and
this appeal followed.
Your Honors, Mississippi defends its statute by
claiming that its reciprocity requirement is helath-related
and is not economic in nature.

And it seeks to avoid the

rulings, the vast number of rulings by this Court, striking
down similar statutes governing regulation of milk, the sale
of milk, in which economic ptsrposes were found.
V7e feel that logic shows that the statute, or at
least the reciprocity provision, can only be economic in
nature.

Mississippi says, Well, if we get reciprocity from

Louisiana, than we will accept their milk, even though their
standards are lower, if they will accept our milk.
Well, if they accept it on the basis of —

first.
MR. CHRISTY:

There’s no question in this css®.

It's been stipulated that but for the reciprocity agreement

6

A&P's milk would be acceptable,.

And that Louisiana's standards

are substantially equivalent to Mississippi's.
QUESTION: But you don't contest those provisions?
MR. CHRISTY:

No, sir.

Only the reciprocity pro­

vision.
My point, I was making, was that reciprocity has
nothing to do with wholesomeness, because if the

reciprocity

statement is signed and submitted, then a permit is given
and they will accept milk of a less wholesome nature.
*

Now, their —
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that it's nothing

but a rule for administrative convenience?
MR. CHRISTY:

I suggest, Your Honor, that the

statute in quei3tion is ah economic measure passed by
Mississippi to insure that its processors have an available
market, before it lets in foreign competition.
Also I think the record reflects that one of the
purposes of the statute was

ec

that Mississippi would not have

to expand the cost for out-of-State inspection.

Mr. Cottrell,

the defendant, testified to that effect.
Further, along this line, Your Honors, —
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't insist that, if they

wanted to inspect, that they would have to pay the cost, you
would pay the cost?
MR. CHRISTY:

That was the basis — well, I don't

7
think that question is before the Court.

I realise that that

could be an alternative —
QUESTION: But no one has ever suggested that it would
burden interstate commerce to — for the State to spread the
cost of inspection among those whom it inspects?
MR. CHRISTY:

I was going to point. Your Honor, that

Dixie Dairy —
QUESTION:

Inside or outside the State.

MR. CHRISTY:

The Dixie Dairy case, which is cited by

Mississippi, and was also relied on by the three-judge court
that denied relief.

This was a three-judge court in the

Seventh Circuit, which held that the City of Chicago had the
right to require out-of-State inspections of Indiana milk?
that this was not a burden.
Well, Your Honors, that, case was overruled by the
Seventh Circuit and remanded to the District. Court, and the
District Court has since ruled that Chicago’s requirement of
its own inspections is ?. burden on interstate commerce, inasmuch
5.3

Indiana’s inspections are sufficient to insure wholesome

milk.
So what I'm saying is that if that is — and that's
now before the Seventh Circuit —
QUESTION: But you don't need to take that on here.

MR. CHRISTY:
that.

I don’t believe that this case requires

I think that the cases that this Court has decided in

8
the area of milk,regulation of milk by the States, made clear
that a State cannot erect an economic barrier agai.nst foreign
competition in consequence of its own local producers.
Efurthermore, if — and we recognize that milk, and
these cases have recognized that the regulation of milk is in
the State interest and that it's a matter of local concern.

But

if there is a regulation that burdens commerce, and there are
alternative means available, which would be less of a burden,
then the regulation roust fall.
The Dean Milk case

mentioned that.

There’s no question her® that if the reciprocity
requirement is not economically -- is not related to the health,
then they don't need it.

There's no reason for it.

statute could stand without that requirement.

The

And Mississippi

would get just as wholesome milk as it would with it.
And along these lines, the record reflects that four
dairies in Louisiana, four processors in Louisiana are at this
time, and havs been, exporting milk to Mississippi without a
reciprocity agreement.
Now, Mississippi has been unable to explain why they
allow four processors to do this, but they won't allow A6P to
do it.
And this goes to the second part of our argument, that
bearing on the equal protection point.

But I think it

illustrates, also, that the reciprocity has absolutely nothing

9
to do with wholesomaness of the milk.
Your Honor, Mississippi also claims that their
statute survives the constitutional attack because they have a
safety valve built in there.

The safety valve they claim is

that the statute provides that the governing authority car;
inspect the milk and see if it meets domestic standards.
So that if we don't have a reciprocity agreement, we can still
get into Mississippi with our milk by meeting their domestic
standards.
But, in. a .footnote in their brief, they admit that
they have no means sat up for any type of inspection at all.
So, w© submit, that if the statute doss allow for my client to
get in vrith an out-of-State inspection, it’s being applied in
an unconstitutional mariner, because no basis or no procedure
has been established to allow this.
Mississippi — I think the brief indicates that the
main thrust of their argument is that Mississippi is not to blame;
Louisiana is to blame.

"Don't coma to us and ask to get your

milk in? go to Louisiana and make them give you a reciprocity
agreement."
Well, Your Honors, A&P is not Louisiana.

We can't

force Louisiana to enact legislation.
V•

QUESTION:

With whom is the agreement when there is

one?
MR. CHRISTY:

It is a statement — when you apply for

10

a certification, the health officer from Mississippi sends you
a form stating the requirements.

One of the requirements is a

form attached to that, which has a place to fill in, the name
of the other State’s governing authority, health authority, and
they have to sign it, stating that —
QUESTION: That authority has to sign it?
MRo CHRISTY: That authority has to sign it.
And of course, Louisiana —
QUESTION:

There is no other way of complying with

the requirement?
MR. CHRISTY: There has been none.

And Louisiana's

position —
QUESTION:

You haw to place the requirement.

MR. CHRISTY:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Now, —

You think we have to get the Louisiana

authorities to sign that fom.
MR. CHRISTY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

In the form that it*s printed by

Mississippi?
MR. CHRISTY: And this we have bean unable to do.
Louisiana’s position is:

w© don't —• we’re not going to sign a

reciprocity agreement; we'll let anybody’s milk come into our
State if it meets our standards *
And Louisiana doss conduct out~o£~State inspections.
QUESTION:

Louisiana, doss not have a reciprocity

11
agreement with any other State, does it?
MR. CHRISTY:

No, sir.

QUESTION: And there's no statutory authorization for
it?
MR. CHRISTY: There is, I believe, the regulations
under which Louisiana operates, give the authorities the
discretion to enter into a reciprocity agreement if they want
to; but they have never done this.
QUESTION: Does the record show why not?

If they have

the authority to do it.
MR. CHRISTY: The record contains copies of all the
various statutes and regulations, but I don't believe there's
any explanation of why they have never entered into a — we
have a — well, Your Honors, there is a letter from the Chief
Health Officer in Louisiana, explaining the position of
Louisiana.

And that is basically what I said, that we don't ;

believe reciprocity is necessary; we let anybody's milk come in
if it insets our standards.
And that has been their position, and that's as far
as they will go.
But Mississippi would not accept this, and refuses to
issue the permit.
As I mentioned, we believe, although our principal
argument is aimed at. the commerce clause question, that the
record reflects that AfiP has been denied equal protection of

12
th© law.

Mississippi responds to this by saying: Well, you

hav© brought oat the regulations under which these four dairies
were allowed to continue to do business in Mississippi without
reciprocity.

I believe the record shows th© only regulation in
effect is Section 11.

And if Mississippi applies Section 11

by allowing four processors to do business without reciprocity,
while not allowing A£P to do business without reciprocity,
then I believe that's a clear denial of equal protection as
the statute is applied.
QUESTION:

The justification, as I understood it,

at least, on the part of the State is that these four others
ere permitted to do business under — by virtue of a grandfather provision, that they were doing business at the time
this naw lav? cerae into effect,
MR. CHRISTY: That’s whet I -'understand, and —
QUESTION:

And that you presumably were not.

MR. CHRISTY: And the State — and the claim is made
that we should have attacked the grandfather provision.
Well, frankly, nobody seams to know — nobody know’s
>
about any grandfather — the record doesn’t contain a mention
of any provision; there’s been none brought to anybody’s
attention.

.And, frankly, 2 don't knew of whet grandfather

provision counsel is referring to; and I don’t believe counsel
does.

13

We’re talking about Section 11.

If there’s another

law that says these dairies cm corns in without complying with
the law, it was never brought to anybody’s attention*
QUESTION:

la it a fact that these dairies wars

doing business in the State, ~«
KRo CHRISTY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— at the time of the enactment of the

law, and that you were not.
MR. CHRISTY:

Yes, that’s correct.

Thay were doing

business before '67, and A£P began operations about 1972.
QUESTION:

Unh~hurJ j.

MR. CHRISTY:

I ‘might add that A&P is sustaining a

considerable lose of revenue as a result of Mississippi’s
recalcitrance, just in ths cost of buying miIk in Mississippi
for its stores, as opposad to the price, the cost it could
process the milk for itself,has bean estimated at approximately
$1S5,000 a year.
Ana of course this is not the only damages they are
suffering.
I would like to save a little time for rebuttal.
Your Honor.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF 1IE5SR LADNER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. LADNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court:
I am Heber Ladner, Jr., Special Counsel for Dr.
Cottrell, in this matter.
Section 11 of our regulation is & part of the
solution and not a part of the problem to the interchange of
milk between the several States.
In the first place, this regulation has created wideranging commerce.
in nine States.

It has brought in milk from sixteen dairies
It has worked, in short, uncter the commerce

clausa.
Second, unlike the, Baldwin vs. Seelig line of casas,

in this Court, this regulation, does not favor local producers,
it insures merely parity of local producers.

That is to say,

the reciprocity provision dose have tesfch, but it allows
Mississippi producers to have access to the markets from which
imported milk cereas,
QUESTION: Bub you dc. not suggest that this milk
doesn’t meet th© health standards?
MR. LADNER:

I'm saying that ones a certificate of

reciprocity is not forthcoming, substantial compliance with
Section 11 is impossible, and that an oui^of-State producor
is then thrown back —

15
QUESTION:

So you don't say this milk ig not meeting

— dosen't meet the health standards?
MR. LADNER: We do say that it fails to meet the
health standards*
QUESTION: Because of ths. reciprocity provision?

MR. LADNER: Well, because of the standards applicable
to domestic producers, absent reciprocity, in everything that
Section 11 entails, than an out~of*~Stato producar is thrown
back upon the domestic standards? much a3 ths State of
Louisiana says it utilizes domestic standards*
But Mississippi does not at present conduct out~ofState inspections, because it adopted Section 11 to obviate
that responsibility.
In other words, wa say our constitutional responsibil­
ity was fulfilled by agreeing to let out-»of-State milk come in
vpon a reduced standard of sanitation if, by the same token,
Mississippi milk can move.
How, that's the result of the regulation.

The

methodology of the regulation is to simply exchange standards
of inspection.

one

We say there is a health-related purpose in

State agreeing that a sister Stata conducts credible health

investigations *
QUESTION:

Of course, it*s possible that Louisiana's

standards may be higher than Missis sippi* s, is it not?

MR. LADNER:

Your Honor, on this record, I would think

16
not.

We made the assertion in our brief, and the trial court

made the assertion much as a finding of fact, that Mississippi
standards exceed Louisiana's.

And I find that unchallenged in

the appellant's brief.
We say that the regulation eervas a health-related
purpose because it gains out-of-State assistance in inspecting
milk, and it ascertains a reasonably reliable interstate
standard.
QUESTION:

But is the position of Mississippi here

so much, different than that of the City of Madison in the
Dean Milk case?

There, too, Madison said, "Ws'ra just not

going to make out-of-State inspections."
Now, you have, in addition to that policy, your
reciprocity provision. But you pretty well have to defend the
reciprocity provision, don't you?
MR. LADNER*

Yac, Hr. Justice Rehnquisb, we do.

But

we say that wa'r© not isolating oursGives because of the fact
that the Section 11 reciprocity policy has worked.
produced.

It's

We are in the strange position of having complied

with the commerce clause of the Constitution and, in the same
breath, v?a'rs charged with not complying with it.

We've used

one of those reasonably nondie criminatory alternatives.

We

decided we didn't want to make out-of**Stats inspections, and.
LO( instead, we adopted a policy of reciprocity.

It is compulsory.

But it doss work.

17
Now, I think this Court's cases on the interstate
commarce clavis a foaus upon the whole thrust of interstate
commerce, and not just one State vis-a-vis another.
QUESTION * But is the only goal of the interstate
commerce clause to make sura that Mississippi has enough railk
coming to suit its needs, or isn't it also to give the Louisiana,
producers the right to send railk into Mississippi if there are
no health objections to it?
MR, LADNER* Well, we think it's somewhat broader than
just giving Louisiana processors the right to corns in.

It is

a substantial but incidental burden on Louisiana processors,
who aro not in compliance with Section 11. But we think the
interstate commerce clause is broader than just Mississippi
processors’ rights or Louisiana processors * rights.
QUESTION: But it’s not just a minor burden on them.
They simply can’t do anything, as I understand it;

Louisiana

processors that want to ship stalk into Mississippi*
MR, LADNER* Wall, wc? say to that, that the State of
Louisiana has the power to execute a reciprocity agreement.
QUESTION* But, as ycur opponent points out, A£P isn’t
the State of Louisiana.
KR, LADDER*

That's correct.

But we think that

presently soma litigation in the Louisiana Stato courts, that's
coma up sines this case, we frankly question why Louisiana was
not sued, first.

Why U3?

18

In other words, there is a duty on the part of the
Louisiana official to enter into reciprocity agresiaents.

It's

in the original record, it’s paragraph 5.6.1. of the Louisiana
regulations.
QUESTION: Who do you sue in Louisiana?

The

Lsgislature?

Mlio LADNER:

The State Health Officer, for failing

to carry out his duty undor paragraph 5.6.1.
QUESTION:

Now, how do you work out this ’’duty” on

the part of Louisiana to reciprocate?
MR. LADNER:

Well, I sey that the State — the

Louisiana regulations read at: follows:

"The State Health

Officer*1 —

Thank you.
"The State Health Officer may accept

representative, agent, or agency of such other State wherein
such products are produced."
And vat —
QUESTION:
sue Louisiana?

Why shouldn't the Mississippi producer

He has ths same constitutional rights to free

flow of products among the States*
MR. LADNER:

Perhaps one should*

One hasn't*

Mr.

19

?
Swegman, a wall-known, perhaps nationally known — I think Mr.
Swegman helped bust the Fair Trade Law several years ago, and
he’s at it again on the milk regulations? and he has obtained
an injunction in Louisiana State court.

He and a Mississippi

producer, his co-plaintiff, have enjoined Louisiana from
refusing to accept Mississippi’s milk.
QUESTION?

If Mississippi's health standards and

the production of milk in Mississippi ar© comparable to
Louisiana's, Louisiana probably can't keep them out, can they?
MR. LADNER: Well, that Court ruled that Mississippi
milk could not be kept out, but significantly, under the
proviso that Mississippi milk must meet the Louisiana standards
to coma in.
QUESTION;

v.’all, you don’t object to that, do you?

MR, LADNER:

No, I don't.

I*d say that would be

the result of this case if Section 11 were enjoined, I think
we would be. thrown right back to where ws were before.
There’s been no challenge in this cas® that our
health regulations for domestic producers are arbitrary or
capricious or violite the commerce clause.

And of course there

might be some ques-.ion as to how far Section 11 falls, or what
parts of it fall? hut we would say it would be a sort of a
status quo anti situation if our reciprocity

provision were

enjoined.
In effeci, you'd have, almost admittedly you'd have

20

A&P's products# which do not meet our domestic standard# simply
up against our domestic standard.
So# Section 11 is productive.
QUESTION: Well# you could turn them down on the basis
of their failure to meet your domestic standards# then#
couldn't you?
MR. LADNER:

Yes# Your Honor, we could.

>Ws could.

QUESTION: Well# why don't you# then?
MR. LADNER:

Well# I couldn't speak for the

administrative officials I represent, but that possibility
could be confronted later; but we say this regulation is wiser
end more productive for interstate commerce through all the
States than having these picayune problems of how meny square
feet of floor space is in the milk parlor# or what the
temperature cf the milk is when it goes to the cooling truck.
We adopted this regulation to try to avoid those
hurdles# and it's — But, at any rate, to get back to Mr.
Justice Rehnquist's inquiry, what is the thrust of the commerce
clause in a case of this import; do you just look at the two
parties or do you look at all commarce coming through?
Now# we think there's authority in this Court's books
in Polar lea Cream vs. Andrews# a Florida case# wherein the
local processors wars required to buy all of the output of
local producers at a certain price.

And Florida cams to this

Court and argued that# wall, in effect# we have competition on

21
the distributor level, milk comes from all over.
This Court, in a footnote, analyzed that contention
and said, Well, Florida, of all the Southeastern States, has
the least volume of interstate movement in milk at the
distributor level.
Well, we*have a high volume.

Proof shows that this

regulation has produced a high volume of interstate trade in
milk; is not the kind of historic commerce clause case where a
State is favoring its local producers or its lo-al economy.
Ml this regulation does is obtain them parity.

It says, in

affect, Mississippi-produced milk, under substantially
equivalent regulations, can go wherever milk can come to
Mississippi from.
And that’s the result under Section 11.
Second, I’ve explained soma ways in which this
reciprocity regulation is health**related, but it also has
other legitimate State interests behind it.

As I’ve said

before, it achieves parity for local producers.

And there's

an economic justification for the regulation, in that it holds
down the price of milk.
QUESTION:

Regulation —
When you say that it achieves parity,

you raear for the Mississippi producer, th© processors and
producers?
MR. LADNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
In your view, is that a permissible factor

22
under the commerce clause?

I think it is, Your Honor.

MR. LADNER:

I think this

Court’s cases outlaw only favoritism, but not parity.
Nov7, there is an aspect in which Mississippi
processors are disadvantaged under our Section 11.

That is,

their standard for sanitation and health and other inspection
requirements are higher than those of the State of Louisiana.
Now, I do not know whether that results in increased
production costs, but at least Louisiana would be bringing in
milk under Section 11 if the State complied at a relaxed
standard.
Now, why doesn’t Louisiana comply?

We think it's

relevant to this case, a court of equity to look at all of the
facts in this case, including the fact that Louisiana stubbornly
refuses to enter into reciprocity with any State.

Mr. Ladner, what would be the basis of that

Why does Louisiana have a duty to reciprocate?
MR. LADNER:

Well, Your Honor, I spoke about duties

earlier, and I was leading myself several steps down the way.
They have a discretionary duty under this statute to enter into
reciprocity agreements.

W® think it cannot be said that the

23
statute is there for no good purpose.

They have the discretion.

They cannot exercise the discretion capriciously or in a fashior,
that's at war with the commerce clause; and we say they are.
They're failing to accept out-of-State milk, not just from
Mississippi but from everywhere.
QUESTION: Well# aren't they a sovereign State?
MR. LADNER:

Well# I suppose that# as much as that

concept has meaning, they are; but I'm just simply Eaying that
they're exceeding the bounds of their discretion in not con­
sidering reciprocity when that position disadvantages out-ofState producers for commerce clause reasons.

They're acting

unconstitutionally, acting beyond the bounds of their discretion
under the commerce clause.
Louisiana has the trade barrier in this case, and
Mississippi has the solution; yet Mississippi is sued in this
case, and we're here worrying about whether a regulation, in
effect# works and produces the widest possible scope of
commerce.
QUESTION:

But you're not saying that Mississippi

doesn’t have the solution# either# are you?
MR. LADNER: Well# they would have the solution if

QUESTION:

You think Mr. Swegman should have won

his case in Louisiana?

Based on the Constitution.

24

MR. LADNER:

I think that he probably should have.

Your Honor.
QUESTION: Because Louisiana must, tinder the
Constitution, accapt clean milk from other States.
MR. LADNER: With the distinction that Louisiana is
not enjoying an intercourse in milk from all other States.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but that would be the grounds
that Swegmen would win on, isn’t it?
MR. LADNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes, sir, it would.
And Mississippi is subject to that same

requirement,
MR. LADNER:

That’s correct.

But once again, he

won empiric victory.
QUESTION:

There is reciprocity under the Constitu­

tion.
MR. LADNER:

I take it the Interstate Commerce Clause

is constitutional reciprocity.
QUESTION:
MR. LADNER:

It works both ways, in other words.
Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Wall, what if Louisiana’s position is that
the milk approved by Mississippi inspectors is just not
sufficiently healthy compared to what we demand in Louisiana,
end therefore we’re not going to let it in?
MR, LADNER: Well, that was their position, and the
Court said that — the State Court in Louisiana said that in

25
order for Mississippi milk to come in, it must meat Louisiana's
health requirements.
QUESTION;

Now, that's certainly not a violation of

the commerce clause, is it?
MR. LADNER:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Nor

would it be a violation of the commerce clause for Mississippi
to exact those same standards from Louisiana, absent Section 11.
So ASP could win the battle and lose the war, if it
succeeded in having this Court enjoin Section 11.

Because the

record contains indications that Mississippi standards exceed
those of the State of Louisiana.
And of course no one ha3 spoken about the cost of
©ut-of**State inspections necessary to verify the quality of
Louisiana milk.

That might bring about a price differential

in its own way.
SO
QUESTION:

But A&P is an old hand at assessing

those costs, I take it; it's teen marketing milk for a long
time.
MR. LADNER:

Well, that's correct, Your Honor.

It's

presently having milk processed by Mississippi producers under
its own label, and marketing them at a less advantageous
profit ratio than it would like.

I have a hard time

even though I see a substantial

burden with respect to Mississippf-bcund Louisiana commerce in

26

this case, I do not see any discrimination of constitutional
import.

There*s certainly no intentional discrimination.

And such discrimination as results, if you call disparity of
results discrimination, it*s produced by the action of the
State of Louisiana.
In other words, what did it have to lose by signing
a reciprocal agreement with Mississippi that was valuable or
that could be reconciled with the interstate commerce clause?
We say nothing.
Now, as I say, once this Baldwin vs. Seelig line of
cases is analyzed, the result will simply be that we're not
favoring domestic commerce with respect to all other out-ofStata commerce.
Now, on the matter ~~ to conclude, the matter of the
equal protection claim:

Jurisdictionally we say it's not here.

There's just simply been no amendment to the complaint
to reflect a practice or procedure by the State of Mississippi
in allowing grandfather clause access.
thought in the case.

This was simply an after­

Counsel for A&P at one point, determined

that some dairies from the State of Louisiana were coming in.
So he decided that was an equal protection violation, because
others could come in, but he couldn't.
Well, how is ASP to be advantaged if this Court should
enjoin Mississippi from carrying out its grandfather policies?
In effect, that would just disadvantage A&P's competitors without

27
helping itself.
But, jurisdictionally, the —
QUESTIONi

Well, isn't that the point?

Put them

all on an equal basis.
MR. LADNER:

„
Well, I cite Golden vs. Zwickl&r for the

authority that as a standing matter, you don't have standing
merely to dsadvantage your competitors if you cannot attain
any beneficial relief yourself.
But this controversy about the equal protection
belongs in the Court of Appeals.

That's what I'm seiying.

Louisiana makes the statement in its Jurisdictional
Statement that Mississippi has adopted this grandfather clause
policy ultra vires, without any statutory authority.
Well, that, in itself, implicitly concedes that you
don't have an injunction of a Statewide statute of Statewide
import.

What you have is sort of a quasi-declaratory judgment.
As a jurisdictional matter, the controversy is just

simply — the equal protection controversy is simply not here —
QUESTION:

Have you explained why Mississippi permits

the grandfather operation?
MR. LADNER: Well, ‘that was a matter that, of course —
QUESTION: Aren't the reasons just as applicable to
those other producers as they are to A&P?
MR. LADNER: Well, Your Honor, once again I'm supposing,
because it was not developed in the record in this case; but

28
one supposes that when Section 11 was adopted, there were
predecessor regulations of some sort tinder which these companies
in Louisiana qualified.

And I have never — 1 don't — I

don't get the constitutional implications, even from an equal
protection standpoint, of the grandfather clause treatment.
In other words, there were rational reasons at the
time for these dairies in Louisiana to come in, and at the
time Section 11 was adopted, it applied only looking forward
and rot backward.
Now, access by these grandfather clause dairies is,
in one or two instances that I know of, merely local access.
That's another reason why the regulations allowing grandfather
clause treatment aren’t a Stafoawi.de statute or Statewide import.
In other words, some of the dairies in Louisiana had
access to merely three counties, the coastal counties in tha
State of Mississippi, adjacent to New Orleans.

But it's

largely undeveloped on this record, and we say it’s merely an
after-thought that it, jurisdictionally, is not proper in
this Court and can't be raised except in the Court of Appeals.
Thank you for your attention.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Ladner.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Christy?
MR. CHRISTY:

Just briefly, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER W. CHRISTY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR« CHRISTY:

As to the last matter raised, I think

the record will show that the information as to the four other
dairies, processors came out during th® testimony at the
initial hearing, A&P had no prior knowledge of this.

The

matter of the issue as to equal protection was raised before
the three-judge court.

It was brief by the parties.

And the

three-judge court specifically ruled on the issue.
It's in their opinion, their reason that they could
not enjoin Mississippi in that: practices, because if they did
it might prevent Mississippi from later on requiring reciprocity
from the four processors.
I don’t exactly understand their reasoning, but they
did rule on it.
I would just lik® to make a final point.
Counsel, perhaps inadvertently — I‘m sure it was
inadvertent — but he mads the; statement:

Louisian5 makes the

statement in its Jurisdictione! Statement.
We are not Louisiana, we’r® A£P.

And 1 think the

whole case, ea far as the appellee is concerned, is that we are
to be treated as though we are Louisiana.

We are simply a

processor in Louisiana, trying to sell our milk in Mississippi.
And w@ feel that the barriers erected by Mississippi to our
doing this are an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce,

30

and they should be stricken.
And we should be allowed a means of bringing out milk
in. This is what the Constitution requires, and it's not
sufficient, I submit, to say, Well, we are the good guys, and
we hav® reciprocity, and that's all we have to do.
That's not all he has to do, and I submit that although
their goals may be laudable, the effect of the law is to lock
us out.

And ws submit that the law should be stricken.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentleman.

The; case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:19 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
ahova-ertitled matter was submitted,]
