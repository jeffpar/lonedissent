ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. GILL, JR., ESQ.,
, OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GXLLs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© the

Courts
My name is John G. Gill, Jr.

I represent Alvin

Beckwith, the Petitioner in this case.
We*re her® seeking reversal of the District of Columbia
Circuit affirmance of his conviction on one count of attempting
to evade and defeat federal income taxes.
W<s feel that the trial court should have been reversed
-- ©r should be reversed, because it committed error in denying
the petitioner's pretrial motion to suppress statements made to
Special Agents of the Internal Revenue Service at a crucial
August 2nd, 1372, interview, which provided the entire starting
point for the net worth or expenditure, circumstantial evidence
theory ©£ prosecution, and without which we believe the
prosecution below' would not have been able to proceed.
Ti:i© facts brought out at that pretrial motion to
suppress — the trial took place on a stipulated record after
the denial of the motion to suppress — took the form of the
testimony of two Special Agents of the Intelligence Division#

4

th© Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service.
agents testified that in March of 1912 they received

&

Those
tip from

an informant that Mr. Beckwith, the petitioner., was not reporting
all ©f his income taxes.
During th® next three months, they testified, they did
a considerat 1© amount of investigations

into his background?

into his family? and, indeed, into specific transactions.
On August 2nd, 1972, unannounced, at 8s00 a»m. in th©
morning, they arrived at the home ©£ a friend in Silver Spring,
Maryland, where th® petitioner was staying.

Hi® petitioner had

to finish dressing, and they went into the dining room for
three hours, between 8s00 a.®, and 11s00 a.m.
Pries- to questioning, the agents read to him from a
card certain advice of rights which, is concededly short ©f the
warnings required by Mirajnda vs. Arizona, if that ease is held
to apply to these circumstances.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gill, you may

You h&v© 27 minutes Ioffe.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. GILL, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - Resumed
MR. GILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it pleas® the Courts
I believe I was to the point where I had mentioned
that limited warnings had been given to the petitioner.
During the next three hours, th© agents questioned
him about a number of things which, significantly, are incor­
porated into Stipulation No. 2, which mad® up the starting
point for the net worth prosecution.

Sources of possible non-

taxable income during the year 1971? cash on hand, going all
the %?&y back, I believe, to 1965 or, at least, to 1967»

And

other items, through which they buttoned down the starting
point for the prosecution.
The agents testified that his liquor store in the
District of Columbia was to ba opened at 10:30, and the
petitioner sent the person with whom he 'was staying, who was
also an employee at the liquor store, to open the store.
Thereafter, after the interview, he want and produced
certain records from the liquor store to the agents, without
any warrant or summons

6
The petitioner testified that h© was 44 years of age,
hs had a ninth grad© education, he knew very little about tax
returns — and this was corroborated by the observations of the
agents during their testimony.

He testified that ha had never

filed, or prepared an incoma tax return in his entire life.
QUESTION:

How would that affect, the merits of this

MR. GILL;

Well, in -the waiver context, Your Honor,

case?

it shows what a need for warnings there are, because, indeed,
there was absolutely no knowing waiver.

This case is perhaps

a graphic illustration of — this person testified ha had no
idea he was incriminating himself,
QUESTION;

You mean h® might just blurt out the

MR, GILL;

Our position, Your Honor, of course is that

truth?

the situation was coercive from a legal and psychological point
of view.
I think *»- I say this in the context of emphasising
the need for counsel, the need for an effective warning as to
his right to remain silent.
I don’t know if the truth or the non-truth of it is
significant for purposes of this argument.
QUESTION; Well, absent a violation of the Fifth
Amendment, which prohibits compulsory self “‘incrimination, I
presume society has an interest in seeing guilty defendants

7
incriminate themselves —
MR. GILLs
QUESTION:
MR. GILL;

Yes, Your Honor.
so long as it’s voluntary.
Yes, Your Honor.

This particular type of statements that were being
elicited from hira, though, was specifically recognized by this
Court fin Holland y?Uni tad States , to be probably unreliable
or, in many cases —* Point No. 5, which we have quoted in our
brief, says;

In this type of an interview, a taxpayer is mor©

often concerned with a quick settlement or placating the agents
than reliability.
If I could pick up that question. Your Honor. What
on® of us here, including myself, could go back four or five
years and tell how much cash we had on hand with reliability?
I think there was a great potential for unreliability
her®.
QUESTION: But certainly the man has it within his
power to say, "I don’t remember? I don't know.13
MR. GILL;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Maybe what he said, if anything 'that he

disclosed is not supported by the government's case in chief,
it perhaps isn’t all that revelent, is it?
MR. GILLs Well, there could be arguments made as a
matter of weight.

But, again, as this Court recognized in

Holland, the government agents can pick and choose among the

8

good and the bad and use them against him as party admissions
at. trial.

They are very incriminating, 1 think, especially in

•this situation.
The petitioner testified that he did not recall the
word "criminal55 being used by the agents. They testified they
had told him one of their functions was to investigate
criminal tax frauds **- the possibility of criminal tax frauds
brought.
He also testified he did not think he had incriminated
himself at all during the three-hour interview.
I.

We feel that the decision below and the requirement
of actual physical restraint and custody is improper for
Miranda purposes, for a number of reasons:
First of all, tills, we feel, in the meaning of -the
Fifth Amendment, was indeed a criminal case.

At the beginning

of his oral opinion, the District Judge, which is found in the
Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari, at lb, he found in
fact it was criminal from the very beginning. And his finding,
we feel, is supported by the

fact that there were approxi­

mately three months of investigation of the petitioner prior
to the interview.
We feel it5 s supported by what the United Statas
Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia issued in the
form of a press release at the time of indictment.

They said

petitioner was the subject of "legal harassment" by virtue of

s
the prosecution of the tax laws against those who they felt were
involved in narcotics underworld activity.
The obvious implication, we feel, being improvable
narcotic activity.

And w© point out that petitioner has no

record for such activity.
Also, the arrest was effected by the combined forces
of Internal Revenue agents and Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs agents.
We also feel, in addition to being clearly a criminal
case at the time of the interview, this was indeed a critical
stag©»
States.

We’ve already made reference to Holland vs. United
That Court recognizes,

in this type of prosecution,

the starting point is crucial to the government.

In fact,

without it, I don’t think they have any case? and I think it’s
been virtually conceded throughout the courts so far, that

they need that starting point, which came entirely out of
petitioner’s own mouth.
QUESTION;

Didn’t we hold, in Kirby v, Illinois,

that 'the critical stag® did not begin until there was an
indictment?
MR. GILL;

I’m not sure of the specific language.
t

I know that was in the lineup area.
QUESTIONs

More specifically, I think the holding

there might have been that the explicit right to the assistance
of counsel does not begin constitutionally until there’s an

I don’t think -**

QUESTION;

I don’t think it affected — I don’t think

it had much to do with the right against compulsory s®lf~
incrimination.
MR. GILL;

Yes.

And, Mr. Justice Relinquish, I said

"critical", I think in perhaps the Miranda terms, in the values
that Miranda sought to protect against*
Fifth Amendment value.

Specifically the;

And maybe I'm using "critical" — if

you take that as a term of art that was dealt with in Kirby vs.
Illinois with respect to counsel.
But for this prosecution, this hyp® of prosecution,
I feel it was indeed critical.
We feel ■—*
QUESTION;

Well, it’s always critical if something

happened that hurt your case.
MR. GILL;
QUESTION;

Yes.

And —

There’s always a critical moment, if at

that moment something happened that prejudiced you.
MR. GILL: And, Your Honor, I think — this was not
just on© bit of evidence, this was the whole starting point,
which is totally necessary to this entirely circumstantial
type of prosecution.
We feel that the District of Columbia Circuit's
requirement of the necessity for a finding of physical restraint

11
is particularly inappropriate for a tax prosecution, We focus
on the language which, at least four times, was repeated in
Miranda,

It said, custody "or otherwise deprived of his freedom

of action in any significant way/
Wa say custody is inappropriate for a tax case,
because arrest, or the taking of a person into physical restraint
by the government is a matter that, is foreign to the tax
prosecution in most cases,
commentators who says

We quote from Lsw Review

Anyone who knows anything afemt tax

prosecutions knows that arrest doesn’t have much significance
if it happens at all,

Also, identity is not an issue at all in a tax

MR. GILL; Becausa the person — I think you said a

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GILL:

The person who's confronted to answer

questions about a burglary, he has an orientation, if he's of
average intelligence.
Now, I know there-.are legal technicalities, as was
evidenced by the Escobedo case, where he said, WI didn't do it?

15
you did it*, and he exhibited some knowledge.
But, generally speaking, the person or the citizen
under investigation for an average on-the-street crime or a
crime has a familiarity.

terribly frightening to the taxpayer, because it is so unknown

Is there! any other point that is relevant

to whether or not this was custodial?
MR. GXLL:

Yes, Your Honor.

Tha combination of -<■*

and confusion in the mind of the taxpayers, as to his civil
obligations and his criminal rights under the Fifth Amendment,
to decline to incriminate himself.
And another point, fears -that. I will develop through
out my argument.

But I think this is one of the most signifi­

cant.
Miranda quoted at different places the concern and
the need for these warnings in the following language s

In each of these cases the defendant was thrust into

The subject matter of

the tax laws, we submit, is a terribly unfamiliar atmosphere.
Miranda, at another point, gives us:

nothing like the back room of the police station,
QUESTIONS But don't you have to read all those state­
ments in light of the fasts of the Miranda ease, that it was a

aren’t general philosophical observations in an opinion, ar©
they?

1 think they are, Your Honor.

MR. GILL:

I think

question:

Well, ©n that theory, than, one might claim

that if a policeman stops you on the street while you’re walking
and begins to ask you some questions, that you're unaccustomed
to talking to a policeman in a uniform, with a badge and a gun,
and therefore all the Miranda warnings must apply before the
policeman can have any conversation with you?
MR« GILL:

Well, I think Miranda itself sought not

to include that.
QUESTIONS

Yes, and several other cases.

MR. GILL;

It's a matter of degree

QUESTION: But you’re taking some language that related

17
to a police station and taking it out. of context,
MR, GILL:

I respectfully submit I*m not, Your Honor,

Because it was this concern with being swept away from any
focal point in which to make an intelligent choice,
QUESTION: What was the author of the opinion talking
about?

He was talking about a case in which the man was in a

police station, wasn’t ha?
MR, GILL:

Yes, Your .Honor,

QUESTION: Well, then, isn’t it out of context when
you take it out of a police station?
MR, GILL: Well, if you analyse it just from its
facts, I

agree, Your Honor.

But 1. "think, for purposes of my

presentation her©, I think it’s a good analogy.

The complexity

of the subject matter has put. this person into an unfamiliar
atmosphere, the «equivalent, m feel, of a police station.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gill, sir® you drawing any distinction

between a call by an ordinary revenue agent, if I may so
describe him, and a Special Agent in the Intelligence Division?
MR. GILL:

Yes, Your Honor*

QUESTION: Wall, it seams to me your , entire argument,
though, ie directed to a tax consultation.

Isn’t there as

much fear and trembling when the first agent shows up as there
is when a second on© does?
MR. GILL:

In many cases, yes, Your Honor.

the distinction is this:

sought t© protect people who are not likely to be charged in
a criminal case, and convict themselves out of their own mouth
in derogation of their Fifth Amendment right to refrain from

MR. GILL;

If it please the Court, he was given a

It’s the difference between

the defendant privilege in a criminal case and the witness

QUESTION:

Now, what is the other, if any — what

MR» GILLs

in the situation where a parson is being investigated for not
paying his taxes.

I think a legitimate inference is that he

21
have enough money to pay them.
The government's argument that tax cases are present
where there's a lot of money involved, I don't 'think holds up,
because there is that distinct possibility.
People are not paying their taxas because they

don't

have funds.
QUESTIONi WeiIf in t true Miranda situation, in a
conventional, plain vanilla, Miranda situation, where a person
is in custody at a police station and being interrogated by the
police,' the duty of the polio© to warn him that he’s entitled

certainly not predicated upon a preliminary finding of
indigency? is it?
MR. GILL;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Yes, you might? generally speaking.

QUESTION: A great many people do incriminate them­
selves when they sign their tax returns, don't they?
MR. GXLLs

Yes, Your Honor.

However, when these agents

visit him, to interrogate

him or ask him questions, and they*re building a criminal case
against him, he is under a compulsion that derives from the fact,
that he knows he*11 be subjected to a full-scale audit.
Socially embarrassing, when contacts ar© mad© with your clients,
your friends, your customers, your creditors? potentially
because the taxpayer in almost all matters has the burden of
proof, potentially vary expensive, if those agents are dis­
satisfied and they assess a deficiency.
These pressures, we feel, ar© at his mind, and -this
is what's been recognized by the Seventh Circuit,

tod, on the

whole, the analysis is that there are such pressures, both from
a legal,

civil-legal point of view, confusion, complexity,

that the taxpayer must be warned of the full rights under
Miranda, or his privilege against self-incrimination.
I think it’s pointed up, if this Court takes note of
two cases, Malloy vs. Hogan arid Holland vs. United States, under
the warning that was given here, how could a parson in
petitioner's circumstances, a ninth-grade dropout, ever know
that to incriminate yourself had the broad meaning of Malloy vs.

24

Kogan?
How could he know that by telling him how much cash
he had on hand a few years back could incriminate him in the
complex type of prosecution that was being built against him?
Your Honor, I'd like to mention one more thing ~~
QUESTIONS

Well, how could he ever waive counsel,

then, by himself?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT F. CRAMPTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, CRAMPTON:

Mr. chief Justice, and may it please

toe Courts
2*d like to emphasise briefly certain facts that we
believe to bo salient her®.
First, tlie age? he*s 44 years of age,
manager of a liquor store,
to© corporation.

He was the secretary-treasurer of

He had stipulated taxable income that he had

26
spent, the $24,600, while his return had reporter $10,000»
Counsel speaks of the complexity of the tax laws,
I don’t think that complexity really is pertinent here»

There

was a question of whether or not he had $24,000 of income -that
he could spend»

They asked him whether he had any cash on hand

at various periods of the time, the beginning of each year»
I don't think it’s unreasonable to ask a parson whether ha had
three or four hundred dollars on hand at any given time, or
whether he had ten or fifteen thousand dollars on hand.
They asked him if he had any inheritances, any gifts,
and he said he did not»

was given

the

customary Internal

Revenue

Service

warning,

which advised him that the agents could not compel answers to
information that slight tend to .incriminate him, and that his
answers might be used against him in a criminal proceeding.
And, furthermore, and quit© significant, 1 believe,
he was told that he could have the assistance of an attorney
before responding.

And he admitted in his own testimony that

he did have an attorney~accountant that had prepared his
returns, so that he knew whether or not he wanted to have that
man present.
QUESTIONS Well new, General Crampton, you say you

You’re not implying that you

MR» CRAMPTONs Well# I think it shows that the agents*

No*

It*s not:,

But I'm saying we did

I think it was
QUEST I OK* Well , then, I don't see why it’s signifi*-

cant, if I may say so*
MR* CRAMPTON* Well, the significance, ass I say, is,
I think, that ha had the counsel and h© didn’t elect to bring
him in,
QUESTIONS At least you ought to argue that lastI
[Laughter„3
MR, CRAMPTON* All right, sir,
%

Another thing is h© testified at the trial that he
understood the warning# and he also said that, he was asked by
the agents to read the warning out loud, and that he did that*
The agents described the interview a® friendly.

And

til© defense counsel agreed, in his argument to the court, that

it was friendly? and the d@fcmr3.ant, in his own testimony#
referred to the parties as "cracking jokes and laughing",
* They later want to the liquor store to obtain some
records.

They went in separate cars*

I think there was a 45««
i

minute interval there*

And at that time he delivered the books

and records, after again being told that he did not have to do
so,
Th© defendant also said that he chose not to answer
certain questions that were asked him# and that h© was not
pressed by th© agents for his answer.

29

After a hearing* the testimony of the two agents and
the petitioner here* the District Court found he is entitled
to it* the Miranda warning* when the court finds as a fact that
there were custodial circumstancess
“I have to find a situation that required it* and I
find* on this record* that there is no evidence whatsoever of
any such situation,”
A little later h® went on and he said ha knew he
could have a lawyer* and he knew that he didn’t have to say
anything t© them.
And* finally* "I find from the evidence* and it is
uncontradicted* that his basic rights were in fact explained
to him, '’
Whan the cas® was considered by the Court of Appeals*
that Court said*

in

parts

There is

no claim that Beckwith*s

mental condition or education ware so limited that, he was
particularly susceptible to interrogation? the entire interview
was free of coercion.
It was also noted by the Circuit Court that the
defendant was complaining that the meeting was so friendly that
he was deceived into believing that he was not incriminating
himself.
The defendant apparently contends that this was a
criminal cas© from the outset* and that he should have had the
full Miranda warnings.

30
As we understand his position, he wants to extend
Miranda far beyond ‘the custodial circumstances considered in
that opinion»
At the outset# wo dispute his basic premise, that
the case was criminal from the outset»

The case originated

from information furnished by an informante

,000»..

In 1972 the Internal Revenue Service initially
[sic]
screened 132 allegations of fraud.
Only 8,000 of these
actually resulted in an investigation, and out of the 3,000
only — prosecution was not recommended in 7,000»
out of eight cases ended up as civil matters.

Thus, seven

The actual

prosecutions were in the neighborhood of a thousand.
The taxpayer’s brief even says ‘that seven out of
eight c®s@s ar© not prosecuted.

So that when this cas© started,

n© on® could say this was going to be a criminal case at the
outset,
QUESTIONS
was?

Well, would it be any different if it

Let’s assume they had crime on the mind,
MR, CRAMPTONz

No, I don’t think it would. But I

don't think that «—
QUESTIONS

Well, argue that last, then!

[Laughter, 1
MR, CRAMPTONs

I’ve got several I have to argue last,

then.
But I think the point here is • that we ~~ the taxpayer

31
was not in the same situation as on© who is under arrest.
The self™incrimination clause says no parson shall be compelled
in any criminal case t© be a witness against himself,

The

Miranda Court found the compulsion to exist from the custodial
circumstances,
Here there have — as I say, the District Court found
none» And as? we read this Court's ©pinion in Schneckloth vs,
Buatamonta, the Miranda warnings do not reach an investigat®
questioning of a person not in custody',
QUESTION:

Mr, Crampton, did these agents give him

that usual spiel that, "You know, you can tail me this, or 1
can get it some other way"?
MR» CRAMPTONj

The record doesn’t say that, Mr,

Justice Marshall,

I don’t think — the fact that they

there three

the record of that type of testimony,
QUESTIONt

Well, I’m glad to see some government

officers that work at eight o’clock in the morning.

Do they

get cut that early ©11 the time?
You know, you could be waking a man up at eight
o’clock in the morning,
MR, CRAMPTON; This man said he started work at
seven-thirty, and he knew whan the man went to the liquor store.
apparently, and so he was there to mast him

32
The taxpayer argues that the interview with the
Internal Revenue agent had a psychological,, coercive effect
upon the taxpayer.

But* as the Chief Justice, I think, has

already indicated, that same thing could be said of the police
officer who stops the nervous housewife.

She certainly doesn’t

have to — he doesn’t have to give her a Miranda warning before
asking to see her driver’s license.
The defendant talks of a warning needed when the case
reaches the accusatory stag®, and since only one case out of
132 ripens into an indictment, I think it's very difficult t©
say when such a nebulous test would ba applied.
It seams to us that, short of a reference of a cas®
from the Internal Revenue Service to the Department of Justice,
the question, then, is where to draw the line, and wa think
that this court has drawn an appropriate line whan they talk
about the custodial circumstances.

This is a rule adopted

in ton out of the eleven Circuits, all but the Seventh, as
counsel has noted.
The defendant argues to the contrary, but his basic
authorities are sorris Law Review articles and case notes? and
we submit that the reasoning of the various Circuit Courts that
have considered this is,by far, more persuasive.
Finally, if a warning is deemed to be necessary, it
seems that the one given here was sufficient.

It warned him

of possible criminal consequences, that there was no need for

33

him to incriminate himselfr and that he could have an attorney»
It fell short of the Miranda warning in two regards :
one, with the right to remain silent? and, second, the right
to am appointed attorney»
We submit, in tax cases, that the law requires records
to be kept and returns to be filed, and that if taxpayers could
always remain silent, the self-assessment system would be
seriously undermined»
It also seams clear that there’s no need to offer
appointed counsel at the time of each investigation»

We

submit that the judgment below should be affirmed,,
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION s

Very well, ~

Mr, Craxnpton, just as a matter of

curiosity, what is the routine used today by Special Agents?
Bo they have a — do they give Miranda warnings now in
consultations, before they start in?
MR» CRAMPTOH; To my knowledge, they still give just
the warning that was given her©»
QUESTIONS

Her®»

MR» CRAMPTON: That was — apparently there was some
conflict throughout the country as to what was being don©»

I

think that’s one of the reasons why the Internal Revenue
Service issued this requirement»

And, as far as I know, that's

the on© that’s still in effect, and they ar® still using it»
QUESTION: And tee buildup of tea Seventh Circuit line

34
of cases hasn’t changed that at ail?
MR. CRAMPTONs
aUEST10Ns

No*

NO*

Unh-hunh.

MR. CRAMPTON:

The Seventh Circuit really stands

;

alone in requiring the Internal Revenue Servies to go that far.
QUESTION:

What about this administrativa development

that Mr. Gill told us he learned about Friday evening?
MR. CRAMPTONs Well, I read

about it in the papers.

It’s some report that they made, saying that, a lot of people
have difficulties with examinations by the Internal Revenue
Service, I guess. Well, 1 don’t think that’s really very new or
vary important* Everybody knows that*

But the way to avoid

that is —
QUESTION: Well, why was it news in the papers, then?
MR* CRAMPTON: Well, apparently, some group had been
working for

several years in building a report that was to foe,

I think, discussed with the Internal Revenue Service to see
if changes could ba made somewhere along in their administra­
tion .
QUESTIONs

Well, there were a couple of letters to

the Editor criticising on© newspaper’s treatment of it, too,
weren’t there?

From the head of the Administrative Procedure

Commission and from a former Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yea, there were.

Several of the

Commissioners of Internal Revenue wrote in, saying that they

I

-thought ‘that the publicity given it had not been a fair
appraisal of it.

I do remember that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon# at Is40 o’clock# p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.3
