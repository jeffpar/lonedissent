MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Goldberg against the United States,
6293.
Mr. Smaltz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD C. SMALTZ ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMALTZ:
the Court:

fir. Chief Justice, and may it please

The case comas to this Court on a writ of

certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The case

involves petitioner's conviction for violations of the mail
fraud statute 18 U.S.C. 1541.
The indictment charged that the petitioner, Mr.
Goldberg, and Edwin S. Newman and three other codefendants
had violated the statute in connection with the issuance of
single premium annuity policies to various individual annuitants
who in turn pledged those annuities as collateral for existing
or for new loans with various lenders.

The annuities were

issued from a life insurance company located in Phoenix,
Arizona, known as Financial Security Life Insurance Company,
sometimes referred to in the brief as FSL.

The indictment

charged that the defendant and his codefendants made false
statements to the lenders who considered making loans or who
made loans on the policies.
All of the defendants, with the exception of

petitioner and Newman, pleaded guilty to one or more counts
prior to petitioner's trial.

Petitioner's case went to trial

by itself and he was found guilty of 14 counts of the
indictment and sentenced to two years in prison on each of the
counts, said sentence to run concurrently and fined $1,000
per count.
Following petitioner's conviction, Newman, whose
case was severed about a week before petitioner's case was
scheduled for trial, the indictment against Newman was dismissed
and he was permitted to plead guilty to two misdemeanors.
The issue on which the writ was granted was whether
the Jencks Act contains an attorney's work product exception
and whether a government attorney’s notes of conversations
with key government witnesses to whom the prosecutors have
read back their notes from time to time where the witness
would correct the prosecutors' notes from time to time, if
not compellable under the terms of the Jencks Act, are
compellable under Brady doctrine.
Subsequent to this Court's granting of the petition,
the United States conceded for the first time that certain of
the notes contained in a packet of notes which was first lodged
in the Court of Appeals on .August 12, 197 4, at the time of oral
argument, that certain of these notes were in fact not the
notes of the prosecutors as has been represented all the way
up the line, but in fact were the handwritten notes of the

witnes s Netoman.
QUESTION;

I do not recall, Mr. Sinaltz, but was that

set out in the petition for certiorari?
MR. SMALTZ:

No, sir, and I am going to get to that.

It was not set cut in the petition for certiorari because it
was a fact unknown to petitioner at the time he filed the
petition and the government did not make the disclosure until
shortly before petitioner filed his opening brief in this case.
QUESTION;

And now much of the so-called Jencks

issue here involves those particular notes?

Those written by

Newman.
MR. SMALTZ:

Your Honor, out of 237 pages, 40 pages

are in Newman's handwriting.
QUESTION:

Forty out of 237.

MR. SMALTZ;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And the rest of the 237 are —

MR. SMALTZ: ‘Are written primarily in the handwriting
of Mr. Lebowitz and —
QUESTION:

He was the attorney for the government,

lie was one of two attorneys, and the other

prosecutor's name was Keilp.

Primarily most of the notes are

in Mr. Lebowitz8 handwriting.
QUESTION:
Newman, are they?

And these are notes of conversations with

6

MR. SMALTZ;

Yes, sir, they are.

Wow, the government has contended in its brief that
because the Court did not grant the writ as to the notes in
Newman's handwriting, that petitioner is foreclosed from
discussing this matter.

However, it is petitioner’s conten­

tion that the matter is properly before the Court for two
reasons:
First of all, the Brady argument made in the
application for the writ subsumes the issue of evidence
favorable to a defendant.
QUESTION;

Are you assuming, Mr. Smaltz, that any-

taxing impeaching within the language of the Jencks Act
necessarily is embraced within Brady?
exculpatory evidence, as I recall.

Brady talked about

It didn't say that any­

thing impeaching to a witness for the government was necessarily
exculpatory.
MR. SMALTZs

Well, I am not saying that all Brady

materials are necessarily Jencks materials, or all Jencks
materials are necessarily Brady materials.
area there where they overlap.

But there is an

And if the government fails

to produce upon timely demand materials in its possession which
will impeach its key witness, while they will engender a
violation of Jencks, I submit, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that
they can also engender a violation of Brady.
QUESTIONs

What’s your authority from this Court for

7
■tiiat proposition?
MR, SMALTZ:

Weil, in Palermo v. United States

in -the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan, I believe
he indicated that the commands of the Constitution were close
to the surface of the decision of this Court in Jencks v.
United States.
QUESTION:
did it?

That opinion didn't have much support,

How many votes did that get?
MR. SMALTZ:

I think Mr. Justice Douglas in

Augenblick indicated that the commands of the Sixth Amendment
are close to the surface of the Jencks Act.
number of lower courts, one of them being

I believe that a
Johnson v. Johnson,

have indicated that the Jencks Act embodies the constitutional
provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, an issue that we
dealt with at some length in our brief.
Secondly, the second reason why this Court can
consider the issue of Newman's handwritten notes is that the
doctrine of plain error enables the Court to consider it, and
since it was the government’s failure to disclose this
material both to the trial court and to the Ninth Circuit,
petitioner cannot be charged with the responsibility for not
knowing of these matters because he was not furnished a
packet of these notes until August of 1975 when the Solicitor
General's office for the first time provided him with a copy.
QUESTION:

What is your authority from this Court for

8

that proposition that what might be plain error

when reviewed

by a Court of Appeals is a basis for expanding the grant of
a

writ in this Court?
MR» SMALTZ:

Your Honor, I thought that the plain

error doctrine is a doctrine that is used only in extra­
ordinary circumstances, but when some act or some error exists
which substantially affects the fairness, integrity, or
probable reputation of judicial proceedings, I believe that
is an accepted definition of when the plain error doctrine
will apply.

And that being the case, I submit that the

government's failure to disclose the true character of
what was in its possession rises to the level of plain error.
QUESTION:
was

Mr. Smaltz, to back up a minute, when

this material handed to the Court of Appeals?
MR. SMALTZ:

Your Honor, it was handed to the

Court of Appeals at the time of oral argument.
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTZ:

MR, SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Were you there?
Yes, sir.
Well, you knew it was handed to them.
Yes, sir, I v/as there.
I thought you said a minute ago you didn’t

know about this until after you filed your petition for
cert.
MR. SI4A.LTZ:

No, we did not receive copies, your

Honor, or inspect copies of these notes until after the

9

petition for certiorari had been granted.

We received those

copies in August of 1975,
What had happened was this], Mr. Justice Marshall.
In the court below, in the trial court, and initially in its
brief to the Ninth Circuit, fch€? government contended that the
notes relating to Newman, their handwritten notes of their
conversations with him, held in fact been delivered to the
trial judge for an in camera inspection.

They said so in their

appellate brief to the circuit.
We had taken the position that the trial court had
never made an inspection.
the circuit.

That was one of our complaints to

And ultimately the government admitted its error

and they admitted it. at the time of oral argument when the
prosecutor stood up and requested permission from the court
to file the packet of notes.

And he said, "These are all the

notes that I can now locate."
Now, there is a factual dispute about that, and I
understand that the government has filed an affidavit of the
prosecutor, Mr. Lebowitz, who avows to this Court that in
essence what he told the circuit was that these are all the
notas, period.

We have filed a contrary affidavit which is

an exhibit to our reply brief.
QUESTIONS

We are not in a position to pass on some

evidence, are we?
■ MR. SMALTZ:

Well, I would think not, your^Honor,

10

but since the government has lodged these notes as materials
which were not part -QUESTION:

Did the Court of Appeals consider the

Jencks Act material?
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, your Honor —
If you know.

MR, SMALTZs

The Court of Appeals in its opinion

stated that the notes that had been

— the notes of the

prosecutors — I will give you the precise language.
QUESTION:

The notes were the work papers.

MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, sir?
Were the work papers, isnat that what

they were?
MR. SMALTZ

%

They were work papers -- the court

said this, the Circuit Court:

''Apart from the question

whether such notes were exempt from the Jencks Act as ’Work
product,"they were not statements of the defendant within the
meaning of 3500(e).,

We find no clear, prejudicial error."

That9 s found at Appendix 120.
The court indicated in its opinion that they examined
the notes. : 2' think you have to assume that.

But I have some

doubt as to whether they could make a meaningful examination
for a variety of reasons.

When the government lodged this

237-page packet, the notes are interspersed, there is no
pagination to the notes.

There is no chronological order to

the notes.

There was no explanation by the government as to

who wrote what at the time they were filed.
QUESTION:

What were the circumstances?

You said

they were delivered to you in August of 1975?
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes,, sir.
Was there some explanation made why they

were delivering them to you in August 1975?
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
What was the explanation.

MR. SMALTZ;

The Solicitor General said that they

were going to file these notes with this Court, and also they
were going to file other materials which were not part of the
record which ~~>
QUESTION:

But you actually were given a copy of

them?
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I was.
Is that what suggests that the government

conceded in August 675 that you should have had those when
you made the demand at time of trial?
MR. SMALTZ:

1 would like to view it as a concession,

your Honor, but I don’t think the government so regarded it
as a ““

And at the time the notes

QUESTION;

In my experience in Jencks Act cases, and

there have been quite a few since I earn® here since the Jencks
Act was passed, since I wrote the Jencks opinion, those things
were always handed up in camera.

The parties were not given

them if the government takes the position that they are not
subject to being handed over under the Jencks Act.

So I don’t

MR. SMALTZ:

I got them, your Honor,

as w® were

putting the finishing touches on our opening brief.

And I will

take anything 1 can get from the government.
QUESTION;

But you had them when you filed your

petition for cert, did you?
MR. SMALT2;
QUESTION:

No, I did not, your Honor.
That's the date I think that is left in

some doubt.
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION;

The petition for certiorari was filed —
I'm trying to find the date here, and I

can't find it.
MR. SMALTZ:

In the case, on April 3, 1975.

We did

not receive the notes until sometime in the second week of
August 1975.
In our reply brief filed on behalf of petitioner,
at pages 16 and 17 there is a chart which we have prepared
and is printed in the brief which summarises the various
stages of what occurred with* regard to these notes and the
positions taken by the government.

The positions vary

depending upon the court involved.

In fact, the Solicitor

General in filing his response or his opposition to the
petition for certiorari never even hinted that any of the
notes that were lodged with the Ninth Circuit and which were at
issue in this case were in fact authored by Newman.
So in essence we have two different sets of notes,
those prepared by the prosecutors and those prepared by the

14
witness himself.
Now* this case presents an unusual Jencks Act case
in the sense that the petitioner* that. Hr. Newman* who was the
key witness against the petitioner, was required by virtue of
a contract entered into with the government to make a full and
complete statement.
charged.

Newman was codefendant in the scheme

Immediately prior to trial he entered into a written

deal with the government.

The pl>ea agreement appears in the

Appendix at pages 48 to 50.

Under the terms of paragraph 1

of the agreement Newman was to give a complete statement under
oath concerning those events which were alleged in the indict­
ment.

Under paragraph 3(a) of that agreement tine government

agreed to sever Newman, and Newman agreed to testify for the
government, said testimony being in conformity with the statement
having bean given to the United States Attorney under oath
before trial.

Further, that in the event Newman failed to

honor the terms of his plea agreement with the government,
that the government would us© his pretrial statement under oath
as well as his testimony at the trial of petitioner against
Newman in a subsequent trial.
The agreement also provided that if petitioner's
case went to trial, Newman would plead guilty to a felony, but
if petitioner pleaded guilty, then Newman would be permitted
to plead two misdemeanors, and in both instances the government
would recommend probation for —-

QUESTION;

On what page in the Appendix do we find

that, Mr. Smaltz?
MR. SMALTZ;

Your Honore at pages 48 to 50.

The

precise p&g© is 48 and 49.
As it turned out,, Mr. Newman was the 35th and last
witness called by the government in its case-in-chief.
also the.sole rebuttal witness.

He was

Newman purported to testify

on direct examination practically in ipsissimis verbis to 91
conversations he allegedly had with petitioner which in turn
linked petitioner to the illegal scheme and allegedly
demonstrated petitioner’s knowledge in scienter.
Newman’s testimony on direct examination lasted three
days and spanned 440 pages.

He was the key to th© government’s

case, a fact even the Solicitor General’s office acknowledges,
and he had worked with the petitioner in petitioner's various,
insurance companies for over a decade,

Newman was a lawyer

and he was a signatory to all the correspondence which emanated
from Financial Security Life Insurance Company to the lenders,
arid all but two of fcfhe count, mailings from the insurance company
were executed and/or sent by Newman.

It was Newman who after

consulting a Phoenix attorney provided th® form of responses
to the lenders which were utilized by FSL and which ultimately
resided in petitioner’s indictment.
During the course of the trial the judge as well as
the prosecutor described the correspondence which emanated from

IS
Newman as the crux of the government's case.
Nowf on the very same day that this plea bargaining
agreement is dated between Newman and the government/ which is
May 11/ 1973/ Newman participated in a 2-1/2-hour question and
answer session with two attorneys for the government, Messrs-

Doyle Marshall, Mr. Newman's own counsel, and a reporter.
Newman's testimony briefly -QUESTION:
MR. 8MALTE:

By ’’reporter* you mean a court reporter?
Court reporter, y@s, sir.

Newman's testimony briefly touched on some, of the
matters alleged in the indictment, but it did not cover all of
his testimony in direct.

The session, this May 11 session

with the two prosecutors and the court reporter, concluded
with the prosecutor's observation as follows:
the time is now 4:30.

"For the record,

We have not exhausted all the trans­

actions on which Mr. Newman can testify,

We intend to

continues this discussion off the record at a later time as
well as the Goldberg

transactions which will b@ explored at

a further time."
On cross-examination by petitioner of Newman —
QUESTION:

Before you leave that, you did have a

copy of the transcript of the May 11th interview, didn't you?
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I did.
So you were on notice that, there would be

17
a further conversation..
MR. SMALTZ;

Yes, sir, I was, and that's where our

cross-examination commenced when w© began it with Mr. Newman.
On cross-examination tha petitioner established that
Newman met with just the two prosecutors, Messrs. Lebowitz
and Keilp, on May 12, June 9, June 10, June 11, and June 16,
1973.

At those sessions no reporter was present and neither

war® either of the two postal inspectors who were assisting
the prosecution of this case.
On cross-examination with regard to what happened
at these sessions, Newman testified that the prosecutors would
take notes which they would read back to him from time to
time and which Newman would correct.
After establishing these facts, petitioner moved
for production of these notes under the authority of the
Jencks Act.

The court, without waiting to hear from the

government and without inspecting any of the notes, denied
petitioner's request sui sponte on the basis that these notes
constituted the prosecuting attorneyse work product»
Petitioner twice thereafter, the following two days, renewed
his motion for production of these notes under the terms of
Jencks,

the second time

in a written memorandum which

asserted that the notes if outside the Jencks Act were
compellable under the doctrine of Brady v. Maryland.

18
QUESTION:

Wer© any of tha notes you ars talking

about now, did they include these 40 pages you told us about?
MR, SMALTS:

I don't know what they included at

that time* Mr. Justice Brennan»
QUESTION:

You don't know when those 40 pages of

notes were handwritten by Newman,
MR, SMALT Z:
QUESTION:

No, sir,
Certainly they are not referred to in

the original transcript copy which you did have.
MR. SMALT2s

No, sir, they are not part of the

May 11 statement.
QUESTION:

Which must paean they must have been,

at some time later, on one of the dates that you have given
us up through June.
MR. SMALTZ:

I think that's a fair inference.

I

think something that adds to -that inference is the fact that
when the prosecutor lodged these materials with the Ninth
Circuit, they , are in response to the fact that the petitioner
was claiming that he was entitled to the notes.
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

As of those particular dates.
Yes, sir.
And they did include these 40 pages,

that which was handed up included those 40 pages.
MR. SMALTZ:

Yes, I assume so.

I never saw tha

notes, but according to the Solicitor General's office —

.19

QUESTION:

Nov? that you have been interrupted, may I

ask you something just to clear my own mind?
Is 1di@ only discussion of this issue the single
paragraph on page 122 of the Appendix?
MR. SMALTS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That is, the only discussion in the

Court of Appeals.
MR. SMALTZs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it is.
Was it 122?

120.

120, the second full

paragraph on the page on page 120 is the entire discussion of
this issue in the Court of Appeals.

MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTZ:

That is correct.
Thank you.
Now, the district court judge on these

three occasions the request for the notes was made, without
ever examining the notes, met each motion with the assertion
that the notes ware, work product and refused even to inspect
•the notes in camara.
QUESTION:

Where do we find in the record his

statement that he did not?'

MR. SMALTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe at pag© 94

is where the di.strict court judge for the first time enunciates
the work product doctrine hare.

QUESTION;

H© was modest about it.

QUESTION:

Before you continue, is it necessary

for us in coming to a decision in tills case to know whether
or not any particular notes were identified by Newman as
having been read back to him?
MR. SMALTZ;

I think for purposes of the Jencks Act

that fact is a key fact.
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTS;

But are any notes so identified?
No, none of the notes that the prosecutor,

Solicitor General's office, have lodged with the Court are so

21
identified.
QUESTION:

And how do you think the case should b@

disposed of?

a lot of time and effort had 'they reversed and remanded the
first time around.
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTS;
Campbell

That doesn’t answer my question.
Well, I say, your Honor, that in

that was decided, as I recall, in 1963 -- the

Jencks Act was then still a relatively now pise© of legislation
QUESTION:

Yes, but questions whether or not these

particular notes are the notes that were read back and, as you
told us, were corrected by him, questions of -that kind I take
it could under a Campbell disposition be determined with the
trial judge than free to reinstate the verdict or not as he
may determine whether the notes should have been turned over.
MR. SMALTS:

If I may suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan,

I think that the Court’s opinion in Clancy v. United States
is more appropriate, for this reason:

In the first place, the

22

government has conceded that at least some of the notes were
Jencks Act statements and should have been turned over.
They
?
take the position that it was harmless error.
But as the
Court held in Clancy, one© it’s established that some of the
notes are Jencks Act statements and the defendant had been
denied those notes through the actions of the government, it
is not for appellate courts to speculate as to th© us® that
could have been made.
Further, I submit it’s a very difficult decision --QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals here didn't reach

this work product issue, but it did say apparently that non®
of the papers that had been handed up to them constituted
statements within the meaning of the Jencks Act.

It's a threshold issue, if you are going to deal

with the case the way the Court of Appeals did.

of them are statements.

Yes, -they have, your Honor, I believe

We pointed out in our reply brief that —

23

Jencks Act?
MR. SMALTZ:

No, but I agree that the facts that appear

in the record in the courts below *—
QUESTIONs

Well, what you are.suggesting is that

we do have to decide whether each one of these pieces of
paper is a statement or not.
MR. SMALTZs
that.

I don’t know that you have to decide

I know that ~
QUESTIONS

Well, surely, as to those that we do not

know, as I understand the record at present, that in fact
Newman had corrected them, had them read back, and adopted
them.
MR. SMALTZ:
QUESTION:

He so testified,
I know, but as I understand it, to which

he testified we don’t know of the many papers that have been
filed here,
MR. SMALTSs
QUESTION:

We do not.
Now, doesn't that set up a factual issue

as to whether or not those particular documents are or are not
statements within the. meaning of the Jencks Act in the sense
that have they been adopted by the government’s witness?
if that's so, why doesn't 'that require a Campbell hearing?
MR. SMALTZ:

Well

It would certainly also have helped in

whether or not it was something read back to th© witness

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN
OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FRIEDMAN:
tne Court:

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it please

I would like to take a minute or two at the outset

to try to explain the notes handwritten by Newman.

Some of

wnat I say about them is not in the record, arid I want to make
that clear.

But I think it's important to understand what we

at least have been informed about these notes, because it might
clear some things up.
QUESTION:

Would you tell us what is in the record

and what is not as you go along?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, I will, Mr. Justice: Marshall.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Now, it is true that there were three

requests for Jencks material when Newman was testifying in the
government's case-in-chief.

In each case the request was for

prosecutors' notes, and in each case — well, at least in the
third case -— this is in the record — in the written motion
filed oy Mr. Smaltz he specifically said,

We are talking about

notes that were generated prior to the time that Mr. Newman
took the stand in the government's case-in--chief.

There was

no Jencks request when Newman took the stand as a rebuttal
witness.
In the appendix on page 110 Mr. Smalts begins to
lay the foundation and inquires:

Have you met with the

30
prosecutors again since you completed your testimony in the
government's cas@-in-ch.ief?
And the answer was yes, he spent all day on the
4th of July with the prosecutors and he has been at their
offices on an average of five hours a day since the 4th of
July»
And this all took placa, as I recall, on July 9, this
testimony.
The question was never asked what happened there,
did the prosecutors take notes, did you write notes?

There

was no request for Jencks materials.
VJe think
tile record.

— and let me say this, which is not in

We have been informed that all of the notes

handwritten by Newman were generated after he left the stand
in the government’s case-in-chief.

At the conclusion of the

trial again, and this is not in the record, the prosecutor
scooped up all the notes that related to Newman emd Newman's
testimony and things that Newman had told them and put them in
one pile, both the prosecutors’ notes and the notes written by
Newman.

IE@ did the same thing in relation to other witnesses.

He put them in his files.
In writing his brief in the Court of Appeals he made
a mistake.

Some notes relating to another witness not involved

in the issue here had fossn turned over for in camera inspection
uis recollection was that he had also turned these notes over

31
for in camera inspection.

That’s what he said in his brief

in the Court of Appeals.
At the time of oral argument in the Court of Appeals,
as I understand it, Mr. Smaltz had filed a brief that the
court had some question about whether it would accept because
it was too long for a reply brief, and some sort of an
arrangement was struck whereby he would waive oral argument if
the court would let him file his brief.

The government was

then asked would it waive oral argument, too.

Not wanting to

interfere with the court’s plan to save some time, the
government said sure.

As a result it did not have the

opportunity to explain all that was in the packet of notes that
was then being lodged with the court.

It did explain that it

made a mistake in its brief and now it would like to lodge
these notes,
QUESTION:

It was not orally argued before the Ninth

Circuit.
MR. FRIEDMANs

It was not orally argued before the

Ninth Circuit, as 1 understand it.
The notes were turned over.
QUESTION:

You mean filed.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Not turned over.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals —

Not turned over* to Mr. Smaltz.

Lodged.

32
MR, FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

Lodged.

Was that at fch© request of the court

or voluntary on the part of fch© government?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

I'm not sure,

I'm informed it was

voluntarily on the part of the government.
The court, since the issue before it was whether
prosecutors3 notes were statements and/or work product,
probably when it reviewed the notes operated under the
assumption that these were all written by the prosecutors,
although there were a number of different handwritings involvedj
there were a number of different prosecutors involved.

They

concluded on the face of the notes that they weren't statements.
Now, we operated on the assumption that these were
all prosecutors’ notes —
QUESTION:

They were not statements of the witness

Newman,
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Newman.

They were not statements of the witness

Now, the court said statements of the defendant, and

w® think that's just a mistake, because that's -QUESTION:

Obviously the statute deals with statements

of fch® witness.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Right.

If they were statements of

the defendant, they would have been turned over under Rule 16.
We found out that some of these notes were hand­
written by Newman after we had filed our opposition to the

33

cert petition and after the Court granted, cart, because
frankly that's the time we began to look at the case very
closely for the first time.
We felt obligated to explain the difference in the
notes and to make some argument regarding the Newman notes,
and because of all the confusion and because Mr. Smaltz had
not seen these notes, we gave him a copy of the whole packet
of notes.
QUESTION:

May I ask right there, Mr. Friedman, did

you give them to them because you thought they were Jencks
materials to which he was entitled?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Then why?

MR. Friedman:
QUESTION:

No.
I don’t follow it.

we were too generous perhaps.

Ordinarily tha U.S. Attorney if he

thinks they are not statements producible under Jencks Act
only lodges them, as my Brother Stewart says, with the
judge for in camera inspection, doesn’t he?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUES1ION:

That’s right.

And if he turns them over to defense

counsel, he turns them over because the U.S. Attorney agrees
they are producible Jencks statements, isn’t that it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In turning them over w® did not

intend to indicate to anybody that they were Jencks material.
QUESTION:

But the case was now here; certiorari

34
had been granted .
MR. FRIEDMAMs

That's right.

We're not talking about

the trial court, we're not talking about the Court of Appeals;
we are talking about here where w© want to make arguments
concerning work product, concerning what are statements, and
concerning, as a large portion of our brief discusses, the
kinds of things the prosecutors generally write, the kinds of
notes they create in preparing for trial as opposed to agents'
notes.

And in order to argue that and to permit Mr. Smalfcz

to argue it -- and again, maybe we were too generous — we
gave him the notes so he could respond.

This was no

concession.
QUESTION;

Why didn't you give them to him in the

Court of Appeals?

Why?

In the Court of Appeals, again, we

were arguing that on the face of the notes you can tell that

The prosecutors did not give it to

Although again I am under the impression that Mr.

Smaltz was at least given the opportunity to glance through
this packet of notes at that time, not a chance to see them,
have them, study them, but. to glance through them and see the
general nature of them.
QUESTION:

That's just your word against his.

35

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Xsm not sure he disagrees with that

statement»
QUESTION:

Well, It's not in the record anyhow.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

Again, it is not in the record.

As to the Newman notes —
QUESTIONs

May I just ask you this:

When this case

was in the Court of Appeals you did not know, or there'was not
an awareness of the person arguing on behalf of the government
that 40 pages of this stuff was in Newman's handwriting, is
that correct?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Since he was the prosecutor who tried

the case, he knew it, but it didn't register in his mind —
QUESTION:

He didn’t make it known.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

He just pulled the packet of notes

that said "Newman" on the cover and lodged them with the
Court of Appeals.
QUESTION;

And th© presumption, or the assumption,

the hypothesis, the premise in the Court of Appeals was that
all this handwriting was handwriting of various prosecutors,
government prosecutors.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think we have to assume that that's

what they assumed.
i

QUESTION;

Right.

QUESTION:

And if th® judge had examined them in

camera, would he have found that out, that some of these were

36
in Newman's handwriting?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well* it depends — well, if —

This is on the point that the judge

refused to look at them»

That's the only thing I was talking

about.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If they had been turned over at the

time the request was made, it is our understanding that the
Newman notes didn't exist, so they would not have been turned
over.

Since there was no renewed Jencks request when Newman

testified as a rebuttal witness, there was nothing that made
\

the prosecutors think that they even ought to turn these over,
there was no demand for it, they weren't thinking about it,
they were in the midst of a 7-week, trial.
So there are a number of things that can be don© about

FRIEDMAN: I think it was our obligation to make

known as soon as we were aware of it.

also our obligation to give Mr. Smaltz a copy of the packet of

perhaps we were too generous.

But certainly we had an

obligation to let —

office explaining relationships between Goldberg —

MR. FRIEDMAN:

We concede that it's a statement.

Within the meaning of the statute.

And it was not turned over to the trial

judge for his consideration.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Because there was no demand for it.
»

So .it's a statement
QUESTION:

Well, that depends upon when it was made,

and the question of when it was made is not one that's resolved

38

by the record.
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

That’s fair to say* Isn’t it?

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

That's right.

That's fair to say.

At least as to them then why isn't there

a Campbell proceeding required?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

What w@ have said in our brief is

that perhaps the appropriate procedure is for a Campbell hearing
as to those notes.
QUESTION:

You say you don't know when that 7-page

statement v/as made?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We think we know but it's not in the

record«
QUESTION:

You think you know* but isn't the record

clear enough that it was made before the testimony, his
direct testimony?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

The 7-page narrative, indeed all

of the 4D pages of notes handwritten by Newman, we are under
the impression, we have been told, were written after Newman's
direct testimony in the government's casa-in-chief and before
his rebuttal testimony.
QUESTION:

Before his testimony on rebuttal.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:
doesn't show it.

Ye§.

That's your understanding but the record

39
MR. FRIEDMAN;

That's our understanding.

And if you

look at the statement,, there is great support for that —•
QUESTION:

That may be true, Mr„ Friedman.

Obviously

we are not the tribunal, to resolve issues like that.
QUESTION:

Your understanding of the time sequence

is not supported by the record itself, is it?

This is part of

your off-the-record
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

It .is not supported by the record.

If we construe that what has been lodged

with this Court is part of the record/ we must accept the fact
that the record does contain statements by the witness that
were not disclosed to the defense.
MR. FRIEDMAN

%

It contains statements by the witness

that were not disclosed to the defendant.
QUESTION:

That’s in the record, if w© treat what

you have lodged with this Court as part of the record.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Now, on the other hand, when you look at the
statements, particularly the 7-page narrative, which is the
only thing we concede is a statement within the meaning of
Jencks, it relates to testimony given by a witness named
Paradise who testified as a defense witness after Newman
testified .in the government1 s case-in-chief, and when Newman
took the stand as.a rebuttal witness, he began to testify
concerning relationships with Paradine, and he was cut off by

40
an objection from Mr. Smalfcz, sustained by the court, at least
until the prosecutor could show the court in a transcript,
because it was daily copy, what part of Paradine's testimony
this was to rebut.

A page and a half of that 7-page statement

relates to the testimony before Newman was cut off.

In fact,

his testimony is almost verbatim from that 7-page statement.
So the inference, v/e think, is clear that it wasn't
created until after Newman left the stand and until after
Paradine had testified,

tod in any event only a page and a

half of 239 pages of noter» relates in any way to testimony
at trial, and it's completely consistent and almost verbatimly
consistent with what, he said at trial.
QUESTION:

That3s the type of argument that should

be made to the trial court instead of here.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's the type of argument that should

be made to the trial court, but —
QUESTION:

You concede this is a statement of the

witness, but you don't concede it's a statement of the witness
producible under the Jencks Act.
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

That's right.

Because it doesn’t concern the things,

the matters to which he testified.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

That's right,

tod. additionally, but

again this is something that we have to argue on the basis of
things outside the record, there was no renewed demand for

41
Jencks material afc the time —
QUESTION:

You think if th® Court of Appeals had

been told everything that it should have been told, or if it
had been told what you are telling the Court now, or if any
court had, it should have reached the same decision that the
Court of Appeals did, namely, these are not statements
producible —
QUESTIONS

If tli® facts are as you tell us.

MR. FRIEDMANS

Right.

QUESTION?

We don't, know that they are.

QUESTION:

We don9t, no.

QUESTION:

And that's why I can't understand why

this case doesn't automatically call for a Campbell hearing.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

At least as to the Newman notes.

Of course it does.

Well, I would say th©

whole works.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Not necessarily the prosecutors' notes

Now, again, maybe th© prosecutors did not turn th©
Newman notes ov©r to th© Court of Appeals,,
QUESTION:

Because th®v weren't in the record either.

MR, FRIEDMAN:

They weren't in th© record, h® knew

they didn't exist at th© time the Jencks request was mad®, the
Jencks request was only for prosecutors8 notes, it was only
for prosecutors5 notes that existed at the time that Newman
testified in the government3s case-in-chief.

There was no

rebuttal, and certainly none for-the. notes handwritten by
Nawman.

Mr. Friedman, someone, if this case goes

back on a Campbell remand, someone has got to go through the
mechanical process of turning these pages over one at a times
identifying the handwriting of on® person as distinguished
from another, that is, the notes of the lawyers that the
government has distinguished from -the tilings written in the
handwriting of Newman, is that not so?
)

MR. FRIEDMANs
QUESTION;

That's true, yes.

That means a hearing in the district

court would be required.
MR. FRIEDMAN :

I think that on the notes handwritten

by Mr. Newman that the record at -this stage, unless this Court
is willing to undertake the process of determining that there
was no error or harmless error, that there should be a
Campbell hearing with regard to the Newman notes.

The thrust

of our argument deals with the notes written by prosecutors,
I

and as we understand it, that's the issue the Court was
interested in when certiorari was granted.

We don't think there

has to be. that kind of a hearing with regard to those notes.
And the reason we say that is that by their nature and, in the
context of this case, lawyers' notes taken in preparation for

45

trial ar© not going to be 99 timas out of a hundred Jencks Act
statements.

He doesn't write a long narrative, continuous

account of things or he would naver be able to use the notes
in examining a witness in court.

We think it would be useless

to say that the Palermo and Campbell procedure of an in camera,
inspection and talcing of extrinsic evidence that applies when
agents make reports should always apply to prosecutors.
QUESTION?

May I ask, Mr. Friedman, as a matter of

curiosity really, I think this is the first Jencks Act case we
have had now in 10 or 15 years, isn't it?

I had the general

impression that the practice had grown up with perhaps the
help of the Justice Department,

of

u.S. Attorneys almost

automatically turn over,to defense counsel in trials everything
they have in the way of — no matter who took them — notes
of conversations with government witnesses after the government
witness had completed his direct examination.

Am 1 right in

that impression or not?
MR. FRIEDMAN?

I think the impression that you have

is 'wrong.
QUESTION:

Oh.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

And my own explanation ~~

Why don't we have more casas on it?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Because I don't think most people

believe that prosecutors' notes contain Jencks Act statements.
In ray own experience as an assistant U.S. Attorney, there were

never requests-- rarely requests — for prosecutors8 notes.
Prosecutors take notes — everybody has his own way of taking
notes obviously.

But you write down -the general subject matter.-

QUESTION;
witnesses then

What other statements of government
are automatically turned over as a matter

of course?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

What seams to m@ to be automatically

turned over are reports of investigative agents , FBI, secret
service, postal inspectors, that kind of thing, or the kind of
thing that we had here where the prosecutors took a statement
from him, a question-and-answer statement under oath, which is
clearly —
QUESTION;

Well, certainly there may b® statements

taken by prosecutors which would still be Jencks Act statements.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes.

Now, our position, as I think

we made —
QUESTION;

But those things, aren't they automatically

turned over?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes.

Our position is not that — and

that's why we don't say there is a broad attorney's work product
exception.

Just because something is taken down by a

prosecutor instead of an agent it's not exempt from the Jencks
Act.

But the nature of the kind of thing that is taken by a

prosecutor will normally not be a statement within the meaning
of the Jencks Act.

This 89-page statement under oath’ taken

47
by the prosecutors clearly is a Jencks Act statement.

But his

\

cryptic notations preparing himself to examine witnesses, 99
Y

f

times out of a hundred will not contain the kind of statements
that Jencks was talking about,
QUESTION:

Has this kind of issue come up before?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

It has come up in some of -the circuits,

and the circuits hav© considered the work product question and
generally they have said there is no broad work product
exception, but a number of them have said, But we have got to
look more closely when they are prosecutors' notes.

There are

certain problems that develop when they are prosecutors9 notes
)

we are talking about that don’t develop when they are
investigative agents* notes.

.And that's what we are trying to

say here.
QUESTION:

I take it that you think, that when the

facts are developed, if they are. developed, it will show that
you did turn over ©varything that you had that were statements
by the time the witness got off the stand on his direct
examination.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
I

Everything that was a Jencks Act

statement,, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, none of these papers involve^ you

think*were then in existence.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The notes taken by the prosecutors,

soma of -them were in existence, sir.

QUESTION;

But not the narrative.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

Not the narrative.

Mr. Friedman, would we have to enlarge the

question upon which we hav® granted certiorari in order to
reach th® Newman notes?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Wall, it may be subsumed within the

Brady question, but there i.s nothing exculpatory in them, and
he has had the notes for five months now, and it's pointed out
nothing is ~
QUESTION;

Then what do you think in answer to my

question?
MR. FRIEDMANS

I think tha answer is no, it is not

included within th® question upon which certiorari was granted.
But as we tried to point out in our brief it's not Mr. Smaltz*
fault that he didn’t raise the additional question.

We do

wonder whether th© Court would have granted cert on th©
additional question of the witness’ own handwritten notes,
because that’s clear, if they fall within the definition of a
statement and were written by th® witness, they should be
turned over.
QUESTION;

Of course, customarily we administer

certiorari not to do justice in individual cases but to try to
get before us issues that w© think are of significant importance
to the lav; in general.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That’s correct.

49

QUESTION:

But quit® often it appears after a grant

of certiorari that something has happened that leads us, for
I

example, to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.

We do

that at least several times during the course of a term because
of after-developing events,and after-developing ©vents in this
case might lead us to do something els© beside dismissing -the
writ, do as you suggest, for example, with respect to the
handwritten statement of Newman.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

As to the prosecutors* notes, however,

we think they are not statements.

An examination which the

Court of Appeals made shows they are not statements.
)

The

real kind of tough issue in the case, I think, is not the
question of what a statement is, but what is adopted or
approved, what does that mean.

And they must be, in order to

be producible under Jencks, both statements of the witness
and adopted or approved by ths witness.

These war® not

adopted or approved because we think adopted, or approved means
that the precise words written in th© notes have to be adopted
or approved or ©Is© it's not fair to try to impeach someone
with words that aren't his cwh«
|

And I think th© legislative

history supports us; I think that (e)(2) was intended to be
broader than (e)(1), not just the opposite, and the Court said
,'v

that in Palermo.
Even Mr. Smalts' —
QUESTION;

I want to go back a minut©.

Don't you

50
agree that in this case with the testimony before the judge
he should have at least looked at those?
MR. FRIEDMANi
QUESTION :

No, I don't,

Why?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

Because they were prosecutors' notes,

there was a representation by an attorney, an officer of the
court, that they were not substantially verbatim, not written
by the witness, not continuous, narrative kind of statements
included within the Jencks Act, and there is no evidence they
were adopted or approved within the meaning of the Jencks Act,
QUESTION:

I see.

MR, FRIEDMAN:

Th© general content of the notes, the

general facts were checked with the witness,but not the words
of the notas.

In effect, ~ Mr, Smalts, interestingly enough,

relies on a characterisation that th© Assistant U.S. Attorney
mad® in his brief in the Court of Appeals that entries in the
notes were only mad® after lengthy conversation and a mutual
understanding of the facts was reached.
adopted or approved.

He said that indicates

We think it indicates just the opposite.

They sat there for a long time —
QUESTION:

What about corrections?

Didn't he tell

us that some had been corrected, Mr. Friedman?
MR. FRIEDMANs

Well, I think if you look at that

excerpt
QUESTION:

What page are you on?

51
MR, FRIEDMAN:
Mr. Smalts asked was:

Page 92 of fche Appendix.

The question

Were they (the notes) occasionally read

back to you to see whether or not they correctly understood what
you were saying?
And the answer was:

Q, All right, sir.

Probably from time to time.
Did you either correct them or

say, "Yes, that9s right,” or "No, that's not right because it
went -this way, I believe," words to that effect?
And he said, Yes, that xvould happen.
Now, again, this may be subject to interpretation,
but I think the reasonable interpretation is that h© was not
correcting the words taken down by the prosecutors in the sens©
of adopting those words as his own, but he was saying, yes,
that's right certain facts happened that way or, no, it’s not
right, those facts didn't occur that v/ay.
QUESTION:

Have we any way of identifying from the

record precisely what notes were the subject of that, particular
colloquy?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

The only thing that we know that

they had to do with some of the notes taken on June 9’ and 10.
But, of course, he met with the prosecutors on May 13, June 9,
10, 16, 17, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 before h© ever
took the stand on direct, and then he met with them a number
of times before his rebuttal testimony.

So w® are talking

about one part of possibly two days' meetings with the

52
prosecutors in which there was a general verification of the
facts , the way I .read it* and not an actual adoption or
approval of fch® words.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, does the Department have

any particular procedure by which to signify approval- or
adoption, whether the interrogation is by an investigative
official or by a prosecutor?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don't believe so.

I think the

general policy is that adoption or approval means some sort of
a formal acceptance of the words comparable to initialing or
signature, but not necessarily initialing or signature, and

perhaps something more specific ought to exist.
QUESTION:

But there is nothing in this, initialing

or anything in hare?

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

In this work product , there is no

initialing or anything on the one that's before us.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

No signing, no indication that he ever

looked at the prosecutors' notes, and no reason why he would
look at the prosecutors8 notes.

There is nothing to indicate

that any of these pages, other than those that have now been
identified as his, were adopted or approved by him. in any way.

In fact, Mr. Smalts in his reply brief keeps referring, when h®
lists the categories of things, to information in the notes, but
he never calls them statements.

He lists six pages on which

53
there are direct quotations and there is a single thing in
quotation marks on each page, but even there we can't be entirely
sur® that they are Newman *s words. There may b© a paraphrase
that relates to conversations h« and other people had.
Mr. Smaltz says we have got this information.

But

He doesn’t call

them statements.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Newman was a lawyer,wasn3t h@?

MR. FRIEDMANs

Mr. Newman was a lawyer.

He had not

practiced law in some years, but hm was a lawyer.

And ha was

intimately familiar with fch® operation of “this insurance
company, and th© prosecutors having about three weeks to prepare
raided his education on things.
Let me just say one thing about the Brady question.
There seem to ba two Brady questions that he is raising.

On®

is that non-Jencks type material may nevertheless b© Brady
if it would be helpful in cross-examination; and we think the
answer to that is that unless it contains exculpatory things,
material* substantive kinds of evidence, it's not Brady, and h@
still hasn’t shown.
QUESTION?

But you concede that something that may not

be a statement within th© definition of the Federal statute
might still be producible under Brady, under th® Brady doctrine.
MR. FRIEDMANs

If Newman said Goldberg didn't do any

of these things teat X told you for three weeks he did, and
the. prosecutors just wrote a cryptic not®, teat would fo© Brady.

54
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR» FRIEDMAN:

But that's because it’s not being

turned over to try to impeach him with prior inconsistent
statements, but because it tends to show that he's not guilty.
QUESTION:
be Brady.

Or real evidence, tangible evidence,might

It wouldn't be a statement at all.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Somebody els©9s fingerprints on a gun,

or that sort of thing.
No, we are certainly not trying to limit Brady.

But

we sire saying -that Brady does not subsume Jencks and sort of
swallow it up.
His other point has to do with this plea agreement,
but h© cross-examined about

tha plea agreement.

He brought

out an awful lot. of evidence about the agreement, the nature of
it, what Newman expected from it, triad to show bias, and brought
out how much time he had spent with th© prosecutors, but
didn't always follow up on that.

H© got th® judge to give
V

instructions upon the car© with which accomplices' testimony
should be considered.

The judge instructed that Newman was

going to get probation, or at least that th© prosecutors ware
going to recommend probation.

And ©van now that h® has had

tha notes, he doesn't show how h® would have shown any mor®
with th® aid of the notes.

And, there is nothing in th© notes

that, relates to th© plea agreement.

Th© only thing it shows is

he spent a lot of time with the prosecutors and that Mr. Smalts

55

knew and was able to bring out»
We think that in this eas® there is absolutely no
legitimate claim to a new trial»

There is a legitimate claim

to a hearing in the Campbell sense and the question of the notes
handwritten by Newman.

We think that there need not be such

a hearing on the notes handwritten by the prosecutors if the
Court accepts our view that the terra "statement" and the terms
"(adopted" or "approved" must be Very narrowly defined, as
Congress intended, particularly whan prosecutors8notes —
QUESTIONS

That requires us to look at fch© papers.

MR. FRIEDMANs

It requires you to leaf through the

papers, because it’s pretty clear on its face that they are not
statements»
QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals if it had -- another

alternative for it would have been to say the work product basis
for the district court's ruling was unsound and we remand to
do this detail job itself.

But it didn't write any opinion;

it didn't tell us anything about these papers.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It did indicate they went through the

papers.
QUESTION:

All it said, they weren't statements.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, on fell© face of the papers it's

clear, except, as we say, in the case of the 7 pages handwritten
by Newman, that they are not statements.
QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. Friedman, on© of the

56

problems in -this statute from the beginning, this in camera
inspection, has been that parties argue these cases without
knowing anything about the materials and opinions can't be
written which disclose xvhat’s in the materials,,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It’s a silly

That's right.

But, of course, Palermo, I think, says, and you
would know better than I, that when it's clear that they are
statements,they are turned over; when it's clear
not statements, they are not turned over.

they are

It's in those

doubtful cases that you need an in camera, inspection.
QUESTION:

All I am suggesting is that lawyers corae

here and argue these cases? they don't know what they are
talking about, and we can’t tell them whafc they are talking
about, and yet we have to decide.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In this case Mr. Smaltz knows what he

is talking about because he has seen the papers.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Thanh you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smaltz.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD C. SMALTZ
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMALTZ:

I am going to take advantage of the

Court's offer of five more minutes,
I would like first to address myself to the fact
that, the Government contends that \m did not renew our motion

57
for the statements of the prosecutors of Mr,, Newman3s conversa­
tions at the time Newman testified in rebuttal»

I don't know

how many times we have to make a request, but the trial judge
cut us short and said there is an attorney work productexception, and I submit that we would have taken a significant
chance of arousing Judge Copple’s ire if after having had the
motion denied three times,we would have coma up again with the
same request just because Newman is on rebuttal»
Secondly, at the beginning of the trial on May 15 —
QUESTIONS

What you would have been requesting, you

say, then, on rebuttal had you simply renewed your earlier
reguest would have been prosecutors’ notes, because I take it
Judge Copple wouldn’t haves overruled on the same basis a request
for a statement, narrative statement,.of the witness Newman.
MR. SMALT’S:

I do not believe he would if fch®

government had told him that they exist, because on May 15,. Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, before the trial began — this is not
covered in the brief, but it appears in the record.'

At page

A-S9 of the reporter’s transcript the judge entered what might
b® referred to as a continuing order for 'the government to
turn over all Jencks Act statements.

Judge Copple ordered

the government on May 15, before the trial began, to produce
every document which it had in its possession or as it gains
possession thereof, to produce copies of them"for you"(referring
to me, because i had made this motion}, for the defendant.

58
That is, every document that is to be used in presentation of
the governraent1s case, all Jencks Act statements of witnesses
who will or may be called will be delivered to the defendant
by tomorrow.
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTS:
QUESTION:

This is in the appendix?
No, sir, it is not.,
It*s not in th® record?

It is in the

record.
MR. SMALTS:

It is in the record, but it's not in

the appendix.
QUESTION:
MR. SMALTS:
pages A-99 .

Not in the appendix.
It's in the reporter's transcript at

I believe that it was th® intent of Judge Copple

to have the government turn over to the defense all Jencks Act
statements.

But Judge Copple had no way of knowing and the

defendant had no way of knowing of th® fact Newman was writing
these statements, and there was no way for that fact to come
to the attention of anybody unless the prosecutor fulfilled its
duty and called that fact to the attention of the court.

They

did not do so.
QUESTION;

Why did you move three times during the

trial, then, for Jencks Act statements if Judge Copple had
already entered an order prior to trial requiring the government
to turn -them over?
MR. SMALTSs

Well, I moved three times because I

✓

59'

believed that Mr.vLebowitz had taken notea which constituted
>

Jencks Act statements,, and I believed that the prosecutor did
not feel that that complied, or that those notes were Jencks
Act statements.
During the direct examination of Mr. Newman, even
sitting away at counsel table.,, I could observe that the
prosecutor was reading from a document that was handwritten out
and rather detailed, and I wasn't craning my neck to see that
because there was a huge book that th© prosecutor had on his
desk, and that's what prompted me initially in my cross“
examination to ask those questions about attorneys5 notes.
Further, 1 would like to invite th© Court's attention
to pages 5 and 6 of our reply brief because the second reason
that I asked about attorneys! notes was that Newman, while h©
was committed to having mads a complete statement to the
government by the terms of the plea agreement only made a
partial statement, and I knew that somewhere along h© had to
fulfill that requirement to th© government, and I thought it
was odd that a reporter wasn't present.

And on pages 5 and 6

of our reply brief we attempt to analyze why that agreement in
and of itself makes th® attorneys’ notes compellable.
I would like to say on© more thing, and that is that
the government argues the legislative history, demonstrates that
Congress intended to shield prosecutors' trial notes from
production.

Our review of the legislative history of Congress'

60
enactment of the Jencks Act, which was cited in the government's
brief, discloses no such concern for attorneys' notes, but does
disclose a concern for the witness in questioning a witness
about a statement he never saw or whose language he never
adopted or approved»
Now, the congressional attempt with respect to th©
meaning of adoption or approval we agree is not precisely set
forth in the legislative history.

Nonetheless, the thrust of

the provision was to ensure that unless the defendant had in
some way been informed of statements attributed to* hirhNand has
indicated his approval of their accuracy, th© summaries should
not be turned over to the defense.

But in th© context of this

case, for the reasons that we set forth at pages 6 and 7 of our
reply brief, Newman was committed to giving an accurate
statement and the prosecutors were committed to receiving an
accurate statement.
For the reasons we have expressed in our briefs and
here at oral argument, we respectfully submit that petitioner's
conviction should be reversed and a new trial ordered.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:19 a.m„, oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.]
