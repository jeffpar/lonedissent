MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We9IX hear arguments next

in 6212, Norton against Mathews.
Mr. Brown.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRISTOPHER BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BROWN?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court ?
Counsel for all parties in this case and the next
case, Mathews va. Lucas, have discussed the following matter
and wa agreed to suggest to the Court that during the Norton
hour wa discuss jurisdictional issues and during the Lucas
hour we discuss the merits.

And wa will, if there is no

objection to that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We'll try not to have any

questions that cross that division.
You may proceed, Mr. Brown.
MR. BROWN?

All right.

Thank you.

In 1969 Gregory Norton, Jr., then age 5 years old,
applied for child's insurance benefits to the Social Security
Adminis tration.
Title II of the Social Security Act allows children
whose fathers have become disabled, have reached a certain age,
or who have died, and whose fathers worked and were covered by
Social Security employment for a requisite number of quarters,

4
to receive death benefits — at least death benefits in the
Norton case — upon their death.
Gregory Horton applied for these benefits.

He

applied for these benefits after his father was killed in the
Vietnam War.
Gregory is illegitimate,,

His mother and his fattier

were not married.
Now, the Act is so structured — and I’ll just touch
on this briefly# because it’s not totally relevant to the
jurisdictional argument ~ but the Act is so structured that
most other children who are applying for child’s insurance
benefits have to# in addition to several not very controversial
prerequisites# have to establish that ‘they indeed are the son
or the daughter of the wage-earner? i.e.# have to establish
paternity.
How# Gregory Norton’s class has to establish another
fact.

They also have to establish# in addition to paternity#

that they were either living with or supported by the deceased
wage-earner at the time he died.
Gregory Norton filed a cause of action in the
federal district court to challenge the constitutionality#
under the Fifth Amendment equal protection concepts# of that
provision.
The suit was filed in the United States District
Court for Maryland.

In that suit there were various juris-

5

dictional bases asserted”.

28 U.S.C. 1331, APA jurisdiction?

mandamus jurisdiction, 1361? and also jurisdiction under the
Statutory Review Procedures, 42 U.S.C. 405(g).
The suit was also classed or stated to be a class
action.
The United States District Court, in its initial
opinion, held in its opinion that a class was to be certified.
But on the merits it ruled against the Norton claim by a
three-to-nothing vote? a three-judge district court.
An appeal was then taken from that adverse decision
to this Court.

This Court. — shortly after this Court decided

the Jimenez cas®, Weinberger vs8 Jimenez, or Jiwanes; vs.
Weinberger, actually — remanded this case back to the threejudge court for reconsideration in light of the Jimenez case.
On remand, the three-judge court, this time by a
two-to™one vote, upheld the constitutionality of the statutory
provision that Gregory Norton is attacking.
An appeal was 'then brought again to -this Court, and
that's where we are today.
Incidentally, there is another issue that has now
bean waived by Gregory Norton, and that is an issue that he
indeed was in fact supported, and therefor© met the prerequisite
of the Act.
Norton.

That decision was decided adversely to Gregory

He waives.

He has not appealed that issue.

His only

issue in this case, in addition to the jurisdictional issue,

6
is whether or not the Act is constitutional.
Because if it's not, then he doss not have to
establish -that he was either supported by or resided with the
deceased wage-earner father.
This case can only come to this Court if it comes
from a properly convened three-judge courtr in the District
of Maryland.
We are alleging jurisdiction in tills Court now
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1253.

That statute requires, in turn,,

that review can only be had from decisions of a properly
convened three-judge district court granting or denying
injunctive relief.
Accordingly, we are properly here if the three-judge
court in tills css© properly had the power to issue an
injunctive relief, and a kind of injunctive relief that would
seek to stop enforcement of the statuta.
This, we contend, it did have the power to do, and
this basically is the core argument on the jurisdictional
issue in this case.
We have two major routes by which we think this
Court, through either on© of which this Court could get to the
final solution 'that there indeed is injunctive power in the
district court.
On® route is by looking at Section 20.5(g) of the
Social Security Act, which is 42 U.S»C. Section 405(g)» and

7

that’s the provision of the Act which was highlighted in this
Court’s recent decision in Weinberger vs, Salfi? either by
looking at that statute itself and getting it from the words
of that statute, or from how that statute should be inter­
preted in light of the general statutory interpretation ru3.es
that apply in the situation*
Or, secondly, if 205(g) cannot do it by itself, we
contend that the APA gives the power to — for a Federal
District Court, if not given the power explicitly by the
Statutory Review statute to injunctive relief, sort of is an
ancillary remedy to what is provided by the Statutory Review
section*
QUESTIONS

But in order to get in under the APA you

have to show that the statutory remedy otherwise provided is
inadequate, don’t you?
MR, BROWN: That is true,
That is true, and I hope to be able to point that
out today.
First, the general presumption which seems to run
throughout the cases that this Court has decided this century
is that,barring an explicit declaration by Congress to the
contrary, there is a general presumption of reviewability,
Now, also, I think the cases can be read to establish
there’s a general presumption that a District Court, which is
an equity court, has broad equitable powers,

/

8
Now, admittedly, each case that has been decided
thus far deals with a specific agency? and, as would be
expected, th© words of each statutory .review provision for
each other agency are not the same as we encounter in this case.
Accordingly, I admit that there is no case right on
point.

But there are many cases which seem to not be limited

in any way and accordingly would be applicable to this
situation.
So, basically, we are beginning our argument on the
assumption that there is a general presumption that a court of
equity, which the United States District. Court is now, a
combination of law and equity, can grant all relief that is
necessary to snake the parties whole? unless Congress has
specifically said that they cannot.
205(g) of the Social Security Act, as is pertinent
to this case, merely says the followings

That the district

court, after certain prerequisites have bean met, which
Gregory Horton has mat in this case, the district court shall
have th® power to affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of
the Secretary.
And we contend that 'there is nothing in those three
words which in any way indicates a congressional intent to
negate injunctive relief in this case.-

If anything, perhaps

the word “reversal" could be read to include the power to
issue reverse by injunctive relief.

9
QUESTION; Well,. Isn’t, though, perhaps the more
accurate question to ask is whether the injunctive authority
that, as you say, is generally available to the district
courts, is in any way necessary to carry out what a statute -what this statute requires the district court to do?
I mean, can't it fully accomplish what Congress has
intended that it do by simply setting aside the decision of
the Secretary?
MRo BROWN;

Okay.

1*11 move on to 'that point right

now, Your Honor»
If we look at how the Act works and how, in
practicality, the needs of people litigating in this area,
the needs of claimants who are attempting to obtain Social
Security benefits, we see on two different levels that there
are very many practical needs as to why a claimant actually
does need injunctive relief as opposed to any other kind of
relief.
Now, I think if we look at those needs and imagine
what Congress must have imagined

indeed, Congress has not

said very much on this issue? we are basically not working
with, any explicit statutory history — we look at the needs for
injunctive relief, I would submit that Congress could in no way
have intended to not allow a court, an equity court, to
issue injunctive relief.
First of all, on the individual basis ~~ I look at

10

tills on an individual basis and on a classwide baside — on
an individual basis, when an individual claimant receives a
benefit, there is no necessary guarantee that he is going to
be paid that benefit in a proper fashion, and indeed there
may be cases when that individual xnay want to be abla to gat
benefits before a final judgment is issued? i*e„, he may want
to apply to a court for preliminary injunction or something
such as that, to give benefits, before the District Court has
finally decided the ultimate merits of the case *
Here's an example where that could be very helpful*
In this Lucas case, for instance, the oldest Lucas
daughter, past the ag© of eighteen —* she’s now past the age
of eighteen? you cannot get these benefits if you're past
eighteen, unless you're still in school — now, in her case,
she couldn’t still b© in school unless she had the money not to
have to work*

So in many individual cases there may be an

instance in which the prerequisites of a preliminary injunc­
tion have been met by an individual party? and, for instance,
in this situation, where you have someone who has strong need
for the benefits, it could very clearly be a situation in which
they could establish the various equities and so forth to get
a preliminary injunction*

That would be one kind of injunctive

relief*
But, admittedly, -that would not be the kind of
injunctive relief you need in order to have a three-judge court,

11
That wouldn't enjoin enforcement of the statute*
QUESTIONs Wall, would that injunction be very useful
if the case was on review?

Isn't it very likely that if we

decided to take the case - that that would be enough, also, to
suggest the likelihood of a stay of the injunction until the
merits were decided?
So, how would that get any money in the pocket of
the recipient?
MR. BROWNs Well,then the government would have to
come in and either — and fight against the preliminary
injunction motion, and they would balance the equities in that
situation? they'd either win or they’d lose.
Or, if the decision was issued favorably to the
individual claimant, the way normal cases work, that claimant
gets the fruits of their victory at that point? unless -the
other side comes in and requests a stay pending appeal.
QUESTIONt
MR. BROWNs
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN;

Well, isn't -that very often the case?
Indeed, that is the case.
Yes,
But, for instance, another case that

was here on summary affirmance is Griffin vs, Richardson.

In

that case the three-judge court held another provision of the
Social Security Act unconstitutional, as violating illegitimate
children's righfcs.
The government came in and asked for a stay pending

12

appeal.

They said $50 million was going fco have to be paid

out? that’s too much.

Let’s wait and see what the Suprema

Court does.
The three-" judge court unanimously denied their
request for stay pending appeal, and,,Mr, Justice Burger, you
affirmed that denial.
Benefits were paid out by the Social Security
Administration, or at least the process was begun before this
Court summarily affirmed that decision.
Mow, that’s just on© situation, and each case would
have to b© decided on its own individual merits,
I think there's raven more.

The more important

reasons
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that because when the stay

application is presented at this level, that an evaluation is
made of the probabilities?
MR, BROWN:

Indeed,

You'd have to show a strong

QUESTION:

It’s a little difficult to generalise

lack of —

about this, isn’t it?
MR, BROWN2

Oh, indeed? indeed.

You’d have to meet

a strong likelihood of success on the merits? the irreparable
harm would have to be significant? and the public interest
would have to b© in one’s favor? and it would have to not be
of significant harm to the government.

13

l°m assuming that those could b© met.

I mean, this

is — wesre.talking now about why injunctions ar® needed, and
we can't specifically talk about this case or that case.

QUESTIONS

Incidentally, may X ask — X gather

what — this is an argument, that there is this equity power
in the district court
MR« BROWNs This is correcta
QUESTION:

and that affirm, reverse# or modify

in no way reduced that power»
MR» BROWNs

That's correct»

QUESTION;

Or curtailment»

MR» BROWNs

That's correct.

QUESTION %

Is that it?

You're not malting an argument that one

may construe "affirm", "modify" or "reverse" — although you
did say earlier something about a reversal might, in some
instances, be tantamount to injunction -»
MR. BROWNs
QUESTION s

Yes »
But this is not an argument that any of

those words should fo© interpreted as embracing a power.
MR. BROWNs

You're correct, Your Honor.

Right now

I'm saying — I'm about to go to the policy reasons that
Congress would have had to go through themselves if ~
QUESTION;

Yes, but I just want to understand what

14
you're saying is that 'the power that on© usually has in an
equity court has not in any wise been curtailed by the language
used in 405(g)»
MR. BROWNi
QUESTIONS
MR. BROWN:

That, is correct.
All right.
That's ' my argument.

And when the language says nothing, we try to look to
other reasons as to what Congress might mean.

And now, looking

at these various actual needs the claimants might have, I think
this helps expos© son® of the reasons why Congress would not
have wanted to preclude injunctive relief.
The most important aspect of any case such as this
is an attempt to make everyone whole who has suffered under an
<0

unconstitutional provision ~~ in this case the Social Security
Act.

There's a need for prompt perspective enforcement — or

unenforcemanfc as the case may be, in this situation of the
illegal provision of the Act.

There's a need for retroactive

benefits to be paid, or at least the court would be asked for
that.
QUESTIONs

I presum© you're speaking with respect to

people who are parties to the litigation?
MR. BROWN:

I'm speaking — well, with respect to

retroactive benefits, I'm talking about 'the parties, -the named
plaintiffs in the litigation, as well as a class.
QUESTION:

A class consisting of people who had ma.de

15
claims -bo the Secretary and who had made them within sixty
days?
MR. BROWN;

That.5s correct, Your Honor.

Who have

applied for benefits, who have been denied benefits solely
because of this specific provision that the rest of the class
is litigating, and who have filed their request for benefits
or their appeal to the district court no later than sixty
days, or perhaps we would contend later on that there's a
tolling effect, and that Gregory Norton in effect tolled the
statute of limitations for this class,
QUESTION; Well, even if they hadn't applied for
benefits within sixty days, if they were to bo members of a
class, 1 suppose the class member filing might foe tantamount
to a filing for them.

But at least 'blue class couldn’t embrace

people whose claims had been denied by the Secretary more than
sixty days before the class member filed.
MR. BROWN;
exactly correct.

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

And we don't ask for anything broader than a

class that would be defined as you just defined it,
Without injunctive relief, there's really nothing
that can be done in tern® of making everyone whole.

The Act

itself is now structured so that the individual claimant can
be mad® whole.
whole.

But there's nothing which makes everyone

All those illegitimate children in this case who have

applied for benefits, but have bean denied benefits because

16
thay couldn’t reaet the specific requirsmants of the Act that
are being -challenged in this case.
I think Congress

I cannot imagine that Congress

would have wanted t© preclude any district court from making
the whole class whole# after a court had decided that 'the
provision under which the whole class was denied benefits was
un cons ti tuti on al.
QUESTION;

But can’t the court make that whole class

whole simply by setting aside an order of th© Secretary with
respect to each member of the class?
MR. BROWNs

Well# what would be **- you’re saying

there’s another'word# other than Minjunction” # that would be
used to define what th© district court would do.

And that

would be setting aside?
QUESTION;
as I conceive it;

Wall# an injunction says to the Secretary#
this provision is unconstitutional and

you are barred from enforcing it# pariori»
Mow# it may b© cm forcible only by people who are
partias to this action.

But a setting aside is# at least I

would read 405 — would says

your order in this case is

invalid because it relied on an unconstitutional section of
the statute.

Therefore this claimant should be awarded

benefits.
MR. BROWN;

But could th® court also say that the

wholes class of claimants should be awarded benefits in the

17
same manner?
QUESTIONs Well, certainly, if the class were uniform,
properly a class, the court could say that the awards in each
of the cases ar© set aside*
MR. BROWN:

Okay.

I would have no difficulty —

the words “set aside”, I don’t believe are in the statute,
just as the word ’’injunction” is not in the statute.
QUESTION s

But that does involve

~ the basic

jurisdictional question, of this Court is that presumably that
could be done by a single judge in a Federal District Court*
MR. BROWN:

I understand that, Your Honor.

I understand —
QUESTION;

Now, on the other hand, if the holding

were, as ray brother Rehnquist suggests, that the statutory
provision upon which the Secretary relied was unconstitutional,
then I suppose there would still be direct appeal to this
Court under th© other statutory provision — 1252, wouldn’t
tli® re?
MR. BROWN;

That’s correct, and that’s one of th© --

QUESTION;

But, of course, in this case, the holding

was the opposite way;

on the merits...

MR* BROWN;

That’s correct.

QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

MR. BROWN;

Now, the problems that I have with

getting relief, making the class whole by something not called

18
an injunction? but? instead called setting aside the decisions
of the Secretary for a whole class? are as follows?
There's often a need to assure so» degree of
promptness in what the Social Security Administration does.
Social Security dees not necessarily act as promptly as perhaps
they ought to act.

An injunction is something which enables

people to act a bit more promptly and enables the attorneys
for toe people who have received toe favorable order to assure
that prompt action will be carried out.
Also? 1 think that»? many times? clarifications are
needed.

The Secretary does not wilfully disobey orders ? but

sometimes there's an ambiguity as to what an order means.
Experience has at least shown ms that if you have an
injunction? which is ordering anybody to do something? that
much more readily assures prompt resolution of any ambiguity
that might arise.
Another factor which would con-pel that there be an
injunction?rather than? say? just a setting aside or nothing
at all? is that with something that would be termed just
setting aside the decision of the class? you ineffect are
assuming that the Secretary has lost and the claimant class
has won? are giving the Secretary an automatic stay pending
appeal.
I don't think Congress would have intended that the
Secretary necessarily gets an automatic stay pending appeal.

19

QUESTION : Wall,, why do you think Congress than chos©
this particular language affirming, modifying or reversing
tha order of the Secretary as the raethod by which the Secretary9
decision war© to be judicially reviewed?
MR. BROWN: Well, 18hi not —- it seems to b© the
primary method by which the Secretary's decisions are to be
reviewed.

I have argued in my brief that there can be other

methods also.

For instance, we're talking about the Act,

205(h) talks about decisions of the Secretaryc

And there could

b@ a very good argument that this is not a decision of the
Secretary -that we're challenging, but it's a decision of the
Congress, citing Johnson va. Robison.
QUESTION:

And «-

Well, weren't a lot of these doubts that

you're suggesting pretty well resolved in the Salfi opinion?
And didn't — I haven't got it before ms, but didn't the
Salfi opinion say just that, that ‘this is the method by which
Congress has chosen that the Secretary's decisions be reviewed,
and that a decision such as this is the decision of tha
Secretary, not of tha Congress: — of the Secretary7, within the
meaning of the statute?
MR. BROWN:

Let roe say this:

It appears as if ~~

I've read Salfi ad nauaeum —* it does not seem to have anything
QUESTION t How many readings did that take?'
[Laughter.]
MR. BROWN;

Salfi does not indicate, in any way —

20
except with on© slight exception. which 1*11 touch upon —
that, for instance, there is no way in which you can get
injunctive relief.

Sajj.fi didn't need to decide that issue,

because Salfi had a different circuitstance.
Salfi

says nothing that «—* for instance, part of the

APA, Section 703 and 704 of th® APA give ancillary power to
issue injunctive relief.

Salfi doesn't touch upon that.

I don't think — ©van if we assume that 205(g) is
the only way that we can get revisw in this case — that does
not preclude injunctive relief, because that does: not preclude
<

relying upon th© ancillary APA remedial powers.
There is nothing in Salfi, and there is nothing in
205(g) or 205(h) which in any way precludes that, to th©
bast of my knowledge.

And there is language in 205(h) which sayss

In

order to get review under this Social Security provision,
you have to follow all the portions of the Act.
And by the class that I have suggested be defined,
the class, by definition, would have followed all portions

of the Act.

We ar© exhausting

which is one of the things

Salfi requires — we will file -an application — which Salfi
requires.

1 can see nothing inconsistent with what we're

asserting her® and Salfi.
QUESTION?

Wall, you don't ~• you aren't suggesting,

though, that 'th© district court would have power to enjoin th©

21
operation of the Act of Congress generally, against anybody.
Isn’t it enough for you to say that it is not inconsistent with
the judicial review provisions for the Court to, in effect,
enjoin the operation -- to set aside the award or to set
aside the denial of the award on the ground that the Act is
uncons titutional?
You are enjoining the operation of the statute to
that extent»
MR, BROWNX
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s all I -~
Isn’t that enough for

that’s all you

need to say, isn’t it?
MRo BROWN;

That is enough.

I’m talking about 'these

hypothetica is merely to try to dispel the notion -that Congress
could have intended ‘there to be no injunctive power at all,
I’m not

these hypothetical are not necessarily in this

case, but what you said is correct,
QUESTION 2 But do you think that the setting aside a
judgment of the Secretary is

on tine ground that the Act he

acted under is unconstitutional? does that amount to an
injunction?
MR, BROWN:

I think it amounts to an injunction if

there’s the same bite that that order would have which an
injunction has, which means that something has to begin
happening now.

Payments have to start to be made now.

payments would have to be made to -the whole class.

And

22

If that's what the setting aside entails and implies,.
I think it's tantamount to an injunction.
QUESTION!
MR. BROWNs

Well, what does it imply?
Well, I presume

Justice Rehnquist

has suggested this, and I — it would seem that if you use the
words "set aside" and treated them like an injunction, -there
ara casas that this Court established -that you have to -then
have a 'three-judge court.
We don't •»“ you generally look at what the remedy
does as opposed to the name attached.
QUESTION5

Well, the Secretary acts; under a

statute and says your claim is denied, because the statute
bars you..

The Court says that, statute is unconstitutional,

you cannot bar him for that reason.

Your order is set aside.

Now, the Act of Congress is not being — the Court
is refusing to apply an Act of Congress in that particular
case, I take it; and is telling the Secretary, "don't enforce
that statute."
MR. BROWN!

You're saying an individual order to

set aside a case would in effect be stopping the enforcement
of an Act?
QUESTION:

Well, I mean the statute says an injunctions

restraining the enforcement or the operation of a statute as
well as the «—
MRn BROWN:

I understand your point, and 1 would

23
agree with that point..
QUESTION 2
unfortunate.

The term 15set aside” is probably

I think "reverse", which is the statutory

language, would accommodate the same questions.
MR. BROWN;

That's quite probable.

My suggestion would be that that would be tantamount
to an injunction.
QUESTIONs

Well, wait a minute.

Now you’re saying

"reversed" is tantamount to what?
MR. BROWN? Your Honor, I think — if pressed to my
hardest argument, I would say that "reverse" includes to give
injunctive relief or that kind of «—
QUESTIONs
MR. BROWN s
QUESTION:

All right.
I don't think I'm pressed to that point.
Well then, does it follow that a three™

judge court would be required to do it?
*

MR. BROWNs

Yes, Your Honor.

If the reversal was

tantamount to an injunctioii and operated like an injunction,
and restrained enforcement of the statute,’a three™judge court
would be required.
This is a unique way of approaching it, and I had
approached it under conditional ways which would make it a
little clearer as to what was happening, and therefore whether
a -three™ judge court was necessary or not.
I’d like to reserve whatever time I have left, if

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR» JONES:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The United States takes the position in this rase
that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal»
Our contentions in this regard may be summarized by
the following five points s
First, appellant's individual claim for relief did
not require the convening of a three-judge district court.
Second, the district court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction over the class designated by the appellant.
Third, although the district court may have
possessed subject matter jurisdiction over a far more narrowly
defined class of claimants, a suit on behalf of that class
would not be cognizable under the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
Fourth, even if such a class action were cognizable
under the Rules, the class would nevertheless have been unable
to assert a substantial claim for injunctive relief, and,
therefore, under no circumstances would a three-judge court
have been required to hear that case.

25
and fifth, finally, sine© a three-judge court was
not required, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.
I will now elaborate upon those points.
I begin the analysis by distinguishing between
Appellant’s individual claim and th® claim fox' class relief»
I will first take up th® jurisdictional aspects of
appellant’s individual claim for relief, and then discuss the
implications of his request for certification of the action
as a class action.
Appellant’s suit on his own behalf was brought to
review, a decision of th© Secretary, denying him child’s
insurance benefits.

As such, that suit was governed by -the

second sentence of Section 205(h) of the Social Security Act.
That sentence provides in essence -that no decision of the
Secretary shall be reviewed by any court except as provided by
Section 205(g) of th© Act.
In turn. Section 205(g) requires exhaustion of
administrative remedies by restricting the district court’s
jurisdiction to the review of final decisions mad© by th®
Secretary, after a hearing, and within sixty days prior to the
filing of the complaint.
Now, it’s conceded h@r@ that Appellant did exhaust
his administrative remedies, and that the district court
concedediy had subject matter jurisdiction over his claim.
Our contention, however, is that the district court

26

did not hav© jurisdiction to grant Appellant's request for
individual injunctive relief.

Section 205(g), as has been made

clear, confers on the district courts power only to, and I
quote from the statute, 55enter a judgment affirming, reversing
or modifying ill© decision of the Secretary'8, end of quote*
QUESTIONs

And then it's b©@n suggested that if an

individual claimant appeals the Secretary's decision, after
having exhausted his administrative remedies, asks for review
of that in a district court, upon the ground that the statutory
provision upon which the Secretary relied

in denying the

claim, is an unconstitutional provision, that that is the
functional equivalent of requesting a district court to enjoin
that statutory provision, and therefor© a three-judge court
is required.
That's what I understood the answer of your brother
to be to my last question before h© sat dowsu
\

MR, JONES?,

Well, if his argument is that a reversal

of a denial of benefits on the grounds that the statutory
classification was unconstitutional is in fact an injunction, —
QUESTIONs

It’s the functional equivalent of an

injunction, he told us ~ he didn’t use that phrase, but
that's what X understood him to say,
MR, JONESs

Wall, it may have the same consequences

as an injunction as to the individual plaintiff, but it
certainly is not an injunction in the sense that Section 2282

27
of the Judicial Cod® refers to injunctions.
It does not disrupt the operation of the Act in its
entirety as to all persons,
QUESTION2
is.

Well, it depends on how big the class

At least it might disrupt it with respect to the entire

class,
MR, JONES s

That is a question I was going to

reserva until I <»'~
QUESTION:

At least in that judicial district,

MR, JONES:

Well, the district judges in that court

might disagree, but ~~
QUESTION:

Which is all the effect that an injunction

could have.
MR, JONES:

But it’s certainly true that if a district

court or a court of appeals, exercising purely legal and non»
equitable powers, holds a statute unconstitutional, that is
the law for that district or that court of appeals, that
circuit.
Nevertheless, that has never been considered to foa
the kind of injunctive relief that requires a three™judge
court.

Donkey Walker.

Well, I think that —
Is that right or not?

MR, JONES s

I did not think that was right,

of a reversal of the denial of benefits to him, then that
plainly is not,

Whit©!.
QUESTION 3
QUESTION s

Donkey Walker.
Unconstitutional as applied.

QUESTIONS And yet if he gets a declaratory judgment
expressing that precise same proposition of law, it does not

QUESTION?

That's true, even if you declare it invalid

on its face.
QUESTION s

Yes.

QUESTION?

But

so that's not really involved.

Is tills any different from the Donkey Walker
situation?

Where this statute has just not been permitted to

be applied in tills case.
MR. JONESs

And the argument is that, even though,

as in Lucas, for example, it may bs a reversal; nevertheless,
it is a reversal that is equivalent to an injunction.

I mean

that — one of these cases -- in on© of these cases this
Court lacks jurisdiction.
QUESTION?

Well, -the Secretary's decision goes out

the window and may not be enforced because the statute is
unconstitutional

30

MR. JONES; As to this individual.
But that is not the kind of injunction that prevents
the Secretary from — excuse ms.

A decision by ids© district

court reversing th© denial of benefits, as in Lucas, is not
the kind of decision that disrupts the operation of the Act
as to other parties.
And our point here is that as to the individual,
I'm only now discussing th© individual aspect of the case,
there was no power to grant injunctive relief.

All that

the Court could do was reverse the decision of ‘the Secretary,
and that reversal is not the kind of injunctive disruption
with th© operation of the Act that warrants th© convening or
requires th,© convening of a three-judge district court.
QUESTION;

Well, you have restated your position.

QUESTION; Well, if you ware going to analogize th.©
reversing becausa th© section was unconstitutional to some
other form of more traditional relief than that contemplated
in 405, couldn’t you just as easily analogis® it to a declara­
tory judgment as to an injunction?
MR. JONES;

Well, I think it would be more

accurately — well, when there is only one plaintiff involved,
really, it seems to me, w© are in large part playing with
words, because whether it's more closely analogizable to a
declaratory judgment or an injunction or simple reversal of
th® denial of benefits, -the effect is the same.

And it seems

31

to me that if this Court is to construe any request to deny ~~
to reverse a decision of an administrative agency on the ground
that it is the application of an unconstitutional statutory
provision, the Court construes ©very such request as a request
for a three“judge court injunction.

And the jurisdiction of

three*”judge courts is going to ba enormously expanded.
QUESTIONs

Which runs against the grain of

numerous decisions of this Court? saying that -that statute
should be very narrowly construed?
MR. JONESs
QUESTIONS

Right?

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Mr. Jones, am I correct in understanding

-*■“ I suppose it!s obvious ~ the district court here is
exercising original jurisdiction rather than appellate
jurisdiction, is it not?
The word "reverse" is somewhat unusual for a
district court.
MR. JONES:

Although idler© are many circumstances

in which a district, court, in affect, has review authority
over administrative agencies.
QUESTION: But the order when it's changed is

the

district court doesn't, in effect, enter an order for the
Secretary, it orders the Secretary to do something, doesn't
it?
MR. JONES;

Well, it reverses the decision of the

Secretary denying the benefits.

And I think that that is a

32

kind of appellate jurisdiction# although within the framework
of Article 111« since the administrative agency is not a court#
it is# of course# original jurisdiction for those* purposes.
QUESTIONS

Other than this statute# does the district

court have jurisdiction to reverse orders?

Isn't it ««*

aren't there traditional ways in which the district court
exorcistas original jurisdiction when it orders somebody to
do something?
MR» JONESs

I am not sure what the review provision

with regard to ether administrative agencies is»

I would

suspect that this is not an extraordinary form of granting
judicial review# ‘that it is relatively common to provide for
review by reversal.

But I'm not positive as to that.

But to summarise our position as to the individual
claimants
First# we believe that -there is no injunctive author­
ity as such# because the statute does not embrace it.
Secondly# that if the statute does in fact embrace
such injunctive authority# then, nevertheless# injunctive
relief would always fa© inappropriate as to an individual
/

claimant# because an individual claimant always has an
adequate remedy at law in the form of reversal of the denial
to benefits.

The individual claimant never needs an injunction,

Opposing counsel suggested tost he might n@®d
preliminary injunctive relief.

I would make two comments with

33

regard to that.
First, such preliminary relief would foa no more
appropriate here than it was in Samson v. Kennedy,, where it
was •— excuse me* Samson v. Murray» whore it was held that
the back pay act prevents injunctive relief on behalf of
individual federal employees who are seeking to avoid dis­
missal.
tod secondly, as opposing counsel has conceded,
preliminary relief of that kind is not the kind of relief
that would entitle the claimant to a three-judge district court.
Therefore, it is our view that if appellant is to
prevail in this cas®, he must establish that the class action
was appropriate.

That a three-judge court was required, if

at all — and we think not — only if the class action was
appropriate.

36

MR, JONES5

Let roe turn now to the question of the

propriety of class relief.

.And we being With the fundamental

proposition that the district court may entertain a class
action only if it has subject matter jurisdiction over the
claims of "the individual members of -the class.
Appellant contends here that subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of the class existed under either the
mandamus statute or the Administrative Procedure Act.
And we answer that contention# I believe, in full at.
pages 13 through 18 of our brief in this case.

1 would only

summarize our points with regard to that aspect of the case.
We point out there that first this Court in Salfi
rejected that contention.

The Court held that Section 205(h)

of the statute# th® third sentence of that provision, forecloses!
all non~Social Security Act sources of jurisdiction.
t

Secondly, we think the Salfi decision is plainly
correct, because it effectuates the clear congressional inten­
tion of restricting the — restricting Social Security suits
to cases in which the plaintiff, the claimant has exhausted his
administrativa remedies, as provided by Section 205(g).
And third, we point out that if the Appellant's
position with respect to the mandamus statute were accepted,
that would lead to results so anohalous as to be untenable,
because it would provide for jurisdiction only as to those
persons whose claims were the least ripe for adjudication.

37
Accordingly, for all these reasons, the only source,
the only possible source of subject matter jurisdiction over
the class was Section 205(g) .
by Section 205(g)

But the jurisdiction conferred

clearly did not extend to the claims of the

class designated by the Appellant.
Section 205(g)

confers jurisdiction only over suits

brought to review of final decision of the Secretary after a
hearing made within sixty days prior to the filing of the
complaint.
The Appellant, in his complaint, and the district
court in its opinion, defined the class far more broadly, to
include — and I quote here from the district court opinion —
"all of “those persons otherwise eligible for child's insurance
benefits who cannot qualify for such benefits, solely because
they cannot meet the requirement that they be living with or
supported by their father on the date of his death."

End of

quote.
That class embraces many individuals who had no right
to sue on their own behalf under Section 205(g).

And the

district court plainly had no subject matter jurisdiction over
the claims of that class.
Thus, our position is that here, as in «Salfi, the
designation of the class and the complaint was fatally deficient;,
the complaint contained no allegations that the class members
and I here quote from the Salfi opinion — "have even filed

38
an application with the Secretary, much less that he has
rendered any decision, final or otherv/ise.E!
For the government this is probably the most important
single point in this case.
The government's primary interest here is in obtaining
a reaffirmance of the Salfi holding, that the district courts
in Social Security cases may not award class relief to
individuals who do not, themselves, have a right to bring suit
under Section 205 (g).
The problems faced by the Social Security Administra»
tion in administering very broad and loosely defined classes,
or relief as to such classes, may in some cases be literally
insurmountable.

There is no statutory basis for awarding

benefits to such a class, and it should not be awarded.
The impropriety of the class designation in Salfi
was -the end of the matter. We think it should be the and of
the matter here as well.
The district court lacked jurisdiction over the class
Appellant sought to represent, and therefore was without power
to consider any request on behalf of that class, whether for
injunctive relief or otherwise.
It follows that the three^judge court was not
required to be convened, and this Court does not have juris­
diction.
Mow, with that said, as I understand Appellant’s

39
argument here, he seems to contend that the district, court in
fact had jurisdiction over a more narrowly defined class of
claimants.

And that the proper remedy, although he doesn't

expressly so state, may he to vacate the decision below and
remand it for recertification of the class.
I wotald like to take some time to explore the
rami'fieations of that suggestion.
It is true that as a purely technical matter, Section
205(g)

does appear to leave some room for possible joinder of

a very narrow class of plaintiffs, permits the district courts
to review 'the decisions of the Secretary, final decisions of
the Secretary, rendered after a hearing, within sixty days of
the filing of the complaint.

Thus Appellant’s redefined class

would presumably be those applicants for child’s insurance
benefits whose applications were denied on the same basis,
same grounds as Appellant's class, within sixty days prior to
the filing of Appellant’s complaint.
I would make two points with regard to such a class;
First, it is very unlikely that the certification of
such a class would be permissible under Rule 23 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.

This is so for two reasons.

First, Rule 23(a) (1)

requires the class to be so

numerous as to make joinder of individual plaintiffs impracti­
cable.

This requirement is not likely to be met by Appellant's

class.

Indeed, Appellant may be the only member of this class.

40

And if there are any other members, they are very likely to be
few in number.
Second, Rule 23(a)(3) requires that the individual
plaintiff’s claim be typical of those of the class.

That is

not the case here, and is not likely ever to be the case, or
very likely to be the case in the Social Security context.
Most suits for review, and this is true of Appellant’s
suit here, may or will turn upon the substantiality of the
evidence on which the Secretary's factual findings were based.
Appellant, for example, contested the Secretary's finding that
his father had not been living with or supporting him at the
time of death.
Similar factual claims might be made by every
disappointed claimant
QUESTIONs
MR. JONES:

that Appellant seeks to represent.
But he's abandoned that.
lie's abandoned it here, but that does

not bear upon the question of whether his class was properly
certifiable under Rule 23(a)(3).
QUESTION;

But couldn't all of those points be

decided by thp district court?
MR. JONES:

Well —

QUESTION:

Whether there’s a sufficient number in

the class?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

I would have thought --Whether there's a related interest.

41
MR. JONES:

I would have thought that since the

district court could not issue,, in our view, an injuction
against tha statute on behalf of the individual, that only if
the certification of the class was proper would there be any
substantial claim for injunctive relief that would have
warranted the convening of a three-judge district court»
QUESTION:

But I thought he was talking about that

suggestion to go back to sea if you can limit the claims»
MR. JONES:
suggestion.

Well, that, it seems to me, is his

What I am suggesting to the contrary is that if you

did that, if you followed that procedure, you would find that
there would be no class that could be certified if —
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

How can we be sure of that?
You can't be positive.

But what I am

suggesting —
QUESTION:

Well, then, why not let the district

court find out whether you are right or wrong?
MR. JONES:

Well, I have — I have no serious princi-

paled objection to that, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I think if the

procedure was to require the single-judge district court to
make all of these detenainations ab initio before convening
the three-judge court that that would be a perfectly appropriate
methodcf dealing with these cases.
QUESTION: Well, couldn’t: a single district judge
supposing the plaintiff in the position of Appellant here

42

files a claim, asks that it move as a class action on behalf
of all those whose claims were denied within the past sixty
days by the Secretary for the same reason as his was, couldn’t
he then, without necessarily asking for injunctive relief,
simply say that he wants all of those actions of the Secretary
set aside?
MR. JONES:

That is my next point, Mr. Justice

Rehnguist.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Oh, I'm sorry.
That's quite all right.

What I was

going to say ip that if you surmount all of these hurdles as
to the certification of the class, nevertheless, injunctive
relief is not appropriate as to that class.
What you would have is a class of a handful of
applicants for Social Security benefits, all of whom had two
claims, one, that the Secretary erred in finding that their
father had not contributed to their support or lived with them
at the time of his death; secondly, that, if the Secretary's
findings were correct, the statute was nevertheless
unconstitutional.
And what I am suggesting is that if you had —
QUESTION:

And then what you

want and therefore

MR. JONES:

What I'm suggesting is that —

QUESTION: Well, I know, but —
MR. JONES:

And therefore, the decision of the

43

Secretary in all of those cases should be reversed.
QUESTIONs

And not enforced.

MR. JONES: Well, Mr. Justice White, that, of course,
is the result of any case in which the decision is reversed.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Yes, has to be.
But it is not in order that it not be

enforced in the same sense than an injunctive order is.

Because

it is not subject to enforcement in the same method as an
injunctive order,
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, why do you assume the first

issue would be in every one of those cases?

Isn't it possible

the class could be composed of persons who had admitted -they
were not supported by their father, and did not live with them?
MR. JONES:

There are two possibilities.

I guess

one would be that a person who had no substantial claim to have
satisfied those statutory prerequisites "would, nevertheless,
bring suit for review,; or secondly, a person might abandon
whatever substantial claim he might have.
QUESTION: As the plaintiff did here.
MR. JONES;

That -- the consequence: of amalgamating

all of these individuals — and there may not be very many of
them -- in a single class would-be, in effect, if that approach
is followed, to require those individuals to waive whatever
factual claims they might have.
At any rate, it's difficult to conceive of how all

44
those factual claims are going to be litigated in this multiplaintiff suit for review of the .Secretary9s decisions.
QUESTION;

I thought that was the petitioner's

suggestion* that the class should be limited to those who are
going to the Constitution only.
MR. JONES:

I do not think he so limited it* and* if

so* that would be a further constriction of the class? and I
am not sure he would find — if he had any members in the class
to begin with* he would have even fewer now* I suspect.
QUESTION:

Well* I* for one* can't take your word

for that!
MR. JONES:

That’s —

QUESTION:

I would much rather have the court to

hear it.
MR. JONES:

Well* what I was suggesting* Mr. Justice

Marshall, is that there are general principles that might lead
the district court to reach that determination? but* furthermore!*
as Mr. Justice Rehnquist points out* even if you surmount all
those obstacles and certify a class composed of this small
handful of plaintiffs * nevertheless* injuctive relief* as such*
is net necessary*

because a reversal of the denial of benefits

is appropriate as to each and every one of the individual
claimants.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, just one other point:

If

your basic argument is correct* am I right in believing this

45
Court had no jurisdiction in the Jimenez case?
MR. JONES:

That’s correct.

The Court would have

erred in assuming jurisdiction in Jimenez.
QUESTION:

So that would just be an advisory opinion.

MR. JONES: Well, I think it would be the law of that
case, and, as a practical natter, the Secretary is going to
accept it as the rule of law that’s applicable in cases affecting
other applicants for those benefits.
In short, to summarise very briefly, this Court lacks
jurisdiction, and we ask that the appeal be dismissed.

MR. BROWN:

The class we're requesting in this case

is the same class that was foxmd in, well, I'll call it,
Jimenez II, to bs a fair a properly defined class, consists ui
people who would only be contesting this one constitutional
basis, consists of people who have filed applications for
benefits, consists of people who have met the exhaustion
requirements of 205 (g).

As what Mr. Justice Stevens suggested,

in what we call Jimenez II, the class could be tolled by tfca
filing of the initial complaint, so there would be a broad
number of people in the class.

I personally have five

clients who I think would be in the class right now.
It's a significant thing.

If there is a factual

issue as to numeracity, the best place for that to be decided
is in the district court.
The district court, incidentally, did not have the
benefit of this Court's Salfi opinion when it first encountered

47
t±iis case.
I think it's only fair that -the district court, if
we win on the merits , be given another chance to comply with
Sal.fi.

It wasn't able to do so, and Salfi was a surprise in

many ways.
I think this Court's decisions as to retroactivity and
soth forth are such that the district court deserves a second
chance to define and use the correct words in its class
definition.
I have nothing further.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
