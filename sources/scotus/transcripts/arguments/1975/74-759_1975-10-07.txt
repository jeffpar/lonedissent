OEM, ARGUMENT OF PAUL Lc FRIEDMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR.» FRIEDMAN s

Mr® Chief Justice * and may it pleas©

the Courts
This case is her© on & writ of certiorari to 'the
United States Court of Appeals for the District ©£ Columbia
Circuit*
The question is whether a physician — and it also
applies to other practitioners, including pharmacies —
registered under the Controlled Substances Act to prescribe
and dispense drugs for legitimate medical purposes is immune
merely because he in so registered from prosecution under
the section of the Act which prohibits the unlawful distribu­
tion of centred led substances*
The evidence at trial was overwhelming, that,
respondent was really no different from .any street-corner
drug pusher, and that he engaged in the indiscriminate sale
of prescriptions for profit, without really providing any
type of medical treatment for his so-called patients*

And

yet the Court of Appeals concluded that Congress intended to
exempt someone like respondent,because he was a doctor, from

4
penalties applicable to other traffickers in narcotic drugs =
In reaching this conclusion,, the District of Columbia
Circuit stands alone, because the First Circuit, the Fifth
Circuit., the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit and the Tenth
Circuit, and we -think by implication the Sixth Circuit, have
concluded that Congress intended to doctors, pharmacies,
hospitals, veterinarians and other practitioners who, after
all, have the greatest access to drugs and the greatest,
opportunity to divert them, were to be treated the same as
any other person whan they trafficked in narcotics*
Briefly, the facts are that respondent was indicted
at first on 639 counts, each involving a sale of a prescrip­
tion, but he went to trial on 40 counts, 30 ware presented to
the jury and they convicted him on 22 counts»
The evidence at trial showed that methadone, which
is the controlled substance involved in this ease, is a
synthetic narcotic drug, it*s a morphine substitute, and it
can be as physically and psychologically addictive as heroin

In fact, because it's cheaper and it*a often more,
readily available than heroin, some heroin addicts use it as
a substitute for heroin when they can’t get heroin,
But, at. the same time, under proper supervision and
control, it can be vary useful in th.es treatment of addicts,
either through detoxification or maintenance.

5
Detoxification* which is what respondent said he
was involved in here, involves giving fch© addict a large dose
of methadone at first, in order to keep him fra© from with­
drawal symptoms, and gradually reducing the dosage until he
obtains *>«* attains abstinence from all drugs.
Maintenance, on the other hand, really substitutes
methadone addiction for heroin addiction, a fixed dosage is
given for an indefinite period of time.
Now# respondent had run a detoxification program
in the District of Columbia in 1969# but he was ultimately
arrested for violating the Harrison Narcotics Act, an Act that
this Court said may be violated by physicians when they sell
prescriptions or drugs indiscriminately and not for a
legitimate medical purpose.
He promised at that time that in exchange for the
dismissal of charges# he promised thus Grand Jury that he
would change his ways in the manner in which he conducted his
program; that he would obtain medical histories from all of
his patients; that ha would conduct, reasonably thorough
physical examinations; that h© would abide by the results of
urinalysis, which can show whether or not there are narcotics
in the bloodstream; that he would record the times and tie
amounts of the dosages of methadone given? and that he would
either give the methadone at his clinic or he would prescribe
only so much as necessary for a daily dosage.

6

At trial in this case ha admitted that he did not.
follow these agreements3
In a five- and-one-ha 1 f-month period-, which is the
time involved in the indictment here, from September 1, 1971
to February XI, 1972, it is true that respondent was registered
under the Controlled Substances Act to conduct a methadone
detoxification program*

Ha did not give physical examinatione

to his so-called patientsj he did not take urine samples under
supervision? he ignored the results of his urine samples?
and he did not give th® methadone at his clinic and he did not
prescribe only a daily dosage„
Rather,» he sold prescriptions, and he charged, as
our brief indicates and as the record clearly shews , depending
upon th® amount of tablets prescribed*

If you got a 50-tablet

prescription, you’d pay $15? if you got a 75-tablet prescrip­
tion, you'd pay $25pay $35«

For a 100-tablet prescription, you'd

You could com® back as often as you wanted to*

Some of the witnesses testified they came back every day or
©very other day? a few cam© back on occasion more than once
in a single day,
QUESTION?

Did he fill th© prescriptions himself?

MR* FRIEDMANs

No, what he did was he wrote out the

prescription for whatever amount you wanted and you paid for
the prescription*

You then went to a drug store and had the

prescription filled, and paid again for the druggist's fee.

7
There were three particular drug stores involved
here,, none of which wera charged with any criminal offenses,,
but the Ilf000 prescriptions filled in this period were all
filled at these particular drug stores
QUESTIONS

So his escalating rat© for ’fee difference

in numbers in the prescription couldn * it be attributed to fee
filling of fee prescription by him,
MR* FRIEDMAN:

That's right, it had nothing to do

with the cost of the particular tablet,,

It. wan the cost of

him writing 100 rather than 50 feat was involved*
In five and a half months he sold prescriptions for
800,000 dolophine tablets, which is a form of methadone# and
he took in over a quarter of a million dollars,
H® gave no treatment
QUESTIONS

Over what period?

MR, FRIEDMANs

A five-and-one-half-month period,

from September ©£ *71 to February of f72 whan ha was closed
down®
QUESTION?,

How did that relate to the appearance

before the Grand Jury?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

The appearance before, the Grand Jury

was back in *69, when ha promised to make «« to change his
form of treatment, and for a time he apparently did, or at
least was not detected if he did not*
And he did have a registration to engage in defcoxifi-

cation# but then in ’71 it. cam© to the attention of the
authorities that h© was not foilwing these promises; and#
through the use of undercover agents and otherwise# they found
that he was not doing any of the things that he premised that
he would do,

And so he was arrested# closed down# and

indicted in these 633 counts«
There was some feeling# I gather# that — back in
*63# 'that because detoxification could be useful if properly
run and supervised .and controlled# that Dr, Moore should be
given a chance to do it under proper conditions because h©
could make a contribution to the community# in helping
addicts«
But# apparently# as the evidence showed at trial#
that was not hie ..desire or intention at all» because, less
than two years later# he was ■»«*
QUESTIONS

Mr, Friedman# wasn’t all that agreed to

in tli© Court of hpp®k\s?
MR» FRIEDMANs

All these facts?

Absolutely# Mr,

J us tic© Mars hall.,
QUESTIONS

I was wondering about the time ha spent

and all®
MR® FRIEDMANs Well# I think it’s important to put
this in a proper factual context# and to show# really# how
Congress could not possibly have intended that people that
engage in this kind, of egregious conduct should be exempt from

9

felony prosecution for distributing or selling narcotics»
Congress was well aware of the potential for abuse, the
dangers that treatment programs have, the fact that doctors
&r© the largest source, doctors and pharmacies, of diversion
of drugs into illicit channels
And they could not possibly, in light of the opinions
of this Court, have intended, without ever saying so, to have
exempted physicians, because the law was clear at the time
they enacted the Controlled Substances Act that physicians
were covered by the old Harrison Narcotics Act, and wa don’t
think that, given what Congress knew, they by their silence
intended to exempt physicians»
QUESTIONS Well, 1 gather the Court of Appeals
conclusion was, admitting all these things that you say the
doctor did, that, nevertheless, he couldn’t be prosecuted
for violation of this statute but for any, it would have to
b® for noncompliance with the provisions governing his
registration under 822, wasn’t that it?
MR» FRIEDMANS
QUESTIONS

Yea, well, ~~

I moan, isn’t that essentially what the

Co-art -«»
MR. FRIEDMANi

Essentially what the Court of Appeals

said is that, that he could only be prosecuted under 842,
or possibly 843, if ha did things like — that were covered
by that statute»

842(a)(1) ie what tha Court of Appeals

10

particularly referred to, which is a statute which proscribes
someone **« which makes it originally a civil penalty, unless
you do it knowingly —• to distributa or dispense controlled
substanees without the prescription of 829«
Mow, Judge MacKinnon, in his dissent, said that if
you*re not prescribing for legitimate medical purpose, then
it*s not really a prescription, and therefor® you could be
punished under 842(a) (1).
We*re not so sure that it's not a prescription.
still looks like a prescription*

A pharmacist sees it.

It
He

relies upon it* And h® prescribes«
But perhaps more importantly than that, legislative
history and the whole statutory scheme makes clear that 842
and to sons extent 843 really intends to get at the kinds of
technical violations of a registration scheme.

And the

anomaly is that if he writes a prescription, as Dr* Moore did,
ha may be punishable under 842(a) (1), but if he gives away
drugs indiscriminately, the analogy or the contrast that
Judge Lombard used in the Rosenberg ease in the Ninth Circuit
was if he stands on a street corner giving out drugs, or
giving out prescriptions, he can’t be prosecuted at all»
But if he writes & piece of paper, which may or may not be
for a legitimate medical purpose, he can be. punished up to
one year*
That doesn't make any sense.

If he’s really soiling

11
drugs, and by sailing prescriptions h©*s selling drugs , he
ought tc b© treated like any other trafficker, like any other
narcotic-» pusher, because h«*s really n© better than that*
And w® think teat Congress intended teat.
Now, vary briefly, the way we read the statute, and
w© think the more • logical way to read the statute is not to
say that when 21 use 841(a)(1) says "except as authorised by
this subchapter" they intend to wholly exempt a whole class
of people»

What they are talking about is conduct that may

be authorised by the subchapter*
Because they say that it shall

be unlawful for any

parson to distribute or dispensa a controlled substance,
except ®s authorized by tea subchapter.
Hew, the kind of conduct involved is then defined
by other provisions of tee aubchapter, beginning with section
822, which requires a registration*

But the registration

doesn't authorize a person so registered to do anything he
wants to with the controlled substance, but, rather, he is
permitted to dispense or distribute only to tea extent
authorized by his1 registration and in conformity with other
provisions of the subchapter..
Now, the registration which Dr* Moore had permitted
him to dispense for detoxification *

Th® evidence at trial

showed that teat's not what he was doing.

Ha was not

dispensing for any legitimate form of medical treatment*

12
But we dori"t rely solely or* that* we rely on the
“in conformity with, other provisions ©f this sub chapter”
language* and the other provisions of the subchapter —•
QUESTIONS

Mr» Friedman* you’ve given up the

regulations?
MR. FRIEDMANs Well, w© have net given up the
regulations.

The way we view the regulations *«

QUESTION8

I didn't see it in your brief.

MR* FRIEDMANi

Well* it was in our reply brief,

because w© don’t 'think that he was prosecuted or convicted
for violating a regulation.

W© think 'that the regulation was

used, really, as a helpful, means for the prosecutor, on short
notice, without any request for a bill of particulars, to
explain to the Court exactly what its theory was, because
306.04(a) of the regulation defines a little more fully what
is meant by "in the course of professional practice", which
is for a legitimate medical purpose.
QUESTIONS

Then you haven’t abandoned that?

MR. FRIEDMAN s

W® have not abandoned our reliance

upon it. as a useful way of describing what he did in violating
the statute.

We do not agree that it was used by the

prosecutor to sat out the criminal offense.
In other words, Mr. Bergen argues that one of the
problems in this case, is that respondent was convicted of
violating a regulation.

We say he wasn't convicted of violating

13
a regulation,, he was convicted of violating a statute which
by its tarns explained what was authorized»

The prosecutor

used tli© regulation before the courts to explain more fully
what tiie statute meant»
To the extent that ho referred to 306,04(c), which
referred to methadone maintenance, that described what Dr*
Moore5 s particular registration permitted him to do and not

to do,

Ha was permitted to detoxify, not to maintain»
But, in point, of fact, fell® theory at trial was that

he did not engage in any bona fide medical practice*

The

expert® said he didn't engage in & practice which was
acceptable either for detoxification or maintenance*

The

lay testimony made clear to anybody listening to it that this
was not legitimate medical practice for any purpose* And
that, we «ay, is what the jury found, and that's a violation
of 841,
QUESTIONe

Did he not rest hie whole defense, or

largely on the idea that that's the way he did it and that
the statute speaks in tarns of his practice, *“•«*
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTIONS

That's exactly right,

-«** and he says that's the way he does

things, even though no on© else doss,
MR, FRIEDMANt

That's exactly right,

And he relied

on two textbooks, one of which he had taken out from the
library the morning of the first day of trial, to support

14
this theory which no on© else viewed &a a legitimate form of
medical practice»
Ha said at trial# and it*s on Appendix page 113#
that it was never his intention to maintain patients»
intent was to detoxify patients and to get them completely off
of all drugs,
done,

I never wanted to maintain patients on metha­

I wanted to make them completely drug free»"
And so# to the extent that wa relied on the regula­

tion# there was no inconsistency# no prejudice to respondent#
aad yet hi® testimony at trial was what ha did was he gave
them ab much as they wanted# to go out# fill themselves up
with methadone# and a new theory of blockading# and teen they
would com© back to him and say# KX am ready now to detoxify051
That's the second stage# r,l can't take any more mate acton®#
I can't take any more heroin,..”
But whan asked about, the second stage# which would
obviously be the crucial stage in that kind of so-called
treatment# psychological counseling# there was non®,
A typical visit lasted from 30 to 60 seconds»

On

on® day he prescribed# h© wrote 271 prescriptions# and he
was asked how he could

do that in a single day# hew he could

counsel# he said# "I either write vary fast# or I talk very
fast# and possibly both K
That's tee kind of practice teat was involved here.
And the statute# we think, by its terms# by its

15
definition of dispensing limited to a practitioner, by its
definition of practitioner, which allows dispensing solely
in the course of professional practice, which means for a
l@gitime.fcf3 medical purpose, Congress intended that this kind
of drag trafficker should be covered by the felony provision
which makes it unlawful to distribute or to sell,
QUESTION* Aren’t you in a little

aren't we

embarking on kind of dubious grounds when we impose criminal,
serious criminal liability based upon professional disagree­
ments among physicians?

This defendant was a physician, was

he siot?

MRc FRIEDMANs
QUESTIONS

Yes, he was,

And isn't it true that historically

most, if not all, of the great breakthroughs and advances in
medical science have been made by people who didn't follow
the conventional way of doing things?
— a nerw ways

They followed their

their way*

And most of the conventional physicians of their
day would have disagreed with them, that this isn't the way
it's always been done*

And if that's — it bothers ma that,

this kind of evidence could send a person to prison for —
how long is this man going «— many, many years.

But, in any

event, that that's the sort of evidence that i;? the basis
for criminal liability.
This man was a physician, he wasn’t a fraud,,

(

16

MR* FRIEDMANS

No question he was a physician.

And no question he was under registration»
QUESTIONs

And he had a new way of doing this , and

he testified what that way was, and it. may have been quite
wrong, and it might ultimately turn out to be very, a very
good way*

But fell® fact that other physicians said that that

wasn’t their way should hardly make a criminal out of this
person»
MR* FRIEDMANts

Well, except that Congress, when it

wrote the Controlled Substances Act, was aware of that
very kind ©£ problem0 There’s some language in the legislative
history that originally appeared in the Prattyman Commission
Report that said that on© of the problems with the Harrison
Act was that we were allowing federal prosecutors to make
judgments as to what is a legitimate modical practice, and
that ought not to ba,
And so, with the Controlled Substances Act, what
Congress ©aid in writing the Controlled Substances Act is
aw® agree”* "But, on the other hand, drug abuse is too
significant a problem to allow this kind of experimentation
by jnut any physician» So what we’re going to do is we*re
going to have a provision in this statute which allows the
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, rather than the
Attorney General, to set cut what kinds of things can be
done «

17
If you want to try a n©w form of treatment; a new
form of treatment that you want to experiment with, well, go
to the Secretary of HEW and he'll give you special registra­
tion to do it under the statute,,

And he's run it, by the

Attorney General, but he'll make tine judgment»
"Now, we don't like the idea,* said Congress,55of
having any official in the federal government defining what
is arid is not permissible, but better it should ba the
Secretary of HEW than ih© Attorney general,B

But it has to

be somebody, it can't ba left to the individual practitioner,
because the potential for abuse is simply too great.
And so, in 21 USC 823(f) there wan provision mad©
for new kinds of research,

if you went to the Secretary of

HEW and said, *1 want to try this kind of method instead."
And in the n<m Act, the Narcotic Addict Treatment
Act of 1974, Congress took it upon itself to put some
specifics into the law by saying that you could never prescribe
for detoxification or maintenance, the implication of the
regulation which was passed after the Narcotic Addict Treatment
Act of 1974, is that it can only be given out in clinics,
it cannot be prescribed to go to pharmacies.
So the Public Health Agency is given the authority
under the Controlled Substances Act to set standards.

If

one complies with those standards, he obviously can't be
prosecuted.

That solves the problem that the Katzenbach

/

18
Commission — I said th® Prettyman Commission, I meant th©
Katzenbach Commission ~~ had noted»
QUESTIONs

But

That doesn*t really solve it,

That

sort of an approach —» under that approach th© world would
still be flat# if Galileo h&d to go and get permission,
MR, FRIEDMANs Wall# it seems to us that th© statute
is talking about a problem of drug abuse and how to control
it.

It recognised that doctors# pharmacies are th© greatest

sources of the illegitimate distribution of narcotics.
That’s amply supported in -she legislative history.
How does it deal with It?
what can and cannot be done?

Does Congress set out

Congress said#1*in th® course

of professional practice, for a legitimate medical purpose»,”
These are terms which this Court had no trouble
with under the Harrison Act,
And on the evidence in this case — and in fact# if
you compare the facts of some of the early Harrison cases,
Jin Fuey May and Webb, as opposed to Linder, which was th.©
later case, and what was involved was four morphine tablets.
We think that under & definition of good-faith
effort to treat, legitimate medical purpose, in the sours© of
professional practice, judges and juries can make those kinds?
of judgments on the evidence before them.

And the facts of

this case are .so blatant, so blatant, that no one could
honestly believe that this man was engaged in legitimate

19
medical practice in th© course of his professional practice»
And the fact that Congress has set up a mechanism
to define what; can and cannot be dons, and -chare are ways to
find out. vrh&fc you can and cannot do, helps to solve the
problem.
Now, to the extent that it doss not ««* it may not
permit every single kind of experimentation in a clinic
program, as opposed to in the laboratory or on an experimental
basis, we think it.3a legitimate for Congress to have made that
judgment because of th® tremendous potential for abuse and
danger, and because of what we see in this case, of th©
addicts, methadone addicts who came into court and testified
as to what Dr» Moore did to them, and how much worse off
they was1® after they went into his program than when they
started in his program.

And that

QUESTION*

Wall, Galileo went to jail, didn’t he?

QUESTION*

That’s right,

MR, FRIEDMANs

I’m afraid —

QUESTION* That, was my point»
MR, FRIEDMAN? :

Well, my history is not as good as

it should be- and
QUESTION *

Well, he did,

QUESTIONs

Well, you know, why shouldn't this guy

go to jail?
QUESTION s

I never thought —- from subsequent

20

history

that it was such a great thing that Galileo had

gone to jail,
However, that's —*
QUESTIONS

Galilee is not her®,

QUESTIONs

Galileo is not in this case; he’s not a

party,
[Laughter, ]
QUESTION*

And Galileo didn’t issue 271 prescriptions

for drugs in on® day, either,
MR, FRIEDMAN?
QUESTION?

No, he didn’t,

2 don’t think he helps us very much, on®

way or the other,
MR, FRIEDMANs Well, in any ©vent, our position in
brief is that Congress intended that people like respondent,
who engage in the kind of conduct that respondent has
engaged in, are covered by 841,

But the technical provisions

of -felt® statute are really not enough, and the anomaly of
relying solely on the technical provisions, as opposed to
the provision for a drug trafficker, makes clear that Congress
really intended that, as does the legislative history.
There’s no indication in the legislative history,
despite an obvious awareness of some of the problems we talked
about, despit® an awareness of what the low was under the
Harrison Act, there’s no indication that Congress intended
to differentiate between practitioners on the one hand and

21
other drug traffickers ©a the other hand.
If they had wanted to change the prior law, we
think they would have been much more explicit in doing so»
Indeed, their awareness of physicians being the
primary source of diversion of drugs indicates just the
contraryn
They intended to get the drug pusher, the drug
trafficker, no matter who he was, and the statutory language*
the scheme in the legislative history all support that»
We think that the Court ©£ Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit ignored the plain language ©f the statute
and the legislative history, in concluding as it did»
And we ask that its judgment foe reversed, and the case
remanded to that Court for the sol© purpose of considering the
problem relating to the sentencing»
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND W» BERGAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR® BERGANs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

tin® Court 8
The Assistant Solicitor General*s essentially
accurate, if somewhat lurid, account of the record, which was
conceded by the respondent in the Court of Appeals, as it is

22
cones dec! in this Court, cannot bo permitted to deter us from
the very narrow scope of the decision of the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit*
I’d like to focus on just what that narrow scope was
for a moment, and the reason given by the Court of Appeals for
its decision*
At the very first page of the prevailing opinion
in the court below, Chief Judge BaseIon, writing for the
majority of that court, after noting that they found section
341 inapplicable to the appellant, Dr* Moor©, and reversed
his conviction, wrote as follows s
*Our conclusion is reached by force of the established
principle that when a choice has to be mad® between two
readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is
appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to
require that Congress should have spoken in language that, is
Clear and definite* ”

And citing Oniversal Cc I • T-. and

decades ©go*
The court then went on to —

No, I ’fit not suggesting -<■*
He may not have known he was violating

QUESTION?

Oh, no, no? Dr, Moore,

MR, BERGAN* First of all, let me preface by saying
teat 1 think no one, either the counsel who represented Dr,
Moor® in the trial court or those of us who represented him
on appeal, ar© going to seek to justify what Dr, Moor© did*

statute,
QUESTIONa
MR, BERGAN*

That's all I'm interested in,
I*ia not suggesting for a moment teat

Dr, Moore was misled by the statute. What 1 am suggesting,
Mr, Chief Justice, is that the statute, particularly section
841 and the other provisions of that subchapter, does not

24
proscribe the conduct of which Dr,, Moore was adjudged guilty,
as criminal under section 841*
How, it may proscribe it under section 842 or
possibly tinder section 843,

But it does not proscribe it

under section 841,
And that is the narrow holding of the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia CircuitB

MR, BERGAN*

I believe the Seventh Circuit has

recently so held, and I®ia unclear about, th© Sixth, but I
believe that's the other one, Mr, Justice Stewart,
QUESTIONt

So that leaves the District of

Columbia Circuit standing alone on this?
MR, 3ERGAN: The District of Columbia Circuit stands
alone with a dissenting opinion from Judge Ely in tha Ninth
Circuit recently in the Rosenberg case, which was decided,
oh, probably about the time that this Court granted certiorari
in this case,
QUESTION* But I gather, the question as you sse it

25
is the one you just — before I asked my question

whether

or not the proscription limits a registered physician to
whatever may be the penalties for violation of his registra~
tion?
HR, BERGANs

That* e right, Mr» Justice Brennan, 1

think that®a the precise issue,

What does section 841 *»«-

section 841(a) of the statute mean when it says “except as
provided by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any
person” and then we skip down to subsection

(1) , "to distribute

a controlled substance” in a situation in which w© have a
licensed physician in the District of Columbia, who is
registered by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
to prescribe controlled substances# in this instance Schedula
II narcotic, dolophine or methadone, as it's commonly called,
Judge Bazelon wrote in the court below, and we
believe it to be th@< correct analysis of what the legislative
history in this casa looks toward, or leads to, that
Congress in passing the Controlled Substances Act, aware of
the Frettyman Commission and the Katsenbach Commission Reports,
aware of the difficulties suggested by some of the oases which
this Court, had in the 1920 *s and the 1930* a under the
Harrison Act, the problems of physicians in allowing a lay
prosecutor and a jury of laymen to determine» what was, in
affect, criminal or civil or proper medical practice, divided
the drug universe — if on® may use that expression — into

26

two sub-universes, if you wishs

those registered to deal in

drugs and those not so registerede
And, indeed, the House Committees Report precisely
says that, and this is quoted at an early page of our brief
in this Court, it's quoted at page 9s
53The. bill® «- and that describee the bill which
became the Controlled Substances Act —- “The bill provides
for control by the Justice Department of problems related to
drug abuse through registration of manufacturers, wholesalers,
retailers, and all others in the legitimate distribution
chain” «« that's doctors, pharmacists, those authorized to
deal in narcotica «-*
QUESTIONS

Mr® Bergan, before you get to the legis­

lative history, how do you, in the statute itself, discern
this'division into two universes, as you speak of them?

MRa BERGANs

Primarily, Mr® Justie® Rehnquist, in

the language of Section B41 *•«
QUESTION*
MR* BERGAN 8

That's 401 in U* S. Code?
Mr® Justice, I*m sorry, I. don’t know»

My friend says the answer to that is yes, but I'm using the
references in tha ~~ that were used in the opinion of the
court below, end tha ones that we have used in the brief®
The language of section 841, the "except as
authorised*3 language, suggests, it seems to us, that when you
read that subchapter, one has to read "except as authorised

27

by this subchapter* —»
QUESTION:

"By this title r\

MR0 BERGANt

Right*

"By this titles” -» in the

original it was subchapter, but as it was codified it becomes
that title*
You find, In that title, in section 822(b), a provision
for registration-,

Dr* Moor® was of course oonoededly

registered with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
as the agency was called at that time, at all times through
the course of the conduct for which he was prosecuted,
convicted, and sentenced*
Section 822(b) provides that “Persons registered by
the Attorney General 0»« to dispense controlled substances". •»«
and I*ia eliding & few words in this quote —- "are authorized
to dispense such substances to the extent so authorised", I
believe that’s the precise language of section 822(b)*
Now, he was authorised*
QUESTION* But doesn’t 401(a) "except as authorized
by this title, it.shall be unlawful for any person", and then
it proscribes a series cf acts, doesn’t that suggest that the
exception is in terns of acts or conduct rather than in
terms of persons?
MR * BERGAN s

No, I think not.,, Mr* Justice R@hnqu.ist*

X think not for the reason that those acts *»« and I take it
you’re referring to 'the provisions of subdivision. (1) end

28

subdivision (2), manufacture, distribute* dispense?
QUESTION s

Right®

MR* BERGAH a

Right.

Th± particular language.

Those are the acts which are covered by the classes

of parsons who are permitted to registar to do those acts
under the preceding sections of tk® statute.

For example*

section 822 picks up almost the same language* section 822(a)
refers to annual registrations

wEvery person who manufactures,

distributes, or dispenses any controlled substance or who
proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution, or dis­
pensing of any controlled substance, shall annually obtain a
registration issued by the Attorney General in accordance
with the rules and regulations promulgated by him.?
QUESTIONs Well, look at subsection (2) of 841,
where it’s made unlawful to " create, distribute, or dispense,
or possess with intent to distributa or dispense, a
counterfeit substance.*
Now, it*s your position that doctors are authorized
to distributa counterfeit substances?
MR. BERGANs

No, I — there's no provision that 1

know of in the statute that would authorize- the registration
of physicians, or anyone else, pharmacists or manufacturers
or whatever, to create, distribute or dispense counterfeit
substances QUESTION: But they couldn’t be prosecuted — a

29

doctor couldn11 b® prosecuted under 841 (2) under your theory,
even though he dispenses a counterfeit substance?
MR„ BERGANs

No, X suggest that, Mr. Justice

Rehnguist, perhaps I1ve not mad® my theory clear»
Let m© put it this way»

A doctor could not, under

Mr, Bergan, the statute would b© more

that* Mr» Justice Blackmun, there would b© no ambiguity, and
the answer to your suggestion is yes# it would be more helpful
to me if 1 said 'that»

X wish that it said that»

It doesn't,

unfortunately»
But X believe that the manner in which the statute
is written creates an ambiguity which requires a kind of
liberalised —- if that’s the correct word — construction
placed on it by Judge Baa»Ion for the reason teat the earlier
cases from this Court so hold- that before ones can say that
the Congress intended the more saver® of two or more possible
alternatives to result, they should have spoken so — spoken
to that with more clarity than they did in this case»
QUESTIONS Suppos© Dr» Moors, in his office, dispensed

QUESTION}

Mr® Bergen, it seams to me that, the «*«

you rest on the provisions of 841, which say "except as
authorized*; and then 822(b) is headed "Authorised Activities*,
so you look for this -- under your theory, even under your
theory yota*d look to what the scop© of the authorized activity
was,

And 822(b) says 51 to the extent authorized by their

ragis tration**
MR* BERGANi
QUESTION#

That's correct,
Now, let’s

it. seems to me we must than

ask what did the registration authorize them to do?

Right

i

)

in the plain words of 822(b),
You wouldn’t suggest that their registration, just
on its face, authorized them to sell methadone without a
prescription, for example?
MR, BERGANi

Obviously it’s not a willy-nilly

author! s at.ton „
QUESTIONt Well, then, it seems to me the "except aa
authorized* language of 841 doesn't help you at all, if you

33
d© a mem thing in selling methadone that isn't authorised by

MR» BERGAN?

But my registration, or Dr, Moore's

Now, that was not authorized by his

MR, BERGAN? Assuming his registration was limited
to "by prescription", that would not be authorized»

He would

be outside the authorized chain,
QUESTION s Well, then, he could bis prosecuted under
841, even under your theory?
MR,-. BERGAN? Because he was not authorised to do
what he then did»
QUESTION? All right.

Then that's the answer to

Mr*. Justice White is that he just wasn't authorized to do that»
MR, BERGAH?

Well, if that's the situation, yes»

reached under 841 if he sold without a prescription?
MR» BERGANi

Yes, on the assumption that his ~~

let's take an easy example, if he went out to the playground
at Central High School and sold methadone, then the answer to

your question would be y®se

The* extent of his registration

was to proscribe and dispans® controlled substances in that
way, and ha was then acting outside the scop® of his
registration, end he doesn*t fall within the "except as
otherwise

authorized** language of section 841.
QUESTION?

Mr* Berg an, on tills question of what a

doctor can do, 1 suppose, hypothetically, you’d agree that
— or perhaps you wouldn’t

that the old practice of bleeding

patients, which was don© 150 to 200 years ago, is -« let’s
assume it9a no longer accepted medical practice, I suppose
that’s so.
MR.» BERGAN:

i think we can assume -that together,

I wouldn’t take that type of case.
QUESTION:

I suppose because X don’t know, but

suppose a doctor just simply took hiss, some kind ©£ a knife
and cut on© of his patients* arteries, and then just wont
i

out to play golf arid let th© patient die on th© place where
he’d left him, do you suppose that

sob®

suggestion that

this was his medical practice, his way of treating patients,
would help him on a manslaughter case?
MR. BERGANj

X think not at all.

2 think the case

you have put, Mr. Chief Justice, would b© a classic manslaughter
situation.
QUESTION:

How, undoubtedly, in such a case, the

prosecution would bring in physicians who would testify that

36

that was not accepted practice, presumably

or let's assume,

in defense he*d bring in some kind of textbook

material or

soma expert evidence that this was a new idea, and that it
might b© coming back again, the bleeding processe

And then

the jury would decide that question»
How does that differ, in terms of what was submitted
to the jury here?
MR» 3ERGAN t

1 think it

differs markedly, Mr»

Chief Justice*
First of all, let me say to you that, as we have
developed in the brief, and as was developed at soma minor
extent by the opinion in the court below, not to any great
extant *■»- because it wasn't necessary to reach that point —
this kind of a situation, the kind of a situation with which
wa'r® dealing her®, section 841 of the Controlled Substances
Act ought not to depend upon conflicting medical opinions
as 'to what is or what is not valid,,
A fallow ought not to be -*» and I suggest that the
statute does not permit a fellow to be »« prosecuted,
convicted,, sentenced to a long period of incarcerationp ~~
And the answer to your question, Mr» Justice Stewart, is that
it was 45 years

-« because of conduct which is subject to

conflicting views among physicians»
Mow, we're dealing in an area, and the Congress
has been wrestling with this area for several decades, and

37
that8s the area of nareotics0

The Schedule 1 narcotic, for

example, no one would dispute? that*e heroin and others which
have no real medical value*

And the Congress has, in this

st&tut© and in others, in effect saids

Thou shalfc not use it®

The Schedula II, Schedula III and Schedule IV °-»*
and they go down in order of difficulty to handle

- are

narcotics as to which all persona would perhaps say, as to
some, that there is seme legitimate medical value? perhaps
fewer persons would say, as to some of them, that there is
greater or less legitimate medical value®
That* a why 1 suggest *—* and this is laid out at
some length in the Pro ttyman Report,? it has troubled this
Court from time to time over the last 35 or 40 years, beginning
Moy

with a case which I regret that 1 can never pronounce, Jin

Iso»

Fuey Moy, I believe is the case, and leading up to Linder
perhaps even more recently*

It's laid out in the Prettymar;

Report and the Katsanbach Report, and that's why I suggest
that in this particular statute, as the Congress itself
said, as the House Report itself says, the world of the drug
universe is divided into those registered to do certain
things, and those who are not registered to do certain things®
We deal more harshly with the ones who are not
registered to do these things, because they are outside the
chain where wo can keep an eye on them and see what they do®
And revoke their registration, or refuse to re*-*register them*

38
Pardon me# sir?
QUESTION*

Even though section 841 refers to "any

parson53?
MR» BERGAN*

Y^So

Yes»

QUESTION * So that# in effect# you are saying *— and
I guess I am trying to ba facetious,, but a physician is not
"a person" 'within the meaning of that section®
MR» 8ERG.ANs

No»

Xsra not saying that»

What I air. saying is that when that section goes on
to say# Mr* Justice Blackxaun# "except as authorised by this
3ubchapter3

indicated» «“
QUESTION* Well# Mr* Bergen# even though everything
you have said certainly is — was the subject of congressional
concern, so also# was there not# a concern 'chat among the
worst abusers in the drug traffic field were physicians»
MR® BERGAN;

Thera was -that concern»

It was

expressed by the Congress in the passage of this very Act=
And having so been expressed# the Congress then went on# I
suggest# Hr» Justice Brennan# to divide the world ©f those
who deal with drugs into those who do so under the watchful
eye of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs — or now

QUESTION* Do you think there*a any significance,
Mr* Bergen, in the fact that 841 is entitled "Prohibited Acts"?
MR* BERGAN s
the title»

No, I don't find any significance in

It's bean a long time, Mr» Chief Justice, since

I dealt with codified statutes, but. those titles are
normally put in by the codifier, and it’s clear that it dees
in fact deal with -« let me com© directly to the question which
r

you*re asking, it does deal with prohibited acts»
It does deal with prohibited acts, and if this man
was operating beyond his registration, as, for example, going
across to the front steps of the Capitol and handing out
heroin, the fact that he was registered with the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to do something els®, the fact
that he was a physician would not immunize him from prosecution,
In this case, however, because he was registered to
do what he did, the remedy was twofold, together or one at a
time«
D©registration or refusal to register on an annual
basis, when he cam® for re~registration, and/or prosecution
under 842 or 843 of the statute, for the various things which
registrants are precluded from doing»

40
QUESTIONS Wellf 1st me ask you, do you think that he
was -- do you think 842 or 843 would proscribe the conduct
for which he was prosecuted in this case?
MR® BERGANj

Yes, I think it could, Mr. Justice

Whit®.
QUESTION*

You think the government is wrong in

saying that unless h©ss liable under 841, he isn't liable
at all for the specific conduct that

» for which he was

convicted in this case?
MR. BERGAN*

Oh, I*m not terribly sure that the

government is taking that position.

It may be that «« I'm

just not sure that that is the position they're taking.
For example, 'though, section 842 makes it criminal
to fail to keep records, end it defines the types of records
which were required to be kept.

susceptible of th©

of a finding, if a section 842 charge

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L» FRIEDMAN , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN*

Just two quick comiants,

Mr* Bergen’s main point, I think, was that
administrative controls ought to be used instead of criminal

all doctors must be registered if they are licensed to
practice medicine.

So ifc*s not that it’s a discretionary

thing to deny them their registration.
And that there are only three reasons for revoking
registrations prior to th® Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of

QUESTION * Well, you’re not -« but, on your theory
of -the relationship between 341 and 822, it seems to me that
you could just as well argue that any violation of the

QUESTION?

No*

My question is whether for some

violations registrants may nevertheless not be prosecuted
under 841.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's a technical and formal

violation of their registration, they are liable under 842
and 043.
QUESTION*

What’s a technical and formal violation?

MR* FRIEDMAN* Well* Congress set it out. in the
legislative history.

There are certain ‘things that are

Let me give therexaot language*

Your colleague suggested that if he

doesn’t dispense with a prescription, he can be reached under
841,
MR, FRIEDMAN*

842(a)(1) says that you are subject

to a one-year penalty if you distribute or dispense in viola­

MR,

FRIEDMANs :

No,

No,

Because then it* & not

practice,
QUESTION® That adds another criteria,
MR, FRIEDMANS

Well, it’s in the statute.

But that6 a in the statute»
What, we're saying is that the statute has two
requirements, that what is authorized under 841 is what is
authorised to the extent authorized by your registration»
And some registrations permit you to detoxify# some
registrations permit you to do other things# some registra­
tions say you can us® methadone but you can't us® other forms

of drugs»
And# secondly# you may only «- the only authorized
activities are those which are in conformity with other
provisions of the subchapter.
Now# the other provisions of the subchapter use
the language, "In the course of professional practice" and
"for a legitimate medical purpose"»

professional practice" and "not for a legitimate medical

MR» FRIEDMANS

I think that*8 right»

QUESTIONs Well; civil liability is one thing,, and
45 years in the penitentiary is something a little different.
Civil liability for negligence or malpractice «—
MR. FRIEDMANs

Yes, but we’re not talking about,

negligence or malpractice.
QUESTION'S well, that’s what Justice White, I think,
was talking about.
QUESTIONi

Maybe 1 misunderstood him.
Well, that’s the standard you’re

suggesting, though, in these other provisions, if for no
legitimate medical purpose»
MR. FRIEDMANs

That's right.

That’s what the

regulations say, that’s what the statute says.,

And that’s

what the decisions of this Court say.
But we've been able to distinguish what i.s legitimate
and what is not. legitimate and what is within the scope of

50
legitimacy, and what is so far beyond the pal©, that under
no interpretation could it be considered legitimate medical
practice or in the course of professional practice,
