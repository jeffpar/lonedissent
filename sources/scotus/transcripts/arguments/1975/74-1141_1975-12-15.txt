QUESTION:

Thank you.

Yes.

MR. FREY:

That Ethridge case is miscited.

It

did not involve equal concurrent sentences and that citation
should be deleted and I suppose the e.g. signal should
also be deleted because I can't replace it with ary other
cases.

It is not pertinent to the main body of my argument

but I would like to —
QUESTION:

[Inaudible.]

MR. FREY:

I believe it does.

Now, we have presented basically three arguments
to the Court in our brief.

First, that the Milanovich

decision is distinguishable on these facts.
Second, that the either/or instruction and the new
trial remedy dictate^! by Milanovich were incorrect and that
the case should be overruled and,
Thirdly, failing those n.rgupnnhs that any retrail
that might take place in this case should be limited to
a selection by the jury between the possession and the theft

7
offense anci should not entail a retrial of quilt or innocence.
We have not argued, although it was argued in
the Court of Appeals and this is a point that nay perhaps
be kept in mind, the plain error issue.

Milanovich did not

deal with the question of whether it was plain error
because there was an objection in Milanovich.
Here there was no objection and presumably if the
either/or instruction was correct, then we hope the Court
will hold that no such instruction ought to be given but
if it should be given, had defense counsel pointed out to
the Court, the error could have been rectified at the time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, as I understand it, you do

agree, do you not, that a person cannot be convicted of
both hank robbery and of receiving or possessing the pro­
ceeds of the robbery of the same robbery?
MR. FREY:

No, I don't think that's --..I don't

think that is correct.

What we do agree with, we don't

dispute Heflin and what we do agree with is there can be
no accumulation or pyramiding of punishments.
We

when it comes to the question of whether

they can be convicted, I think that is not, in a sense an
important question, so long as they are not cumulatively
punished.
We would have no objection to a rule which
required the vacation of a possession conviction.

8
QUESTION:

Would you have had an objection to an

instruction in this case that had said, if you find that
these people were the robbers, beyond a reasonable doubt,
then you should convict then of bank robbery, but if they
were the robbers, then they were not guilty of receiving
stolen goods.
MR. FREY:

I — on the facts of this particular

cane we would have had no objection because on the facts
of this —
QUESTION:

All the evidence was, in this case,

that they were the robbers.
MR. FREY:

On the facts of this particular case,

I think there was simply no independent basis for convicting

them of possession and it was completely irrational.
QUESTION:

There was none.

MR. FREY:

Right.

QUESTION:

Well, in the Milanovich case there was

a distinction in the facts, wasn't there?
MR. FREY:

Yes.

V7e distinguish Milanovich from

this case because in Milanovich there was separate evidence
of a separate receipt transaction.

However —

QUESTION:

Seventeen days apart.

MR. FREY:

Seventeen days apart.

QUESTION:

Evidence of each one of them.

MR. FREY:

But the Courts of Appeals, in applying

9

Milanovich, have rather consistently taken, extracted from
Milanovich the principle that the two offenses being
inconsistent in law, although of course they are not
inconsistent in fact, this either/or instruction must be
given to the jury.
Normally I believe it is important to submit both
counts to the jury.

Now, on the facts of this case where

there was absolutely no independent evidence of possession,
I think it would have been

quite proper for the District

Court simply not to instruct the jury on possession.
Normally — and I might mention that the Court
had before it two petitions which, I guess, it is holding
for the time being, in cases that raise related facets of
this problem.
One is a case called United States against- Sellers
out of the Fourth Circuit.
Now, Sellers was halfway between the facts of the
present case and the facts of Milanovich
little closer to Milanovich, I

would say.

in that -- or a
In Sellers he

was found with the loot sometime later so that there was
independent evidence of possession.
It would have been logically possible for the
jury to convict of possession only and not. of robbery.
That case might more squarely present the problem
about which we are concerned.

1.0

There also is a case called Phillips, also out of
the Fourth Circuit in which we have petitioned and there
three of the judges in the Fourth Circuit held that it was
a defense to a possession charge to prove that you were the
robber.

That also is, to

us a wooden and improper applica­

tion of the principles that underlie Heflin.
Now, I mention those caser, just to keep in mind
that there is a broad spectrum of factual variance that
can arise.
New, certainly, in this case we have argued that
these on the facts where all the evidence points to
robbery, where there is no independent evidence of
possession, at least in that case there is no basis for
ordering a new trial and at most it would simply be logical
to vacate the possession conviction and the concurrent
sentence on that point.
No.v’, I will say that Respondents have argued that
this case is not distinguishable from Mllanovich and their
argument is cased on the fact that one of the Respondents,
the evidence suggested it was Respondent Gaddis, was the
driver of the getaway car and not an actual entrant into the
banlc during the robbery.
The argument then is that he is similarly situated
to Mrs. Milanovich because he was not a principal.
he did not take the money out cf the bank drawers.

That is,

11

That argument would have a little more merit
were it not for the fact that

he was a principal in one

of the assaults involved in this case.

That is, it was he

who shot Officer Cody, according to the evidence and so
that, I thirk, creates some difficulty in analogizing his
situation with that of Mrs. Milanovich.
QUESTION:

Well, there was no question in the

Milanovich case that had the jury believed that Mrs. Milano­
vich and her husband had had indeed been the drivers of
the getaway car, that they would have been, themselves,
guilty of bank robbery.

Dut that was up to the jury and

there was wholly different and independent evidence
indicating that some 17 days later she had dug up some -made a hole in the ground and dug up the proceeds of a bank
robbery and those were two separate —
MP. FPFY:

It was a theft, not a robbery.

Yes, it

QUESTION:

I'm snjiry, theft from a commissary

down in Norfolk.
MR. FREY:

Yes.

Yes.

Well, it was — it's true

that the evidence was far more separated than here but
logically one could perhaps suggest that after all, the
Government's witness was corobber Davis and his testimony
was that Gaddis had waited outside in tne getaway car and
that after they had made their getaway, they had divided
the loot.

12
Logically/ I suppose one could argue, although I
don't think it is an empirical possibility on this record,
that the jury could have disbelieved that Gaddis' portion
of his testimony -- the portion that Gaddis was involved in
the robbery — but believe the portion that he divided the
proceeds.
You shake your head, Justice Stewart, end I
think it is obviously unlikely.
QUESTION:

Well, juries have done stranger things

than that at times.
MR. FREY:

Well, they have done strange things.

I do — we do submit that the cases are dis­
tinguishable but I also submit at the: heart of this whole
problem is the either/or instruction that this Court
indicated in the Milancvich case was required and I believe,
and it is our submission to the Court that that instruction
has been the source of considerable problems in the
administration of the Bank Robbery Act and that it is not
justified upon close analysis and that this Court ought now
to indicate that the either/or instruction is improper
and ought not to be given in the future.
Now, the first defect —
QUESTION:

Do you mean by that that the problem

of double punishment could be taken care of by the
sentencing or —

13

MR. PREY:

By the sentencing court.

QUESTION:

Or, the judge did, indeed, give

cumulative sentences for both offensas.

That could be

readily corrected on a remand review.
MR. FREY:
That would be

Or even on subsequent attack later on.

That

is exactly our position and, indeed —
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Frey, if all the evidence in

the case for the prosecution is that the Defendant — let's
simplify this and just say there is one — entered a bank,
armed, held up the teller, left with the money.

Is there

any ground at all upon which the trial judge should instruct
the jury with respect to tha offense of possession or
receipt of the proceeds of a bank robbery?
MR. FREY:

Well, I agree, Justice Stewart that —

QUESTION:

No, just answer the question.

Given

my case, where all the evidence for the prosecution indicates
that the Defendant was a bank robber., period.
MR. FREY:

I think it would be proper not to

submit the possession.
QUESTION:

It would be improper to submit it,

wouldn't it?
MR. FREY:

Well --

QUESTION:

HR. FREY:

I am reluctant to say that because if

pyramid punishment.

QUESTION:

Any more than in a bank robber case it

would have been — it might be error for a trial judge to
instruct the jury on a dire act offense.

There ie just no

evidence of it.
MR. FREY:

Well, but that requires us to conclude

before the jury has decided the case what the evidence shows.
Now, I think it is true that there is no evidence
and it ought not to be 3u.bird.tted but there are lesser
included offense cases where there is virtually no evidence
in courts of appeals that nevertheless -QUESTION:

Well, Heflin said that it was not a

lesser inc.luded offense, did it not?

Heflin.

MR. FREY:

I understand.

I cite that by analogy.

QUESTION:

But that is not an analogy, given

This is not a lesser included offense.
MR. FREY:

Well, I fail —

QUESTION:

Is it?

MR. FREY:

— to see the

from the standpoint of

safety, there is no conceivable prejudice to the defendant
from submitting the possession count and it eliminates the

15

-

possibility that an appellate court might later determine
that perhaps the jury could somehow have convicted of
possession and acquitted under the either/or instruction,
acquitted of robbery.
I mean, that would be out of a. great abundance cf
caution that one would submit and if I were the district
judge in this case I think I would not have submitted it
because I think it is clear on this evidence that it would
have been unnecessary.
QUESTION:

Nell, why do you say that there is

no evidence of possession?
MR. FREY:

V7ell, there is evidence.

QUESTION:

Certainly he had it and he possessed it.

But you certainly can argue very sensibly that that wasn’t
what, Congress didn't intend to make a separate crime cut of
possessing what you stole.
MR. FREY:

Well, that is what

QUESTION:

Yes.

Heflin suggests —

MR. FREY: — that Congress [intended] and
Milsnov.ich, where the possession is distinct in time and
proved by distinct evidence suggests that even there
Congress did not intend to make it a separate offense.
Of course, as a matter of fact, the parson is
guilty of possession and were he indicted only for possession
and not for robbery there would be no obstacle to

16
convicting hin of possession.
QUESTION:

Doesn’t

the submission of both these

questions to the jury invite the bizarre result — I say
’’bizarre" it would have been bizarre on this evidence — to
find him not guilty of bank robbery but guilty of possession.
MR. FREY:

Well, it would be bizarre and —

QUESTION:

But those things have happened, in a

compromise verdict.
MR. FREY;

Well, it could happen if there were

an either/or instruction.

Then it would be considerable

risk that something like that would happen and I would like
to mention a case to show that rr.y concern with the either/or
instruction is not a simply wild conjecture.
An individual attempted to buy a car and he used
one hundred $5 bills to make his down payment on the car and
those bills were checked and they turned out to contain the
bait money from a recent bank robbery.
He was arrested and he was indicted for bank
robbery.
The prosecution theory being that his possession
of these bills, his recent possession of these bills
permitted the jury to infer that he was involved in the
robbery itself.
The evidence showed that he was not one of the
robbers at the bank but it also showed that he had been in

17
the vicinity of the bank shortly before the robbery.
The jury accepted the prosecution's theory and
convicted the defendant of robbery.

The case was appealed.

Now, had there been an either/or instruction — and,
fortunately, there was no possession charge in this case,
the jury would presumably have had to acquit him of the
possession charge of which he was clearly guilty pursuant
to the Mllanovich either/or instruction.
The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals.

X

think Justice Blackmun may remember this case because he
sat on the panel in the Eighth Circuit at the time and the
Court of Appeals said, The evidence is not sufficient to
establish robbery.
It merely shows possession.

The inference from

possession to robbery is not strong enough where there is
no evidence bes3.des the guilty possession and therefore, it
reversed the conviction for robbery and it ordered the
entry of a judgment of acquittal on the robbery charge.
Now, this case is United States against Jones,
418 F Second 818, which is cited in our brief.

Had Jones

been charged with possession as well as with robbery,
had the jury been given the either/or instruction, they very
likely would have convicted him of robbery, acquitted him
of the possession charge and on appeal the Court of /appeals
would have said, well, this dogSn*^- make out robbery and

18

he would have gone scot free.
Now., that is a serious problem.
QUESTION:
and so on.

Well, that is — you 3ay undoubtedly

That is a hypothetical case.

In the actual

Jones case, he could have been indicted for possession and
there would have been no double jeopardy question whatsoever
because ha had not been charged with that the first time
around, as you give it to us.
MR. FREY:

But this requires a degree of

prescience and prediction by the prosecutor in making an
indictment,by the judge in submitting the case to the jury
and the question is, why ought not the jury be allowed to
consider tha facts.
QUESTION:

That is, did these defendants, in fact

MR. FEISY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

What would happen in this case if he

had been found not guilty of possession?
MR. FREY:

Nothing.

In this very case.

There would have been

absolutely no difference had he been found not guilty
of possession.
QUESTION:

It would have been an awfully silly

QUESTION:

I don't see why we have to make rules

to let the prosecutor try any way he wants to try.

I think

he should follow the rules.
MR. FREY:

Well —

QUESTION:

If he decides to try a nan on possession

he is stuck with it.

If he decides to try him on robbery,

he is stuck with it.
MR. FREY:

Well, Mr. Justice —

QUESTION:

He shouldn't have it both ways.

MF. FREY:

Well, but that --

QUESTION:

Do

MR. FREY:

Not really, Mr. Justice Marshall,

you agree with that?

because even in Milanovich, there was no question that the
prosecutor was entitled to indict on both charges and
everybody agreed that he was not required to elect between

r

20

the charges.

The issue was, when the case went to the jury,

was the jury to be forced to select between the two charges?
And that is what we are saying was the mistaken holding cf
Milanovich.
QUESTION:

But it was all brought about by the

prosecution putting all four of these together.

When he

gets to the jury, doesn't he have a duty of deciding which
one should go to the jury?
MR. FREY:
Mr. Justice Marshall.

I don't believe that is the law,
lie is not required —

QUESTION:

But don't you think he ought to?

MR. FREY:

No, I don't —

QUESTION:

MR. FREY:

QUESTIONS

to read associate defense counsel.

I mean, thcit — nobody —

so should the judge — but nobody pointed out — I mean,
apparently, there was not an awareness of Milanovich.
QUESTION:

Well, there is now.

It h&s been

pointed out now by the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, Milanovich was a totally different

case from this on its facts — isn't it?

21

MR. FREY:

That is our contention.

QUESTION:

Well, it is borne out by the opinion.

The opinion indicates that one crime was committed and this
woman — a case against her for the bank robbery was dubious
at best and pro!ably could not be made out, but the case
against her for the possession is perfectly clear, two or
three weeks later.
MR. FREY:

Well, I think both cases were quite

clear in Milanovich and it is true that the cases are
distinguishable but honestly, I don’t think I can say to you
that Milanovich itself

depended upon that distinction.

In fact, Justice Frankfurter's dissent was bused
largely on the proposition in Milanovich that these were
two distinct offenses in fact and therefore the Milanovich
rule ought not to be held proper.

That is. Justice Frank­

furter thought that she should be coavictable of both
offenses because of the degree of separation between the two.
QUESTION:

Well, assuming that the prosecutor on

your view., should not be required to make an election before
he starts — that is —
MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

— he is entitled to wait until his

evidence is in to see what his case is -- where the strength
and weakness of his case is —

doesn’t the either/or

instruction present a parallel to the idea of dismissing

22

one charge at that time?
MR. FREY:

Well, we would submit that either the

dismissal of one charge at that time or the either/or
instruction would be erroneous.
QUESTION:

There is no harm —

You are talking about what he is

required to do.
MR, FREY:

He is not required to elect — both

counts can go to the jury.

That much is clear.

That is,

it i3 established that both counts can go to the jury in
the normal case.
Now, I agree with Justice Stewart that in this
case, there was really no occasion to submit the possession
count because of the nature of the evidence

and therefore

however, in having done so — certainly no

basis for awarding a new trial.

MR. FREY:

They said "Guilty on each count."

Eight counts, guilty as to count one, guilty as to count two,

That is the form of the

verdict and it is in the appendix.
They didn't just say "guilty."

It is just a question of whether the

MR. FREY:
What the

Well, this is a very technical area.

Court of /appeals held is, well, they may have

robbed the bank and they may have possessed the proceeds
but they couldn't be convicted of booh and therefore, although
nobody doubts that they robbed the bank and possessed the
proceeds, we are going to give them a new trial and the
reason we are going to give them a new trial is because
the judge didn't give an either/or instruction which, if I
may give an analogy, it is a little bit like saying to the
jury, "You are asked to find on count one whether one foot
equals 12 inches and on count two, whether three feet equals
a yard, but you may not find both."
QUESTION:

Now, in Milanovich f as you have pointed

out, Justice Frankfurter dissented and in his dissent, he

said this.

"It is Hornbook lav; that a thief cannot be

charged with commitinq two offenses, that is, stealing and
receivincr the goods he has stolen."
This is not a natter of inconsistency, of the
general rule of inconsistent offenses.

This is a specific

rule as to robbery and receiving stolen property.

QUESTION:

Not in this case you don't.

MR. FREY:

It is true that this case falls within

a subclass of the cases in which we have had these issues
arise where I agree, it would have been better to indict
these people in one count under (d) for aggravated bank
robbery and treat the (a) and (b) as lesser offenses.
But it is clearly harmless error in the

27

circumstances.

It hardly warrants a new trial, even if

you v/ere to hold the prosecutor was in error in framing
his indictment in that fashion and that the court was in
error in submitting it to the jury.
The problem will — that holding, I think, would
be correct.

The problem, I assume, would be back before

this Court shortly because I do submit, with all respect,
for the reasons I have indicated, that it is a continuing
problem in the administration of the federal theft statutes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wilcox.

for reexamination of the sentence to see that double

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOMMY DAY WILCOX, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. WILCOX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before I begin, I wotild also like to make a
notation and correction, if you will, in the Respondents'
brief on the merits.
It is on paqe 9 and it comes from a quote by
Judge Duniway in the Ninth Circuit in the case of United
States y. Tyler;about one-third way down the page the quote
begins and it begins by leaving off the word "A".
typographical error, I assume.

It is a

But that particular quote

should read, "A case does not decide only the exact factual
question that it presents —" and then it continues on as it
is there.
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

"A case."
"A case."
Where is that?
Page 9 on the merits.

Before beginning my argument, let me say that my
name is Tommy Day Wilcox and I am counsel for the Respondents
Gaddis and 3irt.

In the tir

29
In the trini of this particular case I was trial
counsel for Billy Sunday Birt.

Mr. Tommy Mann of Macon,

Georgia, was the attorney for Mr. Bobby Gene Gaddis.
After conviction, Mr. Mann and I, as cocounsel,
represented these two Respondents on appeal.

I now

represent the two of them together, of course.
QUESTION:

Why didn't you object to the failure

to give the irstruction that you now say should have been
given?
MR. WILCOX:
that question.

The — there are two responses co

Certainly I accept responsibility for these

Respondents for not requesting that charge.

Our theory of

that, particular case, of course, after interviewing these
two defendant? , was one, that they were not involved at all,
either as possessing or robbery so from that standpoint,
that was one reason we did not request it.
Quite frankly, your Honor, I was not aware of this
line of cases and therefore, I did not request this
particular instruction.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the whole

point of

objections in the trial court, is sc that a district judge
who may be on the point of erring can have his attention
called and if you fail to object, you are presumably barred
from raising that point.
MR. WILCOX:

You are, your Honor, unless it is

30

plain error.
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

And why was this plain error?
The reason this was plain error is

that for one thing, whether or not an objection is made,
as plain error or not, more times than not, goes to the
facts in the case so the courts that have considered that
have said that, anyway, whether or not the evidence was
overwhelming cr not but to this particular point I would
cite the Court's attention to at least three appellate
courts that have — were presented with this particular
question and decided that it was plain error in the

case

not to give tl e particular instruction that should have
been requested.
QUESTION:

Well, why did they decide it was

plain error?
MR. WILCOX:

The cases are United Statas v. Roach

and O'Neal versus the United States and those cases went off
on the fact that — and also, in Baber versus the United
States, almost the same thought that I am giving here, your
Honor, one, tha evidence was not overwhelming in these
particular casas and the court concluded that it was plain
error and it went to, certainly, the merits of the
Defendants' claim.
QUESTION:

Well, that is true of almost any jury

exception, it seems to me.

If you say this is plain error

31

you are going to end up sayinq that counsel never has to
object because you can always call it plain error.

The

district judge could have shaped his instructions to confori
to your objection had you called his attention to the
Milanovich case, I would think.
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTIOM:

You ~
You say frankly that you didn't know

of it and he didn't know of it but I would think it is
counsel's job to call his attention to that.
MR. WILCOX:

Certainly we bear some of the

responsibility but in this particular case and in this
particular situation the question here is, how to avoid,
I think, your Honor, the error that was committed by the
lower court.
First of all, the prosecution has all of the facts
of the case.

They certainly did in this case in that

Mr. Davis was arrested and after getting his statement
this particular indictment ensued.
The prosecution then, as Mr. Justice — there is
a dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Clarke, in the Milanovich
decision, said it would better be to have the prosecution
elect whether or not, at the onset, they were qoing to indict
for possession and for robbery and second, of course, the
prosecution could have dismissed this particular charge
before it went to the jury and the judge, of course, has

32
some duty to properly instruct the jury but no, your Honor,
I again would say that certainly it was my responsibility
and I did not request that particular charge in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, if, in evaluating a plain error

claim, is it of some consequence that if the error wasn't so
plain that the counsel in the case didn’t see it?
MR. WILCOX:

That is correct, your Honor and as I

say, in this particular situation, I can only speak from my
experience in this particular case.

This was the very

first case I participated in as trial attorney, as this is
the first case I have participated in here.
course.

But our

No excuse, of

defense was one that we did not

participate either as the robber or as the possessor.
Perhaps v;e still should have had the duty to
request this particular charge.
QUESTION:

Well, then, do you think in those

circumstances the prosecutor should be required to elect
before the case is tried which count he is going to stand on?
MR. WILCOX:

Either before the case is tried or

before the case is submitted to the jury, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Did you move for a dismissal of all

charges at the close of the evidence?
MR. WILCOX:

Yes, we did.

We made a motion for

a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecutiorfs
case and also at the conclusion of the case as a whole.

33

If I might comment on the facts in this case —
one brief comment befoi'e beginning my argument — that is,
the facts as stated by Counsel Prey certainly ware clear
arid accurate in this case.

But at the actual trial of this

case, the only evidence that connected either Gaddis or
Birk with the robbery of this bank in Loganville, Georgia,
was the testimony this codefendant gave.
In other words, there was no independent evidence
to otherwise connect them with the robbery of the bank.
QUESTION:
MR. V7ILC0X:

Where was the money found?
The

interestingly enough, the

money was found in the possession of the wife of Mr. Davis,
the codefendant.
a bank.

She had took some of the marked money to

Kent to her house and

the remainder of the money, or a portion of the money was
found in her deep freeze, if the Court, will.

But none of

the money, neither masks, guns, nor any independent
identification was ever as to Gaddis and Birk at the trial
of this particular case.
With the Court's permission I will present two
arguments in support of Respondents’ position before this
case.
First, this Court’s decision in Milanovich v.
United States, which is applicable to the case at bar in
our viev;, is an appropriate statement of the lav; where a

defendant is charged and convicted both of taking and
receiving the same property.
Second, any suggestion that an appellate court
remedy the error that was committed in the trial court by
ordering the trial court to either dismiss the taking
conviction or the possession conviction is improper in our
view, whether under the guise of some rule of priority or
what has become known as the concurrent sentence doctrine.
The Petitioner has properly stated the rule
enunciated by this Court in Milanovich and, again, that rule
simply says that where the Government chooses to indict
both for robbery and for possession, then it is the duty or
it is incumbent upon the trial judge to give an either/or
instruction.
Further, given Heflin v. United States, the
rationale of this Milanovich decision X3 appropriate to
this case wherein these particular defendants were charged
and convicted under the federal bank robbery' statute.
However, in his argument here today, the Petitioner
attempts to distinguish the case at bar on the facts and
thereby take it out from under the purview of Milanovich.
In our view, the factual pattern in these two
cases is much the same, especially when viewed with a look,
toward the activities of the driver of the getaway car.
To point up what happens in a case and in our

35
opinion why the Government would choose to indict both for
robbery and for possession, I cite this Court's attention
to a recent Eighth Circuit case, Dixon versus United States,
507 Federal Second 683.
In that case there were three robbers.
the getaway car.

One drove

He was indicted and that was Dixon.

A

mistrial was declared as to the robbery but he was found
guilty as to the possession.
That particular panel concluded that the nocharge was given but it was harmless error given the verdict
and the comment was that the driver of the getaway car
acted only as an aider and

abettor to the robber and there­

fore, it can be conceptualized as a separate offense.
This discussion of the distinction between the
two engenders, we think, a consideration of whether
this was a single

or net

transaction or two separate transactions.

QUESTION:

Did the driver

of this car take a shot

at the policeman?
MR. WILCOX:

The evidence educed at the trial,

given Davis' testimony, was that, as I recall., the driver
of the getaway car did fire at the policeman when he
arrived at the scene.
QUESTION:

Do you think that makes cmy difference

as to whether he was a participant in the robbery?
MR. WILCOX:

I do not, your Honor, certainly the

3 ei

separate charge of assault as to the driver of the getaway
charge [car] would have been proper.
QUESTION:

The man who guides the robbers inside

the bank is not a party to the robbery?
MR. WILCOX:

Under an aiding and abetting charge,

which they had, certainly a jury could return that type of
verdict.

I have no quarrel with that.

But juries do

return verdicts saying that drivers of getaway cars — as
evidenced by the Dixon case — are —
QUESTION:

But that is a lesser included offense

verdict, isn't it?
MR. WILCOX:

Not really, your Honor.

Certainly,

given the legislative history of 2113(c) the possession is
only — is a

separate offense and contemplates separate

people.
QUESTION:

Oh, no, I am talking about the driver

of the car.
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
You mean, the only people guilty of

the robbery are those inside the bank?
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:
MR, WILCOX:

No, your Honor.
Well, what are you saying?
I am not taking that position.

I am

saying that under the facts in this case whan looking at
the driver of the getaway car, there really is no

37

distinction between this particular case and the case of the
Milanovich situation where the lady there drove the getav/av
car to the scene.
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

Well, she didn't shoot anybody.
She did not shoot anybody, that is

true and if, in fact, we consider that an assault charge
then it would be proper that it is a separate count.
QUESTION:

Well, weren't these men in this case

charged with assault?
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:

They were.
Well, he was guilty of that then.,

wasn't he?
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

That is correct, given the facts.
Wall, I have lost your point.
Well, the point is simply this,

that in our position whether or not it is a single transac­
tion or two transactions is of no import and that the
Milanovich situation and the rule of law there was a rule
or a rationale that is applicable to these types of cases
whether or not it is a single transaction or two
transactions.
1 mentioned the Dixon case only to show the Court,

if I might, that the reason for the possession count often­
times is, in fact, juries do return verdicts wherein a
person is found guilty of possession and not robbery even

38

though he drove the getaway car and waited for the robbers
to return.

A similar case is a Fifth Circuit case, Baker

v. United States,
drives the car.

with the very same facts.

The man

He waits for the robbers to go in.

He

identifies a car in the parking lot, steals it and drives
the robbers away.
Thera, that particular case, no either/or instruc­
tion was given and the case was remanded for a new trial.
QUESTION:

Is this an argument that under the

statute it is simply not possible to break this into the
.separate offenses of this kind, it is one offense and
therefore you can't indict on separate counts, one for
the robbery and one for the possession?
MR. WILCOX:

Yes, your Honor, you can indict but

the point is, of course, that the jury should be instructed
before they retire that given the history of this particular
statute under which these men were charged, that they have
the choice to first of all determine whether or not these
folks are robbers and if they are, fine, they cannot also
be convicted of possession because that is a separate person.
QUESTION:

No matter what may be the length of

time between the date of the robbery and the incident which
led to the possession charge?
MR. WILCOX:
would be my --

7wid that is what Heflin

said.

Heflin

said that the possession count was directed coward a wholly
different kind of defendant, a person who was not the

40
robber.

Isn't that what Heflin said?
MR. WILCOX:

That is correct, your Honor, and

certainly they were — this Court relied on the legislative
history of that statute when they rendered that opinion.
And I might add, as far as the facts are concerned in this
case on that particular point, while Mr. Davis chose to
identify Mr. Gaddis as the driver of a car, the evidence
at the trial of the case was that Billy Sunday Bird had a
very serious speech impediment and had had, through the
testimony of numerous — several people throughout his life
and it is possible that that particular jury decided that
yes, these two men were involved but may have decided that
Bird was, in fact, driving the car.

This is only a

conjecture on my part but is the real reason that we are
here today, is whether or not wa want to look behind what the
jury decided.
These facts presented to this Court in
coolness of this

the

hour appears to be just open and closed.

This particular jury was out for six and one-half hours.
This appears to be a clear case but certainly in
the state court for the State of Georgia, where a man cannot
be convicted on the uncoHaborated testimony of a codefenderfc,
this case may not have even gotten to the jury.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no question what the

jury decided with respect to the individual counts, is there?

41
MR. WILCOX:

That is correct, your Honor.

My

only point was that there is —
QUESTION:

Well, they made separate — returned

separate verdicts on the different counts, each count.
MR. WILCOX:

They did.

There is some concern in

my mind whether or not the jury decided it was Birt or Gaddis
driving the car.

That was my point, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, your point is, in

any event,

the jury, under this statute, could have convicted on these
facts of robbery or nothing.
MR. WILCOX:

That is correct, your Honor.

The question is, what remedy to be applied in this
case, given the error permitted.
We concede that the lower courts during this
interval between 1961 and today’s date have attempted various
methods to avoid the new trial mandate of Milanovich.
It is interesting to note the case pointed out by
Mr. Frey that Mr. Justice Clarke sat on in the Fourth
Circuit, there, Sellers, the defendant, four counts of
robbery and possession and he was convicted and when the
instruction wa3 not given, and the appellate court there
decided that the remedy should be that the case would go
back to the trial court and there the prosecution could
elect whether or not they would let the possession or lesser
sentence stand or whether or not they would seek to have a

42

new trial.
QUESTION:

Why do you think. — or do you think

that is not a proper solution?
MR. WILCOX:

It is not, your Honor, because I

have the fear that what has been done there is that an
appellite court there has looked at the facts.

They are

really — I art almost arguing for fairness on behalf of the
Government and that the appellate court has decided that
this man was guilty of possession but was not guilty of
robbery and my fear is, of course, on balance, that if it
sent back and said, "Drop the possession.

They are guilty

of robbery," there again, we have in some way usurped the
authority of the jury which is what this case is all about,
in my opinion.
But the Sellers case also concerns me but is one
way appellate coux-ts have looked at this problem and
certainly the Tyler case in the Ninth Circuit — there, the
appellate court said, well, we have a sentence here of six
years for possession and six years for robbery.

So under

the concurrent sentence doctrine wo will not even look at
this particular case.
QUESTION:

And why do you say the concurrent

sentence doctrine is not applicable here?
MR. WILCOX:

For a number of reasons.

I have a

real question and only this Court can know, after the Benton

43

case — Benton v. Maryland — the real thrust of the con­
current sentence approach at this point but I think
certainly here there was a general sentence.

Concurrent

sentence cases have not gone to where there is a general
sentence.
Second of all, as in the recent case —
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that a correctable item

on a remand, though?
MR. WILCOX:

Yes, it is, your Honor.

We could go

back and have the trial judge break down the particular year
on each statute.

That would be simple enough and would

correct that objection.
QUESTION:

Do you think that would be an

appropriate solution?
MR. WILCOX:

Not to bring it under

concurrent

sentence doctrine, your Honor, because in. this particular
case, as in United States v. Belt, a very recent case in
the Eighth Circuit, 516 Federal Second, page 73, the court
there concluded that the concurrent sentence doctrine lacks
propriety where the crimes charged are various and are
serious and differing in substance and the possibility of
collateral effects

is what that particular court went tc

and certainly, the concurrent sentence doctrine concludes
that there is one valid account and, of course, the area
here, we say, gees to both counts.

44

QUESTION:

Well, what if it goes back and the

with instructions that the court acquit on the possession
charge, period?
MR. WILCOX:

The objection would be, Mr. Justice;,

that the same fear that this Court had in Milanovich would
be, of course, evidenced, and that is, that an appellate
court had decided which offense these particular men were
guilty of.
And we still have the

question of whether or not

a correctly-instructed jury would have returned a verdict
of possession.
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

What more do you want than that?
We want a new trial.

In this particular case?
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:

Yes.
That is correct, your Honor.
You want a new trial.

You were satisfied

with the trial at the time of the verdict, weren't you?
You accepted the verdict.
MR. WILCOX:

Well, certainly, we made a motion

for a judgment of acquittal after the evidence was educed
at trial and then again —
QUESTION:

Did you cite the failure to give the

either/or instruction in that?
MR. WILCOX:

No, we did not, your Honor.

45
QUESTION:

So as far as that was concerned, you

were satisfied.
MR. WILCOX;

That is correct.

At the time.

Our main fear is, of course, as I have already
pointed out, that given the decision in Milanovich, and
given the decision in Heflin, we find nothing to take this
case out from under the purview of those two decisions and
by the 3ame token, the majority of appellate courts in the
interim years have given this same set of facts, remanded
the case for a new trial, and the Fifth Circuit alone,
there have been four or five cases in particular on the
same facts that have been remanded for a new trial.
And, certainly, the proposition that the Government
offers, that in some way this case should be sent back to
a jury and the jury be instructed that these two particular
defendants are guilty of something, either possession or
robbery, and it is your duty to find either/or, I find no
precedent for that.
QUESTION:

Well, one can reject that, I take it,

without necessarily feeling that the thing ought to be sent
back for a new trial at all.
J

.Do you think it makes much sense in the adminis­
tration of justice v,rhen a jury has found these clients of
yours guilty on the two separate counts, to simply say they
are entitled to a new trial on both counts?

46

MR. WILCOX:

Yes, I do, your Honor, simply from the

standpoing of a rule of law because if, in fact, we decide
or a court decides that there was a distinction to be made
here, robbery authorization — and we will make that now,
given this record, that

this is a beginning of a usurption

of the juryfefunction, which was fact finding.
QUESTION:

Well, but all the jury did was found

facts and it seems to me that Heflin and Milanovlch don’t
say anything more than as a matter of law, not as a matter
of fact, these two offenses can’t subsist side by side and
so your client is getting a good deal if he is let off the
hook on either one of them, is what it boils down to.
MR. WILCOX:

Certainly, that is a hard proposition

to argue with if, in fact, as in the Sellers case, the case
is returned as the Government argued before the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Their contention there was, drop the robbery count
and resentence these two particular defendants on the
possession count.
I would not concede that point but —
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX;

You’d rather have that than vice-versa.
That is correct, your Honcr.

Certainly we had rather have a return of the case and up­
holding the possession as opposed to dismissing the
possession, as the Government now suggests would be proper,

47
and leaving intact the robbery conviction.
QUESTION:

Is there some suggestion that Davis

now refuses to testify at any new trial?
MR. WILCOX:
question in this way.

Your Honor, let me respond to that
Certainly, to give the Court a little

edification about these particular parties as it is germane
to our discussion here today, there is not much question
that Mr. Davis will testify against Mr. Birk and Mr. Gaddis
in our opinion and that since the trial of this case as to
these two particular defendants — and certainly, I am here
to discuss a rule of law — Mr. Davis has testified in a
trial, a murder trial, charging both Gaddis and Birk with
a double murder.

They were convicted in that trial and now

have been given a death sentence, two death sentences in the
State of Georgia and of course, that case is on mandatory
appeal in the state court.
QUESTION:

Was that a crime committed before this

one?
MR. WILCOX:

Yes, it was, your Honor, and of

course, Mr. Davis participated in that particular trial.
I know your Honor is concerned with the footnotes
that the Government has put in several briefs before this
Court.

Mr. Davis now has said that he would not testify.

But I can only give you my opinion on this, that he had no
reluctance to testify in the state court.

48

hs a matter of fact, I an informed at this point
now that the Government seeks help from Gaddis to implicate
Davis in some crimes in that general area and this all goes
to really, of course, who Mr. Davis really is.
QUESTION:

It sounds like a good part of Georgia

to stay away from.
MR. WILCOX:

Well, your Honor began the discussion

with a question of my not objecting or asking for the
either/or instruction.

1 might add in that vein, Mr. Davis'

attorney at this particular trial was also indicted for
murder with Birt and Gaddis and since, in substance to that,
the district attorney, I understand, has certainly decided
not to prosecute in that there is nothing to connect the
attorney but Mr. Davis was dissatisfied with his repre­
sentation so — yes, your Honor, I have reason to question
Mr. Davis.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Court does not agree with

you that a new trial is required but that the defendant may
be sentenced foi only one of the crimes.

Do you make a
•

i.-

.

separate point that there must be resentencing here or justcancellation of the one sentence?
MR. WILCOX:

The proper method, your Honor, in

my opinion, if the Court concluded that

that would be

proper, would be to remand this case to the —
QUESTION:

Well, why, the sentences were separate

49

on each count?
MR. WILCOX:

In the end, the court concluded that

this was a general sentence of 25 years and that all of these
counts merged and of course, subsection —
QUESTION:

Yes, but he did sentence separately

on those.
MR. WILCOX:

He did sentence separately ten years

for the possession and then had them merged.

I certainly

can find no objection but —
QUESTION:

What is a "merged?"

Is there a legal

basis for that or is that just the way they discuss sentences
in that part?
MR. WILCOX:

The courts have considered — of

course, the legislative history of the statute says that
they cannot run consecutive so several courts concluded
after the passage of this statute that subsections (a),

(b)

and (d), for purposes of sentencing, were all merged into
the sentence, the most severe sentence, 25 years was proper.
That is the terminology but of course, the same
courts have said that subsection (c), the possession count,
will not merge.
And, of course, to completely answer the Justice's
question about retrial, as to these two particular defendants,
there is some doubt if, in fact, this Court concluded that a
new trial was warranted, given the two trials that I have

50

just alluded to, whether or not these two particular
defendants would be given a new trial.
My point here today is that we have an issue of
law and I am here to discuss only that and I

want to make

that clear, if I might.
In concluding, Milanovich v. United States is a
sound decision and is appropriate, in my opinion, for
consideration here.
We respectfully submit that this Court, one,
should not overrule that decision and second of all, should
not in some way formulate a procedural cure for the error
that was committed at the trial court and that, rather,
this case should be remanded for a new trial under the
purview of Milanovich and Heflin.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?
MR. FREY:

Just one or two points.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L.VrEY, ESQ.
V:;

MR. FFEY:

With respect to Justice Brennan's

question about whether the statute didn't indicate that
there should be, rather than this equal either/or instruction,
perhaps a priority instruction that asks the jury first to
consider robbery ~
QUESTION:

Well, I had

that in mind, Mr. Frey,

51
because of what was said in Heflin.
MR. FREY:

Right.

Well, Heflin —

QUESTION;

Helfin, really, was a construction of

the applicable statute, wasn't it?
MR. FREY:
construction.

Yes.

It certainly was a statutory

What is not clear is whether the thrust of

Heflin wa3 to the pyramid of punishment that existed in
Heflin or whether it was to the entry of dual conviction.
QUESTION:

Well, I was thinking of the next-to-

the last page and the top of the last page in which
Mr. Justice Douglas —

offenders.

MR. FEEY:

Yes, he has made both points —

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FPEY:

— that it was a separate class of

My point is that, in effect, counsel concedes

away his case here, to agree with your suggestion, because
if it is true that the jury will look first to consider
robbery and if it finds the defendant guilty of robbery,
?

?

then prater mit it's consideration of the possession or
receipt offense, then the remedy surely is simply to vacate
the possession conviction but not, certainly, to grant a
new trial.
QUESTION:

Well, would the Government interest be

adequately protected if the jury was instructed to return
a verdict on only one of these counts —

52

MR. FREY:

I —

QUESTION:

Now, wait a minute.

Suppose it was

instructed that if you find these people guilty of robbery,
bank robbery, return no verdict on the possession count.
MR. FREY:

Well, that would certainly be better

than returning an acquittal on the possession count.

That

would at least theoretically leave the possession count open
but the question is, why, as a matter of sound judicial
administration, should the jury be told that?
QUESTION:

Why should —

And then, if you had both counts in

the indictment, you would just tell the jury that you don't
that if you find, unless you find the person guilty of
robbery, ycu may convict him of possession, if the evidence
warrants it.
MR. FREY:

But the robbery conviction may be

ultimately overturned for reasons that would not infect a
possession conviction and it seems to me a3 a matter of
sound administration of justice you allow the jury to
return verdicts on both and then it is the judge who enters
no judgment of conviction on the possession count but only
on the robbery count.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me, then, you are

disagreeing with the construction of the statute that the
court has adopted in Milanovich, namely, that there isn't
any crime of-possession on the part of one who robs.

53

MR. FREY:

No, no.

All that I am saying is that,

that at law there is no crime of possession for one who
robs, but —
QUESTION:

That is what I am talking about, the

law, and that is what instructions do, is state the lav/.
MR. FREY:

No, I don’t think that is correct in

this case because whether or not somebody is one who robs
is only determined at the conclusion

of the litigation and

possibly even amenable to collateral attack at that point.
QUESTION:

Tell me, Mr. Frey, who should be held

guilty — let's suppose you had an indictment that had
separate robbery and possession counts in it.
MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION;

And you instructed the jury that if

you find the person guilty of robbery,
guilty of possession.

do not find him

But you may find him guilty of

possession if you don’t find him guilty of robbery.
Now, you tell me what people you think the
Government ought to be able to hold guilty of possession
who wouldn't be covered by the second count on possession.
MR. FREY:
question.

I am not sure that I understand the

I -- I —
QUESTION:

Well, you are saying that there are

three crimes involved now in the statute, one is a class of
persons who have just received.

But then there are two

54
crimes that may be committed by another group of people,
either they possess or they rob.
No, I don't — we don't challenge the

MR. FREY:

ultimate conclusion that ultimately one who is convicted of
robbery ought not to have a conviction on his record for
possession but we are saying that as a matter of the
administration of justice, you ought to let the jury find
the facts.

In most cases you will have quite separate

evidence of possession independent of the evidence of
robbery and if you don't have the jury return the verdict
with respect to that, you run the risk of having to have a
later trial or having double jeopardy objections if there
is something wrong with the robbery conviction that wouldn't
taint the possession conviction.
It is only one who is convicted cf robbery who
is immune from possession.

It is not one who is a robber.

It is only one who is convicted of robbery who is immune
from the possession conviction.
That is, we strenuously disagree and we have a
petition pending before the Court in the Phillips case that
you cannot set up as a defense to a possession charge that,
you are a robber.

It is only after conviction that the

preclusion of the possession charge comes into play in our
view.
Thank you.
