PRO CEKDI_NGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll now hear No. 75-88

Mathews against Lucas.
Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please the

Court:
This case, like the one just argued, arises from the
Secretary’s denial of insurance, child’s insurance benefits, to
the illegitimate children of a deceased wage-earner, on the
ground that the wage-earner had not been supporting or living
with the children at the time of his death.
In this case, however, the claimants brought suit for
review only of the Secretary’s specific denial of benefits to
them.

They did not request either injunctive or class relief.
The district court sustained the Secretary’s findings

as supported by substantial evidence, but, nevertheless,
reversed, without issuing an injunction, the denial of benefits
on the ground that the statutory eligibility requirement of
support or co~residence denied illegitimate children due process
under the Fifth Amendment.
Since, in so holding, the district court held the
statute ~~ held an Act of Congress unconstitutional, this Court

4
plainly has jurisdiction under Section 1252 of the Judicial
Code .
Proper analysis of this case requires a full under­
standing of the statutory scheme for the distribution of child's
insurance benefits»
dependency.

The formal linchpin of that scheme is

Under Section 202(d)(1)(C) of the Social Security

Act, payment of child's insurance benefits are made only on
behalf of the dependent children of disabled, retired or
deceased wage-earners.
However, the Act presumes dependency as a matter of
law for most children.

As to legitimate children, the Act

presumes dependency if the child has not been adopted by
another wage-earner.
Dependency is also presumed with regard to four
categories of illegitimate children.

First, children whose

parents went through a marriage ceremony that was rendered
invalid by a non-obvious legal impediment? second,

children

whose father acknowledged paternity in writing? third, children
whose father's paternity was decreed by court? and, fourth,
children whose father was ordered by a court to contribute to
their support.
Dependency is not presumed with regard to other
illegitimate children or to legitimate children who are —
legitimate adopted children who are seeking benefits on behalf
or their natural parents' social security account.

5
In order to be entitled to child’s insurance benefits,
these latter categories of children must prove that the wageearner was in fact their father and also that their father was
living with or contributing to their support at the time of
death.
Now, it's the constitutional validity of this
statutory classification that is at issue in this case.
The Appellees here, the Lucas children, are children who must
prove dependency as a condition of eligibility for child's
insurance benefits under the Act.

And they challenge that

requirement as a denial of due process under the Fifth
Amendment.
At the outset of this case, it is necessary to address
the question of the appropriate standard of review, and with
the Court’s indulgence, I propose to approach this question in
a largely philosophical..manner.
The briefs in both, this and the preceding case, the
Norton case, proceed upon the premise that the two-tiered
equal protection analysis that evolved in the late 19608s
still governs the adjudication of equal protection cases.
And upon reflection I have concluded that this premise is
probably erroneous.
This Court appears in large part to have abandoned
the two-tiered equal protection analysis and, I think, for
good reasons.

6

The development of a two-tiered equal protection
analysis appears to have been an interim judicial response to
the perceived failure of the traditional rational basis test
sufficiently to protect certain disadvantaged groups, and to
vindicate certain important interests, when this Court determined
that statutes adversely affecting such groups or impinging upon
such interests would be subjected to very close judicial
scrutiny and would be sustained only if they satisfied or
serve a compelling governmental interest.
QUESTION;

Do you happen to know where that phrase

first was used?
MR. JONES;

Compelling governmental interest?

No,

but I think it -QUESTION;

I think it was in the Cramer case, which

was in 1969 — would that be right?
MR. JONES:

I'm not sure of the date.

QUESTION;

The voting rights case in New York, the

voting disqualification case in New York.
I 'think I'm correct in that.

However, go ahead;

That was just used as a phrase,

V/as n't it, —

That's correct.
not as a doctrine.
Rut it became one, I think.
That's right.

That's what happens to

7

MR. JONES:

But other classifications continued to

be reviewed under the traditional rational basis test, which
required only a minimal showing of rationality.
And this two-tiered approach had a lot of obvious
difficulties to it.

One of these was in knowing to which tier

a particular case belonged.

Outside the area of race, there

appeared to be no availability constitutional standards for
defining suspectness.

That is, for selecting the groups with

respect to whom statutory classifications would be considered
inherently suspect.
Similarly, -there are few, if any, constitutional
guideposts for determining what interests are so important as
to be fundamental.
Another difficulty with the two-tiered analysis is
that it has never been easy to articulate an adequate
constitutional justification for the dramatic gap that existed
between the -two levels of equal protection review „
QUESTION:

You don't take the Caroline Products

footnote as an article of faith, then?

In what sense an article of faith, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist?

case?

The footnote in the Caroline Products

8

QUESTION:

It wasn't an equal protection footnote; it

was a First Amendment footnote.
QUESTION:

Before, it wasn’t either.

[Laughter.]
MR. JONES:

It would be of assistance to counsel —

QUESTION:

And your opinion.

[Laughter. ]
MR. JONES:

— if these cryptic comments could be

made more explicit.
QUESTION:

I withdraw my question.

[Laughter. 3
MR. JONES:

At any rate, with considerations such as

those I have just indicated in mind, perhaps in mind, the Court
has, it seems to me, preceptibly and gradually altered its
approach to equal protection cases.
First, in the recent past it has resisted attempts by
litigants to add new classifications to the suspect list of
the higher tier.
But second, and perhaps more importantly, in many
punitively lower-tier cases, the Court has departed from the
traditional rational basic test by requiring a more persuasive
showing than in the past that the means chosen by the legis­
lature serve an actual and permissible legislative objective.
In particular, this stronger showing has been
required where the challenged statutory classification defined

9

the class in such a manner as to create the suspicion that the
legislature nay have been discriminating against it, against
the class without just cause.
In this latter development of a stricter rational
basis standard of review, in large part, has rendered the twotiered analysis obsolete.
Accordingly, I think it is unrealistic for the
Appellees here to insist upon a compelling governmental interest
standard of review.

But, by the same token, since this case

concededly involves a class of individuals that historically
has been subjected to social obliquity and to invidious treatment
by State Legislatures.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

And that has no .political power in it.
That's correct.
*

I think it's equally unrealistic for the government
to insist upon the minimal scrxriiny of the traditional rational
basis test in this case.

And I would anticipate that in a case

such as tills, the Court would carefully review the challenged
statutory classification.
QUESTION:
this now?

Where do you put McGowan y« rMaryland in

Your terminology has got me a little bit confused.
MR. JONES:

McGowan v, Maryland did not, as I recall,

involve discrimination or —
QUESTION;
minimal?

Yes, but which test I am speaking of,

10
Is McGowan v. Maryland what you think of as -the
minimal scrutiny;, and minimal rational
JONES:

That's correct.

And I am not suggesting

that the minimal scrutiny test has lost all force, but, .rather,
I am suggesting that in practice the Court has departed from that
test in cases involving classes of individuals as to whom there
may be some founded suspicion that they would be subject to
invidious treatment by the Legislature.
A statutory classification that did not classify
people according to any characteristics that would normally
define a class that would be subject to social mistreatment,
who would, I think, be subject to the traditional rational
basis standard of review.
QUESTION:

How about mortgage holders out in

Minnesota in 1335, that Blazius vs. Minnesota Savings and Loan?
MR. JONES;

I think that kind of economic legislation

which does not impinge upon a group that is definable in
invidious terras would be subject to minimal —
QUESTION:

What do you mean by definable in

invidious te rms ?
MR. JONES: Well, frankly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
I think that, the class -that we're concerned with here, the class
of illegitimate children, is one that has been subject to
invidious treatment by
QUESTION:

What do you mean by "invidious"?

11
MR. JONES:

Enactments that express moral, disappro-

val of the status of illegitimate children.
QUESTION;

Don't you think that mortgage holders out

in Minnesota in '35 were subjected to that same kind of treat­
ment?
MR. JONES;

I would not have thought so.

QUESTION:

Well, there were farmers with pitchforks

on the courthouse doors , preventing the laws from being
enforced.

As recited in the court’s opinion.
QUESTION;

Perhaps what you're saying is that they

were not historically, for such a long period of time, subjected
to a continuous pattern, as illegitimate children who couldn’t
inherit and who couldn't do a lot of other things.
MR. JONES:

Well, really, what I’m trying to do is

simply to state what I think has become the law.

I would have

said that discrimination of that kind is not discrimination
against historically disadvantaged class? at the same time#
it's quite clear that the Court has started applying a different
rule than the minimal scrutiny test in some cases, and what
I’m trying to do is just to describe what I think is a practical
matter as the rule in this case.
And that rule, I would think, would, be that ~
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, Mr. Jones, that

you're reading into some of the decisions, particularly die
recent ones, a spectrum of strict scrutiny at one end and pure

12
minimal at the other, and a sliding scale in between?
MR. JONES:

Well, about a year ago I argued a case

called Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld -QUESTION:

I recall that you did.

MR. JONES:

— and, I won't make any comments as to

•the outcome, but it seemed to me to reflect —
QUESTION:

It was unanimous.

[Laughter] *
MR. JONES:

The result was.

It seemed to reflect the application of a standard
of review that was stricter than that which I had argued for
at the time. That is, stricter than the minimal scrutiny that
had traditionally been applied to social —QUESTION; And yet not the so-called compelling
interest.
MR. JONES:

That’s right.

The Court did not, by

terms, require the showing of a compelling governmental interest)'
and I would hope that in such cases the Court would not, and
that if a sufficiently strong showing -that Congress had an
actual and legitimate objective in mind can be made, then the
Court would sustain it.
QUESTION: Well, one of your objections, though, to
the two-tiered test, you say, is the difficulty of deciding
which tier something goes into.
three tiers.

Nov; you’re, in effect, proposing

Wouldn’t that just compound the difficulty of

13
deciding what tier something goes into?
MR. JONES:

It certainly complicates matters for both

litigants and legislatures.
also complicated it.

I think that the two-tier test

I'm not really proposing anything,, but if

I can predict something,. I would predict that the Court might
be tending toward formulation of a rule that might embrace a
large number of cases and give more guidance to the Court.
I think right now we're in a position, frankly, where
litigants and legislatures really don't know just what they can
do.

And maybe that will always be the case, as long as you

have an intervention as approach to the equal protection clause.
What I am recognizing now is that we do have such an
approach in these cases.
At any rate, I would anticipate that the Court would
apply a test similar to that that was applied in Wiesenfald.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, could you help me?

I under­

stand you to be saying it should be a somewhat — with the
discrimination between legitimates and illegitimates, the test
should be more strict than a rational basis test.

Would you

tell me what the test is that you propose?
MR. JONES:

Well, I'm not saying, Mr. Justice Stevens,

that it should be.
QUESTION;

That you think it is —

MR. JONES:

What I'm saying is that —

QUESTION s

You think that's the way the lav/ has

14
developed,
MR, JONES:

And how this Court is going to — what I

am positive is the standard that I think is likely this Court
will use in evaluating the constitutionality of the statute.
QUESTION;

That's what I wanted.

Would you phrase for

me what your understanding is of what the law is with respect
to the appropriate standard for this kind of case?
MR. JONES;

Yes.

I would assume that constitution-

ality of the requirement that these illegitimate children prove
dependency would be sustained if, and only if, it is shown that
i

that requirement further is an actual and permissible legis­
lative objective.
And the question in this case is whether the denial
of benefits to this sub-class does in fact serve an actual and
permissible legislative objective.
I would make an important preliminary point at the
outset.

This standard of review rules out one mode of analysis,

and I think that should be made clear.
It is not acceptable to ascribe a broad purpose to the
statutory scheme that is in fact inconsistent with the challenged
provisions, and then to hold the provision is unconstitutional
because they do not further that purpose.
An example of what I have in mind is contained in the
Appellant's brief in Norton,

where it is argued that because

the Social Security Act is intended to operate in a humanitarian

15

manner, it should strain a court’s

credibility to lay at

Congress’s door an intent to deny benefits to Appellant's class,
Nov;, with all due respect to opposing counsel, that
line

of argument is simply nonsense.

It overlooks the fact

that Congress has in fact expressly denied benefits to this
class, and therefore cannot strain any court's credibility to
lay that intent, the intent expressly stated in the statute, at
Congress's door.
A complexity of the legislative process requires a
more subtle and comprehensive analysis of the statute.
The question to be asked in a case like this is not
whether the denial of benefits to this class furthers the
broad social welfare purpose of the statute, but, rather, the
question that I would anticipate would be asked is:

Why did .

Congress choose to deny benefits to this class?
Now, Congress had ■— if Congress reasonably believed
that defying benefits to this class would serve an actual and a
permissible legislative objective, then I would think the
statute should be sustained.
Nov;, I can conceive of —
QUESTION:

Well, does this suggest, though, that

Congress has to point out what its objective was?
MR. JONES 3

Well, again, in Wfesenfeld, I was

surprised to learn that that was the requirement, that Congress
was .required to spell out in the legislative history what its

16

purposes were, and then the provisions of the statute had to
satisfy those purposes.,

That had not been the rule under the

traditional rational basin test.

Rut that was the approach

that the Court took in Wiesenfeld, as I understood.
Nov;, I can conceive of three possible rationale for
the statute.
QUESTION;

Let me ask you one question, Mr. Jones.

You say that the purpose must have been an actual one on the
part of Congress, and that this particular legislation must
have furthered it.

So that we sit, in effect, and say, Do we

agree with the legislative judgment having had this purpose in
mind, that -this particular section furthered that purpose?
Well, can you — I can’t imagine a more complete
method of simply second-guessing the legislature.
MR. JONES;

Well, if —

QUESTION;

If they had that in mind, this general

purpose, and enacted this statute which, in their view,
furthered it, we 'would then be sitting here and say;

Given

that purpose, we think what you chose to further it didn't
further it.
MR. JONES:

Well, I think that a lot of leeway has to

be given to judging whether a classification in fact furthers
the purpose.

But if it can be shown that the classification is

plainly irrational in terms of any perceivable legislative
purpose, then it has been the recent attitude of this Court

17
that even if maybe some other conceivable ptirpose could have
been imagined# nevertheless# the statute will not be upheld.
But there are inevitable -- pardon?
QUESTION;

What# beside Wiesenfeld# would you suggest

indicated that?
MR. JONES;

?
?
Well# I think that the Murray and Moreno

Food Stamp cases of three years ago are similar examples.
Where, under the minimal scrutiny of the traditional rational
basis test I 'would have thought that those statutory classificei™
tions could be sustained.
But the Court
QUESTION;

Bo you get that out of the opinion or do

you — is that what you surmize?
MR. JONES;

A lot of it is surmize.

I've forgotten

now# it's been some time since I read the Moreno opinion.
QUESTION;

You might go a step further and suggest

that the Court return to what was pretty well settled
constitutional lav; for a hundred years or so, the equal pro™
tection clause was the last refuge of a desperate constitutional
lawyer.
MR. JONES;
Stewart.

That would be fine with me, Mr. Justice

But I would like to make the arguments that I think

actually sustain the statute \mder the approach that I
anticipate would be followed hare.
I would say that one possible legislative objective,

18

I think, would be eliminated completely at the outset, and that
is that Congress did not devise this statutory scheme simply to
invidiously discriminate against illegitimates.

There's nothing

in the legislative history that suggests that the statutory
classification was motivated by congressional hostility to
illegitimates.
Moreover, the extension of the presumption of
dependency in this case to four categories of illegitimates,
and the withhwlding of it from the category of legitimate
children, would refute, I would think, any suggestion that the
statutory pattern itself reveals a purpose of invidious
discrimination.
Therefore, tills is not a case, arguably, like Levy or
Glona, where the legislative objective was the impermissible
one of expressing moral disapproval of the status of illegiti­
macy .
Now, two other legislative objectives that I think
should be considered;

One clearly supports the constitutionality

of the statute? and ‘the other appears not to do so.
And I will take up these in reverse order, quickly, if
I can.
It seems to me that the private claimant's best
argument, here begins with the contention that the legislative
objective was to restrict the payment of benefits to children,
whether or not actually dependent, who had a legal right to be

19

supported by the wage-earner»

And that would, of course, be a

permissible legislative objective»

And although the evidence

is conflicting, there is some arguable basis for that view in
the legislative history»

But their argument proceeds, as I

understand it, that the statutory scheme nay have been
constitutional at the time of enactment, but that the premise
on which it was based was undone by this Court's decision in
Gomes: v. Perez, where it was held that the State must grant an
illegitimate child the same right to support from his father as
is possessed by a legitimate child.
And under this line of reasoning, since the members
of the complainant class new have the same right to parental
support as all other children, the denial to them of child's
insurance benefits does not further the original purpose of the
Act, and therefore should not be sustained.

•*

Nov/, tliat I think is a plausible approach to the
problem at hand.

But there is an equally plausible approach

that would sustain its statute, and in -these circumstances,
this Court should, of course, out of deference to Congress,
choose the course that sustains the validity of the statute.
Now, as we point out at pages 32 through 36 of our
brief in the Horton case, there is substantial evidence, both
in the legislative history and directly inferable from the
statutory scheme, that -the purpose of the child's insurance
benefits program is to provide support only for the dependent

20

children of disabled, retired, or deceased wage-earners, and
that the purpose of requiring members of the complainant class
to prove co-residence or support is to restrict the payment of
benefits •— to restrict the payment of benefits to those
children who may reasonably be presumed to have been dependent*
If that is the correct view of the statutory purposes,
and we submit that it is, then the statutory scheme must be
sustained.
It clearly was permissible for Conqress to seek to
restrict the payment of dependency benefits to children who
reasonably could be presumed to be dependent, and the require­
ment that the members of the complainant class prove dependency,
prove support or co-residence, furthers that permissible
legislative objective.
The opposition expressed to this line of reasoning
by the district court in this case was that under that view of
the statutory purposes, the statute is allegedly over-inclusive
and that it grants benefits to some children who are not actually
dependent upon the parental wage-earner.

And I would offer two

answers to the argument of over-inclusivensss.
The first is that the statute is not in fact overinclusive.

And the second is that, in any event, mere over-

inclusiveness is not a sufficient basis for invalidating the
s tatute.
The statute is not over-inclusive in the terms that

21

I have describe; that is, to pay benefits to children who could
reasonably be presumed to have been dependent upon the parental
wage™earner.
As we point out at pages 30 and 39 of our brief in
Morton, and as the district court correctly observed in that
case, it was not unreasonable for Congress to have extended the
presumption of dependency to most legitimate children and to
the four specifically defined categories of illegitimate children.
At the same time, the members of the complainant
class could not reasonably have been presumed to be dependent
upon their fathers, since the statutory purpose is a modest
one of separating those classes as to which the presumption of
dependency is reasonable from those as to which is it not
reasonable.

The statute is not, in fact, over-inclusive in

those terms.
But, finally, even if the statute were deemed overinclusive, because it fails to weed out some non-dependent
children from -the list of beneficiaries, that would not justify
as judicial enlargement of the class of beneficiaries to include
all other non-dependent children as well.
A statute that is over-inclusive but not underinclusive.

That is, a statute that grants benefits to some

persons who are outside the statutory rationale, but does not
deny benefits to any persons who are within the statutory
rationale, should not, except perhaps in the most extraordinary

22

circumstances, be struck down.
The realities of the legislative process,

and the

complexities of administration ordinarily prevent a perfect
matching of legislative purpose and effect,
A permissible legislative purpose, such as the purpose
here of restricting benefits, the children who could reasonably
be presumed to be dependent upon their wage-earner father should
not be abandoned wholesale by the courts merely because -that
purpose has not been carried out by the legislature with
precision.
Accordingly, the statute here, the denial of benefits
to these children, furthers a legitimate and an actual legis­
lative objective which should be sustained.
I would like to reserve my remaining time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Brown.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF C, CHRISTOPHER BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF
MR. BROWN:

OF THE APPELLEES

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
I’d first like to address myself to the proper equal
protection standards that should be applied in this case.
We contend that this class of illegitimate children
meets all the traditional criteria which have been applied to
put this class within the strict scrutiny standard test.

23

On the other hand, it seems quite clear that this,
the P&ndridge vs. Williams test,does not apply here and for the
same reasons it did not apply in the Jimenez case.

The govern­

ment has made no finite resources argument in this case.
Mow, it's not totally important to us as to what label
we put on this case;

is this a strict scrutiny test or is this

a traditional test?
At the very least, we think, that it has to be dealt with
with very high scrutiny, and it's not so imporant as to what
we call it, but it's more important as to what this Court does.
QUESTION:

Well, what's the difference between "hinh

scrutiny" and "strict scrutiny"?
MR. BROWN:

Under strict scrutiny, and I would contend

under scrutiny, if there is indeed a gradient, the illegitimate
children are somewhere at the top end of that gradient.
And the difference would be this -- and people would
be placed along the gradient, I presume — one criteria to place
them upon that would be, are they a class that has no control
over the status

that they are being discriminated against?

That's the case here in illegitimate kids situation.
But, at the very least — and it's net necessary to
get into argument

are they in the strict scrutiny class and

all the way at the top, or are they somewhere approaching that
class?
QUESTION;

Well, how about discrimination against

24

Catholics?

Now, they can becone Protestants tomorrow,

presumably, and change their status.

Would you say that is not,

therefor®, strict scrutiny?
MR. BROWN:

Unless there are First Amendment over­

tones, yes, sir, you're correct, Your Honor.
What this Court has traditionally done, when it has
dealt with either strict scrutiny cases or heightened scrutiny
cases or whatever we may call it — and perhaps sex falls into
this same category — generally speaking, the burden has been
on the government to establish why or what the legitimate pur­
poses of the Act are.
And -that's a very significant fact, because if the
government has to come forth and say something, that means a
lot to the outcome of the case.
Secondly, and I think perhaps Mr. Jones has conceded
tills point, there have to be actual legislative objectives.
Now, in this situation, that would be that Congress has to
actually have articulated in some fashion or another what,
indeed, it did intend.
It's very easy for lawyers, after the fact, —
QU13STI0N:

Well, can't we get that right out of the

words they use, such as the word "dependent"?
MR. BROWN:

Indeed you can? indeed, you can.

And if that’s what they intended, and if they say
we’re on words, that’s the best place to get it, without a

25

doubt.
QUESTION;

That's a pretty good source, isn't it,

the language of the statute?
MR. BROWN;

Indeed it is,

I have no problem with that.

That's the best source, I would guess.
Well, let me — okay, let ma lead in, because that
obviously leads in to what they did intend.
The Congress has sat up the structure, which is
basically as follows;

All legitimate — first of all, everyone

has to prove that an individual was indeed a wage-earner
covered by the Act, employed in so many months and so forth —
so many quarters.
Also they have to apply, also they have to be under
either 18 or 22, and they have to be unmarried.
These are the non-controversial pre-conditions that
have to be met.
There are two major pre-conditions, however; one is
that paternity has to be shown, and the second is that
dependency has to be established.
Now, what the Act does is, it sets up a dependency
requirement, and then it wipes it away for everyone except for
two classes;

one class is the class in this case, a certain

class of illegitimate children; the second class consists of
adopted children and step-children.
Now, there is a special reason for adopted children

26

and step™children to have to establish actual dependency.
Indeed, the fact that they were dependent or supported by the
deceased wage-earner.

And that is because they have two

potential wage-earners upon which to claim benefits.
The adopted child has his natural father that he can claim
benefits upon, or his new adoptive father.

The same goes for

s tep-chiXdren.
Nov;, unfortunately, this class of illegitimate children
has been lumped in with this latter category.

Unforunately,

illegitimate children, much less than having two parents to
look to for support after that parent dies ~~ before he dies,
generally often have no parents at all.
There, therefore, seems to be good reason to require
of adopted children and step-children to prove this, but, I
contend, that there is no reason to require this class of
illegitimate children to prove this.
Nov?, what the court below and what the Secretary has
argued the purpose is is as follows:
That really the Congress, in structuring the Social
Security Act, intended to only replace support that was
actually lost.

That is, they only intended to give benefits to

the children of fathers who actually did support them prior
to the father's death.
He cite in our briefs the rather explicit legislative
history, which seems to counter this notion.

There are two

27
docvunents that say that -the Act intends to give benefits to
those who did receive support prior to their father's death
and those who were owed the obligation to receive support prior
to their father’s death»
We contend that that more clearly articxalates
Congress's reasoning, not just to qive benefits to those who
actually got it, but also to qive benefits to those who were in
a position that they should have actually gotten it, but, for
some reason, their fattier failed to live up to that obligation.
What the district court, below did, in order to add on
to that reason, is that the district court below assumed that
Congress set up a category that those people will not have to
prove actual support before the father died, if it’s more
likely that they indeed were supported.

This is very similar

to Frontiero vs. either Laird or Richardson, that this Court
has encountered before.
In other words, legitimate children are presumed
generally to have been supported, therefore, to save administra­
tive convenience, that category will not have to establish that
they were in fact supported.
Now, our briefs establish that, assuming that indeed
Congress had such a notion ■— which we don’t think they did,
because the congressional history doesn’t seem to indicate that.
If they indeed did have that notion, the Act has very
inarticulately attempted to pursue that purpose.

2(i

There is no guarantee — there are only two studies
that seem to reflect upon this, and both result in ambiguous
conclusions as to whether or not who is more likely than someone
else to have actually been supported prior to death.
Accordingly, it seems highly likely that even if we
assume that Congress did indeed intend to only give benefits
to those people who were actually supported prior to their
death, that they didn't really accomplish that in any meaningful
way.
And I
QUESTION;

To get back to your example of adopted

children and step-children, did I understand you to say that it
was likely they were supported before?
MR. BROWN:

Well, if you're —

QUESTION:

Aren't the parents —-

MR. BROWN:

,If you're an adopted child.

QUESTION;

Aren’t there a lot of adopted children

who are orphans and a lot of step-children who have lost a
parent?
MR. BROWN;

Okay.

The Social Security Administration,

if you're going to adopt a child, and you're not an illegitimate
child in this class, presumes that you were in fact dependent
upon your natural father, and you can automatically — assuming
you prove he’s your father
the Act.

get Social Security benefits under

29
Now, you may also want to attempt to get benefits
under your adoptive father's wage-earner status.

And, in effect,

you can get ’the highest of whichever the two may be.
QUESTION: But you can't get both?
MR. BROWN:

Can’t get both.

You gat idle best of

both worlds, whichever that may be, and we're not complaining
about that.
The problem is they have -— the Act has lumped our
category in with this category that has two potential wageearner sources.
QUESTION:

But you haven't answered my observation

that a lot of these don’t have two potentials.
MR. BROWN:

That is true — that's possibly true,

but —
QUESTION:

Possibly* it is often true, is it not?

I certainly have conducted many an adoption of an
orphan child, anci many an adoption of a step-child without a
male or female parent.
MR. BROWN:

Okay.

I concede -that that is true.

QUESTION:

Well, given that most. States conceal

the identity of illegitimate children, identity of the father
in adoption proceedings, your generalization really doesn't
wash as to illegitimate children.

It's very difficult for an

illegitimate child to find out the identity of the father in
mos t circums tances.

30

MRt BROWN: Find out the identity of his own father?
QUESTION s
HR, BROWN;

Yes„
Well, it is in some circumstances,

I

don't really think it is in most circumstances, Your Honor,
The Act sets out very explicit routes by which you can
establish the paternity of your natural father, even though he
was not married to your mother? and indeed there are difficulties
in pursuing proof of paternity at times.

But the Act doesn’t

seem to be really dealing with that difficulty.
It may be argued, the logical purpose of this
discrimination against illegitimate children could be to bolster
proof of paternity, and therefore avoid fraud.
The district court didn’t find that purpose.

As our

brief indicates, the Secretary who, himself, is the one to whom
you have to prove to his satisfaction paternity, his own internal
claims manual, which is his instructions to people as to hov; to
interpret the Act, it doesn't seem to use it as that purpose.
Prevention of fraud could theoretically be a purpose in this
situation, but Congress hasn't said it, the Secretary hasn't
said it, the district court didn't say it, and the Solicitor
General has alluded to it in the last two pages of his brief,
mildly.
If this is a case that requires some sort of
heightened scrutiny, it wouldn't seem that that sort of a
very evasive and intangible purpose, never articulated by

31
Congress , could indeed bs the legitimate purpose \ipon which
this case could be — this statutory classification could be
found constitutional.
QUESTION?

Well, how about, the presumption or the

notion, as you call it, that the class you’re interested in
is normally not supported?
MR. BROWHs

There’s a presumption — there's a pre­

sumption that the class that Gregory Norton is in is not
supported? was not previously supported by the deceased father.
QUESTION:

And there is a congressional presumption.

MR. BROWNs

Well, that's — that’s one way the Act

could be read, yes.
QUESTION?

Yes.

Well, let’s assume -that's so.

And you say that there’s conflicting evidence around
MR. BROWN:
QUESTIONs

Okay.

-

Here's an example —

studies? but there’s no question about

what Congress concluded the evidence showed.
MR. BROWNs

If you ascribe that intent to Congress,

and if Congress indicated that finding by the way it structured
the Act.
QUESTION: Well, assume it did.
MR. BROWN2

okay.

Assume it did.

Assume Congress assumed, than,

that these other categories were more likely -QUESTION: Then you're suggesting to us we should
disagree with Congress because we think we have a better notion

32

of what the facts are, or what?
MR, BROWNs

Well, my contention is this:

The only

notion that I can see anyone having would be based upon a few
very limited sources of statistical information.
QUESTION: Well, what about Congress, though?

They’ve

— Congress has come down and made its own judgment in the
s tatute.
MR. BROWN:

Well, assuming that Congress has made that,

judgment -- which I, of course, do not concede —* I think -this
Court still has a role.

If Congress said — if Congress made an

assumption, which is factually incorrect, —
QUESTION:

Well, would our test be that we just

disagree with them, or should we ask:

Is -there some basis,

any basis, in fact for the congressional conclusion?
MR. BROWN:

Well, the Secretary has had a chance to

show you whatever basis Congress might have had.

You have an ---

he's had the chance —- you don’t have to ask him that, he has
had the opportunity to do it.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but you're telling us now
there's quite a bit of basis for the congressional conclusion?
namely, the facts are disputed.

There’s a lot of evidence on

both sides.
MR. BROWN:

No.

There is evidence to indicate that

there can ~ it is really not clear who is more likely to be
supported than not.

There is evidence to indicate that -there is

33

no ground for any assumption.
QUESTION:

Is there evidence to indicate that there is?

MR. BROWN:

Well, here’s one study which was done,

and it's not conclusive, which says that 89 percent of absent
illegitimate fathers

we'll call them that — do not support .

their children? whereas 81 or 82 percent of absent legitimate
fathers don't support their children.
Okay, so there's an eight percent difference between
these two classes, in this one study which was conducted in
California and is referred to in the brief.
My contention is that that eight percent doesn't mean
much.

And that it is really

it is nothing upon which you

can base a conclusion, a presumption such as this, and it's
especially not enough when you're talking about illegitimate
children.
It may be enough when you're talking about Minnesota
farmers, but it's not enough when you're talking about
illegitimate children.

Eight percent is not enough to base a

presumption upon.
QUESTION:

Hr. Brown, would the presumption have been

rebutted in this case if the father had simply written a letter
to the mother, inquiring how their son was?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

That's correct, Your Honor.
A simple letter would have done it?
That would have done it.

34

The problem is that people who are fathers of
illegitimate children don't take to the habit of writing
letters and going through the formalities that a lot of middle
class people traditionally do.

So, as a practical matter, I

wish that happened more often, but it doesn’t happen? and that
makes it more difficult for these people to establish their
right to benefits.
I see no great difference between this case and the
Frontiero case.

That was a case which had the same kind of

presumption with respect to service people, and that man had
to establish -- a male serviceman, it was presumed that his
spouse, his wife, was dependent upon him if he got benefits?
and the opposite was the case for women.

If a woman was a

service person, she had to establish specifically that her
spouse was dependant upon her in order to get fringe benefits
from the service.
It seems to be the very same case in that respect,
and I would request the very same result, which was a reversal
and a finding of unconstitutionality of this statutory scheme.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Brown, you seem to disparage somewhat

the idea that the element of fraud was not present in these
cases, but for a number of centuries — not years? centuries —
the explanation for not allowing illegitimate cnildren to
inherit from a father was the fraud element, was it not?
Isn’t that part of the history of the common law?

35

MR. BROWN:

That's probably correct; and I think

ther eare —
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Probably?

Is there any doubt about it?

I don’t think that's the only reason.

There's another reason which is that historically it was felt
that illegitimate fathers don’t want to give benefits to
bastards.

I think that was probably another historical reason.
There was a presumption, intestate lav/s presume that

illegitimate fathers don't want their illegitimate children
necessarily to get their money.
QUESTION:

Most of the States have had statutes

permitting the recognition of the illegitimate child; and giving
certain rights; and are not the statutes we’re concerned with
patterned on those statutes?
That is, the acknowledgement in writing; for example.
MR. BROWN:

Well; there are three ways — basically;

there are various ways an illegitimate child can become eligible
here:

one is to satisfy his own State's intestacy statute

In maryland. for instance; if Gregory Norton -QUESTION:

That may be — that may be, by having a

written acknowledgment from the father.
MR. BROWN:

Indeed.

And in Maryland; for instance,

all you have to do is openly, have openly acknowledged that
someone is your father.

Gregory Norton, Sr., today, if he had

died after 1970, I think could have established — satisfied

36

that test.
There are many different tests.
impossible to prove paternity.

But it's not

It’s difficult to prove paternity,

but not impossible.
The Secretary, in his own, you know, in the instructions
that he gives to his workers, specifically says;

first, deter­

mine paternity — I guess the facts are utilised when determining
that — and then, secondly, if they happen to fall under this
class, determine whether or not they were supported by or lived
with.
There is the Secretary, who is the one charged with
this duty of establishing paternity, hasn’t indicated, in no
way at all, that indeed the support or residence requirement is
used as another way to bolster proof of paternity.

That may

be a legitimate basis, another setting; but it doesn't seem to
be so here.
I have no further comments.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Jones?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. JONES:

Yes, I would like to make three quick

points, Mr. Chie f Jus tice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
minutes to do it.

You have just three

37

HR. JONES;

Well, I can do it in one minute each.

First, opposing counsel is incorrect in stating that
it is sufficient that the illegitimate child meets the State
intestacy statute.

The correct statutory analysis is set forth

in the Appendix, pages 79 through 83, of the decision of the
district court in the Norton case.
And also that is the long-standing administrative
construction, as we point out in footnote 14 of our Norton brief,
at pages 38 and 39.
Secondly, the purpose of the statutory exclusion
was plainly that of limiting payment of benefits to children
who were dependent.

As we point out on page 34 of our brief,

the Act itself limits benefits to children who were dependent
upon the wage-earner-.

The Senate Report on the amendments

enacting this prevision state — correctly describe the Act as
a national program that is intended to pay benefits to replace
the support lost by a child when his father dies.
And this Court recognised this statutory purpose in
its opinion in Jimenez v. Weinberger, where it pointed out that
‘the primary purpose of -the program is to provide support for
dependents of a wage-earner.
And, third, the validity of the presumptions of
dependency for the categories of children who do not have to
prove dependency are, we think, broadly rational, for the
reasons set forth in pages 38 and 39 of our brief.

38

But J would further point out that if the evidence is
conflicting, if, in some instances, those presumptions may not
be broadly rational, nevertheless, that boils down simply to a
claim that the statute is over-inclusive in its provision of
benefits, not under-inclusive.

And for the reasons I set forth

in my argument, mere over-inclusiveness would not result in the
invalidity of the statute.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:41 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
