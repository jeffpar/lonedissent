? ROC BED ING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

W@ will hear arguments

first this morning in 75-145, th@ Northern Cheyenne Tribe v.
William Hollowhreasfe and others.
Mr. Chestnut, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. CHESTNUT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHESTNUT;

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it pleas© the Courts
I am Steven Chestnut, counsel for petitioner, the
Northern Cheyenne Tribe.

There is one issue before the Court.

That issue arises from the fact that in 1926 Congress enacted a
statute, the Norfcbera Cheyann© Allotment Act, which made limited
allotments of surface land on' the Northern Cheyenne Reservation,
withheld minerals under those allotted surface lands from allot­
ment, and announced a plan to transfer those minerals fifty
years in the future.
In 1968, Congress amended that statutory provision to
withdraw the aspect of the statute which announced tine plan to
make & future transfer of minerals and, instead, left the
oirsraio in the perpetual ownership of the tribe.
The precise issue before this Court is did the 1926
future transfer of minerals endow the
allottees or their hairs or devisees with a vested right to the
consummation of that future transfer.

4
QUESTION:

Of court;®, Mr. Chestnut, a good deal de­

pends upon how you ward the question when yen say that «11 that,
was done in 1926 wee to announce a plan.

You have pretty much

answered the question in your favor, don’t you?
MR. CHESTNUT:

Wall, 1 think that is a fair reading

of —
QUESTION:

But if you ask the question, if you put it.

into terras of what the statute actually said, then, the question
becomes a question, a difficult question, doesn’t it?
MR. CHESTNUT:
QUESTION:

Wall, I think the statute actually —

The statute didn't say we hereby announce

a plan?
MR. CHESTNUT:

No, it didn’t use the word "plan,"

that’s true, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It used the word "become"?

MR. CHESTNUT:

That’s right.

The statute used the

term that the minaral.3 shall become the property cf the allcttese
in fifty years.
QUESTION:

And that shall usually lias some greater

meaning than just an anaounceousat, doesn’t it?
MR. CHESTNUT:

Wall, it can b© taken as a term of in

futuro, and I think that when you take it, with the following

?©nd "b-accm©,K i think it is pretry clear that the intention was
that the property rig-re would coma into existence in fifty ytare.
Moreover

5
QUESTION:

la other words, it has a mandate in it, is

what you are saying?
MR. CHESTNUT:

No, I think it connotes the concept of

futura, of a future event.

And I think, moreover, that the

circumstances giving rise to the Act and the legislative history
of the Act and th© subsequent administrative execution of the
Act is more or less contemporaneous with its enactment# subse­
quent to but contemporaneous.

It clearly shows that the full

undarstabiding of the statuta by the administrators charged with
th© duty of enforcing it and by th© legis .la tors who enacted it
was that no property right was then being created, and I will go
into that in my argument.
I think, moreover, that the facts and circumstances
giving rise to the enactment, mainly the request by th© Northern
Chuyennes themselves,, that they receive an allotment act, clear­
ly shows that the Northern Cheyennes themselves neither desired
nor expected that they qould be acquiring a right, a property
ninerals with the enactment of -that Act.
QUESTION?

Now, I gather Justice' agreed with your posi­

tion, didn't it?
MR. CHESTNUT:
trial court level, t

Nell, th© Justice Department at the
©.strict Court, represented one of the

main respondents in the case, one of the defendant».

MR. CHESTNUT:

QUESTION:

Adverse?

MR. CHESTNUT:

Yes.

through the Ninth Circuit.

That representation continued

Subsequently, Mr. Littlebird, who

was the client of the Justice Department, based on his expert”
ence on the reservation, concluded that it would be in tfc© best
interests of the Northern Cheyennes for tribal ownership of all
the minerals and requested a discontinuance of that representa­
tion, because of that.
QUESTION;

But the Interior Department agreed with

your position?
MR. CHESTNUT:

The Interior Department supports us

entirely and Lislisvss not. only that Congress had the power to
enact the 1960 amendment but, moreover, that its enactment is
vital to the future survival of this Indian tribe and this unique
group of people.
Our position is, of course, that the 1926 statute
created no vested rights in that future distribution, a:,id that
Congress retained inherent continuing power to amend that aspect
of the Allotment Act.
Looking particularly to the four constituent «elements

surrounding this anaciment, one finds I think complete support;
for rur pcs? tic.'i that • -.» property right was transferred at that
time.
circumstances giving rise t© the enacts

7
shows that the federal allotment policy itself commenced more
or 1:..3£ in the 1870's, was formalized in 1887, with the enact­
ment of the general allotment act,and the basic theory was that
the solution to the Indian problem would be to divide up tribal
ownership into individual ownership.

And pursuant to that

policy, individualized allotment acts ware enacted for a host
of res ervations.
The brother reservations of the Northern Cheyenne
Reservation in the State of Montana received allotment act very
early under that policy, the Port Belknap Reservation in 1888,
the Flathead Reservation in 1904, the Crow Reservation in 1904,
the* Blacklist Reservation in 1907, and th© Port Peck jReservati.cn
in 1908.

Yet, by 1926, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was

. yet allotted in an,
statute.
yiv

nse and had received no allotment

The reasons for this arose from two factors?

On®, the

v of rJiQi c/kiirk rdr©i.o:; charged with th® responsibility for

s.d*-'.iiiisti.rin? Indian affairs, ths Secretary of the Infrior,
k. '■ dd© J'■•V.©or© ■■© .

©© 5 p&opl© themselves and th© d-.f i ;•

Cheyenne Reservation physically was not suitable for allotment.
Th© other factor Was that by the early 1920’s, a severe reassert©
raent of the allotment policy was under way, and in fact there
was substantial public and official skepticism about th® utility
of th® allotment policy.
In particular, th® Department of the Interior felt
that th© Nor

people were backward, had a long

3

history of resistance to the white civilization, and were not
suitable for the "civilizing benefits of allotment.M

Moreover,

»

the department felt that the reservation itself was not physic­
ally suitable for allotment because it was a grazing reservation
and the allotment theory was really a farming theory.

So there

was substantial official resistance to alloting tb© Northern
Cheyenne Reservation.
This, coupled with the emergence in the 19209s of the
i

critical reassessment of the allotment policy, made for great
resistance within th© government to allotting th© Northern
Cheyenne Reservation.

In fact, th© 1926 Allotment Act that was

enacted for the Northern Cheyennes was th® last original allot­
ment act ever enacted by Congress.
Moreover, these circumstances gave rise to a uniqua
allotment act, an act far more limited than, any other allotment
act. wh’.ch Congress had ever .enacted.

Th© typical pattern for an

allotment act in all these other Montana reservations, in th©
Osagt-'- Reservation, and throughout the country, was basically a
substantial distribution of the entire corpus of tribal
property.

Provisions were mad© for alienability of distributed

property and, as a result, I might add — and this is ©a© of try
reasons for the official reassessment of th® allotment policy —
ninety million acres cf Indian land were lost from Indian owner *
ship.

And in fact, today, in the State of Montana, if one lc

around, one will find that these allotted reservations are

9
substantially either in white ownership or in white use.

How­

ever, -the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, because of the unique
allotment act, is in 93 percent Indian ownership, is 98 percent
in Indian use, 85 percent of the population of the Northern
Cheyenne Reservation is in Northern Cheyenne, and this is di­
rectly traceable to the unique and limited nature of that
allotment act.
m any event, the Northern Cheyennes wanted — they
ware concerned that their reservation rested only on an execu­
tive order, and that therefore the tribe as a whol® did not have
a vested confirmed property interest in that reservation.

Bo

they wanted a congressional enactment which would confirm tribal
ownership of that executive order reservation. ' Secondly, they
wanted limited allotments so that they can have a plot of land
on which they could build homes.
functions of the allotment act.

Those were the two central
The third function was to make

sure that the natural resources of that reservation remained in
tribal ownership, to be developed to the benefit ©f ail the
people.
The allotment plan itself, the allotment statute, an­
nounced what I maintain is a. plan, a statutory plan to -transfer
the mineral interest under allotted lands at the end of fifty
years on th© theory that th® fifty-year period would be adequate
for development of that mineral resource.
sause of

It turned out, be-

the mineral wealth of the .

10
reservation was not developable within that fifty-year period,
and in 196S Congress sr©r.dsd the act to implement the conferal
intent of the 1926 Congress that the mineal wealth of the reser­
vation inure to the benefit of all the people.
In any event, in February of 1925, the people them­
selves submitted a petition to Congress requesting the enactment
of the allotment act*

Th© petition was submitted to their

Senator, Senator Thomas Walsh.

And the petition is very short.

It is at page 56 of the appendix.

It was signed by 490 members

of the tribe, which, according to my conservative calculation,
was 59 percent cf the adult membership of th© -crib© at that time.
Th© cover letter that submitted this petition indicated that
them was absolutely no opposition that had been indicated on
the reservation to the concept of this petition.

And the peti­

tion is very•short, three paragraphs•
Th?. first paragraph says that the people want an
tillable farmland.

The second paragraph,'which is

crucial tv. if ■: resolution of this, case, says that these people
want th© following:

"To reserve all mineral, timber, and coal

lands for the benefit of th© Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe,
said tribe to have absolute control of same."

That event in

ji-t-i; petition is what kicked off the legislative process for fe.e
formulation ©f an set which I submit, petitioner submits, con­
forms to .th© expressed desires and expectations of the people
on tha r@sferv3.tioo..

II
QUESTION?

hr. Chestnut# if you were representing th©

other side and wanted to be aura that they had a vested inter­
ent, would you nave drawn th© statute any differently?
MR. CHESTMrT:

I didn’t hear the last part of your

question, I'm sorry.
QUESTIONS

Would you have drawn the statute any dif­

ferently?
MR. CHESTNUT;

Well, I think that what Congress did

in th© statute was in two places an unprecedented fashion, make
very broad reservations of power over the entire allotment pla.i
in th© statute.
■

Oth®r allotment acts, like idle Crow Allotment
:b.i--.-

1 .■

•

;

"; t'■

Allotment Act, which basically were massive assaults on th®
tribal system, had very specific reservations- of power.

And I

think the question may ts directed to an argument advanced by
respondents'1 that the -Northern Cheyenne didn’t have a specific
reservation of power..

The Northern Cheyenne had an overall, all

encompassing reservation of power, which I submit was in complete
conformity with iC.v.^ o mitral intsnt of Congress, which was that
we are not relinquishing trust responsibility, we are not taking

part, of this reservation apart, we ar® maintaining the federal
control, and we are doing a very limited thing.
Now, with hindsight, it might have been good bo enumer­

ate ©very aspect of federal control that was being retained but,
on trm other hand, I think those things ar© hard to do.

12
QUESTION:

Well, I guess I don't get. an answer to my

question.
MR. CHESTNUT:
sponsive:

Well, I think perhaps this will to® re­

I think that, as a matter of law, the Congress - of the

Unit-ad States did not have to reserve any particular power to
alter executory unconsumxnatecl aspects of that statute.

It is 5.

matter of law, and I think Congress was operating in 1926 on
tho basis of a body of decisions of this Court, interpreting
allotment legislation, which established that Congress has an
inherent authority to alter allotment distributions.

In fact,

in the legislative history of the Crow Allotment Act, in a
supplement to the Crow Allotment Act, the 1920 provision, there
was debates on the- floor of Congress about vrhether or not it wa.:
necessary for Cov.grcsss to specifically reserva a povrr to extend
the period of a mia@ri.ls reservation, and the statement on the
floor of Congress s in connection with that precis© question was
it is not necessary, w© have inherent authority to do that, and
I think that is completely supported by the cases.
QUESTION:

Now, somewhere along th© line, will you

comment on your opposition's argument about state tax results?
MR. CHESTNUT:
re p eteria srgu-■' that toy

Y@s, I will do that right now.

Th©

or perpetuating tha ire

•f minerals, the mineral estate in the tribe is than,

zstm@nt of tribal property in

13
favor ©f the state.

Th@r@ are a number of answers to that which

I have sat forth in tha reply brief, but I will try to recall
the basic ones.
NurabSiT oiia, that is really not the issue?, in this cases,
Th© issue in this case is did respondents have a vested property
right, which Congress could not. take away.

Respondents, by this

argument, triad to bootstrap themselves basically into the
standing of th© tribe and say that the tribe is losing some
kind of vested property right.
issues in this case.

Really, it is outside the

It is an inappropriate argument.

And the

basic question here is did th© 1968 amendment talc© away same
vested property right of respondents.
Secondly, th© tax statute, which is 25 U.S.C., sac *.i
398(c), which respondents argue would subject this tribal
■cata taxation, is in fact not applicable to th
Indian reservation.

That statute is applicable purely to

executive order reservations and, under a decision of this
Court — the British-American case, which 1 believe was decided
in j.939

a.t was ns id that an Indian reservation which was

?&b initially -on executive order and subsequently received
congressional confirmation by statute, is not an oxscut.lv©
rorarvafion within the meaning of that tax statute.
the argument of respondents is really
i; - .a;.;antly circular.

If they are contending that the tar

1 b Cc} , sucieous rae arabat mineral ©state to 'csrahicn

14
during this perpetuated ownership period, and that that was a
taking, than certainly that statute was a taking when it was
enacted in 1927.

That tax statute was enacted in 1927, after

tribal title An the entire reservation was confirmed by Congress
The tribe as a whole had a vested property right at that point.
Therefore, if the statute, by taxing tribal lands, is a taking,
it was a taking at that point and on that theory is not applic­
able, either.
Moreover, the Northern Cheyenne Act itself, the allot­
ment act, specifically, provides that leasing of tribal minerals
will b: conducted under the 19-38 statute.

This was incorporated

in the subsequent amendment, and then that, w® submit, makes
this 1927 statute inapplicable.
Then ars otior arguments which I won't go through, but
we have made thorn all in our reply brief.
The petition of the N6rth©rn Cheyenne people was sub­
mitted in 1924 and the legislative process, we submit, conformed

v ::w

.. p* . .

The Department of the .Interior begrudgingly responded with an
-flll :at bill which was very limited, as I have indicated,

a:;:i g

ly limitari, “pa :.ifinally reservedminerals from allotmanb

and specifically allotted only surface lands for agricultural
and farming purposes.
And finally, upon enactment in the House of Represents
•Jvas of thn final for»'. of the Act, fchs House sponsor of tha

15
bill, Representative Leavitt, indicated that the Act, the purpose of the Act was to make allotments so that the individual
Northern Cheyennes could "have permanent hones and develop their
own farms."

Moreover, he indicated that the Act "offers a

means for the development of any mineral resources such as oil
which may be discovered on the reservation for the benefit of
fch© tribe.”

lastly, ha indicated that the Act "gives the

Indians the fullest possible benefit of their natural resources.
The fifty-year provision was a provision — there is
no explicit mention of the genesis of that fifty-year provision
in the legislative record, but I think the fair reading of the
entire legislative history is that the purpose of that provision
was to ultimately unify title after the mineral reserve was de­
veloped .
Finally —
QUESTION;

What did the most recent Act do?

It did

more than just extent the term, didn't it?
MR. CHESTNUT:

The. 1958 Act, which was the amendment

at issue in this case, extended tribal ownership in perpetuity.
It eliminated other provisions *—
QUESTION:

Well, then,

any possibility that the

•ill*: t-'-'-'- would &v'sr hav-s a unified ownership is eliminated by*
that?
MR, CEESTu'Jlh

That is correct, and this was based *—

tha initial version of the Act, in fact —

16
QUESTIONS

This goes farther than just insuring that

this minercil interest will be utilized for the benefit of the
tribe?
MR. CHESTNUT;
QUESTION:

Well —

Because if the mineral interest were fully

developed for the next twenty-five years, the tribe would still
own the mineral interests?
MR. CHESTNU:

That is correct.

Now, the reason that

it was made a perpetual extension was because the Department of
the Interior pointed out to Congress that the essential purpose
of this amendment was to fulfill the 1926 intent, which provides
for full development of the mineral wealth to the benefit of the
tribe.

As a result, they indicated that the intent of Congress;

was not to transfer anything of substantial value to the
allottees;.

It point out, moreover, that after a full develop­

ment period, were, allowed, by that point in. time the heirship
situation on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, which is already
somewhat complicated

20 percent or 17 percent of the

respondent class is neither Northern Cheyenne and in same cases
not Indian — that if the reservation ware extended for an
additional finite period of time, fifty years or a hundred
years, the heirship situation would b® impossible in view of the
fact, teat nothing of value was intended to be transferred at
that point, there was really no utility in imposing upon the
Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs the

17
tremendous problem of sorting out the heirship difficulties.
So that was the genesis of th© perpetual extension.
In short —
QUESTION;

Do you think Congress would have the power

to change it back now?

Suppose you prevail in this case, could

Congress next year change it back?
MR. CHESTNUT:

Absolutely, yes.

It would be tribal

property and the Congress has complete authority to provide for
distribution of tribal property to tribal members under its
plenary authority.
Finally, I would like to point to th© administrative
interpretation of th© meaning of this Act.

Immediately after

its enactment, th© allotments ware consummated after 192S, be­
tween 1926 and 1934, by the issuance of allotment patents.
The?v patents mads a- blanket reservation of all minerals and
natural resources for the benefit of th© tribe.

It container

no mention of the fifty-year transfer, ho covenant to make a
fifty-year transfer.

In short, there was no basis from the

document itself for th© Northern Cheyennes to believe — and
in fret, fhay ciid;:rt b©Have, expact or hops for that tbry would
be acquiring a property interest in these minerals.
Thus# as a result of the enactment of the 1925 Act
od th© issuance of -feh© patents, what did th© allottees have is
oh© way of an indicia of property in this mineral resource?
Plainly and simply, all they had was a statute which announced a

18
plan to in the future create a property interest.

They had no

power to transfer that future interest, whatever it may be,
they had no power to profit from it directly by their own
transactions, no power to do anything with respect to that
future provision in the statute.
Moreover, they had no physical control, they had no
power of enjoyment.

The 1926 Act lodged leasing authority over

the entire mineral resource in the tribal council and provided
that all proceeds of mineral development on the reservation
would inure to the benefit of the Northern Cheyenne people as a
whole, would be deposited in the United States Treasury and
would be expended for the benefit of the Northern Cheyennes as
Congress might deem expedient.
Lastly, this future interest that these allottees,
this expectancy that these allottees had after 1926 was subj-set
to the tribe's complete power to exhaust that reserve.

And,

moreover, to the statutory provision which said that the pro­
ceed,;-' of such development of that reserve would inure, to the
benefit of the tribe.

So, it is not possible to identify any

conventional index of property arising from either the 1926 Act
or th® allotments patents issued subsequently.
Moving new to tba strict legal question of what ths
state of the law is with regard to the power of Congress to
alter executory unconsummated portions of statutory plans for
the distribution of tribal property to tribal members, the

19
decisions of this Court.- starting most prominently in 1912 with
the decision in Gritts v. Fisher, and then a whole string of
decisions up to. the recent decision of United States v. Jim in
1972 consistently and nniformally reaffirm that a statutory
plan which contemplates a future distribution is amendable,
alterable, repeal&bl® by Congress in light of changing condi­
tions and the best interests of th© Indians.

That power in

those cases is founded on this Court’s perception that it is
crucial to Congress’ historic and constitutional function to
serve Indians and Indian property, that Congress maintain
authority over the tribal property of tribal Indians, and
furthermore tl

xat authority is essential to th© implementa­

tion of federal policy»

It is founded on the notion, a legal

notion, that no right, no individual right in tribal property
arises until the tribal property is actually distribute!.
QUESTION:

Of course, Congress could in th© '58 Act,

it simply said that we are giving the reserve mineral rights to
the trii:r and if it is a taking, the allottees can sum in the
Court of Claims or sue in the District Court.

I take it that

Congress would have had that part — the fact that they provided
that the 568 Act would be void if interest had actually vested,
suggests that Congress was perhaps more concerned in that case
than it might have been in others as to whether there had been
a vesting.
MR. CHESTNUT:

Well, I think that is a point which the

20

Ninth Circuit seized upon and which respondents argued, that
Congress 9 formulation of the 1968 amendment indicates some un­
certainty on the part of Congress.

I think that, first of all,

that particular uncertainty at that point doesn’t completely
mesh with Congress * prior view of this statute, this legisla­
tive statute.
In 1961, Congress amended this allotment act to make
"

allottees.

■. ■■■-■■ :r • r

...

First of all, it provided that th© tribe could enter

into minerals leases which would extend indefinitely,

in effect,

it took away the right ~ assuming there was a right — in these
allottees to -themaelves to transact independ® 1 ty of th© tribe
with respect to this future interest.
Secondly, the statute added th© term "devisees* to the
class of future beneficiaries of this mineral right.

It provided

— the original act provided that the future interest would b©
transferred to th© allottees or their heirs.

In 1961,- Congress

In 1961,. th^ref

in th® case of an original allottee who had died prior to 1961,
and as to who there had been ascertained an existing heir, those
heirs, by that 1961 amendment were supplanted by the devisees?
*

my point being that —
QUESTION?

Isn’t that retroactive- application. 11, t. ?

MR. CHESTNUT s

Absolutely.

Moreover, the 1961 statute

specifically said that any prior transfers of that f

21
by tli® allottees or their heirs was null and void, and that any
future transfers within the remainder of the fifty-year period
would be null and void.

My point is that the conservatism in
*

1968 was not evident in 1961, and 1 think the basic reason for
the conservatism was a concern, an awareness that this mineral
reserve was quite valuable and a concern that the United States
not in fact be subjected to these kinds of claims of damages
which you have referred to, Mr. Justice.

I -think it. was a con­

cern to absolutely eliminate any possibility that the United
States would be liable and damages.

And I think that

the legislative history indicates that Congress felt it had the
power to do it, but out of what I would consider excessive and
inconsistent concern, it incorporated this very unusual pro­
vision.
Finally, I would like to make the point that this exarcisa in 1968 of Congress* inherent power to amend this statu­
tory provision was — in fact the facts involved here, was en­
tirely — it proves the premia© on which it is based, which is
that Congress needs that power.

In light of those circumstances, Congress amended the

I think this proves the fundamental soundness of chat we

QUESTION:

Mr. Chestnut, you gave us the specific

legislative history of the 1926 Act and pointed out the peti­
tion beginning on pag«> 56 of the appendix addressed to Senator
Walsh and tha later reluctance and somewhat grudging agreement
of the BIA and the Interior Department to the allotment, the
last allotment made in 1926.

What is the specific history of

the 1963 legislation?
MR. CHESTNUT:

The specific history of the 1968 legis­

lation is, as I have indicated, that Congress became aware that
suddenly this coal rrayrv'a was for the first time commercially
developable, that the tribe was going to lose control of it in
a short eight years, that there would•be a situation of
additional wealth on the reservation as a. result, you would
have people remaining in intense poverty and people suddenly
becoming rich — I think it is not explicit in the legislative
history, the- point I am going to make now, but I think —

24
QUESTION:

But that was ray question.

MR. CHESTNUT:

— but I think — no, that is explicit,

what. I have just stated is explicit.
QUESTION:

And this was brought to ’the attention of

Congress by the tribe?
MR. CHESTNUT:

This was brought to the attention of

Congress by the tribe and the legislative history indicates
that Congress wanted to spread the benefits of any mineral de­
velopment equally among all members of the tribe.
QUESTION:

Of course, by this time, our whole national

policy had changed vis-a-vis the Indians, had it not?

For many

years, beginning in the 1880's, I guess, and up through 1926
and 1930, the whole thrust had been to break up the tribes, to
turn Indians into the equivalent of whit© farmers, and then
baginning in about 1930 there was a 180-degree change and the
whole thrust was to preserve 1*3 tribes and not try to integrate
Indians into white society.
MR. CHESTNUT:
QUESTION:

Isn't that about right?

That is —

And this 1968 legislation r elf scted the-

then current philosophy as the bast way to treat with th©
Indians, i.e., by preserving

their tribes or tribal ownership;

their tribal organisation, their tribal governments, and their
•tribal property, in stork contract with what had been the
policy of the United States for soma fifty years, baginn&xig in
the 1880’s.

Is that right?

25
MR. CHESTNUT;

Well, not completely.

I don't think

it is accurata —
QUESTION:

I don’t mean if it is right, I didn’t mean

isthat right, is that correct.

Wa won’t argue which is right

and which is wrong.
MR. CHESTNUT;

Well, it is not completely correct,

in reference to the Northern Cheyenne Act of 1926, which was,
I think, not a product, of what had previously been the view
that tribal ownership should be distributed.

As we pointed out.,

I think

QUESTION*

It was the last vesfcage of it.

The policy

was changing then?
MR. CHESTNUT s'

Absolutely, and in fact it was the

a of it, and the Act itself bears 'the earmarks of the

fact that this was, far different —

Correct, and a much more limited allotment

and a much rut-res drudging on® on the part of the Interior Depart­
ment?

#
MR. CHESTNUT;

QUESTION:

Except the one phrase that is absent is the

one that your brothers on the other side emphasize» and all of
these other cases and in most of these other similar phraseology .
thar© is always that reservation "unless otherwise provided by
act of Congress s,” and that is absent here?
MR. CHESTNUT:

Wall,, I would like to comment on that,

if I may.
QUESTION:

That is really the key to their argument.

MR. CHESTNUT:

Wall, I have looked very carefully at

the legislative history of the genesis of those phrases in other
acts, in particular the Osage act, as a phrase.

On® will find

— and this is do tailed in the reply brief — on© will find t* .ft
that provisio was alternatively included and left out of th©
•Osage act.

The Osage act was enacted in 1906.

of the sort you. are tv-.inking.

It had a proviso

I think a fair reading of tha

statute shows that the, proviso only applied to a portion, i:/
fact, of the coal reserve.

In any event, Congress subsequently

extended that coal ownership in 1921 to a date certain, without
reserving any further power to extend it further,

Naver tl r

.

in 1929, Congress came along and extended it to yet another trie
certain and this time reintroduced th© proviso that it was in­
corporating reserva power.

In the Crow act, there was specific

statement on the floor of the House in reference to this pr-viso,
but it was not necessary to preserve what 'was really Congress’

27
inherent power, aM I think the history of the formulation of
the Crow act shows that the proviso was not for the purpose of
preserving an inherent power but arose from a disagreement be­
tween the House and the Senate over whether twenty-five years
or fifty years was the right initial pariod.

It arose from a

compromise not over a generic inherent, power of Congress but
over whether or not the initial period should be twenty-five
years or fifty y©ars.
I think that those provisions on their face may ba
impressive, but when you go behind them, when you take a look at
the actual legislative, history which gave rise to their crea­
tion,, and when you take a look at th© basic act that they arise
in and compare it to the .basic act of th© Northern Cheyenne
Reservation, you can give no real credence to that provision»
It is ludicrous, frankly, to think that Congress intended to
relinquish -trust responsibility in its enactment of the Northern
Cheyenne Allotment Act which it did not relinquish in taking
apart tUase other reservations, really.
QUESTION:

You would be in a much more comfortable

position, however, web

you, if that language were in this

1526 act, 'imless' otherwise provided by act of Congress’*?
MR. CHESTNUT:

I think the respondents wouldn't have

th© argument that they seam to rely so heavily on, but I emphasize that I think it is not a sound argument*
MR. chief JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall.

Mr. Bunch.

OPAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN L„ BUNCH, ESQ* ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS WILLIAMSON AND BOWEN
MR. BUNCHi

Mr* Chief Justice, and nay it please th®

Court:
The issue as stated in this case is whether the 1926
Allotment Act conferred a vested remainder type interest in th©
allottees and their heirs.

If the ’26 act did create such an

interest, then of coarse the 568 amendment is unconstitutional
as a dives tenant of that interest without compensating for it.
QUESTION:

Well, 'the *68 amendment isn’t unconstitu­

tional because by its vary terms it is inoperative, is it not,
if th® Court should decide that there was a property interest
created in 1926?
MR. BUNCH;

Right.

K«ll, the way that clause is

MR. BUNCH:

Then it would be null and void?
Right.
Well, also, if Congress proceeded to simply

As I understand

the law, they era5h ssy that the act would have no effect.
MR. BUNCHi

Right, and that is why the section 2, I
there, which specifically .

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BUNCH;

And wa submit that since Congress was so

concerned that they specifically mandated this lawsuit to make
sure that they war© going to get stuck with this judgment; in­
dicates that they were pretty concerned that they were stepping
beyond their lawful powers in passing the '68 amendment,, and I
feel that should be taken into consideration, in viewing Congress'
intent in passing the '68 amendment.
QUESTION;

You think that intent is of greater weight

than the intent in 1961?

They make quite a point of the fact

that the 1961 statute is equally inconsistent with your — is
inconsistent with your interpretation of the 1926 act.

Should

wo consider that that evidence —
MR. BUNCH:

That is not before the Court.

It is not

at issue in this case.
QUESTION:

But do you think it is relevant evideaeu ef

congregional intent in 1326 and, if not, why is the intcut in
1968 any different?
MR. BUNCH;

The '61 amendment did not divest the

allottees of their interests.

That did tha '61 amendment do?

It had to

to grant leases of duration greater than fifty

MR. BUNCH;
QUESTION:

Right.
Now, is that consistent with the ownership

in the allottees after that period?
MR. BUNCH;

Not if they were to give the allottees

their royalties, I presume, once their estate became possessory.
I assume they would be analogous to remain for the life of the
estate, for a period of years, and one© the remainder ©f a man's
interest is attached that they would have to get the royalties
from the development.
CUE ST I ON:

Perhaps

m<

should put it this way:

Do you

construe the S61 act as consistent with your interpretation of
the 526 act?
MR. BUNCHs

Right, but th&re are constitutional prob­

lems under the '61 act in broadening the class of people who are
\

eligible.

It included, I believe, devisees —

MR. BUNCH:
QUESTION;
MR. BURCH;

Devisees as wall as allottees.
— as well as allottees.
Yes.
liid to -that extent, there are constitution­

al problems with the '61 act.
QUF3TICH:

I tuv. juct

ths thrust cf fry qu^rcior-

isn't to get into a' debate about the ’61 act, but. I am just

31
wondering the extent to which it is appropriate to look at
either the *61 act cr the *68 act when we are trying to identify
the congressional intent in 1926.
MR, BUNCH;

Well, 1 am not really that familiar with

the history of the *61 amendment.

However, the *68 amendment

was of considerable concern with the prospect of div@sti.ng
these interests.

I don’t know whether that concern was there

in the problem of broadening the beneficiarias in the 361 act
or not, so I really can't comment on the congressional intent
in the *61 amendment.
QUESTION;
what Congress did
MR. BUNCH;

At any rata, the inquiry in this case is
tidh't do in 1926, isn't it?
Right.

Right.

That is what they in­

tended, 'that shall become property, in section 3 of the allot­
ment act.
W© feel that, this did create a vested remainder type

interest for savara1 reasons.

First of all is the legislative •

niatory of the 3 26 act ,: which I have outlined in pages 33
through 35 of our brief,.

And this legislative history indicates

teat Congress knowingly intended to currently vest the remainder
interest in the allottees and their hairs.

Our construction of

"his language is that it permitted a currently vested but de­
layed p?.c:£o:vC3ion of 11: s sdneral estate.
cause most of

We 'feel this is b-i w

Lonal consideration of this bill took

piae;::, is ths Es&sts Committee on Indian Affairs, aad they

32
substantially rewrote th& bill.

And re foci toot if you look

at the language of the; bill as it went'into this committee and
as it emerged from the committee, you can gat an idea of what
Congress was trying to do with this bill.
As the allotment, of the minerals went into this com­
mittee, it provided that they would allot "only the surface."
Mow, this "only the surface" language could be intended as a
congressional intent that they intended to allot only the sur­
face presently and that they intended to delay allotting the
minerals, they intended to delay any vesting of the minerals.
However, the committes specifically rejected that language and
they gave this remainder.-;type interest to the allottees in un­
equivocal terms.

There ware no contingencies apart from the

passage of the fifty-year term, and that is not really a contiaguncy c.a such, au I -Understand.

At. any rata, they rejected

language which would be fairly strong, in favor of the petitionsue;

that and gave the allottees thai

interest in unequivocal terms.

'

Also 1 would point cut -that the grant to the a Hottest
her

As was mentioned earlier,1 the language says

"shall become," and this has been interpreted to be mandatory
language and was not leaving the grant to the discretion of
Congress.

And I

• that the term "shall," being in tLa

future tense tana, refers to the "shall" of the possession being
future tens®, not fcli© vesting being future tens©.

33
Also, it. is interesting to compare the Northern
Cheyenne Allotment Act with other allotment acts.

As was men­

tioned earlier, when Congress chose to reserve the power to
extend tribal ownership, they specifically did so, they express­
ly included provisions in the grant of the minerals.

It said

the minerals Trill be held by the tribe for "X" number of years
and then passed to the allottees, but they always included the
all important proviso "unless otherwise provided by Congress."
They did this for the Crow Reservation, the Port Belknap
Reservation, the Blackfeec Reservation, the Osage Reservation,
the Standing Rock Reservation, the Cheyenne River — the
Standing Rock and Cheyenne River as one reservation — the
Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Reservation..

And all of these

allotment acts were passed prior to the 8 26 allotment act hare
at issue, thus "otherwise provided by Congress" had become a
0

standard form proviso whenever Interior or whoever was drafting
those bills wantid to - reserve this power, they just included
this clause in the. statuis.

However, they didn't do it in this

instance, and we submit that this indicates a congressional wish
not to reserve this power and not to delay the ordinary vestii;*
process.
According to the ordinary vesting process in allotment
acts, the allottee's rights and interest in that allotment vest
when he files his allotment application in the normal Bureau of
Indian Affa r

:fie£.

And sine® the remainder intere

34
mineral estate was allotted as of that time, the rights of the
allottee to his remainder interest in the. mineral ©state vested
when he filed his application in the local BXA office in Lame
Dear or Crow agency or whereve he filed.
The timing of the vesting is, according to this
Court’s decisions in Arenas v. U.S„, Raymond Bear Hill, and
allotment rights in Port Belknap in San Juan County.

Also in

the petitioner’s reply brief, they bring up the point that many
of our authorities regarding the allottees vesting of rights
have to do with overriding executive discretion and not congres­
sional statutes.

However, there ar© several of these decisions-

which do override later congressional statutes which attempt to
abrogat® the allotment rights.
For instance, the allotment rights in the Fort Belknap
decision was a Department of the Interior decision in which the
Indian allottee hud filed his application for allotment.

The

trust allotment had not been issued, and the Wheeler-Howard
Act took effect.

The Wheeler-Howard Act said no more allotment

— vc. will have no more allotment of tribal land, therefore
this was a congressional statute which said there would be no
more allotments issued.

However, .the Department of the Interior

•‘..aid lie had filed his application prior to that time, so, despite,
this provision of the Wheeler -Howard Act, w@ ar® going to issue-this trust patent anyway.
Also, Raymond Bear Hill was this factually similar

35
situation

in which ha had filed, his allotment application.

Thera waa an amendment practically identical to the one here at
issus which said the tribe gets the minerals, and the Department
of the Interior said, well, he filed his application before this
act took effect, reserving the minerals to the tribe, therefore
they would issue the trust patent giving th© minerals to
Raymond Bear Hill.
Also the allotment rights in San Juan County is very
similar.

Also th© petitioner claims that there ar© broad reser­

vations of power in the 1926 allotment act.

It may ba helpful,

Ik viewing these in context — the act is set out in its entirety
at the beginning of the appendix — to examine the sections, ar
I mention each section and discuss each section.
Th® first reservation of power, a very broad reserva­
tion of power •— oh, I would also like to mention that on the
rmal period of vesting, that the vesting on the Northern
Ch•.yt-ane Reservation would have had to have taken place by 1934,,
between 1926 and 1934, because the Nheeler-Howard Act in June

of '3 4 did terminate 'the allotment rights, where we have no ©x~

MR . BUNCHs

Right.

At any rate, the first reservation of power the peti­
tioner claims allows the — oh, before 1 mention this, I would
also like to emphasize that a specific reservation of power here
is necessary, as indicated by the fact that Interior thought it
was necessary to include this "unless provided by Congress" pro­
vided in all the othsr statutes.

If it wasn’t necessary, it

would be mere surplusage, and the fact that Interior came time
and time again and included it would indicate that it was
necessary.
QUESTION:

What kind of patents were issued to the

allottee?
MR. BUNCHs

MR. BUNCHs

indicate that -that is not a property right as such, but that is

Tiger v. Western Investment

is the lead case on that, and —
QUESTION:

Well, now, what is the difference between

that and this mineral interest?
MR. BUNCHs

Well, Choate v. Trapp is the case that we

have relied on extensively, and in that case the trust allot­
ments were issued with a twenty-five year tax exemption, however,
prior to the expiration of the tax exemption, Congress passed a
statute repealing the federal tax exemption.

In that case, this

Court said tha tax exemption is a property right and Congress
cannot divest that property right in a trust allotment by subse­
quent legislation.

And in that discussion, they specifically

reconciled Tiger v. -Western Investment.

They said Tiger is a

different cars, it docs not. deal with property rights.

The

restraint on ?.lioaatioa was included because many of these
Indians were- just fresh in from their tribal existence, they
erf no concapt of tty whits man's days of doing business in
severing minerals from estates, surface estates and all that
• .S’
h

of v;lieand so they put this restraint on alienation i.n
in order to ke®p tnem from being taken advantage of, also

in hopes that they would settle down during that twenty-five
yar parted and become farmers.

But this whole approach to

this restraint on alienation in a 'long line of these cases
which I have cited is thai

restraint on alienation is simply

39
not. considered a property right, but it is an attributa of
wardship, it is a personal status.
QUESTION?
MR. BUNCH:

The restraint still remains?
On same of the land, it does.

They can

apply for the fee patent to get the fee patent issued, but much
of the land is still trust.
QUESTION:
MR. BUNCH:

But the Choate case was a contract case?
No, that is on© place we disagree.

As I

mentioned — as a matter of fact
QUESTION:
MR. BUNCH:
QUESTION:
MR. BUNCH:

That is what the petitioner said.
Well, I wrote up quite a section
I know.
and it quotes a number of authorities

which disagree with that, including Felix Cohen and this Court
and a number of its decisions.

As a matter of fact, there is a

statement in Choate which specifically disagrees with that.
QUESTION:

Wall, I just, wanted to bs sure you didn't

agree.
MR. BUNCH:

All right.

On the top of page 23, the

Atoka agreement was a contract, and tha Court specifically says
the question here isn't whether they are parties to toe contract
tout whether they have rights under the statute.
‘

There have

:a numerous cases of this Court that have also held that
.

case.

cory right

and property right is not a contract right

40
But, at any rate, the section 1 language that is
subject to the management and control of Congress, we submit,
is simply a statement ~™ this was the initial recognition by
Congress of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, thus we submit
that this should be interpreted that Congress is saying w®
recognize the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, it is a legitimate
reservation, and w© are going to assume our normal guardianship
duties on this reservation.

And it is a statement of normal

guardianship duties, is what this management and control
language means in section 1.
Also, I would remind you that this is an allotment
act, and the vary purpose of an allotment act is to vest indi­
vidual rights in real proparty and individual Indians.

And if

you take the opening proviso of this management and control
language, the opening proviso of the allotment act, which it
is not specifically to minerals, it could b© — it is a power to
abrogate otherwise vested rights -- it could be used to divest
any right on that reservation.

So you would have Congress in a

curious position of beginning an allotment act with the provls o
which would destroy the very purpose of the act.

And I submit

that you should not impute such a schizo legislative design on
Congress without more convincing evidence which this statute
does not prevent.
There is also a management and control language listed
in section 3, which is right, at the very end of section 3.

41
Howevor , I would. submit, fee the Court that this does not reach
fcha allotment minerals here at issue.

The only minerals here at

issue are the minerals underlying the allotment land, not under­
lying the tribal land.

The quote in section 3 says that the

management and control is limited to unallotted lands or tribal
land.

And since the remainder interest in the tribal estate

was allotted, it is not subject to that section 3 management
and control language.

This was the Ninth Circuit’s opinion and

conclusion on this matter, and I submit it should be affirmed.
Thank you.

Yes, sir.

1868 treaty, the Indians ware promised a choice of three places.

QUESTIONS

Where does Tongue River get in here?

MR. BRUEGGEMANN;

The Tongue River is on the Cheyeim©

Reservation, Your Hosier, presently, and I believe it was also
mentioned there.
But the fact remains that this was the original govern­
mental intent to vest the Indians, the individual Indians with
tracts of lard 1b th© amount of 320 acres.

Then, in 1926, cam©

Finally, the government

said, by ex©cut!v© order, President Chester A. Arthur, gave
thus a reservation.

This was enlarged by President McKinley in

1900.
Finally, in 1926, cam© th® allotment act, and now
Congress said, well, w© are not going to give you 320, but I
vill tali yet what wa will do, w© will give you 180 acres, and
itvjy did so '.radsr that act.

It is th© respondent's position

that they were, entitled to 320, but in the avent that th© treaty

had no significance whatsoever — and that is what petitioner
allegas — h® wants this Court to ignore completely the 1868
rrrr.t.y, which was the first time the northern Cheyenne had
nded any lamer to the United States of America, and here they
load down their arms ord cclaci over 51,210,000 acres in return

45
for these proraises which were naver kept.

This is shocking,

gentlemen.
The; 1926 act at least gave them half of what they
promised.

Now, the tribe says, the tribal corporation, with 62

percent of the minerals, says, well, we still don't have
enough.

So the United States of America enacts the 1968 amend­

ment to the 1926 act and says, no/ we give you the minerals not
for fifty years but in perpetuity, that should certainly give
you enough time to remove all the minerals.

QUESTION:

Only 38 percent of the surface was ever

allotted, is that right?
MR. BRUEGGEMANNs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that's correct.

Is that your representation?

MR. BRUEGGEMMIN:

Yes, sir.

There are certain rules

of construction I think this Court would concede that are applic­
able to both treaties, statutes and executive orders, and one of
those is that they must ba construed in pari materia, in other
words, the Court must consider all these •tilings, the treaty,
the statute, the executive orders, because they all involve the
same subject matter.

And it is certainly the individual and not

the tribal corporation that ia in most need of the protection of
this Court.
In

.y contract, it is the words of the contract it­

self that govern and not what may have preceded or what might
hav;, baon, as pstitioaar would have this Court believe.

policy of the Congress at that time had been the same, especially
I'wrw tli© Chwyesuis were concerned, from the treaty of 1860 until

allottee an undisputable fee title estate.
*

The 1926 act, disputing th© ignoring the treaty, as
petitioner would have this Court do, says that the tribe is to

4?
have the minerals for fifty years,

well,

the tribe sat on their

rights for fifty years and did nothing and did not develop these
minerals.

And it says at the end of fifty years, the minerals

shall become the property of the allottee, heir and devisee.

It is this year.

He has been waiting

H® wants it now.
There was no qualifying phrase, as there were in five

other allotment acts that all preceded the Northern Cheyenne
Allotment Act, starting in 1902 or 606, all the way up until
the 1926 act, five prior acts.

And petitioner would have this

Court believe that the Congress just dropped the phrase, he
just forgot, or h® added it some place ©Is©, when ha makes
reference to not allotted lands but unallotted lands, tribal
lands.

Yes, the United 'States retains plenary power over tribal

lands, but he didn’t say that about allotted lands, and her© I
