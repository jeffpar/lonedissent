MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Harrison will open

with 5257, Gregg against Georgia.
Mr. Harrison, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. IIUGHEL HARRISON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HARRISON;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I am Hughel Harrison from Lawrenceville, Georgia,

and I represent Troy Leon Gregg, who is now under two death
sentences for murder.

Originally he was tried on two murder

charges plus two armed robbery cases.

The Georgia Supreme

Court on its review of the cas© set aside the death penalty
as to armed robbery on two grounds:

That the armed robberies

haci been used as an aggravating circumstance on the murder
cases and that ‘the death penalty was disproportionate for the
punishment of this crime.
Gregg was not tried under a 1973 law in Georgia with
some changes in our death penalty.

It is interesting to note

that only on© offensa, and that of perjury, was deleted.

The

General Assembly provided for a bifurcated trial under which
at the first phase you would determine guilt or innocence and
that only.

Then that same jury was to consider the punishment

that would be imposed.
We submit that in this area we still have some of
the? arbitrariness and the discretion and that wa do not meet

4
the Furman standard.
In the 1973 law there were 10 enumerated statutory
aggravating circumstances.

Those ar© set out, and I believe

they are set out in the brief for the respondent in that the
appendix was not printed on the appellant’s or petitioner's
brief.

Those are specified and referred to as the statutory

aggravating circumstances»
At -tliis phase of the trial, tha trial judge must
determine which, of those ha will submit and in addition th©
jury, as I understand the law, can consider other aggravating
circumstances, to use the language "as authorized by law.”
Nowhere does th© statute make anv definition of a mitigating
circumstance.

It is completely silent.

Nov/, in this cas® when we proceed with th© sentencing
phase and afcer instructions — and these instructions are
required to be carried out with the jury and the jury make its
findings and indicate- what th© aggravating circumstances are.
This record reveals, if 1 recall correctly, that some three
were submitted.

Th© jury returned

its verdict and made its

recommendation of death, which was binding upon th© court when
that recommendation is mad©.
our law.

It was a substantive change in

Before that th® jury made its finding, if it made

a recommendation of mercy, then only a life sentence could be
imposed.

If it returned a verdict of guilty in these cases,

then it was th® automatic death sentence.

This

This was in addition to

the usual and normal appeal which was done in this case»

in this report,

One of the issues

No. 7 on page 3b on the end, "Was there

evidence of mitigating circumstances?"

The trial court says

"No. "
This removes from consideration the evidence that was
adduced in this case and where there was a written statement
exculpatory in nature taken at the time of the arrest, this
removed it, and I submit removed it in th© appellate level.
It must, be remembered that in this case, and I would apologize
for going into the evidence to this point, but upon arrest in
North Carolina, Gregg mad© a statement to the Georgia
authorities when they questioned him about what had happened.
It was exculpatory in nature in that h© said there was a fight
and he did it in self-defense.

There was evidence in the

record, including th© lip of on© Sam Allen and some evidence
as to some abrasions on the hands of one of th© victims.

But Gregg was carried from Asheville down Interstate 85
past the most direct rout® to Lawrenceville sometime before
daybreak early in th® morning in the presence of and after
having been transported from Asheville to this area with the
district attorney, the prosecuting officer, in the back seat

tried to keep this evidence out.

I objected strenuously,

Notwithstanding this, on the

trial of this case when it was charged, the effect of the charge
in this case is to submit to this jury the question you either
acquit him or you convict him.

Th© lesser included offenses of

manslaughter, or even the statutory right of a jury to find
an attempt, even if a crime was committed, affectively deprive
the jury of any discretion except you either find him — it’s

7
either murder or justifiable homicide.

That's what fell© charge

is in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, do you say it deprived them of an

opportunity to find him not guilty, acquit him totally?
MR. HARRISON %
QUESTION:

No, sir, certainly —

The dispensing factor is always there,

isn't it?
MR. HARRISON:

Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice.

But

also as a matter of right, I think a jury, at least in Georgia,
has a right to convict of a lesser included offense,
particularly in a capital cas©.

MR. HARRISON:

Not of necessity, your Honor.

I think

it comes back down to show whether w© us© equal protection in
this sens® of what happened to Allen.

There were two people

who ware involved in an incident, two people, on© suffering
the death sentence and on© going away with 1G years, for no
reason, no explainable reason.

The jury rejected it and that apparently is the end
He is still suffering th® death penalty and he is under

it today, two of them.

attempt to meet Furman, and it hasn’t done it.
that discretion, both in the prosecution.

It still leaves

I submit to you,

whether it’s right or wrong, and I would b® the first to admit
that soma discretion must foe vested in a prosecuting attorney.
We must have it.

But is that to be unlimited, and is it to have

the right to carry with it, "You live, you die.”
QUESTION:

Do you take the position that the existence

of that discretion is fatal to the 8th Amendment arguments?
You go along with the arguments, in other words, that Mr.
Amsterdam and others —■
MR. HARRISON; I would follow that argument, Mr.
Chief Justice, and in particular to -this point, that in the
end result whatever process we might have to get to that, that
here under this statute, the arbitrariness, no guidelines,
your Honor, there is nothing in the statute of Georgia --a man
can be indicted for murder and before that case is called to

and that’s fch® end of the case.

The only limitation on it is that once it's submitted
to a jury, then he must have the approval to dc it.
QUESTION;

The court has no power over a noil pros?

MR. HARRISON;

Except, your Honor, when it becomes

really affected in the breast of the court for trial.

Before

that case is called for trial, the district attorney can just

9
nolle pros it.

He can determine when he calls ifc and if he will

call it.
QUESTION;

Could his successor reinstate that? go

ahead with the trial?
MB.. HARRISON;
QUESTION;

I'm sorry? I didn't understand.

Could his successor —- suppose the

county

attorney and prosecutor were removed by the Governor or some
other process? or h@ failed of reelection? could they proceed?
MR. HARRISON;

Of course? there is that remedy to the

ballot box? but he would have to proceed to reindict? and I am
sure the argument might be made? well? he doesn't indict? but
for all practical purposes he does? because ha attends upon
the grand jury, he prepares the indictment and submits it.
There is only? your Honor--the individual discretion
I submit to you is the only limitation on whether or not a
district attorney-“what he does.

Just as in this cas© — and

there could fo© no better illustration of it than in this case Sera Allan who was with him and under any theory of Georgia law?
he is just as guilty as Troy Leon Gregg.

We have no excuse to

us® him as a state's witness? no trade-off.
QUESTION;

He didn't testify? did h@?

MR. HARRISON;

No? sir.

His only appearance in this

case was to be brought to an adjunct to the courtroom
purpose of identification.
QUESTION;

for the

That was all.

Identifying him or his identifying your

10
client;?
MR. HARRISONi

No, sir, 1 believe it was for the

purpose of an officer identifying Sam Allen, if I recall it
correctly.
QUESTIONS

My understanding was Allen did not testify.

MR. HARRISON;

He did not.

He was just brought tc

the edge of the courtroom so he could be seen.
So it was not necessary, and the usual thing of
turning state’s evidence is not apparent here.

So this to me

is a perfect illustration of two people, equally guilty under
the theory of law, on© with 10 to 20 years, and the other with
the death penalty, with no prior record.
Now, your Honors, the ’73 Act is not intended at all ~~
it mad® no change in what happanad beyond the appellate level
and ar@cut.iv® clemency.

It’s in the area of being in the court

with the prosecutor, with the jury, and the trial judge, even
in his instructions, and 1 don’t think we can avoid that in
this instance, and tim uncertainty of what the jury is given to
find insofar as aggravating circumstances.
Mr. Justice Powell, you wore asking about some of the
broadness of the language that was contained in the North Carolina
statute.

The cod© section ©numerating these 10, if you look

on 8A of Appendix A,'you see they start.

enumerating these

aggravating circumstances.
QUESTION;

Thts appendix to the brief.

11
MR. HARRISON;
Number (2)

Of the respondent, yes»

RTh© offense of murder, rape, armed

robbery, kidnapping was committed while the offender was
engaged in the commission of another capital felony, aggravated
battery, dr the offens© of murder committed while the offender
was engaged in the commission of burglary or arson in the first
degree.n This was given to 'this jury.
(3)

U:

was not given.

And then (4)

was purported to be given and a compari­

son of this with what was actually given leaves much to be
desired, but!5ths offendar committed the of fens® of murder for
himself or another, for the purpose of receiving money or any
other thing of monetary value»K
Your Honors, the only proof of the taking of th®
money, of any money, was possibly that contained in tha
exculpatory statement taken in North Carolina and then the
purported transaction out in the early morning that Gregg denied.
Now,

(7), "Th® offense of murder, rape, armed

robbery, kidnapping, was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible
or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind,, or
an aggravated battery to the victim."
Aggravated battery under Georgia law today could
cover almost anything from a touch if it had intent to commit
harm.
QUESTIONs

Was this on*® covered in th© instructions?

12
MR. HARRXSONs
your Honor.

This was given in the instructions,

Nos. (2), (4), and (7) were given, and they were

returned.
Your Honors, I think it's important to hear this
Georgia statute .

It sets and enumerates these ten, and some

reference is made to these being the statutory aggravating
circumstances.

But in the introduction there is no limitation

on the aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law.
What law?

What jurisdiction?

Where?

This is at th® top

of the pag®, Mr. Chief Justice, under B 27-2534.
QUESTION:

In this context do you think that is

something you can’t follow?
MR. HARRISON?

I think it creates the confusion of

why have — if you are going to enumerate the statutory conditions,
why go back and cover th® whole Code from A to Z, as sight be
authorized by law?

And if we ar® going to do this, why do w®

leave mitigating circumstances undefined anywhere?
Now, it6s this uncertainty that permeates, that we
submit that this statute cannot meet th® Turman decision.
With that, your Honor, w@ submit that; under these
circumstances, that in this case we do not have to go to the
ultimate question of the death penalty under th.® 8th Amendment,
even -though we say that even th®r® w@ question the sufficiency
of proof to justify th® taking of human life.

Two wrongs don81

make a right, and whatever a man has done, he pays his penalty,

13
and we submit to the Court that there is a real 8th Amendment
issue.

And that's not to be tested by what a General Assembly

thinks.

It's to be tested by an interpretation of the

Constitution.
I would submit that a more proper test, and I submit
that this Court has consistently held that when you take away
a right# -that the burdens not necessarily be upon the person
accused.

Traditionally the authority of an individual accused

with a crime in this country to stand mute and be clothed with
the protection of the Constitution.
"I am not guilty.”

Ho doesn't have to say#

He doesn't have to say anything but# "I am

hero#" and h© doesn't have to say that.

That the cloak of the

Constitution protects# and when w© lose sight of this# that the
State in order to coma to remove any facet of and particularly
the life# the most precious thing he has# that th© State must
prove it.
I submit in conclusion# your Honor# that tha Weems
case and the Robinson case and really th® Dulles case show
that this Court can take and can consider -any punishment
rn:;possible under the judicial system in this country today and
you can place it in tin© balance of does it meet the test of
the 8th Amendment without any apologies to anyone anywhere.
And that's where this comes down to.

The bottom line is# is

it justified, or has th® Government proven that it is such
a punishment, has it proven that there is such a deterrent that

14
in 1976

we will continue to impose the death penalty under

such conditions when we don't know for sura.
QUESTION:

You cited among others the Dulles cas8?

didn’t you?
MR. HARRISONs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

That has son»® language in it that isn't

very favorable to your side.
MR. HARRISONs

Yes, sir, but I believe the theory

or the idea there of looking into the punishment is present
here, Mr. Justice.
With that, your Honors, we would ask the Court to
reverse this decision, to follow the Furman line of cases
and that these two death penalties on this young man be reversed,
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Harrison.

Mr. Davis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. THOMAS DAVIS ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DAVISs
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

I argue on behalf of the State of Georgia.
Briefly at the beginning I wish to address a few of

the comments made by Mr. Harrison as to the facts of this case.
I do not wish to reargue the case factually.
The jury determined beyond a reasonable doubt that
Mr. Gregg was guilty of two murders with malic® while in the

15
commission of an armed robbery.

Mr. Harrison has intimated

that another raan involved in the crime was somehow arbitrarily
and capriciously not sentenced to death but given a sentence
in years.

Mr, Harrison has failed to point out that the other

man, Mr. Allen# involved was 16 years of ag® and could not have
been punished by death in Georgia.

Additionally# there was

no evidence to indicate that h© had any prior knowledge of
Mr. Gregg's planning to kill -these two men.
In response to this Court's decision in Furman# the
General Assembly of Georgia in 1973 enacted a new procedure#
a new death statute procedure.
discretion.

In doing so they allowed control!®

In complying with this Court's decision in Furman.

they eliminated arbitrariness and capriciousness from the
imposition# as this Court had held was present# they eliminated
that from th© imposition of the death sentence.

They did that

in several ways:
First, they set out 10 aggravating circumstances by
statute.

And as Mr. Harrison said# they also provided any

other aggravating circumstance allowed by law# otherwise
allowed by law# which simply means any ©th©r where in Georgia
law you could find an aggravating circumstance# and that# to
my knowledge, is only on® other place and only on© other
aggravating circumstance, which would be a prior conviction#
which is not included in th,© first statutory aggravated
circumstance which provides for prior capital convictions and

16
prior convictions of serious criminal assault.

„

words

In other

a district attorney could present in aggravation, let's

say, a prior burglary.

However, before a death sentence may

be imposed, the jury must determine beyond a reasonable doubt
the presence of one of the statutory aggravating circumstances.
It is true that the General Assembly did not define
mitigating circumstances.

They said mitigating circumstances

as otherwise provided by law.

Again, they are referring us

back to the general Bifurcated Trial

Act,

which allows

that open to the defense counsel to permit him to present
evidence of any factor which could legally he considered in
mitigation, not barred by the Constitution or rules of evidence
or some other general rule.

Thay provided in a vary important part for the
procedure for swift and immediate appellate review.

This review

was directed to include an examination of the record by the
Supreme Court of Georgia, an examination of a ferial report which
is included —the ferial report in this cas© by the trial judge
is included in Appendix B to respondent’s brief --to determine
the presence of any passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary
factor.
Second, they war© mandated by the General Assembly
of Georgia to determine whether the evidence

in fact supported

the aggravating circumstance found.
Ar.id, third, to examine other cases to determine whether

17
the sentence imposed in that particular case under review was
disproportionate to the sentence imposed in other similar
cases considering both the crime and the defendant»
A third thing the General Assembly did was to provide
for a bifurcated -trial procedar©»

They did not do this in

the Death Sentence Act, but it was don© before,
QUESTION s

This wasn't a bifurcated proceeding at

the trial level, was it?
MR, DAVISs

Yes, your Honor, it was.

First there

QUESTIONS

Yes, with th® judge instructing th© jury

at the second phase

giving them for consideration three of

ttm statutory aggravating circumstances and what, if any,

mitigating circumstances.

In th® report to the appellate court

he said there were none,
MR, DAVISt

That-s right.

He indicated there was no

evidence submitted at the second phase of -th© trial in
mitigation.

I think that's what he had tendered on -the court,

and h© saw non® in the trial-in-chief.

QUESTION:

You responded to Mr. Justice Stewart that

there were two stages, two separata proceedings. Bat there are
some crimes in Georgia which do not call for separate penalty
proceedings, isn’t that true?

They are also given to the jury in

The jury — and of course argument by his counsel.

Before he does this, of course, there is the opportunity for
counsel to present additional evidence of aggravation or of
mitigation.
QUESTION:

In this case, as I understand, no evidence

of mitigating circumstances was offered by the defendant.

13
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.
And the jury in bringing in a verdict of

recommending death, or bringing in a verdict of the death
sentence, must include at least one of the statutory aggravating
circumstances as found, at least one, and must so state and
identify which on®?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

That's right.

In writing.

In writing.
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

I believe, if I understood Mr. Harrison correctly,
he stated that the jury found three statutory aggravating
circumstances in this case.

My recollection is they found two.

Three were submitted to them, they refused to find No. (7) .
Looking specifically now at the 10 statutory aggravat™
ing circumstances in Georgia, they are set out at pages 28
and 29 of respondent's brief.

A number of these aggravating

circumstances have been attacked, either by petitioner or
amicus on behalf of petitioner, as being overly broad,as
being meaningless.

I want to look, at a few of those now.

Take No. (3) which says chat the act of murder and
armed robbery or kidnapping, knowingly creating a great risk
of harm or death to anyone in a public place by means of a
weapon, and so on, and endangering the lives of more than on®
person.
That could fit many things.

But to understand the

20

Georgia death sentence, one must look at the bare wording of
the statute in light of the refinement added by the Supreme
Court of Georgia.

The case of Marcus Wayne Schenault vState,

this was the statutory aggravating circumstance that was found.
What Mr. Schenault did was to enter Ebenezer Baptist Church
in Atlanta on Sunday morning during the worship service; he
sprayed the congregation with gunfire, killing two members
of that, congregation, and if I recall correctly, wounding
others.

Now, the jury had no difficulty in finding statutory

aggravating circumstance No. (3).
On the other hand — and the Supreme Court, of course,
had no difficulty in affirming it as being supported by the
evidence.

However, on the other hand, in the case of Jarrell v.

State, which was a case in which the defendant abducted a
woman at guixpoint in a shopping center parking lot, the State
sought aggravating circumstance No.

(3).

The Supreme Court of

Georgia said no, the evidence did not support it.
QUESTION;
MR, DAVIS:

You said the State sought it.
They submitted evidence.

The jury

returned it,and the Supreme Court of Georgia —
QUESTION;

To that extent the Supreme Court can

review the specific decision of the jury.
MR. DAVIS:

Very definitely.

And again, the point I was attempting to make, of
course, is that the entire picture is not present when one

21
looks at the bar© wording of these aggravating circumstances.
Under Georgia's procedure, the Supreme Court plays such a
major role, that to understand them one must deal with the
refinements added by the Supreme Court of Georgia.
Another statutory aggravating circumstance they
attack as being meaningless and overbroad is No.
involves torture and depravity of mind.

of money, separated them, threatened the mother with cutting
fingers off the daughter, brought then together, knelt them
down, put the gun to the daughter's head, kissed her good-bye

They also attacked, and interestingly so, the

aggravated battery.

They cite the case of Mitchell v. Stata

to support the misuse of that, and I think one of the lav;
professors they quote makes the remark that aggravated battery
could apply to anyone murdered.

QUESTION:

This statute has been in effect since

1973, Mr. Davis?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Do you happen to know how many death

sentences have been imposed under it?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

By our records, 55.
And how many of those, if any, have bean

set aside by the Supreme Court of Georgia?
MR. DAVIS:

One has been completely set aside.

There

have been a number of cases where there were e. number of death
sentences imposed and they have set various ones of -those
aside.

The case of Coley v. Scat© Is one that, they completely

vacated the death sentence.
QUESTION:
Compared to what?

By completely, what do you mean, completely?
I mean, how can it — what do you mean by

that?

MR. DAVIS:

For example, compared to this case, Gregg.

Gregg was sentenced to four death sentences by the jury.
QUESTION:

Two death sentences.

But let's talk about

people, not how many sentences imposed on them.
MR. DAVIS:
Right.
i
QUESTION: On© out of 55 people who were convicted
\

to death, cr sentenced to death, one of those 55 the death
sentence was reversed by the Supreme Court of Georgia, is that
it?

MR, -DAVIS;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
And what, a new trial ordered, or what

happened in that case?
MR. DAVIS;

There wouId be a new trial as to

punishment.
QUESTION;
MR. DAVIS;

Mo possibility of a death, sentence.
No possibility of the death sentence.

Let m© point out for clarity, however, when I used
the figure 55, there have not been 55 cases to go before the
Supreme Court of Georgia.

I was answering thes question of how

many death sentences were imposed.
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS;

Yes.
The Supreme Court of Georgia has decided

30 or 31.
QUESTION;

Bora® involved co-defendants, did they,

or what?
MR. DAVIS;

No.

It depends on what stage of the

process •—
QUESTION;

Some have not yet arrived at the Supreme

Court.
MR, DAVIS;

Some have been decided, some have been

docketed, not decided, and some — this 55 figure includes
up to within two weeks ago.
QUESTION;

So that. I understand your answer, 54

people now under sentence of death in Georgia, but some of whose

25
convictions have not yet been reviewed on appeal.
MR. DAVISs

That’s correct, your Honor.

Leaving the statutory aggravating circumstances and
going to the appellate review, in responding to this Court's
decision in Furman, the General Assembly, of course, was
faced with the problem — with having to approve arbitrariness
or capriciousness in fact on their procedure.

The General

Assembly determined not to eliminate the authority of the jury
or the trial judge to bring to bear in a case the community
values and their first-hand understanding of the facts in that
particular case.

They wanted to allow the judge

or the jury,

the fact-finder, to tailor-make the punishment to the defendant
in that particular case, keeping in mind and reiterating the
principles sat down by this Court in Witherspoon and in
McGautha, and at the same time eliminating arbitrariness and
capriciousness from the procedure.

Of course, they did that

with the statutory aggravating circumstances, but very
importantly, with the appellate review, which mandates, as I
have stated earlier, the specific review by the Supreme Court
of Georgia for the presence of any arbitrary factor.

They

enunciate passion, prejudice, or any other, according to
statute, arbitrary factor.

The court is to examine in detail

the record, the trial report, which is a number of pages long.
In the trial report there are six questions which deal with
whether race v/as in any vay an issue in that case.

26

Second, of course, the in-depth determination of
whether the evidence supported the aggravating circumstance.
Both of those, of course, look to the case itself to insure
fairness and non-arbitrariness in that particular case.
The third standard and the third thing mandated by
the General Assembly was to compare this case with the other
cases, and the statute says "other similar cases," considering
defendant, considering crime.

And, of course, the court has

the power if it finds any of that, to vacate the death
sentence.

This is in addition, of course, to the normal

appellate review.
That was the mechanism, or at least a principal
mechanism, which was placed into the Georgia death penalty
procedure to ensure non-arbitrariness.
petitioner say to that?

But what does

In brief they point to two cases as

being a prime example of arbitrariness on behalf of the
Supreme Court of Georgia.

They point to the case of Coley.

Coley was a rap© case, an escaped felon, he was robbing a
store, abducted a woman, raped h©r, and was apprehended.
was sentenced to death by the jury.
Georgia vacated it.

He

The Supreme Court of

Disproportionate,

The case of Coker, an escaped felon., who goes out,
outers a home, rapes a young woman who had giVfen birth three
vsgks before in th© presence of her husband, abducts her, and
is apprehended.

He is sentenced to death.

The Supreme Court.

27
of Georgia affirmed.
What petitioner does not. point out to the Court is
that Coker, the second case, had prior convictions for rape
and kidnapping, on® instance, another instance for rape,
aggravated assault, another instance of rape and murder, a
brutal murder of a young girl that he had raped.

These factors

were certified and submitted to the jury under statutory
aggravating circumstance Ho.

(1).

I submit there is no

arbitrariness there, that there is no lack of reason, there
is no lack of justification.

It would seem apparent to anyone

of common human understanding why Coker6s death sentence was
affirmed and Coley's was vacated.
If I understand the arguments

of

petitioner and

the arguments made yesterday and earlier, what is being
complained of under tlx© 8th Amendment is arbitrariness in
fact.

Now, as I understand the case of Furman, it did not

say that discretion was unconstitutional, but that arbitrariness
or a system which lad to arbitrariness in fact or the wanton
and freakish imposition of a death sentence was what was
unconstitutional.

If so, and if that's the way I understand,

and I was listening to the way he used the word "arbitrary1"'
or "arbitrariness," and h© said spar® for no meaningful basis,
without rhyme or reason, without justification, no rational
basis.

If that is the standard, what has been shown about

the Georgia procedure-?

Has arbitrariness in fact been

28

demonstrated to any degree?

W© maintain that what must be

avoided is the wanton and freakish imposition,, not that everyon® who should get a death sentence under a system of justice
or concept of justice, that a few escape, but have they even
shown anyone escaping?
It's interesting to note some footnotes in their
brief where they try to bracket and compare cases in Georgia
and say in one crime one is Gregg,this case, two cold-blooded
murders and an armed robbery, Gregg is sentenced to death.
They cite: the case of Brannon v. State, two cold-blooded
murders in the course of an arated robbery, sentenced to life
imprisonment by the jury.
What they failed to not© is that Brannon was 14 years
of age, and 1 seriously ask this Court, in considering those
cases, in those briefs, to look below the surface facts shown.
In almost every case, cited, you will se® th® circumstantia.-,
evidence appearing, you will see the felony murder appearing,
not fcho malice murder# felony murder, confused evidence as to
who was the perpetrator, th© youth, the question about mental
capacity.

They appear in every case cited.
Th© statutory aggravating circumstances in Georgia

with.th© appellate review has -led to a group of criminals
who have committed horrible, vile, henious crimes being
sentenced to death.
QUESTION?

Mr. Attorney General, might I ask what

29
your judgment is on a comparison between this group of 55 who
now have received the death sentence as to the pre-Furman
experience under the statute?

Would you say there are more or

less death penalties than there were before?

Do you have a

judgment on it?
MR. DAVIS;

I really do not* your Honor»

I don't

know what —
QUESTION;

I don't want you to say it if you don't,

have a thought already in mind.
Secondly, could you tell us how many of the 55 are
for rape and how many are for murder, if you know?
MR, DAVIS;

Of the total 55, I could not say.

Of those

that have bean docketed and have been decided by the court,
there are three for rap©, one of which is Coker
with his priors.

I have discussed

The other two was rape and kidnapping together

with a woman staked out over a
had prior capital crime convictions.
QUESTION;

Any for robbery?

bed.

They also

Those were the only rapes.
I know these robbery

death sentences ware set aside on a comparability basis, and
that would imply that there are no existing death sentences for
1
robbery.
MR. DAVIS;
QUESTION;
MR. DAVIS;

That's right.
Although the statute does provide it.
The statute provides it.

But looking to

ti:: ::«£ine?i;e;:nt added by the Court.: the Court has said that a

30
death sentence for armed robbery in Georgia, in other words,
if you took the facts of Gregg, eliminated the two murders,
that's disproportionate and a death sentence cannot be imposed.
So there are none in Georgia, armed robbery without murder.
QUESTION

Hi® court didn91 quit® say that under

Georgia law it could never b© imposed..

Mo reason why it shouldn't.

It said that.
MR. DAVISs

Mo.

Of course, what the court said would

have to be considered in light of the facts present in Gregg,
and of course the same thing with the rap® that was present in
Coley.
The General Assembly of Georgia, of course, determined
that a death sentence is justified in Georgia, is needed in
Georgia, of course, for a number of reasons — for deterrence,
specific deterrence, general deterrence.

We have some of those

under death sentence now who were under life sentences for
capital crimes who committed more capital crimes on escape.
So we have the problem with specific deterrence.
The General Assembly of Georgia, as a matter of policy,
has determined that there is a general deterrence by the death
penalty.

We respectfully submit that the Constitution does not

demand that the balance of fear weigh more heavily on the
citizen than on the potential capital criminal.

We think that

petitioner has not demonstrated arbitrariness or caprieiousness
iv. what has happ.-msd urtb r Georgia's death penalty statute».

31
As we understand Furman„ that’s what was held to be
unconstitutional.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank, you, Mr. Davis.

(Whereupon, at 2;17 p.m„, the arguments in the
above-entitled matter were concluded.)
