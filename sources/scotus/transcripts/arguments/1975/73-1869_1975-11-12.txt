MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. STONER IN
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
%

MR. STONER;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it pleas©

The case before the Court this time is re argument

of the New Orleans redistricting case.
of New Orleans.

It involves the City

The case involves geography, the case

involves the evolution of a political system whereby those
people can express their views and be governed by their
alected officials.
The City# as is most cities in our country# has a
black population ana a white population.

The case comes

before the Court pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
I refer the members of the Court to page 620 of tha appendix
and I .call attention to a map of the City of New Orleans which
shows the distribution of whit© and black voters in the City of
New Orleans.
QUESTION;
MR. STONER;

Isn’t there a map in cur appendix her©?
It is# your Honor.

It is in the

appendix at page 620.
QUESTION;
MR. STONER;

620.
And it is a color map showing the

4
black voters in red and the whit® voters in green.

And 1

should like to call the Court9s attention to the fact that
this map very graphically shows the distribution of black
voters throughout the city of Hew Orleans, and it shows
very graphically the distribution of whit® voters throughout
fch© city of New Orleans# and it shows that th©r© are substantial
blocs- of black voters in ©very section of the city of New
Orleans.
Now# going back in tim© to May 1# 1954 -— and I
might say that this was substantially before the Voting Rights
.feet of 1965 was enacted into legislation# it was substantially
before the one-man-one-vote rule was decided by this Court —
' the City of New Orleans adopted a reorganisation of its city
government.

It adopted a city charter which was called the

Home Rule Charter and which adopted the Mayor-Council type of
government.

It established for the first time a Mayor who

had the primary responsibility of being Executive of the city#
and it established a City Council with primarily the legisla­
tive function.
QUESTION?
MR. STONERz

That was what year?
That was on May 1# 1954.

1954.

Th® Home Rul© City Charter established a City
Council as the legislative body consisting of two members who
would foe elected at large# that is# from the entire city by
the entire population of the city of New Orleans»

5

Xt also established five single-member districts,
so that the entire City Council# the legislative body, consisted
of s©v<an members, two elected at large# five elected from
individual districts within the city.
Now# the City Charter, the Home Rule Charter
adopted on May 1# 1954, had another important provision# and
that important provision made it mandatory for the City
Council to redistrict itself# that is# the five individual
districts, after every decennial census.

This was an attempt

to require that each single-member district would be made up
as closely as possible an equal number of voters.
In 1961# following the first decennial census
after the adoption of the Home Rule Charter# the City Council
did in fact redistrict itself.

Now, at that time there ware

no challenges to the redistricting# and members were elected
from the five individual districts and also, of course# from
the two at-large districts.
In 1969, the present City Council for the City of
New Orleans was elected.

They took office in May of 1970.

Of course, 1970 was a census year, and under 'the requirement
of the City Charter# the City Council was required to redistrict
the five districts

following that census and prior to the

next election which would have been held, under normal
schedules# in the fall of 1973 with the elected officials to
take office in May of 1974.

6
QUESTION %

These are four-year terms.

MR. STONER?
QUESTIONs

They are four-year terms.
Yesterday we had a grandfather clause

enacted by this Council.
MR. STONER:

These ax© four-year terms for each

member of the Council.

That is the at-large members as well

as the members from the single-member districts.
Now, in 1965 Congress passed the Voting Rights Act
of 1955 and its application to th© change of fell® red!sfcricting
is not attacked in this case.

Everyone admits that it was the

City Council, having redistricted itself

following that

Act,was required to submit the plan to the Attorney General.
Now, the City Council adopted a plan of redistricting»
It held extensive public hearings.

During the extensive

public hearings, it was evident that large segments of the
community felt that the sisse of the City Council should b©
increased.,

The Council adopted a plan to increase feh® size

of th® City Council from seven members to eleven members,
retaining two at large and;.proposing to elect nine members from
single-member districts.

This was submitted to the electorate,

it was defeated.
Again, feh® City Council adopted another plan whereby
the City Council would be! enlarged from a seven-member council
to a nine-member councile two to be elected at large, seven
from single-member districts.

This plan was presented to feh©

7
electorate, it was defeated.
Now, at that point the City Council was faced with
the mandatory requirement that it redistrict itself and that
it redistrict itself in accordance with a seven-member Council,
which was the law, it having submitted the eleven-member
proposal and the nine-member proposal to the electorate and
having been defeated.

At that time the City Council adopted

Plan II,

is th® plan which is now before this

and Plan II

Court.
it submitted the plan to th® Attorney General for
v

approval, the Attorney General did not approve th® plan,
whereupon the City Council believing that the plan was a
reasonable and rational plan for rediatrIcfcing itself filed
suit in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia asking for a declaratory judgment.

That court denied

the request, for th® declaratory judgment, and it is from that
decision which we have appealed and which brings this case to
the Court: at th.® present time.
May 1 refer th© Court to page 621 of the appendix
which shews a map of the City of New Orleans and th© districts,
the various districts as they were established.in 1961, and
indeed which is the present district plan.
QUESTION;
MR. STONER:

What page?

Is this 62.1?

621, Mr. Justice.

The City Charter required that the Council redistrict

8
itself.

I should ilk© to point out the geography.

I mentioned,

in ray opening statement that geography is involved in this
matter.

If you will look at the City of Hew Orleans, you will

see that one of the predominant geographic features is the
Mississippi River which flows through the city.

There is only

one part of the city that is west of the Mississippi, and that
in the plan which I have referred to is a part identified
A(part) and that section of the city is west of the Mississippi
and is known as the Algiers section.
QUESTION:

And it certainly is separated from the

other part of A in 61, isn’t it?
MR. STONERs
QUESTION:
MR, STONER:

It is, your Honor.
Mot connected at all.
It is substantially separated.

And

this 1». an important factual feature in the consideration ©f
Plan I »

which is before the Court.
Let me say that there is substantial evidence in the

record which shows the citizens of Algiers were very interested,
in having a bridge across the Mississippi River,
some way to get — I should say another bridge.

They wanted
They wanted

some way to get from the western part of th® city on the west
side of the Mississippi to th© central and main part of th®
city.

Tha many citizens across th® river, -that is, in the

main section of the city were opposed to this, and this was
a very hotly debated issue.

Many people wanted th© bridge to

9
be somewhere alsa

in some other section of the city.

Bo

this factor was an important factor in considering the
reapportionxnant, the radistricting of the city.
Referring to page 624* which is likewise a map of
the city and which shows Plan II* which is the plan before the
Court today.

You will not® that in the plan that has been

adopted as Plan II, the section of Algiers is connected with
a contiguous area across the Mississippi Rivar so that
District C comprises the entire Algiers section of the city
as well as some of the riverfront section of the city and up
into the major downtown area of the city and in fact running
to Lak© Pontcharfcrain* which is at the very top of the page.
QUESTION;

Page 624?

MR. STONERs

On. 624.

That is Plan II, namely, the

plan which is presently before the Court.
QUESTION;

Right.

And I take it that's the same,

really, as that on 620,
MR. STONER;

It is, your Honor.

It is, your Honor?

620, however, has the color added showing th-a distribution of
black and white voters in the city.
Now, the City Council adopted -this plan, taking into
consideration numerous factors, not the least of which is the
importance of the Mississippi River and the commerce and the
industry that is along the river to the City of New Orleans,
to the well-being of the people of the City of New Orleans.

10

And there is evidence in the record to show that Connc.il
members believed that it was important that each section in
the city, that is, ©ach district, should have a part of the
geography of the riverfront in th© district so that each
member of th© City Council would have the economic interest
of the effect of the river on th© population and on th© life
\

and industry and commerce of the city.
You will not® that Plan II does in fact contain a
part of th© riv®r frontage in ©ach of the five member
districts.

W® submit that Plan II is a reasonable plan, that

it has b@®n adopted taking into consideration reasonable,
rational reasons for the adoption of th® plan and the division ,
of the city in -th® districts as presented.
QUESTION:

Division D, of course, is pretty short

on the river compared to th® others, isn’t it?
any difference?

Does it mak®

Or mayfo© there is a concentration of industry

along D.
MR. STONER:

I believe that th© lower part of th©

city is substantially a dock area with ~
QUESTION:

Th© river area for D is far less than

all of th© others.
MR. STONER:

St would appear to be, yes, sir, it is.

This is th© plan that was presented to th© United
States District Court for the District of Columbia, and this
is th© plan out ©f which has com® the appeal which we have

11
before the Court today.
The most important aspect of the error which the
district court mad© was its error in holding that the two
at-large seats on the City Council were affected by and must
be included in any plan that is considered under the Voting
Rights Act of 965»

W@ submit that this is patently wrong.

The City Charter creates two seats whose members are elected
at large, it creates the five districts also.

Thera has been

no change, no change, in the two at-large voting system since
its adoption in May 1 of 1954.
Now, the Voting Rights Act applies to any changes
that ar© mad© in voting procedures following, 1 believe th©
date is November I, 1964.
QUESTIONS

I gather from th® supplemental brief

th© Government agrees with you on this point.
MR. STONER:

It does.

That is my understanding, and

I believe that is a change —
QUESTION:

I gather they argu©d it last time, as I

recall.
MR. STOKERs

I believe that ic correct,

W© submit that th® lower court erred in holding that
the two at-large seats were changed.

We submit that there

was in affect a two-segment voting procedure.

On© was electing

two Council members at large, and th© other was electing
five members from single-member districts divided in equal

12

population numbers.

W@ submit that fch© afc-larg© seats are

not in any way affected by 'this.

We submit that they are not

affected by the Voting Rights Act of 865, and that they
should not be considered.

The court erred and substantially

erred in holding that the two at-large seats wera affected by
the redistricting plan.
I might point out that the two at-large seats, in
addition to th@ir regular responsibilities as Council members,
have other responsibilities that are prescribed by the Charter.
For instance, the chairmanship of the City Council rotates
every four months between the two members at large.

Further­

more, fch® two members at large sit on various city agencies.
One is the reduction of debt — that is not th© correct term,
but it, is described in our brief — th® Stadium Commission,
and so forth.

So that th© two members at large hav© somewhat

differant responsibilities and responsibilities that are over
and above th® responsibilities of all fch® other members of th®
City Council.

So that in effect tea.plan —- and again I

can't emphasis® too strongly that this was a plan adopted
back In 1954, long before the Voting Rights Act and before
any other attacks.

And that plan, incidentally, was never

attacked by any voter, to my knowledge, that claimed that there
was something constitutionally wrong with fch.© City Charter
adopted in 1954.

Sfe had never been attacked.

Mow, in this respect, this cas© is different than

13
many other casos that have come before this Court under the
Voting Rights Act of 855.
gone out and annexed land.

This is not & c&s© where a city has
It is not a case where a city has

changed its basic philosophy of electing its legislative body.
It is a case where there has teen no change of any kind in
the City Charter and in the establishment of this City Council,
except that following th© mandatory requirement that the
charter required, namely, that every ten years, after every
decennial census, it must redistrict itself so that each of
th® single-member districts ar© divided as nearly as possible
into districts of equal population.
So I submit to the Court that this case is different
than other cases that have coma before the Court.

It is not

a case where there is any attempt or any blatant attempt or
any apparent attempt or any so-called attempt to change a city
form of government or to change an ©lection procedure.

It is

merely changing th® districts of th® five individual districts
as is required by the forward-looking, and I submit it was a
forward-looking, City Charter that was adopted in 1954»
So the case is unique and th© case is different from
other cases that hav© com© before the Court in that respect.
And the only matter before th® Court is whether or not th©
five-member plan encompassed in Plan II is a reasonable plan
and a rational plan and that does not violat® th® Voting Rights
Act, of 1965 and does not deny or abridge th® right of any

14
citizen to cast his vote in a municipal ©lection.
Now, w® submit that th© court below erred in its
application of the test.

We say -that the proper test to be

applied to this plan is whether or not it is a reasonable
plan* whether or not it is a rational plan, whether or not it
is bassid on reasonable considerations that a city council
should take into Qonsid@rat5.on whan it adopts a plan of
redistricting itself.
We have set forth th© criteria which have been used
in ©nr brief which were used in adopting the plan.
I might say parenthetically that traditionally th©
lines of the various districts have run in a north-south
manner.

Now, this is not happenstance.

The City of New

Orleans, r guess, as we all know, is built basically on a
swampland, and in recapturing the land numerous canals were
built to take away th© excess water, and so forth.

Now, these

canals basically run in a north-south direction, and they
basically run from th® Lakes Pontchartrain area to th® •

v

Mississippi River.
If you will not®, th© 1961 plan runs in a north-south
direction.

Indeed, the old ward lines in th® city ran in a

north-south dirsction.

And 1 believe those wards war®

established in th® late 18006s or early 1900es.

So that

traditionally in the city the main arteries of 'the city ~
1 am talking canals and in later years the streets, the

15
predominant streets, do run in a north-south directione
Th© plan has great basis in reasonableness. It has
followed th® traditional lines of the city, it has followed
the traditional movement of the city.

It has taken into

consideration th® important economic interest of th®
Mississippi River and th© commerce and jobs that it produces.
In addition to that, referring again to th® population spread,
I must point out that the blade population is spread throughout
the city.

It is not a population that is concentrated in

on© area;iof the city as w® all know happens in many of our
great urban areas.

Rather, th© black population is spread

throughout th® city, and I submit that indeed th® plan that
is before th® Court is a plan which has members of the Council
representing black voters, representing white voters,
representing the interests of th® Mississippi River, represent­
ing th© interests of th© Lake Pontchartrain area.

It is a

diversified interest, and I submit that in a plan of government
this is a strength.

It is th® strength of th© system and may

in fact b® th© genius of th© Mayor-Council form of government
adopted by th® City of New Orleans, namely, it has th© two
at-large seats which represent all of th© people and are
answerable to all of the people of tlx© City of New Orleans.
In addition to that, it has single-member districts which
are answerable to th® people within that district, but at the
same time, rather than being answerable only to on® segment

16
of the society , on® segment of the community, they ar©
answerable to a broad spread of interests and therefor©,

it

would appear that members of the Council who are answerable to
broad segments of the population# that ar© answerable to broad
economic interests, to broad social interests will together
provide a better government, better form of government, than
will a number of members on a City Council, each on® of whom
is answerable to a very tight segment of the population.
We submit that this is one of the great strengths
of the plan that has been submitted and is before the Court.
Now, the lower court mad© on® other serious error
that wet feel is important and should be brought to the
attention of the Court at this time in addition to those
fully expressed in our brl©£.

And that is that the district

court fas said that the burden of proof on th® city is fch©
burden of proving that the plan presented is th© only, and I
quote "only1’ plan that is feasible.
an improper burden of proof.

We submit that this is

We submit in a declaratory judg­

ment the pr@pondo.ranc® of the evidence should ba th© test that
no reasonable person can assume -that in th® myriad problems
involved in a redistricting that there can be only one plan.
We submit that the court erred in that.
Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve a few moments for
rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Stoner.

17
Mr. Wallac®»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G, WALLACE ON
BEHALF OF APPELLEE UNITED STATES
MR. WALLACE %
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justicee and may it pleas®

As we see the case, it presents two issues for

review here.

The first is a very narrow issue addressed in

our supplemental brief; and that is whether the continued
existence of fch® two at-large seats was a matter requiring
preclearance under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. As
w© explain in our supplemental brief; w® take a generous view
of what constitutes the change that requires review under
section 5; but we don’t take a view that stretches this far
because there is no reconsideration or readoption of the two
at-large seats and their status and voting strength on the
City Council; on fch® seven-member Council; remains unchanged.
QUESTION!

Is there a generality that as long as a

change does not involve some harm to fch® black voters as
compared to what it. was"before that th© Attorney General has
no power?
MR. WALLACES

That is not our standard; Mr. Justice.

That seems to me to be a question going to th© merits one©
section 5 applies.

And it's a matter of approach to th®

merits.
QUESTION?

Suppos® someone says to you; Look; this

plan may b© bad; but it’s no worse than the prior plan.

W®

18

didn't hurt anybody as compared to fch® prior plan.
no change in that regard.
MR. WALLACE:

There is

Does section 5 apply?

Wall, if there is a change in fch©

procedure, there is a redistricting,

section 5 applies,

and we think that's an erroneous substantive standard under
section 5 which I will get to in a moment on the other aspect
of the case.
We think the question of the two at-larg© seats is
an extremely narrow on® hares,

It was a question which was

not necessary to the district court's judgment, but on
reflection in this caaa, w® think that this Court does-have
to say something addressed to it because otherwise it will
govern what future plans can be cleared by the Attorney
General upon submission by Mew Orleans.
QUESTION*

What is the provision of the Act you

rely on to support the district court's selecting as the
standard, the"only feasible plan"?

What provision of the Act

.generates that as fch© tost?
MR. WALLACEt

1 don't think that was based on any

provision, of the Act.
QUESTIONs;

Where do they get the authority if it's

not of the Act?
MR. WALLACE:

I think that was the district court's

approach to attempting t© assess whether th® plan has the
purpose or it had the effect of abridging the right to vote,

20

purposes of section 5 than this Court articulated it in
White v.

Reges ter and Whitcomb

v.

Chavis ..in a quotation which

appears on page 15 of our principal brief.
QUESTION:

Even if there is an improvement#.it still

may violate the statute.
MR. WALLACE:

If the effect or the purpoa© is to

deny or abridge the right to vote on fch® basis ©f ras@# fcher#
is a statutory violation even 'though it's not as bad an
abridgment as it was before.

That's always been our reading

of the Act and our administration of the Act.
QUESTION:

And even though it would survive any

sort of constitutional attack.
MR, WALLACE:

Well# there is a differanc® in the

burden of proof under the Act# and I would say# yes# substantival
as well on -the basis of fch© prophylactic intent expressed in
the Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace# what if the City Council

sits down and says# this existing plan that w® have now

that

wasn’t subject to fch© Voting Rights Act does seem to us a
little bit unfair fc© blacks# so w@ are going to giv® them a
better break.

And they decide to pass this# assum® that this

correspond© to that description.

You say# then# that even if

it can h© shown in. the abstract that this plan has the purpose
or effect# even though it*s an improvement over their prior
lot#that

itas within fch® Act.

20

purposes of section 5 'than this Court articulated it in
White v.

Regester and Whitcomb

v-

Chavis in a quotation which

appears on pag® 15 of our principal brief.
QUESTIONS

Even if there is an improvement, i,t still

may violat® the statute.
MR. WALLACES

If th® effect or the purpose is to

deny or abridge the right to vote on th© basis of race, there
is a statutory violation ©van though it{s not as bad an
abridgment as it was before.

That3s always been our reading

of th® Act and our administration of th© Act.
QUESTION;

And ©van though it would survive any

sort of constitutional attack.
MR. WALLACEs

Well, there is © difference in the

burden of proof under the Act, and I would say, yes, substantival
as well on th® basis of th© prophylactic intent expressed in
the Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, what if ‘the City Council

site down and says, this existing plan that we have now

that

wasnst subject to th© Voting Eights Act does seem to us a
little bit unfair to blacks, so w@ are going to give -them a
better break.

And they decide to pass this, assume that this

corresponds to that description.

You say, then, that even if

it can be shown in the abstract that this plan has the purpose
or effect, even though it's an improvement over their prior
lot,that

it8s within the Act.

21
MR, WALLACES

That is our view of th® Act, because

tha Ac:t was designed to enforce th@ 15th Amendment .

And when

someone submits a proposal to us under the Act, we have feo
s©e whether it meets that stutorv purpose.
QUESTION?

Donr t you judge intent on the basis of

the circumstances that existed at th® time?
MR. WALLACES

It may ba that they can show that th®

purpose was not to deny or .abridge th® right to vote, but they
also have to show that th® effect is not to abridge or deny
th© right to vote.
QUESTIONS

As compared with th© previous plan?

MR. WALLACES

We don't think it's as compared with

the previous plan, because that would put us and th© district
court her© in the position of approving under the Act of
plans that don't meet ©v&n the substantive standards of th©
15th Amendment and then would be subject, to suit under the
15th Amendment,where th® Act was designed to have tbs opposite
effect, a prophylactic effect.
QUESTION?

I don't understand again why you say that

th© two at-large seats are implicated in this case, or at
least by section 5.
MR. WALLACES

Well, if they w@r© reconsidered or

readopted in any way, we would have said that they war© a
change, but -they haves existed in the same status since 1954
under a City Charter which does not provide for their

22

readoption or reconsideration.

The charter provides a

separate provision that the five district seats should be
redistricted, and that redistricting does not affect the
status of the two at™large seats on the seven-member Council
or the voting strength of th© two at-large seats.

There has

b@@n no reconsideration or r@adopti.on of th© two at-large seats
sine© the —
QUESTION?

Do you think the Richmond case

has

any relevance to this case?
MR. WALLACES

Only marginally, Mr. Justice, because

th© annexation problem is a somewhat different on® under th®
Act.
QUESTION:

You confine Richmond to annexation and

not providing JOEiii general standard for section 5 casea?
MR. WALLACE?

Well, I think i-t3s consistent with th®

general standard that's ba©n adopted in the Allen case and all
the subsequent cases as it applies in particular to th®
annexation context.
QUESTION:

Would you have th® same vi@w of th© two

at-large seats, Mr. Wallace, if there had in fact been an
annexation so that you had an enlargement of the —
MR. WALLACES

I think then you would have quits a

differant case because they would b© representing different
people.
QUESTIONS

Th® annexation unquestionably would, I

23
MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

'.[list at-large saafcs would have a

different electorate, and l*m quite sure we would take the
position that there would be a change with respect to them.
But here they hav© the same electorate.

Otherwise there's

& change every time someone dies and someone becomes 21 years
old.

But w® don't interpret change in that fashion — or

18 years old, I'm a little out of date on that.
The question, it. seems to us, and the question
resolved correctly by th® district court is whether the
standards adopted by this Court and developed by this Court
in the context of multi-member districts in White v. Regester
and Whitcomb

v.

Chavis,also apply to single-member districts,

and 1 am talking about the standard that w® have quoted on
pag® 15 of our brief, that idle political processes leading to
nomination and ©lection were not equally open to. participation
by fch© group in question,that its members had loss opportunity
than did other residents in.the district to participat© in
the political process and to elect legislators of their choice.
QUESTION:

In fact, that language is in the context

of the 14th Amendment issue, and her© we have a statutory
issue which related,if to any part of the Constitution, to
fch® 15fch Amendment.
MR. WALLACE z

That is correct.

But if anything, th®

15th Amendment would b© an a fortiori case protecting th©
voting strength of th® minority voters affected.

24
QUESTION?

Ths issue here is a statutory issue, is

it not?
ME. WALLACE;
QUESTION:

It is a statutory issue# your Honor,

Wholly,

MR, WALLACES

Wholly a statutory issue# but as w©

&rgu®#th® statuts implicates constitutional standards because
it was designed to enforce the guarantee of the'15th Amendment.
QUESTION:

You have told us — tell me if 1 sun

wrong in my understanding# Mr, Wallace — that even though the
previous plan would have been valid as against either a 14th
or 15th Amendment attack and even though the ehang® is an
improvement# vis-a-vis giving minority races an opportunity
to votes# nonetheless it might violat® the statute.
MR. WALLACE;

It might.

My answer is yes# it could happen.

think that's unlikely# and that isn't

what th© administration of th© Act has generally involved,

That may well fee what this case involves#

25
MR. WALLACES

We think not.

And lot. me try to

explain why.
QUESTION:

Yon said that the original plan was valid.

MR. WALLACES

No, your Honor.

We were never asked

to express a vi©w on that, but 1 would have to say that it was
not.
QUESTION z

What?

Under the Constitution of the

United States?
MR. WALLACES

No.

In terms of what we would approve

for preclearance purposes under section 5.
QUESTIONS

But that only involved a change.

MR. WALLACES

If the original plan had been

submitted to us, it's a change from a theretofore pr@sxisti.ng
plan, it would hav© gotten the same reaction as Plan II did.
QUESTIONS

You didn’t approve this on®, this is an

improvement over the old on®.

Obviously you wouldn’t hav©

approved the old one if it had been a change over some
predecessor.

That says nothing.

MR. WALLACES

Well, let m© try to say something, which

is that we think the standard for multi-member districts
developed in these cases has

to be the same standard that

applies to single-member districts, and we would illustrat®
that with the hypothetical that if, for example, New Orleans
were changed to a City Council with seven members, all elected
at large,that obviously would satisfy 14th Amendment standards

26
and yet there would b© a substantial basis for saying that
th© standards of White v,

Regester could be shown to hav© been

violated by such a districting.

Yet, it seems to us the result

would be th® same if instead of seven at-large members th©
city ware divided into seven districts so drawn — and this
would, b© theoretically possible, although difficult — that
each district contains exactly th© same proportion of black
and white voters ©f th® city at large, roughly 35 percent
black and 65 percent white.

Now, what was dona her® was nothing quit® so crude
as to draw th© districts in © way that each on© would
reflect exactly th© proportion of voting strength of th®
minority group in the city as a whole, but it approaches that
because , as you will notice in studying fch© plan — and I am
sorry my time is expiring here -- in each of the districts
except on® the blacks arc: merged into a district in which a
majority of whites has been put into the district by extending
the district in several cases from Lake Ponfcchartrain to th®
southern extremity ©f the city.

This was don© to perpetuat®

27
a system of districting of tin® city which may ha"#© been quite
understandable at © time when the blacks spread throughout
the middle ©f the city were not voting# were not registered#
war© not being allowed to register t© vote and it was necessary
to have some voters in each district so the districts were
elongated in that fashion®

But it seems t© us as it did to

the 'district court inappropriate to attempt to perpetuate it
in the present ©ontesst in light of the particular findings of
the district court which we elaborat® in our brief involving
&

responsiveness from the City Council to the needs of the

The district court's ©pinion is based

primarily on mathematical deductions which in turn ate based

I think voting age population is more

We had to extrapolate it from census figures

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERx

Mr. Haipin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. HALFIN, JR.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES JACKSON ET AL.
MR. HALPIN:
it please* the. Courts

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
Thar© were a number of questions posed

by the Court to which our answer is a bit different, and I
would like to just move right into that.
I would like to point out to the Court that our
position that th® section 5 standard involved here is
considerably more stringent than the standard Whit® v. Regester
or Whitcomb y, Chavis,

and that th© inquiry, th® proper

inquiry of a court unc&r section 5 is considerably mors
limited.
Specifically, 1 point out, of course

w® hav® in our

brief, that Congress has just reenacted section 5 for an
additional seven years with, the specific intention to hav®
th© Act cover redistricting for th© 1980 Census.

Congress is

particularly concerned, and I think the hearings and th®
testimony and so forth indicate that it's particularly concerned
that in these- areas wh©r© racial discrimination continuas to
be practiced, the newly enfranchised black voters will be
effectively disenfranchised by line-drawing districting which
will divi.de up black concentrations in these areas.

30
I think specifically this was the matter that
section 5 sought fco remedy in this type of case, a line­
drawing redistricting case.

And the inquiry should be a

narrow one,and that is whether there is a significant
concentration of black voting strength and whether or not
a districting plan divides up that population and spreads it
out into predominantly whits districts®

I think that is the

inquiry, and 1 think that5s exactly what is before the Court
in this case®
You have significant black concentrations of
populations in New Orleans in spite of what Mr. Stoner has
suggested®

You can walk from Jefferson Parish throughout

tea city for eight or ten miles through the St® Bernard
Parish lin® and not see a white face along that band, that
black belt, teat parallels the river in a curve fashion
throughout the city.

White people liv© in feh® very wealthy

sections of town out toy the lake and along St. Charles
Avenue to the river.

The rest is left over for blacks, and

thes© are heavy concentrations, and teat plan devised by the
City Council slices up that population Ilk® so many pieces
of baloney,and that's what Congress intended to prohibit.
Now, inquiry an to hew do you compare the previous
plans, what do you compare to?

1 think section 5 is,

Congress is very explicit, there is on® triggering device.
When you have a voting change,, then section 5 is triggered,

31
it's brought into effect.

And then the inquiry becomes as

to whether or not the matter is racially discriminatory or
not»
In redistricting cases, particularly beeaus® you
have operation of th@ one-man-one-vote mandate# you don't
have anything to go back to.

You don't have a previous plan

that you can really compare to, like you do in an annexation»
QUESTIONS

Did the court of appeals resolve the

purpose question?
MR» HAL?IN:
QUESTION:
MR. HALPIN:
QUESTIONS
MR. HALPINs

No, sir, they did not.
It went solely on effect?
Yes, sir.
What if we disagreed with them on effect?
Well, your Honor, if you disagree

with them on effect, I think the only appropriate thing would
b® to have the court of appeals consider and decide the
issue of purpose sine® that is primarily a fact question.
QUESTION:

Or really, I moan it was a three-judge

court«.
MR. HALPINs
QUESTIONS
MR. HALPINs

Yes, sir, the three-judge court.
Sorry.
Yes, sir.

But we would submit that

the City Council however was under a mandate in the first
plan.

Plan I was rejected.

To correct the defects of that

plan, I think it was quit© clear the Justice Department, th©

32
Attorney General in that instance, said the thing that you
did wrong is you divided up black population concentrations.
And in plain truth they didn’t attempt to remedy tills, but
rath©2" continued the division.

I think this was the fault

of the second plan as well as the first.
QUESTIONS

Where do you say Congress — what

provision of the Act authorizes -the standard that was used
by the court hare?

"The only feasible plan.”

Is there any

such idling as fch© only feasible plan?
MR. HALPXU;

Mo, sir.

Of course, there are always

many plans,- and X don’t think the standard is that this was
the only feasible plan.
QUESTXOMs

We (3an only go by what the court said

it wan using as a yardstick.
MR. HALF III:

Yes, sir.

I think where feasibility

comes in, what tlx© Act mandates,

is that where feasible

these lines not ha drawn in such a way that they divide up
the black community.

And that’s exactly what the Gllckstein

memorandum said was the moaning of section 5, which Senator
Bayh indicated, was th© propar statement of what the committee
recommending renewal of the Act

■

thought th® Act to mean.

And that, is that where feasible a line should not run right
through the center of black population concentrations.

X

think it’s quite clear'on th© feasibility issue that this is
what Congress meant in this type of case.

*

33

The standard here that I believe is quit© clear that
Congress has mandated under section 3 has some very practical
feasible effects as well.

Some standards have been vaguely

suggested^ I don't think the Government has really suggested
a clear standard as to what section 5~~ Mr. Stoner has
suggested; just a general rationality standard which I suggest
would open up the floodgates to all'sorts of rationalizations
to justify any type of discriminatory plan. . Th@ standard that
w@ believe Congress provided of when feasible not dividing
black population communities would hav® certain administrative
advantages in that the court would not hav© to make the
in-depth sort of inquiry as was don© in Whit© v. •■•.^tegestea:
and so on into some very sticky political and social issues
as to whether blacks ar© better off in a majority or a minority
and fch© like; but rather the administration would be rather
simple.

It would also provide fairly clear guidelines for a

city such as New Orleans when they are attempting to draw a
plan which would not fall afoul of section 5.
It; of course; also leaves this area properly; X
think, in Congress8 hands.

Congress is setting up a limited

remedy; that is limited in time, it's going to expire in
1982; to provide for this particular problem that it found to
exist.

,tod that was the division of black population by

district lines.

Xt also was well aware that this is the way

the Attorney General had been applying that Act when he was

34

dealing with plans submitted to him which involved a question
of line drawing gerrymandering, if you will.
QUESTION:

Do I understand your argument to be that

the obligation of -the city is to so carve and arrange these
districts as to produce the maximum concentrated vote of fch®
minority?
MR. HALPXN:

No, sir.

Our contention is that

section 5 is violated when lines are drawn to divide up black
population concentrations.

Th@ other side of that remedy

would ba in future plans not to so divide up the black
population concentrations.

Now, that's going to have certain

effects which to some extent are going to b© predictable.
For instance, in New Orleans, if you don't divide up those
black concentrations, you ar© likely going to com® out with
two out of five or three out of seven districts.
not what's compelled, that9s just what
to happen.

But that's

in reality is likely

W® don't think it's maximization.

Besides,

wa ar@ not talking about giving any preference at all.

The

likely result would merely be that blacks were no longer
entirely excluded from being a majority in some districts.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Halpin, you have cited at pag© 5 of

your supplemental brief Senator Bayh's statement with
reference t© Richmond.

The sentence that section 5 requires

a redistricting plan in which a comparable portion of the
seats have substantial black majorities,

'does this suggest

35
that on the remand here? that the plan has to fc© on© which
comes up with 39 percent of seven seats?
MR. HALPIN:

Ho.

I think Richmond is what it is,

it has limited its facts as an annexation case ~
QUESTION;

It’s only a Richmond decision.

It

doesn't s©t any general principle which will be applicable
in this caa®?
MR. HALPXN?

Well, I am certainly not asking this

Court to rule that there b© a particular number.
th© standard we are asking for.

That's not

We are asking for a

standard —
QUESTION?

You just want to affirm the standard

that th® three-judge court

MR. HALPXN:

Yes, sir, and I think that standard

could b® elucidated mor© clearly as a c!@ar standard in these
kinds of cases against dividing black concentrations in th©
manner ~
QUESTIONS

The standard goes beyond th® Richmond

standard or the standard that was applied in th© Richmond
case?

As you know, I dissented from it.
MR. HALPXN:

Yes, sir.

Th© standard that we are

suggesting today *—■. ;
QUESTION ?
MR. HALPXNs
all.

Goes beyond.
Mo, X don't think it goes beyond at

It's more narrow if anything.

36
The particular facts of tills ease call for this
Courts if it's going to apply -this standard, fe© affirm th@
district court’s ruling*

If this is in violation of s@ction 5,

it would be very difficult to imagine otm that is, because
in this case the black population has just been divided and
divided rather consistently.

It9s clear that there is a

strong concentration of black population in this city and
this population has bean divided up among many majority whit©
districts.
QUESTION?

Mr. H&lpin, do you think this is an

improvement over what ssxistad before?

And I take it you feel

if it is* it still isn’t enough.
MR. HALPIN:

Over the 1961 redistricting plan?

No, sir, I don't know that that is necessarily relevant, but
in fact it is not, for a number of reasons.

.And the figuras

in the tables might sort of Is:ad you to that conclusion, but
they are misleading because in 1961 only 17 pereant of the
registered voters in New Orleans were black.

In 1973 whan we

war© in district court, something like 38 percent of the
registered voters in the town are black.

So it doesn't make

a whole lot of difference in 1961 as to what happens because
blacks simply weren't allowed to register and vote, but it
does make a difference now that, because of the operation of
other provisions of the Voting Rights Act, blacks have bean
allowed to register and vote in significant numbers and now

37
they are divided up so that they ar© still cut off from the
political process and they still have

no

effective voice in

what the city does»
QUESTION:

Mr, Halpin, did yon say in 1961 Negroes

didn't vot® in New Orleans?
MR. HALPIN:

In 1961, your Honor, 17 parcent''of. th©

electorate —

QUESTION:
MR. HALFIN;
QUESTION:
MR. HALF IN s

But they weren't prevented.
In 1961?
Yes.
There is indeed evidence they were

prevented from registering and voting by literacy tests, other
devices in the Register's office.

There were many suits.

Evidence in th® district court shows that only after the
eff@ct.iv© 1965 Voting Rights Act was there a demonstrable
increase in black registration.
QUESTION;

Mr. Halpin, let me go back wh@r® I was.

Suppo a a the Council were not. under the 10 “year obligation to
redistrict and it just w©nfc ahead and redistxicted hoping
that tjlis was an improvement over what it had a year ago.
Do I Understand, or at leant I think I do, Mr. Wallace's
position anyway, that if the effect still, even though an
improvement, was to diluto voting strength of on© or another
group, it runs afoul of s@cti.on 5.
MR. HALFIN;

Yes, sir, I think that's th® conclusion.

38
I don’t think that’s going to happen,
QUESTION?

Than what would prevent the City Council

frora just sitting flat and doing nothing and letting what was
bad before continue to b© bad?
MR, HALFINs

Well,, assuming that there was no

requirement to redistrict# they could do that.

But that is

seldom the c&s®# and it wasn’t the cas® in this instance.

In

fact# the district court in Louisiana has held ‘that in fact
they ware malapportionad inviolativ© of the one-raan-one-vot@
standard

and it has enjoined them from continuing that plan.

So that’s not the cas© here.
QUESTION?

At least on the assumption I made, good

intentions mean nothing.
MR. HALPIN:
battle# your Honor.

Well# good intentions are half the
Ther© may wall be good intentions# but

intentions are ambiguous sorts of things# but even if the City
Council were with good intentions# if the effect is bad# it
violatos tli© Act.because that’s exactly what the Act says.
QUESTIONs

Even though it's an improvement over

what there was before.
MS. HALPINs

Even if it was in fact an improvement.

But I don’t concedas that that will ever really happen# your
Honor,
Of course# r@adopt.ion of the old in districting
would .amount to another change under section 5# like in

39
Georgia v. United States.

I want to make it very olear that

w® hold that.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Stoner, you have

about 4 minutes left.
REBUTTAL .ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. STONER
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. STONER;
it pleas® the Courts

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
There are two important issues that I

should, like to respond to.

Or.®, there has been a statement

and it appears also in the briefs and appears in the lower
court's decision that the two at-large seats automatically go
to

white population.

And as a basis for this the lower

court refers to the fact that there never has been a black
elected to the City Council of the City of New Orleans.
All rights

I submit that, number on®, there hasn't

been s.n ©lection in th® City of New Orleans since IS69.
Furthermore, th© record clearly shows that blacks have won
©lections to substantial positions in th® City of New Orleans,
and I refer to the election of Judge Moria.'L who was elected
***
to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on a citywide basis in
th® City of'New Orleans.

He is a black.

I refer to Judge

Isi-a©! Augustin© who was elected to th© criminal district
court in the entire city of New Orleans.

He is a black.

I

refer to Dr. Spears who is a black educator and who was elected

40
on a citywide basis to th© New Orleans Parish School Board and
indeed was elected as th® president of that board on a citywide
basis.

In addition to that, since the trial of this case in

the district court, in November 1974, a man by the name of
Edwin J. Lombard, a black, was elected on a citywide basis
to th© clerk of the criminal district court, and he defeated
a whit© incumbent of that office.
Now, I don81 know what better evidence we can bring
before any court to shew that blacks in' the city of New Orleans
can b© elected to office on a citywid® basis.

Of course, it

requires that th® black community nominat® and bring forward
responsible human beings.

When r@spons.ible human beings are

brought; forward, it appears that the city of New Orleans and
th® electorate of the city of New Orleans will in fact elect
them to office.
So we must take issue, and great issue,with th©
statements of th® lower court that blacks cannot b@ elected in
the city of New Orleans when running at large in th© city of
Now. Orleans .

We do not concede that a black cannot be
- *

©lacked to the at-large seats in this case.
QUESTION?

More broadly is what you

are telling us

directed to attacking th® presumption or the hypothesis, th©
premise, of the district court that voters in New Orleans
vote as a bloc racially?
MR. STONER?

The court does allude to that

41
QUESTION?

And you say that experience shows that

as fallacious.
MR. STONER: That8s right.
QUESTION:

The experience over the whole country

deraonstrated that that's a spurious theory with a number of
Negroes sleeted mayors# Congressmen.
MR. STOHBRs

I believe in. the 19703 s that certainly

is the css®# and I submit that this case must be decided on
the facts as they exist in 197 5.

And the undue emphasis ©a

'the fact of the voting situation in Louisiana and New Orleans
years back# years back# has no place in the decision of this
Court.

This case should bo decided on 'the facts as they

exist in 197!».
My second point.

We were looking at maps earlier#

and I would like to call the Court's attention to the map
which appears at page 825.

And I represent to th® Court this

is the proposal that was mad© by th® National Association of
Colored People for th© City of New Orleans.

Now# w© must

agree that they have been a responsible black organisation.
And this is their proposal for th© redistricting of the City
of New Orleans.

You will not© that th© redistricting lines

run north and south.

You will not® that district A and

district B are practically th© same as that in Plan II.

You

will note that the most significant, difference is that til®
Algiers section across the river is connected with section D

42
rather than section C.
district C.

Th© plan submitted puts Algiers with

We submit that this is a reasonable plan, that

Plan 3.1 follows the thinking of the black community at the
time that this plan was adopted.

And we further submit that

we take issue with the east-west idea of redistricting which
runs throughout the briefs of the Government and also of the
interveners«
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:;

Thank you, gentleman.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter war© concluded.]
