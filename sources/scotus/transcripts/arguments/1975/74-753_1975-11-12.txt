ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. RUPP

,

ON

BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. RUPP2
Courts

s

Mr. Chief Justice*

and may it please .the

This case is here on the Government's petition for

writ of certiorari to review the decision by the court of
claims.
Two questions war® presented in -the petition.

First,

whether the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over this case,
and, second, whether in determining the correctness of
respondents' classifications, the Classification Act requires
■that their positions b© compared with positions hold by
employees in another Federal .agency.
The relevant facts are both few and largely
undisputed.

Respondents wore employed as trial attorneys by

the Defens© Supply Agency of the Defense Personnel Support
Canter in Philadelphia.

Their positions are subject to the

Classification Act, and under that Act they were at all
relevant times classified at .

GS-13.
*

On December 9, 1969, they submitted requests to
their employing agency seeking reclassification toGS-14.

In support of those requests, they

4
argue that they ware entitled to reclassification at GS-14
under the general standards promulgated by the Civil Service
Commission, and secondly? that th@ir positions were identical
to positions occupied by attorneys employed by the Mr Force
logistics Command in Dayton, Ohio, positions that war®
classi£i@d one grad© higher than their own.
After an audit by a classifications specialist,
respondents9 employing agency informed them that they were
properly classified at GS-13.

On appeal, the Civil Service

Commission endorsed that conclusion, mad® the same finding
and denied respondents9 request for reclassification.

The

Commission also ruled and Informed respondents that th©
comparisons that they had requested did not constituta a
proper method of classification under th® Classification Act.
Respondents then filed the present suit in th©' Court
of Claims, seeking an order directing their reclassification
to GS-14 as of the date of th® first administrative denial
of their request and bask pay accrued from that date.

Th©

Court of Claims in a 4-to--3 decision ruled that it had
jurisdiction over the case under the Tucker Act

and on th©

merits that the Civil Service Commission had been arbitrary
and capricious in not making th© comparisons that respondents
had requested.

The court therefore remanded th© case to th©

Civil Service Commission with instructions to undertake th©
requested comparisons and to report th® results to the court.

QUESTION?

Do you know, by any chance, whether

there have been many.requests for comparison sine© the Testan
cas® was decided by the Court of Claims
MR. RUPP :

I know of one.

QUESTIONs

Just ones.

MR. RUPPs

I know of on® that resulted in a decision.

There is a'case, I think, decided by the District Court in
.

the District of Columbia,

Schacter,

*

in which the court held

the comparisons were not required, were not appropriate.

X

do not know, and I may have misconceived the question initially,
I do not know whether many such requests hav© been mad®
directly to the Civil Service Commission and then have not
bean pursued after they have been denied.

I do knew that the

Civil Service Commission’s policy is uniformly to dany such
requests.
ha noted in our reply bri©£, the central, and in
our judgment, the dispositive issue-presented by this case
is whether any Federal statute or statutes gives respondents
the substantive right to recover from the United Statens money
damages for the period of'a wrongful civil -Service classifica­
tion,

In assuming jurisdiction in this case, the Court of

Claims conceded, that th® classification process involved
substantial discretion, a concession which I think flows
naturally from this Court’s decision in the; Rams peck case. .
The Court of Claims also' conceded that it was without power to

s
diract respondents' reclassification.

The Court reasoned,

however, that if respondents were found administratively to
b@ entitled to reclassification

,

that determination could

create a right to money damages or right to reclassification
which fch®

Court could then fore© by way of a money judgment .
While I think it is fair to say that th® Court of

Claims dealt at best cryptically with the issue of its
jurisdiction,, the Court appeared to assume first that a
substantive right to th® recovery of money damages against
the United States could appropriately be found by implication
and, second, that th® history of the relationship between the
Federal Government and its employees evidences an intent on
Congress' part to permit th® recovery of money damages for
the period of wrongful Civil Service classification.
Jr

W© submit teat both, of these assumptions which ar©
together essential to holding that the Court of Claims had
jurisdiction ove>,.r this cas® so teat a cause of action was
stated are incorrect.

It is settled, of course, teat the

jurisdiction of th® Court of Claims under the Tucker Act. is
limited to cases in which th© claimants seek actual presently
due money damages, claims founded upon the Constitution, any
Federal statute, at cetera.

To that extent, teen, we acknowledge

teat Congress has waived in th© Tucker Act a portion of the
sovereign immunity, th© historic immunity, of the United
States to suit.

But it is essential, I think, to recognise

7
that, th© Tucker Act does not itself create any substantive
rights to the recovery of money damages from the Uni tad
States. Whether the claimants such as respondents are
entitled to the recovery of money damages depends, in our view,
upon the existence of the statute or combination of statutes,
a substantive provision of some sort in a statuta expressly
and unequivocally waiving the immunity of fch® United States
to the recovery of money damages from fch® public treasury.
It is not sufficient for them purposes, in our
view, nor, indeed, is it ©von relevant, that the existences
of such ® substantive right might be thought responsive to a
particular conception of public policy.

The settled rula

followed in countless cases, many cf which ar® cited in our
main brief at pages 6 through 8, prohibits a Court

from

implying authority to. collect upon the public treasury,which
is precisely what the

Court, of Claims did her© and what

respondents would have them do.
Respondents* contention to the contrary apparently
proceeds from their view of the Tucker Act is constituting.', not
only a grant of jurisdiction to the

Court of Claims over
t

particular types of cases, that is, those involving claims
for money damages, but also is creating substantive rights
to money damages whenever the provisions of any Federal
statute have been violated.
We submit that those ar® separate issues and that

8
they must be analyzed separately.

An examples

In fch®

Federal Tort Claims Act, it's quit® clear -that Congress there
waived a portion of the historic immunity of the United
States t© suit.

It incorporated fch© law of the place and

gave to private parties the substantive right to proceed
against the United States for certain types of tortious
activities.

It did not, however, waive the immunity of the

United States to suits in the Court to such suits in fch© Court
of Claims
Respondents( failure to appreciate the distinction
between substantive rights and a grant of jurisdiction leads
them to a conclusion that would render meaningless the
multitude of Federal statutes in which Congress has expressly
created a right to money damages in particular and clearly
defined circumstances in favor of private parties.

Respondents8

view would render the Back Pay Act certainly superfluous, as
would it render meaningless a number of other statutory
provisions, for example, th® provision in the Equal Employment
Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. 2000(@){5)(G) ~
QUESTXOM;

Of course, if you read the Wickersham

case, Mr. Rupp, you wonder if th© Back Pay Act wasn't
superfluous»
MR. RUPP;

Well, fch® Wickersham case — it's important

to recognise, I think, the context in which th® Wickersham
case teas decided.

Prior to the passage of the Civil Service

3

Act of 1883 , this Court held in several cases that Federal
employees who were discharged or not promoted stated no cause
of action, war® not entitled to judicial redress, notwithstand­
ing tli® caus© or reasons, th© grounds, for their suspension.
QUESTION %
MR. RUPP :

e3 v' e:-,,

which was measurably strengthen by th© Lloyd-La Follette^Act’in
1912, 'this Court, beginning with United Statas v. Wiekersham,
*•

and other Courts recognized that. Congress intended that
Federal employees should not be separated from their positions
wrongfully, that they were entitled to th© privileges and
emoluments of tea position to which they were appointed until
they were lawfully separated.

That’s what those statutes meant,

separation for caus® and not otherwise.
At th® earn® time, however, th© Courts have continued
to recognize that people were not entitled to receive th®
salary of a position to which they have never been appointed.
QUESTION?

But really all th© Back Pay Act doss is

say that if you are wrongfully denied your emoluments, you are
entitled to back pay.

And I thought that was established by

WicSsersham.
MR. RUPP?

Well, to some extent it was.

It

certainly covered some kinds of cases, and maybe the kinds of

10
cases that will arise in the majority kind, of cases e although
the Back Pay Act extended protections to classes of employees
who had not bean theretofore protected by judicial decision.
If you look at the legislative history particularly
of the Back Pay Act amendments passed in 1966, Congress
thought it was filling in the. gaps left by the Back Pay Act
of 1948, which the legislative history indicated was tied to
section 7101 of the Lloyd-LaFollatte Act and judicial decision.
At the time they passed thas® amendments in 1966, they gav#
rather careful consideration to the cost of the coverage
that they were providing for.
How, if the violation of any Federal statute
including th@ classification Act gave rise to a cause of action
for back pay, it would hav® been a wholly futile act t© pass
the Back Pay Act or any number of other Federal statutes.
QUESTION;

Suppose the Civil Service Commission is

in fact paying different wages for the same work.

What is

to® remedy of people such as these respondents?
MR. RUPP:

Well, there are two, X suppos©, or perhaps

more properly stated they are part of the same process.

The

first thing they may do is file a request for reclassification
with their employing agency.

A position classification

specialist is than obligated to look at their positions to
perform an audit of their positions and attempt to determine
whether their positions have been properly classified.

If the

11
decision by the employing agency which draws upon fch® audit
is not satisfactory to the employees , th@y have a right to
appeal to the Civil Service Commission,
QUESTION s

Totally prospective,

MR. RUPPs

Yes.

And I want to make that clear,

Ws are not her® saying simply that these employees are not
entitled to back pay? w© are saying as well that thay ars not
entitled to retroactive reclassification.
QUESTION?

And 'what is the second route?

MR, RUPP;

Wall5 again, it is part of the same rout®.

Once th® employees have exhausted their administrative
remedies, I suppos® that there might b® cases in which they
could file suit in the District Court seeking prospective eguitab!
relief, although 2 don't see any jurisdictional basis for such
i

a suit other than th® Mandamus Act, 28 1361, and I concede
as wall that, th© scope of review on mandamus is restricted.
QUESTION^

Well, certainly, it doesn't cover

discretionary decisions.
MR. RUPP s

No, it does not.

The claim, that —

QUESTION?

Maybe there just is no review,

I mean,

that wouldn't be a terribly earth-shaking —MR, RUPP s

If

you have got a cas® in which the

Civil Service. Commission says for the future we will not
promote anyone with blue ©yes or anyone who is black, I have
little doubt that the District Court would entertain a suit

12
under the Mandamus action and would overturn that determina­
tion *
QUESTIONS

There you would have 1331 jurisdiction.

MR. RUPP:

.Sind 1331, yes, that's right.

In a case in which a decision within the discretion
of tli® employing agency and the Civil Service Commission

under the relevant standards fchos© duties and responsibilities

ORAL ARGUMENT OF . JOHN P. RUPP * ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. RUPP:
Courts

(RESUMED)

Mir. Chief Justice* and may it pleas© the

The principal point of my argument this morning was

that it is inappropriate to imply authority to collect from
the public treasury of the United States.
To complete that discussion* let me now make a
couple of additional points.

The first, is that the principles

that I discussed this morning do not govern Fifth Amendment
taking casos. And tha citation by respondents and the -arctici
in this case to those cases appears to us consequently to have
been misplaced.

The Fifth Amendment by its very terms* as

this.Court recognized in the Railroad Reorganization Act cases*
is a self-executing waiver of sovereign immunity.
mean nothing if it did not mean that.

It would

This Court has recognized

that beginning with the Causby case and' that, view was
reaffirmed in the Railroad Reorganization Act cases.

The

Fifth Amendment is not implicated in this case* and those
cases don’t govern here.
The second and last point I would like to make in
that regard is that neither is this case like Bivens or Bell v.

14
<C*

Hood where the immunity of the United States is not directly
implicated.

The issue in those cases fundamentally is whether

the activities complained of, the basis for the suit in those
cases, were acts of the sovereign with respect to which the
defendants there were entitled to claim sovereign immunity.
Although that issue may not be finally disposed of, it seems
relatively clear that if a person, a Federal employee, is
acting unconstitutionally or beyond the scope of his or her
statutory authority, those allegations are not made here —
QUESTION:

Must the United States be the only

defendant in the Court of Claims?
MR. RUPP:

Yes, this Court has so held.

The importance of the Court of Claims to the Court
of Claims*- assumption of jurisdiction in this case of its
being able to imply a cause of action against the United States
stems precisely from the fact that there is no Federal
statute expressly and unequivocally waiving or implying a
substantive right in favor of individual Federal employees to
collect from the public treasury for the period of an assertedly
wrongful Civil Service classification.

Indeed, the respondents

and the amici have appeared to concede that there is no such
substantive provision explicifc3.y so providing in
Classification Act.

the

In fact, when the scheme provided for in

the Classification Act, the classification process provided
for in that Act, is viewed as a whole, it seems to me apparent

15

that Congress did not intend that classifications would operate
either retroactively or that reclassification might provide
a predicate for the recovery of back pay.

For example, the

Classification Act provides in a number of provisions that the
classification certificates issued by employing agencies in
the first instance and on occasion in the event of review by
the Civil Service Commission are to be binding on payroll,
certifying, and other officials with authority to disburse*
monies from th© public treasury»

There is no provision in the

Classification Act warranting either retroactive

reclassifica­

tion or the award of back pay.
Neither, I should note, is there any suggestion,
however tenuous, in the legislative history of th©
Classification Act supporting the claim mad© by respondents
in this case.

That omission, it seems to me, is particularly

significant in light of the longstanding rule that Federal
employees are entitled to receive only the salaries of the
positions to which they were appointed, notwithstanding the
fact that they nay have performed duties of another higher
paying position,»
Furthermore, although the Classification Act has
been in effect for approximately 50 years, although
significantly amended in 1948, but in its essentials in effect
for ovar 50 years, we have been able to locate only one other
case in which the Court of Claims, or any other Court, w® know

16

of no other Court that has held by implication as the Court
of Claims, did here.

The only other case in which the Court

of Claims appeared to assume in dicta,and again without
reaching the issue that the Classification Act might provide
a warrant for retroactive reclassification or for the award
of back pay,is the case Bookman

United States.

Prior to the

decision in Bookman, th© Court of Claims had consistently and
repeatedly held that Federal employees were only entitled to
the salaries of the positions to which they were appointed.
They so held in cases such as Baehra v. United States, Price -v.
United States, and Coleman v. United Statas, and as recently
as 1968.

None of those cases were cited or discussed in the

Court5s opinion in this case.
In a series of decisions extending over 40 years,
beginning shortly after passage of the Classification Act,
the Comptroller General of the United Statas has taken the
same position, that is, that reclassifications may operate
prospectively only and that Federal employees may not recover
back pay for the period of a wrongful classification.

The

only exception to this general rule that has been recognised
has been for administrative errors attributable to th© failure
of a subordinate to implement a valid classification decision
made by the employing agency or the Civil Service Commission.
QUESTION;

It's not often that the Justice Department

relies on the Comptroller General to support its views.

17
MR. RUPP:

No, that may be true.

Although th© Court of Claims in this case expressly
disclaimed

it's on th© Back Pay Act» ■ Let me make a couple

of points in that regard.
Again, the Back Pay Act does not explicitly provide
for th@ payment of money damages for th® period of a wrongful
classification.

Th© Back Pay Act authorizes the award of back

pay, and let me quote, "to employees subjected to an
unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that has resulted
in the withdrawal or reduction85 of all or part of his
compensation.

That language does not cover the situation

with which w@ have been presented here which does not involve
the withdrawal or the reduction of compensation but an
assertadly wrongly failure to increase compensation.

If

there is any ambiguity in that language, and I think there is
non©, th® legislative history of the Back- Pay Act makes
unmistakably clear that Congress meant that Act to apply only
to wrongful suspensions, demotions, removals, and other
unwarranted and unjustified personnel actions resulting from
reassignments or a transfer from full or part-time work.

Th©

Back Pay Act originally grew out of the Lloyd-La. Follette Act
of 1912 which governed dismissals and suspensions.

As

amended in '1948 the Congress filled a number of gaps in the
— ©xcus® m©, in 1966 — Congress filled in a number of the
gaps in the Act but did not. provide for the recovery of back

i

18

pay for persons wrongfully classified.
Tli© Court of Claims- prior to this case has held as
wall that the Back Pay Act does not provide a predicate for
recovery by employees of back pay for the period of wrongful
classifications.

For it to have ruled otherwise, other than

it did in this case, then, would have required it to overrule
a long line of its own decisions,, including Desmond v, United
States,-----

Dianish
v. United States, c\nd Ganse v. United
States.
----————..........—
...—~~~———
Evan if the substantive right to the recovery of

money damages against the United States for the period of a
wrongful classification could appropriately be found by
implication, and as I have argued this morning and in our
briefs that it cannot be, I think that we believe that the
Court of Claims would no less assuredly have been without
jurisdiction over this case.

We discussed in some detail the

history of the relationship between the Federal Government,
and its employees in our briefs, we discussed it a bit further
thi3 morning.

The fact is that when Congress was considering

tii© Classification Act and the Back Pay Act, the prevailing
rule was that wrongfully classified Civil Service employees
were not entitled to the recovery of back pay.

Congress could

have provided in either the Classification Act or the Back Pay
Act for such recovery.

It did not.

is persuasive evidence

of

It seems to me that that

Congress8 intent not to permit

the recovery of back pay such as that sought by respondents in

19

this cas© in tha circumstances presented in their complaint.
One final point on the jurisdiction or caus® of
action aspect of this case.

That is

the argument mad© by

the amici that our position in this cas® would leave respondents
wholly without remedy for wrongful classifications.

As -their

discussion of the substantive provisions of the Classification
Act reveals, I think, Congress created in the Classification
Act an elaborate set off administrative safeguards to ensure
that the goals off the Act would be met in practice,, including
the goal of equal pay for substantially equal work.
We have also acknowledged that a suit could be
brought in District Court seeking prospective classification,
although tht scop® off that remedy is, off course, a limited on®.
To the extent that persons wrongfully classified or assertedly
wrongfully classified are without back pay for: the period off
that wrongful classification is a matter, in our view, to be
left to Congress.

They have resolved this far not to provide

back pay under the circumstances.
■With respect to the merits of the contention that
the Civil Services Commission was arbitrary and capricious in
refusing to compare respondents5 positions with the positions
held by employees in another Federal agency, let me say only
that that kind of position comparison was very substantially
the kind of classification scheme which Congress rejected in
1923 when it enacted th© Classification Act..

There are

20

insuperable, in our view, practical difficulties associated
with the suggestion that the Civil Service Commission has a
duty to compar® positions under any circumstances.

The Court

of Claims attempted to deal with these difficulties in part
by suggesting that its holding was limited to circumstances
in which the complaining employ©® and fell© employees referred
to had a large nexus of duties performed in common.
QUESTION:

Do w© gat to this •—

MR. RUPP %

NO.

QUESTION %

If we agree with you in your first point,

w© don't reach this —
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

QUESTIONS

But w© would have to if w® didn5fc.

MR. RUPP:

If you would hold that the Court of Claims

had jurisdiction in this case, then we would have to reach
point two.

We believe the case is ovt?r as soon as you haves

looked at jurisdiction.
The entire thrust of the Classification Act is to
require the classification of positions by reference to
generally applicable standards.-

Repeatedly in the Classifica­

tion Act the Civil Service Commission is required to
promulgate generally applicable standards, employing agencies
are obligated to look at those classification standards in
making classifications. In reviewing the appropriateness of
classifications the Civil Service Commission is required again

21

to scrutinise the classification decisions reached by employing
agencies in light of the general classification standards*
On® of the great problems that would be presented
ware the Civil Service Commission to have a duty to perform
comparisons of the type requested by respondent is that
the employing agency in th© first instance would not have
access to th® kind of information that it would need to m&ka
such comparisons.,

You would then have a Classification decision

mad® by an emplc=ying agency not taking into account the full
rang© of considerations mad© appropriate by the’Court of Claims'
decision in this case.

Not only then would Federal Civil

Service employees have th© prospect of two bites at vary
largely the same apple, they would also have the prospect of
review by a body obligated to take into account considerations
that could not have been taken into account by the employing
agency*

We believe that there is a very great likelihood

that that would stimulate appeals in a large number of cases
in which appeals were not warranted,
QUESTIONs

I suppose one of th® considerations, among

many others, would be th© budget, wouldn't it?
MR, RUPP:

Well, yes, that's right,

QUESTION:

If there were a sudden judicial order

somewhere to move all of the class of 13*s to Grad® 15, you
would have quite a problem.
MR. RUPPs

That's a problem.

There is a further

22
problem —
QUESTION?

There are even more important problems

than til® budget,
MR. RUPP :
and

wq

There is the problem that you suggest,

referred to that in our brief,

A related problem is

that the Civil Service Commission could not necessarily assume
that the position pointed to by the complaining employees was
properly classified,

I suppose it %/ould be entitled to prima

facie considerations of proper classification.

But to do the

f,

kind of job that the Court of Claims appears to require in
this case would require the.Civil Service Commission not only
to make th© comparison that had been requested, but to validate
th© classification of th© positions being pointed out.

At

least in theory that's going to double th© work of the Civil
Service Commission.
■ QUESTION?

I didn't mean to interrupt.

If a plaintiff

files a complaint in the Court of Claims and says that the
Back Pay Act and th© Classification Act together give m© a
claim for money damages against the United States and goes on
to detail particulars, the Court of- Claims decides that neither
of those Acts does give a claim for money damages against th®
United States, does th© Court of Claims dismiss for want of
jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim on which relief
can b® granted?
MR. RUPP5

They do both.

23
QUESTION %

I thought they would have to do one or

MR. RUPP5

Well, in theory, of course, they should

the other.

do ona or the other.
QUESTIONS

I don8t mean as a practice, but I mean

what should they do, logically, under your argument?
MR. RUPP %
proposition.

Well, there is support for either

I think fcha proper course would be to dismiss

for failure to state a cause of action, although there is
support for the contrary, particularly given the implications
of sovereign immunity.
QUESTIONS

If jurisdiction isVonly to award monetary

damages even though another court might have jurisdiction
over a cause of action asking for something else,

wouldn't

a proper dismissal be for want of jurisdiction?
MR. RUPP:

Wall ~

QUESTIONs

Perhaps it's not worth pursuing.

MR. RUPP:

It may not be.

I think, Mr. Justice

Blackman's opinion in Gnotta would lead to that conclusion.
think a contrary argument could be mad® with some reasonableness.

It * s without. ‘ significance here.
QUESTION:

That is a determination that there was

no cause of action stated in that court would b® essentially
the same as a jurisdictional determination, wouldn’t it?
MR. RUPP:

That is correct, and they would be

I

conclusion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN J. McDERMOTT
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. McDERMOTT:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

The contentions of the petitioner are that the

respondents ar® correctly classified as GS-13.

Now, the issue

depends upon the Civil Service Commission's general attorney
series and upon the equal-pay-for-equal“work statute.
QUESTION:

You are starting with fchoin second

contention, aren't you?

You will come back to jurisdiction

at some time I hope. .
MR. McDERMOTT:

Well, as far as jurisdiction is

concerned, the Tucker Act gives 'the Court jurisdiction, and we
submit that it absolutely waives sovereign immunity insofar as
it goes.

Now, that providas the Court of Claims jurisdiction

to enter judgment upon any claim against the United States
founded either upon the Constitution, or any act of Congress,
or any regulation of the Executive Department, or upon any
express or implied contract with the United States, or for
liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in
tort .
Now, we submit that our cas© is based upon, on®,
the Classification Act, and also upon the Equal Pay for
Equal Work Act.

A court of three “-and Nichols

They said this case is peculiar in its

Whereas her© employees all belong to a small f@deral.ly

manageable cadre, their jobs have a larg© nexus of duties
shared in common, and other employees were specifically
pointed out by the complaining employees, we rule the case
to be different.
^

Now, the case on which the'Court of Claims depended

.

was th© Salman case , Selman v» United States.

In that case

e

Navy Captains had been assigned Assistant Judge Advocate
Generals of the Navy, and the statute provided that if an
officer was assigned to that position, he was entitled to the
pay of a Rear Admiral lower half,

Nevertheless, he was only

26
paid at the rate of maybe a

Captain' s pay.

Now, whan it came fco the Court of Claims , the Court
of- Claims

ruled that the statute was mandatory and gave them

the pay of a Rear Admiral

lower half for the period of their

service and gave SelmCan back pay for 44 months.
Now, this case, the plaintiffs are trial'attorneys
before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.

Now,

the trial judge pointed out, and he set forth th© position
descriptions of both the plaintiffs, which are under GS-*1,3,
and th® Air Force attorneys which are GS-14, and he said there
is really no difference between the position descriptions.
The duties were th® same, they prepare cases, try cases, file
post hearing briefs, file pretrial: briefs, interview witnesses,
secure expert witnesses.

They do everything -th® same job as

for both of fch@m.o
Now, be said that if you apply the equal pay for
equal work statute and if you look at th© general attorney
series, you come; to th© inescapable conclusion that the
plaintiffs are entitled to be classified as grade GS-14.
QUESTION;

You have to make two jumps, though, to

have the Se3.man case control this case, don't you?

You have

got to show that there is language in either the Back Pay Act
or the Classification Act that is equally mandatory, and you
have got to show that Salman is right in the light of our
decision in the Kane case.

27
MR. McDERMOTT:

Well, Selman

is right because it

was pursuant to a statute which provided for that pay, the pay
of a Rear Admiral lower half for an Assistant Judge Advocate
General,

Xt8s a provision of the statute.
Mow, we say that we are assuming, dependent upon the

provisions of a statute, w@ depend upon the provisions of
the general attorney series, and the trial judge — and h©
studied this case, 1 think, very well

he said this, that

the comparison of the position descriptions of th© DPSC and
the AJ?LG demonstrate that they are strikingly similar, and he
was of the opinion that on© classifier, for instance, out at
Dayton,, would look at the general attorney series and the
position description and come to the conclusion that it was
properly classified as Grade

gs-14,

whereas the position

classifier at the Defense Personnel Support Center

would look

at the same position description, the same general attorney
series and com® to the conclusion it was properly classified
at GS-13.
Nov?, he said that the position descriptions are
almost strikingly similar and the duties of the trial attorneys
are the same.
Also, Mr. Rupp argued that th©' Back Pay Act does not
cover this situation.

Now, in the amicus curiae brief, at

page 16, on line 17 there is an analysis of the Eack Pay Act.
Now, it is submitted that phrase "unjustified or unwarranted

28
personnel action” within the meaning of fch© Back Pay Act
applies as well to this action wrongly classifying the
plaintiffs in this case

as it would as if it were a removal

or a reduction in rank or a suspension.

And it's pointed out

that the Congress left that phrase almost open for interpretation and that the Civil Service Commission did the same thing,
and that there is no statement in any of the congressional
hearings or reports defining what is meant by unjustified or
unwarranted personnel action.

And that's merely a question

of interpretation of the statute and we submit that on that
basis we are entitled to recover.
Now, so far as jurisdiction is concerned, w© depend
on three things

one, th© general attorney series,and the

trial judge has found that they are entitled to Grade GS-14
thereunder.

There ar© only two factors that wore concerned

there, and he went into them quite thoroughly in his opinion.
Now, actually, if you look at this case, and you
look at the Sel«*an case, and in Selman the court said that
they are entitled to the pay of a Rear Admiral lower half
because the statute so provided.

We say that we ar© entitled

to th© grad© of GS-14 because the general attorney series so
provided and the equal pay for equal work statute so provides.
Now, actually, if you com® down to th© position of
th® Civil Service Commission, that says that w© disregard the
statute which says equal pay for equal work and we look at the

29
position description of the person only under the series which
is applicable to it.

Now# the Court of Claims and the trial

judge ruled that that was improper and arbitrary arid capricious
because the Commission actually refused to follow a
congressional mandate of equal pay for equal work, and there
I’’

are many cases in the Court of Claims where -that provision
has been established and enforced.
Now , w® submit also that th® trial judge found that
there is discrimination in this case, and h© specifically found
that in his opinion where he said, 85On th© evidence in this
case, it is concluded that the refusal to classify plaintiffs
to GS-14 is arbitrary, discriminatory, and is not supported
by substantial evidence. "
Now, if there be discrimination in this case, than
we cite th© decision of the Court of Claims in Chambers v.
United States.

That ruled that a black applicant for a

position in the Social. Security Administration who had been
discriminated against was entitled to back pay.

Novi, that's

a very well-written opinion by Judge Nichols, and I suggest
if

that opinion be followed and the fact of discrimination

be found to have been adopted by the trial judge as a finding
based upon his review of the record, then I suggest that we
are entitled to relief.
Now, actually, if you look at what's referred to as
th® remand stature, all that the Court of Claims has done here

30
has been to follow it.

They found that the Civil Service

Commission’s action was arbitrary and capricious and that the
Commission should comply with the mandat® of the statute
calling for equal pay for equal work.

And the

Court of

Claims ruled that the grades of other lawyers representing
other procuring agencies before the Armed Services Board of
Contract Appeals provide an essential bench mark and without
consideration of them,, no confidence could be felt that the
statuta calling for equal pay for equal work had been obeyed.
How, the statuta, that's 92-415, -that's what's
referred to in Mr. Rupp's brief as the remand statute,
provides that in any casta within this jurisdiction, the Court of
Claims shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to
any administrative or executive body or official with such
direction as it may deem proper»

And the Senate report

pointed out that the Act providas the United States Court of
Claims with the necessary means to compel administrative or
executive bodies to take further action where it is necessary
to make an adequate record.
Now, that's all that the Court of Claims has don®
here.

It said it

f disagrees with the trial judge that the

Court has the right to reclassify people, that that's a job
for the Civil Service Commission, and it remanded it back to
th® Civil Service Commission to take into consideration the
equal~pay-for~egual“"Work statute and to find if plaintiff® ,

31
using as a bench mark the grade applied to the trial attorneys
from the Air Force at Dayton,to determine whether or not they
were entitled to a Grade GS-14.

And that8 s all -that the

remand statute does.
So wo ask the Court in consideration .of this case
to find, first of all,, that th© Court of Claims had jurisdic­
tion to consider this, that it’s never necessary for a statute
to itself provide that for breach of it a person shall have
an action against -the United States because that's what th®
Tucker Act does.

The Tucker Act gives jurisdiction to th®

Court of Claims , and there are many statutes and regulations
the breach of which do not spell out th© right to sue in th©
Qourt of Claims for damages.

So w@ submit that there is, first:

of all, there is jurisdiction, and that it is a good thing
for the practice of law generally to raise the grades of lawyers
who appear before th© Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.
Now, w© have a letter from the Chairman of the
Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in which he says
that generally most of the lawyers who appear before them are
Grade GS-14,

Th® only exception appears to be the trial

attorneys for th® Defense Personnel Support Center.

And when

they do the same work that other lawyers do before th® Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals, then I submit they are
entitled to the same pay, because it's equal pay
work.

for equal

That's a statutory definition and mandate, and I submit

32
that the Court of Claims8 judgment should bs affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you* genfcieraen.

The cas© is submitted.

above-entitled matter were concluded.]
