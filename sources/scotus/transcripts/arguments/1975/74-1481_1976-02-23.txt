P ROCEEDINGS
mr.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Wo will hoar arguments

next in No. 74-1481, American Mororists Insurance Company
against Virgil B, Starnes.
*ir. Westbrook, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
SEAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL W. WESTBROOK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. WESTBROOK:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
I am Joel Westbrook of San Antonio, Texas
representing the Appellant, .American Motorist.
We are aware, may it please the Court, that not
very many constitutional venue questions come to this
Court but I must nay, I must pass on to you that it has
been said that Texas probably has, within its own Appellate
system, more venue appeals than all the other 49 jurisdic­
tions combined and I believe this case will help you to
see v/hy that is. because in Texas the venue carries a
great deal more encumbrance than just whore the case is
going to be tried.
Our client, the American Motorist, unsuccessfully
challenged venue in this uninsured motorist case as brought
aeainst it in a Texas State District Court in McLennan
County, Texas.

4
The Appellant then had no more success in the
Appellate courts of Texas because the Texas Supreme Court
had previously, in 1963 in its Commercial Insurance versus
Adams case,, against virtually the same constitutional
challenge, hold against the challenge virtually the same
one that we are making today.
QUESTION:

That was a Texas Supreme Court case,

wasn't it?
MR. WESTBROOK:

Yes.

Actually, your Honor,

the Texas procedure of refusing writ of error and choosing
between two conflicting courts of civil appeals judgments
on this point and in per curiam selecting one of them and
when writ is refused in Texas outright, why, that is the
same precedential value as a Texas Supreme Court case
would have.
QUESTION:

Is it possible to .say that your

opponent doesn’t rely on Adams?

He doesn’t cite it in his

brief.
MR. WESTBROOK:

Your Honor, I felt that the

Court would --QUESTION:

Maybe I should ask him that.

MR. WESTBROOK: Yes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Westbrook —

MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

--- I take it that this same Plaintiff

15

could have sued a domestic corporation in McLennan

County

just as you were sued in McLennan County since this
plaintiff resided in McLennan County so that the only
distinction you claim is beinq made between in-state and
out-of-state corporations is the necessity with respect to
a domestic corporation of having to prove a prima fascic
case as a cause of action.
MR. WESTBROOK:

Actually* having to prove a

case by a preponderance of the evidence* your Honorc yas.
That is the difference.
OUHSTTO^-

Do you think this is a final judgment

MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTIO?!:

X beg your pardon?

Do you think this is a final judgment

under R-20 and U.S. v. Lnndo?
MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION.:

Yes, sir* it is a final judgment

If you are thinking about our i*anQ0

case* where it held that

whexa Congress conferred a

right of — limited the right to sue a federal bank*

it

would strike me that your claim here -- you are not
claiming a right that Texas law gives you to be sued in
a particular county.

All you are really claiming is the

right to be treated identically with the domestic
corporation* isn’t it?
MR. WESTBROOK:
QUEST ION;

Yes* sir* that is correct.

Do you think that is the same as

6
Lando, for finality purposes?
:m. WESTBROOK:

I do not have the familiarity

with Lnngde on that point, your Honor but in our juris­
dictional statement, the Appendix B-III, we cite a number
of cases, which are Texan cases, of course, that do hold
that they arc final judgments and they are appealable in
Texas and this Court did note probable jurisdiction before
in another Texas case, Exxon, versus Preston and it had been
briefed by the Appellant»
QUESTION:

But all the Texas Court here did was

to say that the suit could proceed against your company.
The suit isn't over.
MR. '.JESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

That i-» right, yes, sir.

Maybe you are suggesting that we

should have postponed jurisdiction, rather than noted it.
MR. ','SSTBTIOOK:

Well, sir, I can only say that

in Preston versus Exxon, -jurisdiction was noted.

Wasn't it mooted out?

Let me follow

through with another question Mr. Justice "Rehnquis t
intimated.

Would you explain for us just what a preliminary

venue hearing amounts to in Texas as far as a domestic
corporation is concerned?

‘in.

NEhTBROOT:

Yes, sir.

If you have a

(tones tic on mgr at ion in Texas that challenges venue where

7
the plaintiff has brought the action, that domestic
corporation,

the defendant, files what is called a plea of

orivilo^e, a verified plea.
The Plaintiff then files what is called a
"controverting’ plea" and it is sent down for hearing.

If it is sustained, then the case is transferred .in our case, to Dallas County, where the principal office

was of American Motorist — it is transferred -bo that
county unless there is an appeal from that order.
If it is overruled, it is then tried in the
county in which it was originally brought unless there is
an appeal from that order but either side can appeal the
ruling of the

trial court.

QUESTION;

Well, do you feel that that affords

unequal protection as between domestic and foreign
corpora tions'?

8

MR. WESTBROOK:

In this rasp-act* that when the

domestic corporation makes its challenge to the venue, the
plaintiff, in order to

keep that case in that county,

McLennan County, has to prove, in addition to other factors
such as the residence there or there is an agent of that
domestic corporation resident in McLennan County —* ha has
to prove his cause of action, every constituent element*
has to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.
This is a vary substantial burden that the
Plaintiff has to bear at this early stage in the proceedings.
QUESTION:

And you are saying that ha doesn’t

have to bear that with respect to a force operation, there­
fore, no equal protection.
MR. WESTBROOK:

That is right, your Honor.

He --

in our case, we stipulated and the thing was tried on the
record, stipulated facts.

We stipulated

American Motorist

was an Illinois corporation authorised to do business in
Texas and doing business in Texas and that it had an agent
in McLennan County.

That is what it is and the Plaintiff

relied on Subdivision 27 of our general venue statute and
that was sufficient under subdivision 27.
Had it been a domestic corporation, it would not
have bean sufficient.

We would then have had to go ahead

and prove the cause of action.
QUESTION :

I hear what you say, but does it mean

9
you have a full dress trial before a jury on the merits» on
the venue issue alone?
MR. WESTBROOK:

If yon ask for a jury, yes.

But

as I said, the court has the discretion to try the case on
the merits at the same time it tries plea of privilege, if
he does ask for a jury.
QUESTION:

But if the court does not exercise thcit

discretion, then the plaintiff has the burden of showing
by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to
recover on the merits?
MR. WESTBROOK:

Yes, sir.

Every element of

the cause of action except damages -- factual damage.
QUESTION:

And so you might have a week's trial?

MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

But if you are a

foreign corporation

you don't have that opportunity.
MR, WESTBROOK:

No, sir, just if you are a

foreign corporation doing business and have an agent in
that county.
QUESTION:

And does the defendant put in. evidence

at the jury trial to controvert the evidence introduced by
the plaintiff?
MR. WESTSRGOKs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So you have a full-dress trial?

MR. WESTBROOK:

Could be, yes, sir.

And, of

10
course, the —QUESTION:

What is the normal practice?

Does

the judge usually have two trials or does he usually
consolidate?
HR. WESTBROOK:

No, sir, the normal practice, I

would say, is a jury is not demanded.

The normal practice

is that the judge hears and makes the decision and normally,
it is not a full-dress trial.
QUESTION:

Normally, what is it, sort of a prima

fascie case and just hears the plaintiff?
MR. WESTBROOK:
that.

No, sir, it has to go beyond

In our trials court, he has to prove it by the

preponderance of the evidence but of course, if a judge
in the finder cf facts in this kind of preponderance
business, it is not likely to be upset that it was the
preponderance of the evidence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Westbrook, I see from the brief

that you filed,the Appendix here, that there are 31 sections
to the Texas venue code.

There are obviously distinctions

between foreign corporations and domestic corporations
which you are asking us to focus on but under section 28,
if your company had been a fire, marine or inland insurance
comapny which had been subject to different regulations,
then being an automobile Casualty company.
Nov, what is the standard that we are supposed to

11
apply in terms of equal protection in determining whether
these 31 different provisions for venue and different kinds
of suits offend the Federal Constitution?
MR. WESTBROOK;

We say that the Federal

%
Constitution is offended — the Equal Protection Clause —
by reason of the difference in Subdivision 23 which covers
domestic corporations and Subdivision 27, which covers
foreign corporations other than those specified elsewhere
and this case came up under Subdivision 27.
Mo other of the subdivisions are involved.
QUESTIONt

That is true.

It is perfectly true,,

but it seems to be that any litigant in Texas, unless he
happens to be a private individual sued in a particular
kivnd of case, is going to be able to make some claim that
he is treated differently than a railroad personal injury
case in Section 25 of the fire and marine case in 28.
What standard do we apply?
MR. WESTBROOK:

Yes, sir, as a matter of fact,
-

n'

■

Subdivision 23 'was before this Court 44 years ago on the
claim that corporations were discriminated against because
they had to prove a cause of action and the individual did
i

not in order to avail himself of the privilege of transfer
to the county of his residence and the standard, we think,
is the standard that was employed, substantially employed
in Power Manufacturing versus Saunders, which this Court

12
decided in 1927 involving an Arkansas venue statute and that,
in that case, the Arkansas statute permitted a foreign
corporation to be sued anywhere in the state, any county
in the

state, whereas domestic corporations were limited to

places where they had an agency or representative and this
Court, in that Saunders case, said that the classification
was not a reasonable classification»

There were not any

facts related to the classification which reasonably could
justify it.

It was arbitrary.

QUESTION;

Your case isn't power, is it, because

Texas refers even to a foreign corporation as if he is
sued only in a county where it has an agent.
MR. WESTBROOK:

Of course, as agent or its

principal place of business or in the county where the
cause of action arose.
In this particular case, the cause of action
arose in Tarrant County.

American Motorists has its home

office in Texas in Dallas County and the Plaintiff sued in
McLennan County, the county of his residence.
QUESTION:

And he could have sued a domestic

corporation.
MR. WESTBROOK:
domestic corporation.

Yes, he could have sued a

It is ~~ the Arkansas statute in

Saunders, we recognize that had a wider venue play than
here.

Ours is deeper because this matter of the burden

13
that a plaintiff against a domestic corporation has is a
valuable right.

Our courts have consistently said, this

is a valuable right, this venue right and part of the
reason is, I think you can readily

see,, is that if you are

a domestic corporation, you get these things:
One, you get a look at your adversary's tactic,
witnesses.

You get, at the very least, a judicial

appraisal of the value of the case fz-orn an evidentiary
point of view and you get an appellate appraisal, perhaps
as to the important

procedural evidentiary matters.

It

is a very valuable thing that these domestic corporations
have and we do not believe that there is any rational
justification for having the difference between domestic
corporations’ right to be transferred to the county of
their residence and foreign corporations.
QUY9TI9N:

Now —

You arc saying — of course you are

saying that it is irrational to say a domestic corporation
should be sued either, (A), where the event took place or,
(B), at its home base when a foreign corporation is likely
to have a more pervasive presence in a state, is it not?
MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Ye S', sir, substantially so.

Then isn't there a rational basis

for the different treatment?
MR. WESTBROOK:
I beg your pardon, sir?

*

The domestic corporation —

14
QUESTION:

Isn't that a rational basis fox- a

differant treatment of the two?
rift. WESTBROOK:

Your Honor, I do not believe

that the sole fact — and this is what was
in the

held, I think,

in Saunders, if the sole reason for discriminating

under the venue statutes is residence, if that is the sole
reason, that that is not sufficient to avoid a confrontation
with the Equal Protection Clause.
As a matter of fact, I think an argument could be
made for the proposition, looking for legislative intent,
that the Texas legislature may not have even intended this
result.
What happened was, before "43 they were treated
alike.

Then, in 1943, the legislation amended Subdivision

23 and created this requirement that the cause of action
be proven against them but it did not similarly amend
Subdivision 27 so you are not getting the same justice in
the procedure of defending, an insurance company defending
if you are a foreign corporation that you would get if you
were a domestic corporation.
\

QUESTION:

Mr. Westbrook, if I may interrupt you

for just a minute, is this the requirement •— when the suit
if: against a domor-tic corporation, the requirement is that
he put in his prima fascia case and a little more.

Is that

in the statute or is that by judicial interpretations?

15
MR. WESTBROOK;

No, sir, that is by judicial

interpretations in the statute ‘to the extent that it says,
"cause of action" but establishing that it must prove a
cause of action by preponderance of the evidence, it is by
judicial interpretation.
QUESTION:

Your objection is to the way in which

the Texas courts have construed Section 23.
Has any plaintiff ever made the contention in a
suit against the domestic corporation that this is an
unconstitutional burden against him because ha has a
greater burden than if he sued a foreign corporation?
MR. WESTBROOK;
QUESTION;

Your Honor, I do not believe so.

It seems to ma that its a greater

burden on the plaintiff who has to do it than on anyone
else.
MR. WESTBROOK;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Yet you are the one who is really most

excited about it.
QUESTION:

Before you carry on —

MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What is the justification for what,

in effect, is a minitrial on a plea of privilege where the
only issue is venue?

What is the rationale?

What prompted

the Texas courts to construe Section 23 in this fashion?
MR. WESTBROOK:

1 think partly — and of course,

16
this was before summary judgment, but I think that there
are distinctions still
cases in the bud.

this partly was to nip frivolous

If you couldn’t show a cause of action

right there at the beginning to the satisfaction of the
court or a jury, then you would avoid a long trial because if
it was transferred to another county under that disability,
the odds are pretty good it is not going to be tried.
QUESTION:

Do you now have summary judgment

practice in Texas?
HP. WESTBROOK:

We do have summary judgment

practice.
QUESTION:

That is the plan of this curious

procedure?
MR. WESTBROOK:

Mo, sir.

And I think the reason

why not and why wo still have so much of this is that you
get some things in plea of privilege that you don’t get —
I’m talking about from the defense point of view •—
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WESTBROOK:
judgment.

— that you don’t get in summary

As your Honor knows, in Texas and

most states,

you can beat a summary judgment motion by the Defendant
just by showing there is an issue of fact but you can’t
beat a plea of privilege that way.

You have to prove up

your case.
QUESTION:

You have to shew a preponderance of

17
the evidence *
MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Mr. Westbrook?

MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's right.

Yes?

Your minitrial, or whatever you want

to call it, occurs in your plea of privilege cases only
where the statute speaks of the cause of action having
arisen in a particular place, doesn't it?
MR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

In other words, when the venue

provision doesn't depend on where the cause of action
arose, then there is no minitrial.
MR. WESTBROOK:

That is right.

It is conceivable

that you could have venue — venue exception established
without proving up a court of' action, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Really, though, didn’t the Texas

Supreme Court just come along and read this language,
"where the cause of action arose" and s&y that you, in
effect, if you are depending in that kind of language in a
\»enue statute, you had to show that a cause of action did
arise?
MR. WESTBROOK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, 1 don't

know that that was the language but I could say that that
is the fair effect of it, yes, sir.
QUESTION;

What are you asking the Court to do?

18

Are you asking the Court to send it back and
require the Plaintiffs, in order to support venue, to prove
a prima fascia case?
MR. WESTBROOK:

No, sir.

We are asking this

Court to declare that subdivision 27, as it applied in
Texas, is unconstitutional because it deprives foreign
corporations of the equal protection of the law.
QUESTION:

To declare that unconstitutional

then what happens to this lawsuit?
QUESTION:
venue at all.

Then you would get to change the

Then you couldn’t attack it at all* if you

wipe 27 off the books.
What would you do if you wiped 27 off the books?
MR, WESTBROOK:
more difficult problems

Your Honor, I have had, X suppose,
than that, but we would be happy

with it if you did.
QUESTION:

Yes, but what happens to this lawsuit?

MR. WESTBROOK:

This causa?

Mr, Justice Keith

wrote an opinion when this Court sent beck Exxon versus
Preston after the plaintiff withdrew his brief, to determine
whether or not the cause was moot and I think if this
Court declares Subdivision 27 is unconstitutional, that it
might well have the superior option of sending it back for
determination by the Court of Civil Appeals,

whether

the cause is moot or what further proceedings should be had.

19

I think that is Texas' problem as to what to do with it.
QUESTION:
hasn't run.

Well, the statute of limitations

Could your client then be sued in Dallas?

NR. WESTBROOK:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, the question of —

Is that possible?

MR. WESTBROOK:

I think the statute of limitations

on uninsured motorist cases is probably four years.

I am

not sure because of the contract.
QUESTION:

Well, I suggest, if there is not any

statute of limitations problem, could a new suit

if you

were to prevail here and 27 was struck down, could a nev;
suit be brought in Dallas against your client?
•r\ WESTBROOK:

Well, it could be brought in

Dallas or it could be brought in Tarrant County, the forum
where the —
QUESTION:

Where the cause of action arose.

NR. WESTBROOK:

Where the cause of action arose,

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't be content with a mere

transfer?
MR. WESTBROOK:

I'm sorry, your Honor, I didn't

hear you.
QUESTION:

You would not be content with a mere

transfer of the case to Dallas or Tarrant County?
MR. 'WESTBROOK:

I think mechanistically I would

20

have to say yes, but, of course, we are hopeful that that
invidious discrimination v/ill be declared unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Well, what you want is the advantage

of the statute of limitations,, though.
MR. WESTBROOK:

Yes, sir.

I think that we should make it clear to the
Court because I don't see how this question was missed but
I think we should make it clear to the Court that we are
talking about corporations that are authorized to do busi­
ness in Texas, not unauthorized.

That would be

an

entirely different story, I think and they do have a
fixed place of business in Texas and do have a designated
process agent.
Mow, in the Saunders case, this Court decided in
1927, held that for

venue purposes, there is just no

constitutional basis for distinguishing between a domestic
and an authorized foreign corporation.
X don't know what my time situation is except
X v/ill be advised here but 1 believe that it would probably
be» appropriate if I let my distinguished associate from
Waco answer the next set of questions but before I do, let
me say this:
f — if you will pardon the personal reference —
am of a family of six generations in Texas and I really feel
that I am on sound arounds in saying that this invidious

21
discrimination is something more than just being inhospi­
table to foreign corporations.

If is regrettably so but it

is more than that.
We think it does what Mr. Justice Brennan was
talking about in Bowers, I believe, when he spoke of* the
disruption of federalism and we think this kind of
discrimination is disruptive of federalism.
At the Army-Navy Club, you know, they changed the
name

of the

room, the Strangers' Room, they changed to

the Visitors’ Room and that is somewhat more hospitable.
But we do believe if is not just % question of
hospitality, that it is disruptive of federal —
QUESTION:

It is still the same room at the

Army-Navy' Club, though,
MR. NESTBROOK:
mw.

Yes, it is, sir.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr . Dunnam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. V. DUNNAM, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. DUNNAM:

If it please the Court, I'd like to,

in view of the fact that apparently the Justices are not
too familiar

with the localised plea of privilege of

venue practiced in Texas, to give you actually a clearer
Viewpoint on what it actually is about, there.
t

In this stuff about a jury trial, the 21 years
that I have practiced, just continuous trial practice over

22
the years, I have yet for the first time ever tried the
plea of privilege before a jury and actually, I have yet to
hear of one over being tried, though there are instances
during the history of the state where it has occurred»
QUESTION:

IIow many are there — there are, what,

over two hundred counties in Texas?
MR» DUNNAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»
And so it is at least possible the

practice might vary from time to time.
MR. DUNNAM:

Well, if the lawyer or defendant

demanded a jury trial, then the court would put in the
trial on the merits at the same time and for that reason,
they never demand a jury trial because then you just try
the whole case and he wouldn't get his plea of privilege
trial.
QUESTION:
MR. DUNNAM:

Can either party demand a jury trial?
Yes, either party could demand it

but —
QUESTION:
MR. DUNNAMs

I mean, on the plea of privilege?
I don't believe either party can.

It's just the defendant.

It is something that has been

twenty years since they have even heard the question of
the jury trial brought up in the thing.
Now, about the burden of proof, which Justice
Stewart suggested possibly was a prima facie case? now,

23
technically, leoally, according to decisions, it is
preponderance of the evidence as a matter of actual truth
and fact and then, in factual analysis, it was simply a
matter of prima facie proof.
Actually, the way the practice goes, a man makes
out a prima facie case.

He doesn’t show anything other

than a prima facie case.

The trial judge -- I have never

known of one to cite it just on weighing the evidence
and actual facts.

If he makes out a prima facie case, the

plea of privilege is overruled.
That was the law for many, many years in the
State of Texas and then they changed it to preponderance
of the evidence and of course, trial courts being jealous
of their own jurisdiction, your Honor, if a man files a
case in this Court, if he shows that there was a collision
and hie client sa/a the light was green for him, the other
the defendant takes the stand, which they never do.

The

defendant never puts any evidence on a plea of privilege.
It is only a rare instance, I don’t believe in
my 27 years I have ever had it happen.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather there is no finding by

the judge of liability.

What did he do? Ha simply says,

finding is part of your burden?
MR. DytlNAM:
QUESTION:

If venue is established.

Now —

All right, he makes no finding —

24
MR. DUNN AM:
QUESTION:

No.

No, your Honor.

—- and they have got a case of

liability.
MR. DUNNAM:
presence.

He just overrules the clear

Now, Mr. Justice Relinquish brought up a question

about whether or not the — and Mr. Westbrook responded that
the purpose of this, the whole clear privilege, the back­
ground purpose and objective of the state legislature in
this instance is to give our defendant an opportunity to
see what the cause of action is, throw out frivolous law­
suits .
Of course, that has no bearing on it whatsoever
as to the purpose of the legislature for the reason that
Justice Rohnquist pointed out, probably 50 percent of
your grounds, your exceptions to exclusive venue in the
county of one's residence are based — have no relationship
to cause of action.
In other words, any suit involving the title to
real estate or remove a cloud of a title, if that is the
suit by its pleadings alone, that is the suit.
foil don’t have to establish a cause of action
whatsoever.

The cause of action has no bearing on it.

If I sue John Doe for running over my dog, to sue him, all
I have to do

he files a plea of privilege.

All I have

to do is come in and prove that he- lives in the county

25
where the suit is.

The cause of action has nothing to do

with it whatsoever.

All 1 have to do is to establish that

that was the county of his residence and in regard to a

QUESTION:

Why not allow both to have the mini-

MR. DUNNAM:

Well, we don't allow the domestic

corporation to have the minitrial on the cause of action.
Where we allege its

primary office is Dallas County,

v/e sue than in Dallas County -- the primary office in fact.
All we have to do is prove its primary office is in
Dallas County.
All right, aS to a domestic, it has no primary
office generally so, the nearest thing to it is is to just
prove that it has a fixed, permanent agency in that county.
That is what a foreign corporation will have in place of
its primary voting office and so forrth, and officers, a
fixed, permanent place of business and we prove that, not
just that it has some agent living down there but it has a
fixed agency with a permanent nature in that county.
Then we have established it.

There is no minitrial

41
required as to then.

There is no mini.trial required as to

tho domestic corporation as to cause of action as to that.
That is our position.
These are the two correlatives.

In other words,

ho has tried to take this other additional ground of venue
which, the domestic corporation, as His Honor, Justice
Stewart, pointed out of course, awhile ago, the domestic
corporation in this additional ground over here he is
talking about, where you have to prove cause of action,
that is an additional ground to hold a domestic corporation
about where it — in addition to these deals, it goes on
and provides that you can hold a domestic corporation where
the plaintiff resides and it holds that you have to hold -to hold a foreign corporation where the plaintiff resides,
you also have to prove that the cause of action .occurred
where the plaintiff resided or the cause of action — you
can hold it in the nearest county to which he has an agent

and as long as they restrict it to the domestic, there is
no way 1 can think

only way you could equivalently treat them.

where its principal place of business is and that a domestic
corporation likewise, then provide the foreign could be sued
where it had an actual permanent, fixed place of business
in Texas, then you would be treating the domestic corpora­

DUNNAM:

You could hold either one of them

where a cause of action occurred

and you .could hold either

one of them where the plaintiff resides plus you have got
to prove a little more on the foreign.

noted.
MB. MESTBROOK:

Probable jurisdiction was noted.

Appellate filed his brief and I don’t think the juris*dictional question was briefed beyond what it just
ordinarily is.

QUESTION:

Perhaps not, no.

NR. WESTBROOK:
^

And then the plaintiff withdrew.

I hove forgotten the exact language that he used.

And

this Court then sent it back to the courts of appeals in
Texas for a determination of whether or not it was moot.
That court determined it was moot and transferred it to
Harris County from Beaumont, where it was originally filed.
QUESTION:

It transferred it, then.

It didn’t

dismiss it.
HR. WESTBROOK:

Mo, sir, it didn't dismiss it,

Nr. Justice Keith in that case, after he got it
back, struggled with that problem

)

opinion on it.

quite a bit, wrote an

It was a problem for him, but that is what

he did.
Me feel that since Waeeling

versus Glander came

after Saunders — Power versus Saunders and after Bain
Peanut, which expressed the philosophy of Mr. Justice
Holmes, who had previously dissented, and that case, by the
way, the Pain Peanut case, which came after Saunders, I
don’t believe Mr, Justice Holmes discussed Saunders at all
in that opinion.

But Wheeling

came still further and while it was

not a venue case, I think it has a very considerable
philosophical core and that is the statement that is made
an there that once a foreign corporation has come into a

50

state and has become domesticated — and let me say that
this insurance corporation comes fully under the insurance
code just as all other insurance companies,, domestic or
foreign in Texas, but once a state has chosen to domestic
foreign cornoraticns •— this is in Wheeling versus Glander,
571 of 337 U. S. — the adopted corporations are entitled to
equal protection with the state's own corporate progeny
and this was a tax case and they said, at least to the
extent of having the same tax basis.
But we believe the basic philosophy of that
statement dees govern.
QUESTION:

Mr. Westbrook, you talked about the

possibility of filing a written document directed to the
issue of our jurisdiction.

Do you have any views on it

orally beyond those you have given us?
Have you thought about it since you came here?
MB. WESTBROOK:

I could not give a helpful

argument on that, your 5'ionor.
QUESTION:

You haven't —

MR. WESTBROOK:

I can refer to Texas cases on its

being a final judgment for purposes of appeal but I do not
have in mind the Supreme Court cases of the United States.
QUESTION:

I’d be interested in this.

MR, WESTBROOK:
we x/ill undertake —

If the Court will grant us leave,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

How much time do

you want, Mr. Westbrook,, a week?
