CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

versus Jose Padilla.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

10

Mr. Clement.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Unlike the Hamdi case, which raised not

11

only the question of the President's and the

12

military's authority to detain, but also questions

13

the process and access to counsel.

14

only two relatively discrete questions, first,

15

whether the habeas petition in this case, challenging

16

Padilla's present physical confinement in South

17

Carolina, was properly filed in Manhattan, rather

18

than against the immediate custodian in South

19

Carolina, and second, whether the President has the

20

authority to detain a citizen who travels abroad,

21

affiliates and associates with the enemy abroad,

22

receives training in enemy camps in wiring and

23

explosives and then returns to the United States at

24

the direction of the enemy to commit hostile and

25

warlike acts.

This case raises

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, there are many aspects of this case

2

that raise issues that are really extraordinary, but

3

the habeas petition that was filed in this case was a

4

standard, indeed ordinary, use of the writ to

5

challenge the prisoner's present physical confinement

6

and the habeas rules are settled that when the writ

7

is used to challenge the present physical

8

confinement, the proper custodian, the proper

9

respondent, is the immediate custodian and the suit

10

should be filed in the district where that custodian

11

is present.

12

In other words, in a case to your present

13

physical confinement, the case should be filed in the

14

district of confinement.

15

QUESTION:

May I ask you on that point,

16

Mr. Clement, supposing this petition had been filed

17

while he was still in New York, and then he was

18

removed to South Carolina.

19

okay, then?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Would the petition be

There would be jurisdiction

21

in that case, Justice Stevens, under the Endo

22

decision.

23

still be a question, especially if there was the, the

24

habeas petition was filed and he was immediately

25

removed, there would still be the question of venue

Now, I think in that case, there would

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

at that point and there is a Seventh Circuit case

2

that's not in the briefs but Ross against Mebane that

3

you may want to look at that says that in a case like

4

that presumptively --

5
6

QUESTION:

I'm not quite sure what your

answer is to my question.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, my answer is

8

jurisdiction yes, under this Court's decision in

9

Endo.

10

QUESTION: I see.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

But then there would still

12

be a subsidiary question that's not raised here about

13

venue.

14

QUESTION:

Which the government would

15

presumably would be free to raise.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17

Exactly, and we would raise

in the case where there was in fact jurisdiction.

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

But in this case our

20

position is there is no jurisdiction whatsoever, and

21

I think that --

22

QUESTION:

Jurisdiction under the Habeas

23

Statutes has been a bit of a confusion because, for

24

instance, on behalf of aliens, I think we have

25

allowed jurisdiction to be obtained in the manner it

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

was here, have we not?

2

MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't think so, Justice

3

O'Connor.

4

but I'm aware of no case of this Court that takes the

5

unprecedented step that the court below took, which

6

is basically to allow a habeas petition to go forward

7

in a case where neither the prisoner nor the

8

custodian is in the jurisdiction where the habeas

9

petition is filed.

10
11

I don't know which case have you in mind,

QUESTION:

What do you do with ex parte

Endo?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as

13

I was suggesting to Justice Stevens, that case

14

involves a kind of unique situation where a habeas

15

petition is filed, challenging a certain kind of

16

confinement, and then after the petition is filed,

17

and after jurisdiction attaches, the prisoner is

18

moved.

19

California to --

20
21

In that case, it was an individual moved from

QUESTION:

They never, they never named

any custodian in that case, did they?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't know for sure,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, but I would say a couple of

24

things.

25

think that is a rule that perhaps the government

One is on the immediate custodian rule, I

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

could waive in a case, and so if you have a situation

2

- - -

3

In a way Hamdi is that case where when the

4

habeas petition in Hamdi was filed, he was being

5

detained in Norfolk, which was in the Eastern

6

District of Virginia.

7

whether the immediate custodian was Paulette, who is

8

the brig, the commander of the brig, or Rumsfeld

9

because in the government's view, they are both

It did not matter in that case

10

territorially present in the Eastern District of

11

Virginia.

12

So the immediate custodian rule I think is

13

something that government can waive.

14

that the territorial jurisdiction limit on the

15

courts, though, is something that the government is

16

in a position to waive.

17

restriction on the power of the court to issue the

18

writ of habeas, and again, as I was indicating --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

I don't think

I think that is a

Well, is there a circuit split

on whether aliens can name the attorney general?
MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

22

There is a circuit split on that issue, and I think

23

in some ways that issue is sort of tied up with this

24

case, though even there as I understand most of those

25

cases, there is a case from the Ninth Circuit called

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Armentero, which in the government's view goes the

2

wrong way.

3

Circuit, the First Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit,

4

but even the Ninth Circuit, I think, envisions a case

5

where they view the attorney general as the proper

6

custodian, but they, you know, it's not clear where

7

they think that individual can be served.

8
9

There is favorable precedent in the Sixth

Now, I suppose that the Ninth Circuit
applying that rule might also take the unprecedented

10

step here.

11

sense of the potential for abuse in these cases, I

12

think you could point to the Ninth Circuit case where

13

the Ninth Circuit held that the Central District of

14

California had habeas jurisdiction over a claim filed

15

by a petitioner in Guantanamo.

16

there is the issue that this Court has, but there is

17

a question of if there were jurisdiction, I wouldn't

18

have thought that it lay in the Central District of

19

California.

20

It's also true if you want a sort of

And I think that happens when you relax

21

these traditional rules.

22

a case like --

23
24
25

I mean, obviously

QUESTION:

And I think particularly in

Where does jurisdiction lie for

someone in Guantanamo, do you suppose?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if, let me answer the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

question this way, which is if you had a citizen in

2

Guantanamo.

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

And under this Court's cases

5

like Toth against Quarles and Burns against Wilson,

6

that citizen is unable to file a habeas petition.

7

Our view is that the proper place to file that would

8

be either in the Eastern District of Virginia, if you

9

were naming the Secretary of Defense or if were you

10

naming some official present in the district, you

11

would sue in the District of Columbia.

12

But the important thing is even in that

13

case, the court where you filed the petition would

14

have jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction over the

15

Respondent and what is so anomalous here is in a

16

sense, it doesn't, I mean it matters to us in the

17

sense that we think the proper Respondent is

18

Commander Marr, but even if you assume the proper

19

Respondent here is secretary Rumsfeld, the case still

20

shouldn't be brought in the Southern District of New

21

York. It should be brought in the Eastern District of

22

Virginia.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But why?

Why, what difference

does it make to the government where they defend?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think there are a

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

number of --

2
3

QUESTION:

I mean, there are offices all

over the country.

4

MR. CLEMENT: I think that's right, Justice

5

Stevens.

I think it only makes sense to have the

6

defense mounted in the place where the detention is

7

taking place.

8

in this case, because this isn't a petition that only

9

challenges the fact of confinement.

And I think that's particularly true

If you look at

10

the, the petition in this case, the amended petition,

11

joint appendix page 56, the relief that's sought here

12

also goes to the conditions of confinement in

13

Commander Marr's brig.

14

seems --

15

QUESTION:

Now, in a case like that, it

Yes, but I'm not sure that's,

16

that's appropriate relief in a habeas petition,

17

anyway.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think you can file a

19

mixed petition and seek that kind of relief, but in

20

any event, I think that what they are looking for is

21

not just release from detention, but the stopping of

22

the interrogations.

23

QUESTION:

-- how this particular case was

24

pleaded, which it wasn't, because we don't have any

25

flushing out of this, but you keep talking about

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction and it seems to me, this is essentially

2

a venue question.

3

courts have habeas jurisdiction.

4

authority.

5

There is no question that Federal
They have that

And you are talking about not the large

6

question, what kind of case can a Federal court hear,

7

you are talking about a where question, not a what

8

question.

9

So it's essentially a venue question.
MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, unless the word

10

essentially is going to bear a tremendous amount of

11

weight, I disagree because I think that what you have

12

here is not general venue principles.

13

situation where the relevant statute that gives

14

courts habeas jurisdiction restricts their ability to

15

issue the writ to their territorial jurisdiction.

16

And this Court has been clear in cases like Carbo and

17

this is even consistent in Justice Rutledge's dissent

18

in the Ahrens case, that for that provision to have

19

any meaning at an irreducible minimum, it has to mean

20

that a writ that goes to the proper custodian has to

21

be filed within the territorial jurisdiction of the

22

District Court.

23

QUESTION:

You have a

Although, if the prisoner is

24

moved, so prisoner goes someplace else, they still

25

have jurisdiction over the case, although the

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

original custodian no longer has the prisoner in his

2

or her care.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice

4

Ginsburg.

And this Court decided that in Endo long

5

before Ahrens when it reaffirmed an even stricter

6

rule and there is nothing in the post-Ahrens cases

7

that suggests that this Court has ever deviated from

8

this understanding.

9

Court to the decision in Schlanger against Seamans,

And indeed I would point the

10

because I think in some ways, it shows how, that that

11

case really decided this issue, because what the

12

court there had was an individual who was trying to

13

get ROTC scholarship in Arizona, but he was assigned

14

to a unit in Alabama, and he filed his habeas

15

petition in Arizona, and he named as Respondents an

16

individual in Arizona who had no custody over him

17

whatsoever, so that individual was out.

18

named the Secretary of the Air Force.

19

not rely on that, and the court said that his true

20

custodian is his commanding officer in Georgia, and

21

what this Court said is there was no jurisdiction in

22

Arizona over that custodian in Georgia, and just to

23

be clear about it, the Court noted and rejected an

24

argument based on 28 U.S.C. 1391(e), which among

25

other things provides nationwide service of process

He also
The court did

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

against Federal officials.
Now, if that statute had applied, then it

3

would have been perfectly appropriate to bring the

4

case in Arizona against a Georgia Respondent who was

5

a Federal officer.

6

does not trump the habeas statute.

7

true of a Federal statute that provides for

8

nationwide service of process, it seems like it would

9

be true a fortiori for Federal Rule of Civil

But the Court said no.

1391(e)

Now, if that is

10

Procedure 4.

11

courts below exercised jurisdiction in this case.

12
13
14

But that's the theory under which the

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Clement, is Schlanger

still good law after Strait and Braden?
MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And

15

I think the best evidence of that, there is two

16

things I'd like to point to.

17

way is that both Strait and Braden cite Schlanger

18

favorably and, indeed, if you look at the very end of

19

the Braden opinion, when the court says that the

20

proper Respondent there is within the court's service

21

of process, it sites Schlanger for that proposition,

22

which makes sense because in that case the petition

23

was properly filed, challenging a Kentucky detainer

24

in Kentucky, so the proper Respondent was within the

25

territorial jurisdiction of the court in that case.

But maybe the simplest

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

The second reason I would say that

2

Schlanger is very much good law as we pointed out in

3

our reply brief, is that the court in Schlanger went

4

out of its way, because at that point, Ahrens was

5

sort of already teetering on the verge of

6

obsolescence, to state that the rule would be exactly

7

the same even under Justice Rutledge's view in

8

Ahrens, so I think for those two reasons, Schlanger

9

continues to be good law, and clearly would trump any

10

service of process that would be provided by Rule 4.

11

And I think, and this is consistent with

12

what the unanimous three-judge court in the Fourth

13

Circuit said in the Hamdi case, that particularly in

14

cases that raise such sensitive issues as the cases

15

that are involved on the merits in this case, it is

16

particularly important that the court try to avoid

17

unnecessarily reaching Constitutional issues by first

18

ascertaining that it has jurisdiction.

19

QUESTION:

Now, if I --

You recognize that it isn't a

20

jurisdiction question like, can the Federal courts

21

entertain this kind of suit.

22

fender bender between people from the same state?

23

No.

24

have one Federal system, and there are classes of

25

cases that can go into that system and then we have

Can they entertain a

Can they entertain Federal habeas cases.

So we

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

an allocation of where, so this isn't jurisdiction

2

writ large, it is where in this Federal system do you

3

bring this case?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, its

5

statutory jurisdiction, but I agree.

6

level it is a which District Court question, not

7

whether District Courts are open to these claims at

8

all.

9

QUESTION:

All right.

It is at some

If it's a which

10

District Court question, I mean, I don't know how

11

long you want to spend on the procedural issue, but I

12

take it if we follow your thing, never can you

13

entertain a habeas petition unless the body is in

14

this district, then immigration cases, military cases

15

are going to be a nightmare.

16

principle, you are going to get just the right

17

result, which is we bring the case where it's most

18

convenient.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

If we follow a venue

With respect, Justice

20

Breyer, I would disagree.

I think that this Court,

21

it is true, in situations where it has relaxed the

22

notion of custody, and has allowed habeas petitions

23

to be brought in circumstances where they previously

24

weren't available, Strait against Laird is an

25

example.

This Court's decision in Braden, basically

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

is an example because it was accommodating the

2

overruling of McNally against Hill and Payton against

3

Rowe.

4

one custody or some kind of metaphysical custody,

5

this Court has relaxed the rules in a way to

6

accommodate those, but it has never deviated.

7

from the rule that you have to file the habeas

8

petition where the custodian is, and equally

9

important, it has never, there is no need to expand

So in those contexts, where there is more than

Never,

10

the notion of custody, because you have a classic

11

habeas case where you are challenging your present

12

physical confinement.

13

rules.

14
15

QUESTION:

The courts never relax the

Let me ask you a question to

get you to the merits, if I can.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17

QUESTION:

That would be fine.

Suppose, suppose that you're

18

right about your basic claim that the uniform, what

19

is it called, the Use of Force Act is in fact a

20

statute of the kind contemplated in 4001.

21

words in that act are, they can use necessary and

22

appropriate force.

23

appropriate in a country that has its courts open,

24

that has regular criminal proceedings, that has all

25

the possibility of adjudicating a claim that I'm the

Still, the

So why would it be necessary and

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

wrong person?

Why is it a necessary and appropriate

2

thing to do once you have such a person who is a

3

citizen in this country to proceed by other than a

4

normal court procedure?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, I will

6

answer the question.

I would preface it by saying

7

that I certainly wouldn't read the authorization of

8

force's use of the term necessary and appropriate as

9

an invitation for sort of judicial management of the

10

executive's war-making power.

11

as a delegation to the executive to use its

12

traditional authority to make discretionary judgments

13

in finding what is the necessary appropriate force.

14

And the Prize cases, I think, stand for that

15

proposition.

16

I would have viewed it

Now, if I can address the specifics,

17

though, why it might be necessary and appropriate

18

and, indeed, why is the Government asserting this

19

authority?

20

terrorism, the Government can confront an individual

21

who is not only guilty of past war crimes, but

22

also --

23

It is precisely because, in this war on

QUESTION:

Can I ask you just one last

24

question on the jurisdictional issue?

If you assume

25

it's a question of venue rather than jurisdiction --

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

I know you're arguing in the alternative, but if you

2

assume it was venue rather than jurisdiction, would

3

New York not have been the proper venue since he was

4

held there as a material witness and he had a lawyer

5

appointed in that case?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Even if, contrary to our

7

position, it was a venue question, we would still say

8

no.

9

mean, the fact that he was in New York in the first

And I think that you have to understand -- I

10

place is a bit of a happenstance.

11

Chicago.

12

He tries to fly to

He is seized in Chicago -QUESTION:

No, but the Government is

13

responsible for him being in New York, which it seems

14

to me, that they should not be complaining about

15

litigating there.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, with respect, Justice

17

Stevens, I don't think anybody would think that if

18

you filed a habeas petition to challenge Padilla's

19

detention as a material witness while he was being

20

detained in New York, that that should be filed in

21

Chicago.

22

And I think by the same logic, it doesn't

23

make any sense from what the gravamen of the -- the

24

gravamen of the challenge is to the conditions and

25

legality of the detention in South Carolina, why that

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

ought to be filed in New York just because he was

2

there under a different authority.

3
4

QUESTION:

He had a lawyer appointed,

didn't he, there?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

He did have a lawyer

6

appointed there.

7

I think Mr. Dunham or his equivalent in South

8

Carolina would be available to provide whatever role

9

is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.

10

But again, I don't think -- I mean,

I don't think there are only lawyers in New York.

QUESTION:

I suppose it's a little easier

12

for the Government to find a lawyer wherever it needs

13

it than it would be for a prisoner being moved from

district to district.

MR. CLEMENT:

In none of these cases have

left other than to say that we would still -- I mean,

2

I think all I would say, and maybe I can reference

3

that there are Court of Appeals cases, the Seventh

4

Circuit has decided this Ross against Mebane case

5

that basically say that even if you're in a venue

6

situation, even if you're within the rule of Ex parte

7

Endo, there is still a strong, strong presumption

8

that a habeas petition belongs in the district court

9

where the individual is being detained.

10

Now, maybe if you had a situation where

11

the habeas petition was up and running and close to a

12

final judgment or whatever.

13

is detained, it makes sense to keep the proceeding in

14

the first venue.

15

case where the day after the first petition is filed,

16

he's moved for independent and good reasons, I think

17

you would also say that the case belongs in the place

18

of detention.

And then the individual

QUESTION:

What rights does Padilla have,

apprehended on the battlefield does not have?

Padilla just the same as somebody you catch in

he is just the same.

It may be that in an

appropriate juncture when the Court has before it the

question of what procedure should be applied, that

4

you would want to apply different procedures in a

5

case like this.

QUESTION:

Can we punish him?

MR. CLEMENT:

Could we punish him?

Certainly we could punish him if we decided to change

5

QUESTION:

But if the law is what the

6

executive says it is, whatever is necessary and

7

appropriate in the executive's judgment, that's the

8

resolution you gave us that Congress passed, and it

9

leads you up to the executive, unchecked by the

10

judiciary.

So what is it that would be a check

11

against torture?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

are treaty obligations.

14

that just as in every other war, if a U.S. military

15

person commits a war crime by creating some atrocity

16

on a harmless, you know, detained enemy combatant or

17

a prisoner of war, that violates our own conception

of what's a war crime.

3

QUESTION:

What's constraining?

That's

4

the point.

Is it just up to the good will of the

5

executive?

Is there any judicial check?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

This is a situation where

7

there is jurisdiction in the habeas courts.

So if

8

necessary, they remain open.

9

important -- I mean, the court in Ludecke against

But I think it's very

10

Watkins made clear that the fact that executive

11

discretion in a war situation can be abused is not a

12

good and sufficient reason for judicial

13

micromanagement and overseeing of that authority.

14

You have to recognize that in situations

15

where there is a war -- where the Government is on a

16

war footing, that you have to trust the executive to

17

make the kind of quintessential military judgments

18

that are involved in things like that.

19

So what is it that military --

the time in the criminal process.

assuming this resolution authorizes some kind of

force, why isn't the appropriate force, where he's in

the United States and the courts are open, what we

6

would call ordinary criminal process?

harmonizes everything.

10

So if you're even

I mean, that

Now, maybe there is an answer to that in
your vision.

I want to find out your vision of

what's supposed to happen here and why.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, let me

12

give you a practical reason answer and the legal

13

reason.

14

the practical reason is if you capture somebody who

15

is not just somebody who is guilty of a war crime or

16

a violation of some provision of Title 18, but also

17

has a wealth of information that could be used to

18

prevent future terrorist attacks, then it seems to me

19

that the military ought to have the option of

20

proceeding with him in a way that allows him to get

21

actionable intelligence to prevent future terrorist

22

attacks, and should not be forced into a choice where

23

the only way they can proceed is to proceed

24

retrospectively to try to punish him for past acts.

25

You may prefer the former.

But I think that

In doing so, whether it's a military

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

commission or an Article III, requires you to give

2

him a counsel who likely is going to say that you

3

shouldn't talk to the Government about any of these

4

things.

5

QUESTION:

Would you have that authority

6

in the absence of the authorizing resolution?

7

the President have that authority?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

I think he might well,

Justice Souter, and you in fact suggested that

10

yourself, which is if there was actionable

11

information --

12

Would

QUESTION:

No, I suggested that he might

13

have on September 12th.

14

went much further.

15

argument, but do you believe he would have that

16

authority today in the absence of the authorizing

17

resolution?

18

I don't think my suggestion

But I'll grant you that's an

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think he would

19

certainly today, which is to say September 12th or

20

April 28th.

21

QUESTION:

Two and a half months later.

22

But I mean, based on the rationale that there is a

23

need to bar him from what would be the normal process

24

that Justice Breyer is describing because of the need

25

to interrogate effectively.

Your answer, I take it,

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

is he would have that authority even without the

2

authorizing resolution?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

That would be my answer.

4

would say the President had that authority on

5

September 10th, but I guess I would --

6

QUESTION:

I

How does he get that from just

7

being commander-in-chief?

I mean, I understand the

8

commander-in-chief power to be a power over the

9

military forces, when they're being used as military

10

forces, the General Washington power, you know, to

11

command the forces tactically and everything else.

12

It doesn't mean that he has power to do

13

whatever it takes to win the war.

14

Seizure case demonstrates that well enough.

15

this come within George Washington's

16

commander-in-chief power, which is what I read this

17

congressional resolution to be directed at?

18

doesn't say you can do whatever it takes to win the

19

war.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, the Steel
How does

It

No, but Justice Scalia,

21

presumably the authorization of force is read against

22

prior history and this Court's precedents.

23

precedents include the Quirin case where it is

24

absolutely clear that in fighting a war, you have the

25

authority to detain individuals, even if they're not

And those

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

formal military officers who are affiliated with the

2

enemy and come into the United States intent on

3

committing hostile and warlike acts.

4

QUESTION:

But Quirin rested on the fact

5

that there was congressional authorization for a

6

military commission to try on such charges.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two things, Justice

8

Souter.

First of all, I mean, you asked me a

9

hypothetical but we do have the authorization of

10

force here.

Second of all, I don't think Quirin can

11

stand for the kind of clear statement rule that

12

others want to attribute to it for two reasons.

13

One, to the extent it applied any clear

14

statement rule, it runs in the opposite direction.

15

The Court said they would not strike down the

16

detention and try the individuals there absent a

17

clear conviction that it violated an act of Congress.

18

QUESTION:

I guess I would settle, as a

19

rhetorical point, for the fact that it's not a clear

20

statement for you either.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it actually -- it

22

purported to be.

It said absent a clear conviction,

23

it wouldn't strike down the authority.

24

would -- just to be clear, I think as we point out in

25

our reply brief, if you applied a clear statement

But what I

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

rule to Quirin, it would have to come out the other

2

way because Article II of the articles of war that

3

were in force at the time were restricted to members

4

of the United States military.

5

Article 15, which the Court relied on,

6

didn't expressly authorize military commissions

7

expressly.

8

it's simply not the case that you need an express

9

statutory authorization.

10
11
12

It did so by negative implication.

If I could reserve my time

for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Clement.

Ms. Martinez, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER MARTINEZ

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

15
16
17

So

MS. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Even in wartime, America has always been a

18

nation governed by the rule of law.

19

Government asks this Court for a broad ruling that

20

would allow the President unlimited power to imprison

21

any American anywhere at any time without trial

22

simply by labeling him an enemy combatant.

23

Today the

We ask this Court for a narrow ruling that

24

leaves for another day the grave constitutional

25

question of whether our system would permit the

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

indefinite imprisonment without trial of American

2

citizens on American soil based on suspicion that

3

they have associated with terrorists.

4

We simply ask this Court to hold that at a

5

minimum Congress would have to clearly and

6

unequivocally authorize such a departure from our

7

nation's traditions.

8

so, Mr. Padilla is entitled to be charged with a

9

crime and to have his day in court.

10

And since Congress has not done

The detention at issue in this case is

11

exactly the type of detention that our Founding

12

Fathers were concerned about based on their

13

experience with the British Crown, where the king had

14

locked up citizens based on --

15

QUESTION:

Ms. Martinez, the authorization

16

passed by Congress is quite broad and it talks about

17

force against individuals.

18

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor, but there

19

is no reference in the text of that authorization to

20

any power to detain American citizens on American

21

soil based on suspicion.

22

whatsoever in the debates that Congress contemplated

23

that it might be used in such a way.

24
25

QUESTION:

And there is no indication

Well, you surely don't think

that it excluded American citizens.

I mean,

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

certainly it gave the President authority to wage war

2

against American citizens if they're on the other

3

side, didn't it?

4
5
6

MS. MARTINEZ:

Certainly, Your Honor,

as -QUESTION:

So whatever authority it gave

7

him, there is no indication that it's limited to

8

non-citizens.

9

MS. MARTINEZ:

No, but what is limited to

10

citizens is Section 4001 in which Congress

11

specifically provided that no citizen shall be

12

imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States

13

except pursuant to an act of Congress.

14

QUESTION:

And you would say that 4001

15

prevents the President from detaining on the

16

battlefield?

17

MS. MARTINEZ:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

No, Your Honor.

Well, then it doesn't mean what

you just said it meant.
MS. MARTINEZ:

What we are talking

21

about -- first of all, there is a general presumption

22

against extraterritorial application of statutes.

23

And so in the absence of an indication that Congress

24

intended 4001 to apply overseas, that general

25

presumption would limit it to this country.

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Moreover, the history of 4001 --

2
3

QUESTION:

doesn't apply to 4001?

4
5

MS. MARTINEZ:

QUESTION:

10

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor, we are and

our argument is limited to detentions within this
country --

11
12

Well, I thought you were

arguing for the clear statement rule.

8
9

Which clear statement rule,

Your Honor?

6
7

So the clear statement rule

QUESTION:

But your qualification is only

implied from the statute.

13

MS. MARTINEZ:

Our argument is that what

14

there needs to be a clear statement of is of the

15

authority to detain an American citizen on American

16

soil.

17

history of section 4001 in which Congress looked at

18

the Emergency Detention Act that had been passed

19

during the Cold War which would have allowed the

20

President, in case of an internal security emergency

21

or war, to imprison individuals based on suspicion

22

that they were associated with a foreign power and

23

were going to engage in acts of sabotage.

And the reason for that is given, one, by the

24

QUESTION:

What about hijackers?

25

resolution has to do with 9/11.

The

And the people were

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

hijackers and a lot of the hijackers are up in the

2

airplane and then they land.

3

resolution wasn't aimed at them in part?

4

MS. MARTINEZ:

Do you think that the

Your Honor, our position is

5

that certainly the President would have inherent

6

authority with or without this resolution to seize an

7

individual who is engaged in an act like that that

8

took place on 9/11.

9

been seized, in order for that person to be held

But after that individual had

10

in detention in this country, if they are a citizen,

11

in particular, there must be some express statutory

12

authorization that provides a framework for that

13

ongoing detention.

14

4001, but also from the Due Process Clause, and --

15

QUESTION:

And that comes not only from

And if they are captured on the

16

battlefield and then brought here, 4001 clicks into

17

operation, in your view?

18

MS. MARTINEZ:

Our position is that 4001

19

applies within the United States and its text means

20

what it says, that no, no person --

21
22

QUESTION:

Well, then your answer to my

question is yes?

23

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

So if you were --

25

QUESTION:

So if we found American

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

citizens in Iraq who were firing on our forces and

2

brought them back here, they would have to be given

3

an Article III trial?

4

MS. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, our position is

5

that Congress could provide for some alternative

6

legislative scheme for dealing with such individuals.

7

QUESTION:

What about my question on Iraq?

8

MS. MARTINEZ:

At this time, our position

9

would be that such persons would have to be given an

10

Article III trial, unless Congress came in with some

11

other provision.

12

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Why do you distinguish citizen, if

13

we are talking about someone like Padilla, who is in

14

the United States, the Due Process Clause refers to

15

person, not citizen?

16

between brought into the United States, but within

17

the United States, if it's someone who is, is an

18

alien, but is here with permission, a resident alien,

19

say --

20

So I can see a distinction

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

We would

21

agree that such persons are protected by the Due

22

Process Clause.

23

we would agree that aliens within this country might

24

certainly be protected as well.

25

does not present that question, but we would not

4001 refers only to citizens.

But

This case simply

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

disagree with that.

2

QUESTION:

I think what is important -Well, let's get to that

3

question.

4

about 4001, and we think the authorization for use of

5

military force supersedes that.

6

is your position with respect to the rights of your

7

client?

8
9

Let's assume that we disagree with you

MS. MARTINEZ:

Then what, then what

If Your Honors believe that

4000 -- that the authorization was meant to

10

specifically authorize the detention of American

11

citizens on American soil, we would contend first

12

that there is no limiting principle within that

13

authorization for who may be detained.

14

Government claims that anyone who is associated with

15

Al Qaeda falls within this definition.

16

QUESTION:

The

So the principle would be that

17

if somebody is like a missile sent over here, you

18

know, he is actually one of the hijackers or the

19

equivalent thereof, that's an obvious limiting

20

principle, that people who are sent offshore, sent

21

right over here and we catch them in mid-air.

22

MS. MARTINEZ:

I think when you start

23

trying to draw those lines on a case-by-case basis

24

where this individual because they are actually in

25

the midst of a hijacking is close enough whereas some

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

other individual who is merely in the early stages of

2

a plot might not be enough, the difficulty of drawing

3

those lines shows the need for clear Congressional

4

action here.

5

This is primarily a job for Congress to

6

create, if there is a need in this country for

7

preventive detention of terrorists, that's a

8

legislative job for our legislature to undertake.

9

QUESTION:

Declarations of war are just

10

not written this way.

The Iraq declaration is not.

11

The recent declarations of war, formal declarations

12

are not, and AMUF is not.

13

MS. MARTINEZ:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

That's correct.

That's just not the tradition.

The President is given the authority.
MS. MARTINEZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

17

But broad authorizations for use of force in wartime

18

have also not traditionally been interpreted to allow

19

the executive unlimited power over citizens.

20

cases like Duncan and Endo, this Court has said that

21

a wartime authorization for action by the executive

22

should not be construed broadly, but should be

23

construed narrowly to give only the power that it

24

clearly and unequivocally indicates.

25

QUESTION:

So in

Well, Endo was concededly

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

loyal, and Duncan were civil crimes, a stockbroker

2

who was embezzling, right?

3

MS. MARTINEZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

But what 4001 was intended to prevent was a claim by

5

the executive that his broad inherent powers in

6

wartime, which was specifically what 4001 addressed,

7

would be enough to allow the detention of American

8

citizens.

9

QUESTION:

Right.

Can you give me a

10

minute or so on the, or as long as you want or short,

11

but suppose you get to the similar place by saying

12

that this resolution, suppose hypothetically, I'm not

13

saying what my view is, but hypothetically, suppose

14

you get to the same place by saying, yes, that

15

wartime resolution still doesn't authorize departing

16

from use of the criminal system, the ordinary

17

criminal system for somebody in the United States,

18

but for an unusually good reason.

19

Now, we have two possible reasons

20

advanced, one orally that we need to question him,

21

and one in the briefs, a suggestion that this man is

22

a ticking time bomb, and we can't reveal the evidence

23

without destroying intelligence.

24

vision of how this is supposed to play out under an

25

ordinary criminal system in response perhaps to what

Now, I'd like your

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

those claims are.

MS. MARTINEZ:

Our view would be that

3

because of the difficulty of the question of

4

determining, for example, as I believe Justice

5

Kennedy asked earlier, how long would such

6

interrogation be necessary?

7

be required to take evidence on those sorts of

8

issues?

9

Would the district court

In the event that there were no other

10

alternatives, we believe that would be appropriate,

11

but we also believe that's quintessentially a

12

question for Congress, which could hold legislative

13

hearings.

14

conclusion about what was required in this context.

15

And after due deliberation, come to some

And that is in fact what our democratic

16

allies, United Kingdom and Israel, have done in

17

passing specific legislation about the preventive

18

detention of suspected terrorists based on a

19

legislative finding about what periods of time --

20

QUESTION:

Well, that would be, of course,

21

perhaps, desirable, but we are faced with a situation

22

of the here and now, and what do we do?

23

MS. MARTINEZ:

24

QUESTION:

25

Your Honor --

We just turn loose a ticking

time bomb?

MS. MARTINEZ:

No, Your Honor.

I believe

2

that, first of all, were this Court to rule that it

3

was -- that Congressional action was required, I have

4

no doubt that Congress would step into the breach

5

very quickly to provide whatever authorization the

6

executive branch deemed necessary.

7

there is no doubt that Congress would fill that

8

measure.

9

And so I think

Here in this particular case, the

10

Government has already said that Mr. Padilla no

11

longer possesses any intelligence value, and so his

12

interrogation is at an end.

13

two years in detention, without any sort of hearing,

14

without any access to counsel, it's more than

15

appropriate that he be charged with a crime unless

16

Congress comes forward with some alternative scheme.

17

And at this point, after

Now, if I may turn for a moment to the

18

issue of jurisdiction.

19

suggestions, this case does primarily involve issues

20

of venue and not jurisdiction.

21

held that there is a hard and fast rule requiring an

22

immediate custodian, and this Court has also not

23

applied rigid territorial requirements about the

24

location of a suit.

25

Contrary to Mr. Clement's

This Court has never

And in particular, in the Strait case,

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court made clear that the type of jurisdiction

2

that was necessary was jurisdiction making the

3

Respondent amenable to service of process under the

4

long arm provisions by citing International Shoe and

5

McGee, which are provisions applying normal rules of

6

personal jurisdiction.

7

Given the particular circumstances of this

8

case, the extensive personal involvement of Secretary

9

Rumsfeld in this matter, makes him an appropriate

10

Respondent and New York is an appropriate venue for

11

this suit.

12

York.

13

Counsel was appointed and litigation had begun.

14

was the Government's choice to remove him from that

15

forum, but that does not change the fundamental fact

16

that jurisdiction was proper in New York.

17

The Government brought Mr. Padilla to New

They placed him in court proceedings there.

QUESTION:

It

Are you -- are you suggesting

18

then that this case might be an exception to some

19

more general rule because of the peculiar facts that

20

you have just recited?

21

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

22

that -- I think there is no hard and fast general

23

rule as the Government states it.

24

exceptions already to the rule that the Government

25

articulates that can be found in prior cases.

There are numerous

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, maybe there should be

2

some more definite rule.

3

that generally it's the Secretary of Defense and his

4

venue is in the Eastern District of Virginia.

5

MS. MARTINEZ:

Supposing we were to say

This Court might very well

6

decide to make such a venue rule, but I would note

7

that the Government at this point in the case has

8

waived their objection to venue by not pursuing it on

9

appeal.

10
11
12
13

They challenged venue in the district court,

and they did not appeal that.
QUESTION:

Well, but they have certainly

challenged the proper custodian here.
MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

They have

14

challenged the proper custodian, but as this

15

court's decisions in cases like Endo, like

16

Eisentrager make clear, that the identity of the

17

proper Respondent is not a hard and fast or absolute

18

jurisdictional rule.

19

QUESTION:

That doesn't change it from

20

jurisdiction to venue.

I mean, venue is venue and

21

jurisdiction is jurisdiction.

22

jurisdictional rule has been so haphazard that

23

effectively it amounts to the same thing.

24

argument will stand and fall on the basis of the

25

cases that you and Mr. Clement have discussed.

You may say that the

And that

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

But to say that this is, this is venue is

2

simply wrong.

3

jurisdiction of the Court, and it's always been

4

treated by that way in our opinions.

5

discussed it as a venue rule.

6

I mean, it is a matter of the

MR. MARTINEZ:

We have not

Well, Your Honor, I do agree

7

that there is a jurisdictional question, and we

8

agreed that -- we argued that jurisdiction is proper.

9

But what Braden says is that the rule that Ahrens had

10

announced as a hard and fast jurisdictional rule

11

reflected nothing more than traditional venue

12

concerns.

13

And so Braden specifically says that

14

that -- that which was discussed in Ahrens went to

15

venue and not to jurisdiction.

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Returning --

Where you had conceivably

proper jurisdiction in several places.
MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we

19

would argue that jurisdiction was proper in New York

20

in this case because --

21

QUESTION:

We are talking if we are using

22

the jurisdictional label, it's personal jurisdiction,

23

and not subject matter jurisdiction.

24
25

MS. MARTINEZ:

That's correct, Your Honor,

and under this Court's decision in Strait, there was

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld in New

2

York because of his contacts with that forum.

3

Returning to the merits of this case, what

4

I think is important for this Court to realize is

5

that the war on terror presents many difficult

6

questions about the proper balance between civil

7

liberties and national security.

8

body of our government that has been -- that was

9

entrusted by the Founders for making law to deal with

Congress is the

10

new situations.

11

considering the various parameters of any sort of

12

scheme of detention that might be necessary.

13

And Congress is fully capable of

And certainly this Court would have the

14

power to review, to determine whether that system

15

established by Congress were constitutional, but what

16

we have here is a claim by the executive to a

17

virtually unlimited system, where any person that the

18

President deems an enemy combatant --

19

QUESTION:

But on the basis of the, of the

20

Congressional authorization.

He is not claiming it

21

just by virtue of executive power.

22

MS. MARTINEZ:

Well, he claims them both

23

on the basis of inherent executive power and on the

24

basis of the authorization.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but since they are, since

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

they are both the weakest -- weakest claim is

2

probably solely the executive.

3

to deal with the claim that it's Congressional

4

authorization.

5

MS. MARTINEZ:

But I think you have

Yes, Your Honor.

There is

6

simply no indication that when Congress passed the

7

Authorization for Use of Military Force which enabled

8

us to deploy our troops overseas, the Congress also

9

thought that they were authorizing the indefinite

10

military detention without trial of American citizens

11

on American soil.

dramatic departure from our constitutional

traditions.

15

provision that allowed the detention of aliens for

16

seven days.

17

There was no debate of such a

And just a few weeks later when Congress

The trouble is, I don't see how

18

you can -- I mean, I think I can understand your

saying it doesn't give him any power except a

read it that way.

to say it applies to everybody, but not to United

States citizens.

25

I can understand that.

You might

That line is just not there in the

We would say it does not

apply off the battlefield, certainly to U.S. citizens

And this Court --

QUESTION:

But it does apply to aliens.

4

We -- the President could use force against aliens

5

under that resolution.

6

8
9

MS. MARTINEZ:

This Court need not decide

that in this case, and I certainly don't -QUESTION:

I understand, but you are

proposing to us an interpretation of the resolution,

10

which I suggest makes no sense, unless you are

11

willing to say that it also doesn't apply to aliens

12

that are being brought -- that are committing these

13

acts within the country.

14

MS. MARTINEZ:

I would agree that it does

15

not -- the authorization does not clearly indicate

16

that it's applicable to aliens either.

17

QUESTION:

He might have the power to take

18

up the aliens and arrest them any way because 4001

19

doesn't prohibit it?

20

MS. MARTINEZ:

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. MARTINEZ:

Correct, Your Honor.

Is that your point?
Correct, Your Honor.

That

23

is our point, which is that the degree of specificity

24

that would need to be required to authorize this kind

25

of extraordinary detention of citizens would be

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

greater, and in particular with aliens, there has

2

always been a greater power of the executive because

3

they have no right to be here.

4

QUESTION:

Then I take it then you have

5

no, assuming -- assuming that 4001 has been

6

superseded by the authorization.

7

no principal basis for distinguishing between

8

citizens and aliens insofar as detaining an enemy

9

belligerent?

10

MS. MARTINEZ:

I assume you have

No, Your Honor.

As to

11

individuals within the United States, if 4001 is not

12

at issue because of its specific reference to

13

citizens, we would say aliens within the United

14

States would have the same, would be in exactly the

15

same position.

16
17
18

Correct.

QUESTION:

So you would make no

distinction between the two.
MS. MARTINEZ:

Correct, Your Honor, were

19

it not for 4001.

20

just for broad authorization of executive power, but

21

specific authorization, because 4001 was concerned

22

with the situation where there was a general

23

declaration of war, or where there was some type of

24

internal emergency.

25

But we think 4001 calls for not

And the concern was that the executive

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

should not be able to rely on that general

2

declaration of war or that general situation to lock

up citizens.

That was precisely the situation with

declaration of war the power to imprison American

citizens.

legislation.

14

They wanted it to come from specific

QUESTION:

So you say that has no

15

application on the battlefield because of the

16

principle of no extraterritorial effect of

17

United States statutes?

18

MS. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, certainly as to

19

an overseas battlefield, 4001, because of the

20

presumption against extraterritoriality, would not

21

apply.

22

QUESTION:

Now, what if you capture an

23

American combatant and bring him back to the

24

United States, then 4001 --

25

MS. MARTINEZ:

4001 would apply upon his

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

return.

2

QUESTION:

It would apply?

3

MS. MARTINEZ:

Correct.

And let me say

4

also, in respect to the Japanese internment camps,

5

Congress was very specific in passing 4001 that what

6

it wanted was democratic deliberation by our

7

lawmakers about the necessity of this kind of extreme

8

measure, where American citizens might be detained

9

without trial.

10

It didn't want that to slip under the

11

radar, under the umbrella of a general declaration of

12

war or general use of force.

13

that there was specific debate by Congress on those

14

very different constitutional questions presented in

15

those situations by the power of detaining citizens.

16

QUESTION:

It wanted to ensure

Did Congress at the time of

17

4001 consider other systems that do allow for

18

preventative detention, but then require the person

19

periodically to be brought before a judge to make

20

certain that the conditions still exist, like, as is

21

alleged in this case, the need to get evidence?

22

MS. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, there certainly

23

are many other systems that provide for that sort of

24

judicial review.

25

for example, people detained under preventive

In the United Kingdom and Israel,

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

detention schemes are entitled to access to counsel,

2

they are entitled to prompt and periodic judicial

3

review under legislative standards to determine

4

whether those detentions can be continued.

5

And certainly there are many comparative

6

examples out there where legislatures have made those

7

kind of fact-findings about what's appropriate.

8

there is no reason why our legislature could not

9

undertake such --

10

QUESTION:

And

The reason -- and this is why

11

I've been harping on this thing of necessary and

12

appropriate.

13

the traditions of the United States ordinary criminal

14

processes, and you say, well, the forces act, the use

15

of force act, doesn't apply at all, then there is no

16

way to take care of the real emergency, the real

17

emergency, the real ticking time bomb, et cetera,

18

except to go back to Congress, which may or may not

19

act.

20

It seems to me if you take into account

But if you get to the same result by

21

reading the necessary and appropriate thing to take

22

into account our traditions, you do leave the opening

23

there for the possibility of a real emergency which

24

would warrant an extraordinary proceeding.

25

exposing my thought on this so that I can get your

reaction.
MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

3

that's absolutely correct.

You could certainly read

4

the necessary and appropriate language that way.

5

let me also make clear that we are not arguing that

6

the President would have no power either under the

7

AUMF or under his inherent powers to seize an

8

individual in the case of imminent violent activity.

And

9

We are simply talking about his power to

10

continue to detain that individual over many months

11

prior to that initial seizure.

12

how you read the AUMF, that's simply not what they're

13

arguing about.

14

individual has been prevented from carrying out the

15

harmful attack, and once they're in Government

16

custody, can they simply be held forever without

17

trial until the end of the war on terror, or instead,

18

once they're taken into custody, must they be treated

19

in accordance with our positive laws.

20

And so regardless of

We're arguing about, once the

So I take it you would say that

a two and a half years later argument, it would be an

But you would not necessarily have

MS. MARTINEZ:

If there were a situation

8

where an individual, not like my client, but an

9

individual that were on the verge of engaging in

10

imminent violent conduct, certainly the President

11

would have the power, even under the Fourth

12

Amendment, to seize that individual without a warrant

13

and bring him into custody on the basis that they

14

were about to engage in a violent act.

15

But that's a far different situation from

16

seizing someone like my client who is not alleged to

17

be on the verge of imminent lawless activity, was not

18

in the process of hijacking an aircraft but was

19

simply alleged to be part of a plot --

20

QUESTION:

Let me interrupt.

When you say

it is clear he could do it if the defendant was about

That's really a reasonable

QUESTION:

That's the way the statute

2

you're relying on reads, that he shall not be

detained.

So two years has nothing to do with it.

MS. MARTINEZ:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The next day he should, I

6

suppose, you know, hand him over to civil prosecution

7

authorities.

8
9

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor, we would

say at 48 hours under this Court's decisions.

If

10

Congress thinks that a longer period of time is

11

appropriate in terrorism cases, it can do as other

12

countries have done and provide for a longer period

13

of time.

14

In the United Kingdom, there is a 48 hours

15

plus a maximum of 7 days without charge for suspected

16

terrorists.

17

Congress might come in and provide some legislative

18

extension.

19

of 48 hours under County of Riverside would be

20

appropriate.

21

In the United Kingdom, up to 14 days.

But in the absence of that, our normal rule

But we are not just talking

22

about terrorists here.

23

terrorists associated with foreign forces.

24
25

MS. MARTINEZ:

We're talking about

Yes, Your Honor.

And let

me say that those are exactly the sort of individuals

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the passage of 4001 was designed to address.

2

The Emergency Detention Act, which 4001 repealed,

3

specifically talked about the possibility of

4

saboteurs in this country who are under the direction

5

and control of the communist empire.

6

And so there was a specific concern with

7

individuals who might be under that kind of power in

8

4001.

9

such individuals could not simply be detained at

10

executive discretion, but could only be detained

11

pursuant to positive law.

12

simply nonexistent in this case.

13

And Congress wanted to make very clear that

Positive law that is

The type of association with a terrorist

14

organization is also unclear based on the

15

Government's allegations in this case.

16

Government cannot claim that anyone who associated

17

with any member of Al Qaeda at any time would be

18

subject to indefinite military detention without

19

trial.

20

Surely the

Mr. Padilla's mother, because she is

21

associated with her son, may be argued to have

22

associated with Al Qaeda, and clearly that's not what

23

Congress had in mind, to allow that person to be

24

locked up with no right to a lawyer, no right to a

25

hearing for as long as the war on terror lasts.

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

That's simply not consistent with our nation's

2

constitutional traditions, it's a limitless power and

3

there is no call for it in this case.

4
5

QUESTION:

So you say that Judge Mukasey's

solution for this case was not adequate, then?

6

MS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

We do not

7

believe that Judge Mukasey's solution was adequate.

8

We believe that in the first instance, clear

9

authorization and parameters for such detention must

10

come from Congress, defining who ought to be detained

11

and what procedures ought to accompany those

12

detentions.

13

And at that point, this Court could review

14

them for consistency with the Constitution.

15

while certainly Judge Mukasey's order was better than

16

what the Government offered, which was no process at

17

all, no opportunity to be heard and no access to

18

counsel, certainly Judge Mukasey's order was better

19

than that.

20

But no,

But when the indefinite deprivation of a

21

citizen's liberty is at stake, we would argue that

22

the Government must come forward with more than some

23

evidence consisting of any evidence in the record

24

that might support the Government's position that

25

he's associated with terrorists.

When this type of

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

extreme deprivation of liberty is at issue, something

2

more than that is required by the Due Process Clause

3

and by our Constitution.

4

So certainly what we would say is that

5

this Court needs not to decide those issues today, of

6

what precise standard of proof ought to be given,

7

exactly when an individual ought to be allowed access

8

to counsel and what the limits are on how long such

9

an individual could be held, et cetera, because those

10

are primarily questions for Congress.

11

And this Court ought to wait until

12

Congress has come in and provided that kind of

13

guidance before it passes on these grave

14

constitutional questions, which really go to the core

15

of what our democracy is about, which is that the

16

Government cannot take citizens in this country off

17

the street and lock them up in jail forever without a

18

trial.

and it's fundamentally inconsistent with our

traditions.

22

permissible.

That's never the way our country has operated

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

19

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

20

MR. CLEMENT:

And

Thank you, Mr. Chief

21

Justice.

I would like to make just three points.

22

First, on jurisdiction, it is true that the immediate

23

custodian rule is not a hard and fast rule and it has

24

been -- exceptions have been made.

25

territorial jurisdiction rule, as statutorily

But the

56
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

prescribed, limits the Court's jurisdiction and is a

2

hard and fast rule.

3

And the best evidence of the relationship

4

between the two is in those cases where you had to

5

relax one or the other, when you had a citizen

6

detained abroad where the immediate custodian was

7

abroad outside the territorial jurisdiction of any

8

district court, rather than relax the rule of

9

territorial jurisdiction, the Court said you could

10

sue the Secretary of Defense in a district where

11

there is territorial jurisdiction over the

12

individual.

13

It is true there are situations like

14

Strait against Laird that don't involve normal

15

physical confinement, where the Court has had to come

16

up with some rule to deal with the fact that you only

17

have a metaphysical custodian.

18

physical detention of an individual, the Court has

19

never relaxed the rule that you file it in the

20

district where the immediate custodian is located.

21

But in the case of a

And if you look at this Court's decision

22

in Carbo and Justice Rutledge's dissent in Ahrens,

23

you'll see that if you don't respect the rule in a

24

situation like this, there is nothing left to the

25

statutory language and nothing left of the intent of

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the Congress that passed it.
The second point I would like to make is

3

that in looking at this case and the authority that's

4

asserted and the role of 4001(a), it's important to

5

recognize that there is a significant difference

6

between civilian authority and the military authority

7

over enemy combatants.

8

This Court, when it decided Endo and

9

addressed the situation of the detention of the

10

Japanese, specifically carved out the situation of

11

the military detention of enemy combatants and said

12

that that is not involved here.

13

that if Congress, in passing 4001(a) to effectively

14

prevent another Japanese internment camp of

15

concededly loyal citizens also probably wanted to put

16

to one side the issue of military detention of enemy

17

combatants.

It stands to reason

18

In any event, the Court need not

19

ultimately decide whether 4001(a) has any application

20

because the authorization of force clearly provides

21

the necessary act of Congress.

22

Article III courts for these individuals.

23

authorizes military force.

And the relevant line here is provided by
this Court's case in Quirin, when somebody goes

Alderson Reporting Company

1

abroad, associates with the enemy, takes weapons

2

training or explosives training with the enemy, and

3

then returns to the United States with the intent to

4

commit hostile and warlike acts at the direction of

5

the enemy, that classically falls within the Quirin

6

side of the line.

7

It's much different than a Landon Milligan

8

who never left the State of Indiana.

And the

9

military has authority over that individual.

10

Lastly, let me just address the argument

that somehow you can constrain the authorization of

force and read it only to apply in a battlefield
