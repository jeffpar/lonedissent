CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument first

this morning in No. 02-1824, Doug Dretke v. Michael Wayne

5

Haley.

6

Mr. Cruz.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:

11

This case concerns the continuing vitality of the

12

procedural default rule, an important bulwark to federalism,

13

comity, and finality of judgments.

14

consistently maintained that cause and prejudice can address

15

problems with procedural default, and that the actual

16

innocence exception should be applicable only in exceedingly

17

rare cases.

18

This Court has

QUESTION: Can -- can you tell me -- I don't want

19

to derail the argument -- you've conceded that this sentence

20

is unlawful?

21

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy.

22

QUESTION: Well, then why are you here?

Don't -­

23

is there some rule that you can't confess error in your

24

state or?

25

MR. CRUZ: No, Justice Kennedy, but the state is

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

here, because the state is concerned about the impact on the

2

procedural default rule, in particular the Fifth Circuit's

3

decision.

4

QUESTION: Well, so a man does 15 years so you can

5

vindicate your legal point in some other case?

6

don't understand why you don't dismiss this case and move to

7

lower the sentence.

I -- I just

8

MR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default -­

9

QUESTION: And I'd say the same for the Government

10

of the United States.

11

MR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default rule

12

is the premise that petitioner has a valid claim.

13

some ways this case, as the Fifth Circuit remarked, as the

14

judges dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, in some

15

ways this case presents an usually pristine form, I mean,

16

it's almost a law school hypothetical, because the error is

17

so clean.

In -- in

There's a 3-day disparity -­

18

QUESTION: At -- at the prisoner's expense.

19

MR. CRUZ: But that is inherent in any claim with

20
21

procedural default.
QUESTION: No, but it's not a -- it's not a -- as

22

if there's some new trial and -- and it's in doubt.

23

very clear he should not be in jail for, like what, 12, 14,

24

15 more years.

25

It's

MR. CRUZ: It is very clear that there was an

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

error, and that if Mr. Haley had raised the error at trial,

2

that the trail judge would have and should have sustained -­

3

QUESTION: But is it -­

4

QUESTION: Well -­

5

QUESTION: -- not also very clear that he's going

6

to spend over 10 year in jail when he shouldn't spend 10

7

years in jail?

8
9
10

MR. CRUZ: It is clear that he will spend 10 years
in jail when he had an objection he could have raised that
he did not.

11

QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but -- but if

12

the law were followed and everything went perfectly, he

13

would spend less than 2 or -- what is it, 2 or 3 years?

14

MR. CRUZ: Two years would be the max.

15

QUESTION: And he's going to spend 16 years in

16

jail, is that right?

17

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Stevens.

18

QUESTION: Now, is that just, do you think?

19

MR. CRUZ: Maintaining the procedural default rule

20
21
22
23

is -QUESTION: I understand that you want to preserve
the procedures, but do you think justice is being done?
MR. CRUZ: I think justice is being done because he

24

had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his

25

errors, and there's no greater -­

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: Well, let me ask you this.

Why -- why

2

isn't there still an inadequate assistance of counsel claim

3

out there, and why shouldn't the court address that before

4

it gets into the question that it dealt with?

5

MR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think there is a

6

very strong argument that there was inadequate assistance of

7

counsel.

8
9

QUESTION: Well, why don't we vacate and remand and
let them deal with that?

10

MR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think that is

11

something that is open to the Court to do and I think that

12

is one of the fundamental problems with what the district

13

court did.

14

QUESTION: You don't think that that claim was

15

waived here?

16

you?

17
18
19
20
21

You don't urge us to make that finding, do

MR. CRUZ: There is an argument that it was waived,
but I think the Fifth Circuit -­
QUESTION: Well, except the court below didn't
decide that question.
MR. CRUZ: And I think the Fifth Circuit could

22

certainly deem the petitioner's pleading sufficient to

23

preserve that claim.

24

QUESTION: Yeah, I would think so too.

25

QUESTION: Are you saying you won't -- you won't

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

I can't -­

1

argue a waiver if it's sent back?

2
3

MR. CRUZ: If it's sent back, we would be prepared
to address the ineffective assistance claim on its merits.

4
5

QUESTION: And not raise any procedural impediment
to -­

6

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.

7

QUESTION: The -- the -- another feature of this

8

case, what makes it so disturbing, is that the initial error

9

was the prosecutors, in -- when the prosecutor indicted him,

10

that indictment was incorrect, and then the rest followed,

11

relying on that original mistake of the prosecutor.

12

seems a -- really an ideal case for the prosecution to say,

13

we missed it, and then as a result of we -- what we, the

14

prosecutor missed, the court missed it, defense counsel

15

missed it, but it was our error and we should correct it.

16

So it

MR. CRUZ: And, Justice Ginsburg, this case may

17

well, if the Court finds ineffective assistance, that would

18

suffice to correct this, because ineffective assistance

19

counts as cause, and in many ways this case illustrates why

20

cause and prejudice is ample to address error in sentencing

21

in non-capital sentencing and why there's not a need to open

22

the door to a new category of exceptions to procedural

23

default.

24
25

QUESTION: Well, this defendant certainly raised -­
he raised the point in his pro se petition in the state

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

court and he raised it in the Federal court, the ineffective

2

assistance, but nobody paid any attention to him.

3

MR. CRUZ: The -- the claim was denied in state

4

habeas and the Federal habeas court did not address it

5

because it had already granted relief based upon his claim

6

that he was actually innocent of the sentence.

7

QUESTION: Did the prosecutor suggest that maybe

8

the court should have dealt with it, because neither court

9

gave any reason for rejecting that claim?

10

MR. CRUZ: I -- the -- the district court jumped

11

ahead in the process.

12

prejudice, the district court said that it didn't need to

13

address cause and prejudice because it found actual

14

innocence, and that's one of the -- the significant

15

problems, much like statutory interpretation, where a court

16

should -­

17

Rather than address cause and

QUESTION: Mr. Cruz, let me -- let me make -- get

18

clear what -- what -- what your position is.

19

you'd be totally content if we don't resolve this question

20

that's before us about whether whenever there's a procedural

21

default that has clearly resulted and -- and with no

22

ineffective assistance of counsel, that has clearly resulted

23

in an injustice, you know, we -- we throw away all the

24

procedural rules.

25

and just send it back and say, well, before you get to that

You're --

You -- you don't want us to address that

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

question, you have to resolve the cause and prejudice and

2

then leave -- leave dangling in the air the question, the

3

significant question, it seems to me, on which we granted

4

cert?

5

MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, the first preference of

6

the State of Texas is for the Court to address the circuit

7

split and to clarify that there is no actual innocence

8

exception to non-capital sentencing.

9

inclined to do so, the State of Texas, our second preferred

10

outcome is to vacate the decision of the Fifth Circuit so we

11

don't operate under that precedent.

12

If the Court is not

QUESTION: Why should we -- why should we not be

13

inclined to do so?

14

shouldn't reach?

15

jurisprudential striptease and decide this one case, leaving

16

open this question?

17

decide it.

18

Is it a constitutional question that we

I mean, do we have to do a sort of

I don't understand why we wouldn't

MR. CRUZ: And Texas is not urging the Court not to

19

decide it.

20

Court decide to decide -- to rule on this case in a more

21

narrow ground, that is an avenue that would provide some

22

relief to Texas because it would vacate the Fifth Circuit

23

decision and it would allow ultimately for some relief for

24

Mr. Haley as well.

25

It is simply saying that is an avenue should the

QUESTION: So you come back and fight another day?

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

MR. CRUZ: Well, or perhaps someone else would
fight in a different circuit.

3

QUESTION: But if the court views this as a

4

preliminary question, a question that the Fifth Circuit and

5

any other Federal court should have reached logically before

6

it reached the question on which it decided the case -­

7

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice -­

8

QUESTION: -- then we should put the court back in

9
10

the position that it should have been in if it handled the
case correctly.

11

MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree

12

that as a matter of thinking through procedural default,

13

that courts should begin with cause and prejudice, that the

14

actual innocence exception as a potential trump card should

15

not be jumped to first.

16

QUESTION: Well, that just means it made two

17

mistakes.

18

did exist, it shouldn't have reached it first, okay?

19

should have reached it second.

20

two, according to you, is this theory doesn't exist anyway.

Number one, if this theory that you're opposing

Mistake one.

It

And number

21

MR. CRUZ: And -­

22

QUESTION: I don't see why it's more intelligent

23

for us to reach the first question than the second if -- if

24

there isn't any such thing as number one and number two.

25

the only one that exists is number one, it seems to me we

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

If

1

should say so.

2

MR. CRUZ: And, Justice Scalia, I agree entirely

3

with your characterization of the errors made by the court

4

below.

5

QUESTION: May I ask this question?

6

thought there was a manifest injustice exception to the

7

procedural default rule, and as I understand it, the

8

Government concedes there was injustice at the end of their

9

brief.

I always

They say it's less significant, it's a less -­

10

qualitatively less significance than if you put an innocent

11

man to death.

12

injustice in this case?

13
14

MR. CRUZ: Justice Stevens, I -- I do not believe
it is.

It -- it is manifest that there was error -­

15
16

But is it not manifest that there was

QUESTION: Well, can you give me an example of when
manifest injustice would exist other than a death case?

17

MR. CRUZ: There are a host of instances in which

18

this Court has held that actual constitutional errors should

19

nonetheless not be addressed because the defendant has

20

procedurally defaulted that.

21

QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but is there

22

any -- any content to the manifest injustice exception in

23

your view?

24
25

MR. CRUZ: Absolutely there is.
case -­

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

The paradigmatic

1

QUESTION: Well, give me an example.

2

MR. CRUZ: -- is an individual was is innocent of

3

the crime.

4
5

QUESTION: Well, he's innocent of the crime he's in
-- in prison for.

6

MR. CRUZ: He is innocent only in the most

7

technical of legal sense.

8

word, he committed the theft, he committed the predicate

9

felonies -­

10
11

In the ordinary sense of the

QUESTION: No, but if the law were followed, he
would have been released a long time ago, would he not?

12

MR. CRUZ: If he had raised his objection.

13

QUESTION: What -- what actually -- what was he

14

charged with, Mr. Cruz?

15

and what were the recidivist offenses?

16

What was the substantive offense

MR. CRUZ: He was charged with theft, and that was

17

enhanced to a state jail felony because he had committed two

18

prior thefts.

19

aggravated because he was a habitual offender and had two

20

prior felony convictions.

21

they were sequential and it turned out that allegation was

22

incorrect.

And then upon sentencing, his sentence was

Now, the indictment alleged that

23

QUESTION: Well -­

24

QUESTION: They -- they were sequential.

25

one followed another.

I mean,

Isn't what it comes down to is that

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

he should have been -- he should have been given this longer

2

sentence for the second theft instead of for the third

3

theft?

4
5
6

MR. CRUZ: No, actually, Justice Scalia, the way
the statute reads -­
QUESTION: As I understand it, the -- the -- the

7

theft that -- that was used for recidivism occurred 3 days

8

after, right, the --

9
10

MR. CRUZ: It's a 3 -- it's a 3-day disparity.

The

first crime was delivery of amphetamines.

11

QUESTION: Yeah.

12

MR. CRUZ: And he committed that in 1988, but that

13

conviction did not become final until October 18th, 1991.

14

Three days before October 18th, 1991, he committed attempted

15

robbery, and the way the Texas statute reads, he has to

16

commit the second felony after the first felony conviction

17

becomes final.

18
19
20

QUESTION: But why did the first felony take so
long to become final?

It took -- you say it took 3 years?

MR. CRUZ: It -- it did.

I don't know the extent

21

to which that was discovery in the trial, but that -- that's

22

ultimately what the record reveal in terms of when that

23

conviction -­

24
25

QUESTION: At -- at trial, do you think the
prosecutor would have, if he had noted this error, have the

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

duty to call the attention of the trial judge before the

2

trial judge imposed sentence?

3

MR. CRUZ: Absolutely, absolutely.

4

QUESTION: But the trial obligation -- the trial

And -- and -­

5

lawyer's obligation to do justice is -- is somehow missing

6

in your office?

7

MR. CRUZ: The state has an obligation to be candid

8

with the court, so at any point in which the state became

9

aware of this error, the state would be obliged to inform

10

the court, but that's a very different thing to say that

11

when there is a procedural default, when the defendant has

12

not preserved his error, that the state should not act to

13

vindicate that procedural default.

14

value in protecting the procedural rules in the State of

15

Texas, and that value is not served.

16

this Court has said that the very narrow exception of actual

17

innocence should apply in very narrow circumstances.

18

this Court has ultimately engaged in a balancing, a

19

balancing that derives from prior language in the -- in the

20

Federal habeas -­

21

There is an important

I mean, ultimately,

So

QUESTION: Well, narrow circumstances, when the

22

record makes it perfectly clear that an error has been

23

committed and an innocent person is in jail, that's -- what

24

more do you need?

25

MR. CRUZ: The difficult -­

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: There aren't many cases like this.

2

MR. CRUZ: It is true that there are not many cases

3

where the state concedes error, but the difficulty with

4

pivoting the test on that is the basic operating premise of

5

every habeas petition.

6

is that the petitioner has valid claim and this Court has

7

not hesitated to allow far more significant claims not to be

8

addressed because of procedural default.

9

Where procedural default is raised

QUESTION: Yes, but usually the valid claim is some

10

procedural error in the trial, something of that character.

11

It's not that he's totally innocent and everybody agrees

12

he's totally innocent.

13

MR. CRUZ: This -- this Court has addressed

14

procedural default in the context of forced confessions, in

15

the context of statements without Miranda rights, in the

16

context of psychiatry -­

17

QUESTION: But that -- but -- but -- no, what you

18

need to satisfy Justice Stevens is -- is a case where the

19

mistake unquestionably caused the outcome of the -­

20

unquestionably caused the outcome of the trial to be wrong.

21

All of the ones you just mentioned, it may have caused it to

22

be wrong, may not have, you don't -- the jury might have

23

convicted him without the confession, et cetera, et cetera.

24

Do you have any cases where -- where, as here, there is no

25

doubt that the procedural default produced a different

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

outcome in the trial?

2

MR. CRUZ: We do not have any cases like that, but

3

that aspect simply goes to prejudice, and this Court has

4

repeatedly cautioned that the actual innocence exception

5

should not be used to transform cause and prejudice just to

6

prejudice.

There's no doubt that this error caused

7

prejudice.

The only question is if there was cause for not

8

raising it, and in terms of asking -- I mean, Justice

9

Stevens asked me about, is this a manifest injustice.

There

10

seems nothing on the face of it that is plain to me that

11

allowing an individual to be convicted and to remain

12

convicted and serve in jail or even be executed based on a

13

forced confession is somehow a lesser injustice than

14

allowing Mr. Haley to serve a sentence -­

15
16

QUESTION: I think it's a lesser injustice if he's
really guilty of the crime.

17
18

MR. CRUZ: But in this case, Mr. Haley is guilty of
the theft, he's guilty of the predicate offense -­

19
20

QUESTION: He is not guilty of what he's in prison
for.

21

MR. CRUZ: Only in the sense -­

22

QUESTION: And I don't think the 3 days is an

23

argument that has any merit.

24

if it was 10 years.

25

You'd make the same argument

You'd make the same argument.

MR. CRUZ: It is -- it is true that 3 days or 5

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

days or whatever does not matter.

2

are urging, is that Mr. Haley had multiple avenues to

3

challenge this.

4

could have challenged this on direct appeal.

5

What matters, and what we

He could have challenged this at trial.

He

QUESTION: If he could deliberately refuse to do it

6

in order to trap the state into some kind of mistake, is

7

this a case of, you know, in our original case that we talk

8

about gamesmanship and so on, do you think this is

9

gamesmanship on his part?

10

MR. CRUZ: You know, we don't have reason to

11

suggest that Mr. Haley in this instance was engaged in

12

gamesmanship with respect to this error, but the record is

13

susceptible to an interpretation that his counsel was

14

engaged in gamesmanship with respect to whether or not Mr.

15

Haley pleaded to the enhancements.

16

trial is Mr. Haley's attorney urged the trial court, my

17

client doesn't want to plead, please go ahead, he's not

18

going to plead.

19

and he immediately, on direct appeal that was his principal

20

challenge, and that is one possible interpretation of the

21

record is the counsel was attempting to sandbag.

22

a line of state court cases saying it was mandatory error

23

not to plead.

24
25

Because what happened at

The trial court did what the counsel asked

There was

QUESTION: Well, if the counsel sandbagged for the
purpose of getting a 16-year sentence instead of a 3-year

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

sentence, doesn't that demonstrate that he was incompetent?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. CRUZ: It may well, and I certainly wouldn't

4

urge that counsel engaged in good strategic decisions, but

5

it may have been a strategic decision with respect to urging

6

the court to commit an error under state law that caused the

7

counsel not to notice the disparities in the enhancements.

8

QUESTION: In one of the proceedings, Texas did

9

take the position that there -- this was not ineffective

10

assistance of counsel.

11

clear that you're not disputing that the -- that the

12

ineffective assistance of counsel claim is alive and well.

13

But there was a time you took a different view.

14

The reply brief I think makes it

MR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and we agree at

15

this point there is a very significant argument of

16

ineffective assistance of counsel, and I would note that the

17

court of criminal appeals in Texas has found ineffective

18

assistance of counsel in almost precisely the same

19

circumstance where a counsel failed to notice the non­

20

sequential nature of felonies used to enhance a habitual

21

offender in the decision of Ex parte Scott, which is found

22

at 581 S.W.2d 181.

23
24
25

If there are no further questions, I'd like to
reserve the balance of my time.
QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cruz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

5
6

MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

7

The actual innocence exception applies in the

8

extraordinary case where a prisoner has been convicted of a

9

crime that he did not commit.

The Court shouldn't extend

10

that narrow exception to the very different situation where

11

the prisoner is guilty of the crime of which he was

12

convicted.

13

QUESTION: Well, what should we do in this case

14

with someone who -- who is serving an unjust sentence under

15

the law?

16

MR. ROBERTS: Well -- well, Your Honor, even if

17

this Court holds that the actual innocence exception doesn't

18

apply to non-capital sentencing, respondent may well be

19

Your Honor.

2

QUESTION: Thank you.

3

QUESTION: Why not go to that first and tell them

4

to do that, because this is just very difficult, that that

5

would be the reason?

6

because actual innocence is simply a way at getting at

7

manifest injustice, I think, and a reason that this fits in

8

the manifest injustice is we feel differently about

9

substantive laws that govern how long a person is going to

The reason it would be difficult is

10

be in prison than we do about procedural laws, and

11

sentencing is an aspect of that.

12

But if you take that and say, look, this is an

13

absolute obvious case where there was just wrong sentencing,

14

it's not actual innocence, it's wrong sentencing, but it's

15

so obvious, it's so clear that this is just unjust.

16

we're down that path, I mean, how do we draw a line between

17

that and every sentencing error?

MR. ROBERTS: Well, the -- the Court certainly

could do that.

5

there's cause and prejudice and so you don't need to address

send it back, is that right?

11

MR. ROBERTS: It -- it -- yes, except that, you

12

know, certainly our -- our primary interest in the question

13

here is in the question that's divided the circuits and in

14

making clear that there isn't a broad actual innocence

exception as applied to -- to non-capital sentencing.

QUESTION: Perhaps when it's clear it will always

be the case that there's been ineffective assistance of

intervened?

21

How -- how could it be, you know, clear as day and

MR. ROBERTS: That -- that's -- that's right, Your

wouldn't need the actual innocence exception for that -- for

that circumstance.

MR. ROBERTS: Right.

QUESTION: -- argument.

3

MR. ROBERTS: We -- I -- I -- we think that it's a

4

question to be decided by the -- the court of appeals on -­

5

on remand, Your Honor, and the state had made arguments

6

about whether it was preserved or not.

7

asked me my opinion as to whether the -- whether the claim

8

was preserved, and in -- in our view it was, but that would

9

be a question for the lower court to -- to decide, and

Justice O'Connor

10

apparently the state is no longer arguing that -- that it

11

wasn't preserved.

12

As I said, our -- our -- the -- the issue that

13

we're primarily concerned about here is a broad extension of

14

the actual innocence exception to an erroneous prison term,

15

and that would involve substantial societal costs, because

16

the challenges to the findings -­

17

QUESTION: Would it involve all those costs if we

18

can find the exception to cases in which the state

19

acknowledges the error?

20
21

MR. ROBERTS: Well, that would certainly be a far
less problematic exception.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION: Would it be problematic if we limit it
that way?
MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, except to the extent
that it -- it extended -- extends actual innocence beyond an

offense which has a special constitutional status.

QUESTION: Are we free to write this code of

QUESTION: -- something which has never been done

11

in -- in a couple of hundred years is -- is -- is part of

12

due process?

13

MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor.

My understanding is

14

that the actual innocence exception and the procedural

15

default rules are court-made limitations on the jurisdiction

16

-- on the exercise of discretion by the Federal habeas

17

court, and so the court's exercising its -- its supervisory

18

authority over the courts.

19

QUESTION: No, but the Federal habeas court has to

20

be relying upon some law to -- to undo the state conviction,

21

right?

22
23

MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor.

There has to be an

underlying claim.

24

QUESTION: Yeah.

25

MR. ROBERTS: But we're talking here about the

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

actual innocence exception, which is a gateway to

2

consideration of that underlying claim.

3

still has to be an underlying constitutional claim, and -­

and that -­

QUESTION: Why is this qualitatively different from
the rule in Jackson against Virginia that if there's no

10

evidence to support the conviction, we set it aside, then

11

you presume the guy's innocent?

12

MR. ROBERTS: Well -- well -- Jack -- Jackson, Your

13

Honor, is based on Winship, which is based on the

requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the

elements of the crime.

The record establishes that one of

MR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I respectfully disagree

with that, Your Honor.

That -- the elements of the crime

have all been proved.

They're not -- they're not disputed.

What's disputed is -- is a factor leading to enhancement in

the sentence.

agree with you that the actual innocence exception applies

here.

or if we extended Apprendi to recidivism?

11

we would agree that the actual innocence exception applies

12

in this particular case.

13

QUESTION: Doesn't scare me.

14

MR. ROBERTS: But again, our concern is with broad

15

application of the actual innocence exception to sentencing

16

and to the many findings that are involved there, and the

17

fact is that the Court hasn't overruled Almendarez-Torres.

18

We're talking about even in this case just an erroneous

11

manifest.
MR. ROBERTS: I -- it -- what the Court has done in

12

-- in determining the application of exception is to weigh

13

the -- the degree of injustice that would be involved in

14

denying review against the substantial costs involved in -­

15

in reviewing claims when there's -- the prisoners

inexcusably failed to raise them in the proper forum and the

21

That's a difficult exercise?

MR. ROBERTS: I -- Your Honor, the -- the -- it --

22

it's certainly an unfairness, but there are substantial

costs to -- to extending it to these many -- there are many

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC M. ALBRITTON

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

MR. ALBRITTON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please
the Court:

8

This Court has repeatedly recognized that the -­

9

the systemic concerns that underpin the procedural default

10

doctrine must yield to the imperative of correcting a

11

fundamentally unjust incarceration, an incarceration that is

12

beyond the statutory maximum sentence, whether it be a

13

capital sentence or a non-capital sentence, is fundamentally

14

unjust.

15

capital sentence context and it should not do so today.

The Court has never limited this exception to a

16
17

QUESTION: Well, it has never extended it beyond
the capital sentence context either, has it?

18
19
20

MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.
However -­
QUESTION: And there is some suggestion in our

21

cases that other claims ought to be addressed before

22

resorting to that, such as inadequate assistance of counsel.

23

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I agree that this

24

Court's precedents suggest that ineffective assistance of

25

counsel, cause and prejudice, should be addressed first.

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

However, this Court has never expressly held that.

Your

2

Honor, in relation to the question that I've been asked

3

about, should this Court just remand for consideration of

4

the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, I would

5

respectfully suggest that that is not appropriate.

6

In this case, Your Honor, the petitioner -­

7

QUESTION: Why not?

8
9

You think that counsel's

performance was adequate here?
MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I think it was grossly

10

inadequate.

11

petitioner in this case, Your Honor, is only whether the

12

actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule

13

concerning Federal habeas corpus claims should apply to non-

14

capital sentence here.

15

However, the question presented by the

QUESTION: Yes, but if it's our view that the court

16

below addressed that out of order too soon when it had an

17

alternative, certainly we could vacate and remand.

18

MR. ALBRITTON: You could, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION: Yes.

20

MR. ALBRITTON: Again, I would respectfully suggest

21

that's inappropriate.

22

and presented the court with that particular question, that

23

is, whether or not the court should have reached cause and

24

prejudice first.

25

the court to consider that claim.

The State of Texas could have argued

However, the State of Texas did not ask

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: But we -- we haven't in -- in at least

2

two or three cases when we have a question of certiorari,

3

we've said that there's a logically preceding question that

4

has to be decided before we can get to that.

5

me this might be that kind of a case.

precedent, and I understand that the Court could -­

QUESTION: Well, I guess you'd like your client out
of jail?

10
11

So it seems to

MR. ALBRITTON: That's absolutely correct, Your
Honor, and the state didn't -­

12

QUESTION: Doesn't sound like it.

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION: Well, you -- you'd rather do it sooner

15

rather than later, right?

16

free rather than send it back down and try it all over

17

again?

You'd rather have us say let him

18

MR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION: That seems reasonable.

20

MR. ALBRITTON: If it's remanded, he's going to be

21

incarcerated while it goes back through the court of appeals

22

and through the district court, and if this Court decides

23

that, this issue, that it cannot reach the issue presented,

24

the Court can certainly dismiss this case as improvidently

25

granted and Mr. Haley will no longer have to suffer under

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

the danger of this clearly -­
QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, let me -- let me ask you

3

this. In this case there is a statute that would not have

4

allowed the additional sentence to be imposed unless these

5

things were sequential.

6

Suppose what you are -- we're dealing with was a real

7

sentencing factor of the sort that a judge can take into

8

account under a law which says the judge may sentence from

9

10 to 30 years, all right?

Suppose that wasn't the situation.

10

MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION: It's up to the judge.

And in sentencing

12

him to the maximum, the judge makes a mistake of fact.

13

is later found that when the judge said I'm giving him 30

14

years because, you know, he's been a really bad person in

15

light of this background, and it turns out that background

16

didn't exist, all right?

17

argument here?

18
19
20

It

Would you be making the same

MR. ALBRITTON: I absolutely would not, Your Honor.
As we've argued in our brief -­
QUESTION: That does make it sound like what this

21

is is Almendarez-Torres, that -- that -- the -- the

22

difference between the hypothetical I just posed to you and

23

this case is simply that the law would not allow the

24

additional time to be imposed unless the fact was found,

25

whereas in the discretionary case, the law would have

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

allowed it.

2

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, we do not believe that

3

the Court need reach Almendarez-Torres.

4

we propose is certainly consistent with this Court's Sixth

5

Amendment rule in Apprendi.

6

However, the rule

It's also consistent with -­

QUESTION: Well, how -- how do you limit it to that

7

kind of a situation then?

8

give me the answer that you've just given me, that even

9

though you -- you -- you show that the judge who imposed a

How -- how do you -- how do you

10

discretionary sentence was absolutely wrong for the basis on

11

which he imposed that discretionary sense, you wouldn't

12

allow that to be reviewed.

13

that?

14

Why -- what's the basis for

MR. ALBRITTON: Several reasons, Your Honor.

First

15

of all, this Court's decision in Sawyer v. Whitley

16

specifically adopted an eligibility test, and that

17

eligibility test draws the line at where that person is

18

statutorily eligible.

19

notion that it should consider discretionary factors in the

20

capital context mitigating evidence.

21

This Court specifically rejected the

Thus, Your Honor, our rule about statutory

22

eligibility is tethered specifically to the Court's ruling

23

in Sawyer.

24

propose is well-rooted in this Court's habeas doctrine

25

dating back to Townsend v. Burke, Your Honor.

Additionally, Your Honor, that rule that we

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

This Court

1

has recognized that a sentence that falls -- the severity of

2

a sentence that falls within a statutory range is not

3

amenable to habeas review.

4

Your Honor, of Harris v. the United States, where the issue

5

was whether Apprendi applied to mandatory minimums.

6

Court held -- actually, part of the opinion is a plurality

7

opinion, but the holding is that the -- it does not matter

8

if the sentence is more based on some false fact.

9

is, is it within range of punishment authorized by the

10
11

Additionally, the recent case,

This

The issue

legislature, Your Honor.
QUESTION: I understand that.

I just don't

12

understand why it makes any sense if you've shown and can

13

know for sure that the only reason the judge imposed the 30

14

years was that he believed a certain fact was true which in

15

fact was not true, and that is demonstrated, and he said,

16

I'm opposing 30 years because of this, otherwise, you know,

17

this would be a 10-year sentence.

18

much injustice there, it seems to me.

And I -- there's just as

19

MR. ALBRITTON: Well, Your Honor, the difference is

20

in an error in what constitutes a fundamental miscarriage of

21

justice, and we would respectfully suggest that when a

22

sentence is imposed outside of any range authorized by the

23

legislature, that is fundamentally unjust.

24
25

QUESTION: But the other could be, couldn't it?

I

mean, that's -- what I don't understand about this area, and

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

you've read the cases and so you may able to be clearer than

2

I am and can correct me, I've thought that the real key

3

concept is not actual innocence.

4

that to a sentence.

5

innocent of the sentence.

6

rather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest.

7

It's very hard to apply

You're guilty of the crime, you're not
That doesn't make sense, but

And so one could have manifest injustice in

8

millions of possible situations.

9

clarity as to it applies to in between the guideline but not

You don't need absolute

10

beyond the guideline, but the key word is manifest, and it

11

has to be unjust and injustice first and foremost has to do

12

with being behind bars when the law says you shouldn't be,

13

directly and simply, not through some procedural device.

14

So thinking about it in that way, I would like you

15

to tell me what cases of this Court stand as obstacles to

16

the way I'm thinking about it?

17

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I believe that Sawyer,

18

we believe that Sawyer v. Whitley stands as an obstacle to

19

that approach, because in Sawyer, Your Honor, the Court

20

specifically rejected the notion that factors that affect

21

the sentence within the discretion of the sentencing body

22

are not to be considered in the determination of whether or

23

not somebody -- or a petitioner is actually innocent of that

24

sentence.

25

QUESTION: You see what I -- what I'm basically

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

interested in is, is the -- the concept actual innocence

2

simply a subdivision of the broader concept manifest

3

injustice?

4

itself, where manifest, is a basis for doing whatever

5

happens in habeas law.

6

subdivision, I then would have a better handle on the case.

7

And so that actual innocence of the crime

And if I know whether that's a

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I -- it is our position

8

that innocence has been adopted as a touchstone for the

9

determination of whether or not there is a manifest

10

injustice.

11

takes into consideration, that focus on innocence takes into

12

proper consideration the systemic interest in federalism,

13

comity, and finality.

14

The Court has determined that that properly

Your Honor, although the -- the concept of

15

innocence of punishment is awkward and recognized, Mr. Haley

16

is actually innocent of the fact alleged that caused for the

17

sentence that is more than eight times the statutory -­

18

QUESTION: Everybody's going to say they're

19

actually innocent.

20

but, you know, a very high percentage of prisoners in prison

21

say, I was actually innocent, and the prosecution says, no,

22

you're not actually innocent.

23

excuse, actual innocence, and if in fact that's really an

24

excuse in respect to a sentence, then why wouldn't every

25

case be open to the Federal habeas judge relitigating the

All -- I mean, you know, not everybody,

So if that's really an

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

lawfulness of the conviction in terms of the evidence and

2

relitigating the sentence in terms of what was reasonable?

3

MR. ALBRITTON: Those concerns, Your Honor,

4

underpin the reason for the high standard of proof in the

5

first instance, that is, clear and convincing evidence.

6

Those concerns also, Your Honor, inform the reason for the

7

rule we proposed, and that is there is only a fundamental

8

miscarriage of justice when a sentence is imposed that under

9

the true facts no sentencing body, judge or jury, could have

10
11

ever done.
QUESTION: All right.

In your view, under the true

12

facts, a prisoner says the true facts are X, the state says

13

the true facts are not X, and what's supposed to happen?

14

MR. ALBRITTON: The court has to decide if the

15

petitioner has shown by clear and convincing evidence that

16

he or she, but for a constitutional violation, would not

17

have been eligible for that sentence.

18

QUESTION: So -- so in your -- in your view, every

19

crime in a state court and every sentence in a state court,

20

at least a big subset, are open to relitigation in the

21

Federal court on the standard of whether there is clear and

22

convincing evidence that adds the factual matters, it was

23

that the -- the state court was wrong?

24
25

MR. ALBRITTON: No, Your Honor, not a large subset,
only the subset of cases where the petitioner receives a

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

sentence for which he or she is statutorily ineligible.
QUESTION: In -- in your -- in your view, Mr.

3

Albritton, there's no requirement that this evidence be

4

newly discovered, I take it?

5

MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, it's a small subset of

7

the state court cases, but it's a -- it's a -- it's a total

8

-- it's not a subset at all of the Federal cases, right?

9

Because we have a guideline system where, by statute, you

10

are not allowed to impose any more than what the guidelines

11

permit, right?

12
13
14

MR. ALBRITTON: That's not actually entirely
accurate, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, unless you -- sure, you -- you can

15

make a finding that -- where that finding hasn't been made

16

that this is somehow extraordinary, you cannot, by law,

17

impose more than a certain amount of sentence.

18

MR. ALBRITTON: In the -- in the Federal context,

19

Your Honor, there are two things that are operating.

20

are the guidelines, but the second is the statutory range of

21

punishment.

22

application of the guidelines, that a sentence, up until and

23

including the statutory maximum under some circumstances is

24

appropriate.

25

One

The legislature has determined that within the

QUESTION: Oh no.

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: Yeah, but this guideline says the

2

statute says, Judge, you must apply the guideline range

3

unless.

4

arguably unless, okay?

Now, there are many situations where it isn't even

5

MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, sir.

6

QUESTION: So that means there is a statutory

7

requirement that the judge impose the guideline sentence,

8

four extra units or points if you had a gun, say.

9

prisoner says, I didn't have a gun.

The

The state says, I did

10

have a gun.

11

gun or didn't have a gun, whether the victim was seriously

12

hurt or only gravely hurt, whether there was a threat or a

13

brandishment or an actual use of the gun, all of which add

14

points, and what you're saying is all of those things would

15

be relitigated in a habeas court, as long as the prisoner

16

colorably can say, I have evidence that will show clearly

17

and convincingly the judge was wrong.

18

And now you want to relitigate whether he had a

MR. ALBRITTON: That is not correct, Your Honor.

19

Under the rule we propose, the Federal court would only have

20

to engage in this exercise if the petitioner could establish

21

by the requisite proof that he or she received a sentence

22

above the statutory maximum.

23

application of the guidelines and there can be factual

24

inaccuracies -­

25

While it may be error in the

QUESTION: No, you were saying that, but judge -- I

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

knew you were saying that, but I think Justice Scalia's

2

question was that he can't find, nor can I find, a logical

3

basis for making that distinction.

4

QUESTION:

That's the problem.

The sentence is unlawful if it goes

5

above the guidelines, which is why it can be set aside by

6

the appellate court.

It is unlawful.

7

MR. ALBRITTON: Your -- Your Honor, the difference

8

between unlawful and a fundamentally unjust is an important

9

distinction.

As this Court has historically held from the

10

early notions of habeas when, even when habeas review in the

11

first right, regardless of default, was much more

12

circumspect, the Court could always reach and always issue

13

the writ where a petitioner received a sentence that is

14

outside the statutory range.

15

a situation where there may be an error and there may be

16

some injustice, and a situation where the -- the injustice

17

is fundamental, Your Honor. That's the distinction.

18

So it's a difference in the -­

what establishes that you win on the constitutional point.

3

And in the -- in the death cases, there isn't that -- this

is not overlap, this is total coincidence.

5

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, in this Court's opinion

6

last week in Banks v. Dretke, the Court recognized, as it

7

had previously in Stickler v. Greene -- Strickler v. Greene,

8

that it is not unusual for the same facts to be used and an

9

overlap between those facts for the inquiry as to whether or

10

not the merits of the claim can be reached and the merits of

11

the claim.

12

Honor, the -- the same evidence was used to establish both

13

cause and prejudice, as well as the underlying merits of the

14

-- of the Brady violation.

15

As the Court held in Banks last week, Your

It's not surprising that the same evidence would

16

be involved in this situation, Your Honor, because, after

17

all, the inquiry is extremely similar, and that is the

18

innocence of the petitioner and whether or not the state

19

proved as a due process matter the allegations that it was

20

required to.

21

Your Honor, this -- this rule is a narrow rule for

the reasons we discussed.

12

Honor, this rule can -- the exception that we're talking

13

about can be administered with relative ease.

14

discussed in Sawyer, that's an important consideration in

15

determining whether or not the exception should be applied.

16

The issue presented to a Federal district judge of actual

17

innocence of a non-capital sentence is easier to determine

18

and it's more objective than, for instance, the

19

determination Federal district judges are called upon to

20

determine whether or not a petitioner is statutorily

21

eligible for the death penalty.

As the Court

must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner

constitutes a future danger.

12

not necessarily be ineffective assistance of counsel for one

13

reason at least, and that is, under Carrier, this Court held

14

that to rely on the ineffective assistance of counsel as

15

cause in Federal court, that claim had to have been raised

16

below in the state court.

17

And that answer is, there will not always

So there could be a scenario, this scenario, if

Mr. Haley had not properly raised ineffective assistance of

19

counsel below in state habeas or on state appeal as required

20

by state law, he would not be entitled to rely on that

21

ineffective assistance of counsel for cause in Federal

22

court, and so the court would be presented again with this

23

fundamentally unjust situation.

QUESTION: Well, and there are also cases under
Feretta where the defendant decides to represent himself.

MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.

Your

2

Honor, what is unusual about this case additionally, as

3

pointed out by the Court, the prosecutors -- we're -- we

4

don't suggest purposefully -- but the prosecutors

5

nevertheless caused the injustice in this case.

conviction or second prior offense was committed before -­

or after the first became final.

QUESTION: Well, are -- would you say, taking it

9
10

from there to the future dangerous, that the -- the

11

prosecutor was in error in the sense you refer to if he

12

alleged that the petitioner is going to be a future danger?

13

Are all these allegations just going to be turned out that

14

way?
MR. ALBRITTON: Not necessarily, Your Honor,

15
16

because a prosecutor in good faith could certainly believe

17

that the evidence would be sufficient to prove future

18

dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION: Well, are -- are you suggesting the

19
20

prosecutor in this case deliberately, when he alleged the

21

thing, knew that it was not -- wouldn't stand up?
MR. ALBRITTON: I'm not suggesting that, Your

22

25

Honor.

However -­
QUESTION: But then -- but then it really isn't a

basis for distinguishing the two examples I gave you for

45

just you to say, well, in the first case the prosecutor

acted in good faith.

MR. ALBRITTON: Even if the prosecutor did not do

this intentionally, Your Honor, the error and the injustice

originated with the prosecutor.

Not only did the prosecutor

allegation of future dangerous too.

9

alleged in the complaint, isn't it?

10

You have the -- that's

MR. ALBRITTON: If future dangerousness is alleged,

11

in reviewing the evidence there's a good faith belief to

12

believe that there -- that person constitutes a future

13

danger, that would be different than in this situation where

14

all the prosecutor had to do was look at its state's exhibit

could have discerned -­

have done that too, I suppose.
MR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, and he should have,

20

Your Honor.

21

reasons for the narrow fundamental miscarriage of justice

22

exception is this notion of gamesmanship, and as pointed out

23

in the briefs, it is our position that there would never be

24

any rational incentive for a petitioner to engage in

25

gamesmanship when there was conclusive evidence that

Additionally, Your Honor, one of the -- the

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

established he or she was not statutorily eligible for the

2

sentence.

3

Mr. Haley's case is a perfect example.

4

though Mr. Haley was diligent and filed his state writ very

5

shortly after the court of criminal appeals in Texas denied

6

discretionary review, he's ended up spending 4 years more in

7

prison than he was even authorized for under the statute.

state's interest in this case, it is the Federal habeas

10

court that in actuality is vindicating the Texas substantive

law.

12

interest of the state in its procedural laws.

13

recognition indicates that, in effect, there's a wash of the

14

interest here, which would not undermine the application of

15

the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception in this

16

context.

17

Now that does not mean, of course, that there is no
However, that

QUESTION: And it's -- it's a little, I suppose,

18

patronizing in -- in some sense for us to say that the

19

district courts, Federal courts are vindicating Texas'

20

interest in its own laws, although it's pretty obvious Texas

21

doesn't care about it in this case.

22

MR. ALBRITTON: Certainly the -- the state doesn't

23

seem to care about that interest with its position here.

24

However, I don't think it's -- we do not think it's

25

patronizing, Your Honor, because the Court is always

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

required to balance the equities of the situation and

2

determine whether the exception to the procedural default

3

rule should apply.

4

quite relevant that you're discussing -- and it would be so

5

in all cases such as this that, under the rule we propose,

6

because the sentence would always be outside the range

7

authorized by the legislature for this particular conduct.

8

And in this case, we think that it is

Your Honors, in relation, briefly here at the end

9

to Almendarez-Torres, we agree with the Solicitor General

10

that if Almendarez-Torres does not control, then this case

11

is -- is very easy and there need not be any application of

12

Sawyer, and that is because, as I said earlier, he would be

13

actually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by

14

habitual offender.

15

Torres is not controlling because in this case there is an

16

additional -- there is something else that must be proven in

17

addition to the fact of the prior convictions, and that is

18

the date of the commission of the second prior felony

19

offense.

As pointed out in our brief, Almendarez-

For that reason -­

20

QUESTION: Well, isn't that pretty much the tail

21

wagging the -- the tail wagging the dog, I mean, if -- if

22

you say that the date of the offense is -- is a separate

23

element?

24

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, the State of Texas in

25

its judgment specifically required not only the -- in this

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

circumstance, not only the existence of two prior felony

2

convictions, but that the second was committed after, excuse

3

me, the conviction of the first.

4

QUESTION: Yes, but you're -- you're telling us

5

that the -- that the existence of the prior offense is not

6

an element, right, but -- but that the date of the prior

7

offense is -- is -­

8
9

MR. ALBRITTON: That -- that is incorrect, Your
Honor.

What we allege is that it is not the focus on the

10

sequence of the convictions.

11

shorthand to describe the -- when the second offense was

12

committed, and the date of commission of that offense is

13

something separate and apart from the fact of those prior -­

14

of that prior conviction.

15

respectfully suggest that takes this outside of Almendarez-

16

Torres, and therefore the Court can -- can determine that

17

Mr. Haley is actually innocent of the enhanced offense of

18

theft by habitual offender.

When sequence is used, it is

So, Your Honor, we would

Finally, Your Honor, in conclusion, I would

20

respectfully request the Court not to remand to the State of

21

Texas -- excuse me, to the courts below, unless it reaches

22

the question presented and decides it contrary to the Fifth

23

Circuit.

24

assistance of counsel claim should have -- or cause and

25

prejudice should have been reached first, since it was not

that the state concedes is unlawful, and as the court

advised -- as the state advised the district court, if this

6

Court were to reverse, it intends to put Mr. Haley back in

7

prison for an additional 10 years that it specifically

8

admits is unlawful and not authorized by the legislature,

9

and a remand presumably would result in the same sort of

injustice visited upon Mr. Haley by the state.

11

For those reasons, Your Honor, I respectfully

12

suggest that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth

13

Circuit and hold that Mr. Haley has sufficiently established

14

that he is actually innocent, reach the merits of the claim,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'd like

to quickly revisit an exchange Justice Scalia had with Mr.

Albritton concerning Almendarez-Torres, and make the point

24

that even if this Court were at some future date to decide

25

to overrule Almendarez-Torres, which I don't believe is

the grounds for granting habeas that a sentence is, quote,

10

in excess of the maximum authorized by law.

11

It is not in 2254.

12

2254 with respect to a state conviction is if someone is

13

held in custody of violation of the laws or Constitution of

14

the United States.

15

That's in 2255.

The only ground for granting habeas in

And so it is altogether possible that this Court

16

could decide at some future date to -- to overrule

17

Almendarez-Torres and then yet nonetheless decide that in

18

looking to the ends of justice that now repeal language from

19

the habeas statute, that there is not an obligation to

excuse procedural default for every single conceivable

sentencing error.

limited need for extending the actual innocence exception to
