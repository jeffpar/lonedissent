Mr. Knorr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KNORR, III

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. KNORR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In its decisions a few years ago in the Ellerth

12

and Faragher cases, this Court held that where a

13

supervisor has created a hostile work environment by acts

14

of sexual harassment, the liability of the employer is not

15

strict, but rather is subject to an affirmative defense

16

which centers around the opportunities provided by the

17

employer for corrective or preventive action.

18

The question here is whether that affirmative

19

defense should continue to be available where there is an

20

allegation that the hostile work environment resulted in a

21

constructive discharge, and we submit that it should.

22

In our view there is nothing about a claim of

23

constructive discharge that changes the Ellerth-Faragher

24

analysis of hostile work environments.

25

acts which create a hostile work environment don't produce

A supervisor's

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

strict liability because they are not acts of agency; that

2

is, they are not the acts of the employer.

3

bear the imprimatur of the employer.

4

by the employer, and they are not the sorts of things

5

which could only be done by somebody invoking the

6

authority of the employer.

7

QUESTION:

They don't

They aren't ratified

Mr. Knorr, I'm -- I had a hard time,

8

in reading the briefs on this case, figuring out what we

9

ought to do with the suggestion that there's a

10

constructive discharge theory.

11

Court has ever weighed in on that.

12

labor law context I guess.

13

MR. KNORR:

14

QUESTION:

Now, I don't think this
It comes out of the

Yes.
I'm wondering, you know, in -- in

15

Ellerth and Faragher, what we said was that when no

16

tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer

17

may raise an affirmative defense to the liability.

18

wondering if we shouldn't just try to look at the facts in

19

this case and ask whether what the supervisors did

20

amounted to a tangible employment action and that would

21

answer the -- the question.

22

So I'm

I -- I don't know that viewing it through the

23

lens of a constructive discharge is helpful.

What she

24

says is that the supervisors -- that she had taken tests

25

to qualify for a promotion, that the supervisors had

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

hidden the results of those tests and had thereby

2

prevented any promotion, and that there was a false arrest

3

I guess.

4

actions occurred, and if so, whether they amounted to a

5

tangible employment action?

6

question?

7

Now, why shouldn't we just look to see if those

MR. KNORR:

Wouldn't that answer the

Justice -- Justice O'Connor, if we

8

haven't made this clear, then the Court has my sincerest

9

apologies because that is exactly what we suggest the

10

Court should do.

11

supervisor amounted -- which -- which provoked the

12

constructive discharge amounted to a tangible employment

13

action, then there is no affirmative defense.

14

If the underlying actions of the

QUESTION:

But -- but Justice O'Connor is going

15

a little bit further than that.

I think she is suggesting

16

that there cannot be a constructive discharge without some

17

tangible employment action because constructive discharge

18

itself attributes to the employer the desire to get rid of

19

the employee, and that desire cannot simply be

20

communicated through some lower -- lower people.

21

Now, maybe the -- the tangible employment action

22

is the refusal of the employer to respond when the obscene

23

actions of -- of the -- of the coworkers here are brought

24

to the employer's attention.

25

that qualify as tangible action in -- in your part -- in

That would be I -- would

1

your estimation?

2

MR. KNORR:

I'm not sure if it would be tangible

3

action or not, but it would certainly indicate that if the

4

employer didn't respond, that it was in some sense

5

ratifying or approving what it has done.

6

QUESTION:

I mean, the point is, how can you

7

have a constructive discharge?

8

discharge is the employer.

9

employer.

The only person that can

You have to pin it on the

I don't know how -- how subordinates alone can

10

-- can produce a situation that amounts to a constructive

11

discharge.

12

MR. KNORR:

That, Justice Scalia, is partly true

13

and it partly is not true because the precise elements of

14

what you need to prove to -- to get a constructive

15

discharge vary quite widely from court to court.

16

some courts what you say is quite accurate.

17

be some proof of an intention on the part of the employer,

18

even if it's only through a failure to respond to a

19

complaint, to get rid of the employee.

20

courts -- and -- and this includes the Third Circuit -­

21

that is not really the case.

22
23

QUESTION:

And in

There has to

But in other

be?

24

MR. KNORR:

QUESTION:

There is a right answer to this,

1
2

isn't there?
MR. KNORR:

Well, that's not a question that

3

we've presented or that the court has addressed.

In -- in

4

our view, the right answer to that would be, yes, you have

5

to in some sense prove employer intent -­

6

QUESTION:

7

say the -- the standards vary.

8

that -- for a -- that recognizes constructive discharge

9

that does not require the employee to prove that the

10

employee acted reasonably in relation to avenues for

11

redress, filing grievances and so on?

12

-- is there any jurisdiction in which the employee's

13

reasonableness in trying to adjust things before leaving

14

is not an element of the -- of the claim?

15

Is there -- is there -- you -- you

MR. KNORR:

Is there any jurisdiction

Is -- is there any

I think that the short answer to

16

that question is yes.

There are such jurisdictions and

17

they include the Third Circuit, but I need to be a little

18

more expansive than that because in all jurisdictions,

19

including -- including the Third Circuit, there is an

20

inquiry into whether the employee acted reasonably, but -­

21

and in some jurisdictions, that inquiry is directed to -­

22

to the question of whether the employee tried to resolve

23

this -- this matter internally.

24

including the -- the Third Circuit, the inquiry into

25

employee reasonableness is tied only to the question of

In other jurisdictions,

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

how bad were the conditions; that is, were these

2

conditions so bad that a reasonable person would quit?

3

And in that inquiry, it may or may not even be relevant

4

whether the employee tried to -- to resolve it internally.

5

QUESTION:

But it was in the Third Circuit

6

because the judge somewhere in that long opinion did say

7

that the evidence that she had complained -- that that

8

would be relevant, but not essential evidence to show the

9

reasonableness of her reaction treating this conduct as a

10

discharge.

11

MR. KNORR:

I'm not sure the court went that

12

far.

13

relevant and in -- in a later -­

14
15

The court said that -- that it might conceivably be

It may be different -­

And it -- I'm sorry.
-- in different places because this

opinion tended to say everything at least twice.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. KNORR:

My recollection is that the court

21

didn't give very much specific direction on what should

22

come in on a remand in this case.

23

the court of appeals was quite clear that it was up to

24

district courts to decide whether all, some, or none of

25

evidence about anti-harassment policies and remedial

As a general matter,

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

MR. KNORR:

And that -­

Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.
Did you finish your answer? I -- I

beg your pardon.

6

MR. KNORR:

If -- if I could.

7

And that inquiry, in turn, is tied simply into

8

the question of how bad were the conditions.

That is, if

9

the conditions were bad enough, it doesn't matter if there

10

was an anti-harassment policy.

11

were remedial efforts made.

12

it all is -- while it is all -- while it is always phrased

13

in terms of employee reasonableness, can really be

14

directed to quite different things.

15

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter if there

So the -- the inquiry, while

May I ask you also to clarify?

That

16

-- you gave Justice O'Connor an answer that surprised me

17

because she said let's stick to this case, and she said

18

that action involving the not -- not letting her have her

19

papers, and then the arrest, that looking at those facts,

20

could that be -- is that the way the Court should go about

21

it.

22

in this case.

But the district judge gave summary judgment for you
Is that not so?

23

MR. KNORR:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.
So, then on Justice O'Connor's facts,

there would be no question whether she acted reasonably,

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether it was equivalent, whether it was equivalent to a

2

tangible employment action.

3

MR. KNORR:

In terms of this particular case, in

4

our view it is a little bit -- it -- it is too late in the

5

day to reopen the inquiry as to whether the underlying

6

actions of the supervisors were or were not tangible.

7

That -- that is something that should have been raised at

8

the district court level when we raised the affirmative

9

defense.

What I -- what I -­
QUESTION:

But there was no trial.

just summary judgment.

12

MR. KNORR:

This was

There was no evidence submitted.

There -- well, there was no trial.

13

There was certainly evidence submitted, and it seems to us

14

that when we as the defendants say we are entitled to the

15

affirmative defense and we are moving for summary judgment

16

on it, it's incumbent on the plaintiff at that point to

17

say, no, you aren't entitled even to assert the

18

affirmative defense because we have this action and this

19

action and this action which were taken, which are

20

tangible employment actions, and therefore you aren't even

entitled to the affirmative defense.

theory of the case should be.

something like this?

MR. KNORR:

Is that your position?

No, Justice Kennedy, and I -- I

guess I -­
QUESTION:

It sounds like a good position.

Why

isn't that your position?

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. KNORR:

Our -- our position really is that

18

this case and -- and hostile environment cases generally

19

which are alleged to be constructive discharges are just

20

like Ellerth, that what you do is you look at what the

21

supervisor did to the employee to provoke the discharge,

22

and if those actions were hostile work environment, if

23

they were -- if they were -- I hate to use the word

24

merely, but if they were acts of sexual harassment, not

25

arising to tangible actions, if the employee had simply

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sued on the hostile work environment, we'd have an

2

affirmative defense.

3

or it shouldn't change because there is also a claim that

4

it was so bad that I had to quit.

5

QUESTION:

Our position is that doesn't change

How is that different from the

6

formulation that one component in almost all cases of

7

constructive discharge or tangible employment action,

8

whatever you want to call it, is the existence or

9

nonexistence of avenues for redress, and if they did

10

exist, whether the employee took reasonable steps to

11

follow them.

12

MR. KNORR:

If that were true across the board,

13

Justice Kennedy, there would be no difference.

14

you're entirely correct.

You're -­

Then why --

QUESTION:

No, no please.

19

I was -- why isn't the way to simplify the

20

problem and decide this case for us to say in order to

21

have constructive discharge, there has got to be the

22

element that Justice Kennedy just described, i.e., avenues

23

of redress, reasonableness on the part of the employee in

24

availing or perhaps in some cases not availing of them?

25

If that element is shown, then there is no point in

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

recognizing the affirmative defense because that is in

2

pretty clear contradiction to one element of the

3

affirmative defense.

4

fairly simple body of law.

5

appropriate way for us to go?

And -- and that would make for a
Why -- why isn't that the

6

MR. KNORR:

I think that is certainly a way to

7

go, Justice -- Justice Souter.

8

clear across the board in all jurisdictions that to prove

9

a constructive discharge, you do have to have made some

If it were -- if it were

10

effort to invoke a remedial process, just as with the

11

affirmative defense, then that would certainly -- that

12

would certainly satisfy our concerns.

13

QUESTION:

Why does a -- why does a plaintiff

14

bring a constructive discharge suit instead of just a

15

regular sexual harassment suit?

16

of getting more damages?

17

MR. KNORR:

18

QUESTION:

19

21
22

Is it -- is it a matter

Is that the reason for -­

Yes, I think so.
-- for couching it in those -- in

those terms?
MR. KNORR:

Yes, because then you've got the -­

the lost wages and so forth for -- for the entire time.
QUESTION:

I'm troubled by that too.

I mean, I

23

don't understand why we're using that term at all in light

24

of the case background here.

25

terms of allegations of sexual harassment and tangible

Why isn't it couched in

2

MR. KNORR:

That is -- that is the way we think

3

that it should be couched, Justice O'Connor.

The -- the

use of the constructive discharge is -- was the

plaintiff's choice, of course, and -­

same as an actual discharge.

15

would be fine if you said, plaintiff, you're in this

situation, you're claiming constructive discharge, you

come in and -- and, in effect, negate what would otherwise

18

be the affirmative defenses.

19

The question is how do you define

And you said, in response to Justice Souter, that it

QUESTION:

But they -­

Well, I -- I thought two circuits

20

hold that a constructive discharge is never a tangible

21

employment action.

22

I mean, that's part of the problem.

MR. KNORR:

Yes.

That's -- that is correct.

23

And -- and frankly, I don't think that is a correct

24

analysis either.

25

sense a constructive discharge can't ever be a tangible

Our view is that a -- a -- in a -- in a

1

employment action because it isn't an action at all.

2

just a construct.

3

is that the supervisor did, and if that's a tangible

4

employment action, then there is no affirmative defense,

5

whether -- whether or not the employer is -­

6

It's

Our view is you look at -- to what it

QUESTION:

But there's an -- there's an

7

intermediary situation and that's the one where there is a

8

tangible action like you get demoted or you get

9

transferred to a -- a worse position.

And that -- that's

10

one category.

11

constantly and that amounts to constructive discharge.

12

Another is they did take a tangible action against me,

13

they didn't discharge me, but they were so bad in

14

harassing me and in this demotion, that it amounted to a

15

constructive discharge.

16

discharge is the label used for that too, isn't it?

17

Another category is you say I was harassed

MR. KNORR:

That -- that constructive

It can be.

An employee can

18

certainly say I was -- I was subjected to a humiliating

19

demotion and that was so bad -­

MR. KNORR:

So I quit.
-- that I quit.

Had she just sued

22

just on the demotion, clearly a tangible employment

action, and we would have no affirmative defense.

24

also goes on to say, and it was so bad that I quit, I

think we again should not have the affirmative defense.

QUESTION:

But the Seventh Circuit goes the

other way on that.

3

MR. KNORR:

Yes, they do.

Yes, they do.

4

And by the same token, if the employee simply

5

says, I was sexually harassed and subjected to a hostile

6

work environment, we would have the affirmative defense.

7

If she goes on to say, and -­

8

QUESTION:

9

Is that true even if the person who

did the harassment and so forth but did not otherwise take

10

a tangible action, was the president of the company and

11

said -- made the -- the workplace impossible to have it

12

for the employee and she quits.

13

employment action?

14

MR. KNORR:

Would that be a tangible

I don't think you'd reach that

15

question, Justice Stevens.

16

into play there is the idea that there are -- there are

17

some people in every organization who are so high up that

18

they are proxies for the employer itself.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNORR:

21

QUESTION:

I -- I think what would come

Right.
And so it -- it really is -­
And that person who's a proxy does

not commit a -- make a -- a tangible decision, doesn't

fire her.

24

Would that be actionable or not?

25

He just makes it impossible for her to work.

MR. KNORR:

That would be actionable because it

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is the action of the employer, and you don't even have to

2

get into the question of whether it is an agent of the

3

employer or not.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Even though it was a tangible -- even

though it was a constructive discharge.
MR. KNORR:

I think at that point it -- that is

7

all irrelevant because what you're talking about is the

8

act of someone who is the proxy of the employer and

9

therefore the employer is responsible for it.

10

Mr. Chief Justice, if I could reserve the

balance of my time.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MR. GORNSTEIN:

it only when the constructive discharge comes about as a

22

result of an official company act, such as a demotion.

23

the constructive discharge comes about as a result of a

24

supervisor's creation of a hostile environment, then the

25

employer has an affirmative defense and can show that the

If

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

plaintiff unreasonably bypassed available opportunities

2

for correction.

3

Now, the requirement of an official company act

4

as a predicate for strict liability comes from the Court's

5

decision in Ellerth and is supported by two important

6

considerations.

7

First, a company act is the kind of act that is

8

likely to be documented and subject to higher levels of

9

review, and so it's the kind of act over which the

10

employer can exert the most control.

11

potential to control makes it fair to hold the employer

12

strictly liable, even if in a particular case the employer

13

would otherwise be able to show that it acted reasonably

14

and the plaintiff did not.

15

And that heightened

It -- it -- second of all, furthering title

16

VII's -- the -- recognizing the affirmative defense when

17

there's not an official company act, furthers title VII's

18

prophylactic purposes because it gives the employer an

19

extra incentive to create policies that will help to

20

prevent discrimination from occurring in the first place

21

and it gives employees an added incentive to complain

22

before problems become Title VII violations.

23

QUESTION:

Well, how do you think we should

24

analyze this particular case in light of the Third

25

Circuit's treatment?

How does this fit into your formula?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, in this -- in this case

2

you might want to -- what I was going to go on to say is

3

you might want to initially decide the logically

4

antecedent question of what it takes to -- to make out a

5

constructive discharge claim in the first place.

6

you did that, you should say that to prove constructive

7

discharge, a plaintiff has to show that there's no

8

reasonable other alternative other than to resign.

9

plaintiff who has unreasonably bypassed an available

And if

And a

10

opportunity for correction can't make out a constructive

11

discharge claim in the first place.

12

QUESTION:

When you -- when you posit that

13

reasonableness requirement, I take it you -- you mean to

14

include that the employee must show either that the

15

employee reasonably availed herself or himself of whatever

16

grievance procedure there was or at least had a reasonable

17

basis for not doing so.

18
19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That -- that's correct, Justice

Souter.

20

QUESTION:

Now, if -- if you do that, what is -­

21

what is left of the affirmative defense, whether there was

22

-- whether there was a supervisor involved or not, because

23

the affirmative -- as I understand the affirmative

24

defense, the affirmative defense is inconsistent with that

25

showing?

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Souter, you are right

2

with respect to the constructive discharge claim itself;

3

that is, proving the constructive discharge will

4

necessarily negate the affirmative defense to the

5

constructive discharge claim.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But that -­

So why don't we stop right there?
Because it doesn't necessarily

8

negate -- proving the constructive discharge doesn't

9

necessarily negate the affirmative case -- defense to the

10

claim of a hostile work environment that preceded the

11

constructive discharge.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but the hostile work environment

13

claim -- and if -- if we're going to recognize

14

constructive discharge, hostile work environment I -- I

15

presume has been subsumed under constructive discharge

16

because constructive discharge says, hostile environment

17

plus something more.

18

something more.

19

something more, you've got to prove, as you said,

20

something which is inconsistent with the affirmative

21

defense.

22

And we've been describing the plus

And -- and in order to prove the plus

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Let me try to explain to you how

23

this could come up.

You could have a situation in which

24

at the moment of resignation, the plaintiff was reasonable

25

in believing that there was nothing she could do other

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

than to resign and reasonable in bypassing the available

2

procedures at the moment of resignation, therefore, could

3

prove a constructive discharge.

4

case that at a prior point in time, she would have been

5

unreasonable in failing to complain about the harassment

6

and therefore be vulnerable to the affirmative defense on

7

the hostile environment claim even though she's proven her

8

constructive discharge.

9

QUESTION:

But it may have been the

I understand what you're -- I

10

understand what you're saying, but I -- I would suppose

11

that if -- if the evidence shows that it was -- that there

12

was a point at which she could have resolved this or at

13

least a point at which it would have been reasonable to

14

pursue grievances and so on to resolve it, and she didn't

15

do it, that she's going to lose.

16

-- I don't -- I don't see how she's going to get to the

17

point that you describe.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

In other words, if -- I

The -- the way that she would

19

get to the point that I described, Justice Souter, is if

20

you had an escalating kind of harassment and at the last

21

act of harassment, it would have been reasonable that -­

22

for the plaintiff to leave at that point -- let us say the

23

supervisor does a lot of things, and then on the last act

24

says, if you come back tomorrow, you're dead.

25

QUESTION:

I -- I see your point.

I -- I have

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

one question in response to the point, and that is, if -­

2

if we -- if we construct a system that -- that recognizes

3

the possibility that -- that you just described, are we

4

going to have a system that is just so darned complicated

5

that it's going to be too difficult to administer?

6

In other words, every case is going to involve

7

allegations of what you just say, denials of those

8

allegations.

9

shouldn't we simply say that if you can prove the

In order to have an administrable system,

10

constructive discharge, if the -- if the element includes

11

the unreasonableness on grievance, no affirmative defense,

12

and just get over with it simply because otherwise it

13

would be just too complicated a system?

14

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Souter, it would be a

15

simpler system, but the -- the system we are proposing

16

really is just superimposing on this problem the same

17

structure the Court created in Ellerth and Faragher.

18

Court could have devised a simpler rule in Ellerth and

19

Faragher.

That's what I want to know.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

We would say that you would

MR. GORNSTEIN:

leading up to the arrest, and that the arrest might be -­

that leads to strict liability.

QUESTION:

How -- how could the -- how could the

arrest by an official company act?

22

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It could be an official company

grant of authority from the employer to the supervisor and

25

it's only the sort of thing that a supervisor could do.

You don't -­

that this action you're concerned about is not an employer

It is -- it is quite apart from

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, I think it could

10

be that you're right about that, but it also may be that

11

it's the type of action where the -- the person was

12

wearing both hats, as a supervisor and as a law

13

enforcement officer, and that it was the -- only the sort

14

of thing that a supervisor could have done.

15

saying is that should be fleshed out.

16

And all we're

If you don't think that should be fleshed out,

17

if the Court didn't think that that was a possibility,

18

then there wouldn't be the need for the -- the remand.

19

You could just decide it without a remand and -- and

20

reverse on the grounds -- to get back to Justice Souter's

21

point, you still, under my scenario have to get to the

22

question of whether a constructive discharge is a tangible

23

employment action.

QUESTION:

Suppose that the tangible employment

action -- say, a demotion or an arrest or a firing -­

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

could have been avoided if the employee had been prompt

2

and reasonable in pursuing avenues for relief.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

QUESTION:

In that -­

And a reasonable employee in that

5

position would have done that and they didn't do it.

6

it escalates.

7

Then

Then there's the discharge.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Then in that situation, there's

8

a constructive discharge, but there's a potential defense

9

to the harassment claim that would depend on whether the

10

constructive discharge is itself a tangible employment

11

action.

12

brought about by an official company act, such as a

13

demotion.

15

defense for the constructive discharge because that's been

16

negated by proving constructive discharge.

17

affirmative defense for the prior acts leading up to it

18

that are framed as a claim about hostile environment.

19

There would be an affirmative defense to the hostile

environment claim if the hostile environment culminates in

a constructive discharge that's not effected by an

22

official company act.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. BAILEY

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. BAILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Pursuant to title VII, the general rule has been

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that employers are liable for the discriminatory acts of

2

their supervisors.

3

constructive discharge is the equivalent of a formal

4

discharge.

5

The question presented is whether a

One of the greatest difficulties in dealing with

6

the law that we're addressing today is one of semantics.

7

A formal discharge is the equivalent of a constructive

8

discharge by definition.

9

methodology.

It is a -- it is a matter of

10

The United States and the petitioner would have

11

this Court define the culpability of the employer for the

12

supervisor's acts as a matter of official act.

13

this Court down an incredibly complex road of -- of

14

definitional problems.

15

That leads

If the Court goes back to Meritor, the Chief

16

Justice's opinion, where the Court held clearly there is

17

no automatic liability for the employer's being

18

responsible for the wayward acts, clearly outside the

19

scope of employment, clearly not authorized, but we're not

20

going to find a -- a -- an automatic liability.

21

What the United States wants to do and why the

22

respondent believes that the Third Circuit -- that the

23

Third Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case properly

24

is to devise a general rule and underline if proven, if

25

the constructive discharge is proven, then the obvious

It's a tangible employment action.
QUESTION:

Well, but that's the whole question

3

that is presented in the -- in the question here.

4

I don't think you can just say it's obvious.

MR. BAILEY:

I mean,

Well, it's -- it's the -- to go

6

back to some of the questions that Justice Souter was -­

7

Souter was raising, the issue of the -- of the

8

constructive discharge, when proven, reaches a point as a

9

practical matter in litigation that the affirmative

10

defense is no longer viable.

And the issue in the

11

question presented is when a -- if -- if we stick to that

12

issue, is that is a constructive discharge a tangible

13

employment action.

14

assume that a constructive discharge, if proven, is an

15

official company act?

Conversely, isn't it reasonable to

QUESTION:

But isn't it the same?

17

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

Why is that?

It seems to

18

me what you're saying is that up to the point where the

19

harassment reaches such a level that a reasonable person

20

would leave, up to that point, the individual could not

21

sue the employer because the employer is not responsible

22

for it.

23

even worse and the person says, I'm going to leave,

24

suddenly the employer is automatically responsible for it.

25

Why -- why -- that doesn't make any sense at all.

But suddenly when it goes over the edge and it's

Now, if that's not availing herself -- that's a
