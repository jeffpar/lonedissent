CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Feinerman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY FEINERMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. FEINERMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
A Lombard informational checkpoint was designed

10
11

to find witnesses to a specific known crime.

The

12

principal question here is whether the checkpoint is per

13

se invalid under the Fourth Amendment or whether it's

14

governed by the Brown balancing test.

15

of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, which generally

16

is measured by balancing the Government interest advanced

17

by a seizure against the intrusion on the individual and

18

this Court has held that road - roadway checkpoints,

19

including those that serve a law enforcement purpose, are

20

governed by the balancing factors set forth in Brown v.

21

Texas.

Now, the touchstone

Now, in Edmond, an exception was carved for a

22
23

certain category of law enforcement checkpoints, those

24

that are designed to advance the general interest in crime

25

control.

The Court held in Edmond that crime control

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

checkpoints are not subject to a balancing analysis, but

2

rather are per se invalid.

3

this case held that informational checkpoints, including

4

the Lombard checkpoint here, fall within that general

5

crime control exception.

6

invalidity under the Fourth Amendment is very strong

7

medicine and ought to be reserved for exceptional

8

circumstances, and those circumstances -

The Illinois Supreme Court in

That was an error.

Per se

QUESTION: Well, I suppose we'd have to decide

9
10

here not only whether it was per se invalid, but whether

11

it was reasonable under any other standard.

12

MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

13

QUESTION: And let me ask you, is it often that

14

roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?
MR. FEINERMAN: I - I would rely on the amicus

15
16

briefs submitted by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of

17

Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and they -

18

they have informed the Court that roadblocks are not used

19

frequently, rather they are used judiciously in order to

20

solve certain QUESTION: This was a little odd.

21
22

It was a week

later?

23

MR. FEINERMAN: It was a week later, but there

24

was a very good reason why the checkpoint was set up at

25

that particular place and at that particular time.

There

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was a fatal hit-and-run accident at about midnight on a

2

Friday night.

3

pedestrian witnesses, and the Lombard police reasonably

4

concluded that, because people's driving habits, or at

5

least some people's driving habits might be regular, that

6

some of the drivers that were there on the night in

7

question would also be driving the same route at the same

8

time at the same place one week later, and we -

9

There were no witnesses, at least

QUESTION: The - the - you - you said that they

10

had to be used judiciously and that's a good word, but our

11

- do our precedents in this area generally say, well, we

12

defer to the good judgement of the police, they won't use

13

them too often.

14

we allow this, we're going to have roadblocks every other

15

- every day, every other street and in part that's

16

hyperbole, but on the other hand, it does caution us that

17

there should be some limiting principle and I just don't

18

know if our precedents would support us in adopting your

19

word, oh, if it's used judiciously.

20

The Illinois Supreme Court said, oh, if

MR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's used judiciously for a

21

number of reasons.

One are the resource limitations.

22

These kinds of roadblocks are very resource-intensive.

23

There's also the prudential limits that the police

24

departments place upon themselves.

25

appear too intrusive to the public and this is a - a minor

They don't want to

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

inconvenience and the QUESTION: What if that isn't enough?

What if

3

they - they're squandering their resources?

4

dumb police chief who's - who's using most of his

5

resources in fruitless roadblocks.

6
7

You have a

What do we do then?

MR. FEINERMAN: Then the courts step in and apply
the Brown reasonableness factors.

8

QUESTION: Well, what - that's what I'm asking.

9

What makes this reasonable that wouldn't make other ones

10

reasonable?

11

roadblock asking about general crime - you know, sir, have

12

you seen any crime committed in the last 6 months,

13

something like that?

14

What would be unreasonable?

A - a general

Would that be -

MR. FEINERMAN: That would be closer - that would

15

be closer to the situation that was presented in Edmond,

16

although it wouldn't - it wouldn't present one of the

17

hallmarks of what we believe is a general crime control

18

roadblock, which is that it's the goal of the police to

19

incriminate the motorists as opposed to simply seek

20

information.

21

QUESTION: No, it wouldn't - it wouldn't come

22

within that, but you think that that would - would be

23

invalid even though you would support these informational

24

roadblocks in some circumstances?

25

MR. FEINERMAN: That - that question, of course,

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

isn't presented here, but I - I -

2

QUESTION: No kidding.

3

MR. FEINERMAN: - I understand, but our - I - I

4

suppose we would say that such roadblocks should not be

5

declared per se invalid under the Fourth Amendment, but

6

rather they ought to be subject to the Brown balancing

7

test.

8
9
10
11
12

QUESTION: You going to answer my question?
Would that one be invalid or not?
MR. FEINERMAN: It would depend upon the
circumstances.

We could -

QUESTION: I gave you the circumstances.

It's a

13

general roadblock.

14

simply for the purpose of asking, sir or madam, have you

15

seen a crime committed within the last 6 months?

16

They stop everybody who comes along

MR. FEINERMAN: I think there - there would be -

17
18

QUESTION: What other circumstances do you need?

19

Whether it's raining or not?

20

MR. FEINERMAN: No.

21

QUESTION: Okay.

22

MR. FEINERMAN: I can't -

23

QUESTION: - a yes or no?

24

MR. FEINERMAN: It's, in my most instances it

25

Now, can you give me -

Is that good or bad?

would be bad, but -

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Okay.

2

MR. FEINERMAN: - I - I don't know if we could

3

foreclose the possibility that there might be some

4

circumstances were such a roadblock would be reasonable.

5

For example, let's assume that in - in some area of some

6

city that there's just rapid lawlessness because of a

7

blackout or whatever and there are hundreds of crimes

8

committed and the police might want to canvass the

9

neighborhood but nobody wants to be seen talking to a

10

police officer.

So in that instance perhaps a roadblock

11

would be set up where the police would hand each motorist

12

a piece of paper saying, you don't have to talk to me now

13

but here's a number, and if you know of anything that had

14

happened that was unlawful, please feel free to give us a

15

call, we'll maintain our confidentiality.

16

QUESTION: Well, what - what about -

17

QUESTION: Mr. -

18

QUESTION: - a road - roadblock that you find in

19

perhaps some smaller towns where the police just very

20

briefly stop you and ask you to contribute to the police

21

boys fund.

22
23

MR. FEINERMAN: I'm - I'm not sure that would be
a - a crime control roadblock.

24

QUESTION: I don't think it is.

25

(Laughter.)

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FEINERMAN: That - that perhaps would be

2

valid and now it would be a better practice, of course, if

3

the police were to simply approach cars that were stopped

4

at a stoplight or a stop sign or a tollbooth.
QUESTION: If you had that kind of a roadblock

5
6

and one of the drivers just about ran into the policeman,

7

do you think that the court - the courts would entertain

8

the argument that, well, the initial stop was invalid,

9

therefore running into the policeman - it cannot be

10

grounds for the arrest?

I - it's just a clumsy way of

11

asking, I guess, whether - whether or not there is any

12

kind of a causation break here, causation link problem.

13

MR. FEINERMAN: Yeah, we - that - that argument

14

perhaps could been made below but it wasn't, and as this

15

case comes to this Court, the assumption is that if - if

16

the roadblock were invalid under the Fourth Amendment,

17

then the subsequent arrest would be as well.

18

the - the - Mr. Lidster almost running into the police

19

officer did provide cause, that question's not presented

20

here.

Even though

21

QUESTION: Mr. Feinerman, may I go back to your

22

own hypothetical of a moment ago in which this crime has

23

been committed, people don't want to be seen talking to

24

the police, so the police might set up a roadblock under

25

those circumstances.

What about the same situation in

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which the police say - and I suppose it would be

2

reasonable in your hypo that they need to talk to a lot

3

more people than simply the ones who were driving in cars

4

- on your reasoning, could the police, in effect, cordon

5

off sidewalks so that any pedestrian coming down the

6

sidewalk would have to pass through sort of a chute at the

7

end and could not get through with stopping to talk to the

8

police officer and answer questions in order to get

9

through?

10

MR. FEINERMAN: No, Justice Souter, because

11

pedestrians have greater Fourth Amendment rights than

12

motorists.

13

QUESTION: Well, they - they - they do in the

14

sense that we - we recognize certain rights to stop the

15

motorist because of the regulated nature and the highly

16

dangerous nature of the - of the driving enterprise.

17

here we're talking about stops which bear absolutely no

18

relation to the regulation of motor vehicles.

19

reason for the stop in the case that you're defending, and

20

the only reason for the stop in my hypo is that there may

21

be an opportunity to gather evidence from a citizen who

22

won't come forward but would answer a question.

23

seems to me that the difference between cars and

24

pedestrians has nothing to do with the - the - the answer

25

to my question.

But

The only

So it

Am I wrong there?

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FEINERMAN: I believe so, Your Honor, with

2

respect.

It would be permissible with motorists.

It

3

wouldn't be permissible with pedestrians because motorists

4

do not have the same expectation of freedom of movement

5

that pedestrians do.
QUESTION: No, but the - no, but the

6
7

justification for interfering with their freedom of

8

movement is not the justification that's involved in this

9

stop.

You're not looking for impaired motorists.

You're

10

not checking licenses and registrations.

11

stopping motorists because they might have seen a crime,

12

and in the extension of your hypo I'm talking about the

13

pedestrian who might have seen a crime or have some

14

evidence of it.

15

If you can stop the cars, why can't you stop the

16

pedestrians?

17

You're simply

They're in exactly the same situation.

MR. FEINERMAN: Again, I - I just have to rely on

18

my prior answer.

It's because this Court has held that in

19

certain - in certain situations, suspicionless roadway

20

stops are permissible, or at least subject - potentially

21

permissible and subject to the Brown balancing test.

22

QUESTION: Does one have a - in - is it - a

23

greater sense of privacy walking down a main thoroughfare

24

than being in a car?

25

a home or an office, but you're out there on the street

I understand the distinction between

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the police could make - could - the police could go to

2

any particular pedestrian and say, could you tell me if

3

you know anything about X crime that was committed in this

4

neighborhood and the police could do that?
MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.

5

The police can

6

walk up to any pedestrian and ask questions and that's not

7

a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION: Can they make the pedestrian stop?

8

I

9

mean, I'm walking along, the police says, excuse me, sir,

10

can I ask - I say, no, I'm too busy, and I keep walking.

11

MR. FEINERMAN: No.

12

QUESTION: Can they arrest me for keeping on

13

walking?

14

MR. FEINERMAN: No.

15

police cannot do that, but -

16

That's Brown v. Texas.

The

QUESTION: So why can they do it with a car?

Is

17

that what happened here?

18

gear as it cruised, you know, rolled up to the roadblock

19

and the same thing happened, the policeman said, I want to

20

ask you, you know, sir, I'd like to ask you a question.

21

I'm sorry, I'm too busy, just keeps rolling on through.

22

Would - would he have been arrested in this roadblock?

23

Suppose this car were in first

MR. FEINERMAN: If - if he's - if he rolled on

24

through and - or - or if he stopped and said, I don't like

25

- I don't want to -

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: He didn't stop at all.

He kept

2

rolling at a very slow speed and he just told the

3

policeman, I'm sorry, I'm too busy.
MR. FEINERMAN: The - the record doesn't reflect

4
5

whether any such instances happened and that would be a

6

close QUESTION: He'd be arrested, let's - he'd be

7
8

arrested pretty MR. FEINERMAN: Perhaps he would be arrested for

9
10

not following -

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. FEINERMAN: Perhaps he would be arrested for

13

not following the police officer's -

14

QUESTION: Well, now -

15

MR. FEINERMAN: - instruction, but really the -

16

QUESTION: Do - do you think he could do the same

17

thing with a - with a pedestrian?
MR. FEINERMAN: No, no.

18
19

Texas.

20

that this -

21

And that's Brown v.

Pedestrians cannot be seized for this purpose and

QUESTION: Well, now, in the Edmonds case, the

22

Court opinion said that under exigent circumstances there

23

could be some kind of a - an appropriately tailored

24

roadblock.

25

witness was some kind of an exigent circumstance here?

Do you take the position that trying to find a

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FEINERMAN: No.

Our position is not that

2

there are exigent circumstances.

Our position is that

3

this is not a general crime control roadblock.

A crime -

4
QUESTION: When you make your balance under

5
6

Brown, do you - does the time that it takes to answer the

7

officer's inquiry the relevant factor or the time you have

8

to wait in line if there's a big - it's a crowded street,

9

you know, they - you cause a traffic jam, you have to wait

10

20 minutes?
MR. FEINERMAN: It's our position that it's only

11
12

the time that - of the police-motorist encounter.
QUESTION: So that even if in fact the delay

13
14

caused the - a bunch of people a half hour's delay, that

15

would be irrelevant?
MR. FEINERMAN: In - in our - we - we - if - were

16
17

that question presented, we would say that that's

18

irrelevant because that's simply endemic.

19

byproduct of driving.

That's just a

QUESTION: It's a byproduct of the seizure of one

20
21

person that you got to wait - wait in turn to be seized

22

yourself.

23

MR. FEINERMAN: That's true, and - but what's -

24

the reason why - the police don't want there to be a line.

25

The police just want to talk to each motorist as they're

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

driving by.
QUESTION: No, but if - if you're on a busy

3

street, as they were in - in - I forget which suburb of

4

Chicago this was -

5

QUESTION: Lombard.

6

QUESTION: - in Lombard, you're gonna - you're

7
8

gonna tie up traffic for a while.
MR. FEINERMAN: Yeah, I should mention - I should

9

mention that Mr. Lidster at his trial, at page 47 of the

10

transcript, testified that there were only three cars in

11

front of him.

12

a minute, which is permissible.

13

in your hypothetical where a motorist were stopped for a

14

half an hour, we would still say that that waiting time

15

doesn't count because that's really more a function of the

16

number of vehicles on the street and it's not really - it

17

was not intended by the officer that there be this backup.

So he was stopped really for - at most only
But were there a case as

18

QUESTION: I - I suppose part of the

19

reasonableness inquiry has to be what alternatives were

20

available to achieve the same objective.

21

the police just have had a big sign on the side of the

22

road, one of those, you know, illuminated signs that they

23

have now, which said, you know, please help us, looking

24

for hit-and-run -

25

And why couldn't

MR. FEINERMAN: It -

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: - last week, something like that.

And

2

then those people who are willing to cooperate could pull

3

over and cooperate and those - those who want to have

4

nothing to do with it can keep on moving.

5

MR. FEINERMAN: That would be possible, but this

6

Court has said very clearly that a less restrictive means

7

test is not to be applied under the second Brown factor.
QUESTION: I'm not applying the least - least

8
9

restrictive means test, but surely one of the - one of the

10

factors in determining whether this was reasonable is

11

whether you could have done - achieved the same objective

12

in - in some other manner.
MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.

13

That is a factor

14

and - but these kinds of signs or billboards, it isn't

15

like it just says, drink Budweiser or fly United Airlines,

16

there's a lot of information on there, and if these cars

17

are QUESTION: It might distract drivers if - if a

18
19

big sign on the road - on the highway when you're supposed

20

to be looking at the road.

21

there's a - there's an aspect of this, you've repeated the

22

police many times, and one of the worrisome things of this

23

set-up is all you need is a crime, and in major

24

metropolitan areas there are crimes, multiple crimes every

25

day.

That might be a reason, but

Who makes the decision?

The local police chief.

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And then after some, you can get into court.

2

not like the law dictates this or even the State's

3

Attorney General, but it's in every town, the local police

4

chief that may have just a range of views about using

5

roadblocks.

6

It's - it's

MR. FEINERMAN: That - that's what the Brown

7

balancing test is there for.

8

kinds of stops are reasonable and which one aren't.

9

if there are some circumstances where we can imagine that

10

we'd want to have this kind of informational checkpoint,

11

then a - and that's really the principal question here.

12

There ought not to be a per se rule, because there are

13

some situations, and we submit that this is one of them,

14

where it makes perfect sense for the police to set up a

15

roadblock because the physical evidence recovered from the

16

scene was not sufficient to identify the perpetrator, and

17

the only witnesses to the crime were fellow motorists, and

18

there was really only one way our - there wasn't only one

19

way, but this was a very good way of getting at them.

20

if there are circumstances where we can imagine that we'd

21

want to enable the police to solve crimes in this manner,

22

then a per se rule is invalid.

23

Brown balancing.

24
25

It's there to determine what
Now,

And

It ought to go through

QUESTION: You - you mentioned that this is a
good way to get at the people you want to get to.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

7

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The reason a news story covering a - a hit-and-

11

run fatality, as in this case, is not as effective for a

12

number of reasons.

13

majority of Americans don't watch local news.

14

importantly, there is significant value as - as has long

15

been recognized when police deal with pedestrians and

16

approach them, seeking their assistance in solving crimes,

17

there is significant value to having a police officer

18

approach someone in a one-on-one manner in an effort to

19

solve a crime.

20

First of all, statistically, the
More

First of all, the - the approach impresses on

21

people, who are otherwise very busy, the importance of the

22

matter before them and that this may be worth devoting

23

their time.

24

advise the person, in addition, that what you say might be

25

significant even though you didn't see an accident.

The police officer's one-on-one approach can

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: But can you stop the person?

I mean,

2

put it in a pedestrian context, do you think a police

3

officer can insist that the person stop, stand there, and

4

listen to his pitch?

5

MS. MILLETT: No, absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

6

There is a long - just there is a long historic

7

distinction between cars and homes, there's a long

8

historic distinction between cars and pedestrians, and the

9

reason - as a practical matter, you have to have a very,

10

very brief seizure here to protect the life and limb of

11

the police officer while he tries to make this approach.

12

That's not needed when you're approaching pedestrians.

13
14
15

QUESTION: Why - why does the distinction you've mentioned it and - and Mr. Feinerman mentioned it why does the distinction between cars and pedestrians

16

apply in a case in which the - the justification for

17

making that distinction, regulation, a risk of impaired

18

driving, does not apply?

19

MS. MILLETT: What - what is relevant is what

20

this Court has long recognized is - is the difference in

21

your reasonable expectations of freedom of movement

22

between people in cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk.

23

QUESTION: No, but my expectation of freedom of

24

movement in the car is that, yeah, the police can stop to

25

- for a sobriety checkpoint and I'll assume they can -

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they can stop to - to check my - my license and the

2

registration of the car, but I also assume that they

3

can't, you know, barring today, the result of today's

4

case, I - I'm assuming that they - they can't stop me for

5

- for other reasons, barring some really exigent

6

circumstance.

7

I think it has been at least up until today, then I think

8

my expectation is - is the same as the pedestrian's

9

expectation, barring the - the regulatory authority of -

10

of exercising the regulatory authority, which is not in -

11
12

And if that expectation is reasonable, and

in issue here.
MS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, the essential

13

command of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and

14

there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment that says stops

15

for sobriety or stops to see if you have any aliens in

16

your trunk are inherently reasonable and nothing else is.

17

It's a balancing test, as this Court has long recognized,

18

and an important part of that balance is the expectations

19

that the individual brings to it, and the expectation of

20

the individual behind the wheel is that there are a number

21

of times that I will come into contact with police

22

officers and I will need to stop, I'm highly regulated,

23

I'm highly restricted, and I am engaged in a privilege of

24

driving on the public roadways.

25

privilege.

Walking is not a

Driving on the public roadways is and so the

1

question QUESTION: You're - you're saying that because

2
3

they might have observed or - or observed evidence in the

4

exercise of their privilege that that would be a

5

regulatory basis for stopping them in the cars, whereas

6

there wouldn't be any such basis for the pedestrian?
MS. MILLETT: The regulatory need for it is that

7
8

there's - you have a very common police practice here, and

9

one that we expect the police to do if a - a fatality has

10

been committed is try to find witnesses who were there at

11

the time.

12

The only way that principle can work QUESTION: And - and we understand that when -

13

when there's something pretty contemporaneous between the

stopping and the - and the accident.

mind with exigency.

16

practice that a week later or two weeks later -

17

That's what I had in

But do we - is - is it such a common

MS. MILLETT: It is extremely common for these

18

types of informational checkpoints.

There's two different

19

types of checkpoints.

20

catch the person right after the crime's been committed.

There is the one that's trying to

21

QUESTION: Yeah.

22

MS. MILLETT: But the witness checkpoints are

23

quite routinely done, either 24 hours, or very routinely,

24

a week after, because people are creatures of habit and

25

they tend to drive the same roads at the same time of -

QUESTION: Have they been successful?

Is your

12

knowledge of these things profound enough that you can say

13

how successful they've been?

14

MS. MILLETT: I - I can't give you -

15

QUESTION: Do you know of any that have been

MS. MILLETT: Yes, absolutely.

20

four eyewitnesses to a hit-and-run fatality.

the ability to measure success here - we're not talking

22

about immediately removing a drunk driver from the road or

23

actually finding the alien - solving - you're successful

24

if you defined you solved the crime, and solving a crime

25

is not a linear project.

But also,

It involves a lot of information

1
2

coming in from a different QUESTION: But you couldn't - you couldn't do

3

this to try to get the perpetrator.

4

Edmond, and there seems to be something odd about saying,

5

police, you can't have a roadblock in a neighborhood where

6

you think that it's likely the suspect is living, but you

7

can if you say what you're looking for, it's not the

8

suspect, but witnesses.

9

That would clearly be

MS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, I - two

10

responses.

First of all there are - Edmond leaves open

11

that there are at least some circumstances when you can do

12

this - maybe to approach is exigency - but where you can

13

do these types of checkpoints to catch someone.

14

language there was a fleeing dangerous criminal who was

15

going by particular routes, so it's not - that doesn't

16

seem to be foreclosed in all circumstances.

17

reason it makes a big differences for purposes of Fourth

18

Amendment principles, there's actually three reasons why

19

looking for witnesses is better and should be more

20

consistent with the Fourth Amendment than what - the issue

21

in Edmond.

22

between, just a practical difference, between police

23

taking action, seizing people first and looking for a

24

crime to go with them, which is what was going on in

25

Edmond, or having a specific crime and looking to solve it

The

And that is, there - there's a difference

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in the most sensible and reasonable manner that police

2

officers do, and that is looking for witnesses.
QUESTION: Well, following Justice Ginsburg's

3
4

question, which is the easier of the two cases?

The one

5

we have here or a hypothetical case in which they have a

6

description of the hit-and-run driver and they stop

7

everybody to look in the car to see if the driver meets

8

the description?

9

sustain?

Which is the easier of the two cases to

10

MS. MILLETT: Assuming that this is not - it's

11

not right after the crime that I have the description QUESTION: A week later, everything else the

12
13
14

same.
MS. MILLETT: I think this Court's - I think both

15

of them are different from Edmond, but I do think this

16

Court's doctrines establish why the witness approach is -

17

is more - is less intrusive on Fourth Amendment interests

18

for - for three reasons.

19

incrimination component, self-protection component to the

20

Fourth Amendment and that has been very important in the

- which is easier to say is consistent with the Fourth

Amendment?

MS. MILLETT: There -

12

easier because I don't - which is - the two cases that he

13

gave, in which do you think it's easier for you to win

14

your argument?

15

MS. MILLETT: I - I think the witness one is

16

easier for three reasons, and one is because the Fourth

17

Amendment has this self-protection principle, which is not

18

implicated when you're - you're looking for witnesses.

19

The checkpoint does not -

20

QUESTION: In other words, this case is easier?

1

MS. MILLETT: Yes.

This case is easier, but -

2

but there's - there's two other reasons besides the self-

3

protection principle.

4

of the balancing tests - factors - in Brown v. Texas is

the level of anxiety.

thing?

case, though, doesn't it?

This was at midnight.

MS. MILLETT: No, no.

Part of the Brown v. Texas

22

balancing factors is - is of - one of the things that's

23

been mentioned is the level of anxiety, and the reason

24

that you don't have roving stops but you're allowed to

25

have checkpoints is when you see other people being

drunk -

3
4

QUESTION: I have a pending question about the the third reason.

I - what's the third reason?

MS. MILLETT: The third - thank you - the third

5
6

reason is - is a - is a - there's a sort of a practical

7

limitation on the use of these checkpoints when police are

8

not allowed to use it to do their run-of-the-mill

9

business.

Their job is to find crimes and criminals.

10

Edmond was a checkpoint to find crimes and criminals that

11

we didn't know about, when instead all that's being done

12

here is this is an adjunct to a - adapting to the roadway

13

context the normal investigative processes of police

14

officers.

15

way -

16
17

You - you don't have that abuse, and the same

QUESTION: So this is a built-in limitation on
the frequency of its use?

18

MS. MILLETT: It is, and Justice Kennedy, you

19

also asked about doctrinal limitations in this Court's

20

cases, and in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista the exact same

21

argument was made dealing with misdemeanor arrests.

22

this Court's decision there specifically relied upon the

23

good sense and political accountability of police, for the

24

same reason that we know police don't arrest for every

25

crime and infraction that - vehicle code infraction that

A lot of police chiefs are arrested and

checkpoints are a great equalizer, especially these kind,

occurred QUESTION: Arrested or elected?

say arrested or elected?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. RAMSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16

18

MR. RAMSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The mass, suspicionless seizure of innocent

19

citizens for the purpose of investigating ordinary

20

criminal wrongdoing without exigent circumstances is a

21

violation of the Fourth Amendment, and Indianapolis v.

22

Edmond is the controlling precedent.

23

QUESTION: Well, that sounds a little colorful,

but - but in my own mind I'm thinking that this is asking

25

people to help with crime investigation and to spend 10

Now, it's - I was

delayed 2 hours - not 2 hours, but like 2 minutes anyway,

3

or 3 minutes, this morning coming in, for the last couple

4

of days because they had some tree pruning equipment, all

5

right?

6

not delay me, but I don't mind.

7

I mean -

So maybe they could put that on the sidewalk and
I did actually mind, but

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION: - but - you see, it's not - what their

10

argument is, and that's, at least for me, what I'd like

11

you to address, is this is not much of a - of a demand on

12

people to stop for 10 seconds when they're trying to find

13

out somebody who killed someone and - and we just want you

14

to listen for 10 seconds.

unreasonable thing for the police to ask the public to do?

I tried to make it as - as reasonable-sounding as I could.

response to my effort to make this sound very reasonable.

MR. RAMSELL: It remains unreasonable for a

2
3

number of matters.

It's the aggregate of the

4

circumstances then by which other innocent persons could

5

be seized.

6

concern in this particular event is far less than the

3

I thought they were given a flyer saying if you - read

4

this and see if you observed anything that could help us

MR. RAMSELL: Detective Vasil testified that they

were stopped, given a flyer, but also asked if they had

8

been in the area last week and if they had seen anything

9

unusual.

That second phase was relatively

10

interrogational, although field interrogational.

11

Nevertheless, it is somewhat intrusive on what are

12

considered some of our privacy QUESTION: Well, suppose that there is a

MR. RAMSELL: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it would

purpose of that seizure not being in the investigation or

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

QUESTION: So they can hold him up for 2 hours if

4

they're collecting for the police boys fund but they can't

5

hold him up for 10 or 15 seconds if they're trying to

QUESTION: You - you say that passes the Fourth

13

investigation does not.

That can't be right.

MR. RAMSELL: I - I would submit, Justice Scalia,

that if you were to stop a person and seize them for no

reason whatsoever that that would not survive a Fourth

change in the way these organizations raise money.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. RAMSELL: It - it is often difficult to say

9

no when - when a fireman is seeking some funds.

However,

10

it is certainly not the detection or investigation of

11

crime, and the analysis that would take place there would

12

be different, and certainly 2 hours to put money in a can

13

would suggest that the scope and duration of that stop was

14

far beyond what was reasonable.
QUESTION: Maybe - maybe your response to Justice

15
16

Breyer's question - I'm not sure that reasonableness for

17

Fourth Amendment purposes is the same as reasonableness in

18

general.

19

not talking about the Fourth Amendment - an unreasonable

20

thing for a policeman to knock on your door and say,

21

excuse me, sir, we're investigating a crime, we really

22

need your help, do you mind if I - I come in and ask you a

23

couple of questions just to help us solve this crime?

24

you think that's reasonable in - in - in a sense?

25

it is.

Do you think it would be - in general, if you're

MR. RAMSELL: It is considered a voluntary

2

encounter to the extent that if you choose to open the

3

door and engage in that conversation the Fourth Amendment

4

isn't even implicated there.

5
6
7
8
9

QUESTION: No, the person says, unreasonably says
no, and the policeman comes in anyway.
MR. RAMSELL: That would be a violation of the
Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION: Even though it isn't really the

10

policeman that's being unreasonable in the general sense.

11

It seems to me it's quite unreasonable for the homeowner

12

to refuse to cooperate at all with the police in the - in

13

the solving of a - let's assume it's a major crime.

14

seems to me unreasonable, but even so, the policeman is

15

not allowed to come into the home.

16

That

MR. RAMSELL: That's correct, Your Honor, and

17

there's the difference between the voluntary consensual

18

encounter and what we have in this case was clearly

19

involuntary.

20

They even had an officer -

QUESTION: And so also here.

It might be very

21

unreasonable for the person not to want to cooperate, and

22

it might be quite reasonable for the policeman to seek the

23

cooperation, but that doesn't necessarily answer the

24

Fourth Amendment question.

25

MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that the fact that

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

an innocent motorist would feel that he or she was

2

unreasonable by not cooperating suggests the compulsive

3

aspects of this scenario, make it more of a violation of

4

the Fourth Amendment, and more unreasonable to that

5

extent.

One QUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, did I understand your

6
7

argument to be that if the crime had been a child

8

abduction, that this kind of roadblock to try to get

9

evidence would be permissible?
MR. RAMSELL: In - in a general sense, yes.

10

Of

11

course, there would be other factors involved, but child

12

abductions generally fall within the exigent circumstance

13

analysis.

14

evaluation of the facts behind why they felt that -

15

Clearly there would likely have to be further

QUESTION: Well, why if - if it's the danger

16

involved and wanting to save a life that we hope is still

17

in being, why isn't the same thing if you're trying to get

18

evidence about a hit-and-run person who kills people on

19

the highway?

20

MR. RAMSELL: Well, first off, the child

21

abduction is a continuing crime, to the extent that the

22

need for action in order to prevent the passable future or

23

immediate harm to that child, makes that an exigent

24

circumstance by itself.

25

QUESTION: So you think this would be different

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

if this was a serial hit-and-run killer, right?

2

one a week.

3

situation and maybe they could conduct the - the

4

roadblock.

5

He does

Then - then you think it'd be a different

MR. RAMSELL: Well, as we had in Sitz with the

6

imminent hazard of drunk drivers, if there were such a

7

thing as a serial hit-and-run driver, the imminency, the

8

exigency would be suggested within that hypothetical, and

9

so I believe that it would be more reasonable under that

10
11

circumstance, but what we QUESTION: And what about a rape murder that -

12

you know that that's not just a hypothetical case?

13

MR. RAMSELL: That had recently occurred?

14

QUESTION: A rape murder recently occurred and

15
16

the police set up a roadblock to get evidence.
MR. RAMSELL: Again, if there was - if it was

17

very fresh, and the more fresh it is the more reasonable

18

it tends to become under a simply an exigency analysis,

19

the fresher the crime the more believability -

20

QUESTION: So would this - would this case have

21

been different if it had been the next day rather than a

22

week later?

23

MR. RAMSELL: If they had some independent

24

evidence to suggest that the person was still in the area,

25

that may have been a different set of facts.

Commonwealth

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

v. Burns was an example of a informational roadblock where

2

they had independent evidence to believe that the murderer

3

was still in the area.

4

I believe that was 2 days later.

QUESTION: So if you need a little - if you have

5

a little evidence, then you can seek more.

6

none, you can't try to get a lead by this technique?

7

But if you had

MR. RAMSELL: Justice Ginsburg, I believe the

8

exigency of the circumstances would certainly authorize

9

more - a possible information roadblock under those

10
11

circumstances.
QUESTION: Did this - is it the case that in this

12

very situation we're talking about it led to information

13

about the person responsible?

14

MR. RAMSELL: Justice O'Connor, my understanding

15

is that the roadblock itself was entirely ineffective.

It

16

had zero effectiveness in seeking to obtain information

17

regarding this event.

18

heard that it was the television which led to some

19

information, which is a standard police practice, does not

20

implicate the Fourth Amendment, does not require any

21

seizure of innocent persons -

In fact, I believe that we've just

22

QUESTION: Yeah, but it requires a roadblock.

23

MR. RAMSELL: I believe that in the television

24

context there's no roadblock at issue and no one's even

25

compelled to watch the television -

1

QUESTION: Well, but maybe television won't cover

2

just a blurb put out by the police where they will cover a

3

roadblock.
MR. RAMSELL: That may or may not be true, Your

4
5

Honor, but there are -

6

QUESTION: Nothing duller than watching a wall of

7

- of wanted posters, you know, and now, for our listeners,

8

we're going to pan the wanted posters at the post office.

9

I mean -

10

MR. RAMSELL: That would -

11

QUESTION: - that is not going to sell.

12
13

Who's

going to sponsor that?
MR. RAMSELL: That would certainly be very boring

14

to - to watch wanted posters, certainly if they were

15

repetitious -

16
17

QUESTION: But if - if they hired someone like
Justice Scalia to go on the screen and describe it -

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION: - big audience.

20

QUESTION: Can I ask you a question about the

21

facts of this case, please?

The blue brief describes it

22

as a - a roadblock - roadblock set up in the evening, and

23

as I understand it the crime was at 12:15 a.m., which I

24

interpret to be midnight.

25

thought the roadblock was at midnight, and I wonder, how

It was a midnight crime and I

1

long did it last?

2

lasted several hours or was it just -

3

Was it started in the evening and

MR. RAMSELL: To be frank, searching the record

4

it's - it's relatively unclear.

5

minutes to 2 hours at most.

7

My understanding is 90

QUESTION: And it - it was though in the dark at
- at night, not during the day?

8

MR. RAMSELL: Yes, it was at night.

9

QUESTION: And I also don't understand if they

10

handed something to read, how could you read in the - at

11

the - in the dark?

12
13
14

MR. RAMSELL: That would also be equally as
difficult, Your Honor.

I -

QUESTION: Does the record explain that they did

15

hand something legible to the person or use a flashlight

16

or what - what was the -

17

MR. RAMSELL: Logic would seem to dictate that by

18

the time the person received the flyer and drove away they

19

would again be away from the scene of the event before

20

they even read the flyer, which also makes it somewhat

21

ineffective in that regard.

22

QUESTION: But did they - were there something

23

they were asked to read before they left or just left with

24

them to drive away with?

25

happened, to tell you the truth.

I just don't understand what

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. RAMSELL: Well, to - to take - to take the 10

2

to 15 seconds Detective Vasil describes as the duration of

3

handing the flyer, asking two questions, and obtaining two

4

answers, it would seem that reading the flyer would have

5

had to have occurred sometime after the seizure.

6

QUESTION: I see.

7

QUESTION: There wasn't very much on the flyer,

8

was there?
MR. RAMSELL: Well, it did have some - it - it

9
10

indicated the -

11

QUESTION: We - we have it someplace, don't we?

12

MR. RAMSELL: Yes.

It is in the joint appendix

13

and it's located on page 9 of the joint appendix, and

14

there is - there is a great amount of detail that's in

15

that flyer, certainly would suggest it would be difficult

16

for one to read the entirety of it, understand the purpose

17

for which they were even being stopped that evening, which

18

is another point.

19

sobriety checkpoints, where as you're arriving, and even

20

before you have contact with - with the police officers,

21

there's a sign that says, warning, sobriety checkpoint

22

ahead.

23

what it is that's taking place in front of you.

24

people are waiting in line having no idea what it is -

25

There was no advance signs, unlike

At least you're putting - you're put on notice
Here,

QUESTION: Well, but that - that happens in a lot

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of other contexts too.

You can be driving on a highway,

2

all of a sudden everything comes to a stop.

3

matter?

Is it an accident?

4

repair?

And you just don't know, I mean, that's part of

5

the condition of driving.

What's the

Are they having one-lane

MR. RAMSELL: Well, certainly we have to expect

6
7

that we'll be stopped more often than anyone would wish in

8

that context, but it - it's quite different when you are -

9

when there's six to twelve emergency vehicles there and

10

as you get closer and closer you see this encounter taking

11

place before you with every single motorist in front of

12

you.

13

innocent citizen, I would suggest.

That raises the anxiety of even the - the most

QUESTION: Might I ask another question about the

14

Reading the flyer, it's

15

- the facts of the case?

16

something you could have handed to a pedestrian too who

17

might have been at the scene.

18

whether they did hand this flyer to pedestrians who might

19

have been walking by at the same time the week after the

20

accident?

21

Does the record show

MR. RAMSELL: Well, my understanding of this

22

location, being familiar with the area, is that it's a

23

major thoroughfare with -

24

QUESTION: Right.

I know -

25

MR. RAMSELL: - multiple lanes.

It would be

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

highly unlikely at midnight that any pedestrian would or

2

should be walking on the shoulder of this high speed limit

3

-

4

QUESTION: Oh, there are no sidewalks there?

5

MR. RAMSELL: No.

6

There are rarely sidewalks in

our town, unfortunately.

7

QUESTION: Oh, okay.

8

QUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, there's something I'd

9

like you to comment on.

The - the Illinois Supreme Court

10

was - was concerned about the - the effect of - of this

11

practice, in effect, in opening the door to stops all the

12

time.

13

if it's justified here it will be justified in other cases

14

and so on, and there have been some questions from the

15

bench to that effect.

16

They said, you know, there are loads of crimes and

One answer to that might be that under the law

17

as it stands now the police can conduct sobriety

18

checkpoints and we will assume that they can make license

19

and registration checks and things like that.

20

the police already have an opportunity, to put it bluntly,

21

to abuse their right to stop if they want to do it.

22

there any indication that there is this kind of abuse

23

going on, and hence, is there any reason to believe that

24

the abuse would be greater if this practice passed muster

25

than it is under the existing law?

So the -

Is

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. RAMSELL: Well, I believe that law

2

enforcement is always appreciative of any techniques or

3

tools that they're allowed to use for investigatory

4

purposes.
QUESTION: But what - what do we know?

5
6

Empirically, what we do know?

What is - has there - has

7

there been an indication of abuse?

8

believe that this invitation, this tool, would be abused

9

more than the tools that they now have?

Is there a reason to

MR. RAMSELL: I would believe that it would be

10
11

more - more likely for abuse if this Court were to suggest

12

that these type of roadblocks were a valid investigative

13

tool.

14

QUESTION: But why - why?

15

MR. RAMSELL: Because it would simply, number

16

one, it is - it makes for great publicity for law

17

enforcement to use these roadblocks.

18

a -

19

QUESTION: Well, it makes for great publicity to

20

- to have sobriety checkpoints.

21

they have them.

22

They feel that it's

That's one reason why

MR. RAMSELL: And - I agree, even though

23

statistically roadblock sobriety checkpoints tend to be

24

far less effective than saturation patrols.

25

chiefs comment that they don't get the type of publicity

Most police

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they receive from a roadblock that they get from

2

saturation patrols.
QUESTION: Is it true that -QUESTION: Suppose

3
4

they had done the same thing they did here, the same

5

thing, except that, in addition to giving them a flyer and

6

asking them about what happened - were - you know, were

7

you here a week before, they - it was also a check of

8

driver registration?
MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest the programmatic

9
10

purpose, the primary programmatic purpose employed in

11

Edmond would still remain that this was for the purpose of

12

crime detection and investigation, not for simply checking

13

licenses.

QUESTION: Well, they were actually checking

14
15

The same -

licenses.

I mean, they're - they're really doing it.

16

MR. RAMSELL: And I -

17

QUESTION: And they - they pick up some people

18

who don't - don't have licenses, but while they're at it

19

they kill two birds with one stone.

20

make it bad because its primary purpose was the other?

And you say it would

21

MR. RAMSELL: Justice Scalia, I would suggest the

22

programmatic purpose, which would be a question of intent,

23

would still remain that it was truly for the investigation

24

of this particular crime and certainly the duration and

25

the scope of the seizure would exceed the license check

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

when questions were being asked about whether you had been

2

here last week, whether you had seen anything regarding a

3

hit-and-run or any other crime.

4

exceed even the suggested appropriateness of a roadblock

5

for license checks in Prouse.

And that would seem to

QUESTION: That - that incremental point of time

6
7

- you're really playing with a - an inconsequential -

8

inconsequential impingement upon the person's time.
QUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, do you know - going back

9
10

to Justice Souter's question - whether in the aftermath of

11

Sitz there have been an increase in sobriety checkpoints

12

in this country?
MR. RAMSELL: I know that a - a far greater

13
14

number have been reported since Sitz, but I cannot confess

15

to knowing what the statistics or the record-keeping was

16

prior to Sitz, but it has - it has now crept into the

17

American psyche that roadblocks are a - a regular way of

18

life.

19

QUESTION: But do - do they exist in Michigan

20

anymore, these sobriety checkpoints?

21

MR. RAMSELL: No.

When the - when the case was

22

remanded to Michigan, Michigan found under their own State

23

constitution that this - that a sobriety checkpoint still

24

remained to be an unreasonable violation of the search and

25

seizure clause of their own constitution, so they do not

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have them.
Now, in this case, what we have is we have a - a

2
3

very stale event.

4

that the driver was perhaps even negligent in how the

5

accident occurred.

6

thoroughfare at midnight in a place where it's highly

7

unusual to - to find pedestrians in a dark area, and

8

there's been no indication that the driver was at fault

9

other than failing to remain at the scene of the accident.

We have a - a bicyclist on a major

QUESTION: That's pretty serious, isn't it,

10
11

In fact, the facts do not even suggest

called hit-and-run?

12

MR. RAMSELL: It's hit-and-run as -

13

QUESTION: All right, so all that's at stake is

14

that it was a hit-and-run and the guy's dead, all right.

15

So - so now what has that to do with the reasonableness of

16

this?

17

think maybe you think you want to tie it in and I just

18

want you to do it.

I'm not - not asking you facetiously because I

MR. RAMSELL: Well, the consequences are very

19
20

serious.

However, hit-and-run would also fall within

21

dinging the car in the grocery parking lot next to you and

22

failing to remain at the scene.

These are single events -

23
24
25

QUESTION: So you mean that it might be
reasonable to do it for some serious crimes but not for

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

less serious?
MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that it cannot be

2
3

done for any crime except in exigent circumstances, which

4

we do not have here.

This is a stale event -

QUESTION: So even - even if it were, say, a

5
6

carjacking, where there was a fatality, if it's stale it

7

can't be done?
MR. RAMSELL: Yes, Your Honor.

8
9

I would - I would

respectfully say that, under the analysis in Edmonds,

10

there is a lack of exigency.

Edmonds suggests that, but

11

for the emergency circumstances of an - an imminent

12

terrorist attack, otherwise that would be considered a

13

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

14

accident.

15

any of the previous issues that have been brought before

16

the Court -

This is a single

It - it does not fall within the magnitude of

17

QUESTION: Now you seem - seem to be arguing the

18

same thing that, other things being equal, if you lose on

19

your other points you could only do it in a serious but

20

not non-serious.

21

you're making?

22

is.

23

Is that what you're - is that the point

And if so, I want to know what the line

MR. RAMSELL: Well, the line is exigency, and

24

exigency meaning there was no - there's an immediate

25

hazard on the roadway, which was what seemed to justify

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sobriety checkpoints in Sitz, that there would have been

2

an effectiveness to removing then-hazardous drivers and

3

preventing the potential for future injury to life and

limb.

5

facts, nevertheless, don't have the gravity of the public

concern.

This is a post-event, non-exigent roadblock.

a license number and for - for a serious crime that was
committed, say, an hour ago?

Can - can you then conduct a

MR. RAMSELL: I would submit yes, that you could

under that circumstance.

13

roadblock substantially less.

14

because it is a fresh pursuit analysis.

15

wouldn't need to pull over every car and question them if

you had a license plate number to work from.

17

Number one, you could tailor the
You have the exigency
You certainly

And so it -

it would certainly even be capable of being more

18

sufficiently tailored so that those who are admittedly

19

innocent are less likely to have their liberties

20

interfered with.

21

QUESTION: Of course -

22

QUESTION: Well, what if you - what if you just

had the information that it's - it's a black Ford SUV?

1

MR. RAMSELL: I believe under that set of

2

circumstances the exigency would suggest there would be a

3

potential for a reasonable checkpoint tailored in scope

4

and duration with sufficient guidelines in place.

5

fact, in this particular checkpoint, we have virtually no

guidelines in place.

There's no indication as to why other persons were sent to

We do not have any guidelines so

10

that if a motorist had said, yes, I was here last week,

11

and yes, I think I have some information, we have no

guidelines for those field officers as to what to do and

13

how to treat that motorist and how to detain that person.

QUESTION: You know anybody's that's challenged

these things who - for any reason other than the

16

exclusionary rule?

17

the fact that your client during the stop was found to be

driving under the influence.

19

you think there's zero chance that anyone would have cared

QUESTION: Well, if people in Lombard care about
it, they can tell the police to stop doing it.
MR. RAMSELL: I certainly would hope that they

would also exercise their right to let them know that they

dislike these roadblocks as much as perhaps others in more

9

intellectual pursuits, but -

10

QUESTION: Are there indications nationwide that

11

the public makes objection to roadblocks, other than the

12

person that's caught for drunk driving?

13

MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that most - most

14

persons are not pleased by roadblocks.

I believe that

15

most people feel that they do reflect on an invasion of

16

their privacy and liberty.

17

QUESTION: I mean, is there evidence of that?

interest, and by the fact that nothing was advanced in

this particular event suggests that even in a balancing

that one thing the Court needs to do is to, of course, let

law enforcement know in advance what will be acceptable

conduct on their part and that it would be inappropriate

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY FEINERMAN

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. FEINERMAN: This Court in Edmond found that

22

narcotics check - narcotics checkpoints are so obnoxious

23

to core Fourth Amendment values that a per se rule of

24

invalidity was justified and the principal question here

25

is whether informational checkpoints present the same

1

Fourth Amendment dangers that general crime control

2

checkpoints present, and the answer to that is no.
And in order to answer that, we - we have to

3
4

figure out what the hallmarks are of a crime control

5

checkpoint, and we suggest that there are at least two.

6

The first is that it's the purpose of the checkpoint to

7

incriminate the motorist as opposed to the situation in

8

Lombard, which was simply the police asking for help, and

9

that distinction makes a difference under the Fourth

10

Amendment for several reasons.

The first has to do with

11

privacy.

12

police are trying to learn something about you, whether

13

you've committed a wrongdoing, whereas at an informational

14

checkpoint there's just asking for help, somebody died

15

here last week, could you help us find the perpetrator.

At a general crime control checkpoint, the

There's also a difference in terms of jeopardy.

16
17

At a general crime control checkpoint you may be

18

interrogated, detained, arrested, prosecuted, and possibly

19

jailed, whereas at an informational checkpoint, again,

20

you're just being asked for help, and that's a critical

21

distinction that this Court drew in Ferguson between the

22

drug test that was invalidated in Ferguson and the drug

23

testing programs that were upheld in Skinner, Acton, and

24

Von Raab.

25

There's also an indignity element to a general

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

crime control checkpoint.

2

bit of an indignity to be suspected as being a potential

3

law-breaker, whereas in - in an informational checkpoint

4

there's really no impingement on dignity, you're just,

5

again, being treated as an ally of the police and being

6

asked for help, and in fact, it's an act of responsible

7

citizenship to provide help in that kind of situation.

8
9

You're being - it's - it's a

The second distinction is that a general crime
control checkpoint - the police are simply trolling for

10

hitherto undiscovered crimes, whereas in an informational

11

checkpoint, they're investigating a known, specific crime,

12

and that's who makes a difference.

13

between - as Ms. Millett pointed out - there's a

14

difference between knowing a crime and finding the

15

criminal and then simply rounding up a bunch of potential

16

criminals and trying to peg a crime on them.

17

important not only for the fact that we're uncomfortable

18

with general - general surveillance, but also it's a

19

traditional police function.

20

ought to return to the scene of the crime and find

21

witnesses.

There's a difference
