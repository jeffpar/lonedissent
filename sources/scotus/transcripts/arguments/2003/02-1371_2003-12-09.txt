ORAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN K. MITCHELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MS. MITCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Miranda's core ruling is that an unwarned

11

statement may not be used in the prosecution's case in

12

chief to prove guilt.

13

not seek to admit an unwarned statement, rather the

14

statement that was offered was preceded by a meticulous

15

recitation of Miranda warnings, an express waiver of

16

rights, and was the product of non-coercive questioning.

17

In this case, the prosecution did

A fully warned and otherwise voluntary statement

18

is not tainted by the existence of a prior unwarned

19

statement even if the officer intentionally initiated

20

questioning without warning and that is true for two

21

reasons.

22

First, because an officer's intent does not

23

render the unwarned statement actually involuntary.

24

unwarned statement is merely presumptively compelled, and

25

once warnings are administered, that presumption ends and

The

1

the suspect has the information necessary to make a

2

knowing and intelligent decision about waiver.

3

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt?

You say the

4

second warning removes the presumption as to the earlier

5

unwarned statement.

Why?

MS. MITCHELL:

QUESTION:

Going forward, Your Honor, yes.

Going forward, but not going

backward.
MS. MITCHELL:

No.

No, Your Honor.

Only going

-- it -- it ends the presumption at that -QUESTION:

So that you still have the

presumption that the earlier statement was involuntary.
MS. MITCHELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

It ends the

14

presumption that that -- at that point going forward

15

because it provides the --

16

QUESTION:

And is that true if the -- if the

17

conversation after the warnings includes interrogation

18

about what he said before?

19

MS. MITCHELL:

It would depend on how that

20

happened, but under the facts of this case, yes, it would

21

still remain true.

22

There are essentially -- under Miranda, there

23

are two elements that we have to look at in determining

24

whether a statement is admissible, and that is whether you

25

have a knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver and whether
4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statement is in fact voluntary.

If there is a

2

reference back, as there was in this case to the previous

3

statement, it could be a problem if that is part of the

4

waiver element.

5

indicated in Elstad itself.

6

way that affected the knowing nature then of what the --

7

the information that was imparted and made the waiver

8

therefore defective, it may be problematic.

9

in this case, where there's simply a reference back during

And I believe that's what this Court
If the officer used that in a

However, as

10

the -- the questioning, after there is a waiver and a

11

decision to go forward, that alone does not affect the

12

voluntariness of that subsequent statement.

13

QUESTION:

Would it -- would it affect it if the

14

officer said, now, an hour ago you told me X?

15

correct in saying that or not?

16

MS. MITCHELL:

Were you

Would that be permissible?

I think so.

After the decision

17

has been made to waive and the individual has decided to

18

proceed forward and talk, I believe that's correct, Your

19

Honor, because --

20

QUESTION:

No, please finish.

21

MS. MITCHELL:

-- because it does not -- it is

22

not sufficient to overbore the individual's will, which is

23

the question at that point because we're at the voluntary

24

analysis at that point.

25

QUESTION:

The difficulty I have with the
5

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

argument is the premise that you state -- is in accepting

2

the premise that you state, and that is that a second

3

interrogation that falls on the heels of the first --

4

here, I think there was a 20-minute break -- can really be

5

separated as a matter of simple psychology.

6

difficulty in accepting the plausibility of a conclusion

7

that the -- that the ostensible waiver in the second case

8

is really a free waiver as distinct from sort of throwing

9

up one's hands and saying it's too late to say no now.

I -- I have

10

It's the -- it -- there's a basic implausibility in your

11

case.

12
13

What -- what can you offer on that point?
MS. MITCHELL:

Well, first, Elstad addressed

that exact issue and came to the opposite conclusion.

14

QUESTION:

But -- but Elstad -- I mean, let me

15

-- and maybe that's the way I should have focused the

16

case.

17

-- a systematic questioning of the -- of the sort that

18

went on here.

19

in a kind of first-round interrogation, and the -- the

20

intensity of their pressure to get answers in this case

21

seems to me qualitatively different from Elstad.

22

In -- in Elstad, you did not have a -- let's say, a

Here the -- the police did, indeed, engage

MS. MITCHELL:

It is different, Your Honor.

23

There clearly is a continuum.

But the appropriate

24

question is whether the first statement was involuntary or

25

not.

If in fact that questioning and that pressure had
6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been great enough to make that first statement

2

involuntary, then absolutely it would create the kind of

3

taint that could carry forward even after subsequent

4

warnings were given.

5

Elstad.

6

I think that is the lesson of

But Elstad draws that distinction between actual

7

coercion and presumptive coercion, and where it is merely

8

presumptive -- it does not rise to the level of actual --

9

then that does not carry forward.

10

QUESTION:

But that's -- comparatively speaking,

11

I -- I think maybe that was -- that was relatively easy to

12

tell in Elstad.

13

and it seems to me that in order to litigate this issue as

14

the threshold issue to determining whether the second

15

waiver or as part of the litigation as to whether the --

16

the ostensible waiver really is a waiver and the second

17

statement really is voluntary, we're right back in the

18

morass of litigation, which is one of the principal

19

objects of Miranda to avoid in the first place.

20

said, look, this -- this litigation is very difficult.

21

It's difficult to engage in this litigation and produce a

22

-- a clear and reliable answer.

23

that the position you take forces us right back into that

24

litigation position that we tried to get away from in

25

Miranda itself.

Here, it's going to be a serious issue,

We -- we

It seems to me that --

2

MS. MITCHELL:

Well, two observations on that,

Your Honor.

3

First, the Court has not really ever gotten away

4

from the totality of the circumstances analysis.

5

Court has continued to employ it as the primary

6

analysis --

7

QUESTION:

But you want us to wade deeper.

8

You're -- you're absolutely right.

9

-- there's no easy way.

10

difficult.

11

wouldn't it?

12

The

There's -- there's no

But your way would make it more

Your -- your way would promote litigation,

MS. MITCHELL:

I -- I don't know that I agree

13

with that because I don't see this as different from where

14

you are in Harris where you still have to do a full-blown

15

analysis of voluntariness.

16

the two-prong analysis that is done in every case where

17

voluntariness is at issue because you have the warnings

18

and then, arguably, the totality of the circumstances

19

analysis is somewhat easier.

20

situation such as Harris, where you're making on the front

21

end a determination on voluntariness, I think it is very,

22

very similar to what -- what we are suggesting here.

23

QUESTION:

It is somewhat different than

But, nevertheless, in a

Ms. Mitchell, do you take the

24

position that we have to conduct a voluntariness inquiry

25

in -- as to the second statement -8

MS. MITCHELL:

QUESTION:

MS. MITCHELL:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- after the warnings were given?
Yes.

You agree with that.
Absolutely.

And in doing that, do you think that

7

the officer's use of the initial confession to get the

8

defendant to admit what went on is irrelevant to that

9

voluntariness inquiry --

10

MS. MITCHELL:

11

QUESTION:

12

-- or just that it isn't sufficient

to determine the outcome?

13

MS. MITCHELL:

QUESTION:

15

I think it --

What -- what is your position

exactly?

16
17

I would not --

MS. MITCHELL:
determine the outcome.

QUESTION:

19

MS. MITCHELL:

I think it is not sufficient to
I would not say it is irrelevant.

But it is relevant in the inquiry.
I would not say it's irrelevant

20

because I think, as the Court has looked at totality of

21

the circumstances and what is necessary to show coercion,

22

basically the Court has looked, I believe, at two

23

elements:

24

coercive, and the effect on the individual considering

25

their personality, character traits, and so forth.

the conduct of the officer and if it is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In

1

Elstad, when -- in talking about the effect of the cat out

2

of the bag on the individual, the Court talked about some

3

subjective disadvantage that the individual might have,

4

and so I suppose that type of analysis could lump that

5

within the characteristics of the individual that the

6

Court would look at in determining a totality of the

7

circumstances analysis.

8
9

QUESTION:

I -- I don't -- I don't understand

your -- your position on that point.

It -- it seems to me

10

that if there has been no coercion in the first

11

confession, how could -- how could it possibly be relevant

12

to whether the second confession is voluntary, whether

13

there had been a prior admission?

14

MS. MITCHELL:

15

I don't think it can control,

Your Honor, and I don't --

16

QUESTION:

I didn't say control.

How could it

17

possibly be relevant?

18

relevant is whether Miranda was observed, which has

19

nothing to do with whether it was necessarily involuntary.

20

Unless you're saying what is

MS. MITCHELL:

And I suppose I would draw the

21

distinction between the questioning and the answer, which

22

I think is a distinction this Court drew in Elstad as

23

well.

24

the subsequent statement, and certainly I would agree with

25

what you're saying.

I don't think the questioning is relevant at all to

When there's no coercion, it should
10

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not -- there's no taint that carries forward.

2

But if it is to be considered at all -- and

3

perhaps it shouldn't be, but in a totality of the

4

circumstances analysis, if there is a reference back and

5

the Court wants to consider that as part of the totality,

6

it seems to me the Court might look at from the

7

perspective of whether it in some way affects the

8

individual.

9

QUESTION:

What -- what you're inviting courts

10

to do is to say, well, he wouldn't have made the second

11

confession had he not made the first one which was

12

unwarned under Miranda and therefore the second one is

13

also presumptively -- that's what you're inviting.

14

MS. MITCHELL:

I don't think so.

That -- that

15

fact alone could never carry the day, and I think that was

16

made very, very clear in Elstad where that was --

17

QUESTION:

Of course, it can't carry the day,

18

but it's -- it's one of the totality of the circumstances.

19

Right?

20

MS. MITCHELL:

Correct.

But just the reference

21

back I don't believe makes it any -- really affects it or

22

makes it any -- any different than the fact that the cat

23

has already been let out of the bag --

25

QUESTION:
question?

May I ask you just a broader

Is there anything -- if your submission is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

correct, is there any reason why a police department

2

should not adopt a policy that said, never give Miranda

3

warnings until a suspect confesses?

4

MS. MITCHELL:

I think -- I think there are lots

5

of reasons why -- why police departments would not do

6

that.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. MITCHELL:

9

Why not?
There is a risk associated with

taking this type of an approach, and as our officer

10

indicated here, he was rolling the dice.

He did not

11

indicate that he did this in every single interrogation

12

he -- he --

So what has he got to lose is what I

have to understand.

15

MS. MITCHELL:

Well, what officers want when

they do an interrogation generally is an admissible

statement for all purposes, not for some limited purpose.

25

And so what they are looking for is to maximize that
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

possibility, and they know that -- that the vast majority

2

of people, according to studies, percentage-wise do in

3

fact waive and give a statement.

4

by not giving the warnings on the front end, is that that

5

alone will become a factor in the analysis in determining

6

whether or not that first statement was voluntary.

QUESTION:

What they risk then is,

If

that you're asking for here, other than this factor.

10

And then that gets back to the question I want

11

to ask and I think it bears on what you're telling Justice

12

Stevens.

13

what significance do we attach to an earlier unwarned

14

statement?

Can you tell me what relevance, what weight,

circumstances?

In and of --

It is a factor in the totality of the

Is that -- is that what you're telling us?

MS. MITCHELL:

No.

What I'm saying is in this

19

-- as in this case, where there is a reference back, I

20

think the Court could look at that as one factor when it's

21

determining totality of the circumstances and whether the

22

statement is voluntary or not.

23

had been previous interrogation or previous questioning

24

without warnings in and of itself I do not believe, under

25

any circumstances, could carry forward.

Just the fact that there

When you say reference back, Ms.

Mitchell, you mean the interrogator refers back to the --

QUESTION:

MS. MITCHELL:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- earlier statement.
As occurred in this case.

And the reference back could cause it

-- could cause the later statement to be involuntary

8

because?

9

MS. MITCHELL:

Well, I don't think it would

10

cause the -- the statement to be involuntary in and of

11

itself, but --

12

QUESTION:

I know not in and of itself, but it

13

-- it tends to show that the prior statement -- that the

later statement is involuntary.

that, it's irrelevant.

show that?

17

MS. MITCHELL:

Unless it tends to show

Now, why is it that it tends to

I think if the Court were to

18

consider that, it would be one factor bearing on how the

19

other circumstances or other parts of the police conduct

20

affected that individual because in the analysis in

21

Elstad, the Court looked at this question of the effect on

22

the individual of having spoken before.

that makes the second one involuntary.

MS. MITCHELL:

And you think that

I don't think that makes the

Well, I don't think it does either.

7

MS. MITCHELL:

8

QUESTION:

I don't --

And if it doesn't, I don't see how it

9

can at all be relevant.

10

MS. MITCHELL:

Well, Your Honor, if the Court is

11

looking at the totality of the circumstances, what we're

12

saying is that may be one circumstance the --

13

QUESTION:

When we said totality of the

14

circumstances, I -- I had always thought we meant totality

15

of the relevant circumstances, you know, not whether it's

16

a Tuesday afternoon or not.

17

QUESTION:

Is time relevant?

Suppose as soon as

18

the officers got what they wanted from Mrs. Seibert, they

19

didn't give her a 20-minute break to have a cigarette,

they said, fine, we got it.

1

QUESTION:

Suppose it had been one continuous

2

episode, but in the middle of it, they gave her Miranda

3

warnings.

4

MS. MITCHELL:

We do not believe that that would

5

make any difference, Your Honor.

6

in Elstad, a waiver that is otherwise voluntary and

7

knowing is not ineffective for some specific period of

8

time simply because there was prior interrogation.

9

QUESTION:

As this Court indicated

It's -- it's simply that the closer

10

the interrogation, the less likely that there is in fact a

11

voluntary waiver.

12

MS. MITCHELL:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

13

because what -- what you're looking at to determine if

14

there's a voluntary waiver is whether the individual had

15

the information, specifically the legal information, they

16

needed to make a decision.

17

warnings and -- and in a way that clearly communicates

18

their rights to them, and then they have an opportunity to

19

make a decision.

20

QUESTION:

That is giving them their

No, but it's -- it's more than simply

a -- I mean, there's -- there's no question that the --

that the crucial element is a decision made with

appreciation of legal rights.

element is that the decision to waive them be voluntary.

It would be relevant if we were doing an

Two, I think if you look at cases such as Bayer,

15

this Court has indicated that, you know, once the cat is

16

out of the bag, the cat is out of the bag.

17

if you want to look at it that way, it always has some

18

lingering effect, but that is not sufficient to make the

19

second statement involuntary.

20

is --

QUESTION:

And perhaps,

So how long that break

Do you know -- do you know why we --

22

we have the common phrase, I think I'll sleep on it?

23

have that phrase because we're -- we're likely to make a

21

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
An officer's failure to give Miranda warnings

22

before taking an initial statement does not presumptively

23

taint the admissibility of a subsequent statement that has

24

been preceded by Miranda warnings and an express waiver of

25

Miranda rights.

And the reason is that the risk of
18

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

compulsion that is inherent in unwarned custodial

2

interrogation and that makes the first statement

3

inadmissible is counteracted once Miranda warnings have

4

been given.

5

QUESTION:

May I ask whether you -- you to

6

comment on one -- what if we required that the second

7

warning include a statement that you realize what you said

8

up to now would be inadmissible in your trial?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That is exactly the requirement

10

that this Court rejected in Elstad, and the only

11

difference between this case and in Elstad identified by

12

the Missouri Supreme Court is that here the initial

13

failure to warn was intentional.

14

intentionality adds nothing to the level of compulsion

15

that is experienced by the suspect during the initial

16

interrogation.

17

that operates on the suspect who has confessed once as a

18

result of unwarned -- during unwarned questioning and the

19

giving and subsequent administration of Miranda warnings

20

is no less effective in providing the information that is

21

necessary to make a knowing and voluntary decision --

22

And the -- the fact of

It adds nothing to the psychological force

QUESTION:

That's -- that's what's not clear to

23

me, that -- that -- it seems to me you're absolutely on

24

the right track in saying that Miranda has, as one of its

25

basic purposes, dealing with cases where there may or may
19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not be compulsion.

2

the risk, so that that's a very good way of describing it.

3

We're not sure.

And this gets rid of

And then it seems to me in this kind of case we

4

have two risks.

One was the risk that really it was

5

compelled -- the first statement.

6

that really that first statement does lead to the second

7

confession.

And second is the risk

8

And so to obviate those risks, would it make

9

sense to say in any case where the police knowingly or

10

reasonably should have known they're supposed to give

11

Miranda warnings in the first case, you can use the second

12

statement but only if the government shows that, first of

13

all, that first one wasn't compelled?

14

that the Miranda warning was given before the second.

15

third, it shows that a time has to have elapsed sufficient

16

to make that Miranda warning reasonable, reasonably

17

cutting the causal connection that you want it to cut.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Second, it shows
And

No, Justice Breyer.

Because?
Because start with Elstad which

21

rejected any requirement of a break.

And -- and Elstad

22

also said that the risk of compulsion that is inherent in

23

the initial interrogation and that makes that inadmissible

24

is counteracted once the Miranda warnings have been given,

25

whether or not there has been a significant break between

2

the initial and the second interrogation.
Now let me address your question about

3

reasonable and knowing and whether that should make a

4

difference.

5

-- that this was a custodial interrogation situation, the

6

fact that the officer may have been unreasonable in

7

thinking it was not -- neither of those adds anything to

8

the level of compulsion that is experienced by the suspect

9

during the initial --

10

The fact that the warnings were known, that

QUESTION:

It does not.

You're right, but what

11

it does do is provide a tremendous incentive for the

12

police to run around the Miranda warning, and when they

13

run around it, we could get back, if they do it enough,

14

into the circumstances before Miranda that were bad

15

circumstances and called for Miranda.

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But the difference between this

17

situation and Miranda is that what Miranda addressed was a

18

situation where you were relying solely on a voluntariness

19

inquiry to determine whether the statements that were

20

admitted were compelled.

21

that there is an unacceptable risk in that situation when

22

all you're relying on is the totality of the circumstances

23

that a compelled statement will be admitted.

24

situation, you are not relying --

It's -- it can be.

Anyone reading the Miranda decision

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It means don't inform of

Justice Ginsburg, how I -- how I

13

would describe it is that you are required to give Miranda

14

warnings if the government is going to be able to

15

introduce this -- the statements as substantive evidence

16

of the defendant's guilt.

17

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Gornstein, you're just

18

making a different compelled inquiry.

Now you're not

19

asking whether the warned statement was compelled, but

20

you're asking in every case whether the earlier statement

21

was compelled so that you'd have the police have a policy

22

of always refusing to give warning, but say, well, don't

23

question him for more than 8 or 9 hours or something like

24

that because you run the risk of compulsion.

25

to me you're going to get that same factual inquiry with

respect to the earlier statement that Miranda was designed

2

to prevent -- to avoid with respect to the later

3

statement.

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But the difference, Justice

5

Stevens, is that -- that yes, there will be inquiry into

6

the voluntariness of the first statement and the second

7

statement, but the difference is that the only statement

8

that is being admitted is the second statement.

9

that's --

11

QUESTION:

And

But you -- you agree that's

inadmissible if the earlier one was compelled.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

would be a --

MR. GORNSTEIN:

from the evidence the first statement was not merely

21

presumptively compelled but actually compelled.

Justice Stevens, is you would look to a taint analysis to

2

see whether other additional factors cured the initial

3

compulsion and made the second statement voluntary.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Gornstein --

5

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But what -- what I -- I'm sorry.

6

QUESTION:

Please finish your answer.

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I -- I just wanted to get this

8

one -- one thing answered which is that when you are

9

looking at the second statement and admitting it, you --

10

it is a statement that has been preceded by Miranda

11

warnings.

12

There's a finding of voluntariness of the first, a finding

13

of voluntariness of the second, and as to that statement

14

at that point, there simply is not an unacceptable risk

15

that that statement has been compelled.

16

There is an express waiver of Miranda rights.

And on the other hand, there is a serious cost

17

to the administration of justice when you exclude from the

18

jury's consideration what -- a statement that is warned

19

and voluntary and very highly probative evidence of the

20

defendant's guilt.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Gornstein, you in -- in the

22

answer you just finished giving and I think throughout

23

your argument, you were making -- I think you were making

24

the assumption that there are two inquiries that should be

25

made in the situation that you envision.

One is the

1

voluntariness of the first statement, the unwarned

statement.

3

statement, following the warnings.

4

there is a third inquiry and that is the voluntariness of

5

the waiver?

Second is the voluntariness of the second

MR. GORNSTEIN:

QUESTION:

8

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Do you agree that

Yes.

Okay.
There has to be an inquiry into

10

That is for sure.

11

pressure the suspect, as the Court said in Elstad, to

12

force a waiver, then that would invalidate the subsequent

13

statement.

14

And if the officer does anything to

QUESTION:

And -- and don't you think that the

15

-- the situation presented by this kind of case -- for

16

18

21

to say as a general rule that following a systematic

22

interrogation, there is less likelihood of a truly

23

voluntary waiver of the right to silence than in the

24

Elstad situation?

25

Because Elstad did not involve a

MR. GORNSTEIN:

This did.

Isn't it fairly true

25

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

to say is if it has crossed over into compulsion, yes.

2

But if all there is is a risk of compulsion and -- and

3

that's what makes the first statement inadmissible, then

whether or not there's a greater risk in the second

situation of compulsion than the first --

I'm trying to keep it simpler.

I grant you that if there was compulsion, the risk is

greater.

into the question and making a final determination of

I --

I'm -- I'm suggesting that without having to get

10

whether we're going to label the first statement a subject

11

of compulsion or not, isn't the very fact that there has

12

been a systematic interrogation in a case like this a fact

13

that makes it less likely, not more likely, that the --

14

that the Miranda waiver, when it comes, will not be a

15

voluntary waiver?

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The longer the interrogation,

17

that makes it relevant to the inquiry.

warnings have been given, that is sufficient to cure any

19

risk of compulsion no matter how high.

What do you mean by a systematic

that it cited cases where there had been a systematic

Isn't that the whole point of

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Not in all circumstances, and I

11

-- I think sometimes, especially what the Missouri Supreme

Court said there's a risk to this practice.

13

when officers engage in this practice to locate physical

14

evidence, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem for the

15

Missouri Supreme Court.

16

For instance,

But in Elstad, this Court cited, for instance,

17

United States v. Pierce out of the Fourth Circuit and for

18

the proposition that the more in the without more test of

Elstad -- the more would be a thorough custodial

more, where there's a simple failure to administer

warnings without more --

QUESTION:

It

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

that there's going to be a statement after the Miranda

2

warning if there's been a -- for your -- to use your term,

3

a systematic interrogation before.

4

that we have the empirical data to say that the defendant

5

would be more likely to talk after he's been questioned

6

and the Miranda warning comes late.

I'm -- I'm not sure

7

Is that what is behind your -- your argument?

8

And if so, is -- is that something on which we can act?

Suppose that he is more likely to give a statement after

there's been a systematic interrogation.

12

MS. BARTHOLOW:

So what, if it's

Well, Your Honor, the -- in

13

Elstad, this Court cited Westover which the cardinal fact

of Westover, as you said in Mosley, was that the failure

of police officers to give any warnings whatsoever to the

at the outset?

3

psychology that Elstad told us that we really should not

4

be speculating about.

5

These are -- these are matters of

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Well, Miranda -- and in

6

Dickerson it cited this portion of Miranda where it said

7

custodial interrogations by their very nature generate

8

compelling pressures which work to undermine the

9

individual's will to resist and compel him to speak when

10

he wouldn't otherwise do so freely.

11

QUESTION:

The question I think -- or at least

12

mine is that if you're talking psychology, the policeman

13

who knows from nothing, never heard of Miranda,

14

accidentally says, did you commit the fire?

15

That statement doesn't come in.

16

it again after the right warning.

17

Case two.

Yes.

Okay?

And then later on he asks
That's case one.

The policeman, knowing everything

18

about Miranda, thinks to himself, ha, ha, ha, I've got a

19

great trick here.

20

Yes.

21

after warnings.

22

Did you commit the crime, the fire?

And then later on he asks him the question again

In terms of the psychology of the defendant

23

answering the second time, whether that policeman was a

24

fool or a knave seems beside the point.

25

if -- if your whole argument is one of psychology, I don't

argument than just the psychology of the -- the criminal

or the defendant -- the criminal defendant the second

5

Now, that's -- maybe there's more to your

And if so, I want you to respond to that.
MS. BARTHOLOW:

Well, Your Honor, I think we're

worried about suspects being coerced and compelled into

7

giving statements that aren't according to their free

8

will.

about?

MS. BARTHOLOW:

MS. BARTHOLOW:

15

Both.

Both, okay.

How does the first work?

I'm not sure I understand the

QUESTION:

If in fact you're worried about

16

policemen subtly coercing the first statement, why do you

17

have to stop admission of the second statement?

18

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Well, the first statement is

19

automatically excluded pursuant to Miranda.

The reason

20

why we need to exclude the second statement as well is

21

because by using the first statement, by referring back to

22

the first statement, also by pressuring the waiver to get

23

the second statement, it's not as clear as it would

24

normally be that the second statement is voluntary after

It's true if -- if we accept that --

that the first statement was pressured out of her.

here is the belief that it was not coercion in the first

instance.

9

the first instance, the case is over.

I think everybody agrees if it was coerced in
Is that what you

10

mean by pressured out of her, or -- or the mere -- the

11

mere failure to give Miranda warning constitutes pressure?

12

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I don't think the mere failure

13

to administer the warning may create the pressure, but

14

it's when the officer embarks upon the -- the specific

15

questioning and interrogation to get -- deliberately

16

elicit an incriminating response, then you have this type

17

of coercive environment or coercive manner of questioning

18

that Elstad was concerned with.

19

Elstad's opinion cited Pierce and Westover for the types

20

of questioning that would necessarily or -- or run the

21

great risk of coercing the defendant into confessing.

22

QUESTION:

And I think that's why

Well, and -- and if it did coerce,

23

then -- then Elstad said its rule would not apply.

Elstad only saying that when this exists, there may be

possible a finding of actual coercion, but it's -- it's

exists or -- or making a total exception from the rule

that it laid down for situations in which there was what

4

you call -- what -- what do you call it?

5

interrogation or programmed interrogation?

6

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Orderly

I'm just looking at the language

7

of Elstad and when it said it's an unwarranted extension

8

of Miranda, it was saying just the simple failure to

9

administer the warnings unaccompanied by the actual

10

coercive tactics or the manner of questioning when that is

11

coercive or if -- if the environment that it's being done

12

in is coercive, such as the, you know, station house, then

13

-- then there would be no presumption, then the second

14

statement wouldn't be compelled.

15

factors, when there's the great risk that it's being --

16

that the statement is being made under the threat of

17

coercion or pressure or where the environment is -- is

18

coercive, then you do have the presumption.

19

QUESTION:

But when you have those

Well, when it speaks of coercive

20

environment or coercive tactics, I -- I assumed that what

21

it meant is that the prior confession was coerced.

22

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe

23

that under Miranda when the Court said that the custodial

24

-- custodial interrogation exerts inherently coercive

25

pressure, I think that means when they question and

compelling, and --

QUESTION:

Well then, why have we allowed

4

admission of so many statements, you know, impeachment,

5

public -- public interest, that sort of thing, that result

6

from a situation where there weren't Miranda warnings

7

given if -- if simply station house interrogation always

8

produces coercion?

9

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Because there, Your Honor, I

10

think that the Court was balancing the interest of law

11

enforcement against the interest of allowing a suspect to

12

get on the stand and later lie at trial.

13

truth-seeking function of the trial, which is greatly

14

impacted here because here --

QUESTION:

We -- we would not balance if there

16

were actual coercion.

19

It affected the

MS. BARTHOLOW:

You don't bend the law into

In -- in terms of whether you're

20

going to admit the second statement, in the presence of

21

the potential for coercion or actual coercion, then the

22

burden needs to shift to the State.

23

these tactics that generate the risk of compulsion, they

24

need to show that that risk never manifested itself.

coercion, coercion.

3

Coercion, in -- in the sense we've used it in the Fifth

Those are different things.

But you're using it in a different

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I'm saying that if in this

12

QUESTION:

But -- but no lower court has found

13

that the statement was actually coerced or that the

14

confession -- the statement was involuntary because of

15

tactics of the government.

16

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Well, I believe the Missouri

Supreme Court found that only in circumstances other than

18

these would that first statement have been found

found the waiver involuntary in citing the Westover-type

No actual coercion.
The trial court didn't make any

8
9

QUESTION:

The -- all it

Wasn't given, and the reason that the

supreme court felt that it had to be suppressed was

10

because the decision not to give Miranda was an

11

intentional decision by the officer.

12

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I believe that was part of the

13

analysis, but the reason they found the waiver involuntary

14

was because of the continuous nature of the interrogation,

15

and it cited the Westover-type cases for that.

16

QUESTION:

What about -- suppose our reason --

We took the -- we took the case to

does make a difference because it -- it impels the police

2

officer into using tactics that otherwise wouldn't be

3

permissible, such as referring to the unwarned statement

4

to get a waiver --

5

QUESTION:

Well, I would have thought you'd look

6

at what happened in the second discussion after Miranda

7

warnings were given to determine whether it was voluntary

voluntary waiver of those rights given at the second

statement?

Was there a knowing and

Isn't that the proper inquiry?
MS. BARTHOLOW:

I believe it is, Your Honor.

I

-- and that's why I -- I went back to the Missouri Supreme

13

Court's opinion where they found that the waiver was

involuntary based on the totality of the circumstances in

the interrogation, that the --

QUESTION:

But -- but the question presented is

QUESTION:

I mean, we disagree

Well, as I -- may I interrupt you and

ask you to -- whether this distinction captures your case?

16

I -- I have understood you to be saying that the -- the

17

first statement was -- was coercive in the sense that

18

Miranda spoke of a custodial interrogation as being

19

inherently coercive.

20

coerced in the sense that it was the product of beating

21

him over the head with a 2 by 4.

22

you have been saying, look, any unwarned Miranda -­

23

unwarned statement that is given in custody shares the --

24

the character that Miranda said it had, inherently

25

coercive atmosphere.

It was not, on the other hand,

And as I understand it,

But that doesn't mean the same thing

as -- as coercion carried to the point of hitting him over

the head.

your argument, or am I putting words in your mouth?

4

Is that the distinction that -- that underlies

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I don't believe that what the

5

police officers did here would have rise -- rose to the

6

level of Fourth Amendment due process involuntariness, no.

7

But I do believe it violated the Fifth Amendment bar on

8

coerced, compelled testimony.

9

QUESTION:

To go to the question that I think

10

was presented, let's make my assumptions and let me

11

overstate a little bit.

12

My first assumption is it's intolerable to have

13

policemen going around purposely -- purposely -- violating

14

the Miranda rule.

15

know it's arguable.

16

Now, assume that conclusion, though I

Now, if that happens, if they deliberately and

17

purposely have not given these warnings when they knew

18

they should, that would create a situation where they

19

might do it a lot and we'd have a lot of coerced

20

confessions we couldn't ever prove.

21

that -- let's call it bad.

22

(Laughter.)

23

QUESTION:

All right.

Okay?

So I consider

Now, if -- if we make

24

that assumption, then the question is, well, can the

25

police, nonetheless, introduce a second statement that was
41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

done after warnings?

2

positions:

3

Now, there are three possible

always, never, and sometimes.
So I'm exploring the sometimes.

Now, I want to

4

know if -- what kind of a rule might you think was okay on

5

the sometimes.

6

Now, one thing I thought of is if they can show

7

-- not you, but the prosecutor can show that that first

8

statement taken was not coerced and that, second, they

9

really gave the warnings the second time, and that, third,

10

something happened to cut that causal connection because

11

the average person would think, of course, I've got to say

12

what I said before, otherwise they're going to do

13

something really terrible to me.

14

what -- now, I'm looking for passage of time, I'm looking

15

for something else to cut the causal connection.

16

All right?

So -- so

But I'm looking really for your view on this.

17

If the answer is sometimes, if the answer is never, but if

18

it is sometimes, what kind of a sometimes?

19

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I believe that sometimes the

20

second statement may be admitted, and that's what Elstad

21

said.

22

that it could be dispelled.

23

Even in the presence of actual coercion, they said

QUESTION:

Okay.

And -Sometimes you say it could.

24

Now, what kinds of things would dispel it and what isn't

25

dispelled about your case?

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I think if there was a passage

2

of time, it would dispel it, and that certainly didn't

3

occur here.

4

minute break by the time the police stopped questioning

5

and the FBI started questioning, and that came out at oral

6

argument.

7

was a break.

8
9

Even in Westover, there was a 15- to 20-

Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall said there
So there was no break here.

QUESTION:

Is that enough?

If -- if there's an

interval, same place, same officers, but it -- is

10

everything -- everything turn on how much time there is in

11

between the two?

12

MS. BARTHOLOW:

I'm not sure it could entirely

13

turn on that, but for instance, if questioning had

14

occurred the next day, I believe that would be a -- a

15

sufficient break.

16

cited another of our State cases, State v. Wright, where

17

this exact thing happened, questioning occurred and then a

18

day passed, and then questioning occurred again, and that

19

was sufficient to break the causal link.

20

And I think the Missouri Supreme Court

I think if officers embarking on this type of

21

calculated, unwarned questioning then add to their

22

warnings, when they finally give them, that what you said

23

can't be used against you, if they would have added that,

24

that might have helped an attenuation analysis.

25

think clearly none of that occurred here.

But I

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I think the -- another problem with this case

2

and this type of tactic is that it affects the truth-

3

seeking function of the trial, the jury, and what it's

4

finding because the first thing the jury hears is when the

5

tape is played and they hear immediately a waiver of

6

rights and --

7

QUESTION:

Let -- let me interrupt you for just

8

a minute, Ms. -- is -- is it agreed that the break here

9

was 20 minutes?

10

majority opinion says.

11
12

That's what the Supreme Court of Missouri

MS. BARTHOLOW:
minutes.

I believe it was 15 to 20

20 minutes, if according to the court, yes.

13

QUESTION:

Thank you.

14

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Going back to the truth-seeking

15

function of the jury, when the jury is listening to the

16

statement, they are presuming that she immediately waived

17

her rights.

18

and the only way that we can challenge that and show that

19

maybe this confession shouldn't be given the weight that

20

it -- it otherwise would have is that she underwent this

21

lengthy interrogation.

22

for the -- before the jury is to show them that she, in

23

fact, made an unwarned statement.

24

precludes our ability to defend her by not being able to

25

show under what circumstances she ultimately made that

They know nothing of what occurred before,

And the only way we can bring that

And that -- it

waiver.
It also allows the -- the unwarned statement to

3

come in because on that tape recording you have the

4

officer mentioning that she made an unwarned statement,

5

and the jury is never supposed to hear that.

have the jury thinking, well, she made two statements.

would they have the incentive to make this standard

rights, so it doesn't make any difference.

to me to actually help your side.

And the answer I thought was that if you're

Yes, Your Honor.

But that seems

And -- and I

8

guarantee you that if this Court says that this practice

9

is okay, it will become embedded in police procedure just

10

like Miranda has been because the police --

11

QUESTION:

If -- if the answer is if they're

12

going to waive, they're going to waive, then there's no

13

reason why not they don't give the warning at the outset.

14

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Exactly.

I mean, they have more

15

incentive not to warn, especially because they talked to

16

her before on two occasions.

17

tape recorded her interview with them on the -- February

18

14th, hoping that she would make some sort of

19

incriminating statement, and when she didn't, then they

20

engaged in this practice to subject her to the intense

21

custodial interrogation to try and get the -- the warning

22

from her.

23

confession from her.

24

because they were afraid she might invoke.

25

this Court in Escobedo said, you know, we shouldn't fear

They -- and I think they

But they weren't -- I mean -- excuse me -- the
But they weren't going to warn her

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that a suspect is going to assert her rights if she knew

2

about them.

3

QUESTION:

4

Miranda, wasn't it?

5

Escobedo was pretty much overruled by

MS. BARTHOLOW:

Yes, Your Honor, but I think the

6

-- that specific principle would remain and that this

7

Court would agree with that we should not have to fear

8

that a suspect will invoke their rights.

9

the whole premise of Miranda is that they have to be made

I mean, that was

10

aware of their rights so that they have the free will to

11

invoke them if -- if they are not willing to be subjected

12

to the intense pressure of the custodial interrogation.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Bartholow, you -- you've asserted

14

that the question presented is not -- is not really

15

accurate, that -- that the Missouri court, in fact, had

16

found that given the totality of the circumstances, one of

17

which was the intentional failure to give Miranda

18

warnings, the second statement was -- was coerced.

19

find that in fact that your brief in opposition did make

20

that point.

21

And I

Now, if -- if the question presented as set

22

forth in the petitioner's brief is not accurate, what do

23

you think would be accurate?

24

presents the question at least of whether the intentional

25

failure to give a Miranda warning is one of the factors

Would -- do you think it

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

properly considered in determining whether the second

2

confession is voluntary or not?

3

question, doesn't it?

4

MS. BARTHOLOW:

It at least presents that

I think it presents that

5

question.

I don't -- I don't think the Court should

6

proceed on the assumption that the initial statement was

7

voluntary, and that is -- that's always been our first

8

line of defense, is that this wasn't a voluntary statement

9

because under Elstad -- under Elstad the Court said that

10

when a suspect is being subjected to a coercive

11

environment or where the manner of the questioning in the

12

case is coercive, then the standard Elstad rule doesn't

13

apply.

14

And -- and especially because when Justice

15

Brennan tried to posit this two-step interrogation that it

16

would become all the rage and specifically -- I mean, the

17

description of Justice Brennan's two-step interrogation

18

mirrors this -- this exactly.

19

apocalyptic.

20

police officers or prosecutors to -- to use that tactic.

21

And -- and unfortunately, I believe law enforcement took

22

the invitation of Justice Brennan's dissent perhaps and

23

didn't listen to what you said in the majority opinion.

24
25

This Court said that's

We are not encouraging that.

We do not want

2

you to apply is that when police officers deliberately

3

withhold Miranda in order to elicit an incriminating

4

response when they knew or should have known that Miranda

5

was required, then the second statement will be presumed

6

compelled unless and until the State can show that it has

7

been attenuated from the first.

8

And if there --

9

QUESTION:

And the test that we would ask

Why does the intentionality or not of

10

the failure to give the Miranda warning have anything to

11

do with whether the second confession is voluntary or not?

12

I mean, I can understand why it's -- it's a nasty thing

13

and you don't want the -- you don't want the State to do

14

an end run around Miranda, as you understand Miranda, but

15

why does it have anything whatever to do with the coercive

16

-- with the coerced or non-coerced nature of the second

17

confession?

18

whether the failure to give it was -- was intentional or

19

non-intentional it seems to me.

20

they are allowed to do during the questioning session.

will use tactics that they used here, that they will refer

what difference does it make to the defendant?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN K. MITCHELL

8

Thank you, Ms. Bartholow.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. MITCHELL:

10

Thank you, Your Honor.

On the issue of systematic interrogation that

11

came up several times during the argument, that is

12

relevant only if it rises to the level of making that

13

first statement actually involuntary.

And I think that's

14

clear from the Elstad opinion itself.

At one point during

15

the Elstad opinion, specifically in footnote 2 of the

16

majority opinion, the Court is talking about lower court

17

decisions where the -- the lower court did not apply the

18

attenuation-type doctrine.

19

cases as involving, quote, clearly voluntary, unwarned

20

admissions, the Court then goes on and cites a number of

21

cases that involve actual station house interrogations, in

22

many cases much longer than the interrogation we have

23

here.

24

decision cited in Elstad.

25

And referring to some of those

Specifically, I'd point the Court to the Derrico

station house-type interrogation is not enough.

2

question is, does it render the first statement

3

involuntary and therefore capable of tainting the second

4

statement?

5

The

In this case the question of voluntariness of

6

each statement was raised in the initial motion to

7

suppress, and even though there were not extensive

8

findings by the trial court, they denied those motions to

9

suppress.

And that issue was not raised again in either

10

of the appellate courts in Missouri, and the Missouri

11

Supreme Court did not reach that issue.

12

On the question of what the Missouri Supreme

13

Court held, three points I think are very important.

14

court starts out by phrasing or -- or characterizing its

15

decision as such.

presumption that the first statement was involuntary

on and throughout the opinion makes the decision to, in

fact, carry that presumption forward.

20

intent and finds intent to be an improper tactic, as this

21

Court used that phrase in Elstad, which is the predicate

22

then for applying a fruits-type analysis and requiring

23

attenuation, which is exactly what the Missouri Supreme

24

Court does.

Justice Brennan's discussion in Elstad, Justice Brennan

2

talked about a number of situations, including the

3

application of Miranda to the Fourth Amendment, including

4

the use of statements by police officers to garner a

5

waiver which did not happen here, and other things that

6

are simply inapplicable.

7

This case is not that situation.

Finally, what we are asking this Court to do is

8

to reverse the Missouri court decision that focused on

9

intent, deterrence, and the carrying forward of the

10

presumption to taint the subsequent statement because each

11

of those findings are inconsistent with this Court's

12

holding in Elstad, and instead to apply the framework of

13

Elstad to this case and to reverse.

14

If there are no further questions.
