CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Owen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. OWEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This case presents the question whether

11

mitigating evidence of a 67 IQ, of permanent cognitive

12

impairment, could be given mitigating effect under the old

13

Texas capital sentencing statute.

14
15

QUESTION:

Mr. Owen, am I correct in thinking

that Smith's case is no longer before us?

16

MR. OWEN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Thank you.

18

MR. OWEN:

This Court in Penry held that the

19

deliberateness question -­

20

QUESTION:

May I ask another preliminary

21

question?

22

certificate of appealability was properly denied.

23
24
25

I thought that what was at issue is whether the

MR. OWEN:

That is in the questions presented,

Your Honor, and -­
QUESTION:

Because you seem to be asking us to

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

grant habeas relief, and I would have thought what we had

2

to consider was the denial of the certificate of

3

appealability.

4

Am I right?

MR. OWEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that in

5

this case the question of the underlying merits of the

6

constitutional issue before the Court, it -- I don't want

7

to say merges, but it certainly overlaps with the question

8

about the certificate of appealability and -­

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- that's true of all

certificate of -- of appealability cases, isn't it?
MR. OWEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But it was also

12

true in Penry II, which when it came to this Court, came

13

from the Fifth Circuit on a denial of COA, and this Court

14

resolved the merits in that case by examining the merits

15

of the underlying State court decision and reversed the

16

judgment in the case in exactly the same fashion that we

17

are asking the Court to do in our case.

18

QUESTION:

Well, as long as we're into these

19

preliminary matters -- and then I'll let you, so far as

20

I'm concerned, proceed the way you wish.

21

in this case, isn't it, if -- if we say there should be a

22

COA, the Fifth Circuit is just going to follow its -- its

23

earlier panel opinion, and I -- I assume it must on -- on

24

the nexus rule.

25

MR. OWEN:

It is true that

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

I

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think that the -- in fact, in -- within the last couple of

2

years, the Fifth Circuit has taken those rules en banc and

3

has issued an en banc opinion that applies and upholds not

4

just the nexus rule, but the other elaborate sort of

5

framework of the Penry doctrine that we've explained in

6

our brief.

7

So I think you're exactly right, that if the

8

Court grants a COA and returns this case to the Fifth

9

Circuit, it will be back here in 6 months because all the

10

Fifth Circuit panel could do is say it's controlled by the

11

circuit precedent.

12

well, Your Honor, if the Court concludes that those rules

13

are, in fact, not consistent with its cases, that the

14

shortest route to resolving the case is to do so at this

15

time.

So I think in -- for that reason as

16

This Court in Penry I held that the

17

deliberateness question was not an adequate vehicle for

18

giving mitigating effect to a defendant's personal moral

19

culpability, and in this case it functioned exactly the

20

same way as it did in Penry.

21

dangerousness question, with respect to an IQ of 67, could

22

only give that evidence aggravating effect rather than

23

mitigating effect.

24

trial, particularly with respect to the arguments of

25

counsel respecting the evidence and how it might be

Also, the future

And in the entire context of this

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

treated by the jury, really makes clear the existence of

2

the Penry violation.

3

QUESTION:

May I ask you, Mr. Owen?

You are

4

claiming low IQ.

5

now -- you did not make a claim of retardation, just low

6

IQ.

7

is no Atkins claim in this case?

Is that still the -- there is no -- in other words,

8
9

You did not in -- in your papers up till

MR. OWEN:
Court, Your Honor.

There is no Atkins claim before this
That is correct.

We have filed a

10

successive application in State Court in order to preserve

11

Mr. Tennard's rights to have a determination of whether

12

he's a person with mental retardation.

13

at trial established only his very low IQ, not the other

14

aspects that would have been necessary for a diagnosis of

15

mental retardation.

16

this Court in this proceeding.

17

But the evidence

So there's no Atkins claim before

As I was saying, the arguments of counsel sort

18

of highlight the inadequacy of the jury instructions in

19

this case.

20

plea for nullification.

21

of the defendant's very low IQ in -- in imposing sentence,

22

but he couldn't provide them any sort of road map to tell

23

them how they could get from the low IQ to a no answer to

24

one of the special issues.

25

in replying to that argument, said the low IQ is not even

Defense counsel's argument was effectively a
He asked the jury to take account

For his part, the prosecutor,

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

relevant to the second special issue, and those were his

2

words:

not relevant.

3

So to some extent the State is trying to have it

4

both ways.

5

that this fact, a 67 IQ, wasn't relevant to the second

6

special issue.

7

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, it's respondent's

8

position that this evidence was sufficiently relevant to

9

the second special issue that the jury could be understood

10
11

At trial, the prosecution argued to the jury

Here, however, tracking the opinion of the

to have given it effect in imposing sentence.
QUESTION:

But do I understand that the -- that

12

the specific issue that we've got here, assuming we -- we

13

do reach the -- the merits issue as part of the COA

14

problem, is the specific circuit rule that there has got

15

to be a finding of, as I recall, unique severity and a

16

finding of causation.

17

circuit said was, because those conditions were not

18

satisfied, we ultimately do not even reach the kind of

19

Penry issue that -- that you described as being in the

20

background.

21

got in front of us?

22

MR. OWEN:

And as I understand what the

Is -- is that a fair statement of what we've

Yes.

Excuse me.

Yes, Your Honor.

23

That -- that is a fair statement, and I think that that is

24

exactly what the Fifth Circuit did with this case, was it

25

applied these preliminary doctrines which are effectively

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

threshold tests and they looked at this evidence and said,

2

it's not uniquely severe and there's been no showing that

3

it caused the defendant to commit the crime.

4

result, the Fifth Circuit never got to the question of how

5

does this evidence possibly fit into the special issues.

6

And as a

Because this is a habeas case and we want -­

7

we're trying to get the Court to -- to ultimately grant

8

relief, we wanted to explain why the underlying State

9

court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of

10

this Court's cases.

And the Court of Criminal Appeals

11

relied, on the one hand, on the unique severity idea.

12

They said this IQ score, standing alone, doesn't rise to

13

the level of mental retardation, so Penry is out of the

14

picture.

15

even if it was wrong about that judgment, there is some

16

way for the -- for the jury to have given it effect in

17

answering the second special issue.

And then it went on to say even if that's -­

18

QUESTION:

You say it doesn't have to be related

19

to the -- to the crime at all.

20

MR. OWEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

I mean, what -- how -- how can that

22

be?

I mean, what if they bring in evidence that this

23

person was severely dyslexic?

24

MR. OWEN:

I think -­

25

QUESTION:

I guess that's a great handicap and

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and you must feel sorry for the poor fellow, but what

2

does it have to do with mitigating the fact that he

3

murdered somebody?

4

that have anything to do with mitigating?

5

we're looking for here is mitigation.

6

it makes the act that he committed less heinous than it

7

otherwise would be.

8

Dyslexia should -- should count.

9

You know, how -- how does -- how does

MR. OWEN:

I mean, what

That means somehow

And you say it doesn't matter.

I think, Your Honor, that the -- the

10

wisdom of this Court's case in Lockett, the wisdom of the

11

Lockett decision is that that judgment, the judgment that

12

you're describing, is this in fact mitigating, does this

13

support a life sentence as opposed to the death penalty -­

14

QUESTION:

Suppose the defendant is despondent

15

over global warming and -- and that has nothing to do with

16

-- with the case.

17
18

Does the jury hear that too?

MR. OWEN:

I think, Your Honor, that -- that the

jury is the person -­

19

QUESTION:

I mean, there are no limits?

20

MR. OWEN:

There -- there shouldn't be any

21

limits on admission, Your Honor, or on the jury's ability

22

to give that evidence effect if it chooses to do so.

23

some level, we are -- we are left to the jury -- to trust

24

the jury's judgment about what -­

25

QUESTION:

At

This evidence was admitted, was it

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not?

2
3
4

MR. OWEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

There -- there

QUESTION:

So we're not talking evidence that

is -­

5

was excluded.

6

could be made of the evidence once it was in.

7

You're talking about whether -- what use

MR. OWEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, although

8

I should point out that to the extent that the lower

9

courts have, from time to time, described these threshold

10

rules, the nexus requirement, the severity requirement, as

11

relevance rules, rules of constitutional relevance, it at

12

least holds out the possibility that in a future case a

13

court might choose to exclude evidence as irrelevant to

14

punishment.

15

QUESTION:

Are there -- are there any other

16

areas where -- where we just say, you know, there -- there

17

are no rules at all.

18

fellow had a limp, and therefore, if you feel sorry for

19

him because he had a limp, that -- you can determine, even

20

though it clearly is not true that this somehow mitigates

21

his guilt for -- for the murder he committed.

22

MR. OWEN:

The jury -- whatever it likes.

The

I certainly think, Your Honor, that

23

suggesting that the jury could respond simply out of

24

sympathy or emotion or an unfocused passion is precluded

25

by the Court's cases, and the Court has approved any

number of -­

2

QUESTION:

Right.

So -- so what do you tell

3

them in order to prevent that?

4

MR. OWEN:

I think that what you tell them -­

5

QUESTION:

Don't you have to tell them what the

6

Fifth Circuit suggests?

You have to find that there's

7

some kind of a connection between this evidence and the

8

crime that he committed, that -- that, you know, it -- it

9

somehow caused it so that he's less guilty than somebody

10

that did not have that affliction would be.

11

isn't that exactly what you're looking for?

12

MR. OWEN:

No, Your Honor.

Isn't that -­

I -- I think that

13

what you have to tell the jury is that they are not

14

limited in responding to the evidence and that they should

15

give the evidence their reasoned moral response.

16

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that in -- in

17

most States under Lockett, the trial judge has no

18

discretion to say this is just too far outside the bounds

19

of what mitigation evidence really means?

20

MR. OWEN:

I think that the bounds that Lockett

21

sets are clear enough to -- to preclude some facts.

I

22

don't -- at this point, I don't have them in mind, but let

23

me say that the rule of Lockett, which is any fact about

24

the defendant's background or character or any of the

25

circumstances of the offense, that is -- I think that is a

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- that does provide sufficient guidance.

2

Certainly, Your Honor, every death penalty

3

statute in the country, including now Texas', gives the -­

4

the sentencer very broad latitude to consider the facts

5

and -­

6

QUESTION:

What about -- what about the other -­

7

the other factor that you say the Fifth Circuit shouldn't

8

have taken into account, that is, severity of the -- of

9

the factor that the defendant claims mitigates?

What -­

10

you say that -- that should not come into -- come into

11

consideration either.

12

MR. OWEN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

So he can -- he can tell the jury,

14
15
16
17

you know, I had a really bad cold that day.
MR. OWEN:

Let -- let me say, Your Honor, that

when -- that when the Court said -­
QUESTION:

Is it seriously we -- we have to let

18

the jury just ponder over that question, whether the fact

19

that he had a really bad cold -­

20
21

MR. OWEN:

I think the Court could be

confident -­

22

QUESTION:

-- should mitigate his crime?

23

MR. OWEN:

-- the jury would not ponder very

24

long over the question whether a serious cold meaningfully

25

reduced the defendant's culpability in a way that made a

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

life sentence appropriate.

2

QUESTION:

No, but by the same token, wouldn't

3

it be fair for the judge to say, no reasonable jury,

4

possessed of reasonable, human sympathy, could possibly

5

find this mitigating?

6

there would be no constitutional error.

7

correct?

8
9

MR. OWEN:

The bad cold could be kept out and
Isn't that

I think, Your Honor, that if no

reasonable juror could possibly accord the evidence any

10

significance to the ultimate sentencing decision, then it

11

would be consistent with Lockett because Lockett does

12

comprehend facts about the -­

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Okay.

But you're -- you're worried

about the other end of the spectrum.
MR. OWEN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

This is not

16

a case about a -- a defendant with a bad cold.

17

case about a defendant -­

This is a

18

QUESTION:

The circuit -- isn't -­

19

MR. OWEN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

The -- the question about what is a

21

mitigating circumstance would come up under Texas' current

22

instruction 2, the instruction that says that you can

23

consider all the mitigating evidence, consider all the

24

mitigating evidence.

25

a discrete question from the one that's before us.

What is mitigating evidence?

That's

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Whatever it is, it's a higher -- something higher than

2

mitigating evidence.

3

MR. OWEN:

That's right, Your Honor.

The -- the

4

severity test -- we don't know exactly how high it has to

5

be set because in only one case that I'm aware of has the

6

Fifth Circuit found it to be satisfied.

7

QUESTION:

So there are -­

Why is it higher than mitigating

8

evidence?

I don't understand.

I -- I thought you had

9

just acknowledged in -- in the -- in the exchange with

10

Justice Souter that a cold wouldn't be mitigating because

11

it was not severe enough.

Right?

12

MR. OWEN:

No.

13

QUESTION:

Oh, that isn't the reason.

14

MR. OWEN:

-- not because it was not severe

15

enough, Justice Scalia.

16

QUESTION:

I think -- I think -­

No.

I see.

Well, why -- why did you

17

agree with Justice Souter that a -- that a cold could be

18

excluded?

19

MR. OWEN:

Because I do think that -- that

20

Lockett anticipates that there are facts about the

21

defendant's character and background which, according to

22

tradition, according to our understanding of what

23

constitutes an appropriate basis for extending leniency,

24

which does not limit itself to evidence that has a nexus

25

with the crime, that -- that there would be room for a

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

judge to say, in an extreme case -- and I'm not saying

2

this would be a routine judgment.

3

Lockett suggests it would be only a very unusual case

4

where a trial court could say the proffered evidence -­

5

QUESTION:

I certainly think

Do you want to tell me why?

All I

6

asked is why.

What is -- what is it that brought you to

7

the judgment that a cold could be excluded?

8

not because it is too insignificant.

9

And you say it's not because it has no connection to the

That doesn't count.

10

-- to the criminal act that he committed.

11

brings you to say that it can be excluded?

12

MR. OWEN:

You say it is

What -- what

Because I don't think there's any

13

dimension on -- in which it is relevant to whether the

14

defendant deserves a life sentence or the death penalty.

15

QUESTION:

It's not relevant because of what?

16

MR. OWEN:

It's not relevant because it doesn't

17

reflect any -­

18

QUESTION:

Because -- because colds don't count

19

or, you know, what?

20

MR. OWEN:

No, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

I suggest that -- that the reason you

No.

I -­

22

feel it's -- it's not relevant is because either it's too

23

insignificant or it has no relation whatever to the act

24

that he committed, one or the other of those.

25

MR. OWEN:

Maybe both.

Well, I think that -- that if the

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court's -- let me back up and say that in any number of

2

cases, this Court has recognized as mitigating

3

circumstances which have no causal connection to the

4

crime.

5

of my head being your opinion, Justice Scalia, in

6

Hitchcock where the Court recognized that Mr. Hitchcock's

7

having been a fond and affectionate uncle to the children

8

of his brother was a fact which the sentencer had to be

9

allowed to consider in deciding whether he ought to get

10

The best example that I can think of off the top

the death penalty or some lesser sentence.

11

And so I think that at a minimum, adopting the

12

nexus test or the unique severity test would require the

13

Court to overrule all or part of a number of its cases,

14

going all the way back to Lockett, and that there

15

shouldn't be any basis for doing that since the Lockett

16

rule is working perfectly well in practice.

17

again -­

18

QUESTION:

I think

Mr. -- Mr. Owen, is this position of

19

the -- the severity and the nexus peculiar to the pre­

20

1991 sentences?

21

Circuit involving the new law that simply says the jury

22

can consider all mitigating evidence?

23

That is, have any cases come to the Fifth

MR. OWEN:

No, Your Honor, and -- and given this

24

Court's very clear approval of the new statute in Penry II

25

where this Court observed in passing that this new statute

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and its broad opportunity for the jury to consider

2

mitigation was a clearly drafted, catchall provision that

3

complies with Penry I, I don't anticipate that there could

4

be a challenge raised under the new statute.

5

The only universe of cases that we are talking

6

about is the universe of cases that were sentenced prior

7

to 1991 when Texas changed its statute, and -- and that is

8

a -- a small number of -- of cases.

9

percent of the people on Texas' death row were sentenced

10

Probably 85 to 90

under the new statute.

11

QUESTION:

May I ask you a -- a question about

12

the operation of the Texas rule?

13

that under the Texas rule, the evidence about how the

14

defendant was nice to his nieces and nephews would be

15

excluded?

16

MR. OWEN:

MR. OWEN:

Yes, Your Honor, because the nexus -­

consideration under the old future dangerousness question.

6

It has much broader consideration now under the new

7

statute, but I don't think it's ever been -- it's never

8

been the case that that -- that that evidence has been

9

excludable.

10

And it's all -- it can all be given mitigating

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what is wrong with the

11

nexus requirement then if it doesn't keep the evidence

12

out?

13

MR. OWEN:

Because it denies the defendant the

14

opportunity to have the jury -- it refuses to -- to allow

15

a new sentencing hearing for a defendant who comes to the

16

appellate court and says, at the time that I was

17

sentenced, I presented evidence that was clearly relevant

18

to my culpability, like a 67 IQ, and yet the jury wasn't

19

instructed in such a way that they could give it effect.

20

And the appellate court says, well, if you didn't show

21

that your 67 IQ caused you to commit the crime, then

22

you're not going to get that jury instruction.

23

there's no problem with your death sentence.

problem.

QUESTION:

That is the

So what's the rationale for the nexus

2

Circuit used to determine harmless error or?

3

It's a -- a sort of a screening process the Fifth

MR. OWEN:

No, Your Honor.

I think that the -­

4

the origin of the nexus language is in an attempt to

5

understand what this Court meant in Penry when it said

6

that evidence of a defendant's background and character is

7

relevant to punishment because crimes that are

8

attributable to bad background, mental problems, and so on

9

might deserve a less serious punishment.

And it is -- the

10

Fifth Circuit has seized on, focused on that word

11

attributable and from that elaborated this jurisprudence

12

of causal, deterministic relationship.

13

QUESTION:

Of course, in this case -- and I

14

guess in all -- all of the cases involving the -- the old

15

Texas instruction, the State court was proceeding not

16

under Penry II, but just under Penry I.

17

Penry II is the case that required full consideration be

18

given to all mitigating circumstances.

19

require that.

20

means of giving consideration to it.

21

And it didn't -­

Penry I didn't

It just said there had to be some -- some

MR. OWEN:

Actually, Your Honor, Penry I does

22

say full consideration.

23

Court said in Johnson that the test was not necessarily

24

full consideration but meaningful consideration.

25

In the -- in the interim, this

And so our position is that at the time the

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court of Criminal Appeals decided this case and said that

2

there was no need for an additional instruction, they -­

3

at a minimum, the test was Johnson's demand that there be

4

meaningful consideration and that under this set of

5

instructions, there was no way to give meaningful

6

consideration to the fact of a 67 IQ, and that that is the

7

-- that is the way in which the Court of Criminal Appeals

8

went astray.

9

And in fact, that's illustrated well, I think,

10

by the portions of the Court of Criminal Appeals opinion

11

that try to show how a jury, confronted with the future

12

dangerousness question, could figure out a chain of a

13

reasoning that would get you from this guy has a 67 IQ to,

14

therefore, we can answer no to the future dangerousness

15

question.

16

It is based on -- it is -- the -- the chain of

17

inferences that the Court of Criminal Appeals suggests is

18

contrary to the evidence that was presented at trial

19

because it relies on characterizations of Mr. Tennard as a

20

follower which are not in the evidence and aren't

21

supported by the evidence.

22

It is actually contrary to the arguments that

23

were made at trial because the prosecutor told the jury

24

that they wouldn't be allowed to consider what happened or

25

might happen in prison as a way of deciding the answer to

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the future dangerousness question.

2

And it's contrary to this Court's cases like

3

Boyde and Penry II where the Court says, in deciding

4

whether a jury was able to give effect to mitigating

5

evidence under the charge, you don't just look at the

6

language of the charge, but you look at the evidence, you

7

look at the arguments, you look at the context of the

8

whole trial.

9

covered up the context of the whole trial and said let's

10

see if we can imagine a trial with different evidence and

11

different arguments that might have produced a different

12

result.

13

not a fair reading of Penry.

14

fair judgment of whether the jury in this case was able to

15

give meaningful consideration to the fact of Mr. Tennard's

16

67 IQ.

kind of evidence?

2

MR. OWEN:

I think that what the -- what the

court would say is that you don't have to get to the

question of whether he showed a nexus because that's the

kind of evidence that has a natural home in the future

QUESTION:

Why does that have anything to do

with future dangerousness?

MR. OWEN:

I don't understand that.

Your Honor, I believe what the -- I

10

believe what Texas would say -- and I'm not saying -- this

11

is my view.

12

the abstract, good character evidence shows a lack of

13

dangerousness, and for that reason, it can be given effect

14

by returning a no answer to the future dangerousness

15

question.

But I think what Texas would say is that in

QUESTION:

Or -- or that he might revert back to

his good character in a way that someone who had never

shown it might not.

19

MR. OWEN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

In -­

20

in Boyde v. California, Your Honor observed that certain

21

evidence of good character could be understood as showing

22

that the crime is an aberration from otherwise good

23

character.

24
25

At the same time, Justice Stevens, I think that
it was -- it was correctly observed by the concurring

opinion in Franklin that there may be more relevance to

2

some of those circumstances than just the fact that it

3

doesn't make you dangerous.

4

But I think we are down the road from that

5

point, and our point is this evidence, the 67 IQ, is

6

evidence that a juror could reasonably conclude makes you

7

more dangerous, and in the absence of some additional

8

instruction, the jury simply had no vehicle for expressing

9

the -- the conclusion that even having killed deliberately

10

and even though this person poses a risk of future danger,

11

because of his reduced culpability as reflected in his 67

12

IQ, a life sentence is the appropriate sentence.

13

QUESTION:

Would anything do short of the

catchall that Texas has had since 1991?

culpability.

3

that definition, but I -- it is hard to hard imagine.

4

I am -- I -- I have tried to come up with

I actually think that the best, clearest, most

QUESTION:

And -- and we should -- that has to

19

MR. OWEN:

This Court in Bell v. Ohio, the

20

companion case to Lockett, said that Bell's low average

21

intelligence, or dull, normal intelligence, was a

22

mitigating factor that the sentencer had to be allowed to

23

consider.

24

IQ score for Mr. Bell ranged between 81 to 90, so we know

25

that 90 is something the jury has got to consider.

We know from the briefs in that case that the

1

In Burger v. Kemp, the Court observed that Mr.

Burger's 82 IQ was a -- was a mitigating circumstance

3

which the jury would have to be instructed to consider,

4

had it been offered by counsel.

5
6
7

We know from McKoy v. North Carolina that 74 is
an IQ that counts as a mitigating circumstance.
I think every reasonable juror would understand,

8

particularly when counsel is urging vigorously this is a

9

very low IQ, as counsel did in this case -- would

10

understand that it does substantially reduce moral

11

culpability.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD L. MARSHALL

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20

MR. MARSHALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is squarely controlled by the Court's

21

opinions in Graham v. Collins and Johnson v. Texas in

22

which the Court rejected Penry claims based on youth and

23

troubled upbringing.

24

In fact, Tennard's Penry claim, based on a

25

completely unexplained IQ score, is much weaker than

1

Graham's or Johnson's for two reasons.

2

claim is governed by the AEDPA, which requires deference

3

to the Texas court's reasoning in its opinion, and second,

4

Tennard's disembodied IQ score has really minimal

5

mitigating or aggravating significance within the special

6

issues here because -­

QUESTION:

First, Tennard's

not a case of -- of ineffective assistance of counsel

The evidence was entered, was admitted
And the question is whether or not it

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I -- I believe it was
Whether it was considered as -­

Well, but I mean, that's -- that's

16

quite apart from the fact that, you know, it may be

17

persuasive or not persuasive.

18

MR. MARSHALL:

It is apart from that question,

19

Justice Kennedy.

However, in this case, if you take a

20

look at counsel's strategy as a whole in -- in defending

21

this case, he basically decided to paint Tennard as the

22

less culpable party among his co-defendants and -- and

23

paint him as a follower in illustrating that he allowed

24

his prior rape victim to escape.

25

role in the murders in this case, that was his strategy.

In -- in questioning his

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Counsel certainly didn't believe, I -- I don't think from

2

the record, that -- that this IQ score had any independent

3

mitigating significance beyond that follower theory

4

because he didn't object to the -- the instructions or the

5

special issues that were given and -- and didn't attempt

6

to argue it outside of that context.

7

Everything that he placed before the jury was

8

the idea that Tennard was a follower in this case and that

9

that made him less culpable.

And that is a fact that is

10

mitigating within the context of future dangerousness, as

11

this Court reasoned in Jurek, where they said the duress

12

or domination of co-defendants would be cognizable within

13

that special issue.

14

Here, counsel presented the argument and -- and

15

some evidence to the effect that Tennard was a model

16

prisoner when he was incarcerated in his prior -- for the

17

prior rape conviction.

18

infractions.

19

not that he was -- that he had any kind of diminished

20

capacity to commit this offense.

21

He had no disciplinary

This was clearly counsel's global theory,

QUESTION:

Opposing counsel says, however, we

22

don't even have to get to that argument, that maybe if the

23

Fifth Circuit had considered the case aright, it would

24

agree with you on that point.

25

point.

But it never got to that

It applied its -- its two factors and therefore

1

never even had to consider what you're presenting to us.

2

It just said no causality and not -- not severe enough.

3

What -- what's your response to that?

4

MR. MARSHALL:

Justice Scalia, I -- I would say

5

that the Fifth Circuit was really looking at whether the

6

State court's opinion was reasonable in this case.

7

the State court did apply Penry in a way to try to

8

determine -- applied Johnson and Graham and tried to

9

determine whether this evidence was relevant within the

10

The -­

special issues as given and as defined.

11

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- do you think the

12

Fifth Circuit's uniquely severe, permanent handicap and

13

nexus tests are the proper interpretation of the Penry

14

cases?

15

MR. MARSHALL:

I believe, Justice O'Connor, that

16

they are one proper interpretation.

17

as a screening test of sorts to try to engender some sort

18

of consistency in the many, many, many Penry claims that

19

they -­

20

QUESTION:

They were developed

I mean, if we thought that the

21

certificate of appealability should have been granted, I

22

suppose you would then argue, when it went back, that

23

those are the right tests to employ?

24
25

MR. MARSHALL:

That would be one argument we

would advance, Justice O'Connor.

I -- that's sort of a

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

screening, a -- a prima facie analysis of -- of the Penry

2

claim and it's designed to handle a wide variety of types

3

of evidence offered.

4

QUESTION:

I -- I have a lot of trouble seeing

5

how the first uniquely severe, permanent handicap test is

6

-- is proper in light of Penry.

7

this case, is it not?

8
9

MR. MARSHALL:

That's a pretty low IQ in

We know now that it's a low IQ.

I -- I don't know whether the jury was aware of that fact

10

at the time of trial because it was never explained to

11

them, Your Honor.

12

other IQ score.

13

And it was never contrasted with any

However, I think the Fifth Circuit's opinion is

14

illustrative of -- of the difference between the -- the

15

four-part test that's identified in the Fifth Circuit for

16

determining Penry violations and the additional analysis

17

that goes on top of it, which is even aside from this

18

question of whether we have a nexus, whether we have a -­

19

whether we have severity or permanence, these other

20

factors, the court invariably ends up looking at whether

21

the jury could consider that evidence within the special

22

issues, whether it was relevant in -- in some way, in some

23

meaningful way.

24

identified in Johnson and in Graham that -- that should be

25

-- be the controlling factor in Penry cases.

And -- and that's the question the Court

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So I think -- I think the Eighth Amendment only

2

requires looking at Johnson and Graham, that -- that the

3

jury be able to give effect in some manner to the evidence

4

introduced, not that it be able -- not that it's required

5

to give effect in every conceivable way.

6

isn't really whether Tennard can identify some relevance

7

for this evidence beyond the special issues that were

8

given, but whether he can -- whether we can look at the

9

record and see if it had some relevance within those

10
11

And so the issue

special issues that was available to the jury.
And I think that's exactly what the State court

12

did in this case.

13

Tennard has argued in his brief, I think quite eloquently,

14

deliberateness was truly designed to deal with the

15

question of party liability.

16

reasonable expectation that death would occur.

17

They looked at deliberateness and as

Whether the defendant had a

18

given during the guilt/innocence phase, there was that

19

lingering question of whether Tennard was the primary

20

22

was a follower.

23

have even stabbed the victim in this case.

24

been his co-defendant who may be lying or -- or minimizing

25

their own responsibility in order to cover their tracks.

And so that's exactly how Tennard's counsel
He suggested that -- that Tennard

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And so that's the theory before the jury from counsel's

2

perspective, and that fits squarely within deliberateness

3

here.

4

QUESTION:

All right.

Could I -- can I -- can I

5

interrupt you there?

It seems to me that under the -­

6

let's take the first prong of the First Circuit's test,

7

the unique severity requirement, that in fact, if the

8

unique severity requirement is a proper reading of -- of

9

Penry, then it seems to me we've read that evidence, in

10

effect, right out of -- of relevance and admissibility.

11

There are millions of followers in this world.

12

way in the world, I would suppose, on this evidence that

13

-- that one could plausibly argue that this individual's

14

condition was a uniquely severe follower kind of

15

personality, and therefore it would be excluded.

16

seems to me that the unique severity requirement would

17

preclude the argument you just made in support of the -­

18

the court's position.

19

MR. MARSHALL:

20

question of admissibility, though.

21

the court was looking at on appeal -­

And -- and here what

No, but it -- it -- as your brother

23

on the other side said, if it's constitutional relevance,

24

it could be a basis for an admissibility ruling.

25

But let's, as you say, take the case that we've

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

got and -- and on the case that we've got, the -- in

2

effect, the Court is saying there's no need even to get to

3

the argument that counsel for the State of Texas has just

4

made because on -- on no reading of uniquely severe could

5

we say that this is uniquely severe evidence.

6

therefore, we don't even have to get to the question of

7

whether sufficient consideration could have been given to

8

this under -- under Penry.

9

MR. MARSHALL:

And

Your Honor, it's -- it's a

10

combination question that we're looking at here.

It's

11

whether the evidence had -- had mitigating significance

12

and then whether that significance was beyond the scope of

13

the special issues.

14

QUESTION:

I think that -­
But you say -- but as I understand

15

it, the circuit and the Court of Criminal Appeals says we

16

don't even have to deal with the substance of these issues

17

unless the evidence is indicative of something which is

18

uniquely severe, which clearly this is not.

19

the -- as I understand the circuit's position, there would

20

be no need for you to make the argument that you just made

21

to us about the adequacy of consideration that could be

22

given under -- under Penry because on the uniquely severe

23

test, we don't even -- it's not uniquely severe under any

24

reading and therefore we don't even have to get to the

25

question of substance.

It was

18

at issue in the companion case Smith, but here what we're

19

looking at in the denial of COA context under the AEDPA is

20

whether the State court's treatment of the issue was

21

reasonable or not.

And I think -­

22

QUESTION:

It's the same test, isn't it?

23

MR. MARSHALL:

Not quite, Your Honor.

The -­

24

the State court has taken a slightly different tack.

They

25

did not address the nexus, severity, uniquely severe test

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

when they addressed Tennard's evidence in this case in Ex

2

parte Tennard, as contained in the joint appendix.

3

did not apply that test.

4

They

And in the past, they have taken different

5

approaches over nexus, for example.

6

court has always held that nexus is established

7

automatically if a defendant introduces evidence of mental

8

retardation, and they have granted relief in numerous

9

cases on that very point, that there's several cases in my

10

brief at pages 27 and 28 that I've identified where the -­

11

I think there are six or seven -- where the State court

12

granted relief saying that we know mental retardation is

13

uniquely severe because not only, as it was described in

14

Penry, but -- but in earlier cases, that -- that it

15

affects the defendant's ability to control their impulses,

16

it affects their ability to learn from their mistakes.

17

These are the things that are mitigating and these have an

18

automatic nexus.

19

The -- the State

So there's a difference between the way the

20

Fifth Circuit has applied it and the way the State court

21

has applied it, and I don't -­

22

QUESTION:

But what is the State -- I thought

23

that at one point you told us that -- that the Fifth

24

Circuit got the severity and nexus threshold requirements

25

from the State, that the State initiated those

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

requirements.

2

distinguished from Smith, the State applied some other

3

test?

4

And now you say but in Tennard's case, as

MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, the State court

5

initially began by asking -- by identifying more or less

6

four factors, whether the -- whether the evidence was

7

involuntary disability, whether it was permanent in

8

nature, whether it was severe enough, and whether there

9

was at least an inference of nexus from the evidence.

10

Those four factors parallel, more or less, the uniquely

11

severe, permanent handicap language from Graham.

12

And so the two tests have gone in parallel

13

through the years, although the State court has vindicated

14

many more Penry claims than the Fifth Circuit has simply

15

because that's where the meritorious claims were found and

16

that's where they got relief.

17

never been faced with the number of cases that the State

18

court was that presented evidence that rose to that level

19

so that I think in retrospect, the Fifth Circuit's test

20

becomes a little bit severe when it is viewed in that

21

vacuum but when it's compared with the way the State court

22

has done it, basically all of the meritorious claims have

23

been vindicated.

25

QUESTION:

So the Fifth Circuit has

differently by the State court.

11

QUESTION:

I'm rather mixed up.

I mean, I'm

12

taking your brief on pages 10 through 12, and reading your

13

account of it, what I thought happened is that when the

14

defendant, who had been sentenced to death, went to the

15

district court and then to the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth

16

Circuit did not say, just as Justice Souter said -- it did

17

not say this evidence helps to show this person will not

18

commit the crime.

19

argument, this evidence shows he's more dangerous because

20

a mentally retarded person at this level might commit more

21

crimes.

22

Rather, they said, when faced with the

They didn't decide that issue.
And then reading from your brief, it said the

reason is because the evidence comes far from

demonstrating that Smith suffered from a, quote, uniquely

severe, permanent handicap.

And that the

MR. MARSHALL:

Justice Breyer, the -- the

12

fact that he had an antisocial personality disorder, all

13

of these other factors.

it was given.

QUESTION:

When you say no idea what kind of a

test, it was recognized it was an IQ test, wasn't it?
MR. MARSHALL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It

23

was recognized as an IQ test.

And -- I -- my point was

24

that it wasn't identified as a short-form test, a full­

25

scale IQ score.

QUESTION:

Isn't that something the State would

know if it were given in a State prison?

3

were given at a certain period of time in a State prison,

4

that's -- that's something that the State could easily

5

find out what were they giving at the time.

MR. MARSHALL:

If the tests

Your Honor, it was not contained

7

on the -- the social and criminal history form that was

8

introduce, and that's at page 63 of the joint appendix.

9

It -- it's -- it's not in that form.

And the parole

10

officer who was called as a witness by the defense who

11

brought this form didn't know the answer to that question

12

either.

13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

But somebody connected with the State

correction system would know, would they not?
MR. MARSHALL:

Presumably someone would know.

The psychologist who administered the test would know.
QUESTION:

Well, the State could have informed

18

itself fully of what goes on at State prisons with regard

19

to IQ tests.

20

MR. MARSHALL:

That's possible, Your Honor,

21

except that it was the defendant's evidence in this case.

22

And I don't think that the State necessarily looked at it

23

as any significant evidence, just like I don't think the

24

defense looked at it as significant evidence.

25

QUESTION:

But all of this goes to the weight

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the evidence might have, but it -- what -- what does

2

it have to do with whether it is appropriate to erect this

3

threshold test for considering whether it even needs to be

4

considered as -- as an issue on appeal?

5

MR. MARSHALL:

Justice Souter, under -- under

6

both Graham and Johnson, we're trying to figure out

7

whether the evidence had some relevance within the special

8

issues, not whether it had every bit of relevance it

9

should have had, but whether it just had some meaningful

10

relevance.

And so I think looking at the weight of the

11

evidence is part of that analysis.

12

see what the jury would have -- what meaning the jury

13

would have given -­

14

QUESTION:

We have to look and

No, but it -- it -- you -- you don't

15

-- I take it your argument is not that they couldn't give

16

it any weight at all.

17

MR. MARSHALL:

18

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

So the -- the -- what I'm going to

19

call the screening question we have before us is does a

20

Court even have to get into the use that might be made of

21

that evidence, whatever its weight, unless that evidence

22

satisfies these two threshold requirements -­

23

MR. MARSHALL:

24

QUESTION:

25

Your Honor, those threshold -­

-- or the State's equivalent of the

two threshold requirements?

Isn't that the issue before

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

us?
MR. MARSHALL:

I believe that is the issue, and

3

I might add that those threshold requirements are

4

questions as to what relevance the evidence had and how it

5

could have fit within the special issues.

6

looking at severity and nexus, we're looking at how does

7

the evidence mitigate moral culpability, how does it tend

8

to excuse the crime.

9

QUESTION:

So when we're

But the -- the circuit, I take it,

10

would say, all right, given the fact that there may be an

11

argument over the weight to be given, accepting that, we

12

don't have to decide whether enough weight could be given

13

to that evidence for Penry purposes unless that evidence

14

indicates something that is uniquely severe and was the

15

cause of the crime.

16

MR. MARSHALL:

Generally speaking, Justice

17

Souter, the evidence that fails to pass that test does

18

have some relevance within the special issues because,

19

generally speaking, it tends to either show that the crime

20

was an aberration -- what we're looking for is something

21

that's -- when we're trying to identify Penry error, we're

22

looking at evidence that's solely aggravating in answering

23

those special issues, not necessarily evidence that just

24

has some relevance outside those special issues, just

25

whether it has only aggravating relevance within them or

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

no relevance within them.
And I think that's what the Court was talking

3

about in Graham and Johnson, where we looked at youth and

4

-- and determined that, yes, youth had -- may have some

5

significance outside future dangerousness, but the fact

6

that it has some significance within future dangerousness

7

cures any potential Penry error.

8

these factors that the Fifth Circuit has identified, and

9

the State court to a lesser extent, are designed to root

And that's exactly what

10

out, to try to catch those types of evidence and determine

11

whether they indeed had some relevance or not.

12

QUESTION:

Can I --

13

QUESTION:

You're saying --

14

QUESTION:

-- procedurally I -- I see what -­

15

what we have in -- in your case is it's -- there's a

16

reference to lower court in your brief, and I'm not sure

17

which it is.

18

Fifth Circuit had been fairly been clear that their two

controversial matters determined this.

20

and I'm trying to get the procedural part right -- is they

didn't say anything.

8

this case doesn't really present the issue that we took it

to deal with.

MR. MARSHALL:

11

-- the Fifth Circuit looked at the State court

adjudication -­

13

QUESTION:

This case

Now, what do you suggest we do?

I

14

mean, suppose I happened to think that -- that the Texas

15

Fifth Circuit is applying two tests that are really

16

erroneous and not a correct interpretation?

17

thought that was a big issue and maybe that was so, have

18

you any suggestion as to how we should proceed?

19

MR. MARSHALL:

If I -- if I

Well, Your Honor, contrary -- I

20

mean, and in contrast to Penry and the prior cases that

21

came before the Court, this is not here on de novo review.

22

We're now bound by the AEDPA, and we're looking at

23

reasonableness.

24

looking at it from a different angle now, and -- and so

25

whether the Court simply disagrees with the test is not an

And so I think the Court is necessarily

QUESTION:

What about saying we've seen in other

3

cases like Smith, for example, that the Fifth Circuit has

4

continuously denied review or reversed or affirmed or

5

whatever on the basis of these two tests?

6

it's a reasonable assumption that that played a role in

7

their decision here too, particularly since whether this

8

case does fit within Graham and -- and the other one you

9

cited, is certainly open to reasonable argument.

10
11

And so we think

Now,

what would be wrong with taking that approach?
MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, I think that again,

12

if the Court disagrees with the test that was applied in

the Fifth Circuit, the Court is still stuck with -- with

determining whether it was the State court's opinion that

was reasonable or not.

that this is the case for it, and -­

QUESTION:

So we're even one step further
I don't think

Could -- could I get back to what you

had just said before Justice Breyer asked you the

is that these two tests do, indeed, bear upon the Penry

determination.

can be -- it can be -- it can cut both ways.

MR. MARSHALL:

What about the -- the nexus requirement?

MR. MARSHALL:

How does that

We're -- in trying to -- in

20

trying to analyze the -- the Penry claim, we're trying to

21

figure out whether -- whether the evidence introduced at

22

trial had -- had significant relevance to moral

23

culpability that was outside the scope of the special

24

issues.

25

factors, not necessarily each one, one by one, that gets

And I think it's the combination of those

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you there, but the nexus requirement basically just asks

2

the question whether it actually has relevance to moral

3

culpability and whether that relevance reaches the level

4

that it placed it outside the special issues.

5

QUESTION:

All right.

With respect to the

6

first, I can understand why it bears upon the Penry thing.

7

With respect to the second, it seems sensible, but I don't

8

-- I don't see how it has any bearing on the -- on -- on

9

whether you can give that -- that factor some effect under

10
11

the special issues.
MR. MARSHALL:

Well, for example, Justice

12

Scalia, I -- I think that the evidence of follower status,

13

for example, that -- that was argued extensively to the

14

jury in this case would have a nexus to the crime because,

15

of course, it involved the circumstances of the crime.

16

And so, therefore, it would fall within the special issue

17

of deliberateness where the jury is asked to resolve the

18

issue of -- of the specific intent required in a party

19

situation like this.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but I mean it -- it accidentally

21

had a nexus to the crime because, you know, he claimed

22

that he was a follower in this crime.

23

introduced the same evidence?

24

other situations he's a follower, but there's no direct

25

evidence that in this crime -- in this crime he was.

What if he

MR. MARSHALL:

QUESTION:

Well, then I think -­

Why do you need the nexus in order to

3

make it considerable by the jury?

4

MR. MARSHALL:

Well, then I would question

5

whether the evidence actually had relevance to moral

6

culpability if it had no connection to the defendant or

7

his crime.

8

looking at here, is -- is -- and again, it's part of the

9

-- the multi-part test that the Fifth Circuit and the

10

And so I think that's the inquiry we're

11

And I think the best explanation occurs in -- in

13

was handed down last year.

that he'll be dangerous in the future?

The nexus requirement -- does that

MR. MARSHALL:

It -- it requires a nexus, at

22

least an inferential nexus, to the crime itself, Your

Honor.

24

that would not be -- not satisfy the nexus requirement.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. OWEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Owen, is your understanding the

6

same as Mr. Marshall's that we're talking about a universe

7

of 100 cases?

8
9

MR. OWEN:

I -- I tried to count them myself,

Your Honor, and my number was closer to 50.

And I don't

10

know on what -- I don't know where or how we disagree, but

11

I think the universe of cases is -- is obviously more than

12

perhaps 40 and -- and I guess by his count fewer than 100.

13

Again, it's only the people who were sentenced -- and

14

again, I think we need to emphasize that a ruling in favor

15

of Mr. Tennard would only affect the sentences of people

16

who introduced mitigating evidence at their trial that had

17

relevance to moral culpability outside the inquiries that

18

the jury received in its instructions.

19

would be a subset beyond the number of cases just tried

20

prior to 1991 that would include the cases in which

21

certain kinds of mitigating evidence like the 67 IQ in

22

this case were introduced.

So, again, there

23

Let me address Justice Breyer's question first

24

about the Fifth Circuit's treatment of the claim in this

25

case.

Justice Breyer, I'd like to refer you to pages 20

to 22 of our brief, and at those pages we described the

2

way in which the Fifth Circuit analyzed the claim in our

3

case.

4

applied both the unique severity test and the nexus test

5

and found us wanting on both scores.

6

in the way that the Fifth Circuit has, having reached the

7

merits, it said that we didn't get a COA.

8

not sure.

9

apply the test, and so I don't think there would be

And I think it is -- it is the case that they

And then ultimately,

So I'm -- I'm

I think -- but that -- they did -- they did

10

anything inappropriate about this Court assessing the

11

appropriateness of the test.

12

With respect to the trial record, I do want to

13

emphasize that the word follower does not appear in

14

defense counsel's closing argument.

15

not make the argument that Mr. Tennard was a follower,

16

that his 67 IQ made him a follower, that he followed other

17

people in committing this crime.

18

comment from defense counsel, a single sentence in the

19

course of the closing argument which says with respect to

20

an earlier crime that Mr. Tennard was involved in, that he

21

was not the leader.

22

culpable than anybody else.

23

involved in that crime because he was following somebody

24

else.

the theory that Mr. Tennard, because of his 67 IQ, is a

2

follower.

3

theory that having a 67 IQ is the sort of globally

4

disabling quality that affects everything Mr. Tennard

5

does, every action that he takes, every thought that he

6

has, every judgment that he makes.

It is a case that was defended at trial on the

7

QUESTION:

Was that argument made?

8

MR. OWEN:

It is certainly argued, Your Honor,

9

that -- as defense counsel puts it to the jury, he says,

10

you have a man who has an IQ that is that low, and he says

11

to the jury, none of you know what it's like to have a 67

12

IQ.

13

And I think -- and the -- and the prosecutor,

14

for his part, doesn't dispute the lowness of the IQ score.

15

The prosecutor's argument isn't, oh, come now, a 67 IQ

16

isn't that low.

17

instructions, ladies and gentlemen, you're not asked why

18

Mr. Tennard became a danger.

19

he's a danger.

20

jury was asked to consider.

21
22

The prosecutor's argument is, under these

You're being asked whether

That's the only thing that the -- that the

I think that -- that it's important to keep in
mind the quality of this mitigating evidence.

23

It also was suggested that counsel didn't object

24

to the instructions, didn't ask for a special instruction.

25

While he did not ask for a special instruction at the

1

point of the jury charge, there is a pretrial motion filed

2

by defense counsel which complains that the Texas statute

3

does not permit the consideration of mitigating

4

circumstances, which asked for definitions of the key

5

terms in the statute, and that was denied.

6

it's certainly not a case in which there was -- it was -­

7

you know, the people at trial were unaware of this problem

8

with the instructions.

9

counsel's argument.

So it's -­

That's evident from defense

10

I think that the -- the one -- one thing I want

11

to emphasize about the nature of this mitigating evidence

12

is the way in which it's -- it's -- it does affect moral

13

culpability.

14

on this actually is from a concurring opinion in Skipper

15

where, in the course of explaining why they felt that

16

evidence of good behavior in jail didn't qualify as Eighth

17

Amendment mitigating evidence, Justice Powell joined,

18

among others, by Chief Justice Rehnquist, said, evidence

19

of a reduced capacity for considered choice bears directly

20

on the fundamental justice of imposing capital punishment.

21

This evidence in our case is evidence of that kind of

22

reduced capacity that the jury had no vehicle for giving

23

that kind of mitigating effect to in imposing sentence.
