ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The issue in these consolidated cases is whether

11

participants and beneficiaries of ERISA plans may seek

12

consequential and punitive damages in state court under state

13

tort law for the allegedly wrongful denial of ERISA health care

14

benefits.

15

reasoning that completely -- that the complete preemption under

16

the Federal statute applies to contract claims that essentially

17

duplicate what's available under Section 502 of the Federal

18

statute, but not to tort claims, which give supplemental remedy

19

for consequential and punitive damages.

20

The Fifth Circuit answered that question yes,

For two principal reasons, the judgment of the Fifth

21

Circuit should be reversed.

First, this Court has consistently

22

held that all challenges to the propriety of benefit

23

determination, whether couched in tort or in contract, are

24

completely preempted by Section 502 and therefore are removable

25

and governed solely by Federal law.

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Second, the fact that the welfare plans at issue in

2

these cases provide benefits for medical care, as opposed to

3

disability, death, or some other welfare benefit, does not alter

4

the analysis under the Federal statute or give the states any

5

more power to supplement the remedies that Congress included in

6

Section 502.

7

QUESTION:

Now just to be clear, Mr. Estrada, you take

8

the position that ERISA Section 502(a) completely preempts the

9

Texas scheme here?

10

MR. ESTRADA:

11

QUESTION:

12

preemption under Section 514?

13
14

And we don't have before us any conflict

MR. ESTRADA:
O'Connor.

That is - that is right, Justice

That is our position.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ESTRADA:

17

Yes.

Okay.
And turning to Section 502(a) and to the

--

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question?

19

I'm sure you'll cover it in the argument and I want to get it on

20

the table.

21

that 502 is the exclusive remedy for actions to acquire benefits,

22

is there a distinction?

23

denials based on the terms of the plan, that this just doesn't

24

qualify for some reason, on the one hand, that you just should

25

get the answer out of the plan, and denials based on a

On your first point, that our prior cases have said

discretionary decision as to whether the medical treatment was

2

appropriate or not, which would require the exercise of some kind

3

of professional judgment.

4

an extra day in the hospital or something like that.

5

valid distinction or not?

6

MR. ESTRADA:

The nurse might think he doesn't need

No.

Is that a

And let me turn to that -- that was

7

my second point, but I'll turn to it now.

The use of medical

8

criteria, whether discretionary or not, is inherent in health

9

care coverage and usually is also inherent in - - in disability

10

coverage.

11

held that the -- that a claimant's treating doctor gets no

12

special deference in a claim for the benefits where the issue is

13

whether the medical factors warrant a disability finding.

14

the theory being advanced by Texas and the respondents in this

15

case, however, Black & Decker needn't, and maybe even couldn't,

16

be an ERISA case because a state of the union could regulate the

17

medical component of the disability finding under the guise of

18

regulating the practice of medicine and could give tort remedies

19

and consequential and punitive damages whenever the plan

20

disagreed with the -- with the claimant's doctor.

21

Yet, last Term, in the Black & Decker case, this Court

QUESTION:

Under

Yes, of course they could, but the fact that

22

if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean

23

they would win on the merits.

24

formulary may be absolutely defensible, even though it could be

25

tested in a state court proceeding.

I mean, you are -- your drug

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I didn't understand the claim as to

2

the Aetna case necessarily to be a challenge to the promulgation

3

of the formulary, which is expressly authorized by the

4

prescription drug writer of the plan.

5

to be to a particular benefits decision that was made when Aetna,

6

as the insurer and plan administrator, concluded that the benefit

7

was not covered in the circumstances because of the step therapy

8

requirement.

9

QUESTION:

I understood the challenge

I don't want you to go too long on point two

10

without getting back to point one, but as long as we're here, it

11

does seem to me that the dichotomy, the duality you propose

12

between a decision about benefits and medical treatment might, at

13

the edges, blur into each other.

14

you're not authorized to seek this treatment and the person has

15

no other funds, basically, that is a treatment decision, in a

16

sense.

17

MR. ESTRADA:

If I say, as Aetna or CIGNA,

No, it is not, Justice Kennedy.

The

18

purpose of employee benefits plan -- benefit plans is to cover

19

some things for the employees.

20

that the benefit was $100 for each hospital stay or that you got

21

$20 for your drugs, whatever they may be, no one would deny that

22

that was a -- that that was a benefit determination.

23

earlier, with respect to medical care, it has always been the

24

case that in determining the scope of coverage, medical factors

25

have always been used and that factor is imbedded into the

If the plans in these cases said

2

background understandings of how this very statute works.
For example, Section 503 of the statute allows the

3

Department of Labor to promulgate regulations to deal with how

4

claims are made and the like.

5

the Department of Labor expressly contemplates that if a claimant

6

has a proposed treatment turned down, he may appeal to a named

7

fiduciary who is required, under the DOL regs, to consult with an

8

-- with an appropriate medical hair -- care professional and -­

9

QUESTION:

One of those regulations by -- by

I guess my point was, at some time, and even

10

in these cases, there -- that there was a component of what we

11

might call medical judgment involved.

12

MR. ESTRADA:

That is undisputed, Justice Kennedy, and

13

I think that our position is that there is a fundamental

14

difference between a claimant who has a doctor patient

15

relationship with his doctor and a claimant who has an insuretal

16

coverage relation with his insurer.

17

of legal practice, if the person reading the plan documents and

18

denying a claim -- the claim, excuse me, uses medical training to

19

conclude that the plan documents did not cover a treatment, I

20

think few people would think that that entitled the claimant to

21

sue the person who turned it down for legal malpractice.

22

Just to put it into context

And the same is basically true here, too, because the

23

plan's -- the plan's role, as is very clearly expressed, for

24

example, in the -- in the text of the Monitronics plan, is to

25

deal with the question, shall we pay or shall we not pay.

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And

1

that's actually precisely what Texas has targeted here.

2

If I could direct the Court's attention to the petition

3

appendix in the Aetna case, 02-1885, the relevant parts of the

4

Texas statute are set forth in page 59a and -­

It is an affirmative defense under the Texas

Once again, this is targeting the coverage

aspect, not the treatment.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but let me just focus on the case

3

involving the woman who may have needed a second day in the

4

hospital.

5

discretion to grant that second day if the nurse thought it was

6

really medically required?

7

Is it correct that they -- an agent of the HMO had

MR. ESTRADA:

I don't -- I don't know if there's

8

anything in the record about that.

What is clear from the record

9

and from Federal law, Justice Stevens, is that somebody in the

10

plan would have discretion to hear her appeal, even if the nurse

11

that -- that turned the request down -­

12

QUESTION:

So the decision as to whether she would have

13

the second day in the hospital would depend on a medical judgment

14

made by an agent of the plan.

15

MR. ESTRADA:

Is that correct?

It would -- it would ultimately -- it

16

would ultimately turn on -- on a coverage decision that may

17

include medical criteria.

18

QUESTION:

But the coverage is if it's medically

19

needed, it would -- she would get the second day.

20

not it's covered then turns on a medical judgment, does it not?

MR. ESTRADA:

But whether or

But the question of medical necessity is

It is not a medical term, Justice Stevens, and

QUESTION:

Yes, but is not correct, to make the

coverage decision, one has to make a medical decision?

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ESTRADA:

It -- one has to make -- one part of the

2

coverage decision is the medical decision.

3

for example, the plan sets forth a definition of medical

4

necessity which -- which sets forth, I do point out, is that you

5

have to need it -- to need the care -­

6

QUESTION:

In the Aetna case,

Well, I was focusing on the CIGNA case,

7

because it seemed to me that it's a little clearer there that

8

there would be a medical judgment required.

9

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, once again, Justice Stevens, we do

10

not contend that health insurance does not involve the

11

consideration of medical factors.

12

inherent in the nature of the product that it would, just as I

13

never had car insurance before I actually owned a car.

14

QUESTION:

And, as I said, it is almost

But it's a little -- it's a little like -­

15

if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the

16

plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of

17

medical care, in a way.

18

MR. ESTRADA:

That is not right, Justice O'Connor, for

19

the following reason.

The plan documents here, and the

20

background understanding of all of the parties, is that it is for

21

the treating doctor to chart the course of treatment for the

22

patient and, in fact, under the AMA's old code of ethics, which

23

we cite on page 6 of the Aetna reply brief, a physician is not

24

allowed to sway his judgment as to treatment by the existence or

25

non-existence of coverage.

In many cases, unfortunately, there

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

will be people who have no coverage or no insurance, or may be

2

under-insured.

3

But just to bring back the case to what the statute is

4

about, this statue is about encouraging employers to make hard

5

choices to give coverage to employees to the extent they can.

6

There is no requirement in Federal law that requires employers to

7

give -- there are very few requirements in Federal law that

8

require employers to give particular benefits if they choose to

9

have a plan.

And, as this Court has said, most recently in the

10

Rush case, this is about a bargain with employers that seeks to

11

encourage the formation of these plans and the provision of

12

benefits to the extent possible by assuring employers of limited

13

liabilities under predictable standards.

14

QUESTION: If you are correct that Section 502(a)

15

preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the

16

plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and

17

suffering or things like that?

18

MR. ESTRADA:

I would think not, Justice O'Connor.

Our

19

amicus, the Department of Labor, may take a slightly different

20

view of that.

21

case, which seemed very clearly, to us, at least, to stand for

22

the proposition that equitable is to be determined by reference

23

to a historical examination of all that is available in equity -­

24
25

Our reading of the Mertens case and the Great West

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you make an analogy to a trustee

in equity, I think this is a different case than Mertens or Great

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

West, because here, the Aetna and CIGNA are fiduciaries, are they

2

not?

3
4

MR. ESTRADA:

Aetna is -- and CIGNA is for purposes of

claims processing.

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

And so, as a fiduciary they're -- they

6

are analogous to a trustee, at least, the government said, if I

7

read their footnote 13 right, that back in the old days when

8

there were -- was a division of the bench, that one of the

9

remedies available against a trustee would be in the nature of

10

make whole relief that would put the beneficiary in the position

11

he would have been in if the trustee had not committed the breach

12

of trust.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

That was the view to which I referred to

14

earlier, Justice Ginsberg, and it is possible that it may be

15

right.

16

would be a tough case to make, but it is not the issue in this

17

case.

18

It seems to me, based on Great West and Mertens, that it

Now -­
QUESTION:

No, but the whole thing would work if we

19

could do that, wouldn't it?

I mean, if we could get Mertens

20

consistent with what Justice Ginsberg just read, then you would

21

provide people who are hurt, in the way these plaintiffs were

22

hurt, with a remedy.

It wouldn't be punitive damages, but they

23

would be made whole.

So, if you are right in that this is

24

basically a -- this is basically a claims decision and you

25

shouldn't give punitives and others for the incorrect making of a

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

claims decision.

2

gets nothing or virtually nothing and, if we could reconsider

3

that part, it would all work, wouldn't it?

4

But the hole in this is that then the woman

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it might, but it also works in the

5

way it currently is for the following reason.

The interaction of

6

the structure of Section 502 and Section 503 is intended to set

7

forth a mechanism, under the DOL regs under Section 503, to

8

encourage the expedis -- the expeditious resolution of claims

9

disagreements.

And this is -- the statute contemplates

10

litigation but is not about litigation.

11

the benefit when it is needed and not about waiting until it no

12

longer helps you, having bypassed all avenues you had at the

13

time, external review, plan appeals, or maybe an action for an

14

injunction and then suing for relief, make whole or otherwise.

15
16

This is all about giving

If I could, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve

Ginsberg said, our position, I think, is in footnote 13 of our

2

brief, and it's a position the Department of Labor has taken in

cases and number -­

4

QUESTION: Pretty big point to be in a footnote.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, it's -- it really isn't the issue

6

in this case because our position in this case is that the claims

7

are preempted by 502(a)(1)(B).

8

fiduciary involved, in the days of the divided bench, when a

9

beneficiary sued a fiduciary, they weren't -- they could -- were

10

able to get make whole relief.

11

QUESTION:

But, in a case where there was a

And the -- by the same -­

Lest we be too sanguine about the

12

application of that law in this context, I don't know any

13

equitable cases that would consider make whole relief to be

14

giving -- where what is at issue is merely the payment -- the

15

failure to pay money, refusal to pay money.

16

would give you what you would have done with that money if you

17

had gotten it.

18

Make whole relief

That's very strange.

MR. FELDMAN:

You get -- there were -- there are cases

19

that I -- I don't want to get too deeply into 502(a)(3)(B),

20

because I don't think it's what's at issue in this case.

21

there are cases in which, for example, a trustee doesn't buy an

22

insurance policy that they're supposed to buy and then the

23

beneficiary can get, as a relief, whatever the value of that

24

insurance policy would have been and -­

25

QUESTION:

Sure.

But

But all that's going on here is that

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the claimant was perfectly able to buy Vioxx with his own money,

2

but when it was said by the insurer that they wouldn't pay for

3

Vioxx, the claimant went and -- went with the drug that was

4

covered.

5

the fact that even if we deny relief here it'll all be okay

6

because under traditional equity law, in a situation like that,

7

you can -- you can get whatever you would have done had you been

8

given the money.

9

I have serious doubts whether we can take comfort in

I don't know that that principle washes.

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, 502(a)(3) -- I mean, ERISA does set

10

up a beneficiary trustee -- a beneficiary fiduciary type of

11

relationship that does have analogies in traditional equity.

12

in any event -­

13

QUESTION:

But

And the government has taken position -­

14

this is -- the footnote was not the easiest to read, but I take

15

it the Department of Labor has taken the position, in some ERISA

16

cases, that there would be just the kind of relief that Justice

17

Scalia mentioned.

18

Would this case fit that pattern?

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- it's not clear to me whether it

19

would, because it's not clear to me whether there was a fiduciary

20

involved in this case.

21

neither they -- the people who denied the benefits on behalf of

22

the plans may or may not have been fiduciaries.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Neither of the claimants in this case,

But, as Mr. Estrada just told us that, for

these purposes, both Aetna and CIGNA would be fiduciaries.
MR. FELDMAN:

They -- well, whether the -- you know, I

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

frankly haven't thought about whether the plan itself would be a

fiduciary.

I would like to hear your arguments on the

preemption issue.
MR. FELDMAN:

Thank you.

Our argument is that the

12

Texas law provides an additional remedy to that in Section

13

502(a)(1)(B), because respondents' right to recover compensatory

14

and punitive damages in this case depends on their showing that

15

they had a right to the benefits under the plan -- under the

16

terms of their plan.

17

prove that the plan's failure to exercise what the state law says

18

is due care, that their failure to exercise due care is the

19

proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.

20

that could be true is if the plan didn't pay benefits that it was

21

obligated to pay under the terms of the plan.

QUESTION:

The state law provides that plaintiffs must

These claims can be made orally, again,

if the exigencies require, and she could -- she didn't try -- as

the results of that would have been.

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

But then -­

Why are you preempting the state providing a

MR. FELDMAN:

That would have been itself a denial of

QUESTION:

But let me say there's also -­

It would have been a denial, but it wouldn't

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but there are other backstops for

her getting the extra day in the hospital.

She is, at that

11

point, in the same position as anyone else who can't pay for

12

another day in the hospital but they need it.

I understand.

MR. FELDMAN: It's up to her doctor, with whom she has a

QUESTION:

But the question we really are facing is

21

whether the State of Texas is denied the authority to provide a

MR. FELDMAN:

Yeah, but the State of Texas has many

24

remedies to make sure the hospitals don't discharge people who

25

need an extra day in the hospital and medical ethics provides

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. YOUNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

I want to focus on the narrow Federal jurisdictional

11

issue because this case -- these two cases come to the Court

12

based on the Federal removal doctrine that goes under the rubric

13

of complete preemption.

14

complete preemption, the plaintiff's cause of action, while not

15

citing to the Federal statute, almost exactly duplicated the

16

Federal remedy.

In each of this Court's cases on

Here we don't have that.

17

Here, what Texas has done is to fill a vacuum and say

we are going to set out a professional medical standard of care

20

position, they would be free to say we're going to use the

21

medical necessity standard of a witch doctor or whatever we

22

decide it is on today's basis without any reference to objective

23

medical standards.

24

doesn't say that, but under their argument today, they would be

25

free to do that.

Under the HMO's

point of whether they're Scott free to do whatever they want.

They surely aren't, you know.

14

relief provided by 502(a).

MR. YOUNG:

But, Justice Scalia, in these two cases,

those were bad medical decisions, there is no remedy.

you want to have Vioxx, buy it yourself, and I gather there was

23

some co-payment that would have been given, and if their doctor

24

thought that Vioxx was really essential, surely the doctor would

25

have abided, you know, pony up the money.

But to say that the plan condemned them to

here is money.

additional money for the Vioxx.

MR. YOUNG:

All you're talking about

The claimant didn't want to lay out the

Well, the truth is, Your Honor, that

7

neither of these claimants would have needed health insurance if

8

they had the independent means to just whip out a gold card and

9

pay for the drug.

10

QUESTION:

See, that's why I'm thinking that Vioxx is

11

not that -- you know, on your argument you were just making, and

12

I'll only lead you into this red herring once.

13

MR. YOUNG:

14

QUESTION:

Okay.
But it would all work, you see, if I have a

15

trust, the trust is supposed to buy me an insurance policy, and

16

through total fault of the trust it doesn't, and the house burns

17

down, that equitable relief appropriate would be consequential

18

damages of the value of the house.

19

appropriate case, other equitable relief, this whole thing would

20

work and you wouldn't be having to fill a vacuum.

21

MR. YOUNG:

Now, if that were an

But under this Court's opinions previously

22

under 502, that remedy and those kinds of relief are not

23

available.

24
25

QUESTION: So you see then the logical point where I'm ­
- I'd like to say modify those perhaps, but, well, the very fact

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that you're trying to fill this hole here proves the point,

2

because if there is a hole, it's because the court has

3

interpreted this statute perhaps wrongly as the Federal relief

4

being A, B, and C.

5

what the state's trying to do here, is add D.

6

they can't do, is add D to A, B, and C.

7

Maybe it should be A, B, C, and D, and so
And the one thing

MR. YOUNG: It's true, Your Honor, that there is this

8

hole, but that is not the reason that we should prevail on this

9

narrow jurisdictional issue, because it's the source of the duty.

10

The duty that arises here is not based on what is in the plan

11

document on medical necessity.

12

that is imposed by Texas statute to meet the professional medical

13

standard of care.

14

It comes from the external duty

QUESTION: Well, how different is the question of the

15

merits here, whether you should prevail and the question of

16

complete preemption which is raised in the removal issue?

17

MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice they are different.

18

Because, in this narrow issue, the complete preemption issue,

19

especially when one looks at Pilot Life and Taylor.

20

decisions relied very heavily on section 301 cases, the Labor

21

Management Relations Act cases. But if you look at those cases

22

since Pilot Life and Taylor, every time the duty arose from

23

something separate than the collective bargaining agreement,

24

every time this Court has said that there is no complete

25

preemption.

QUESTION: So your view is you could prevail on the

2

propriety of removal, because there's not complete preemption,

3

and yet go back and lose on the issue of whether your claim is in

4

fact preempted?

5

MR. YOUNG: Yes Your Honor, that is the way complete

6

versus conflict preemption can work and the way that the fifth

7

circuit said it could work.

8

think that we lose on Section 515 preemption either.

9

every time this Court has gone through an ERISA analysis and

Because by shifting -­

QUESTION: It's important to the patient to know.

13

Because the patient when -- when the patient finds out that if

14

you take Vioxx, you'll have to pay for it yourself, the patient

15

can then ask the doctor, look doc, is it really important that I

16

take Vioxx or is this other stuff in your judgment as the

17

treating physician, is this other stuff good or not -- good

18

enough.

19

It seems to me you want that decision to be made early.

MR. YOUNG: Well, the truth is that making the decision here

shifts the risk.

MR. YOUNG: It's not just that they could deny it, they

deselected from the network, they could be told you're not going

you might.

2

QUESTION: Yes.

3

MR. YOUNG: Then could we talk about Taylor a little

4

more, because that's really the complete branch -­

5

(Laughing)

6

MR. YOUNG: I guess I come back to the Chief Justice's

7

point which is we could have a situation where Pilot Life

8

preemption could occur, but the Taylor holding is the one we're

9

most concerned about, and here we are not trying to duplicate a

10

claim that would be made under ERISA, under an ERISA duty.

11

And that leads me back to something else that's come

12

up.

The ERISA and it's regulations say nothing about setting a

13

medical standard of care, when these medical judgments are made.

14

That's an indication that it was left to the states, and should

15

be left to the states.

16

well this may still be preempted, but it shouldn't be removed to

17

Federal court, under complete preemption doctrines.

18

But this Court could certainly indicate,

QUESTION: Well how would that advance the general law

19

at all?

20

I don't think we took this case to decide some question of

21

removal jurisdiction, but I -- perhaps my colleagues don't agree

22

with me.

23

I mean, if the merits are decided against you, you know,

MR. YOUNG: Well, that is the very narrow issue that in fact

24

certiorari was granted on.

And it is an issue that this Court

25

last ruled on in the Anderson case last Term, and that case is

illustrative of why complete preemption shouldn't apply here.

2

There the majority found that the claim, while not citing to

Federal usury law duplicated precisely and exactly Federal usury

And it was in essence, a Federal usury claim.

Here our

It couldn't be, there's no claim

But more importantly we are not relying

QUESTION: It's a claim that depends on a denial of
benefits, and isn't that the touchstone under Pilot?
MR. YOUNG: In fact Your Honor, you could have a situation

11

where the medical necessity decision is made prospectively or

12

concurrently and that's not a payment denial, in fact that's what

13

we have in most circumstances of these kinds of cases.

14
15
16

QUESTION: But it is the predicate for a payment denial,
or a payment granted.
MR. YOUNG: Really Your Honor, in truth these decisions are

17

never expressed by the utilization nurse at the hospital as a

18

payment issue.

19

She says you've got to go home now.

QUESTION: Well let's go back to my question -- I didn't

20

mean to go off on a tangent.

21

22

payment of benefits?

QUESTION: You've described it very clearly.

10

12

That's why it's preempted.

MR. YOUNG: Well -- Your Honor, except we're confusing
remedies, and duties.

The Texas duty is found no where in ERISA.

QUESTION: May I ask this question.

Could you ever

13

recover under the Texas statute without proving that you were

14

entitled to have the benefit paid?

15

MR. YOUNG: It would not -­

16

QUESTION: It wouldn't be phrased in those terms.

17

Wouldn't it be part of -- wouldn't it be a necessary element of

18

your claim, that part of what you're -- that you did have an

19

entitlement to have that benefit paid.

20

MR. YOUNG: It would be an undisputed fact.

It would be

21

for example in these two cases.

It's undisputed that Ruby Calad

22

could get unlimited days in the hospital.

The only issue is the

23

medical judgment that she had to go home.

Same with Mr. Davila.

24

The medical judgment was that he would not get the Vioxx; he

25

would get the cheaper generic drug.

me you have to be able to prove that they had a duty to pay for ­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. MATTAX

8

FOR TEXAS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE

9

MR. MATTAX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10

Court.

11

on managed care entities that insert themselves into health care

12

treatment decisions by exercising medical judgment to decide

13

medical necessity.

14

this court recognized the managed care entity is not the ERISA

15

plan.

16

The Texas legislature has imposed a duty of ordinary care

It is important to recognize at the outset as

Our statute does not impose liability on the ERISA

17

plan.

Our statute does not impose liability on an employer.

As

18

Mr. Estrada said in his argument, the whole point of the complete

19

preemption and the exclusive remedies provision Section 502(a),

20

is insuring employers that will have limited liabilities.

21

statute explicitly excludes employers from liability.

22

therefore the concerns of Section 502(a) are not at play in the

23

Texas statute.

24

because managed care entities, HMOs and other varieties and

25

forms, had decided to exercise medical judgment.

Our

And

The reason the Texas statute was passed was

2

distinguishes this case from Pilot Life.

3

-­

4
5

Which is what I think
Going back and looking

QUESTION: How does it distinguish it from Pilot Life? I
mean Pilot Life is talking about the insurance part, wasn't it.

6

MR. MATTAX: Yes, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION: And then they said that even though

8

apparently on it's face had to do with insurance and you'd think

9

it would have been taken out, it wasn't taken out because of the

10
11
12
13
14

fact that it interfered with the basic purposes of the act.
MR. MATTAX: Pilot Life was based on the Court's
complete preemption decision in Allis-Chalmers versus Lueck.
QUESTION: Uh-huh.
MR. MATTAX: And in that case the Court recognized that the

15

tort claim that was being alleged was derived from the general

16

proposition to perform contracts in good faith.

17

that the Court was looking at in Allis-Chalmers, and also Pilot

18

Life, was the duty to enforce the contract that was the ERISA

19

plan therefore implicating complete preemption.

20

Court explicitly said in Allis-Chalmers, that Congress did not

21

intend to give substantive provisions the force of Federal law,

22

ousting any inconsistent state regulations, because such a rule

23

would allow labor unions, and unionized employees the power to

24

exempt themselves from whatever state labor standards they

25

disfavored.

And the duty

However the

And again the Texas statute is not imposing any duty

on the plan.

2

QUESTION: Yes, but is it not true that in order to

3

recover under the Texas statute, not only do you have to prove a

4

violation of the duty to use the due care and so forth.

5

also have to prove a violation of the plan?

6

MR. MATTAX: No I disagree.

But you

The revision in the act is

7

setup such that if a managed care entity were to come in and say

8

well I did not exercise any medical judgment, or I did not make

9

any decisions that affected the treatment, they could come in as

10

a defense and say, the reason I did not make any medical judgment

11

was because the plan didn't allow me to.

12

excluded that completely in a pure eligibility decision in the

13

court's words in Pegram.

14

in the state statute is that particular managed care entity,

15

exercised medical judgment.

22

MR. MATTAX: The statute provides that as a defense.

case, I as a managed care entity did not exercise any medical

25

judgments, because that's the defense -­

You're saying even if it's

not according to your standard of care, if it is not due under

MR. MATTAX: And what I'm saying there is -­

12

QUESTION: Have you said that?

13

MR. MATTAX: That is a defense to the claim.

And under

14

this Court's decision in Caterpillar versus Williams a defense

15

being raised to a claim does not create complete preemption.

16

QUESTION: Back to Pilot Life.

In my understanding of

the case, maybe I've got this wrong.

19

that's medically necessary.

20

23

Now you have a way of -- I mean isn't that what this is about?

25

Tell me if I do.

There's a

Then there's a person, it may be an

this judgment, I would like to get the benefits under the plan

and that would be a claim against the benefit plan.

has done has said, when a managed care entity, an HMO goes and

5

sells his products to a plan, or goes and sells its services to a

6

7

Texas will regulate the exercise of the medical judgment of that

8

managed care entity.

9
10

What Texas

QUESTION: It's not just an HMO, it's also a health
insurance carrier.

11

Here, AETNA.

MR. MATTAX: It is theoretically anyone who exercises

12

medical judgment that influences care.

But I think it is

13

important to recognize that the reasons for managed care as

14

stated by both the Petitioners here, and I would briefly quote

15

from a CIGNA brief, page 44.

16

designed to ensure that quality care is delivered as cost

17

efficiently as possible.

18

specifically says - - this in AETNA's petition or Appendix 88 - ­

19

as part of our commitment to provide access to quality care.

20

What the Court needs to recognize if I may, is that prior to the

21

rise of managed care, decisions were made on a retrospective

22

basis.

23

not believe it was medically necessary, we're not going to pay

24

for it.

it's simply a statement, we will not pay for it.

this particular program won't pay for it.

That doesn't

for your particular situation.

10

We don't think this care is appropriate

QUESTION: Well isn't it more a question of medical

necessity.

That is the plan says we'll cover it in case of

12

medical necessity, and the plan says we don't think there's

13

medical necessity here.

14

MR. MATTAX: Well the plan itself can put in as a term

15

medical necessity, but the plan is not making the determination

16

of whether it's medically necessary or not.

17

someone to make that determination for them. They may -­

18

They have hired

QUESTION: Well then it's certainly it's by the plan. I

19

mean the fact that an agent makes it rather than the plan doesn't

20

make any difference.

21

MR. MATTAX: But the reason to make that decision is

22

because the medical necessity decision is a result of a

23

determination by that managed care entity that they are going to

24

manage the care that's provided.

QUESTION: Well how much does that advance the argument?
I mean it's still a decision we won't pay for it.

and that is going to -- as a matter of practical reality, impact

and apart from ERISA.

But I don't see it at the moment.

23

MR. MATTAX: And I believe the answer to that question

24

is what the statute is concerned about is limiting and defining

25

the liability of employers and plan sponsors.

And a statute that

to that plan or plan sponsor, has no impact on the liability of

QUESTION: Just so you can -­

7

MR. ESTRADA: That is consistent with every case, from

Pilot Life, Taylor, and Ingersoll-Rand.

Because in each of those

cases, you were dealing with an insurance company that was acting

10

as a claim administrator or insurer with respect to an ERISA
