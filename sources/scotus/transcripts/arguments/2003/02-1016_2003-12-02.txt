ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. HARPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Deferred payments under section

11

1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) must equal the present value of the

12

collateral.

13

objective concept equalling the real interest rate and

14

inflation, which is the time value of money.

15

Historically present value has been an

The Seventh Circuit has redefined this concept

16

in a manner that seriously disrupts two fundamental

17

principles of chapter 13, that being the equal treatment

18

of creditors similarly situated and the debtor's

19

rehabilitation, the debtor's access to chapter 13.

20

QUESTION:

When you say traditionally it's been

21

understood to mean real interest rate plus time value of

22

money, it means real interest rate for the particular

23

lender.

24

given to different lenders is not always the same.

25

Isn't -- I mean, the -- the interest rate that is

MS. HARPER:

Under chapter 13, you're simply

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

trying to value the money.

2

specific creditor because you're just trying to equate the

3

amount of money over time to a particular amount of the

4

allowed secured claim.

5

QUESTION:

It's not particular to a

Well, that's right, but the interest

6

rate that I have to pay when I buy a house with a very

7

small down payment is much higher than the interest I have

8

to pay if I make a much larger down payment.

9

MS. HARPER:

10

QUESTION:

That's --

And the interest I have to pay, if I

11

make, you know, over $200,000 a year is less than I would

12

get if I have a lower income.

13

a fair interest rate in the abstract as though it's a --

14

it -- it's a platonic number floating out there.

15

certainly depends upon the solvency and -- and the record

16

of payment of the person paying the interest.

17

right?

So you can't just speak of

It

Isn't that

I --

18

MS. HARPER:

You're -- you're talking about

19

interest in the open market, though, which is not what

20

we're talking about here.

21

about --

22

QUESTION:

We're -- we're talking more

I'm surprised to hear you saying this

23

because I thought your brief acknowledged that even after

24

you begin with the -- with a discount rate, you know, the

25

-- the Fed's discount rate -- I thought your briefs

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

acknowledged that the bankruptcy court could add to that a

2

-- a surcharge depending upon the riskiness of the chapter

3

13 debtor.

4

MS. HARPER:

5

QUESTION:

That --

You didn't acknowledge that?

I

6

thought your brief acknowledged that.

7

really want to use the discount rate, period, and nothing

8

-- nothing tagged on top of it.

9

MS. HARPER:

I'm -- you -- you

I was going to get to that, but in

10

certain circumstances an additional risk factor may be

11

required, but it is our position that there are many other

12

statutory elements under -- provisions under chapter 13

13

that cover the types of risks that would normally be

14

included in a contract, for instance.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I think the same thing

16

that's bothering Justice Scalia, or that prompted his

17

question in any event, is -- is troubling me.

18

read the briefs, I -- I thought that the coerced loan

19

approach, which you object to, did have certain

20

deficiencies, because you had to have testimony what the

21

interest rate is, you have to conform it to the particular

22

transaction, it's hard to administer.

23

how yours is much different because you add a premium to

24

the prime rate.

25

shouldn't it depend on the transaction?

When I -- I

I frankly don't see

What is that premium going to be?

Why

Why shouldn't it

1

depend on the risk of default?

2

have all of the same problems as the coerced loan

3

approach?

4

MS. HARPER:

Why doesn't your approach

Because you need to limit the

5

purpose of that premium.

6

encompassed within other sections of chapter 13 because

7

your normal risk of deterioration of the collateral, for

8

instance -- that's adequate protection.

9

to add on for that.

Most risk elements are

So you don't have

You don't have -- the risk of default

10

is covered by the fact that there is a wage assignment in

11

effect.

12

I'm saying that in certain instances --

13

QUESTION:

Well, but if that was true, you could

14

bring up the same thing when you're cross-examining the

15

expert on the coerced loan approach and say, well, we

16

don't want 21 percent because there's a wage assignment.

17

It's the same answer.

18

MS. HARPER:

No.

The 21 percent, such as the 21

19

percent that was in this record, there was no support for

20

at all.

21

The creditor did not show any basis for -QUESTION:

It showed what the creditor had been

22

getting before, and that, I thought, was the argument,

23

that in -- out of chapter 17 -- 13, in chapter 13 our

24

contract rate was 21 percent, and that represents what it

25

would cost this borrower if he were today to take those

funds, get the same funds.

2

because he's a high-risk borrower.

3

theory.

4

Judge Rovner said in her opinion, but it's -- it's not

5

because it's more difficult to apply than some other

6

theory.

That's -- that's the

But you're saying that that is a wrong theory, as

7

MS. HARPER:

8

QUESTION:

9

It would cost him 21 percent

Well --

I think you're -- you're saying that

that's a wrong approach, and maybe you'll say why.

10

MS. HARPER:

Yes.

It's the wrong approach

11

because the only thing that the creditor is entitled to

12

protection for under 1325 is the value of the collateral.

13

In that 21 percent contract rate, first of all, on the

14

record in this case the expert couldn't even say what it

15

consisted of.

16

interest, you're going to have transaction charges.

17

You're going to have the risk of default, which has

18

already occurred here, the risk of bankruptcy default, for

19

instance.

20

creditor has already been compensated for that.

21

But in your typical contract rate of

That risk has already occurred here.

QUESTION:

The

You think that makes this a better --

22

a better borrower?

23

you're -- when you're -- you're owed money by somebody who

24

has already been through bankruptcy once?

25

you're in better shape?

It -- it makes it a safer loan when

You think

1

MS. HARPER:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

In many --

Gee, that's -- that's a novel

approach.
MS. HARPER:

In many respects, it is safer

5

because here you're talking about a subprime lender who

6

did enter into a contract where it assumed a great amount

7

of risk, but now the debtor's debt structure, his payment

8

obligations have been modified by the chapter 13.

9

QUESTION:

So you think a lender has two

10

different loan candidates in front of him, one he thinks

11

is going to go through bankruptcy and the other he thinks

12

is not, so he's going to give the loan to the first one?

13

MS. HARPER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

I think that --

That's -- that's very difficult for

me to assume.
MS. HARPER:

-- a lender may charge additional

17

interest if -- under State law if the lender has

18

indication that the debtor may go through bankruptcy, but

19

normally in the subprime market, that's all factored in

20

because most subprime candidates are candidates for

21

possible bankruptcy in the future.

22
23

QUESTION:

Is it a fact that most chapter 13

bankrupts don't make it to the end of the program?

24

MS. HARPER:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

In fact, the vast majority fail.

MS. HARPER:

That's not necessarily true when

you talk --

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. HARPER:

I thought we had statistics on that.
The problem is most of the

5

statistics focus on the default rate just from the filing,

6

the number of filings.

7

rate after the chapter 13 has been confirmed because there

8

are many -- the case by that point has been reviewed by

9

the court and it's determined to have been feasible.

10

debtor by that point has been making payments for a

11

substantial period.

12

QUESTION:

13

They don't focus on the default

The

Are there statistics on that kind of

cases that you're describing now?

14

MS. HARPER:

There -- I have found limited

15

statistics.

16

of the chapter 13's completed successfully after they

17

reached the point of confirmation.

18

that after the point of confirmation, the success rate

19

gets much higher, which only makes sense because a lot of

20

times --

21
22

One study that I found said that 63 percent

It's still not a very good risk.

I

mean, you --

23

MS. HARPER:

QUESTION:

25

So there is suggestion

Well --

-- you lend money to somebody.

Your

chances of getting it back are 2 out of 3?

MS. HARPER:

QUESTION:

So --

Well, I think it's better than 2 out

of 3.

6

The subprime lender's risk in the

MS. HARPER:

It's five times higher than the

prime market.

7

QUESTION:

Let -- let me ask you a -- the -- the

8

way I see these two approaches.

9

you're -- you're willing to allow over the prime rate some

10

addition which the -- the courts that -- that follow your

11

-- your favored approach do allow for risk factor.

12

under your theory, you take the prime rate, and then it is

13

up to the bankruptcy judge to assess what the risk is,

14

something that I think judges are probably not very well

15

qualified to do.

16

I'm assuming that -- that

So

You know when -- when you pick the prime rate,

17

that that's not the market rate.

It obviously isn't.

18

it's well below the market rate.

I mean, here you had a

19

21 percent loan and you're going to take what?

20

know.

21

wrong.

And then the bankruptcy judge has to make it

22

right.

Okay?

23

A prime rate of 8 percent at most?

So

I don't

You know it's

Under the other approach, you take the market

24

rate, the rate that was actually adopted between these --

25

these two people operating in a free market.

Now, it --

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it may be -- may be high, it may be low.

2

for sure that it's either one.

3

accurate.

It is not surely inaccurate the way picking the

4

prime is.

And then the adjustment to be made by the

5

bankruptcy judge is much less.

6

factors that show a lesser risk now than there was when

7

the loan was originally made, he might take them into

8

account.

9

You don't know

It's -- it's -- it may be

If there are some special

Now, as I see it, the less discretion that is

10

left to the bankruptcy judge and the more weight that is

11

given to the -- to the real forces of the operating

12

market, the better off we are.

13

bankruptcy judges are very good risk calculators.

14

MS. HARPER:

I -- I don't think that

That totally eliminates the fact

15

that a chapter 13 has been filed and that there are

16

certain minimal requirements for chapter 13 confirmation.

17

A -- and the problem is that market rate, the way these

18

courts have defined it -- has come to mean anything and

19

everything.

20

rates here.

21

We're talking about two different market

QUESTION:

I'm talking about using the rate of

22

the loan that was actually made.

23

MS. HARPER:

But there is nothing in the statute

24

that requires the creditor to be compensated for all of

25

those items that were included in the pre-petition

QUESTION:

No, but he has to be given the

3

current value of his security and the current value of his

4

security, which is not going to be received 20 years from

5

now or 5 years from now, depends upon how much of a credit

6

risk there is that that money will actually be paid.

7

MS. HARPER:

How could the -- how could you

8

possibly contract in advance for the present value of this

9

particular allowed secured claim, $4,000?

That amount

10

wasn't even known when the contract rate was established.

11

The contract rate was based upon particular

12

characteristics of the creditor and the debtor and many --

13

QUESTION:

In -- in an open market.

And if the

14

debtor could have gotten -- it's a very competitive

15

market, as I understand it.

16

gotten a lower rate elsewhere, he presumably would have.

17

MS. HARPER:

18

QUESTION:

And if the debtor could have

That's --

I'm just saying that that's -- that

19

that's a reasonable starting point.

20

be an adjustment because market rates have gone down since

21

then, that minor adjustment can be made, but that's going

22

to be much less of an adjustment than you're going to have

23

to leave to the bankruptcy judge if you begin with the

24

prime rate which you know is wrong.

25

would have made this -- this car loan at the prime rate.

Now, if there has to

1

MS. HARPER:

That's not the question.

The

2

question is not what someone would make a new loan for

3

because an allowed secured claim in chapter 13 is a claim.

4

It's not a loan.

5

Once the bankruptcy is filed --

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this -- this piece of

pick-it discretion to the bankruptcy judge is a worrisome

8

thing, but all of the cases that take this approach, the

9

Treasury bill approach or the prime, seem to have a rather

The -- Justice Scalia said to give this kind of you-

10

narrow range for that risk factor.

11

to 3 percent, and none of them go over 3 percent.

12

did they -- where did that range -- who invented that

13

range that 3 percent would be the ceiling?

14

MS. HARPER:

They go from 1 percent

That's a good question.

Where

I believe

15

that it just results from the fact that in your typical

16

chapter 13, you don't have a lot of special risk that has

17

to be compensated for because you usually have the fixed

18

asset, there's no hazard -- hazardous use, you've got a

19

wage assignment.

20

for instance, in a chapter 13 if you had a balloon

21

payment.

You -- substantial risk might result,

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. HARPER:

A what payment?
A balloon payment instead of

24

periodic weekly payments, which is usually what you have

25

in a chapter 13.

QUESTION:

10

But he conceded under cross-

That's --

-- to my mind is conceding that he

has no basis for picking 1.5 percent.

11

MS. HARPER:

That 1.5 in that case was actually

12

a local bankruptcy rule.

13

testified that prime already includes 2 percent which

14

could not be accounted for except for risk and transaction

15

fees.

MS. HARPER:

borrowing on a new loan in a chapter 13.

20

talking about modification to an old loan, an existing

21

loan.

we're not looking at what this debtor would have to pay in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

7
8
9

MR. SALMONS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The court of appeals here held that the

10

bankruptcy courts are required to presume that the pre-

11

bankruptcy contract rate of interest, which varies from

12

creditor to creditor and could range anywhere from 0 to 40

13

percent or more in some jurisdictions, is the appropriate

14

discount rate to use in calculating the present value of

15

plan payments under section 1325.

16

mistaken, we submit, for three principal reasons.

17

Now, that approach is

First, it violates the core bankruptcy principle

18

of equality of distribution for similarly situated

19

creditors.

20

creditors could make car loans to the same debtor that

21

resulted in allowed secured claims of equal value, and yet

22

one would receive thousands more in plan payments solely

23

because the other made its car loan at a time when the

24

debtor's financial troubles had not yet become obvious.

25

Under the court of appeals' approach, two

QUESTION:

Is that right?

I just want to be

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sure I understand the -- the point.

2

that differential before the bankruptcy judge, it's a --

3

the original is a presumptive risk, and the judge could

4

then resolve it by maybe compromising between the two.

5

MR. SALMONS:

I thought if you had

Your Honor, this is an important

6

point because I think there is some misconception about

7

what the court of appeals held in this case, and I think

8

that's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least

9

as I read their position, are not really defending the

10

approach taken by the court of appeals.

11

appeals did not adopt a presumption in favor of the pre-

12

bankruptcy contract rate because it thought that that

13

represented accurately the relevant market, if you will,

14

for the risks of -- and benefits and protections that

15

exist under the Bankruptcy Code.

16

The court of

In fact, under the court of appeals' approach,

17

the risk of nonpayment is really irrelevant.

18

court of appeals says is that because the -- the creditor

19

is denied use of funds for the period of the payment plan,

20

that it therefore is entitled to whatever rate it would

21

have gone out and funded a new loan at if it had been

22

allowed to foreclose and reinvest the proceeds.

23

QUESTION:

What the

Now --

I agree with you, and -- and the

24

respondent is not defending that approach, but rather the

25

approach that you use the rate of the -- of the original

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

loan as the starting point, and then adjust it as

2

necessary.

3

MR. SALMONS:

That's correct, and I just want to

4

emphasize, though, that -- that the adjustment that the

5

court of appeals would make is not one I think that

6

anybody before the Court now would defend because the

7

court of appeals would adjust only if you could prove that

8

the -- a particular secured creditor is now making loans

9

at some other rate and there's no reason to think why that

10

has anything to do with what the present value of plan

11

MR. SALMONS:

If respondent's view is that you

should have a presumption in favor of the pre-bankruptcy

17

contract rate, then that would be the result.

18

clear to me is whether it's actually respondent's view

19

that you should have a presumption in favor of the

20

subprime contract rate or the highest contract rate

allowed by State law because it's important to remember

that pre-bankruptcy contract rates are going to vary.

it's undisputed that inflation and the time value of money

MR. SALMONS:

MR. SALMONS:

Why begin with -- with something -Your Honor, the answer to your

question --

abysmally low except for the fact that it will mean less

12

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor -- Your Honor, the

answer to your question --

13

14

MR. SALMONS:

The answer to your question is

2

read the statute so there's no risk of nonpayment at all

because the statute refers to property to be distributed

approach, and what you see happening -- Justice Ginsburg,

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The creditor did bring in two

would be charged a 21 percent rate of interest.

QUESTION:

Well, can you tell me why is it that

the petitioners tell us that their standard is so much

easier to administer?

As I listened to it,

it seems to me I have two choices.

I can begin with a low

rate and add or I can begin with a high rate and -- and

subtract.

than -- than the other?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

QUESTION:

Is it because the courts aren't

Why -- why is one any more easy to administer

Because --

In fact, it -- it would seem to me --

10

and this I suppose helps you -- that if the courts which

11

are using the petitioners' formula are doing it the right

12

way, it might even be harder to administer.

13

avoid that problem by just accepting some interest factor

14

of 1 to 3 percent out of the blue although I don't know

15

how they do that.

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

They -- they

Well, Justice Kennedy, what we

17

have is we have three circuits which have adopted the

18

formula approach, and so we have the experience of the

19

courts in those circuits, and we have the balance of the

20

circuits, approximately seven, that have taken more of the

21

market rate approach.

22

in those situations where the bankruptcy courts are

23

applying the formula approach, they are systematically

24

giving chapter 13 debtors a rate of interest pretty close

25

to prime.

And what we see happening is that

Now, that can't be correct.

That gives the

QUESTION:

Would it satisfy you if we said this?

4

Suppose we said we see what we're after here.

The

5

objective is to equate the stream of payments plus

6

repossession with $4,000.

7

it can't be lower than the prime.

8

the creditor wants to come in and give a -- present his

9

evidence, the contract, of how risky this person is, then

Now, on the one hand, we know
On the other hand, if

in fact it is evidence absolutely.

12

pluses and the minuses, what's happened to the interest

14

risk, and he'll choose a number.

15

like that all the time?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

QUESTION:

MR. BRUNSTAD:

No, Your Honor.

And here's why.

If not -- because?
Because the true market rate of

23

interest is almost always going to be at least the

24

contract rate, presumptive contract rate, because the

25

costs in chapter 13 are so much more extraordinarily

Correct, Your Honor.

So if we're going to do it your way

21

and say, well, now, suppose the lender foreclosed on the

would have to use not the replacement value, the higher

the contract rate because I know that must be wrong.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

No, Your Honor.

We could say take the contract rate

The correct standard is I think to recognize,
which I think Your Honor does, that this concept of

11

one, and that essentially what we're doing is we're saying

12

there is a stream of payments to be made here and we have

13

to figure out what it's worth.

14

it's worth would be what the market says.

15

The best test for what

Now, the problem is, is that in chapter 11 there

16

is a market.

17

the standard is the same in chapter 11 as 13:

18

the effective date of the plan under 1129.

19

we have to be very careful about is in chapter 11, the

20

markets do value debtors' promises to pay and they lend

money and they charge very high interest rates.

QUESTION:

I -- I don't think it's certainly

3

conclusive of the point, but the initial 21 percent rate,

4

I take it, did take into account the risk of default.

5

in a sense, the creditor has received up front some

compensation for the risk that in fact has occurred.

7

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, but at the time the loan is

made, Your Honor, we don't know who in the pool of -- of

debtors is going to default.

12

QUESTION:

Once the default happens --

Well, but -- but overall, you account

for that.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

Overall the risks are spread, but

13

if you force the secured party to systematically subsidize

14

interest rates to chapter 13 debtors, who have now

15

demonstrated by their filing they are the riskiest of the

16

risky, what you will eventually have happen is a

contraction of the ability to lend.

QUESTION:

charge 21 percent, and a lot of people are going to

successfully pay that and that stream there takes into

consideration some account for those who don't pay and go

into bankruptcy, doesn't it?

Yes, Your Honor, but we shouldn't

price, you're going to get a debtor who will be able to --

debtor got an expert.

Who -- who paid the expert?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I do not know the answer to that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But isn't it typical that these

experts?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

No.

They often have lawyers,

Your Honor.
But let me suggest this.

If the Court were to

5

set the rate at the presumptive -- the contract rate as

6

the presumptive rate, this is what would happen and this

7

is what has happened in circuits where that is so.

8

the contract rate becomes the presumptive rate, and in

9

most cases the debtor will offer that in its plan -- in

The --

10

his or her plan as the appropriate rate.

11

doesn't like that, we'll offer less of a rate and then

12

what happens is a negotiation.

13

secured party get together and they negotiate based upon

14

the debtor's presentation of this is why I think it should

15

be adjusted off of that because my circumstances have

16

improved or there's a lot of equity in this particular

17

collateral, so your risks are less, so you're more

18

protected.

19

and then the parties can negotiate.

20

If the debtor

And the debtor and the

And those various reasons can then be given,

If, however, you set a standard where the

21

bankruptcy court is just simply going to decide based upon

22

the evidence that the parties put in, we're not going to

23

adopt the formula approach, then you'll be back to the

24

problem where we are before, lots of litigation.

25

because the contract rate is the best evidence of a -- of

a market rate between these parties, it should be the

2

presumptive rate and we should work from that.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any --

4

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question that's run

5

through my mind listening to this argument?

6

the Rash case, was it, that we --

Going back to

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

-- we did not there -- the majority

9

did not there.

I was in dissent in that case.

10

MR. BRUNSTAD:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

-- did not take the case to try and

12

replicate what would have happened if there had been no

13

bankruptcy.

14

now, you're in effect asking we do treat the case as close

15

as possible to what you would have negotiated in a free

16

market.

17

They said, we won't -- won't treat it as a --

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Not quite, Your Honor.

I think

18

actually this is the same analysis as in Rash.

19

Court said in Rash that the parties had to do was the

20

debtor had to go out -- the debtor already has the truck

21

-- had the truck in Rash -- is go out and see what it

22

would have cost the debtor to replace that truck.

23

didn't actually do it, but simply say what would it have

24

cost.

25

The same principle applies here.

What the

It

The debtor

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

should actually go out and see what would someone pay.

2

How much would someone charge to finance this debtor's

3

loan?

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but in doing that, they were

5

saying, we're going to do that instead of trying to

6

predict what would happen to -- in the normal course of

7

events between the contracting parties if bankruptcy had

8

not intervened.

9

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, that's true.

In this case,

10

though, that also applies.

11

bankruptcy had not intervened is the secured party would

12

have foreclosed, repossessed the collateral, and avoided

13

all the costs.

14
15

QUESTION:

What would happen if

But not at replacement value.

You

would not have gotten replacement value.

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That's true, Your Honor, but the

17

reason why you have replacement value is because the

18

debtor is going to keep the -- the collateral and prevents

19

the secured party from exercising its rights and forces

20

the secured party to incur costs that it otherwise would

21

avoid.

22

Now, the whole purpose of the value requirement

23

and the indubitable equivalent concept and the whole

24

cramdown standard is to make sure the secured party

25

doesn't -- isn't shouldered with uncompensated risk.

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So the question becomes what's best method of

2

compensating the secured party for its risk.

3

statute, because of what it requires, value as of the

4

effective date of the plan using an economic concept, says

5

we basically have to value the stream of payments.

6

really is willing to say I would give this debtor $4,000

7

or take this debtor's promise of payment of $4,000 at --

8

at a prime rate or anything close to a prime rate.

the contract date is the best evidence of a market

10

valuation that we have.

Is there any --- to be faithful to the statute.

14
15

QUESTION:

Is there any indication that if we

16

take that, that in fact it will increase the likelihood of

17

default under the plan simply because the higher contract

18

rate will tend to put more pressure on the -- the debtor

19

than the debtor in fact ultimately can -- can satisfy?

20

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, Your Honor, in the circuits

21

where that already is the standard, that the -- that the

22

presumptive rate is basically the rate that we use.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BRUNSTAD:

25

Yes.

What is their experience?

There -- there is no information

to say it's higher default rate.

And certainly the fact

QUESTION:

But it seems pretty obvious if it's a

higher rate, there are going to be more defaults.

7

MR. BRUNSTAD:

8

Honor, for this reason.

9

-- the debtor does not make payments directly to creditors

Well, not necessarily, Your
Because the debtor makes -- the

10

under the chapter 13 plan.

11

the chapter 13 trustee as a dispersing agent, and the

12

chapter 13 trustee then distributes the money.

13

you're doing here is you're reallocating in this case a

14

few hundred dollars away from unsecured creditors toward

15

the secured creditor because, again, the statute says the

16

secured creditor is not required to take -- shoulder

17

uncompensated risk for the benefit of anybody else.

That's --
