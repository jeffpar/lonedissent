ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

10

In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner

11

Buck Doe suffered an adverse effect, the emotional

12

distress typical of a privacy invasion caused by the

13

Department of Labor's intentional and willful violation of

14

the Privacy Act.

15

circumstances, petitioner is entitled to recover the

16

Privacy Act's modest $1,000 statutory damages remedy.

17

The only question is whether under these

QUESTION: Before we go further, could you help

18

me out on one thing?

19

recovery.

20

fact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this

21

case, for example, for every caption of a - of - of an

22

order that went out, to everyone to whom that order was

23

sent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many,

24

many thousands.

25

statute?

You spoke of the modest $1,000

The argument is made on the other side that, in

Is that the proper construction of the

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. CAMPBELL: The answer to that is no, Justice

2

Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways.

3

First of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already

4

held that the number of - that the $1,000 is key to each

5

individual and not to the number of disclosures.

6

example, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there

7

was a simultaneous disclosure of information about a

8

single individual to some 4,000 recipients.

9

held -

For

That court

10

QUESTION: Okay.

11

MR. CAMPBELL: - and I think correctly, that that

12

would be considered one disclosure under the act and,

13

thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single

14

$1,000 recovery.

15

QUESTION: What if - what if there had been an

16

initial disclosure and he had protested it?

17

you're violating the statute when you do this and they did

18

it again.

19

He said,

Would that be a separate offense?
MR. CAMPBELL: That's a closer question - it -

20

because then you - you've got the - the temporal

21

separation that did not exist in the Tomasello case.

22

QUESTION: Yeah, but you'd have temporal

23

separation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10

24

months.

25

MR. CAMPBELL: But -

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: And I take it in that case you're

2

saying, no, there would still just be a - a - a one

3

violation and - and the maximum recovery, at least under

4

this provision, would be 1,000.

5

MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I think that's right,

6

Justice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each

7

of those disclosures you're describing, there would have

8

to be an adverse effect described and - and a causation

9

element met in each of those in any case before you even

10

got to the question.

11

QUESTION: But suppose the IRS -

12

QUESTION: But that's so easy to establish, as

13

shown here.

14

knows my Social Security number.

15

realistic reason for not assuming application of the

16

statute, do you?

I mean, it bothers me that somebody else
You don't think that's a

17

MR. CAMPBELL: I - if I understand your question,

18

Justice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm

19

suffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless

20

standard.

21

situation in which Buck Doe - it's obviously a pseudonym -

22

And in this case, you don't just have a

just alleges, I was harmed.

This is a case in which he

23

submitted an affidavit, and more importantly, testified in

24

open court as to the severity and veracity of his

25

emotional -

1

QUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -

2

MR. CAMPBELL: - and was cross-examined.

3

QUESTION: - wouldn't every person who wanted to

4

make such a claim make similar allegations?

5

action a reasonable possibility in a case like this?

6

Is a class

MR. CAMPBELL: Let me answer both parts of your

7

question.

8

presume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse

9

effect.

As to the first part, I - I don't think we can

They are certainly under the obligations to

10

testify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had

11

every opportunity that - to - and did cross-examine Mr.

12

Doe as to the veracity of his adverse effect.

13

magistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an

14

adverse effect, the district court adopted it and the

15

Government never appealed that finding, so whatever

16

arguments they have at this point are gone.

17

The

Second part of your question, class actions.

18

That's certainly the parade of horribles that the

19

Government is trotting out here, and I think perhaps,

20

Justice Souter, may go more - more directly to your

21

question as well.

22

individual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an

23

intentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to

24

a statutory damages award without being required to

25

quantify actual damages.

The answer is no.

Even if an

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

There are still at least two individualized

2

issues that will exist in every case.

3

and proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may

4

vary among different plaintiffs.

5

and particularly in the causation question, Justice

6

O'Connor, this is not a - a standard that - that

7

plaintiffs lightly leap over.

8
9

One is the pleading

Second is the causation,

In fact, there are a number of cases, one of
which is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which

10

was handed down while this petition was pending, noted

11

that in cases where the - the adverse effect alleged is a

12

- an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run

13

into causation problems.

14

other stressors in this person's life.

15

There could be any number of

QUESTION: Let's assume that somebody wrongfully

16

and intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you

17

know, just - just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers

18

of their - their entire list.

19

list to somebody.

20

class action?

21

effect of having his Social Security number out there, and

22

every one of them has this same adverse effect, which is

23

the, I don't know, the trauma of knowing that - that your

24

- your Social Security number is floating out there where

25

anybody can use it.

They sell their - their

Why wouldn't that be a perfectly valid

Every one of them has had the adverse

Why wouldn't that be a perfectly good

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

class action?

2

MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I think that the example

3

you give, the problem remains, particularly one of

4

causation.

5

they may not be concerned, I think, particularly if you're

6

describing a case in which it's only the number that's

7

released but the number's not linked to a name.

8

in those cases you might have difficulty.

9
10
11

Some folks may not have an adverse effect,

QUESTION: Those numbers are - are linked to
names.
MR. CAMPBELL: I'd still go back to the - there's

12

a causation problem.

13

is an individualized issue.

14

I think

If - if you're going to talk - that
Now, I -

QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to that, you

15

brought this case.

16

as a class action and you were unsuccessful.

17

hear you telling this Court, we were way off-base in

18

attempting to bring this as a class action because the

19

adverse effect is different for each person.

20

giving up on your first loss.

21

circuits that might say, yeah, why not class action?

22

I mean, you tried to get it certified
So I - I

So you're

I mean, there are other

MR. CAMPBELL: I don't - I don't - I don't

23

contend that there aren't arguments to be made.

24

stating here is that there are some very strong -

25

What I am

QUESTION: But you say you lost fair and square,

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and now you've seen the error of your ways?

2

MR. CAMPBELL: Well, we lost fair and square and

3

I - and I want to point out too, I want to give another

4

example of a case, and it's one of the cases that the

5

Government cites in its brief as the example of - of this

6

- this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is

7

pending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which

8

involves a putative class action against the Veterans

9

Administration.

In that case, the Western District of

10

Wisconsin held, and this has been since cert was granted

11

in this case, held that, if you prove an adverse effect

12

caused by an intentional, willful violation of the act,

13

you are entitled to statutory damages of $1,000.

14

Nonetheless, that district court refused to certify a

15

class on precisely the grounds that I am describing to you

16

today.

17
18
19

So is it conceivable there could be a class
action in a case?

Yes, it's conceivable, and I do -

QUESTION: But even if they're not class actions,

20

I have, I think, the same problem people have expressed.

21

In Massachusetts, we put our Social Security number on our

22

driver's license.

23

it 10 million times a day, or however many.

24

that, you know, the IRS releases - California wants to do

25

the same thing.

I have it right in my pocket.

I show

So suppose

They have 35 million drivers, and the IRS

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sends them a list so they can check it out, or the Social

2

Security Administration does that and, my God, there's 35

3

million lawsuits, $1,000 each, that's only 35 billion.

4

Suppose they do it nationwide.

5

that's only Social Security numbers.

6

is read through these 14 pages of fine print of the

7

requirements of the Privacy Act, certain days have to be

8

met, certain deadlines, and it's very easy to imagine

9

bankruptcy in the Federal Treasury.

10

All right.

There's 200 billion, and
All you have to do

So, I mean, you know, trillions,

11

it's easy to see that.

12

I'll spare you, but you see where I'm going, because what

13

I want is that is the horrible.

14

horrible, I think, my God, they're right.

15

Now, you tell me why they're not.

16

I can make up hypotheticals, which

And when I read the
All right.

MR. CAMPBELL: In the hypothetical that you're

17

proposing, Justice Breyer, I think there are several

18

answers.

19
20

QUESTION: And just make up, you know, it's easy
for both of us to make up a lot.

21

MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.

22

QUESTION: I want to know what are the

23

protections if you win against generating millions and

24

millions of lawsuits with billions of dollars.

25

MR. CAMPBELL: In - in the hypotheticals that

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you've described, if I could take those on their terms

2

first. It's very likely that one of the exceptions to the

3

Privacy Act disclosure is going to apply usual - if it's

4

the case that - that this is a working relationship

5

between the Federal Government and various state

6

governments and the like, that may well fall within the

7

usual use.

8
9

There are a number of these exceptions listed,
so certainly you have to look to those first.

Have to go

10

- go back to - this would have to be intentionally

11

wrongful conduct by the Government -

12

QUESTION: Well, yeah, I can't imagine any

13

government agency that takes place that isn't intentional.

14

You always have people intending to do what they do in the

15

Government.

16

MR. CAMPBELL: Well -

17

QUESTION: Nobody released these - nobody -

18

nobody puts anything on a piece of paper, releases it,

19

isn't intentional.

20

MR. CAMPBELL: Certainly the - the intent to

21

release the - the information would be correct, but that's

22

not the same as to say there was an intent to violate the

23

Privacy Act.

24
25

QUESTION: Ah, in other words, in order to
recover - now, that's an important point to me - in order

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to recover, the plaintiff has to show that the government

2

individuals or the agency not only intended to do what did

3

violate the act, but they intended that what they did

4

would violate the Act.

5

willful, it's like they knew about the legal obligation

6

and they intentionally violated it.

They knew about the - that's

7

MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct, Justice -

8

QUESTION: Well, then, how did you ever win this

9

one?

10
11

QUESTION:

That's - that's - that's a very

strong -

12

QUESTION: Yeah, very strong.

13

QUESTION: - instruction.

Ordinary - ignorance

14

of the law is - is no defense, and there are all sorts of

15

statutes that use the word willful, which simply means

16

that you intended to do the act that you did, not that you

17

knew it violated the law.

18
19
20

MR. CAMPBELL: Well, in - in this case - I - the
consistent constructions of - of the Privacy Act is it's it's greater than gross negligence.

It - it necessarily

21

encompasses more than just I intended to do something.

22

It's that I - I willfully blind to my obligations in the -

23
24
25

QUESTION: Well, how about this case?

How - how

was that shown in this case?

MR. CAMPBELL: In pages - if I could point the

by administrative law judges -

6

MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct.

7

QUESTION: - of hearing notices and decisions?

8

MR. CAMPBELL: That - among other things.

9

answer is yes, Justice O'Connor.

The

On pages 96A to 97A of

10

the petitioner's appendix, there is the description of the

11

magistrate judge's finding that there was a willful

12

violation of the Privacy Act here and that there was a -

13

there was no attempt even - no even attempt to comply with

14

the act's requirements, and I - I would point -

15

QUESTION: But to say there's no intent to comply

16

isn't the same thing as saying that you knew you were

17

violating the act when you acted.

18

MR. CAMPBELL: Well, let me amend my answer in

19

this way, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

willful ignoring of the act's requirements would qualify

21

as a willful - and I - I want to -

22
23
24
25

A willful ignorance - a

QUESTION: Well, how can you - how can you
willfully ignore an act's requirements?
MR. CAMPBELL: Well, the Department of Labor was
well aware of what the Privacy Act's requirements were and

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

made no attempt to get the administrative law judges to

2

comply, and - and I want to go back here this - to one of

3

the answers I gave with respect to your adverse effect

4

questions.

5

judge, adopted by the district court, and this was never

6

appealed by the Federal Government.

This issue was decided by the magistrate

7

QUESTION: Well, but our concern -

8

QUESTION: We're concerned here, Justice Breyer

9

and I guess - what is going to happen if we rule in your

10

favor?

11

the Government on this ground, but are we just opening a

12

can of worms or is - by ruling in your favor?

That will probably not result in any benefit for

13

MR. CAMPBELL: The answer is no, and - and

14

certainly I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, and Justice

15

Souter and Justice Breyer, that in future cases there

16

might well be a lot more time spent litigating the issues

17

of whether there was an adverse - truly an adverse effect

18

and whether - and - and whether the - the violation was

19

truly intentional and willful.

20
21

But I want to -

QUESTION: Okay, but can - can we just go back to
that for a second?

22

MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.

23

QUESTION: Because we've been concentrating on

24

willful, and you say, well, willful requires a very high

25

standard.

As - as you just indicated in your answers, the

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute doesn't require willful.

2

or willful.

It requires intentional

3

MR. CAMPBELL: Or willful.

4

QUESTION: And it would be even more remarkable

5

to construe the - the term intentional as requiring

6

conscious disregard of - of a known statutory obligation.

7

MR. CAMPBELL: Let - let me answer this way in

8

response, and maybe it will - will help ease the concerns.

9

For 22 years, the interpretation of the Privacy Act that

10

petitioner offers today has been the law of the land, and

11

in that -

12

QUESTION: Do you have a case that says

13

intentional standing alone must be construed to include

14

this conscious disregard of a - of a known legal

15

provision?

16

MR. CAMPBELL: I can't cite a specific case for

17

that proposition, Justice Souter, but I again go back to

18

we were talking about intentional or willful, it's a high

19

burden under any concept of what intentional or willful

20

will be, and for years, for 22 years, from 1975 to, at the

21

earliest 1997, when the Sixth Circuit decided the Reno

22

case, the interpretation that I am offering this Court is

23

the one that the courts of appeals had unanimously

24

adopted, and never in those 22 years had the kind of

25

parade of horribles that the Government posits in this

case materialize.
Indeed, if anything, if you look - there is a a reporter that lists every single case decided under the
Privacy Act since 1975.
QUESTION: But have any of those cases involved
disclosure of Social Security numbers?
MR. CAMPBELL: None that I recall.

That seems to

be a relatively new QUESTION: See, this seems to me a particular

10

kind of disclosure that might happen over and over again

11

in a very casual way.

12

MR. CAMPBELL: I - I submit, Justice Stevens, if

13

it happens in a casual way, that's not going to provide

14

anyone with a cause of action.

15

QUESTION: Well, pursuant to a policy such as

16

they had here of that's the way they use to identify -

17

driver's license they use it on, the Holiday Inn uses it

18

for their social - all sorts of people use Social Security

19

number for another purpose.

20

MR. CAMPBELL: That's true.

It's certainly true

21

that Social Security numbers are used for other purposes.

22

But what is clear from this statute is that Congress was

23

specifically focused on concerns about Social Security

24

numbers being disclosed and the adverse effects that can

25

result from that.

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: That - that may be true.

What's

2

bothering me, which may be the same thing, as Justice

3

Stevens says, is that I might have thought that a Labor

4

Department official could reasonably think, I have a list

5

of 50,000 people here, several are named John Smith, I

6

want to be sure we get the right ones so I'll put the

7

Social Security number as identifier.

8

- on its face seem like such an unreasonable thing to

9

think, even if it's wrong.

10

That doesn't on its

And - and yet we have here a finding that not

11

only is it wrong, but that it's intentional and willful,

12

and that's what brings up the problem you come to argue,

13

and I don't know how to deal with it, because I think,

14

well, if this statute, intentional, willful really means

15

the tough thing that you say, well, then it'll work, then

16

you're right, there won't be a horrible.

17

this case, which seems to me to stand for the proposition

18

that that tough standard isn't being applied.

19

think, my goodness, you're opening the door to the

20

horribles and - and I don't know how to do it because the

21

other part isn't being argued.

22

I put it to you.

23

But then I see

And then I

That's my honest dilemma.

MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I under - I well

24

understand your dilemma, Justice Breyer, and I again go

25

back to, I don't doubt if this - if the statute is given

its natural reading, that the $1,000 statutory damages is

2

available to those to whom the United States shall be

3

liable, there will be an awful lot more traction, a lot

4

more fighting over the adverse effect and the particular

5

circumstances that would rise to the level of an

6

intentional or willful violation in the future.

7

QUESTION: Mr. Campbell -

8

MR. CAMPBELL: That's simply not an issue here.

9

QUESTION: Really what - what Justice Breyer is

10

saying is - is that this issue of willfulness or not is

11

not in the case and we wish it were, because the answer to

12

that is important.

13

is in the case?

14
15

Could we talk a little bit about what

MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes, Justice Scalia, thank
you.

16

QUESTION: Can - can you tell me what - I - I

17

really have trouble understanding how there can be an

18

adverse effect without actual damage.

19

strange line.

20

Procedure Act, you talk about any person adversely

21

affected or aggrieved, and that's a person who suffered

22

damage.

23

language that - that sets up two different categories,

24

adverse effect on the one hand, and actual damage on the

25

other.

That's a very

I mean, in - in the Administrative

It seems very strange for Congress to use

When - when is there an adverse effect without

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

actual damage?

2

MR. CAMPBELL: I think there frequently can be an

3

- an emotional harm that is not quantifiable in dollar

4

terms -

5

QUESTION: Well -

6

MR. CAMPBELL: - and that's very common in the

7

law.

8
9

QUESTION: That doesn't mean that it's not
actual.

It just means that it's hard to quantify, but

10

you've had the emotional harm.

11

isn't that actual - actual harm?

12

Why isn't that an - why

MR. CAMPBELL: I - I want - I - I agree with you

13

that that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the

14

things that the Government is - is trying to cloud the

15

issue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual

16

damages and actual harm.

17

that the - in - in interpreting the statute, the

18

deliberate use of a term adverse effect and the deliberate

19

use of a term actual damages, those must be given

20

different meanings.

21

I submit they are different,

QUESTION: Well, do you agree that, or do you

22

contend that adverse effect include - includes emotional

23

distress and that you have to show something like

24

emotional distress before there is an adverse effect?

25

MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy,

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal

2

courts on that question.

3

QUESTION: What - what do you say about the

4

position of the - which I understood the circuit to be

5

taking that, on the assumption that there - there was some

6

emotional damage, at least in the sense that the - the man

7

said, I was very upset when I heard that the number was

8

out.

9

saying, there is a category of harm that is generally non­

10

compensable in the law, and we assume it ought to be non­

11

compensable here, and that category is emotional damage,

12

which has no physical manifestation.

13

policy behind that is, we don't allow generally, tort law

14

doesn't allow recovery there because it's too easy to

15

fake.

Assuming that, I thought the Fourth Circuit was

And the general

16

And the Fourth Circuit, I thought, was saying,

17

you know, whether you're talking about damage or whether

18

you're talking about effect, this is an effect that the

19

law simply doesn't generally recognize and it shouldn't be

20

recognized here.

21

can be quantified or not.

22

you don't even get to the point of proving quantification.

23

What - what is your response to that?

24
25

That's a different issue from whether it
What the circuit was saying is,

MR. CAMPBELL: If that is indeed what the Fourth
Circuit's position is, it's squarely wrong.

At common law

and intentional torts generally, and in privacy torts

2

specifically, this type of harm is compensable in some at

3

least minimal way, even if it cannot be quantified, and I

4

think that's why -

5
6
7

QUESTION: What about - even if there is no
physical manifestation?
MR. CAMPBELL: Even if there is no physical

8

manifestation.

9

there's nothing surprising about the overall remedial

Indeed, I submit, Justice Souter, it's -

10

scheme here, because it does track what happened at common

11

law and intentional torts and with respect to intentional

12

privacy torts.

13

even than what was required at common law.

14

even no damage at all, no - I'm sorry - I don't - I don't

15

want to get back into the confusion over the terms.

16

if there was no harm at all, there would be still be some

17

at least minimal award, recognizing the invasion.

In fact, the Privacy Act is more strict

privacy argument, but that's because the invasion of

privacy or the infringement of privacy is regarded simply

are talking about an adverse effect, so we are talking

17

about having to prove a harm.

about the ability to vindicate a privacy interest in the

QUESTION: And what - can - can you - and this

goes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the difference in adverse effect and actual damage?

2
3

MR. CAMPBELL: The difference is the ability to
quantify the harm in some dollar amount.

4

QUESTION: Yes, but if that's - if that's the

5

case, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to

6

identity theft would be increased by the disclosure of

7

your Social Security number, and if that's true, and I

8

think some people could prove the risk is increased, that

9

would be true of every release of every Social Security

10

number.

11

MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I would certainly agree

12

that there is a real risk of identity theft any time

13

there's a disclosure of a Social Security number,

14

particularly as here when it's linked directly with the

15

name.

16
17
18

QUESTION: So does it not necessarily follow that
every one of those releases causes an adverse effect?
MR. CAMPBELL: I don't think it is.

There could

19

be - there could be people who aren't bothered by that or

20

who don't share that fear.

21

QUESTION: Whether they're bothered about it or

22

not, they're - they have an increased risk, just if you

23

increase your risk of death, maybe they're not aware of

24

it, but it's still an adverse effect.

25

MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I do not contend that the

2

way for merely increased risk.

to the adverse effect here.

of harm that actualizes, and here it did actualize in his

5

real emotional distress about the disclosure.

6

I think that does go back

You do have to have some sort

QUESTION: Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it.

at greater risk than you were before.

10
11

You're

That's - that's

actual as can be.
MR. CAMPBELL: I can't support that

12

interpretation of the act, although candidly, it - it

13

probably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the - in

14

the run-of-the-mine case.

15

- if the disclosure itself is the adverse effect, what

16

happens is that the causation language in subsection

17

(g)(1)(D) becomes superfluous, and I am being careful to

18

the - the text here -

19

And the reason is this: If the

QUESTION: Well, it's superfluous with respect to

20

Social Security numbers, but the statute covers a whole

21

range of activities other than this particular case.

22

MR. CAMPBELL: Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I

23

- I - but I'm not sure - I - I don't think the answer is

24

that it would be just superfluous with respect to Social

Security numbers.

In every case, if the release of any

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

please the Court:

2

I'd like to begin by discussing the distinction

3

as we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual

4

damages.

5

indicate, the term adverse effect is not one that

6

originated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art.

7

The general judicial review provision of the

8

Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to

9

persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think

10

it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show

11

that he has suffered the type of harm that would

12

ordinarily be compensable in damages.

13

And as one of Justice Scalia's questions

Because the APA excludes money damages as an

14

available item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under

15

the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is

16

whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not

17

whether he has been harmed in the past.

18

hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an

19

ongoing or imminent program by which the Government

20

intended to release Social Security numbers, and a

21

particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that

22

my own Social Security number will be released in the near

23

future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself

24

to establish that that person was adversely affected or

25

aggrieved within the meaning of the act.

And if we had a

legal right to have information about him maintained

3

within the Government's files and he would also suffer at

4

least an increased risk of identity theft.

5

enough to get him into the - into court to seek

6

prospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief.

certainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would

8

ordinarily be compensable in damages.

9

That would be

But those

QUESTION: Well, but that - but that's not the

10

question.

11

enough to get him into court, which is what it is said

12

adverse effect does here, it is enough under the APA to

13

give him judgment.

It - it - the point is it's - it's not only

He wins.

14

MR. STEWART: He wins -

15

QUESTION: It - it is enough to give - to make

16

his claim a valid - a valid claim.

17

MR. STEWART: He - he wins but -

18

QUESTION: And the reason he can't get money

19

damages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely

20

affected.

21

damages are not available under the APA.

It has to do with simply the fact that money

22

MR. STEWART: But -

23

QUESTION: But he wins under the APA.

24

MR. STEWART: But the fact that a plaintiff can

25

win under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what

2

is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an

3

available item of relief, namely the view that agency

4

action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and

5

plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by

6

unlawful government conduct in the future should

7

ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that

8

that not take place.

9

entitled to receive money damages from the Government for

10

But plaintiffs are not ordinarily

wrongs committed against them.

11

QUESTION: And I take it you're - you're saying

12

here - and they're not here because there's a further

13

requirement of actual damage before they get money.

14

MR. STEWART: That - that's right.

15

QUESTION: Yeah.

16

MR. STEWART: That the damages provisions

17

restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person

18

entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to

19

recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who

20

has not only established a violation of law, but who has

21

established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory

22

relief.

23

QUESTION: Why - why did they put that phrase,

24

entitled to recovery, in there in addition to actual

25

damages?

I'll be candid with you that I - I was thinking

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that maybe they put it in there because they anticipated

2

this - this category of cases like emotional damage

3

without physical manifestations is non-compensable, and

4

that - and that they were trying to leave open that kind

5

of a condition.

6

MR. STEWART: One - one hypothesis as to why the

7

phrase may appear as it does.

8

the Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate

9

version said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an

The phrase originated in

10

intentional or willful violation can collect actual or

11

general damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall

12

receive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of

13

that provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery,

14

could be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either

15

actual or general damages.

16
17

QUESTION: Well, he is entitled to recover actual
damages if he has any.

18

QUESTION: Yeah.

19

MR. STEWART: But that -

20

QUESTION: And he's entitled to recover it if he

21

doesn't have any.

22

has some or whether he doesn't have some.

23

don't understand, you say the most natural meaning of a

24

person entitled to recovery is a person entitled to

25

recovery who actually has actual damages.

He's entitled to recover it, whether he
So I will - I

That isn't how

1
2

I'd normally read it.

I'd - I'd read it somebody who's -

who's entitled to get it if he has it.

3

QUESTION: Well, I guess that's the issue.

4

QUESTION: Yeah, that is the issue.

5

So I just

want you to explain a little bit more -

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think -

8

QUESTION: - about why that's the most natural

9
10

reading.
MR. STEWART: I mean, the more - I think the more

11

natural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is

12

someone who not only has established some of the

13

prerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory

14

award, but who has established all of them.

15

only compensatory relief available is actual damages, then

16

a person who hasn't established actual damages is not

17

entitled to recovery.

18

And if the

But even if a plausible argument could be made

19

the other way, then the canon of construction that waivers

20

of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would

21

compel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way.

22

QUESTION: Well, plus - plus the canon that -

23

that you don't give words a meaning that renders them

24

totally superfluous.

25

MR. STEWART: That - that's -

QUESTION: And if it means what Justice Breyer

2

suggests, you can just leave out the words, a person

entitled to recovery.

4

MR. STEWART: Or - or -

5

QUESTION: Just read it, but in no case shall he

6

receive less than the sum of 10,000, of $1,000.

7

MR. STEWART: That's correct.

If - if Congress

8

had intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse

9

effect from a willful or intentional violation would

10

automatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used

11

the word person or individual or complainant, which was -

12

which were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the

13

Privacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had

14

arguably been violated.

15
16

QUESTION: Or just - just drop entitled to
recovery.

17

MR. STEWART: Exactly.

18

QUESTION: Shall a person receive less than the

19
20
21
22

sum of MR. STEWART: And the other point I would - we
would make in following up on one of Justice QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, if - and before going to

23

the words of the statute, this - there are any number of

24

statutes that have actual damages and it can say, or the

25

statutory damages, and some of them have this formula,

actual damages and person entitled to recover, and then

2

there's shades in between.

3

that Congress, by using those different formulas, meant a

4

different result in what would seem to be cases that don't

5

- are not sensibly distinguished?

6

Do you - do you really think

MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think we have

7

to infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant

8

something by the choice of words that it used.

9

phrase entitled to recovery is -

And the

10

QUESTION: A benign fiction, right?

11

MR. STEWART: A benign fiction, that's right.

And I think it is also the case that the phrase, person

14

States Code.

3

Now, how do - what they - what your opponents

4

say is that is a made-up problem.

5

going to happen, and the reason it isn't going to happen

is because these words, intentional or willful, are not

used, the word intentional, as it normally is.

argued, I don't know how to deal with it, but it seems

12

relevant to the underlying question that is moving me

13

about what Congress intended.

14

MR. STEWART: The petitioner is correct that the

15

phrase intentional or willful has been construed by the

16

lower courts essentially as a term of art, and the

17

prevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency

18

exhibited flagrant disregard for -

19

QUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry.

The lower court thing

20

that we've looked up uses an or about that, and one of the

21

parts of the or is without grounds for believing the

22

action to be lawful, which means that part of the test,

23

that if we have an ALJ, or we have people in the agency,

24

just never think about it, as they might not in this case,

25

that that cover - is covered by intentional or lawful.

QUESTION: I have three of them like that.

9

MR. STEWART: Right.

I - I think what the courts

10

are getting at is something at least akin to the standard

11

that would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual

12

Federal officer was sued, where the question would be,

13

could a reasonable officer in this person's position have

14

believed that what he was doing was legal?

15

courts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly

16

more deferential to the Government.

17

Probably the

In - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the

18

Government has to have been shown either to have

19

intentionally violated the law or to have intentionally

20

sought to bring about harm to the plaintiff.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION: Do we have to decide that in this
case?
MR. STEWART: No, no, I don't think you need to
decide that.
QUESTION: I'd like a lot more argument on it

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

before I decide that question.

2

MR. STEWART: That - that's correct.

3

QUESTION: Why -

4

QUESTION: And some briefing on it.

5

MR. STEWART: As the case comes to this Court,

6

both parties are in agreement, or neither party contests

7

the proposition that an intentional or willful violation

8

was established.

9

QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, what has happened in the

10

28-some years that this has been in effect concerning the

11

amount of recoveries against the Government?

12

MR. STEWART: I - I would candidly acknowledge we

13

have not had a problem with enormous recoveries against

14

the Government up to this point.

15

QUESTION: What happened in the 1990 lawsuit you

16

refer to on mailing of IRS farm - form 1040s, that had a

17

Social Security number and the name.

18

MR. STEWART: That - that was -

19

QUESTION: What happened to that case?

20

MR. STEWART: That was ultimately dismissed on

21

the ground that the Social Security numbers were not

22

records, which is contrary to the general course of the

23

law, which is that Social Security numbers would be - be

24

records.

25

are not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably

I - I want to be careful about this because we

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

follow from a loss in this case.

2

if we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is

3

given the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in

4

the APA, the Government would be subject to enormous

5

potential liability.

6

What we are saying is,

To take an example, following up on one of

7

Justice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the

8

Privacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful

9

disclosures.

It contains a range of other provisions that

10

could be best be described as technical or even

11

bureaucratic.

12

Government collects information from private individuals,

13

it has to identify, among other things, the source of

14

authority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive

15

order that authorizes the information to be collected.

16

One, for instance, is that when the

And if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and

17

left off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA

18

standards, any person who returned information on that

19

form would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he

20

would have been deprived of -

21

QUESTION: Yeah, but that won't hurt you if - if,

22

in fact, to show liability here, you have to show that the

23

agency officials who made up that form knew - let's make

24

it really tough - knew that leaving it off was command -

25

putting it on was commanded by the act and they say, ha ha

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ha, I know it's commanded by the act, but I'm not going to

2

do it.

3

MR. STEWART: I mean -

4

QUESTION: Now, that'll be pretty rare and the -

5

MR. STEWART: It would be rare.

6

QUESTION: So the -

7

MR. STEWART: Well, you could - you could imagine

8

a situation, and we wouldn't condone this - this conduct,

9

but you can imagine a situation in which an agency

10

official gets back the 100,000 forms from the printer and

11

says, oh my gosh, the U.S. Code cite was left off, but

12

then decides, I know we're supposed to do this, but I'm

13

not going to reprint 100,000 forms for something like

14

that, let's circulate them.

15

behavior.

16

to imagine that Congress would have intended that

17

everybody who fills out information on those forms would

18

then be entitled to $1,000.

19
20
21

We don't condone that

It would be a violation of law, but it's hard

QUESTION: Just to try to get this issue out of
the case, are you content to have us decide this case on on the assumption, just for the sake of argument but

22

without ruling, that - that the act requires willfulness

23

in the - in the most extreme sense that Justice Breyer

24

describes?

25

that assumption?

Are you willing to have us decide the case on

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STEWART: Yes.

2

QUESTION: You're willing to have us decide what

3

was not - what it was over, that there is an adverse

4

effect?

5

that, didn't dispute adverse effect, did it?

6

In fact, the - the Government didn't dispute

MR. STEWART: Not - not as to Buck Doe.

The -

7

the magistrate judge held that each of the plaintiffs had

8

established an adverse effect simply by release of the

9

Social Security numbers, and the district court didn't

10
11

expressly endorse that view, but didn't reject it either.
QUESTION: Is it your - is it your argument - and

12

I'm glad we're back to the statute - that in order to

13

determine in this case, in this case, whether there was a

14

cause of action, you had to read beyond the adverse effect

15

clause and go down to for - or before - and decide also

16

whether there was actual damages, before there was a cause

17

of action?

18

MR. STEWART: You - you wouldn't have to decide

19

whether there was proof of actual damages, but yes, I

20

think if it was apparent on the complaint that there was

21

an adverse effect but no possibility of proving actual

22

damages, then the suit shouldn't be - shouldn't go

23

forward, but -

24
25

QUESTION: That - that's an - that's an unusual
way to write the statute.

It's unusual to - to write the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute in a way where I don't know if I have a cause of

2

action until I get down to where the damages are defined.

3
4

MR. STEWART: I - I agree, but I think it would
be -

5

QUESTION: Usually I would say that any person

6

injured is the way we would expect this statute to have

7

been written.

8
9

MR. STEWART: I agree, and it may be that to Congress anticipated that questions concerning damages

10

would be resolved at the end of the day, and there would

11

obviously be a lot of cases in which a plaintiff would

12

allege damages at the outset, and therefore, would have a

13

cause of action, but if he failed to prove damages in the

14

- the course of the trial, he wouldn't be entitled to the

15

$1,000, even if he proved that he suffered an adverse

16

effect from a willful or intentional violation.

17

QUESTION: But Mr. Stewart, I - I take it that

18

even - even if there was no indication of actual damage,

19

the - by - by pleading the violation of the statute, he

20

would at least have pleaded enough to entitle him to - to

21

ask for a - to ask for equitable relief.

22

MR. STEWART: We would say that equitable relief

23

is not, in this context, is not specifically authorized by

24

the Privacy Act.

25

would be available under the APA, and the allegation would

But we would say that equitable relief

39

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be that the -

2

QUESTION: Okay.

3

MR. STEWART: - agency's action was not in

4

accordance with law -

5

QUESTION: I - I see.

6

MR. STEWART: - because it violated the Privacy

7

Act.

8

QUESTION: May -

9

MR. STEWART: So - so - and indeed, this suit at

10

the outset included a request for injunctive relief

11

against further disclosures, and the Government settled

12

that part of the case with lightning speed.

13

the - the plaintiff did obtain a judicial order directing

14

the Government not to continue with its practice.

15

There was -

QUESTION: So indeed there's - there - there's

16

nothing bizarre about letting him get into court just on

17

the basis of - of an adverse effect, because he can win in

18

court on the basis of an adverse effect, not by reason of

19

this act alone, but by reason of the obligations under

20

this Act plus the APA.

21

MR. STEWART: That's correct.

22

QUESTION: Right.

23

QUESTION: May I - may I go to another issue?

I

24

mean, one of things that's bothering us is several issues

25

that seem crucial, which we're just having to make

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

assumptions about here, and depending on the assumptions,

2

the scope of liability may - may be enormous.

3

Here's the one that is bothering me.

The - the

4

Government is not contesting here that in fact there -

5

there was some kind of actual damage, even though it was

6

not quantified.

7

MR. STEWART: No, I think we are contesting that.

8

QUESTION: Well, I - but - but you're not

9

contesting the fact - let me put it - I - I misspoke -

10

you're not contesting the fact that if he showed emotional

11

damage and emotional damage alone, no physical effects,

12

that that would be enough for recovery if - if a fact-

13

finder said, well, I think the emotional damage is worth

14

$250 -

15
16

MR. STEWART: No, no.

We - we are contesting

that and -

17

QUESTION: You are contesting that?

18

MR. STEWART: It hasn't really been -

19

QUESTION: Are - may - may I ask you just a

20

further question, then you can tell me which - whatever

21

you want.

22

sufficiency of this plaintiff's testimony to at least get

23

to the fact-finder on whether there was actual damage?

24

testified - I forget his exact words - but he testified,

25

you know, I was so upset when I heard that they had

Are you contesting as a matter of law the

He

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

released my Social Security number, I just didn't know

2

what to do or what to say, something like that.

3

contesting the sufficiency of that evidence to put an

4

issue of actual damage to the fact-finder?

5

Are you

MR. STEWART: Yes, and let me backtrack for a

6

second to say that the Fourth Circuit decided that Mr. Doe

7

had not proved actual damages, and the petitioner did not

8

seek this Court's review of that holding, so -

9
10

QUESTION: But they said he didn't prove actual
damages because there was no physical effect.

11

MR. STEWART: That - that's right.

12

QUESTION: They didn't say that, as a matter of

There was -

13

law, if you don't have the emotional physical effect rule,

14

he wouldn't have had enough to - to get to the fact-finder

15

an actual damage.

16

MR. STEWART: That - that's correct.

My - my

17

only point was, the reason we haven't briefed the question

18

of whether there were in fact actual damages is that our

19

understanding is that, because petitioner didn't seek this

20

Court's review of that aspect of the - the court of

21

appeals' holding, as the case comes to the Court, we're

22

assuming that there were no actual damages.

23

QUESTION: And you didn't - you didn't cross?

24

MR. STEWART: But - but to answer your - your

25

question about what the Government's position on the law

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is, our - our first argument is that in the context of

2

this specific statute, the phrase actual damages refers

3

only to pecuniary harm, and we've cited in a footnote a

4

conflict among the circuits with respect to that question,

5

and that - that isn't presented by this case.

6

QUESTION: Okay.

7

MR. STEWART:

8

QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a question

9

with respect to that?

But we would -

Suppose this Doe said, I'm very

10

concerned about the impact of this on my credit rating, so

11

I'm going to spend $10 to a credit - credit reporting

12

company to find out whether there's been any theft of my

13

identity, $10.

14

statute for actual damages?

15

Would there then be a claim under this

MR. STEWART: I mean, there - there would be a

16

question of whether that was - whether there was

17

causation, whether that was a reasonable response to the

18

threat, but in theory, an expense like that could qualify

19

as pecuniary harm and, thus, is actual damages.

20

QUESTION: But it made - it made me think that if

21

there's ambiguity in this statute, that wouldn't have made

22

much sense for Congress to write a statute like this

23

where, to meet the actual damage requirement, all you have

24

to do is make a $10 expense.

25

MR. STEWART: I mean, I agree that it's a

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

somewhat anomalous result that the availability of the

2

thousand can turn on a relatively small pecuniary loss.

3

It's - it's somewhat analogous at least to the common law

4

rule that punitive damages are available only to a

5

plaintiff who's shown some level of compensatory damages,

6

and there also a plaintiff might be able to contrive a

7

small loss that is compensable, and thereby make himself

8

eligible for punitive damages that far exceed the amount

9

of -

10

QUESTION: But it's not just not contrived,

11

because now it's a formula for - for all the people who

12

have this kind of complaint, so I think if that's what -

13

what the line is, then Mr. Doe, is it, all the future Mr.

14

Does will ask to have their credit checked.

15

MR. STEWART: I mean, we would still want to - we

16

would still have to know whether that was in fact a

17

reasonable response to what the Government had did - done

18

- and what the - the threat that it posed to the - the

19

plaintiff.

20

possible in in one category of cases, it would still not

21

be possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of

22

Privacy Act violations.

23

And even if that kind of machination might be

To continue with my answer to Justice Souter's

24

question, the - the second thing we would say about the

25

emotional injury is that, even if some emotional harms

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were compensable as actual damages under the statute, we

2

don't think that the particular emotional harm alleged

3

here would be, because a Social Security number, unlike,

4

for instance, intimate details about a person's family

5

life, is not inherently private or secret or confidential.

6

It's not the sort of information that would cause a person

7

to say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else

8

knew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't

9

going to misuse it against me.

10

The - the reason that people are worried about

11

release of Social Security numbers is that that release

12

may lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify

13

theft or -

14

QUESTION: So you're saying as a matter of law,

15

this is just what he testified to is simply too de minimis

16

to be considered evidence -

17

MR. STEWART: That -

18

QUESTION: - sufficient evidence.

19

MR. STEWART: That's correct.

And we've cited

20

the Metro-North case in our brief, and I think that the

21

harm - the emotional harm that he's alleged is really -

22

really very similar to the fear of cancer as a result of

23

asbestos exposure that was held not to be compensable in

24

the absence of some current physical impairment.

25

So to - to - follow up on this and make our

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

position absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term

2

adverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every

3

plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful

4

or intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the

5

potential financial consequences would be enormous.

6

I would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's

7

quite possible that the Government would argue in the

8

lower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the

9

phrase adverse effect should be given a narrower

10

construction under this statute than under the APA.

11

our basic point is -

12

Now,

But

QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to the parade

13

of horribles that we're confronted with, is I - it's my

14

understanding that there are several other statutes under

15

entirely different statutes, they have the similar

16

provision but they're clearly worded in a way that says,

17

if you get anything, you'll get the minimum, and - but

18

it's the position that your opponent contends is the

19

proper reading of that statute.

20

statutes, am I -

There are several such

21

MR. STEWART: There are a lot of statutes with

22

wording, for instance, to the effect of a plaintiff who

23

establishes a violation will receive actual damages or

24

$1,000, whichever is greater.

25

to suits against the United States -

Most of those don't apply

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: And - and -

2

MR. STEWART: - but there are many such laws.

3

QUESTION: And most of those would not require

4
5

proof of actual damages?
MR. STEWART: That's correct.

Under the plain

6

terms of the statute, the plaintiff would get the 1,000 -

7

QUESTION: Why in your view did Congress come up

8

with a different formula in this case than it has in that

9

- in the pattern of statutes that those represent?

10

MR. STEWART: I'm - part of it may be that most

11

of those statutes are not dealing with suits against the

12

United States, and Congress may be more protective of the

13

public fisc, and part of it is the - the legislative

14

debates reveal that Congress considered a variety of

15

potential damages provisions, some of which were more

16

generous than the one that was ultimately enacted, some of

17

them less generous.

18

provisions -

For instance, the more generous

19

QUESTION: But this statute is unique, is it not?

20

MR. STEWART: It's not quite unique.

I believe

21

there are a couple of other provisions that use the

22

phrase, person entitled to recovery, and that phrase has

23

not been authoritatively construed by this Court, so those

24

- interpretation of those statutes would raise the same

25

question this one does.

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION: But there's a number of them that
start out with actual damages.

3

MR. STEWART: And - and sometimes, again, the

4

words are to the effect of actual damages or $1,000,

5

whichever is greater.

6

$1,000 is not limited to a, quote, person entitled to

7

recovery, unquote, the plain language of many of those

8

statutes compels the conclusion that $1,000 will be

9

awardable regardless of actual damages.

10

And because the availability of the

QUESTION: Now, there was an interpretation -

11

Congress told OMB to do interpretive guides, and it did,

12

and it - and it gave it the meaning that this plaintiff

13

gives it.

14

that what OMB said?

15

It's - it read the statute - didn't - wasn't
Wasn't that their contemporaneous -

MR. STEWART: I mean, I think the more - I think

16

you're right that the more natural reading - the OMB

17

guideline didn't address in terms the situation where a

18

plaintiff shows no actual damages but nevertheless claims

19

the thousand, but the OMB guideline did say, a person who

20

suffers an adverse effect from a willful or an intention

21

violation shall receive a 1,000 - actual damages or

22

$1,000, whichever is greater.

23

QUESTION: It said actual damages or 1,000.

As I

24

understood the - that original interpretation, it was the

25

reading that the plaintiff is putting forward here and

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

your response to it in your brief seemed to be that was a

2

wrong interpretation because it didn't take account of

3

sovereign immunity or saving the sovereign fisc and an

4

official at OMB said it was wrong and it's not - no longer

5

effective.

6

MR. STEWART: I mean, I think if - if plaintiffs

7

are using the OMB interpretation to establish the point

8

that intelligent people can read the statute the way that

9

they did, I - I think it's validly used for that purpose.

10

But the OMB guideline is not entitled to deference, as the

11

Court held in Adams Fruit, a statutory provision that is

12

to administered solely by the courts is not one as to

13

which the Court will defer to administrative

14

interpretations.

15
16
17
18

The - the OMB -

QUESTION: But didn't - didn't Congress designate
OMB to - to these guides?
MR. STEWART: Congress designated OMB, but it's the particular provision that is at - specifically at

19

issue is reprinted at page 13a to the appendix to the

20

Government's brief.

21

Office of Management and Budget shall develop and, after

22

notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe

23

guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in

24

implementing the provisions of this section.

25

And it says, the director of the

So the only specific directive that OMB had was

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive

2

obligations under the act.

3

that, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further

4

and offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences

5

would follow if they breached their substantive

6

obligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically

7

entrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any

8

basis for inferring that Congress -

9
10
11

QUESTION: I see.

Now, in the course of doing

You're - you're saying that -

that it - it was meant just to tell the agencies what you
have to do to comply with the act.

12

MR. STEWART: Exactly.

13

QUESTION: Yeah, that - that's probably the best

14

reading of it.

15

MR. STEWART: Exactly.

16

QUESTION: Yeah.

17

MR. STEWART: So the - the last - the last point

18

I wanted to make is, it might be possible, if - if we lost

19

this case, it might be possible to mitigate the financial

20

consequences to the Government by giving the term adverse

21

effect a narrow construction, but our - our view is, if

22

the consequence of adopting plaintiff's reading of the

23

phrase person entitled to recovery is that an established

24

term of art like adverse effect has to be construed in

25

other than its normal manner in order to make the statute

make sense, there's something wrong with plaintiff's

2

reading.

3

QUESTION: But why - why do you say that?

4

Because, see, the adverse effect part governs people who

5

don't even want damages.

6

court, it's just to get into court, bring the suit, isn't

7

it?

I mean, it - it's to get into

8

MR. STEWART: Right.

9

QUESTION: So - so I would have thought that your

10

- your reaction - I just want you to clarify this - would

11

be, if they win this case, then the reaction would be to

12

go back and say, all right, if we're going to give $1,000

13

to people who really are just feeling bad about what

14

happened, we've got to give them all $1,000, well, it's

15

only in circumstances where the agency really did

16

something quite wrong.

17

intentional or willful requirement toughly, not - not the

18

adverse effect part tough.

19

that be the reaction?

20

And so you'll read that

I mean, why - why wouldn't

MR. STEWART: I mean, I guess if - if this - if

21

this Court held that the phrase intentional or willful was

22

limited to situations -

23

QUESTION: I don't see - yeah?

24

MR. STEWART: If it - if it was limited to

25

situations in which the Government set out to violate an

1

individual's rights under the Privacy Act, that - that

2

would be another way at least of -

3

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, and then you'd say, well,

4

we should assume that's what happened here, though.

5

certainly didn't -

6

MR. STEWART: I - I mean -

7

QUESTION:

- but we should assume that.

It

Now,

8

suppose I assume that, and then I decide that they're

9

right on the basis of that assumption, and then in the

10

next case it turns out my assumption happened to be quite

11

wrong because Congress had a broad intent there.

12

happens?

13

Now what

MR. STEWART: I mean, even under the narrowest

14

possible interpretation of what intentional or willful

15

means, you could have hypotheticals like the one with the

16

form that left off the U.S.C. cite, and again, we - we

17

hope those things would happen very rarely, but it seems

18

highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted each of

19

the hundred thousand people who put on - information on

20

the form to get $1,000.

Thank you.

21

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

22

Mr. Campbell, you have five minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

25

MR. CAMPBELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Justice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first

2

point to you, because I - I think you put your finger on

3

one of the number of - of absurd results, or difficult-

4

to-swallow results that flow from accepting the

5

Government's interpretation.

6

contention here is that quantification of actual damages

7

is an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy,

8

what a strange way to write the statute if that's what

9

Congress intended.

10

The Government's essential

The - the relative language is reproduced at

11

pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that

12

whenever an agency fails to comply with any other

13

provision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in

14

such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,

15

the individual may bring a civil action against the

16

agency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there.

17

go to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse

18

effect was the result of an intentional or willful

19

violation, then the Government, the United States shall be

20

liable, in the sum - in an amount equal to the sum of.

21

You then

All that is left at that point is

plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an

4

intentional or willful violation of the act.

5

And, in fact, that would never be

Costs are always available to a Privacy Act

So there are certainly going to be at least some

6

recovery.

7

with reasonableness of precondition of actual damages.

8

some - there is going to be a recovery in those cases.

9

Now, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a

10

very - it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two,

11

a statute that arguably is unconstitutional.

12

don't need to read it that way, because the natural

13

reading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes,

14

Congress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy

15

invasions very typically result in emotional harms that

16

inherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't

17

intend, I can't imagine, to - to make the line of recovery

18

turn on whether you can prove that you put 37 - a 37-cent

19

stamp on an - on an envelope to get your credit report or

20

pay the $10 fee.

21

Congress be solicitous of people who suffer the same harm

22

- be solicitous of the one who put a stamp on an envelope?

23

That's a nonsensical.

There's no qualification of the costs award
So

But you

That's a very arbitrary line.

Why would

24

Moreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that

25

are realized under the act as Congress intended by saying,

look, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof

don't go through that.

let's not go through the proof.

If you have an emotional distress and it's
