CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Ms. Zinn.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN F. ZINN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. ZINN:
it please the Court:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Sovereign immunity should not bar enforcement of
the consent decree in this case for two reasons.

12

First, when State officials ask a district court

13

to enter a consent decree, they submit their rights

14

concerning the decree for judicial determination, thereby

15

waiving any possible claim for objection on the basis of

16

immunity.

17

Second, the decree in this case provides

18

prospective relief to protect the supremacy of Federal

19

law, exactly as envisioned by Ex Parte Young.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask on -- on the first point?

21

You say when State officials submit to -- to a decree.

22

It's -- it's immaterial, as far as you're concerned,

23

whether the State Attorney General defended the -- the

24

suit or represented these officials.

25

MS. ZINN:

Is that right?

No, it's not immaterial.

The --

Texas' Attorney General is authorized by the legislature

2

to represent the State and its employees --

3

QUESTION:

No.

I understand that, but suppose

he hadn't been and suppose it is just the State officials

5

who appeared in an Ex Parte Young suit.

6

they're sued.

7

any other participation by anybody else in the State, that

They're --

There's no other State official who takes
Nonetheless, they enter into a

Is it your submission that even without

10

consent decree binds not just them, but I gather you say

11

future officials in -- in their offices?

12

Right?

MS. ZINN:

Unrepresented by the State Attorney

14

QUESTION:

Unrepresented.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but wouldn't -- wouldn't there

13

General.
You would --

16

be a question of fact in that case?

17

odd, I -- I would suppose not to have the State Attorney

18

General there, and -- and wouldn't the -- if I were a

19

trial judge, I'd say, well, is this the State that is

20

submitting this -- this settlement?

21

wouldn't there be, theoretically at least, a fact question

22

in Justice Scalia's circumstances?

23

MS. ZINN:

I mean, it would be

I mean, wouldn't --

Fact and a matter of law, Your Honor.

24

The question under this Court's decision recently in

25

Lapides would be whether those officials are authorized to

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

represent the State in court, even absent their attorney.

2

That would be so unusual in Texas I can't imagine it even

3

happening, but --

4

QUESTION:

No, but that -- but that's a waiver

5

theory.

6

you -- you need the State there.

7

I mean, if you're proceeding on a waiver theory,

But let's assume you're not proceeding on the

8

waiver theory.

9

if you have authority to enter the decree, you have

You have the second ground, which is just

10

authority to enforce the decree.

11

argument, does it make any difference to you whether the

12

State Attorney General is there or whether these officials

13

have the power to represent the State?

14

MS. ZINN:

Now, for purpose of that

Under our second argument, our

15

position is that since the decree is a remedy ordered in a

16

valid Ex Parte Young case, it provides prospective relief

17

only from alleged ongoing violations of Federal law.

18

-- the remedy is proper.

19
20
21
22
23

QUESTION:

The

And therefore it's consistent with

the Eleventh Amendment without any waiver.
MS. ZINN:

Correct.

The Eleventh Amendment is

not engaged for that -- for that -QUESTION:

Can you tell us how it worked?

The

24

representative of the Attorney General was in court and he

25

stands up and he says, we insist on sovereign immunity,

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the judge say, all right, that's act one.

It's

2

closed.

3

say, well, now we're here on the Eleventh Amendment?

4

mean, how -- how did this work?

And then did the same officials stay and they

And --

5

MS. ZINN:

In -- in this case --

6

QUESTION:

And let -- let me just say also

7

there's no excerpt of record or docket entry.

8

thing I have is the consent decree.

9

saying the consent decree dated so and so is hereby
entered as the judgment of the court?

11

that anywhere?
MS. ZINN:

The only

Was there any order

10

12

I

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, can I find

The -- the lodging

13

has the -- as its last page, the order to correct the

14

consent decree which states that the -- the order was --

15

the unopposed motion to -- to correct the consent decree

16

has merit and should be granted.

17

as the court's order in February of 1996.

The decree was entered

18

QUESTION:

And --

19

QUESTION:

There was no separate order.

20

just this consent decree that's in the lodging.

21

MS. ZINN:

That's correct.

22

QUESTION:

-- that's it.

23

MS. ZINN:

That's correct.

24

QUESTION:

Okay.

25

It was

That's --

Now maybe we can go back and

you can tell me who the -- was there an act one and an act

two, act one being the State asserts immunity, act two

2

being the Eleventh Amendment, or -- or were the same

3

parties before the court at all times?

4

MS. ZINN:

The same parties --

5

QUESTION:

Wearing different -- wearing

6

different hats or proceeding under some different theory.

7

MS. ZINN:

The same parties were before the

8

Court for the entire case with the exception of two State

9

agencies which were dismissed early on.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

QUESTION:

That's the puzzle in this case.

The

12

State as State was dismissed at the threshold, and then we

13

have an Ex Parte Young case.

14

Eleventh Amendment immunity again.

15

the case.

16

did it then become converted back into a case against the

17

State so that we're talking about whether the State waived

18

its immunity?

19

And now we're talking about
So the State is out of

It's proceeding as an Ex Parte Young case.

MS. ZINN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

How

Our position,

20

as well recognized apparently, is that this is an Ex Parte

21

Young case.

22

briefing have urged that that is not correct and that this

23

-- this, at least in part, is not a valid order under Ex

24

Parte Young.

25

However, the State officials in their

QUESTION:

The State, if -- if I remember

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

correctly, came before the judge and urged the approval of

2

this consent decree.

3

MS. ZINN:

Correct.

4

QUESTION:

Did it not?

And there were -- there

5

were several representatives of the State who so

6

testified.

7

MS. ZINN:

Correct, and they were unanimous.

8

The -- all of the State officials and their lawyer were

9

unanimous in requesting the district court to enter the

10
11
12

consent decree.
QUESTION:

That -- that's your waiver.

That's

the waiver side of your argument.

13

MS. ZINN:

Correct.

14

QUESTION:

I frankly am reluctant to -- to

15

decide the case on that ground if another ground is

16

available simply because that would require a case-by-case

17

investigation as to -- to what extent the participation by

18

-- by other State officials existed, whether they were

19

authorized to participate and so forth and so on.

20

Whereas, your other ground doesn't require that -- that

21

case-by-case investigation, and wouldn't that be a -- a

22

much clearer line to -- to establish?

23
24
25

MS. ZINN:

In our -- in our view both positions

are clear in this case.
QUESTION:

The -- the --

You have to make sure that the State

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Attorney General was authorized to represent the State in

2

this case or whatever other official you say committed the

3

waiver.

4

investigation in every case, wouldn't it?

5
6

That would -- that would be a factual

MS. ZINN:

No.

be a question of law.

7

QUESTION:

In Lapides, it appeared to -- to

The issue --

No, but Justice Scalia's question

8

didn't go to waiver.

9

Lapides says, if you can represent, you can waive.

It went to representation.

And
But

10

there would be a question of representation, wouldn't

11

there?

12

MS. ZINN:

But in Lapides, it appeared to me

13

that that was resolved fairly simply based on the

14

application of Federal law to the State --

15

QUESTION:

16

he could represent.

17

MS. ZINN:

Once -- once it was understood that

Yes, which was determined by an

18

examination of the State statutes involved.

19

law on that point is almost word for word the same as the

20

-- the Georgia constitutional provisions --

21

QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

Easy.

And the Texas

I mean, I'm -- I'm

22

not saying that this would be a difficult case, but you

23

would have to, I suppose, make that inquiry.

24

MS. ZINN:

But --

25

QUESTION:

This case might not be difficult, but

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I -- I don't like going rummaging around in State law.

2

find Federal law hard enough.

I

3

(Laughter.)

4

MS. ZINN:

I do too, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Ms. Zinn, I thought that you said in

6

response to my question that this -- this waiver -- that's

7

not your preferred ground.

8

because the State insisted that this was Eleventh

9

Amendment and it wasn't waived.

You said you're arguing it

But your -- you brought

10

an Ex Parte Young suit.

11

that heading, and -- and that argument, if it prevails,

12

would be -- one would not need to reach the question of

13

the Eleventh Amendment in the --.

14

MS. ZINN:

You've got a consent decree under

That's correct.

The -- one way to

15

look at this is that given the Texas Attorney General's

16

argument that this is not an Ex Parte Young case, not a

17

valid order under Ex Parte Young, to the extent that the

18

Court agrees with that, those points have been waived

19

because by asking the district court to enter the consent

20

decree, the State officials submitted their rights

21

concerning the decree for judicial determination.

22

doing that --

23

QUESTION:

Let's put -- put it this way.

And by

Are

24

you saying that if the State officials negotiate a consent

25

decree that goes beyond the Eleventh Amendment -- or that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

goes beyond -- pardon me -- that goes beyond Ex Parte

2

Young's --

3

MS. ZINN:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

-- rules, that then there must be a

6

MS. ZINN:

No.

7

QUESTION:

All right.

5

8

waiver?

How can they do that

without a waiver?

9

MS. ZINN:

Well --

10

QUESTION:

Especially if they've asserted their

11

immunity at the beginning.

12

MS. ZINN:

Because under this Court's

13

traditional rules concerning equitable decrees, even a

14

disputed injunction need not be specifically tied to the

15

provisions of law for the --

16

QUESTION:

So you want us to write an opinion

17

that says after the State has specifically asserted its

18

Eleventh Amendment immunity, its officials may negotiate a

19

consent decree which goes beyond the boundaries of

20

jurisdiction set forth in -- in Ex Parte Young without

21

waiver.

22

MS. ZINN:

The question of the scope of remedy

23

is a different question from the Eleventh Amendment/Ex

24

Parte Young question.

25

jurisdictional question, but the question of the scope of

The Ex Parte Young question is a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

2

proper remedy -QUESTION:

Well -- well, you introduced the

3

point of remedy.

4

my question was whether or not, having asserted the

5

immunity in a -- in -- under the assumption that the

6

immunity has not been waived, the State officials can

7

negotiate a consent decree that goes beyond the usual

8

rules of Ex Parte Young, it goes beyond the authority

9

granted to the courts under Ex Parte Young, without

10
11

That wasn't part of my question.

relying on the theory of waiver.
MS. ZINN:

For example, damages?

12

within your hypothetical?

13

waiver, no.

14

My --

QUESTION:

Would that fit

Because in that case without

You -- you really can't tell until

15

the decree is entered whether or not it complies with Ex

16

Parte Young, I would think, because it isn't necessarily

17

fought out on the -- in the -- in the trial of the case

18

exactly what the remedy will be.

19

MS. ZINN:

The -- the validity of consent decree

20

should be -- as in an Ex Parte Young case, should be

21

measured under this -- this Court's decisions, for

22

example, in Milliken and Rufo.

23

remedy must tend to or to remedy the violation proven.

24

And Rufo says that when you have a consent decree, it may

25

aim even higher than that.

Milliken says that the

Because in the course of --

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But maybe -- maybe there should be a

2

special rule for Ex Parte Young cases.

3

case, going beyond the mere violation does not offend any

4

other provision of the Constitution, but the argument here

5

is, oh, once you go beyond holding the officer to

6

compliance with Federal law, once you go beyond that,

7

you're out of Ex Parte Young and you're moving against the

8

State and the Eleventh Amendment is a bar.

9

there's a special rule with regard to remediation in -- in

10

In the ordinary

So maybe

Ex Parte Young cases.

11

MS. ZINN:

Milliken involved a State official,

12

and it's one of the key cases about the scope of disputed

13

injunctions.

14

beyond the exact scope, the precise scope of the violation

15

at issue.

16

And it says that remedial orders may go

QUESTION:

Is this outside of Ex Parte Young?

17

-- I mean, the way I was thinking about it, which might

18

not be right, is that what you were saying in the second

19

part of your argument is that Ex Parte Young permits,

20

without the consent of a State, an individual to sue a

21

State official in his official capacity, asking for an

22

injunction on the ground that the official has violated

23

Federal law.

I

That's what Ex Parte Young says.

24

MS. ZINN:

Correct.

25

QUESTION:

And now you get that injunction, and

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that injunction contains provisions that aren't all about

2

Federal law.

3

And I thought perhaps the way to look at it was, and that

4

injunction does not violate the Eighth -- the Eleventh

5

Amendment.

6

it's all part of an effort to cure the Federal violation

7

with related matters thrown in.

Some of them are about related State law.

You don't need a State to give consent because

8

MS. ZINN:

Correct.

9

QUESTION:

Ex Parte Young authorizes such a

11

MS. ZINN:

Correct.

12

QUESTION:

Now, is that last statement right?

13

MS. ZINN:

Yes.

14

QUESTION:

So then it's not outside Ex Parte

10

thing.

15

Young.

16

Parte Young means.

You're giving us an interpretation of what Ex

17

MS. ZINN:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

And what is your authority for saying

19

that Ex Parte Young validates the going beyond the Federal

20

issues involved?

21

that authority for that?

22

You mentioned Milliken.

MS. ZINN:

Milliken.

Is that -- is

Hutto v. Finney would be

23

another example.

24

hope that the State officials will comply with its proper

25

remedial order.

A district court need not sit back and

It can enforce that order.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not talking so much about

2

enforcement as about entering it in the first place

3

consistently with Ex Parte Young.

4

MS. ZINN:

Well, this Court's decision in

5

Firefighters generally sets out standards for entry of a

6

consent decree, and a decree is properly entered, as this

7

one was found to be, if it furthers -- if it serves to

8

resolve a dispute within the court's subject matter

9

jurisdiction, which is the case here -- this is a Federal

10

question about the Medicaid Act -- if it is generally

11

within the scope of the pleadings, which is true in this

12

case, and if the remedy in the decree serves to further

13

the objectives of the -- in this case, the Medicaid Act,

14

which is true about all of the provisions of the decree in

15

this case.

16

QUESTION:

So you're really saying that it

17

doesn't go beyond Ex Parte Young.

18

premises of some of the arguments here that it does go

19

beyond it, in your judgment, is -- is in fact a false

20

premise.

21

MS. ZINN:

I mean, the -- the

That's correct.

Our position is that

22

the district court could have entered this -- this decree

23

as a disputed injunction if the State officials had not

24

decided to consent.

25

QUESTION:

Would you help -- excuse me.

May I

ask one more question?

3

Would you help me on one thing?

My

4

understanding was -- and I -- I may simply be wrong on

5

this.

6

beyond Young was not a claim that it -- it mandated State

7

law -- or mandated the performance of State law

8

obligations, but that it went further than it had to to

9

enjoin the Federal violation by getting into details about

My understanding was that the claim that this went

10

what the State officers had to do or had to refrain from

11

do -- from doing.

12

the claim is not that it got into State law but that it

13

simply went beyond the scope of a proper remedial order

14

under the Federal law?

15
16

Am I correct that it's -- it's not --

MS. ZINN:

Is that correct?

Well, I'd hate to put words into Mr.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

2
3

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

Enforcement of the decree in this case does not

5

violate the Eleventh Amendment for two reasons.

6

any Eleventh Amendment objection was waived, and second,

7

enforcement is permissible under Ex Parte Young.

8
9

First,

Now, the waiver issue arises in this case
because the State officials are arguing that the relief in

10

the consent decree that is directed to them violates the

11

Eleventh Amendment, and it is that Eleventh Amendment

12

objection that those same officials, together with the

13

Attorney General, waived when they asked the district

14

court to enter the very relief that they are now objecting

15

to on Eleventh Amendment grounds.

16

And the reason that there is waiver is that

17

under this Court's cases, when the Attorney General on the

18

-- of the State on behalf of the State invokes a Federal

19

court's jurisdiction, Eleventh Amendment immunity is

20

waived.

21

entered into a consent decree on behalf of State officials

22

in their official capacity and then asked the district

23

court to enter that decree, he clearly invoked that

24

court's jurisdiction and waived any Eleventh Amendment

25

objection to the entry of that judgment against those

Now, when the Attorney General in this case

State officials.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Attorney General had not

3

been involved and simply the State officials on their own

4

entered into this consent decree.

5

MR. GORNSTEIN:

First of all, you would have the

6

question of waiver, and that is answered by the inquiry

7

that Lapides and other waiver cases have -- have

8

instructed, which is do those -- are those officials

9

authorized by State law to conduct litigation on behalf of

10
11
12

the State.
QUESTION:

So that would be a factual inquiry in

every case whether the particular official --

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

14

it's a legal question --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I would say -- I would say

I understand.
-- that typically in almost

17

every State, Justice Scalia, it would be the Attorney

18

General who is authorized to represent the State in

19

litigation.

20
21

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Scalia can preserve his

own hypothetical.

22

MR. GORNSTEIN:

23

QUESTION:

Right.

But suppose that there was -- that

24

the officials did not have the authority to waive the

25

Eleventh Amendment, but they did enter into a consent

decree.

2

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Yes.

Then you get to the second

3

argument in this case which is an Ex Parte Young argument,

4

and the Ex Parte Young issue is that the consent decree in

5

this case is permissible under Ex Parte Young because it

6

provides prospective relief against State officials based

7

on the Federal Medicaid statute.

8

requirements of an Ex Parte Young suit, that it be --

9

QUESTION:

And those are the three

This -- this carries you so far

10

beyond the theory of Ex Parte Young, and the theory of Ex

11

Parte Young is you're not impinging upon State sovereign

12

immunity when you are simply requiring State officials to

13

adhere to State law.

14

they're -- when they're violating Federal law, and

15

therefore, you're not impinging upon the State's sovereign

16

immunity.

17

They are acting ultra vires when

But now with the theory that you're expounding,

18

you're not only holding them to compliance with Federal

19

law, but you're saying even when you're not acting ultra

20

vires, when you have a lot of perfectly legal options of

21

how to comply with Federal law, you will -- you will

22

choose this option.

23

impinging upon State sovereign immunity in -- in a way

24

that -- that the mere theory of Ex Parte Young does not

25

justify.

And that -- that is, it seems to me,

MR. GORNSTEIN:

In an Ex Parte Young action,

2

State officials like all other Federal litigants are free

3

to enter into consent decrees that go beyond what is

4

strictly required by Federal law on one or more issues

5

because there is a tradeoff.

6

no relief on other issues that they may care about.

7

this is a system that benefits Federal court litigants

8

generally, and it is also one that benefits the State and

9

its State officials.

question?

3

whether it involves schools, prisons, the Medicaid program

4

which the State Attorney General isn't there?

5

Do you know of any institutional decree,

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I don't know of any such case,

6

and as I was telling Justice Scalia before, all the

7

Court's waiver cases up until now have been ones in which

8

the Attorney General has represented the State and has

9

waived the -- has -- has been authorized by the State to

10
11

represent the State's interests in litigation.
QUESTION:

Might be improper for -- for the --

12

for the trial court to go beyond strict compliance with

13

Federal law, to -- to approve a consent decree that goes

14

beyond that without the presence of the -- I mean, maybe

15

waiver is a necessary concomitant of -- of the theory of

16

Ex Parte Young that you're giving us.

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, I don't think it -- it is a

18

necessary -- waiver is not a necessary concomitant because

19

it is a component of an Ex Parte Young case.

20

said, for example, in the Rufo case that State -- it had

21

no doubt that State and local officials, in order to

22

resolve litigation, could agree to relief that goes beyond

23

what's required by Federal law.

25

QUESTION:

This Court

Mr. Gornstein, I want to clarify what

you mean in your argument when you say go beyond.

There

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

are -- and here are two possibilities.

2

One, you throw in an entirely new obligation,

3

and you say, you know, by the way, we'll -- we'll also

4

agree to a program of pediatric podiatry, which isn't

5

covered by the statute.

6

you how good our faith is.

7

We'll do that too just to show

A second possibility is we'll show you how we

8

will implement our agreement to abide by what we

9

understand to be Federal law.

10

We will throw in a how-to-

do-it or a how-we-are-going-to-do-it clause.

11

I understand your argument, when you refer to

12

going beyond the letter of Federal law and agreeing to

13

that in a settlement, to refer to a how-to-do-it kind of

14

agreement as opposed to a new substantive obligation

15

agreement.

16
17

I assume.

Is that correct?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I guess my question is --

phrase, going beyond Ex Parte Young?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

22

24

Yes, but let -- let me explain

Have you ever --

No, I --

Has anybody seen a consent decree

that simply said, we'll obey the law?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I didn't say it went beyond

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Ex Parte Young.

I said it went beyond what was strictly

2

required by Federal law.

3

Rufo case, every Federal court remedial order that's

4

entered by a Federal court goes beyond what's strictly

5

required by Federal law.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

8
9

And as this Court said in the

That's all -And Milliken permits that as

long as it's aimed at remedying a violation.
But there's one step beyond Milliken here, and

10

that Rufo says that you can even agree to relief that goes

11

beyond what a court would order after a trial as long as

12

the relief furthers the objectives of the underlying law

13

because there you are operating with the consent of the

14

State officials in -- in selecting that relief.

15

QUESTION:

You should have given a different

16

answer to Justice Souter then because certainly pediatric

17

podiatry would further the objectives of the law to

18

provide the medical care to -- to children.

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, at some point it has to

20

resolve a bona fide dispute within the subject matter

21

jurisdiction of the court as well, and if there's no

22

arguable violation of Federal law that the relief relates

23

to, then it falls outside of what a court should enter as

24

a decree under Rufo.

25

QUESTION:

Well, you really haven't saved us a

whole lot of trouble then.

2

one of the attractive features of your position was that

3

once you have an order, that's the end of it.

4

have to try the order when -- when you seek enforcement to

5

parse out which parts of it go too far and which parts

6

don't go too far.

7

can go too far.

8

pediatric podiatry or -- or not.

9

I -- I frankly thought that

You don't

You tell me there are some -- some that

We have to look to whether this is

MR. GORNSTEIN:

In general, once a decree has

10

been entered, there's no objection that can be made at the

11

enforcement stage other than subject matter jurisdiction.

12

But subject matter jurisdiction would include an inquiry

13

into whether what was at issue in the case was -- if it

14

was an arguable Federal claim or sought to further the

15

objectives underlying an arguable Federal claim.

16

going to be rare that it won't do that, but if it doesn't

17

do that, the State has a right to object to that on

18

subject matter jurisdiction grounds.

That's

19

By the way, the State also has the right always

20

to move for modification of provisions under this Court's

21

decision in Rufo that are not arguably related to -- that

22

are not related to any arguable violation of Federal law.

23

If it's just a frivolous underpinning to the suit, the --

24

the State could always move for modification and get that

25

provision eliminated under Rufo.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. EDWARD CRUZ

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14
15

MR. CRUZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

16

This case presents the basic question whether

17

Federal district courts are immune from the strictures of

18

sovereign immunity and Ex Parte Young when administering

19

Federal consent decrees.

20

In this case, it is clear what Federal law

21

requires.

22

everything that Federal law requires, the State of Texas

23

is doing.

24
25

The Medicaid statute is very clear and

The dispute that the parties are having here is
not simply a theoretical dispute about whether -- what

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

degree of connection there should be between a remedy and

2

-- and an ongoing violation of Federal law.

3

violation of Federal law, and that fundamentally is the

4

problem.

5

QUESTION:

There is no

But can I ask you this question?

6

say there's no violation of Federal law now.

7

mean there was no violation of Federal law when the

8

lawsuit began?

9

MR. CRUZ:

10

no court has determined that.

11

QUESTION:

You

Does that

It does not necessarily mean that and

No, but isn't it -- isn't the -- in

12

order to determine the court's power to act, don't you

13

have to look at the facts at the time litigation started?

14

MR. CRUZ:

Well, under Ex Parte Young, the

15

question is not retrospectively was there a violation of

16

Federal law, but -- but --

17

QUESTION:

No.

I understand that, but still it

18

seems to me your -- your jurisdictional inquiry would

19

focus on the situation at the time the litigation

20

commenced.

21

MR. CRUZ:

There is a strong argument that there

22

was not a violation of Federal law at the time the

23

litigation commenced, but that matter was never

24

adjudicated one way or the other.

25

QUESTION:

That's right because the State, in

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

effect, waived its right to adjudicate that.
MR. CRUZ:

What the State did is pursue an

3

option to settle the -- the matter and avoid an

4

adjudication.

5

QUESTION:

But doesn't that mean there was at

6

least a potential violation of law that would give the

7

court jurisdiction to enter a remedy, which might go

8

beyond merely saying, don't violate the law in the future,

9

that because you may have violated the law in the past, I

10

have the power to order you to do some things that may not

11

in themselves be illegal?

12

MR. CRUZ:

We would agree that this case was

13

initially properly brought under Ex Parte Young in that

14

the complaint, under the terms of the Verizon decision,

15

alleged a violation of Federal law.

16

Young is not simply a formulistic pleading requirement.

17

It also is -- is, under this Court's decision in, among

18

other things, Green v. Mansour, a restriction on the

19

Federal court's jurisdiction that -- that what there would

20

have to be for your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, to

21

carry through is not simply a determination that there

22

might be a violation of Federal law.

23

QUESTION:

However, Ex Parte

Well, do you think in order to enter

24

a consent decree, the judge had to adjudicate that there

25

was a violation of Federal law?

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CRUZ:

No, Your Honor.

But in order for the

2

court now to exercise the coercive authority of the

3

Federal court and to order the State officials to engage

4

in a very detailed course of conduct, the predicate that

5

justifies the Young fiction in the first place is an

6

ongoing violation of Federal law.

7

QUESTION:

So you're -- you're telling us that

8

the effect of this consent decree, what Texas achieved by

9

it, is it comes into court and says, oh, let's -- let's

10

not fight about whether there was a violation or not,

11

we'll accept a consent decree, and the effect of this

12

consent decree is simply we'll fight about this same

13

question later.

Right?

MR. CRUZ:

It's crazy.

QUESTION:

7

but not to enforce it.

8
9

Would you take the same position if this had
been a litigated judgment and the exact same decree came

10

out at the end of the line?

11

well, this was an Ex Parte Young suit and even though we

12

litigated and lost, we can still say all bets are off

13

because at the enforcement stage, you have to prove the

14

case all over again.

15

And then the State says,

Now, are you making a distinction between a

16

consent decree and a litigated judgment, or do you accept

17

that this -- if this case had been litigated and that

1

MR. CRUZ:

It would be more difficult because

2

you at least had the predicate for Ex Parte Young in the

3

first place.

4

You had a violation of Federal law.

QUESTION:

Well, but it seems to me that when

5

matters are in doubt and a consent decree is entered,

it means -- that it is a question of Federal law.

MR. CRUZ:

The second part of Justice Ginsburg's

hypothetical about whether even if this were fully

There are a number of provisions in this consent decree --

So in other -- I take that to mean,

MR. CRUZ:

Absolutely.

decree.

We would -- we would say that --

MR. CRUZ:

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

-- that the order saying, A, you did

something wrong, you violated Federal law, and B, in the

11

future to avoid that, you've got to do the following

things, A, B, C -- you would say so long as at the moment

of enforcement we are not then violating Federal law in

MR. CRUZ:

Our answer is going to be that the --

the jurisdiction that this Court has created under Ex

vindicate the Supremacy Clause.

QUESTION:

No, but you're -- you're getting into

-- into a general answer, and I want a specific answer.

3

As I understand it, you would say that in -- that

4

following the litigated case with an A, B, C, D order, you

5

would say that if -- if the State -- if the -- if the

6

other side tried to enforce A, B, C, and D, you could come

into court and say, we are not now violating Federal law

in the sense originally alleged.

9

and E cannot be enforced.

10
11

Therefore, A, B, C, D,

Isn't that correct, that that

would be your position?
MR. CRUZ:

If C and D were necessary to ensure

12

compliance with Federal law, then they would be

13

permissible remedies once there was a finding under

14

Federal law.

15

QUESTION:

Well, all right.

Let's -- let's

16

compromise on an answer to the question.

17

would be we can always object to A, B, C, and D.

18

or may not succeed, but we can always object to it, even

19

though we haven't appealed it.

20

MR. CRUZ:

If there's an ongoing injunction --

21

QUESTION:

We didn't -- we didn't appeal saying,

Your answer
We may

22

look, Supreme Court, they -- you know, they -- they nailed

MR. CRUZ:

If the injunction is ongoing, then

3

the State officials could come in at any point and say, C,

QUESTION:

Can I ask you what is the purpose of

doing this?

8

regulations, the statutes.

I mean, let's think of the Medicare

They cover volumes.

Yours is only 80 pages.

Think of

I guess others

10

might be hundreds of pages.

11

that after these have been entered, they've been entered

12

because there was a violation of Federal law in the view

13

of the plaintiff and the defendant agreed.

14

And so what you're saying is

Okay?

Now, what you're saying is at any time, we go

15

through these hundreds of pages and we try to figure out

16

whether each word in these hundreds of pages actually in

17

itself reflects the Federal law violation, of which,

18

remember, there were 3,000 volumes, or the State law

19

violation, of which there were 10,000 more volumes, and

20

once we figured that out, then you're going to say you can

21

do paragraph 867 but you can't do paragraph 868.

just wonder what is the purpose of this exercise?

That's not answering my question at

5

all.

I -- I don't -- that's not --

So would you please direct yourself to my question?

6

MR. CRUZ:

The second response -- your -- your

7

question refers to volumes of Federal law and State law

8

that may or may not have been violated.

9

simple.

This case is very

It's one short section of Federal law.

10

QUESTION:

I'm not asking about this case.

I'm

11

asking about the purpose of the exercise that you are

12

suggesting that the Constitution requires us to undertake.

13

My suggestion was that it is -- I was trying to make it

14

look absurd to go through that exercise because it would

15

put everybody to a lot of work for no real reason.

16

was what I was trying to suggest.

17

you would respond to it because I'm sure you don't agree

18

with that, and therefore, I'd like you to present the

19

response.

20

MR. CRUZ:

That

Now, I suggested it so

Justice Breyer, the exercise of

21

requiring a -- a violation of Federal law derives from

22

this Court's cases beginning with Ex Parte Young and

23

moving on.

QUESTION:

You're saying the cases require it.

1

But I had the impression a different case had a much

2

better solution to the problem that you raise, which is

3

that there's some provisions in this thing that really

4

have nothing to do with Federal law at all.

5

called Rufo.

6

to do in that situation is you can make your argument.

You go to court.

And that's

And what the -- what -- what you're supposed

You say rule 60(b).

This has nothing to do with

And if the judge is right, you win.

Now, why

10

isn't that a much more practical approach for the problem

11

that you're raising?

12

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Breyer, under the Fifth

13

Circuit precedent, the means to challenge this sort of

14

decree is precisely what we did, to challenge it.

15

the Lelsz v. Kavanagh case, the means to challenge it is

16

to challenge the enforcement and --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Under

You mean you can never move for

modification prior to an enforcement action?
MR. CRUZ:

Well, you can, and that's the second

20

part which is the Fifth Circuit treated what we did as a

21

motion to modify or vacate the decree.

That's how the

22

Fifth Circuit interpreted what we did.

The -- the

23

plaintiffs came in at a year and a half --

them as a violation of Federal law.

Why don't you make a virtue of a

22

MR. CRUZ:

That --

MR. CRUZ:

MR. CRUZ:

My hope would be to make virtues out

16

of either approach and to say that it could either be done

17

on -- under an effort to modify or a challenge of

18

enforcement, that either avenue is available.

19

Fifth Circuit treated it as both.

20

precisely what the Fifth Circuit did.

QUESTION:

Well, but there are allegations of

6

violation of Federal law, did they not?

7

MR. CRUZ:

If those -- they did, and if those

8

allegations were true, then there are changed

9

circumstances because the district court was very clear

10

that there is absolutely no evidence that even a single

11

class member has ever requested services and been denied.

12

And that really is the nub of the dispute because

13

petitioner --

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's not an answer to all

15

-- the statute requires more than waiting for requests to

16

be made.

critical dispute because the statute, the Medicaid

made marvelous and extensive changes in your practices,

is not an ongoing violation of Federal law now.

What the Federal law requires is that whenever

an eligible member requests screening, they receive it.

Petitioners don't like that reading and what the

petitioners convinced the Federal district court to do in

this case is read the words where they are requested out

of the statute.

Well, but I want to know if you could

That's interesting.

Now, imagine -- I'll give a silly example to

14

make it clear -- that there's a requirement in the consent

15

decree you have to give every child a hair cut.

16

Federal law doesn't require that, but there's a provision

17

in State law that the barbers' union got in.

(Laughter.)

So every child has to have a hair

MR. CRUZ:

QUESTION:

You have to assume that it's too

onerous, that everything that goes -- goes a bit beyond

-- is that your theory of 60(b)?

19

MR. CRUZ:

Is that

It's not a bit beyond and -- and one

20

important caveat of 60(b) is most of this Court's 60(b)

21

cases are in a context where the State or a State official

22

is not a defendant.

23

QUESTION:

Well, 60(b) is basically changed

circumstances or changed law, isn't it?
MR. CRUZ:

It is.

you're dealing with a State or a municipality, that the

We don't necessarily concede that the

19

court should have entered this decree, but the point at

20

which we litigated it is the point at which the Federal

court began to exercise coercive authority of a Federal

22

court over the State.

23

QUESTION:

And at that point --

It didn't exercise authority till the

plaintiffs came in and said, look, they're violating the

They're not carrying out all their promises.

You could have said, yes, we are.

MR. CRUZ:

4

QUESTION:

You didn't say that.

5

MR. CRUZ:

We did say that.

6

We argued

extensively that we were carrying out our promises.

7

And that actually highlights a point.

8

petitioners argue a great deal is the unfairness, and that

9

was a motivating factor in this Court's Lapides decision.

But I would point out petitioners did not give anything up

when they signed this agreement.

effort to end this -- this litigation.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it imposed obligations on

the defendants which they had to perform in -- to avoid
being held in contempt of court.
MR. CRUZ:

Your Honor, that actually opens the

12

door to yet another reason why we do not believe this

13

Court should hold that Ex Parte Young defendants can

14

engage in commitments that extend far beyond Federal law

because that open -- opens a Pandora's box to separation

of powers problems.

MR. CRUZ:

It was

The State Attorney

Why shouldn't that be the end of the

Justice Scalia, the premise of the

18

question that the Attorney General had power to waive

19

sovereign immunity is not correct under Texas law.

20

it is admittedly a question of Federal law, but Federal

21

law looks to State law.

22

Now,

In answer to your question about waiver, we have

23

seven reasons why we believe the Court should not find

24

that there was a waiver.

25

First, that this was waived below.

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3

Secondly, there's no clear and unambiguous
waiver, as this Court's decisions require.
Thirdly, there has been no waiver by the

4

legislature of immunity from liability in State court, a

5

critical predicate for Lapides, and in fact, the United

6

States in Lapides argued that all the Attorney General

7

could waive was forum immunity, not immunity from

8

liability -- immunity from suit at all.

9

QUESTION:

May I stop you at that point?

Could

10

a State then simply say -- every State say our Attorney

11

General has no authority to waive our sovereign immunity,

12

and then you would have the highest legal officer

13

appearing in Federal court on behalf of the State and

14

representations that that person makes count for nothing?

15

Is that --

16

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Ginsburg, your -- your

17

hypothetical is in fact the law in the Texas, in that the

18

legislature has explicitly said the Attorney General may

19

not waive sovereign immunity in Government Code 402.004.

20

QUESTION:

Then what was the attorney -- then

21

the Attorney General was really deceiving the Federal

22

court when the Attorney General said, this is a consent

23

decree that we worked out, we urge the court to adopt it.

24

Now, if the Attorney General had no authority to enter

25

that consent decree, he should have told that to the

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

stage of enforcement.

16

the Supremacy Clause.

17

when no court has ever found a violation of Federal law,

18

and when there is in fact not a violation of Federal law.

19

The reasons petitioners are litigating today is

20

because if they had to demonstrate a violation of Federal

It means once a consent decree is there, the

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Only with the State Attorney General.

You haven't made another argument

14

that -- that I thought you -- you would make, and that is

15

not applicable to the waiver argument, which requires that

16

the State Attorney General or someone authorized to act

17

for the State is there.

18

about the non-waiver argument made by the petitioner is

19

that some of these consent decrees are imposed upon --

20

upon absolutely willing State officers who want to be

21

thrown into the briar patch.

22

-- a secretary of health and human services in the State

23

who absolutely wants to do these wonderful things for

24

pediatric care that are not required by Federal law.

Your

Attorney General appeared and said, this is okay as far as

9

we're concerned.

10

MR. CRUZ:

But -- but that is a fundamental

11

problem with these cases.

12

General, a prior head of the health department, and those

13

prior officers under petitioners' theory had bargained

14

away the legislature's authority.

15

legislature couldn't pass a statute that said, we're going

16

to allow the Federal District Court for the Eastern

17

District of Texas to run our Medicaid program.

powers.

ongoing violation of Federal law.

In

Lapides, in Gardner, in Clark, they were suits against the

State.

would be breaking new ground by saying an Ex Parte Young

defendant who, under the legal fiction, is not the State,

is simultaneously the State for purpose of being able to

waive sovereign immunity by litigating.

They were not Ex Parte Young cases, and this Court

8

And as was pointed out in the earlier colloquy,

9

the State was a defendant, raised the Eleventh Amendment,

10

was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.

11

And to say now that ambiguous and conflicting provisions

12

of the consent decree, signed by the State officials as Ex

13

Parte Young defendants, can waive the sovereign immunity

14

is to extend the Ex Parte Young fiction beyond --

QUESTION:

Well, surely they had attorneys,

State attorneys, representing them, did they not?
MR. CRUZ:

They -- they did, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

But those attorneys, just like the State officials, are

19

temporary officeholders, and temporary officeholders are

in effect, as this Court recognized in Alden v. Maine and

21

also in Justice Thomas' and Justice O'Connor's opinions in

22

Missouri v. Jenkins, there are serious separation of

powers issues that are raised when one official bargains

24

away the authority of another.

modify would allow State officials to present legitimate

concerns, if they have any, concerning the consent decree

19

to the district court so that the district -- with them

having the burden of proof, so that they could have their

best shot to show the district court what's wrong with the

22

consent decree under this Court's decision in Rufo.

-- that burden of proof gives the district court a full
