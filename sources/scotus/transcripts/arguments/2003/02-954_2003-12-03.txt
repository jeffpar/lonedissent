ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA MILLETT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In the course of their investigative work,

12

Federal law enforcement officials, of necessity, routinely

13

come into possession of substantial amounts of highly

14

sensitive and highly personal information.

15

information includes graphic death scene and autopsy

16

photographs.

17

and restricted use of law enforcement and public safety

18

officials.

19

public as a matter of law, custom, or practice.

20

Sometimes that

Those photographs are taken for the limited

They are not freely available to the general

The question presented in this case is whether

21

death scene photographs should be broadly disclosed to the

22

general public under the Freedom of Information Act.

23

should not.

24

not maximum disclosure, but responsible disclosure, and

25

the publication of death scene photographs goes beyond the

They

The Freedom of Information Act's purpose is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

bounds of responsible disclosure, because in the terms of

2

exemption 7(C), production could reasonably be expected to

3

constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy

4

of surviving family members.

5

In ordering the release of four photographs in

6

this case, the court of appeals recognized that that

7

substantial intrusion on privacy would occur, but it then

8

committed three errors in assessing the countervailing

9

public interest in disclosure.

10

QUESTION: Must there be identifiable family

11

members to suffer this invasion of privacy?

12

be automatic instead?

13

assume that there was someone?

14

Would it just

The - a scene like this, you would

MS. MILLETT: No, the - the practice of the

15

Federal Government is that we need to identify the

16

existence of a survivor.

17

excuse me - District Court, named Outlaw, that I believe

18

was cited in respondent's brief, where the Department of

19

Defense had asserted survivor privacy without having first

20

identified a survivor, and that was held to be

21

impermissible, and as a matter of practice, because this

22

is sort of specialized application of privacy interest,

23

the Government identifies a survivor before invoking it.

24

But that is often not a difficult job because the types of

25

records that bring the photos to us, law enforcement

There was a case in the D.C. -

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

records, military records when it's a military service

2

member who's been autopsied, will often contain, or allow

3

the identification, of family members.

4

QUESTION: And if you're so unfortunate as not to

5

have survivors, or to have survivors who don't like you,

6

the most embarrassing and gory photographs of your body

7

can be released?

8
9

MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, that has been
the practice after the Outlaw decision of the Federal

10

Government.

11

because you're talking about an objective test, at least

12

under 7(C) - some of these photographs are held - upheld

13

under - or withheld under exemption 6, which doesn't have

14

the same objective test language.

15

that the Government could justify withholding, in a

16

situation like after the collapse of the World Trade

17

Center towers, and their substantial amounts of - sorry,

18

but, for the graphic nature - but partial remains that

19

can't be matched with particular individuals.

20

It - it's not inconceivable to me that

It's not inconceivable

But we know that for some significant percentage

21

of those people, there are a significant percentage of

22

survivors on a match for match.

23

would argue should not be required and that withholding

24

could be done because we -

25

In that case, I think we

QUESTION: But only on the assumption that there

4

are survivors?
MS. MILLETT: On the assumption that there - a
reasonable - obviously, a reasonable assumption QUESTION: I don't know why that's necessary.

5

don't know why you - you can't say, and I think some

6

courts have held, have they not, that - that there is a

7

privacy interest in the - in the person who's died?

8
9

I

MS. MILLETT: For the most part, courts have said
that privacy dies with the individual, but again, the

10

problem in this case is the Ninth Circuit didn't think we

11

were withholding too little.

12

were withholding too much that - and that, in fact, when

13

there are known survivors, these - these disturbing

14

photographs still have to be released.

15

they committed three errors.

16

It rule - it ruled that we

And in doing that,

QUESTION: Before we get to that though, on the

17

question that was asked, if there are no survivors, given

18

that the main rule of FOIA is disclosed, unless you fall

19

under an exemption, and exemptions are to be narrowly

20

construed, I don't think the - the Government could

21

suppose, could hypothesize an interest that may or may not

22

have existed in the decedent when there are no survivors.

23

MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that has

24

been the Government's practice, is to identify a survivor,

25

but again, I think our position is, because the nature of

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

our world has changed and we now have to deal with

2

situations involving mass deaths, that we aren't going to

3

insist when you have a large collection of remains and we

4

know that for some percentage of those there - there are

5

survivors, that withholding would still be permissible.

6

QUESTION: But why is that any less of a leap

7

than saying the deceased - the deceased's privacy is being

8

invaded?

9

- the privacy of the survivors is being invaded?

Why is it less of a leap to say that the privacy
It

10

doesn't seem to me that it's - it's their privacy that's

11

being invaded.

12

various other things, but - but it seems to me strange to

13

speak of their having a privacy interest.

14

have an interest in not having their - their - their

15

relative displayed this way, but I - I wouldn't normally

16

call that a privacy interest.

It's - it's their - their sensitivity,

Surely they

17

MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, the common

18

law - a number of common law courts did, and they did -

19

and we cite - one of the very first common law courts ever

20

to recognize the right to privacy, in 1895, the Schuler v.

21

Curtis case, which is cited in our reply brief, found

22

exactly a privacy interest in the survivors, and it said

23

it is not the privacy interest of the deceased, because

24

under the common law tradition, privacy dies with the

25

individual.

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But what's being protected here is the

2

survivors.

It sort of takes three forms, first of all,

3

their - their memory of the deceased, their ability to

4

provide a dignified disposition of the body, and the

5

ability to have seclusion in their grief and repose and

6

closure.

7

recognized as a privacy right, both at tort law by a

8

number of courts, and more broadly, by custom and practice

9

in this country.

And those concepts packaged together have been

These types of photographs are not

10

freely available virtually anywhere.

11

states, as we've cited in our brief, prevent their

12

disclosure or have restrictions on their disclosure.

13

A large number of

QUESTION: Well, I guess we're, in this case,

14

asked to apply FOIA's exemption 7(C) to interpret it

15

anyway.

16

MS. MILLETT: Yes.

17

QUESTION: Right?

18

MS. MILLETT: Yes.

19

QUESTION: So that's what we're focused on.

20

MS. MILLETT: Yes.

21

QUESTION: And what do you propose as the test?

22

MS. MILLETT: The test - the test is, as this

23

Court has - to decide whether a - a invasion of privacy is

24

clearly unwarranted, you have to weigh and balance the

25

intrusion on privacy against the extent to which the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

information disclosed would, in this Court's Reporters

2

Committees decision, contribute significantly to public

3

understanding of the operations or activities of the

4

Federal Government.

5

balance is a substantial intrusion on privacy, requiring -

6

And in this case, on one side of the

exposing this sort of information out where family

7

members will see it, encounter it, where they will know

8

that their - that their loved one has not been buried in

9

any sense.

10
11

QUESTION: Is that the test that the CADC used in
the Accuracy in Media case involving these same photos?

12
13

MS. MILLETT: They used a - the same balancing.
They recognized the -

14
15

QUESTION: So whatever you're proposing, you
think the CADC correctly employed in that case?

16

MS. MILLETT: The - there - with - with one

17

qualification, which I don't think is a distinction -

18

don't think it's a distinction that makes a difference.

19

Certainly on the privacy interest side, they agreed with

20

us that there's a survivor privacy interest and that that

21

has to be balanced under this Court's Reporters Committee

22

standard.

23

Now, the D.C. Circuit has said with - when the

24

public interest that's asserted is substantial allegation,

25

or is unsubstantiated allegations of governmental

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

misconduct, that's not enough.

2

evidence of governmental misconduct to overcome the

3

presumption of regularity.

4

clear as evidence.

5

difference.

6

because that's the standard this Court has adopted for

7

overcoming a presumption of regularity.

8
9

They require compelling

We've articulated the test is

I don't think in practice there's any

We've employed the clear evidence standard

QUESTION: I'm - I'm - I'm glad you backed off
from compelling evidence.

It seems to me if there were

10

compelling evidence of Government's misdoing, you wouldn't

11

need the photographs.

12

photographs would - would not prove anything additional

13

and you would - you would reject it for that reason,

14

right?

15

If it was already compelling, the

MS. MILLETT: That may - that may well be.

The

16

compelling - the way the compelling evidence standard

17

works, as we understand it, and the way the clear evidence

18

standard works that we propose is not that that means you

19

get the photographs.

20

something of weight on your side of the balance.

21

the unsubstantiated allegations of governmental misconduct

22

are worth virtually none, if no weight -

23

It just means that you have
We think

QUESTION: But are the - does the term compelling

24

interest refer to the allegations that the person seeking

25

the photographs makes, or the evidence he has supporting

1

5

his position?
MS. MILLETT: It has to be the - the evidence of
governmental misconduct.

Empty allegations -

QUESTION: Independently of what the - the
photographs themselves would show?

6

MS. MILLETT: That - I mean, that presumably will

7

not be the evidence, right, you can't just come say that -

8
9

that would be sort of boot-strapping to say that the
evidence is the - I have to see that so that I will have

10

my evidence of your governmental misconduct, which

11

essentially -

12
13
14

QUESTION: Okay, tell me again what - what the
test is as you - you understand it.
MS. MILLETT: The - the test - you mean with

15

respect to unsubstantiated allegations of governmental

16

misconduct?

17

QUESTION: Yes.

18

MS. MILLETT: That is that the FOIA requester

19

must come forward with clear evidence of governmental

20

misconduct on their own, independent evidence on their

21

own, to have a cognizable public interest to weigh against

22

the intrusion on privacy that has occurred in this case.

23

And that is the standard that this - the clear evidence

24

standard comes from this Court's decisions, which say that

25

is the quantum of evidence needed to overcome the

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

presumption of regularity and legitimacy that attaches in

2

this case to law enforcement investigations.

3

QUESTION: Does the Government - does the

4

Government - as I understand FOIA, the Government has the

5

burden of proof, the Government presents an exemption and

6

it is the Government's burden to show that the exemption

7

applies, not the requester, because going in, am I right

8

to say, the requester can ask for this information for any

9

reason or no reason?

10

MS. MILLETT: That - that's - with respect -

11

until an exemption is triggered, there's no need to have

12

any reason for your FOIA.

13

bad reason, or no reason to ask for information, but -

14

QUESTION: So what is the Government's burden

You can have a good reason, a

15

that it has, at least the initial burden is on the

16

Government to show what?

17

MS. MILLETT: The - the initial burden on the

18

Government is once an exemption - we have to show that an

19

exemption is triggered.

20

identify a cognizable privacy interest which -

We have to, in this situation,

21

QUESTION: Now, after you point to which number,

22

7, you point to 7(C) and that - that - the burden must be

23

more than just, say -

24
25

MS. MILLETT: No, that - that's right, in fact,
we get the written steps.

We have to identify a

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cognizable privacy interest and then, before we make a

2

decision to withhold, we ourselves must make the - must

3

balance.

4

invoke an exemption, so we ourselves will then try to

5

identify if we can from the requester's papers or on our

6

own what public interest would be served by the disclosure

7

of these documents.

8
9

It's our job to do this balancing before we

Now, it's not the particular interest of the
requester, but it's the relationship between this document

10

and serving the public interest that was identified in

11

Reporters Committee of revealing the operations or

12

activities of the Government.

13

we found a substantial privacy interest here, and then we

14

looked at photographs of a deceased body at a death scene

15

and in our judgement, these reveal nothing about the

16

operations or activities of the Office of Independent

17

Counsel and - and -

18

So in this case, we looked,

QUESTION: Ms. Millett, you - you - you say that

19

you have to show clear evidence of - have clear evidence

20

of government misconduct.

21

What - what has been brought forward here, at least, are

22

some disparities in - in various governmental reports,

23

which suggest that at least there was negligence or

24

sloppiness in some of the reports.

25

establish what you mean by governmental misconduct?

What do you mean by misconduct?

Is that enough to
Or

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

does it have to be some willful cover-up?

2

MS. MILLETT: Justice Scalia, first of all, I

3

don't think there's any evidence of negligence or

4

sloppiness here, but if we adopt that -

5
6

QUESTION: All right, well, we - we'll get to
that, I assume, right?

7

Okay.

MS. MILLETT: If we adopt that characterization,

8

the fact that someone cannot - can identify something more

9

that they should have been done, or the fact that - that

10

they disagree with the ultimate result, is not

11

governmental misconduct.

12

rise - that - that might count, is something that was - if

13

you had evidence that, you know, governmental

14

investigators had suborned perjury, and you had evidence

15

in the form of -

The type of thing that might

MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?

QUESTION: Has to be willful?

21

Has to be willful?

It cannot be just

Why - why isn't that of interest to the

MS. MILLETT: I don't - I - I don't think - well,

22

if - if they've got evidence of a sloppy job, then FOIA

23

has already worked.

24

- it's not a 60(b) motion to reopen an investigation or to

25

make us investigate more.

They can - the purpose of FOIA is not

It's to see - learn what the

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government did and then critique it as much as you like.

2

QUESTION: Okay.

Why - why then do you take the

3

- I'm sorry - why - why do you take the position that to

4

satisfy the - the - the condition of revealing the

5

operation of the Government, it's necessarily got to

6

reveal something to the discredit of the Government?

7

if someone came along and said, I think this was a superb

8

investigation, and the Government is far too modest about

9

what it has done, and I - I want the country to know?

10

What

Would - would that support a claim?

11

MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Souter, let me be

12

very clear.

13

misconduct because that is the public interest that is

14

asserted.

15

We're talking here about the allegations of

One might be able to QUESTION: Right, but if misconduct - my - the

16

reason I'm raising the question is, if misconduct does not

17

have to be shown, I suppose that would have a bearing on

18

the degree of misconduct in a case like this that would -

19

that would suffice.

20

MS. MILLETT: Well, a public interest has to be

21

identified at some point, and the problem with this case

22

is, or the problem -

24
25

QUESTION: No, but what about my question for a
minute?
MS. MILLETT: Right.

They are hiding their

I - I want the people to know how -

how fine they've done.

Why is that not a - a possible

legitimate objective under the statute?

7

MS. MILLETT: Well, I think that - that - that is

8

sort of nothing more than - than a desire to show what the

9

Government did in this investigation, transparency in

10

government interest, which is the point of FOIA.

11

you've come to an - applying an exemption, you're going to

12

need something more on your side than just serving the

13

general interests that FOIA itself advances, because

14

otherwise, the exemption doesn't work as an exemption.

You have to want - want something more than transparency

in government.

But once

Now, it may not be that you have to show

misconduct.

19

some other sort of acute public interest that's going to

outweigh it, but I think in the end, the public interest

in making the Government look good or telling the

Government did is never going to be enough to outweigh the

privacy interests of individuals.

7

FOR RESPONDENTS ANTHONY AND MOODY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HAMILTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There are five basic reasons why the privacy

12

interest at issue in this case should be protected.

13

First, the Foster family seeks to protect their own,

14

wholly legitimate privacy interests.

15

interests here of the family are to be free from seeing

16

these photographs on television and in grocery store

17

tabloids, to be free from the knowledge that these

18

photographs are displayed in virtual perpetuity on

19

ghoulish Web sites that show death and carnage, to be free

20

from the harassment by the media that inevitably will

21

follow if these photographs are released.

22

The privacy

Second, while FOIA privacy protection is

23

broader, there is significant common law authority that a

24

survivor's right of privacy is violated by showing

25

photographs of deceased loved ones.

autopsy reports, and Justice Ginsburg joined in that

opinion.

14

There is a 1987 opinion in the D.C.

QUESTION: Mr. Hamilton, assume we agree with you

15

on all of that.

16

- the other half of the inquiry, and that is what the

17

public interest is in - that might overcome that - that -

18

We haven't heard anything about the other

that privacy interest.

I'm sure the other side is going

19

to - is going to talk about that, the - the alleged

20

discrepancies in the reports and whatnot.

21

shed some light on that?

22

Can - can you

MR. HAMILTON: Well, Justice Scalia, we think

23

that there is no public interest on the other side.

24

think as - as counsel for the Solicitor General has said,

25

that there's a strong evidence test for showing that there

is government - government misconduct where that is the

2

allegation of the public interest, which is the situation

3

here.

4

should be compelling evidence.

5

that in several cases.

6

Other circuits have come to other standards in - in terms

7

of what the public interest should be, but it must be

8

something that is strong, that is not insubstantial.

9

A - a number of courts have said that the test
The D.C. Circuit has done

The Fourth Circuit has done it.

Secondly, in determining what the public

10

interest is, the Court must be aware that there have been

11

five investigations, five investigations of Mr. Foster's

12

death, and all of them have found that he died by suicide.

13

These investigations have released over 3,000 documents

14

over -

15

QUESTION: Yes, but it seems to me that the -

16

arguably, the interest in disclosure might not challenge

17

the ultimate conclusion, but rather they might contend -

18

want to show that one of the team of investigators was

19

totally incompetent, and it was necessary to have three or

20

four other investigations to reach the correct result.

21

don't think the ultimate conclusion necessarily answers

22

the - the claim that there may be some public interest in

23

how the investigation was conducted.

I

24

MR. HAMILTON: Well, Justice Stevens, the - 7(C)

25

requires a balancing, and when you have this balance, you

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to weigh whatever the public interest is against the

2

privacy interest.

3

investigations, where the reports are voluminous, where

4

the documents released and the photographs already

5

released are voluminous, it is very difficult to see what

6

the public interest is in getting these photographs, which

7

would grossly invade the privacy of the family.

And here, where there have been five

item of evidence, I mean, like the - the autopsy report

11

that Mr. Favish claims was - was - was altered, that the

12

word neck was white - whitened out and head was written in

13

instead to - to cover the fact that the bullet exited the

14

neck rather than the head.

15

and other conspiracy theorists would say is, the fact that

16

five investigations came up with the same conclusion just

17

shows the extent of this - this conspiracy, you know.

18

They're not going to be satisfied by the mere fact that -

Now, you know, what - what he

that you had five separate groups.

They're going to say,

20

oh, all the worse, all the worse, this - this conspiracy

21

is so widespread.

Well, how do you respond to that?

MR. HAMILTON: Well, I think the first response I

23

would make is that it is a difficult argument to make that

Judge Starr conspired with members of the Clinton

25

administration to protect that administration.

10
11

to remand even if we adopt the Government's argument?
MR. HAMILTON: I - I believe that on the record

12

before the Court, the Court can decide that there is no

13

valid public interest here, and that the interest of - the

14

privacy interest of the Foster family greatly outweighs -

15

QUESTION: So you want us to do that weighing?

16

MR. HAMILTON: I - I certainly do.

I want this

17

case to end at this Court, Justice Kennedy.

It has been

10 years and it is time to give this family some peace.

recall what standard the district court applied in the

first instance, but it was the Ninth Circuit that - that

1

said, district court, you have to look at these and

2

disclose the ones that aren't, whatever that series of

3

adjectives is.

4

QUESTION: Yes.

That - that's my concern.

Is

5

there evidence that the district court used the standard

6

that the Government now argues for in the first - when he

7

- when the - Judge Keller first looked at this case, did

8

he adopt basically what the Government is asking us to

9

adopt?

10

MR. HAMILTON: Not - not exactly.

No, he did not

11

adopt a - a clear evidence test, but the district court in

12

the first instance, in his first decision, did weigh the

13

public interest against the privacy interest and found

14

that as to all of the photographs, the privacy interest

15

prevailed.

16

I would like to - I would like to return to the

17

- the family's privacy interest and make one more point,

18

which is that law and tradition treat the moment

19

surrounding death as special, private family matters.

20

family generally has the right to decide how to conduct

21

its leave-taking and how to dispose of the body of a loved

22

one with dignity.

23

whether a coffin is open or is shut, and they have that

24

choice even if the deceased person was a public official.

25

Here, the Foster family decided that the coffin be shut,

and to effectively open it now by disclosing the

2

photographs would be an unconscionable invasion of the

3

family's privacy interest.

4

In the Reporters Committee brief, the contention

5

was made that the invasion of sorts here would be minimal

6

and would impose no meaningful additional harm.

7

assertion is just simply wrong, and those claims ignore

8

the potent and the moving declarations submitted in this

These declarations

express what any family in the circumstance would feel,

QUESTION: There's a tradition going back

3

thousands of years in human life.

4

Antigone, Euripides, every major religion, respect for the

5

dead, respect for survivors, and that runs through every

6

religion, through Greek myth, tragedy, and why isn't that

7

important enough to human life to believe that Congress

8

also intended to encompass that?

9

You can go back to

MR. FAVISH: I believe it is an important

10

interest, but Congress left no indication that it intended

11

for that interest to be protected by the privacy language

12

in exemption 7(C).

13

QUESTION: Well, if the history is totally

14

silent, why wouldn't we assume that Congress intended to

15

recognize something so deep in human nature?

16
17

MR. FAVISH: Well, the - the legislative history
isn't totally silent.

18

QUESTION: No, I mean if they said, no, no, we do

19

not intend to respect this sacred tradition, fine.

20

8

the word privacy is not a - the normal way of - of

9

expressing those concerns for respect for the dead.

10

MR. FAVISH: I agree, I agree, and that's why I

11

cited what this Court did in Reporters Committee, and

12

those concerns are valid and those concerns should be made

13

to Congress in an attempt to get them to add another

15

the Foster respondents want.

We know that -

QUESTION: You've heard - you've heard Mr.

17

Hamilton mention aspects of how the revelation of

18

documents, pictures of the dead, can injure a survivor.

19

Why isn't the word privacy broad enough at least to cover

20

that?

21

MR. FAVISH: That's not the way this Court

22

defined it in Reporters Committee.

I've seen it defined anywhere else except a few

aberrational cases, which by the way -

That's not the way

definitions that I think we instinctively assume is the

2

very simple one that Justice Brandeis used, the right to

be let alone.

privacy thinking in our law, and the right to be let

alone, I suppose, would encompass at least two things

relevant in this case.

upsetting.

And the second consequence, I would suppose, of

privacy encompassed by this word, and no other.

3

gone back to a case in which we were talking about the

interests of the living, and you say it can't be anything

5

more than that.

6

privacy is such a circumscribed concept in the exemption?

7

You've

Why do you make the assumption that

MR. FAVISH: Well, the word privacy, if it's

going to be meaning the right to be let alone in its

9

broadest sense, I suppose anything that could be

10

considered a tort then would be considered a violation of

11

somebody's privacy right.

QUESTION: Mr. Favish, do - do we have any case

law that suggests that the exemptions to the Freedom of

14

Information Act are to be narrowly construed?

response to why you should not think that privacy means

MR. FAVISH: Exactly.

21

QUESTION: Or anything beyond its narrowest

22

meaning?

23

MR. FAVISH: I - I -

24

25

MR. FAVISH: Yes, absolutely.

That's established

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that these are to be narrowly construed, and that was a

2

part of the legislative intent of Congress to have the

3

exemptions clearly delineated, specific, so that there

4

would be clear standards.

5

reason for the Freedom of Information Act being enacted in

6

1966, because the prior enactment was allowing the

7

Government to take ambiguous language and cover every

8

document with it.

9

In fact, that was the - the

So if you are going to come up with another

10

definition of privacy, it has to fit within that

11

legislative intent.

12

QUESTION: Are you saying that this Court,

13

because of the definition in Reporters Committee, has

14

already recognized that it's got to be the individual that

15

is in the photograph and families are out of it?

16

- that - that's - so you would - you would say the D.C.

QUESTION: Yeah, but it went back to the district

MR. FAVISH: The district court made the decision

that there was a privacy interest, but it wasn't the D.C.

9

Circuit that made that decision, and the D.C. -

10

QUESTION: But in - in any event, you would say

11

that district court decision was off-limits because this

12

was a case of survivor grief, no information about the

14

MR. FAVISH: Yes, I would.

control of information concerning his or her person.

2

right to control information about yourself.

3

nothing else in the word privacy from the common law,

4

other than a minority of aberrational cases, and certainly

5

nothing in the legislative history that would come up with

this relational tort, this survivor privacy -

otherwise by the courts below?

talk about the government conduct on two separate levels.

13

One, there was government conduct in investigating Mr.

14

Foster's death, finding out what happened to him.

15

there was government conduct in reporting about that death

16

and the investigation to the public.

17

reporting agencies here were the Fiske and Starr OICs.

18

And I

Second,

The primary

Now, with regard to the first area of government

19

conduct, the investigation as to finding out what

20

happened, it's just educated guesses that the public can

21

make about whether there was any negligence here.

22

with regard to the second area of whether or not the

23

reporting conduct by the Government was at least

24

negligent, we know to a 100 percent certainty that there

25

was at least negligence, because we know that - let me

talk about what Justice Scalia talked about, the autopsy

report.

To be more correct, Your Honor, it was a - a

That's not true.

Mr. Starr ignored

That's one of the problems

10

here.

11

Well, nobody investigated that language on the Haut

report.

13

We talk about these different investigations.

Nobody investigated the FBI QUESTION: Explain how the - the four documents

14

that we're concerned with don't talk about - none of them

15

show head and neck, so I don't - we - we hear only about

16

those four documents, right?

17

and the Ninth Circuit said, right, not all ten but only

18

those four?

19

with head and neck.

20

And none of those four have anything to do

MR. FAVISH: I - I - I'm - I'm not sure I follow

21

your question.

22

play here because -

23

Because the district court

I - I understand that all 10 photos are at

QUESTION: Well, that - that's what I'd like

24

clarified, because I thought that we are reviewing a

25

decision that the Government has asked us to review, which

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said, Government, disclose four photographs.

2

MR. FAVISH: My understanding is that the

3

petition that was granted by the Government had, as its

4

question presented, was the Office of Independent Counsel

5

correct in withholding all of these photographs?

6

under the -

7
8

QUESTION: But the court below said yes with
respect to six of them.

9

QUESTION: Didn't you cross-petition on the six?
I thought you cross-petitioned.

12
13

So how do we get to review that?

MR. FAVISH: Yeah, the -

10
11

And

MR. FAVISH: Yes, I did, and that's being held
over.

14

QUESTION: That's the answer.

15

QUESTION: Right.

16

MR. FAVISH: So I believe all 10 photos are at

17
18

play here in what decision you come up with, because the all the issues presented by all three petitioners are

19

subsumed under the question presented in the petition that

20

you granted.

21

QUESTION: I'm worried about - suppose you won. I

22

take it the police investigate hundreds of thousands or

23

millions or crimes every year, and in those investigations

24

they may investigate people whom they later conclude are

25

innocent, perhaps again hundreds of thousands of millions

1

of them.

2

people, be lots of newspapers or others who would like to

3

have the police records about people found to be innocent.

4

And, of course, there might, in respect to those

Now, what would protect these thousands or

5

hundreds of thousands of innocent people from having the

6

police investigation of them displayed on the front page

7

of their local paper if you were to win this case?

8

MR. FAVISH: Well, if I was one of those people

9

that you're talking about and -

10

QUESTION: Yes, well -

11

MR. FAVISH: - and there's information about me

12

in the document, I have a privacy interest in the

13

document, is what my position is.

14

QUESTION: Well, if you - but suppose you won

15

this, if you won it, then you and everybody else, let's

16

say millions of people, you don't mind perhaps, or not

17

enough, you don't mind enough, but a lot of people would

18

mind having a police report about them on the front page

19

of the local paper.

20

MR. FAVISH: Well, then, in that case -

21

QUESTION: Now, what is it that - if you win, I

22

don't see that those people would have any protection

23

whatsoever.

24
25

MR. FAVISH: The protection would be in the
balancing that's done to see -

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: The balancing would be that the police

2

had found them innocent, and it's not that hard if you win

3

this, where there have been five investigations, for

4

somebody to say, oh, there was a police cover-up, they

5

weren't really innocent.

6

MR. FAVISH: I -

7

QUESTION: And if there are two investigations,

8

they'll still say it, and there'll always be something

9

that isn't perfect about the investigation, so they'll

10

have a peg to hang their hat on.

11

MR. FAVISH: Under the balancing, all the factors

12

must be taken into account.

13

situation here of a deputy White House counsel, public

14

official, very close to the President of the United

15

States, who was under investigation at the time, there

16

were documents related to that investigation in Mr.

17

Foster's office, that is why Kenneth Starr and Robert

18

Fiske investigated this.

20

gunshot.

21

hypothetical about.

22

We have an almost unique

We're talking about the highest

This is not one of the cases that you pose a
This is something unique and -

QUESTION: But I don't see how you can confine it

23

to uniqueness. Why doesn't everyone in every hometown in

24

America have a - a very significant interest in whether

25

their police department is adequately investigating and

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

evaluating reports of homicide.

Of course they have an -

an interest in that.

3

MR. FAVISH: I -

4

QUESTION: Every - everyone in - in - in any

5

Federal district has an interest in whether the United

6

States Attorney and the FBI and so on are investigating

7

serious crimes, and I - I don't see how you can confine

8

this to what you call the unique case.

9
10
11

MR. FAVISH: I - I'm not saying it would be
confined.

I'm saying that this is what sets those other -

this case apart from the others.

But in principle,

12

unless it falls within one of the exemptions, then that

13

information would have to be made public -

14

QUESTION: So -

15

MR. FAVISH: - under the FOIA as it currently

16

exists.

17

QUESTION: But here's the - I think one of the -

18

the - one of the things that's bothering Justice Breyer,

19

and it's bothering me, if we accept as broad a principle

20

as you argue for, is this: that one of the things that -

21

that most police investigators learn very early on is that

22

when they investigate a crime and they investigate a

23

suspect, the suspect's old friends and enemies come

24

forward, and the latter frequently even up some old

25

scores.

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The amount of misinformation that is

2

intentionally communicated to law enforcement officers is

3

enormous.

4

that that kind of misinformation is - is - is going to

5

come very close to the front page in most cases if - if a

6

principle as broad as yours is accepted.

7

They have to evaluate that, and it seems to me

MR. FAVISH: Well, first of all, I believe in the

8

FOIA, in exemption 7, there is an exemption for ongoing

9

investigations, so much of what you're talking about -

10

QUESTION: Well, yeah, but the - the problem for

11

the person being investigated who is ultimately exonerated

12

is going to be the same the day after the investigation is

13

- is over.

14

So that - that doesn't answer the problem.

MR. FAVISH: Yeah.

Now, I'm just talking about

15

the privacy exemption in 7(C).

16

hypothetical whether there would be other exemptions to

17

prevent disclosure in those situations.

18

commenting on that.

Now, I don't know in your

I'm not

Now, with regard - yes.

19

QUESTION: Neither - neither do I, in fact.

20

QUESTION: Mr. Favish, here's - here's my - I

21

mean, one - once you get past the first - the first issue,

22

whether the privacy exemption at all covers this, if you

23

assume it does cover it, you have relatives here who are

24

going to be very much - very much harmed by - by this, as

25

is shown by the mere fact that they've conducted this

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

lengthy litigation.

2

it's been expensive.

3

It's lasted how long, and I'm sure

Now, what is the interest on the other side?

If

4

- if you - if you had a plausible case that - that these

5

investigations reached the wrong conclusion, I'd say,

6

yeah, that's a pretty significant governmental interest.

7

But I don't see that here.

8

demonstrated some foot faults in - in each of the

9

investigations.

I - you - you - you've just

Oh, this - this investigation made this

10

mistake, this other investigation made the other mistake.

11

Who cares?

12

of - of significant moment for - for the country, that

13

there was an isolated mistake in - in one and another of

14

the investigations?

15

I mean, you really think that that is a matter

Who cares?

MR. FAVISH: Justice Scalia, I would not

16

characterize them as foot faults.

17

omissions of significant evidence that pointed away from

18

the Government's official conclusion, and what it

19

establishes is that the government reports are not

20

trustworthy.

21

correct and it was suicide in the park.

22

I think these are major

I agree that in the end those reports may be

Again, like I said earlier, I can just make

23

educated guesses about that.

24

definitely something other than that, but I am saying that

25

when you have a high-level government official involved in

I'm not saying that it was

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this kind of investigation, and then you have so many

2

investigations by the Government, apparently to get it

3

right, that it took so many, you have a public interest

4

here, unlike almost any other case I could imagine.

5
6
7
8
9

QUESTION: Well, why should the high level of the
victim make that much difference?
MR. FAVISH: As opposed to just an innocuous
neighbor down the street, perhaps.
QUESTION: Well, say a - a public interest in

10

something that happens in Albuquerque, New Mexico, maybe

11

the assistant to the mayor is shot.

12

MR. FAVISH: Because we're dealing with somebody

13

who was working close to the President of the United

14

States and we're talking about the Freedom of Information

15

Act, whose primary purpose is to allow the people to be a

16

check on government, not only to -

17

QUESTION: Well, but - but why - why wouldn't

18

that be just as true of this incident, hypothetical

19

incident in Albuquerque as the Vince Foster slaying?

20

MR. FAVISH: Well, it very well might be with

21

regard to city or state government and states have their

22

own open records acts, and as we heard before, some of

23

them prohibit death photos, but they do that by

24

legislation.

25

in response to amicus Teresa Earnhardt's plea.

We know that the State of Florida did that
That's

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what should be done here if they want the Federal

2

Government to follow the lead of the state legislatures

3

here.

4

It's not for the courts, with all due respect,

5

to rewrite the FOIA exemption, so I - I'm not disagreeing

6

that that's a valid concern, but the way -

7

QUESTION: Well, you're - you're - you're getting

8

away from the hypothetical.

9

you insist on taking this line, could be refined so that

10

we assume New Mexico has exactly the same statute and has

11

interpreted exactly the same way.

12

the hypothetical.

13

The hypothetical, if you - if

Then you have to answer

MR. FAVISH: Oh, absolutely then.

If - if the

14

balancing is done and you're talking about a law like FOIA

15

where the primary purpose is to allow the people to ensure

16

that their government is honest, because that's the heart

17

of our democracy and we're talking about the integrity of

18

our law enforcement agencies, I can think of no higher

19

public interest than what's being asserted here.

20

again, all of this is going to have to be -

21

And

QUESTION: So - so - so then it doesn't just turn

22

on the fact that it's Vince Foster and that - and the

23

Chief Justice's point is - is that this was going to apply

24

to every police department, every - every local government

25

in the country that has an act like this?

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FAVISH: Well, in principle, yes.

How the

2

balancing would come out in each individual case would

3

depend on the ad hoc balancing, but the principles would -

4

would be the same if the law is the same, I agree.

5

QUESTION: When a person goes to work for the

6

Government, on top of everything else, he even loses a

7

private right to bury the body.

8

metaphorically, but, I mean, there are a lot of

9

disadvantages in government, and you're saying one of the

10

things would be that after death there is no protection,

11

even to see that that body is buried and the photographs

12

disappear for the - for the -

I mean, I'm speaking

13

MR. FAVISH: Well -

14

QUESTION: It would just go on forever.

15

MR. FAVISH: Well, we're not talking about

16

interfering with the - the burial process.

17

QUESTION: No, I know.

18

metaphorically.

I'm speaking

I have Antigone in my mind.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. FAVISH: Again, as I read the FOIA exemption

21

7(C), the privacy exemption, Congress has not legislated

22

that the Government is allowed to withhold death

23

photographs under this privacy exemption.

24

that's a good public policy to enact, we should get

25

Congress to hold hearings on it and we'll find out all the

If we think

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

yeas and the nays and that's how good legislation comes.

2

And that's what should be done here and -

3

QUESTION: What does privacy cover without that?

4

Are you suggesting that there be a catalog A to Z of - and

5

the - and the word privacy within the meaning of 7(c)

6

covers, and that's -

7
8

MR. FAVISH: Oh, in terms of what Congress might
do or what this Court might do?

9

QUESTION: No, in terms of - the Court has no

10

leeway unless Congress has such a catalog and this is one

11

of the enumerated items -

12

MR. FAVISH: Well, we know that Congress used the

13

phrase, personal privacy, in the statute, and now the

14

debate is over what did they mean by that.

15

apparently, people are scribing words, Alice-in-

16

Wonderland-like definitions to words, and if we go down

17

that route -

18

And

QUESTION: But it's not very Alice in Wonderland-

19

like to take the Brandeis definition that started this

20

all.

21
22

MR. FAVISH: What I like about the Brandeis
article is -

23
24
25

QUESTION: I think it's Alice in Wonderlandlike.
MR. FAVISH: What I like about the Brandeis

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

article is the section of that article that was cited by

2

this Court in Reporters Committee.

3

was one of the six scholarly articles.

4

the Brandeis article, 1890, was maybe the earliest trying

5

to come up with a definition of privacy, so the language

6

isn't as precise as what, for instance, former Solicitor

7

General Fried came up with in his seminal 1966 article,

8

also cited by this Court.

9

The Brandeis article
Now, keep in mind,

So I would say that the best definition that

10

provides the clearest workable standard is the right to

11

control information about yourself, and again, on the

12

second point here, I - I won't go down the litany of

13

things that are in the brief talking about how there was

14

misconduct, at least negligence with regard to reporting

15

this case, but once I've established that, which I have, I

16

think that the Government can no longer be trusted to

17

filter the raw evidence to the people in this case, and I

18

don't see how in a democracy that depends on the integrity

19

of its law enforcement agencies in a case where you've had

20

- well, by the way, there haven't been five

21

investigations.

22

Committee stated out the outset of its two-day hearings

23

they're not looking into whether Mr. Foster committed

24

suicide or not.

25

those pages.

For instance, the Senate Whitewater

That's in the record.

Look at ER 603 and

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So we're also looking at a situation with regard

2

to the Fiske and Starr offices using FBI agents as part of

3

their investigation, where the FBI did the initial

4

investigation with the Park Police.

5

record.

6

have FBI agents participating in an examination of what

7

they already did.

There's a conflict of interest there when you

8
9

That's all in the

So to call this five separate investigations is
highly misleading, and I think that the only investigation

10

that will matter in this case is the one that the people

11

can do directly by seeing the raw evidence for itself,

12

because for whatever reason, and I don't impugn the

13

motives of Judge Starr or anybody else, I have no personal

14

knowledge that he actually wrote the report.

15

lawyers in his office.

16

was.

He had

I don't know what the mechanics

I want to make that very, very clear.

17

I just want it to be known that we know

18

objectively, and it's undisputed, there were major pieces

19

of evidence omitted from the Fiske and Starr reports that

20

point to something other than the official conclusion, not

21

just little details, because those things, I agree, can be

22

explained sometimes.

23

issues, and those are spelled out in the brief in detail

24

for you.

25

We're talking about major, major

QUESTION: Mr. Favish, are there any other

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal statutes that use the term privacy?

2

MR. FAVISH: There is the Privacy Act enacted in

3

1974, and there is a definition which talks about

4

personally identifying details, and I don't have that at

5

hand right now, but it's consistent -

6
7

QUESTION: You don't think that covers relatives
who are deceased?

8
9

MR. FAVISH: I don't think it enacts a definition
that gives somebody a privacy interest in a document -

10

QUESTION: I don't either.

11

MR. FAVISH: - which has no information about

12

them, and I think that's indicative also.

13

point has to do with what the Ninth Circuit did here in

14

addition to the reasons I've already explained.

15

basically said that it isn't the release of the photos

16

that will cause the harm, it's what's going to be done

17

later, media intrusion and so forth, which I think

18

violates what Justice Scalia said in his concurrence in

19

the Ray case about the derivative uses.

20

And my one last

They

Now, Ray was an exemption 6 case, but it focused

21

on the word that's common to both exemptions, constitute,

22

would the release or production constitute the invasion of

23

privacy?

violates what Justice Scalia said in his concurrence in

25

Ray, with which I - I agree wholeheartedly.

What the Ninth Circuit came up with really

bound to agree with Justice Scalia's concurrence?

MR. FAVISH: I - I -

5

QUESTION: You just think they would be well

6

advised to do so.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. FAVISH: I think they would be well advised

9

to have at least noted what Justice Scalia said and

10

compare it to what they were doing, and if they had done

11

that, they would see that what they did was wrong on that

12

score.

And that's really all I have.

1

there will be little protection left for privacy.

2

And the problem won't be just that this

3

information will end up on the front page of the New York

4

Times, but under the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, if - if

5

the Government anticipates three or more requests for

6

information, we're obliged to post the information on our

7

Web sites for photographs taken after 1996 - November

whether a remand was necessary.
