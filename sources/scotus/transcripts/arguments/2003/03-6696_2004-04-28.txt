P R O C E E D I N G S
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

3

first this morning in number 03-6696, Yaser Esam

4

Hamdi vs. Donald Rumsfeld.

Mr. Dunham.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF PEITIONERS

7
8
9

MR. DUNHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner Hamdi is a citizen who has been

10

held over two years in the United States with no

11

opportunity to be heard as to the facts on which his

12

detention is based.

13

First, the Fourth Circuit wrongly prevented Hamdi in

14

this habeas proceeding from being heard as to the

15

facts of the case on grounds that allowing him to be

16

heard would interfere with executive power.

17

Mr. Hamdi makes two claims.

Second, that the Fourth Circuit erred in

18

finding even on the one-sided record that's before

19

this Court that his detention is authorized by law.

20

The historical core of habeas corpus is to challenge

21

extrajudicial executive detention.

22

violation of the separation of powers for an Article

23

III court to perform its judicial function of inquiry

24

into long-term, indefinite detention of a citizen in

25

a habeas corpus proceeding.

It cannot be a

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Quoting from INS v. St. Cyr, at its

2

historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served

3

as a means of reviewing the legality of executive

4

detention and it is in that context that its

5

protections have been strongest.

6

QUESTION:

Do we have precedents for

7

applying the writ in wartime situations to enemy

8

combatants?

9
10
11
12

MR. DUNHAM:

For aliens, yes.

And in

Quirin -QUESTION:

But for a citizen who turns out

to be an enemy combatant?

13

MR. DUNHAM:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DUNHAM:

There are two -What precedents do we look to?
There are only two precedents

16

that I'm aware of, Justice O'Connor.

17

the treatment of the American citizen saboteur spy in

18

Ex parte Quirin, and the other is Mr. Territo, in In

19

re Territo, which was a Ninth Circuit case.

20

not a case coming out of this Court.

21

The first is

It is

In our view, first off, in Territo, the ,

22

-- he was not an enemy combatant.

He was called a

23

prisoner of war in that case, but in Territo, there

24

was a full hearing by the district judge.

25

was claiming that he was not a prisoner of war, that

Territo

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

he was forced to serve.

2

citizen.

3

that he was not a voluntary combatant.

4
5

That he was an American

That he had a right to have it determined

QUESTION:

That's not the complaint, or

the allegation here, is it?

6

MR. DUNHAM:

The allegation here is that,

7

as I understand it, is that Mr. Hamdi is an enemy

8

combatant, whatever that means.

9

defined in any case.

We don't find it

We don't find it defined in any

10

statute, and it hasn't been defined by regulation or

11

by anything that's been filed in this case.

12

QUESTION:

Well, it's an English word.

13

means somebody who is combatting.

14

MR. DUNHAM:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
I assume it means someone who

16

is -- has taken up arms against the armed forces of

17

the United States.

18

to quibble about that word?

19

Isn't that -- really, do we have

MR. DUNHAM:

No.

I mean, in its ordinary

20

sense, Your Honor, you're absolutely right.

21

that's what we would take it to mean.

22

it --

23

QUESTION:

It

And

We would give

Well, if the Government's

24

right, he is an unlawful belligerent, I take it, if

25

the Government's right.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, the Government hasn't

2

claimed in this, on the record in this case, which is

3

limited to the Mobbs Declaration, it doesn't say

4

anywhere in the Mobbs Declaration that Mr. Hamdi is

5

an unlawful combatant.

6

case limited the district court's consideration to

7

that, to that affidavit, and said he could consider

8

nothing else.

9

The Fourth Circuit in this

Now, there is nothing in that declaration

10

that says that Mr. Hamdi was an unlawful combatant.

11

And getting back to Justice Scalia's point, we do

12

accord the words enemy combatant their ordinary

13

English meaning because we have nothing else to tie

14

ourselves to, and those words mean an enemy is -- an

15

enemy is a member of a hostile power or force.

16

combatant is one taking part in combat.

17

QUESTION:

And a

Well, it certainly is possible

18

that a U.S. citizen could end up fighting for the

19

enemy in a war against our country.

That's possible.

20

MR. DUNHAM:

That's happened.

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

Happening.

23

QUESTION:

And so when that individual is

24

captured then, by our country, the question is, to

25

what extent does the habeas statute apply, and if it

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

does, are the proceedings limited in some way?

2

Because of that status of being an enemy combatant?

3

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, Your Honor, I believe

4

that the -- his status is the thing that is the

5

subject of the habeas proceeding.

6

start from the premise that he is fighting against

7

our country, that's one thing.

8

saying here is that that fact is in dispute, and that

9

we ought to --

10

QUESTION:

I mean, if you

But what we are

But you could say the same

11

thing about, about noncitizen combatants.

I mean,

12

anyone captured in a war could say, you got the wrong

13

man.

14

United States, and I insist upon a judicial

15

proceeding to let me make that point.

I, in fact, was not taking up arms against the

16

Now, you surely wouldn't allow every

17

captured enemy in a war to go through a habeas

18

proceeding because he wants to challenge the fact,

19

would you?

20

MR. DUNHAM:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor -Or would you?
No.

I don't know.

I wouldn't allow every

23

person captured to go through a habeas proceeding,

24

but there is a different legal status of a U.S.

25

citizen from an enemy alien captured on a

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

battlefield.

2

They have a different status.

QUESTION:

Well, I'm still not clear what

3

you do with Justice O'Connor's question and it's

4

basically the Quirin case.

5

are an enemy combatant and you are captured.

6

your rights any different from that of a noncitizen

7

in the same status?

8
9

You are a citizen but you
Are

You haven't answered that.

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, yes.

First off, in

Quirin, we have to start with the premise that the

10

Quirin proceeding was authorized by Congress.

11

were proceeding --

12

QUESTION:

They

I'm asking you to distinguish

13

between citizen and noncitizen in the hypothetical

14

case where each are combatants against the United

15

States and are captured.

16
17

MR. DUNHAM:

Any difference?
Not in the Quirin case.

No,

Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Any difference in your view and

19

under your theory of the case that you're presenting

20

here?

21

MR. DUNHAM:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. DUNHAM:

Yes.
And what is that difference?

24

Mr. Hamdi is a citizen.

25

belligerent immunity.

That difference is that
He is not entitled to
He is subject to prosecution

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

under our laws if he was, in fact, participating in

2

taking up arms against our forces.

3

question.

4

QUESTION:

But that begs the

You mentioned, you mentioned in

5

connection with Quirin that there was a statute, and

6

I think one -- one of the defendants was alleged to

7

be a U.S. citizen.

8

-- were there regimes in prior wars for entertaining

9

the claims of people who said, I was an innocent

So I thought you were making what

10

bystander, I was indeed captured by the enemy.

11

Vietnam and World War II, were there means to

12

entertain the claims of people who said, I wasn't an

13

enemy?

14

MR. DUNHAM:

In

There were regimes then and

15

there are regimes now, but they haven't been used by

16

the military here.

17

regulations that provide for a hearing for someone

18

captured on the battlefield to determine their status

19

if there is any doubt as to their status.

There are outstanding military

20

QUESTION:

21

proceedings satisfy your claim?

22

Hamdi has not had a chance to be heard on his claim

23

that this was a dreadful mistake, I wasn't an enemy.

24
25

MR. DUNHAM:

Would those military
Your point is that

Those proceedings would go a

long way towards satisfying the process part of our

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

claim, Your Honor, but they don't really address the

2

authorization part of our claim, which we have two

3

claims here really.

4

The first is that he has never been -- had

5

an opportunity to give, to assert a claim of

6

innocence.

7

followed in this case, would certainly have given him

8

that opportunity.

9

corpus petition which would be his right, the

And those regulations, if they had been

And then if he filed a habeas

10

district judge would have had a record of a hearing

11

like he does on a -- on reviewing a state criminal

12

conviction.

13

QUESTION:

But I don't think any

14

proceeding, Mr. Dunham, conducted by the military at

15

this stage, is going to reveal much that's factual.

16

How are you going to get people, you know, if he was

17

seized on the battlefield, what evidence are you

18

going to get now from the, from those people who

19

probably don't even remember it?

20

accorded some process at that time, as I understand

21

they said they did, surely that is more reliable than

22

anything that would come up now two years later.

23

MR. DUNHAM:

If the military

Your Honor, they did not

24

provide any process as contemplated by their

25

regulations.

In fact, the district judge offered to

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

let the military take this man and give him one of

2

those hearings.

3

regulations specify.

4

QUESTION:

The very hearings their own

What would you expect the

5

military to do?

6

captured by our own forces.

7

allied forces and turned over to our forces.

8

10

As I understand it, he wasn't even

MR. DUNHAM:

He was captured by

Well, that's certainly,

certainly part of the problem, Your Honor.

We have a

strong --

11

QUESTION:

Well, you want them to run down

12

the members of the Afghan allies who captured this

13

man and get them to testify in a proceeding?

14

just putting unreasonable demands upon, upon a war

15

situation.

16

It's

I just -MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor, I don't -- my

17

view is that it can never be an unreasonable demand

18

to comply with habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment.

19

QUESTION:

That is the question --

20

QUESTION:

Are you claiming --

21

QUESTION:

-- is what it means.

And the

22

Chief Justice and Justice Scalia both indicated and

23

it concerns me, too.

Are we supposed

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

witnessed the capture?

2

MR. DUNHAM:

How does this work?
Well, the military's own

3

regulations provide a good guide for how this hearing

4

would work.

5

it can't, when it's not convenient to obtain it in

6

any other way.

7

8

We have fax machines.

10

They allow testimony by affidavit when

And we are living in an age where we

We have phones that have

You can get depositions.
QUESTION:

What if they get a deposition

11

from an American colonel who says this prisoner was

12

turned over to me by allied forces, our Afghan allies

13

in this combat, and I was assured by them that they

14

had captured him in a firefight?

15

to satisfy our habeas corpus review?

16

MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor, that would be a

17

lot more than what we have now.

18

QUESTION:

Oh, it certainly would, but you

19

wouldn't accept that, would you?

20

MR. DUNHAM:
without Mr. Hamdi --

Fundamental to -QUESTION:

So your objection is not the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

hearsay rule, your objection is the right to make

2

some kind of response.

3

claim?

4

MR. DUNHAM:

That's your basic process

That's correct, Your Honor.

5

That we have, we have never authorized detention of a

6

citizen in this country without giving him an

7

opportunity to be heard, to say, hey, I am an

8

innocent person.

9

able to say that yet.

We don't -- he hasn't even been
He hasn't been able to look at

10

the facts that have been alleged against him and give

11

any kind of an explanation as to his side of the

12

story, which may well turn out to be true and may

13

well clear up some of the deficiencies in the Mobbs

14

Declaration.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

But if this -- I'm sorry.

Go

QUESTION:

At this stage of the game, I

on.

18

take it, you have no per se objection to some form of

19

military process, so long as he could be heard?

20

MR. DUNHAM:

The only problem I would have

21

with that, Your Honor, and it's a small one, is that

22

the military has refused to give this process to him.

23

QUESTION: No, I realize that.

But

24

that's what you're -- you're asking us for something.

25

And my suggestion is, if I understand your argument,

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that if ultimately you were found, your client was

2

found to be entitled to some process, it might be,

3

consistently with your position, that military

4

process with an opportunity to be heard in response

5

would satisfy your demand.

6
7

MR. DUNHAM:

Yes.

That's correct, Your

Honor.

8

QUESTION:

All right.

9

MR. DUNHAM:

The military procedure

10

requires the military to call witnesses and allows

11

the detainee an opportunity to give his own side of

12

the story and call his own witnesses.

13

QUESTION:

Do you still think that habeas

14

is necessary in order to determine that that process

15

has been afforded him?

16

MR. DUNHAM:

17
18

Well, right now, habeas is

necessary to even get him that process.
QUESTION:

Let's assume the regime that

19

Justice Souter suggested, it's in place.

20

entitled to habeas in order to ensure that that has

21

taken place and have, have the Article III court

22

supervise that, or would affidavits that this, from

23

the Government that this procedure has been afforded

24

be satisfactory?

25

MR. DUNHAM:

You are

That would be a separate

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

habeas proceeding, Your Honor, which might be filed

2

after the hearing was held by the military, and --

3
4
5

QUESTION:

I'm asking if you are entitled

to file that as a matter of right.
MR. DUNHAM:

I believe that any U.S.

6

citizen has a right to file a habeas corpus petition

7

at any time he is detained by the government.

8

don't know that the Article III court would need to

9

supervise the military hearing if that's what he got.

But I

10

He would certainly have the right, when that hearing

11

was over, just like anybody does, to file a habeas

12

petition saying that I'm detained by the government.

13

And then the district judge could look at

14

the hearing, if there was a hearing by the military,

15

he could review it for fundamental fairness, if

16

that's what the detainee decided to do at that point.

17

But it wouldn't be --

18

QUESTION:

But it is reviewable on habeas?

19

You are not saying that it would be an adequate

20

defense in a subsequent habeas position simply to say

21

there was a hearing of the kind prescribed in the

22

military regulations, and after that hearing, he was

23

found to be an enemy combatant.

24

satisfy you?

25

re-examine the facts brought up in that hearing?

That would not

You would allow the habeas court to

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DUNHAM:

I believe that the habeas

2

court could always review the process to see that it

3

was fair.

That's a habeas court's function.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DUNHAM:

Right.
But it wouldn't be anything

6

extensive.

7

proceeding, the district judge would simply --

8
9

If there was a record from the military

QUESTION:

Well, it depends on what you

mean by fair, of course, and what, you know, what

10

common law courts usually mean by fair, for example,

11

is no hearsay testimony.

12

a wartime situation and everybody will get off.

13

MR. DUNHAM:

And you apply that rule to

Well, Your Honor, the

14

regulations, the military's own regulations say how

15

the hearing is to be held.

16

be basically looking to see whether those regulations

17
18

The district judge would

were complied with.
QUESTION:

Oh, that's different.

I

19

thought you said that he would look to see whether

20

those regulations were fair.

21

MR. DUNHAM:

Oh, no, not the regulation --

22

whether the proceeding was fair, whether it complied

23

with fundamental due process.

24
25

QUESTION:

And that would --

That's something quite

different from saying they followed the regulations.

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

The regulations might be something that a common law

2

judge thinks does not comply with due process.

3

that case, you would override the military judgment,

4

right?

5

MR. DUNHAM:

6

court has that power, Your Honor.

7

court has that power in a habeas proceeding.

8
9

QUESTION:
basic answer.

In

Well, I believe the district
The Article III

But I didn't understand your

The basic question is, in the ordinary

10

case, not some unusual case, but in the ordinary

11

case, if they set up an ordinary military tribunal

12

according to Article I(6) and it worked and so forth,

13

then isn't that due process?

14

Scalia -- in response to Justice Scalia's question,

15

you said that wouldn't satisfy you, but my impression

16

was you were saying in the ordinary case, that would

17

satisfy you.

18

MR. DUNHAM:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22

you.

I thought Justice

That's correct.
All right, it would satisfy

Fine.
MR. DUNHAM:

All I wanted to say was that

you haven't had that hearing.

23

QUESTION:

No, I understand that.

24

the second half of my question.

25

you, I take it, in one of two ways.

That's

They could satisfy
A, that they

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

have the military tribunal that they've given in

2

every war and so forth, the ordinary procedure there,

3

a neutral decision maker and an opportunity to

4

present proofs and arguments, or B, they don't do

5

that.

6
7

Now, if they refuse to do that, then what,
in your opinion, should the habeas court do?

8
9

MR. DUNHAM:

Then the habeas court should

hold a hearing that would be very similar to what the

10

military should have done.

11

to send the case back to the military to have them

12

hold the very hearing we're talking about, using

13

their own officers to do it just as the military

14

regulations require it.

15

QUESTION:

Judge Doumar here tried

But that would be a different

16

approach.

17

court has to hold the hearing that the military would

18

have held, but that the habeas court has to say to

19

the military, hold the hearing or let him go.

20

would be satisfied, I take it, if the habeas court,

21

on Justice Breyer's hypothesis, said, hold the

22

hearing.

23

I mean, it might be not that the habeas

MR. DUNHAM:

You

That would be satisfactory,

24

Your Honor, but the question is what interferes with

25

the military more, for the district judge to hold a

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

hearing that the military has previously refused to

2

do, or to order the military to follow their own

3

rules?

4

QUESTION:

Was there a reason given --

5

when the district judge suggested that solution, why

6

did the Government say, we don't want to use the

7

procedure that we used, say, in Vietnam?

8
9

MR. DUNHAM:

As I recall, the answer was

we're not required to and we don't choose to do so.

10

QUESTION:

Is that procedure -- does that

11

have -- did Congress have a part in that, the

12

military regulations that provided for how you treat

13

people in wartime situations who say, I'm innocent

14

essentially?

15
16

MR. DUNHAM: No, Congress has not passed
these rules.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Congress did pass

18

something called the Authorization for Use of

19

Military Force, did it not?

20

MR. DUNHAM:

21

QUESTION:

22

Yes, it did, Your Honor.
And it affects this very

conflict.

23

MR. DUNHAM:

QUESTION:

25

have here?

Yes, it does, Your Honor.
Now, what application does that

It appears to allow detention of people

Alderson Reporting Company

captured.

2

MR. DUNHAM:

The Authorization for Use of

3

Military Force does not have the word detention

4

anywhere in it.

5

is the equivalent, in our view, of a declaration of

6

war.

7

it would have that same operative effect.

8

history, we have never had any substantive rights

9

conveyed to the commander-in-chief by the mere act of

I mean,

certainly,

13

you know, when there is a declaration of war or a

14

resolution such as this, surely the President has the

right to kill foreign combatants, no?

MR. DUNHAM:

kill them and if they're aliens --

18
19

He certainly has the right to

QUESTION:

Now, is it conceivable that he

has to kill them but not to detain them?

20

MR. DUNHAM:

He has the right to detain

21

alien combatants, no question about it.

22

comes to U.S. citizens, you don't simply detain them.

23

You prosecute them, like they did with John Walker

24

Lindh.

25

QUESTION:

But when it

You're saying that AMUF is

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

insufficient in this case to detain, because

2

declarations of war and the AMUF historically have

3

simply authorized the President to use his judgment

4

and his force and his capacities and his power

5

without having an extensive list of the different

6

things that he can do.

7

something quite different, it seems to me.

8
9

MR. DUNHAM:

And you're asking for

Well, in the War of 1812,

there was a general declaration of war but Congress

10

still passed a list of specific things the President

11

could do.

12

give the President the power to appropriate funds to

13

fight the war.

14

Obviously a declaration of war doesn't

QUESTION:

No, but look, it does say in

15

this authorization, the President is authorized to

16

use all necessary and appropriate force against

17

persons he determines planned, authorized, committed

18

or aided the terrorist attacks.

19

MR. DUNHAM:

If that is interpreted to

20

mean that he can impose indefinite executive

21

detention on anybody that he thinks is necessary in

22

order to fulfill that command, we could have people

23

locked up all over the country tomorrow without any

24

due process, without any opportunity to be heard,

25

because we know that this war that we're talking

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

about here is going on worldwide and it's going on

2

within our own borders.

3

Congress didn't intend to -- when it

4

passed this Authorization for Use of Military Force

5

to authorize widespread detentions of people with no

6

opportunity to be heard, indefinite, solitary

7

confinement for as long as they might live.

8

-- there is no indication that Congress intended any

9

such thing.

10

QUESTION:

Congress

Did Congress intend that the

11

President has the authority and the right to use

12

whatever powers are necessary to suppress the

13

terrorists and to prevent future attacks, consistent

14

with the traditions and the powers of that office?

15

MR. DUNHAM:

I believe they authorize it

16

consistent with our laws.

17

repealed any laws when they wrote the Authorization

18

for Use of Military Force.

19

QUESTION:

I don't think Congress

Mr. Dunham, can I ask you sort

20

of a preliminary question.

21

down the road now, but do you contest any of the

22

facts in the Mobbs Declaration?

23

MR. DUNHAM:

We're talking about way

Well, I've only recently been

24

allowed to talk to my client, Your Honor, and

25

everything he has told me they tell me is classified,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

so I'm not allowed to convey it to the Court this

2

morning.

3

general way, there is a substantial dispute.

4

But the best I can say is in an overall

QUESTION:

There is a substantial dispute,

5

and have you had an opportunity, on behalf of the

6

client, to supplement or to contradict or supplement

7

the information in the Mobbs Declaration?

8
9

MR. DUNHAM:

No, because it's -- it's

while the matter has been pending before this Court

10

and there is no way to go before the Court at this

11

point, absent a remand, in order to do that.

12

Court remanded, I would be able to do that provided

13

that we had appropriate protective orders in place so

14

that I could convey classified information to the

15

Court.

16

QUESTION:

If the

Mr. Dunham, one of the judges

17

on the Fourth Circuit in the en banc denial, Judge

18

Motz, had a proposal that was similar to the one that

19

Judge Mukasey proposed in New York.

20

initially, the Mobbs affidavit is taken as true but

21

that you have an opportunity to rebut it.

22

be a satisfactory -- would that comport with due

23

process?

24
25

And that is,

Would that

In your view?
MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor, that is the way

the statutory habeas proceeding is supposed to

we're before the court on a petition for habeas

12

what should happen.

13

Habeas corpus statutes are still on the

QUESTION:

So every United States citizen,

14

even if captured on the field of combat, is

15

entitled to a habeas hearing?

16

MR. DUNHAM:

That of course assumes he's

17

captured on the field of combat, Your Honor, which we

18

don't concede.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that's right.

He's

20

entitled to a habeas hearing to determine whether in

21

fact he was captured on the field of combat opposing

22

the United States, right?

23
24
25

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, if he files a petition

for habeas corpus, yes.
QUESTION:

And I presume that anybody who

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

claims to be an American citizen would be entitled to

2

a habeas hearing on the question of whether he is in

3

fact an American citizen, and then the subsequent

4

question of whether he was captured on the field of

5

combat while taking up arms against the

6

United States, right?

7

MR. DUNHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, the military -So every foreigner captured, if

he claims to be an American citizen, would be

entitled to the kind of habeas hearing you're talking

about?

asking us to adopt and how it would apply.

if there is a habeas corpus right for an American

24

citizen, there has to be, it seems to me, a habeas

25

corpus right for everyone who claims he is an

Your Honor, that may be the

case but that doesn't justify taking away the habeas

doesn't justify taking away a citizen's right because

You can't say that with that

would like to save the balance of my time for

Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.

18

ORAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL D. CLEMENT

19

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

20
21
22

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Petitioners contend that the Government

23

categorically lacks the authority to hold Hamdi as an

24

enemy combatant.

25

and long established that the Government has the

But it has been well established

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

authority to hold both unlawful enemy combatants and

2

lawful prisoners of war captured on the battlefield

3

in order to prevent them from returning to the

4

battle.

5

Over 10,000 United States troops remain on

6

the field of battle in Afghanistan.

7

law or logic requires the United States to release an

8

individual from detention so that he can rejoin the

9

battle against the United States.

10

QUESTION:

No principle of

But the question of whether

11

it's a criminal procedure or this detention without

12

-- does the Government have any rhyme or rationale as

13

to why some of these people -- I think Mr. Dunham

14

mentioned Lindh, there is also Moussaoui, there is

15

this John -- they are also being kept away from

16

returning any place because there are criminal

17

charges against them.

18

And then there is Hamdi and Padilla and

19

al-Marri who are in this detention state with no

20

charges.

21

Government justify some going through the criminal

22

process and others just being held indefinitely?

23

What does the Government -- how does the

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I think

24

that reflects a sound exercise of prosecutorial and

25

executive discretion.

There are some individuals who

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

may be captured in a situation where they do not

2

have any particular intelligence value, they have

3

been handled in a way where there are no difficult

4

evidentiary questions that would be raised in a

5

criminal prosecution and those individuals can be

6

dealt with in the Article III system.

7

But there are plenty of individuals who

8

either have a paramount intelligence value that

9

putting them into the Article III system immediately

10

and providing them with counsel whose first advice

11

would certainly be to not talk to the Government is a

12

counterproductive way to proceed in these cases.

13

QUESTION:

At the moment, nobody --

14

QUESTION:

I'm trying to find whether

15

there is any literature or commentary on how long the

16

detention is required before the intelligence value,

17

the interrogation value of the custody serves no

18

further purpose.

19

outer bounds of how long the detention would take in

20

order to get the value from the interrogation that

21

you want?

22

Can you give me any ideas of the

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm

23

not sure I can give you the outer bounds, but what I

24

can say is that the case here before you today in

25

Hamdi, and the case in Padilla, suggests that the

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

amount of time that is necessary to allow for

2

interrogation without access to counsel in order to

3

get intelligence is not an indefinite period of time.

4

Both these individuals now have access to

5

counsel because the military intelligence experts who

6

make these judgments have made the judgment that

7

access to counsel at this point does not interfere

8

with the intelligence gathering process.

9

QUESTION:

Would it be --

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, how can you

QUESTION:

Would it be a helpful line of

11

assume --

12
13

inquiry for a district court, assuming that there is

14

some jurisdiction in the district court, which you

15

would contest, to have testimony as to how effective

16

interrogations are and how long it takes.

17

we could begin to get some understanding of this

18

process?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

And then

I suppose you could.

One

20

thing I would point you to, Justice Kennedy, is the

21

declaration of Vice Admiral Jacoby, who is the director

22

of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

That's at page 75 of

23
24
25

the Joint Appendix in the Padilla case.
And I think that -- there obviously are

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

various ways the courts could approach this.

A court

2

in one proceeding could take evidence of the question

3

generally.

4

which there was a habeas petition filed and there was

5

an initial period where there was no access to

6

counsel, if a judge for some reason thought that that

7

had taken too long, I suppose that judge could make

8

an inquiry of the Government, and in an ex parte

9

proceeding, they could make some kind of filing

I suppose if there were a situation in

10

explaining to the judge why it is that further

11

interrogation without counsel is necessary.

12

I think the important thing is twofold.

13

One, to recognize that there is a unique interest,

14

especially in the course of this conflict, where

15

intelligence is at unprecedented value, to have some

16

ability with some detainees to deal with them in a

17

way that allows us to get intelligence to prevent

18

future terrorist attacks, and not be limited just to

19

going after them retrospectively for past terrorist

20

attacks.

21

QUESTION:

We can accept that, but what do

22

you, what do you make of Section 4001.

I take it

23

it's the Government's position that it has absolutely

24

no application to the situation.

25

refers to the normal circumstances of the criminal

That it simply

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

law.

Is that right?
MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice

3

Souter, but I would be quick to add that we -- I

4

mean, all 4001(a) says is that an individual must be

5

detained pursuant to an act of Congress.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DUNHAM:

Right.
If one needs an act of

8

Congress, and we question whether this really has

9

anything to do with the detention of enemy combatants

10

by the military, but to the extent an act of Congress

11

is necessary, as I think Justice O'Connor's questions

12

indicated, the Authorization of Force provides more

13

than ample statutory --

14

QUESTION:

It certainly did -- may I just

15

ask one more question?

16

least for the sake of argument that it did in the, in

17

the early stages of the period starting with

18

September 11th.

19

argument that it did when it was passed.

20

I will concede certainly at

I will assume for the sake of

It doesn't follow, however, that it is

21

adequate for all time.

The fact is, I will assume

22

that on September 12th, without any authorization

23

from Congress at all, the President could have taken

24

action in relation to this individual, I mean, if he

25

had been fighting on a battlefield that the President

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

took.
But it doesn't follow that the President's

3

authority to do that is indefinite for all time.

And

4

I guess the question I would be interested in and

5

your response to is this.

6

that the, that the authorization was sufficient at

7

the time that it was passed, but that at some point,

8

it is a Congressional responsibility, and ultimately

9

a constitutional right on this person's part, for

Is it reasonable to think

10

Congress to assess the situation and either pass a

11

more specific continuing authorization or at least to

12

come up with the conclusion that its prior

13

authorization was good enough.

14

some point have a responsibility to do more than pass

15

that resolution?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Doesn't Congress at

Well, Justice Souter, I

17

would say a couple of things.

18

some difficult questions down the road, but if there

19

is emphasis that 10,000 United States troops remain

20

on the battlefield in Afghanistan --

21

QUESTION:

One is there may be

Well, there are 10,000 troops

22

there, but it's two and a half years later.

And it

23

may very well be that the, that the constitutional

24

obligation and the constitutional demand that his

25

client can make is that the political branch take

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

a -- make a further assessment and a more specific

2

one.

3

but there has also been time.

I'm not denying that there is a lot going on,

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I realize that, Justice

5

Souter.

6

have time, I'd come back to the 10,000 troops still

7

on the ground.

8

open with whatever appropriate recesses every day

9

since September 18th, 2001 when they passed the joint

10
11

Let me say one other thing.

And then if I

What I would say is Congress has been

resolution.
If they were to pass some specific statute

12

that either provided for more finely reticulated

13

procedures for dealing with enemy combatants or tried

14

to preclude the detention of certain individuals,

15

then I think one of two things would happen, either

16

the executive branch would follow those more

17

reticulated provisions, or I suppose if there was a

18

judgment by Congress that this authority was denied

19

all together and the President thought that that

20

authority was absolutely necessary to the fighting of

21

the battle in Afghanistan, then you might have a

22

situation where we came to this Court in a situation

23

that Justice Jackson would say the executive's power

24

is at its lowest ebb.

25

But here we come to the Court with that

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

authorization that the President relied on.

2

QUESTION:

You come with an authorization

3

that the President relied on and which I will assume

4

he quite rightly relied on at the time it was passed.

5

But my question is a timing question.

6

reasonable to at least consider whether that

7

resolution needs, at this point, to be supplemented

8

and made more specific to authorize what you are

9

doing?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Is it not

Well, again, Justice Souter,

11

I can't imagine that the rule is that the executive

12

somehow suffers if Congress doesn't fill the breach.

13

Because the last word from Congress is that -- that

14

all necessary and appropriate force is authorized.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Yes, but when you say the

executive suffers, I think your response is assuming that
the

18

executive has the power.

19

that the executive has power in the early exigencies

20

of an emergency.

21

indefinite future, the other political branch has got

22

to act if that, if power is to continue.

23

And it may very well be

But that at some point in the

MR. CLEMENT:

But Justice Souter, they

24

have authorized the use of force.

Without any specific reference

to this situation, without any specific reference to

3

keeping American citizens detained indefinitely.

4

mean, that's the problem.

5

QUESTION:

I

Mr. Clement, this Section 4001

6

doesn't relate to a hearing, it relates to the

7

President's power to detain, doesn't it?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

QUESTION:

Well, absolutely.

So if it expires after two and

10

a half years, it would just not mean you have to give

11

them counsel after two and a half years or give them

12

a hearing after two and a half years.

13

would have to let them go back to Afghanistan after

14

two and a half years, wouldn't it?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CLEMENT:

It means you

It would, Justice Scalia --

It would, but it uses -And that's why I find it so

talking about the military itself recognizing that

basic principle with tribunals in what is called Army

8

person says I am not a combatant, I was a relief

Now, is there any reason why, when a

10

worker, I wasn't even there, I was sold into this by

11

people who wanted a bounty, is there any reason why

12

you could not have that kind of proceeding, the kind

13

of proceeding that was given in the Gulf War on the

14

battlefield in hundreds of instances, that was given

15

in Iraq in hundreds of instances, the kind of

16

proceeding that the military itself has given over

17

and over and over.

18

Now, is there any reason why that isn't

19

necessary and appropriate, or why that isn't in

20

accordance with law or due process of law?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, let me say

22

several things.

One is that the regulations that are

23

being bandied about are the regulations that the Army

24

uses to comply with their obligations under Article V

25

of the Geneva Convention.

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, Article V of the Geneva Convention

2

does not apply here, and let me address why in a

3

minute, but let me say very clearly that these

4

individuals have gotten military process.

5

not have been the exact process --

6

QUESTION:

It might

That wasn't the question I

7

asked.

The question I asked, is there any reason why

8

the Army itself could not give a comparable basic

9

proceeding where you have a neutral decision maker,

10

and a practical, but fair opportunity to present

11

proofs and arguments?

12

battlefield, something two years later, not some kind

13

of thing where you haul in witnesses, but something

14

that's practical insofar as you get evidence that's

15

reasonably available.

Not some kind of thing on the

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17

QUESTION:

18

don't want a -- yes.

19

Well, Justice Breyer --

I want a practical answer.

MR. CLEMENT:

I understand that.

I

But the

20

practical answer that you are looking for assumes a

21

process that's never been provided.

22

been a process that's removed from the battlefield.

23

What Article V provides and what the military

24

regulations provide is immediately adjunct to the

25

battlefield, you have three military officers who do

There has never

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

a very quick hearing, the purpose of which primarily

2

is to figure out not whether somebody is completely

3

innocent, but to figure out whether they are properly

4

classified as a prisoner of war, as opposed to an

5

unlawful enemy combatant.

6
7

QUESTION:

So you say the regulations in

place provide for that battlefield type review?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

QUESTION:

10

They do, Justice O'Connor --

Did this Petitioner have that

type of review?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

This Petitioner, Justice

12

O'Connor, did not get that precise type of review,

13

and the reason is because, based on a Presidential

14

determination, the military officers understood that

15

Article V of the Geneva Convention has no application

16

here.

17

--

18

Again, that provision, and I think it's worth

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps not, but we are

19

here on habeas.

20

entitled to bring a habeas action?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

Do you agree that, that he is

We do agree that he is

entitled to bring a --

23

QUESTION:

Okay.

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

QUESTION:

-- habeas action.

So then we have to decide then

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

to what is he entitled, and even that minimal review

2

by the military, you think, is not required?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think it's

4

required, especially in a situation like this, where

5

although Hamdi did not receive an Article V hearing

6

because it was inapplicable, he did receive military

7

process.

8

United States forces by the Northern Alliance, our

9

military allies, there was a screening process on the

When he was originally turned over to the

10

ground in Afghanistan.

11

out 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody.

12

received that process.

13

Now, that process screened
So he

Now, to be sure, it's a military process,

14

but it is the kind of process that prisoners of war

15

and enemy combatants have always gotten.

16

because of the nature of this war, Hamdi got

17

additional process.

18

that this Article V process that other prisoners of

19

war traditionally get is a one-shot deal.

20

off the battlefield and that's it.

21

detention for the remainder of the battle.

22

there's no reason for Congress to have to go in with

23

a new resolution.

24

the war.

25

Now,

And it's important to point out

It's done

You are under
And

You are there for the remainder of

Now, in this context, because we recognize

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that there are some unusual aspects of this war, and

2

also because the United States military has no

3

interest in detaining any individual who is not an

4

enemy combatant or who does not present a continuing

5

threat, when Hamdi got to Guantanamo, he was given

6

additional screening processes.

7

as well.

That screened him in

Did not screen him out.

8

Then it may not seem what you think of as

9

traditional due process in an Article III sense, but

10

the interrogation process itself provides an

11

opportunity for an individual to explain that this

12

has all been a mistake.

13

in the record here shows --

14
15

QUESTION:

And as the affidavit that's

Do you say he had that

opportunity?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice

17

O'Connor.

18

represents, by Mr. Mobbs, that the interrogation

19

process, in that process, his story confirmed that he

20

was on the battlefield and surrendered with the

21

Taliban military unit while armed.

22

And the affidavit that's filed here

QUESTION:

Do you concede that you have

23

the obligation to make the representation that you

24

have just made to the habeas court?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kennedy, I'm not

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

positive what the ultimate minimum that the habeas

2

statutes would require in this context, but we do

3

think that an appropriate balance of individual

4

rights, the traditional role of habeas, that the

5

overwhelming military imperatives of this situation

6

are that the habeas corpus writ is available, first

7

to make legal challenges to the detention along the

8

lines of 4001(a) categorically precludes this, and

9

those challenges have been open.

10

We also think it appropriate for the

11

United States to come in with a declaration that

12

explains the basis for the military's decision.

13

particularly, I think what it does is it provides an

14

explanation that if believed, provides a basis for a

15

court to police the line that separates Quirin on the

16

one hand from Milligan on the other.

17

And

And obviously, a situation like this with

18

a battlefield detainee who surrendered while armed on

19

the battlefield is a classic case of an enemy

20

combatant.

21

QUESTION:

Is there any --

22

QUESTION:

In Quirin, in Quirin, the

23

defendants were heard, and that's -- the Mobbs

24

affidavit is, I take it your position is, yes,

25

habeas, and yes, the Government has to come forward

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

with something.

2

with is the Mobbs affidavit, which is hearsay,

3

because Mobbs doesn't know what happened on the

4

battlefield either.

5

at any point from Hamdi, although the claim before us

6

is that he would dispute what's in the Mobbs

7

affidavit, but he doesn't have an opportunity to do

8

that.

9

And the something they came forward

And that there is no statement

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

10

mean, there actually is, I mean, it would be

11

something like double hearsay, but there is a

12

statement in the Mobbs declaration itself where Mobbs

13

is summarizing that Hamdi himself --

14
15

QUESTION:
double hearsay.

16
17

Yes, but that certainly is

MR. CLEMENT:

It certainly is, but this

is --

18

QUESTION:

The person who is locked up,

19

doesn't he have a right to bring before some tribunal

20

himself his own words, rather than have a Government

21

agent say what was told to him that somebody else

22

said.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

24

Ginsburg, he has an opportunity to explain it in his

25

own words.

Now, it may not --

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

During interrogation?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CLEMENT:

During interrogation.

I mean, is that your point?
During interrogation.

5

During the initial screening.

6

in Guantanamo.

7

QUESTION:

During the screening

How about to a neutral decision

8

maker of some kind, perhaps in the military?

9

so extreme that it should not be required?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that

No, Justice O'Connor.

And

11

let me say two things.

12

screening criteria are applied in the field, for all

13

intents and purposes, that is a neutral decision

14

maker.

15

One is when the initial

I mean, as I said before, the Army is not

16

interested in holding people as enemy combatants that

17

don't qualify for that and don't pose a threat.

18

second thing I would say, though, is that as I

19

understand it, the plan on a going-forward basis

20

reflecting the unique situation of this battle is to

21

provide individuals like Hamdi, like Padilla, with

22

the equivalent of the annual review process that's

23

laid out in the briefs --

24
25

QUESTION:
just a moment.

The

Well, let's talk about that for

What is it that the Government is

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

saying will be provided?

2
3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice O'Connor,

those regulations are still in draft form.

4

QUESTION:

So we don't know?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

We don't know for sure.

6

think what's envisioned is an opportunity to go

7

before a neutral tribunal, some opportunity to

8

present --

9
10

QUESTION:

I

Yes, but Mr. Clement, you're

assuming he has no right to counsel, aren't you?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, what we're

12

assuming is that he has no right to counsel that is

13

automatic and as of right --

14

QUESTION:

If he could get his own

15

counsel, would he be entitled to consult with his

16

counsel during the preliminary stages of his

17

detention?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Not at the preliminary

19

stages if the Government has made a determination

20

that access to counsel would interfere with the

21

intelligence gathering process.

22

QUESTION:

Are there any cases -- it

23

sounds from your argument that the principle

24

interests that the Government wants to advance is the

25

ability to interrogate the person for a sufficient

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

length of time to determine whether they get valuable

2

information out of them or not.

3

And to deny him counsel during that

4

period, because he may not be as willing to talk.

5

Now, it seems to me there are two things about that I

6

wanted to ask you about.

7

the possibility that perhaps a lawyer would have

8

explained to this man that if you do give some

9

information, you won't have to stay here

One, have you considered

10

incommunicado for two or three years?

11

a motivation to talk.

12

That might be

That's one possibility.

And the second thing I want to ask you

13

about, are there any cases in the international field

14

or the law anywhere, explaining that the interest in

15

detaining a person incommunicado for a long period of

16

time for the purpose of obtaining information from

17

them is a legitimate justification?

18

I understand for arresting on the

19

battlefield, that's perfectly clear.

20

prolonged detention for that purpose the subject of

21

judicial writing anywhere that you know about?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

But is this

Let me answer both parts of

23

your question, Justice Stevens.

Certainly it has

24

occurred to us and we have considered the possibility

25

that in some circumstances with some individuals, the

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

best way to get them to cooperate and provide

2

information is to give them a lawyer who will tell

3

them, boy, you know, it's in your best interest to

4

plead to this relatively minor material support

5

charge or whatever and provide the Government with

6

everything that you have.

7

And that is part of the answer to

8

Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, is why is it

9

that there is this pattern that you look at and some

10

people are used in the Article III system and other

11

people are prosecuted or dealt with in preventative

12

detention in the military system.

13

And it reflects a judgment by people whose

14

job it is to make these judgments that certain

15

people, the best way to get them to cooperate, or

16

maybe with certain individuals after you've gotten a

17

certain amount of information from them, but you feel

18

there is one other area you're not going to get

19

unless the dynamic fundamentally changes, those

20

people may be best dealt with in the way that you

21

envisioned.

22

that the judgment of the intelligence experts had to

23

deal with them is to provide them without counsel and

24

to use an interrogation.

25

Whereas other individuals, the only way

I think to get to your second part of the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

question, I don't know that there are any authorities

2

that I'm aware of that address exactly what you're

3

talking about, but I think there are two types of

4

authority that we would point to as being very

5

important.

6

that one of the major justifications for the

7

detention of enemy combatants or prisoners of war is

8

to gather intelligence.

9

that effect in the brief.

10

First of all, it's long been recognized

And we cite some sources to

The second thing, and I think this is

11

important, is that it has never been the case that

12

prisoners of war are entitled to counsel to challenge

13

their capture or their detention.

14

historically, and what the Geneva Convention

15

provides, is that if one of those enemy combatants is

16

charged with a specific war crime, then at that point

17

they're entitled to counsel.

18

being held in a preventative detention, then in that

19

circumstance, they are not entitled to counsel.

20

QUESTION:

What has happened

But if they are just

But have we ever had a

21

situation like this where presumably this status --

22

war-like status could last for 25 years, 50 years,

23

whatever it is.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:
Justice O'Connor.

A couple of responses,

First of all, in the midst of any

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

war, the detention may seem like it's indefinite

2

because if you talk about a detainee in 1942, they're

3

not going to know how long World War II is going to

4

last.

5

those detentions have always been approved under the

6

law of war.

And their detention may seem indefinite but

7

Second, with respect to Al Qaeda and

8

individuals who are hard core Al Qaeda operatives,

9

the end of the war is a very difficult thing to

10

perceive.

11

captured on the battlefield with the Taliban, this

12

war may eventually -- the executive may make the

13

judgment or Congress may help us make the judgment

14

that the war in Afghanistan is effectively over.

15

But with respect to somebody who is

And individuals who only really posed a

16

danger of rejoining the battle in Afghanistan would

17

be released.

18

who, as I say, are hard core Al Qaeda operatives and

19

they're going to join the battle against the

20

United States wherever it's waged.

21

Afghanistan because that's where the action is.

22

Now, there may be a few individuals

QUESTION:

They're just in

May I ask just one other

23

question, I think it's just relevant.

But do you

24

think there is anything in the law that curtails the

25

method of interrogation that may be employed?

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. CLEMENT:
Justice Stevens.

Well, I think there is,

I mean --

3

QUESTION:

And what is that?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, just to give one

5

example, I think that the United States is signatory

6

to conventions that prohibit torture and that sort of

7

thing.

8

treaty obligations.

9

mentioning of course --

10

And the United States is going to honor its

QUESTION:

The other thing that's worth

But you said something about

11

self-executing.

12

Convention, you said, well, it's not self-executing.

13

Would you say the same thing about the torture

14

convention?

15

In connection with the Geneva

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I actually

16

have the sense that the torture victims -- you have

17

the Torture Victim Protection Act, of course, which I

18

think doesn't actually apply to the United States.

19

So I'm not sure that there would be any other basis

20

for bringing a private cause of action against the

21

United States.

22

But as this Court noted in footnote 14 of

23

the Eisentrager opinion, the idea that a treaty is

24

going to be enforced through means other than a

25

private cause of action doesn't mean that it's not a

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

binding treaty, doesn't mean that it's not going to

2

constrain the actions of the executive branch.

3

Just to finish up my answer to Justice

4

Stevens' question, I wouldn't want there to be any

5

misunderstanding about this.

6

of those involved in this process that the last thing

7

you want to do is torture somebody or try to do

8

something along those lines.

9

It's also the judgment

I mean, if there were an artificial -- if

10

you did that, you might get information more quickly,

11

but you would really wonder about the reliability of

12

the information you were getting.

13

the people who do this as their responsibility is

14

that the way you would get the best information from

15

individuals is that you interrogate them, you try to

16

develop a relationship of trust.

17

QUESTION:

So the judgment of

But doesn't the Court have some

18

business intervening at some point, if it's the

19

Hundred Years War or something?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, I

21

mean, there may be a point where, depending on the

22

nature of the war -- I mean, I'm not quite sure what

23

you have in mind that they would intervene on.

24
25

QUESTION:

At some point, if you're

holding people without a lawyer, with the only

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

neutral decision maker being an interrogator, with no

2

opportunity to present proofs and evidence, with no

3

opportunity to hear the other side, in your opinion,

4

if that goes on and on, let's say it's the Hundred

5

Years War, is there no opportunity for a court, in

6

your view, to say that this violates, for an American

7

citizen, the elementary due process that the

8

Constitution guarantees?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, as I indicated

10

earlier, Justice Breyer, the courts remain open.

11

recognize the viability of the writ of habeas corpus.

12

There certainly is a challenge that can be brought to

13

the length of the detention at some point.

14

courts would be open to hear claims --

15

QUESTION:

We

And the

But your answer to Justice

16

O'Connor, I thought, was, we don't have to worry or a

17

court should not be worrying about the indefiniteness

18

of the time because it may well be that the President

19

or Congress will at some point say the war in

20

Afghanistan is no longer a matter of concern and,

21

therefore, we don't have to hold the Hamdis.

22

I think that's the only answer that you

23

have given so far to Justice Breyer's question and

24

Justice O'Connor's question.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Am I wrong?

Justice Souter, a couple of

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

points.

2

contradiction with that and my answer to Justice

3

Breyer's question.

4

situation where the evidence in the Government's own

5

affidavit shows that somebody is only detained with

6

regard to war in Afghanistan.

7

imagine that that has been signed, sealed and

8

delivered, it's over, the President says so, Congress

9

says so and there is an effort to continue to detain

10
11

One is, I don't think there is any

I mean, you can imagine a

And then you can

that individual.
QUESTION:

I can imagine it and I can also

12

imagine that the concern about Afghanistan will go on

13

as long as there is concern about Al Qaeda, and there

14

is no endpoint that we can see at this point to that.

15

So that it seems to me your answer boils down to

16

saying, don't worry about the timing question, we'll

17

tell you when it's over.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

19

Souter, I continue to think that there may be a role

20

for the courts in dealing with the timing question at

21

some point.

22

I think that would be --

QUESTION:

I'm taking away from the

23

argument the impression, and please correct me if I'm

24

wrong, that you think there is a continuing role for

25

the courts to examine the reasonableness of the

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

period of detention.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I wouldn't take that

3

away, Justice Kennedy.

What I'm saying is there is a

4

continuing but modest role for the courts.

5

habeas courts will remain open.

6

of one of Justice Souter's questions is that it's

7

already too long and if somebody raised that claim,

8

if there is another petition filed, a direct petition

9

now that Hamdi has counsel that's filed in this

The

I mean, the import

10

claim, and that claim is raised, we would be in court

11

vehemently saying there is no role for the habeas

12

court there.

There are troops still on the ground in

13

Afghanistan.

It makes no sense whatsoever to release

14

an individual detained as an enemy combatant in

15

Afghanistan while the troops are still on the ground

16

in Afghanistan.

17

QUESTION:

But it may make every bit of

18

sense to have an opportunity on the part of that

19

individual, before someone other than an

20

interrogator, to say, I am not the kind of person

21

that they claim I am on the basis of which they are

22

holding me.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, again --

The alternative is not give him

some kind of a hearing or release him.

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

No, but the alternative is

2

to provide a means of allowing for a military process

3

to go forward.

It's not just the interrogator.

It's

4

the original screening team on the ground in

5

Afghanistan that, as I said before, released 10,000

6

individuals out of U.S. custody.

7

team in Guantanamo and then it is this annual review

8

process that will go forward.

9

tremendous amount of process that the executive

10

branch is providing.

11

QUESTION:

12

It's the screening

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.

20

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

21

MR. DUNHAM:

May it please the Court.

22

Mr. Clement is a worthy advocate and he can stand up

23

here and make the unreasonable sound reasonable.

24

when you take his argument at core, it is, "Trust

25

us."

And who is saying trust us?

But

The executive

branch.

And why do we have the great writ?

2

the great writ because we didn't trust the executive

3

branch when we founded this Government.

4

the Government is saying trust us is no excuse for

5

taking away and driving a truck through the right of

6

habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment that no man

7

shall be deprived of liberty except upon due process

The Congress needs to act here.

Justice

Souter was on point when he was talking about the

fact that we're two years into this thing and

Congress leaves all the laws on the books that relate

to habeas corpus and how a habeas corpus proceeding

Congress tomorrow could take these

military regs and they could say, this is the law, we

13

authorize the executive to detain people and to give

14

them hearings the way the military says, and then it

15

would be lawful.

16

But Congress hasn't done that and I

17

respectfully submit, Your Honors, that until Congress

18

does act, these detentions are not lawful.

would respectfully ask this Court to step up to the

plate and say so.
