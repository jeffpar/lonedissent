CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

v. Z.J. Gifts.

Mr. Nathan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ANDREW NATHAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. NATHAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case presents the narrow issue of the

12

judicial review appropriate for a license denial under

13

Littleton's ordinance where clear, objective standards

14

guide the city's quick and guaranteed decision to grant or

15

deny a license and render that decision subject to

16

effective review in the courts.

17

As FW/PBS has made clear, none of the three

18

risks the Court has articulated to justify the

19

extraordinary remedy of a mandated judicial deadline exist

20

here.

21

drawing between protected and unprotected speech; self­

22

censorship stemming from a censored decision that speech

23

is not protected; and foot-dragging when the government is

24

the plaintiff seeking to vindicate its decision to censor.

25

Those risks are:

the government will err in line­

Instead, where the decision to grant or deny a

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

license for expressive activity is bounded by valid time,

2

place, and manner considerations, this Court has held that

3

certiorari review is appropriate.

4

alleged risk here that the city clerk will violate the

5

ordinance when it requires a granting of a license is not

6

a risk that flows from the language of the licensing

7

standards at all, but rather a refusal to apply those

8

objective standards.

9

QUESTION:

That is because the

In short -­
Mr. Nathan, would you explain to me

10

how this generally operates with adult shops?

In the -­

11

in the film context, the film can't be shown.

These were

12

in the old days when they had censor boards.

So there was

13

a great impetus to have quick action.

14

But here, I take it that the business was up and

15

running and it was the city that said you need a license.

16

And my question is, do these questions -- does the

17

business start first and the city come in and say you need

18

a license, or do -- does the entrepreneur wait until -­

19

and -- and apply for a license before starting up in

20

business?

21

MR. NATHAN:

Typically the latter, Your Honor.

22

The entrepreneur would apply for a license and, assuming

23

it is granted, would then start the business.

24
25

QUESTION:

So this is an atypical case where the

business was running and the city came in and said, you

1

need a license?

2

MR. NATHAN:

This is a case where a business

3

started and filed litigation at the same time as it

4

started against the city in Federal court.

5

QUESTION:

I suppose the city could have sought

6

to enjoin the operation of the business until it got the

7

license.

8

could have.

9
10

MR. NATHAN:

QUESTION:

The

The Freedman case seemed to require

prompt judicial determination, didn't it?

13

MR. NATHAN:

QUESTION:

15

The city -- yes, Your Honor.

city did do that.

11
12

It didn't in this case, I take it, but they

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

And it's your position that the

subsequent case involving PBS changed that standard?

16

MR. NATHAN:

In the licensing context, a

17

requirement of a prompt judicial decision we believe is

18

unnecessary and that's what FW/PBS held.

20

QUESTION:

Well, that surprises me to hear.

didn't know that's what we had done.

MR. NATHAN:

Well, the decision mentioned the

22

availability of judicial review as the second Freedman

23

standard.

I

QUESTION:

What -- what about the proposal some

of the States have made whereby a provisional license

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

could be given pending the eventual judicial

2

determination?

3

MR. NATHAN:

The problem with the provisional

4

license is twofold.

5

effects that the licensing ordinance seeks to prevent

6

while the provisional license is granted.

7

would allow the business to drag its feet in court,

8

whereas a business that needs a license has every

9

incentive to pursue that.

10

QUESTION:

First, it would allow the secondary

And second, it

Well, if -- if there's a danger of

11

delay in litigation that -- that both parties fear -- and

12

apparently you feared -- isn't that all the more reason

13

that before you have a license which restricts the

14

publication of allegedly lawful speech, that you should

15

have a -- a system for prompt judicial determination?

16

MR. NATHAN:

But where you have an ordinance,

17

Your Honor, that does not deal directly with speech, has

18

separate objective licensing standards that do not have

19

anything to do with speech, the government does not bear

20

the burden of going to court first.

21

the court should be able to determine if -- readily from a

22

record that's created by the administrative process as to

23

whether or not the decision to deny the license is a

24

subterfuge to deny speech.

25

is -- is that a mandated judicial remedy would require

But more importantly,

2

3

denial.

4

incorrect.

5

They're just claiming that the denial is

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I -- you could -- if we're

6

sitting here drafting a model ordinance, which is of

7

course part of the problem that I'm presented with so far

8

as the respondents are concerned, but if you're -- if

9

we're trying to envisage a model ordinance, just account

10

for that contingency, saying our prompt judicial

11

determination procedure applies only if there's a First

12

Amendment claim.

13

MR. NATHAN:

But I guess the question goes back

14

to whether or not the risks justify imposing a mandated

15

judicial deadline.

16

QUESTION:

How serious is the burden?

There are

17

now a few circuits that have said that prompt judicial

18

resolution, not merely access, is required.

19

the Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth.

20

resolution there?

21

I think it's

What has been the

What have cities done?

MR. NATHAN:

Well, cities have been groping for

22

a solution to that question.

In Colorado, we would have a

23

separation of powers issue.

24

engraft in Littleton's ordinance a requirement that courts

25

that it does not control rule within a set period of time.

It's very difficult to

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Some of the cities have attempted to pass legislation.

2

Some have attempted to create their own court systems.

3

None of those is guaranteed to work and none of them are,

4

we believe, mandated by the risks entailed.

5

QUESTION:

Do any of the courts which have said

6

that prompt disposition, rather than just access -- have

7

they gone on to say that prompt appellate disposition,

8

because presumably you can appeal from the ruling of -- of

9

a superior court or a trial court, that that also is

10
11

required?
MR. NATHAN:

I do not believe they have held

12

that, Your Honor.

13

to exactly how that is to be done.

14

But I don't think that it is clear as

QUESTION:

Because ordinarily, even if you get a

15

prompt disposition in the trial court, you can wait, you

16

know, a good year before you get a disposition on appeal.

17

MR. NATHAN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, that's true, Your Honor.

Has -- has anyone suggested that your

19

-- I don't know the -- the merits of this separation of

20

powers problem that you raise, but has anyone suggested

21

that the answer to that may simply be not to try to

22

directly control the courts to come down with a decision

23

after X days or weeks or whatnot, but simply have a kind

24

of circuit breaker provision that if they don't, the

25

license will be deemed to be granted?

It could be provision.

It could be

If -- if the -- if the State doesn't want to

9

MR. NATHAN:

But that would avoid

But it would also create the

10

secondary risk by having an unqualified applicant, since

11

that is what we're talking about in the standards that

we're -­

Well, but we -- we don't know.

14

That's -- that's the whole point.

15

the applicant is qualified.

16

And the -- the way, in effect, I -- to -- it seems to me

17

to ensure your interest is simply to -- to have an

18

encouragement to a prompt disposition.

19

machinery of the State cannot somehow pull itself together

20

to give the prompt disposition, then I don't know what

21

you've got to complain about.

22

MR. NATHAN:

We don't know whether

That's why you're in court.

these types of cases and determine if there are First

obligations to other litigants and -- and not move as fast

as the -- as the First Amendment would call for.

And unless there is an inducement to

MR. NATHAN:

But that's why in -- in Colorado

the rule 106 gives the court the ability to in its

In -- in which case then, if there

12

were this kind of circuit breaker provision, the -- the

courts would -- would have every procedural basis for

honoring it.

15

MR. NATHAN:

But, of course, if the city doesn't

16

bear the burden of going to court and it's the business

17

that goes to court, it would then have every incentive to

MR. NATHAN:

Just that when the plaintiff goes

2

to court, the business goes to court, it would have every

3

incentive to -- to try to go as slowly as possible,

4

whereas the incentive should be, if it wants a quick

5

decision, for it to move to expedite, to -- to brief

6

quickly and to argue quickly and ask the court for an

7

expedited decision, and if one is not availing, to go up

8

and ask the appellate court, under our rule 21 of the

9

Colorado Appellate Rules, to order the court to rule

quickly.
QUESTION:

Mr. Nathan, I gather that a -- I

12

gathered from your brief that your -- your principal

point, or at least a principal point in this case, is your

contention that this case is different from censorship

15

cases where the judgment is left to a -- a board with -­

with no standards as to whether a particular movie can be

claim here is that the matters that are determined by the

rather quite discernible, physical, and practical points.

What -- what specifically was the basis for
turning down the -- the license here?
MR. NATHAN:

Well, there's never been an

application for the license in this case.
QUESTION:

I see.

Well, what -- what would have

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been -- what would have been the issues if the application

2

had been filed?

3

MR. NATHAN:

In point of fact, except for the -­

4

its location -- it's in an improper zone and it's within

5

500 feet of a church and day care center -- Z.J. probably

6

would have been granted the license, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

But they say they're not an adult

8

business, and that's the preliminary characterization.

9

mean, they -- they don't have a license.

I

They didn't

10

apply for one because they said, we don't need a license.

11

We're not that kind of business.

12

MR. NATHAN:

But, Your Honor, that issue was

13

litigated fully in the district court and the district

14

court held that not only were they an adult business, but

15

that their arguments to the contrary were essentially

16

frivolous.

17

where we had to provide photographs, videotapes, layouts,

18

an accountant's determination of the amount of adult

19

materials, but the district court ruled on that issue and

20

found that they were unquestionably an adult business and

21

even cautioned counsel about rule 11 in their claim that

22

they weren't.

Now, it took some doing, in terms of discovery

23

QUESTION:

This is the Federal district court.

24

MR. NATHAN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Is -- is there no court, municipal

level court, in Colorado as there was in Baltimore?

2

mean, the -- the reaction of Maryland to the Freedman case

3

was to set up a proceeding in the Baltimore City court,

4

and it had explicit time lines.

5

an expedited appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals.

6

I

And then it provided for

So why -- I -- I thought that the FW/PBS case

7

said, we're -- we're not going to follow -- the -- the

8

government has to go into court because it isn't like

9

censorship.

But the other two apply.

So why don't you

10

just -- why isn't that the solution, the one that was

11

adopted in Freedman for -- for the proceedings in court?

12

MR. NATHAN:

Well, there's a serious question in

13

the issues before the Colorado Supreme Court now as to

14

whether a municipal court can handle a 106 review or

15

whether it has to be a district court from the State.

16

again, if you eliminate the -- what has been called the

17

third Freedman requirement of requiring the government to

18

go to court, then since it -- the -- the business is the

19

captain of that litigation, there's no reason to force the

20

government to mandate a decision within a set period of

21

time.

22

QUESTION:

But

Do you concede that the second

23

Freedman requirement demands that judicial review -- or

24

that -- that a judicial determination be concluded?

25

MR. NATHAN:

I do not, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

I thought that that's the whole issue

2

here, whether it's enough that you can promptly begin a

3

suit or whether, in fact, what -- what Freedman requires

4

is that a suit has to be raced through to termination in

5

these cases.

6

MR. NATHAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And our position

7

is -- is that the elimination of a third requirement makes

8

it more rational to have the second requirement be prompt

9

access and -- and effective access to the courts which -­

10

QUESTION:

But everyone who complains about

11

administrative action, adverse administrative action, has

12

a right to promptly open the door.

13

it to just to say access, then it essentially does

14

nothing.

15

MR. NATHAN:

So that, if you read

In this case, however, and in many

16

others, when you have clear objective standards, a quick

17

exit from the administrative process, a record of the

18

reasons for the denial, then access to the court is

19

meaningful because a court can readily determine if

20

there's a subterfuge to suppress speech through the

21

licensing mechanism.

22

QUESTION:

And I suppose that interpreting the

23

second requirement that way does prevent the

24

administrative agency from delaying matters by simply

25

delaying the issuance of its opinion.

MR. NATHAN:

QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.

May I ask this general question?

I

3

understand the standards are different, but just in terms

4

of the procedure, if I applied for a license to run a dry

5

cleaning establishment, would I have a different

6

procedural set of hurdles than this litigant does?

7

9

MR. NATHAN:

The -- the licensing requirements

QUESTION:

Right.

10

MR. NATHAN:

11

QUESTION:

And so I'm not sure what sort of -­

I know the standards are different to

12

qualify for it, but I'm just wondering if you're denied

14

if I had applied for -- to get into some entirely

15

different business?

16

MR. NATHAN:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

There's one curious feature in this

and maybe you could explain it to me.

20

in business.

21

MR. NATHAN:

Apparently this

They didn't apply for a sales tax

22

license until 8 months after they opened, and by that

23

time, because they had initiated litigation in the Federal

24

district court, we had already determined that they were

25

clearly an adult business and therefore they were denied

AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

16

MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
It is neither necessary nor appropriate to

17

require licensing schemes like Littleton's to provide

18

prompt judicial determination.

19

because, as this Court's cases demonstrate, the type of

20

judicial review required in licensing schemes must be

21

correlated to the First Amendment concerns that the

22

ordinances present.

23

far less than the risks of freewheeling censorship that

24

were at issue in Freedman and its progeny.

It's not necessary

2
3

In fact, it would be inappropriate to impose a
judicial deadline requirement for at least three reasons.

4
5

First, it would impede State and local efforts
to control secondary effects.

6

Second, it would offend notions of comity and

7

federalism by assuming that State judges will ignore their

8

constitutional obligations to be sensitive to the First

9

Amendment.

10

And finally, it would require local officials to

11

impose time limits on those over whom they have no

12

control.

13

Excuse me.
Thus, both constitutionally and

14

jurisprudentially, prompt access to meaningful review is

15

all that the Constitution requires.

16

The Freedman decision was motivated by two

17

concerns, neither of which is present here.

There's

18

neither the -- the problem of unbridled discretion, nor a

19

risk of self-censorship.

20

in two situations where you have either the possibility of

21

administrative delay or standardless discretion.

22

this Court has recognized in a number of cases, the

23

latter, standardless discretion, presents unique

24

challenges for judicial review.

25

context to require some type of judicial deadline because

Unbridled discretion occurs only

And as

It makes sense in that

essentially meaningful judicial review on an expedited

2

basis is impossible if there's no standard to give any

3

indication as to why the administrative decision was made.

4

QUESTION:

I -- I suppose that if we're

5

concerned, as I -- as I think the courts are concerned,

6

about protecting First Amendment rights, one thing we

7

could do is just say that if there's any apparent delay in

8

determination, the United States district courts under

9

1983 are free to -- are free to intervene at once.

10

MR. COLE:

And -- and, Your Honor, if -­

11

QUESTION:

I'm not sure if that helps you or if

12
13

it helps the respondent.
MR. COLE:

Well, 1983 is, of course, always

14

available as a vehicle for someone that's asserting that

15

their constitutional rights have been violated.

16

QUESTION:

Well, except that I -- I would think

17

the municipalities and the States would raise questions

18

about deferring to the State courts for determination of

19

State law issues and so forth.

20

MR. COLE:

Abstention doctrines, Younger

21

abstention, for instance, might come to play.

Here the

22

court -- or I'm sorry -- the city waived any abstention

23

argument in order to allow the 1983 case to proceed.

24

Potentially it could have, notwithstanding the abstention

25

argument, but of course, there would be the issue of

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

abstention which is one reason why prompt access to some

2

type of State remedy is so important in -- in the case if

3

1983 is not an effective vehicle.

4

QUESTION:

Of course, I guess we'd have to have

5

either a statute, such as the statute that requires

6

Federal district courts to expedite criminal cases.

7

not sure a Federal district court can both take the case

8

and also bump it up to the top of its docket.

9

that, leaving -- leaving behind people who have been

10

waiting several years to be heard?

11

will work without a Federal statute.

12

MR. COLE:

I'm

Can they do

I don't know that that

Well, and I guess at -- at core, it

13

doesn't matter whether you go to the Federal court under

14

1983 or to State court.

15

judge to the First Amendment concerns in both cases would

16

be the same and their willingness to move it to the front

17

of the docket would be the same.

18

Presumably the sensitivity of the

We look -- I mean, this Court has definitely in

19

the past shown that where State courts are not

20

sufficiently sensitive to First Amendment concerns, for

21

instance, in the Skokie case, the Court demonstrated that

22

it could fashion tools to handle what it felt was undue

23

delay in the court system.

24
25

QUESTION:

But we've also held that Federal

courts are -- should be very loathe to intervene in

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ongoing State proceedings.

2

is over and then you can go to Federal court.

3

MR. COLE:

Wait till the State proceeding

Absolutely, and in the Skokie case,

4

it came up through the State court system and directly

5

into this Court rather than via a district court model.

6

But -- but the point is as long as you have prompt access,

7

you're going to get access to a judicial official who is

8

going to be sensitive to First Amendment concerns and, if

9

necessary, has all the traditional tools of equity

10

available to provide immediate relief, TRO's, PI's.

11

QUESTION:

What -- what does prompt access mean

12

as opposed to relaxed access?

13

understand the content of prompt access if -- if access is

14

getting into court.

15

MR. COLE:

I -- I just don't

That's easy.

You file a complaint.

Well, you need -- under State

16

systems, most State systems have some form of requirement

17

that -- that the court knows that the administrative

18

process is over so it knows it doesn't have to defer to

19

the administrative process anymore.

20

exit, as well as a -- a vehicle that's either prescribed

21

by rule or by statute so everybody knows the appropriate

22

vehicle and there aren't any questions about the

23

jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter, as well as a

24

record that -- that they can use to make a -- a prompt

25

review when it gets before them, we would contend that

So by having a clear

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that meets what this Court was talking about with respect

2

to the second prong in FW/PBS.

3

QUESTION:

4

Does the local ordinance provide a

limit, time limit, for the administrative proceeding?

5

MR. COLE:

Absolute, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

What is -- what is that?

7

MR. COLE:

I believe, as it's currently drafted,

8

it is up to about 40 days, but it could be even quicker

9

than that.

I say up to.

There are certain periods of

10

time within which the applicant can act within the next 10

11

days, and so if they act within the first day, then that

12

would shorten the time frame even further.

13

QUESTION:

Do you think those administrative

14

requirements are -- are mandated under the Constitution

15

when First Amendment issues are -- are present?

MR. COLE:

yes, Your Honor.

I believe that -- that comes from

showing here that there would be a protracted judicial

QUESTION:

No, no, but I -- I asked you if -- if

6

you concede that there is a requirement of expedition at

the administrative process -- at -- at the administrative

8

level, it then seems to me that it also follows there has

9

to be one at the judicial level.

10

MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the question

11

before the Court today, though, is what does Littleton's

12

or a town like Littleton's licensing scheme need to

13

provide.

14

obligations on State court judges to act promptly with

15

respect to First Amendment concerns, but the question is,

16

does that need to appear in the text of Littleton's

17

ordinance?

18

There may be some independent constitutional

QUESTION:

Do you concede that there are such

obligations?

20

MR. COLE:

I concede that -- that courts have an

23

issues.

to know should we do the sorting beforehand or after, and

25

the Court says, not surprisingly, let's them talk and then

To me, that puts a real point

That assumes we need to do some

1

we'll punish the ones who utter things that are not

2

protected by the First Amendment.

3

Here there's no need to engage in that kind of

4

sorting.

Any adult business has the prospect for creating

the secondary effects that this Court has recognized in

Renton and Young and -- so it's not a matter of sorting

them.

MR. COLE:

Well, but if you're not subject to

review under this ordinance, and you'll do what -- what

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. GROSS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22

MR. GROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

23

The core policy in Freedman, recognized in this

24

Court's decision in FW/PBS, is that a decision to issue a

25

license to present -- protect the expression must be made

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

MR. GROSS:

Because certainly PBS

FW/PBS did relax the third Freedman

15

safeguard.

think in the Court's analysis of -- when the Court

17

undertook that direction, the Court indicated that the

administrative officials -- certainly administrative

officials are subject to much greater pressures to censor.

the city did deny a sales tax license on the basis that it

was an adult business.

They won't put any -- any indication what those terms

actually mean.

QUESTION:

They won't define what that means.

Well, this -- this goes maybe over

the same ground, but let's assume that in the -- in a

recognized that licensing restrictions that apply and -­

The Federal courts are open to that.

abstention that we talked about before.

QUESTION:

Certainly if there are

Mr. Gross, can I ask you sort of a -­

7

a basic question that I haven't really thought through?

8

Should there be a different time schedule for the person

9

who wants to operate just an ordinary bookstore that just

10

sells textbooks for schools and -- and trade books, on the

11

one hand, and an adult bookstore on the other hand?

12

one of them be entitled to more prompt review of his

13

license application than the other?

14

MR. GROSS:

Would

I -- I would -- yes, Your Honor.

I

15

think under FW/PBS, the Court indicated that there was an

16

additional burden placed upon adult bookstores and that

17

Freedman had to be complied with.

18

QUESTION:

So you think the Constitution

19

commands more prompt treatment of an application by an

20

adult bookstore than by an ordinary bookstore.

MR. GROSS:

I -- I think it -- there's -- you

The city refuses to provide any definitive determination

of what that means.

what the court determined in that particular case.

We -- we were trying to

So we had to go to court, and that's

Now, what I don't understand is you

-- you are concerned about the -- the efficacy of judicial

review.

court rather than the State court.

You picked your forum.

10

MR. GROSS:

11

QUESTION:

You picked the Federal

Yes.
You got a review of that ordinance,

12

every piece of it, for constitutionality.

13

understand what complaint you have now about judicial

14

review, having had judicial review in the Federal court

15

and having had the Federal court uphold most of this

16

ordinance.

17

-- how -- how are you a proper complainant about what

18

access you might have had in the State courts if you chose

19

to go there?

20

I don't

So you've -- you've had judicial review.

MR. GROSS:

How

Well, we -- we brought the facial

challenge in the -- in the Federal court.

There is -- and

there is continuing injury in this case.

violations would go away.

there's potentially $2 million in fines.

QUESTION:

Each carries a $1,000 fine.

So

But you -- the -- the

unconstitutional area left is this prompt judicial review,

but you've already had judicial review.

6

don't understand what is your current complaint.

7

MR. GROSS:

That's why I

The current complaint is it's -- we

QUESTION:

I have to confess to another problem.

22

As I understand part of your argument, you're contending

23

you're not an adult bookstore, an adult establishment,

24

aren't you?

25

MR. GROSS:

That's correct.

So you're contending you don't have

challenge -- standing to challenge the ordinance.

3

MR. GROSS:

Well, the city says we do.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. GROSS:

But we do have -- there is an injury

6

in fact in this case because the city has initiated 2,620

7

license violations, up to $2 million in fines in a

8

municipal court.

9

mean, this isn't the case like or Pap's or like Waukesha.

10

That -- that's a real injury.

QUESTION:

And, I

Maybe that's because you decided to

11

go into business without getting a license, which might

12

have been a fairly reckless thing to do, I would think.

13

MR. GROSS:

Well, we went to Federal court and

14

the -- the city, you know, did pursue their claims in

15

State court.

16

Certainly, I mean, the -- the business can't be

17

faulted for -- too much for being a business.

18

the Waukesha case and in the Pap's case, those businesses

19

were out of business.

QUESTION:

I mean, in

I mean -­

Is -- is what you're saying that

there is a reliance interest on the part of these

businesses?

efficient licensing procedure with judicial review so they

can factor into their costs of -- of doing business

whether or not they can afford, say, 3 months of expedited

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

litigation and that this is a -- a First Amendment

interest.

MR. GROSS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The -­

4

with regard to a -- an ongoing business, as opposed to an

5

individual work of art, getting the license is key -- is

6

key to the -- to the ability to maintain a business.

7

so an investor, an entrepreneur, trying to start a

8

business, hire employees, get a location, supply

9

inventory, needs an assurance that there will be a

10

And

decision within a specific period of time by a court.

11

This is not your run-of-the-mill administrative

12

decision.

13

based upon content of the speech, based upon this

14

ordinance that is focused upon one class of businesses

15

that -­

16

This -- this involves the First Amendment issue

QUESTION:

If -- if the States know that the -­

17

that the penalty they suffer for not doing that is having

18

to submit themselves to Federal court litigation where the

19

Federal courts really sweep abstention aside and so forth

20

because of the urgency, I guess that's maybe the decision

21

that States should make.

22

MR. GROSS:

Well, I think the States -- they

23

need to -- it's our position they need to expedite the

24

judicial review, and -- and the provisional license

25

doesn't really solve the problem.

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I would note that the municipal court -- the

municipalities do have the ability to -- to enact laws, to

have review in the municipal court.

just went through a process where there's a requirement

that review occur within 75 days of the administrative

decision.

And that

You are content with the review in

In fact, last week I

MR. GROSS:

No.

Well, it depends on how it

comes out.

13

QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.

14

MR. GROSS:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. GROSS:

But -- but certainly --

And we're -- we may well prevail in

17

that case, but certainly we have a right to an appeal.

18

this case, we prevailed on the appeal in the court of -­

19

State court of appeals and the Tenth Circuit on this

20

issue.

21

QUESTION:

In

If the -- if the municipal court was

22

good enough in Freedman, where you had a real censorship

23

problem, why shouldn't it be adequate, entirely adequate,

24

for adult bookstores?

MR. GROSS:

It may well be, Your Honor.

I think

the -- you know, in that -- there may -- it may be -- it

MR. GROSS:

We're not talking about a licensor

that talks a specific book.

Is a -- when you talk about a

the City of Littleton or a municipal court created by the

MR. GROSS:

This would be the City of Littleton

20

referring to before.

order, the business has changed its operation quite a bit.

I would note that, however, the -- the city says

that there's no discretion in this case, that it's purely

a ministerial decision.

to counter their argument, but certainly it really doesn't

really peculiar is that if, you know, some homeowner has

procedures and get -- you know, get -- get approval from

know, I -- I have to wait 2 years before I can put in my

10

That seems to be very strange.

MR. GROSS:

You

And if -- if

Well, I would -- those are laws of

general application, and certainly an adult bookstore, if

it went through the normal process, would have to go

5

-- 2:00 a.m.?

6

MR. GROSS:

Arguably they -- they raise First

7

Amendment concerns in terms of time, place, and manner

8

arguments, and I think there may -- there's a case out of

9

the Ninth Circuit.

It may be before this Court on a cert

10

petition with regard to an hours operation.

11

arguably raise that there are additional burdens.

12

like in FW/PBS, there was an additional burden placed upon

13

these stores on -- by virtue of the content of the

14

material that is sold and distributed from the bookstore.

15

But they

18

issued and the State has the power to enforce laws of

19

health, safety, and welfare against the bookstore.

20

The court -- in fact, there was an injunction

QUESTION:

How about the sales tax?

You're

21

still operating without a sales tax license, but you're

22

selling things.

23

MR. GROSS:

We -- we have worked out an

24

agreement with the city where they do pay the sales tax.

25

They did not grant the license, but we have managed to

tax and has been paying the sales tax.

3

The store has been collecting sales

But the city -- and at the current time, the

4

city has not moved to follow up on their -- their nuisance

5

case in State court to enjoin for not having a sales tax

license.

7

whether the definition of a store is adult or not adult.

8

But the city retains the power to -- to enforce the law

9

through nuisance cases, just like any other case, in time

Of course, that -- that is based upon the -­

10

-- with regard to health, safety, and welfare of

11

businesses.

12

QUESTION:

Not enforce the licensing law.

13

Enforce the secondary -- go after the secondary effects

14

nuisance laws.

15

MR. GROSS:

They could enforce those too.

The

16

license -- the zoning law would be a secondary effects

17

law, and there -- and at this point there is no injunction

18

in State court.

upon the State court order -- excuse me -- the Federal

court order.

QUESTION:

It sounds like you've got a lot of

access.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. GROSS:

We -- it's -- you can file a

5

lawsuit.

I mean, there's -- certainly you can -- you have

6

a right to file a lawsuit everywhere you can, and we've -­

7

we've -- there has been lawsuits filed by both the city.

8

And the city had access on the -- on the injunction case.

9

There was a stay denied, in fact, after -- after the

10

injunction was issued.

I mean, this business has been

11

fighting to stay open.

It's been fighting and has stayed

12

-- in fact, stayed open unlike the case in Waukesha and

13

Pap's, you know.

14

I mean, it's clear municipalities have taken

15

every opportunity to try to regulate these businesses, try

16

to put in every obstruction possible with regard to

17

getting these businesses to -- to be closed down.

18

Now, the issue -- the answer to the question

19

before this Court is that the essential constitutional

20

requirement -- and that was identified in -- in the FW/PBS

21

case as an essential requirement -- is that prompt

22

judicial determine does actually mean prompt judicial -­

23

does mean prompt judicial determination without an

24

actual -­

25

QUESTION:

It didn't say it in -- it said prompt

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

judicial review, whatever that meant.

2

MR. GROSS:

That's correct, based upon Freedman.

3

And if -- if we take it back to Freedman, you read

4

Freedman and Freedman does -- did provide a right of

5

access, a right of appeal and talked about judicial review

6

interchangeably with prompt judicial determination,

7

disposition, and so forth.

8

Now, without an actual judicial disposition, the

9

administrative officials will have the power to shut down

10

an entire business, not simply a single work of art, but

11

it will be an entire business.

12

there's an error with regard to -- to what is -- what the

13

licensing official says, that's why prompt judicial review

14

is so important in this case.

15

of the speech rights will -- will cause irreparable

16

injury, and that's the core policy behind the Freedman

17

case.

18

If there's an error -- if

The erroneous deprivation

Now, in the absence of prompt judicial review,

19

the -- the status quo will be silenced.

In this case, the

20

bookstore went to court and get -- got the access, but -­

21

and the trial court will be understandably reluctant to

22

alter the status quo of silence.

23

the default position of any trial court.

24

explicit statement from this court with regard to the

25

second prong of Freedman, it's not -- I think it's

And that is essentially

difficult to assume that a State court with its heavy

2

docket will actually provide a prompt decision.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any experience in that

4

regard?

5

Have the State courts been dragging their heels?

6

This ordinance has been on the books for a time.

MR. GROSS:

Well, yes, this law was enacted in

7

1993.

It's been amended many times.

In this case, the

8

State nuisance action was filed in January of 2000, and

9

the district court issued its order in September of 2001,

10

and that order was reversed in February of 2003.

11

the normal course of -- of events in the State court

12

litigation.

The city did not move for a preliminary

13

injunction.

They did move for contempt.

14

months to get the contempt heard, and once the contempt

15

was heard, it came out in favor of the bookstore.

16

that's -- that's the experience in this case.
