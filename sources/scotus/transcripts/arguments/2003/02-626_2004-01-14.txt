ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. BISHOP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress in the Clean Water Act provided that a

12

section 402 permit is required for an addition of

13

pollutants from a point source to navigable waters.

14

Now, the South Florida Water Management District

15

concedes that the S-9 pump, through which it conveys

16

navigable waters from a canal to a water conservation

17

area, is a confined, discrete, discernible conveyance, and

18

we agree that the water in the C-11 canal contains

19

pollution which enters that water from a wide variety of

20

point and non-point sources.

21

What we do say is that our pumps do not add

22

pollutants to navigable waters.

23

pollutants to navigable waters when navigable waters are

24

simply moved around, which occurs all the time every day

25

all around the country as public water management agencies

There is no addition of

1

allocate and transfer the navigable waters to serve

2

beneficial public purposes.

3

QUESTION:

The obvious question on your thing is

4

you have one of these rivers that's so filthy that you can

5

set fire to it, and next to it is the most pristine,

6

beautiful trout lake ever.

7

little pipe and the pipe takes these filthy, absolutely

8

disgusting water and pours it into this beautiful,

9

pristine trout pond.

10
11

All right?

Now, you're saying that that doesn't fall within
the statute, and --

12
13

And so what we build is a

MR. BISHOP:

No.

It does fall within the

statute.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BISHOP:

I mean it doesn't require a permit.
It -- it would not require a

16

section 402 permit.

17

protection from that occurring.

18

QUESTION:

There are all sorts of layers of

Well, as far as this statute is

19

concerned, EPA, it wouldn't.

20

obvious thing is that --

21
22

MR. BISHOP:

No.

And -- and, of course, the

That -- that's not true

either, Justice Breyer.

23

QUESTION:

24

Through the permit.

25

That would never --

I mean, EPA through the permit.

MR. BISHOP:

Through the 402, but this -- this

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is a complex statute with many, many layers of protections

2

for the Nation's waters.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BISHOP:

And it would protect -To begin with, there is always a

5

layer of State protection.

6

water quality standards be established for portions of the

7

navigable waters.

8

implemented through total maximum daily load requirements

9

that the States are -- are required under the statute to

The statute requires that

Those water quality standards are

10

-- to design.

11

water quality standards through non-point source pollution

12

programs that include land use restrictions, that include

13

advice to and requirements on landowners as to best

14

management practices.

15

The States implement the TMDL's and the

QUESTION:

I -- I suppose it's beyond the

16

purview of this case.

17

transfer of waters in this case would violate those other

18

regulations?

19

MR. BISHOP:

Do we know whether or not the

No, it does not.

The -- the --

20

there are exceedances.

21

while not permitted under 402, is permitted by the State

22

under The Everglades Forever Act.

23

quality standards for the canal and for the water

24

conservation area.

25

of those.

Understand that the S-9 pump,

But there are water

The -- there is compliance with both

There are exceedances, phosphorus exceedances,

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

from time to time, but those are built into the permit.

2

The -- the cleaning up of the Everglades, which

3

is something that everyone is committed to and the

4

district is deeply committed to, is not an overnight

5

process.

6

Everglades Restoration statute and also under The

7

Everglades Forever Act to address these exceedances in the

8

long term, but --

9

And so there are plans through the Comprehensive

QUESTION:

Mr. Bishop, the Eleventh Circuit said

10

that moving water within a single, distinct body of water

11

could never result in the addition of pollutants to that

12

body of water.

13

statement?

14

Now, I assume you agree with that

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I agree with that, but we and

15

the United States go further here in arguing that the

16

statute -- what the statute prohibits is the addition of

17

pollutants to navigable waters.

18

defined in the statute as the waters of the United States.

19

It's our position and the position of the United States,

20

if I read their brief correctly, that an addition of

21

pollutants from a point source occurs when the pollutant

22

is introduced to the navigable waters for the first time.

23

And that is what the --

24
25

QUESTION:

Navigable waters are

So in -- in Justice Breyer's example,

if the pristine trout pond is waters of the United States,

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then there would not be an addition of the pollutant to

2

waters of the United States when the filthy river was

3

pumped into the pond.

4

MR. BISHOP:

No.

That would violate State water

5

quality standards which are --

6

QUESTION:

No.

I -- maybe it would violate the

7

standards, but I'm -- I'm just talking about the provision

8

required here.

9
10
11

MR. BISHOP:

It would not require a section 402

permit, Justice Souter.
QUESTION:

And -- and it would not do so because

12

it would not be the addition of a pollutant to waters of

13

the United States.

14

MR. BISHOP:

15

QUESTION:

17
18

filthy river.

Assuming the river is navigable, the

Right?

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

20

MR. BISHOP:

22

Assuming that it's a navigable

water under the Clean Water Act --

19

21

That is right.

Right.
-- and that -- which is a broader

concept than waters that one can run -QUESTION:

Well, what I'm driving at here is --

23

is the following.

24

it's a very difficult question.

25

it, it seems to me I live -- leave the EPA without any

You have ambiguous language.

I think

If I accept your side of

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

power to deal with what I just called the filthy river

2

problem, or at least not the -- I'm not trying to be

3

tricky in my words.

4

authority and so forth.

5

problem if I take your side of it.

6

I -- I understand they have other
But there is a filthy river

And if I take their -- if I take your side of

7

it, that is some kind of a problem.

8

in 1 second why it's no problem whatsoever.

9

hear that.

10

You can explain to me
I'd like to

I want to say the opposite thing.

Your problem that you raise, if I take their

11

side, is suddenly everybody in the California water

12

project, which is huge, central valley irrigation, has to

13

run off and get permits, and that too is a big problem.

14

So it sounds to me that that second problem

15

could be dealt with by EPA through rules that would, in

16

effect, not make them come in because they'd automatically

17

get permits in certain circumstances.

18

side of it, the opposite filthy river problem, there's

19

nothing to be done.

20

MR. BISHOP:

21

QUESTION:

But if I take your

Your premise --

So that's what I say moves me at the

22

second for hypothetical purposes towards their side, but

23

I'm asking you to move me back.

24

MR. BISHOP:

25

Breyer.

Your premise is incorrect, Justice

Of course, moving filthy water to a pristine

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

water is a problem.

2

addressed and addressed comprehensively and rigorously at

3

the State level, as Congress contemplated in the statute

4

through the water quality standards and TMDL's.

5
6
7

I've already explained that it's

But beyond that, it is simply wrong to say that
the Federal Government lacks power in these cases.
First of all, it has broad power under section

8

10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to protect navigability,

9

and that -- that provision also includes power for the

10

Corps to engage in a broad public interest review whenever

11

the course of a waterway is changed.

12

Second, there are other provisions that deal

13

with emergency type situations.

14

welfare, for example, is implicated, then section 504 of

15

the statute gives EPA broad powers to go into court and

16

get a restraining order not just for the discharge of

17

pollutants, but much more broadly than that.

18

QUESTION:

If public health or

Mr. Bishop, can we see -- take this

19

concrete case?

20

being dumped into a relatively unpolluted body of water.

21

What is the State of Florida or anybody doing to reduce

22

the level of phosphorus that comes from this pump and gets

23

dumped into the pure water?

24
25

I mean, this is a case about phosphorus

MR. BISHOP:

Well, this has -- this has been the

focus of not only our attention but of the Corps and EPA's

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

attention for a long time through the -- the Comprehensive

2

Everglades Restoration Project.

3

a lot of things that are happening to -- to reduce the

4

phosphorus level, some of which are sort of purely State

5

water quality standard implementation projects, such as

6

prohibiting the sale of certain types of fertilizers,

7

restricting the use of fertilizers that contain

8

phosphorus.

9

essentially two components.

10

If I can -- and there are

But the long-term CERP plans here have

The first one is that much of the water in the

11

C-11 basin, in the canal, actually comes from the

12

conservation area through seepage.

13

amount of --

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

There's an enormous

May I ask you a question right

15

-- I know some seeps through, but what is the principal

16

source of the water in the C-11 basin?

17
18

MR. BISHOP:
is seepage.

19

I mean, obviously there are --

QUESTION:

20

source?

21

the Everglades?

22

Well, my understanding is that it

You think that's the principal

It seeps in.

MR. BISHOP:

You're just pumping it back into

That is my -- that is my

23

understanding.

24

and the seepage involved --

25

There is an enormous amount of seepage,

QUESTION:

But where does the water that the

1

people in the western part of Broward County use to water

2

their lawns and bathe and so -- where does that water come

3

from?

4
5

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

There's an aquifer to the east of the

-- of the levees?

8
9

MR. BISHOP:

There is an aquifer that -- an

unconfined aquifer that is really indistinguishable from

10

the surface water that underlies the levee.

11

it is not divided by the levee.

12

the surface water, on both sides --

13
14

QUESTION:

To the east of the levees and to

the -- it's -QUESTION:

Which is a separate source of water

than the source that feeds the large -- the WCA-3 --

19
20

It underlies the water,

Are you telling me there's an aquifer

MR. BISHOP:

17
18

But it's --

to the east of the levee?

15
16

I mean,

obviously, in -- in --

6
7

From -- from the aquifer.

MR. BISHOP:

No, no.

This is an aquifer that

underlies both sides of the levee, the WCA and the basin.

21

But if I can get back to -- I mean, your -- your

22

question.

23

What I am told is that seepage alone will be enough to

24

flood out towns like --

25

Obviously, the seepage is an enormous source.

QUESTION:

But the seepage can't --

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

3

But the seepage can't contain any of

the pollution --

4

MR. BISHOP:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

There is other --

No.

-- because the water on the west side

of the levee is -- is clean.
MR. BISHOP:

Well, it's not clean.

I mean, it

8

does contain pollutants under the definition of the Clean

9

Water Act because that's a broad definition.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, it's certainly cleaner than the

water on the east side or you wouldn't have a lawsuit.
MR. BISHOP:

There is a substantial amount of

13

water in the C-11 canal that comes from a -- a wide array

14

of sources within the basin.

15

QUESTION:

But the water -- the seepage clearly

16

is not what causes the problem.

17

MR. BISHOP:

And that is -- just to go back to

18

Justice Ginsburg's question, one way that we are

19

addressing the phosphorus here is with the Corps.

20

Corps has built a new set of pumps right next to the S-9

21

that is intended to intercept that cleaner seepage water,

22

and it will pump that seepage water right back into the

23

WCA before it is mixed with the more polluted waters from

24

the C-11 basin.

25

to get the seepage water back into the water conservation

The

So that is one part of the effort.

It is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

area before it mixes with more polluted water.

2

QUESTION:

Which -- which means --

3

MR. BISHOP:

4

QUESTION:

Those pumps are --

Which means that the water to the

5

east will be even more polluted and when you pump that

6

back in, you'll be pumping more polluted water back in.

7

MR. BISHOP:

And the solution to that problem is

8

that with the Corps and the task force and the EPA, a

9

number of huge storage basins are being built.

These

10

require, obviously, buying a lot of land, putting together

11

the land necessary for these STA's.

12

purpose of the plans under CERP is to stop as much water

13

as possible getting from the C-11 to the water

14

conservation area.

15

possible in these basins will allow the phosphorus and

16

other pollutants to settle out, and so water that is --

17

and will also reduce the total amount of water that needs

18

to be sent back into the conservation area.

19

But the -- the

And so storing as much water as

The combination of these new pumps getting the

20

-- the cleaner water back into the -- into the

21

conservation area and the storage basins, which will

22

reduce the amount of flow and allow the pollutants to --

23

to seep down, is -- is the essential way in which under

24

CERP the problem of the phosphorus will be addressed.

25

No one disputes -- and the district least of all

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

disputes -- that cleaning up the Everglades and reducing

2

the amount of phosphorus that gets into the water

3

conservation area which, in turn, feeds the Everglades is

4

a very important consideration.

5

But you also have to understand that our

6

purposes -- we are not -- we are not just dumping this

7

water in -- in the water conservation area.

8

could be sent to the ocean.

portion of the canal, the water is sent to the ocean.

11

that are served by the water conservation area,

maintaining water in there.

This is all very important, but on

that it's a single body of water --

MR. BISHOP:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

We take --

-- and therefore no permit is

required?
MR. BISHOP:

We take the position, first of all,

20

that all of the navigable waters of the United States are

21

unitary for purposes of determining whether they are --

22
23

QUESTION:

That's an extreme position, and you

probably have a fall-back position.

24

MR. BISHOP:

25

(Laughter.)

And the alternative --

QUESTION:

You -- you go --

2

MR. BISHOP:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BISHOP:

We do argue --

What -- what's the fall-back?
The fall-back is precisely the one

5

that you have described, Justice O'Connor, which is that

6

these were -- these were unitary waters.

7

solely by manmade structures that are changeable and are

8

changing.

9

QUESTION:

They are divided

Well, they have been altered by

10

manmade structures so that they perhaps are no longer a

11

single body.

12

in effect?

Is that what the Eleventh Circuit concluded

13

MR. BISHOP:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes, I think the --

That the manmade structures have

separated them and they're no longer unitary.

16

MR. BISHOP:

It -- it did, but in doing that, it

ignored a number of important considerations.

QUESTION:

While you're looking for that, I -- I

find it hard to understand how you can interpret -- I can

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understand how you can interpret the phrase, navigable

2

waters, to mean all navigable waters.

3

how you can interpret the phrase, navigable waters, to

4

mean only those navigable waters that are within a single

5

aquifer or within a single drainage district.

6

can you possibly derive that interpretation from the text?

7

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

11

I can't understand

How -- how

No, I agree, Justice Scalia.

Which is -- which is why you took the

extreme position, that is really textually not very
extreme at all.
MR. BISHOP:

No.

I agree with that, Justice

12

Scalia, obviously.

13

were a level of discomfort with that argument, which I

14

think is -- you know, it's fully justified by the statute.

15

And I'd like to come back to that, Justice O'Connor, and

16

explain the other textual basis for -- for that argument.

Nevertheless --

But I -- but I do think that if there

MR. BISHOP:

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Bishop, as I --- the concept of an addition --

-- as I understand, that was the

21

Government's brief and it was spelled out very clearly.

22

didn't understand your brief to be taking the position

23

that all we have to worry about is the term, navigable

24

water, then that's the end of it.

25

MR. BISHOP:

I

Well, we think that there is more

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to it than just the term, navigable water.

2

-- that we do -- we have argued throughout this case,

3

including in the lower courts, that the navigable waters

4

are a unitary concept for purposes of section 402.

5

QUESTION:

We think that

Mr. Bishop, isn't the problem with

6

the unitary concept idea that given the purposes of the

7

Clean Water Act, it makes great sense if there is a way of

8

distinguishing between bodies of water to distinguish them

9

in terms of their -- their pollution?

And the -- in -- in

10

effect, the -- the function of the kind of unitary

11

definition is a function that -- that works against the

12

protection of clean water as against to dirty water that

13

can be added to it.

14

the purposes of the act be taken into consideration in

15

defining what is a body or a unified body of water?

16

And -- and shouldn't the -- shouldn't

MR. BISHOP:

The act does distinguish.

Congress

17

distinguished, when it wanted to, between the waters of

18

the United States and specific portions of the navigable

19

water.

20

in the addendum.

21

And there's an example of that at the bottom of 7a

QUESTION:

Are -- are you talking about a -- a

22

distinction based on the -- the quality of the water as

23

polluted or clean or relatively polluted/relatively clean?

24
25

MR. BISHOP:

The statute specifies that water

quality standards which identify what the goal is for the

illegitimate as a matter of interpretation?

3

And my question is, why would it be

MR. BISHOP:

Well, that's my run-through.

The

4

plain language of the statute is navigable waters defined

5

as the waters of the United States.

6

the use of the broad term discharge in section 401(a)

7

where Congress meant to reach much more and which isn't

8

limited by this language of an addition to the navigable

9

waters.

10

That is backed up by

It is backed up by 304(f)(2)(F) where Congress

11

described as non-point source pollution pollution

12

resulting from the changes in the flow and circulation of

13

navigable waters or ground waters caused by flow diversion

14

devices like the pump.

15

And it's backed up by the fact that neither

16

Congress nor EPA has ever at any time since 1972 suggested

17

that these sorts of movements of water should be governed

18

by section 402.

19

If I may reserve the balance of my time.

20

QUESTION:

Then what did -- what did the tribe

21

mean when it said that there are, I think -- major

22

components of the Everglades construction project are

already under NPDES programs?

25

MR. BISHOP:

Those are the STA's.

So when

you move water from a treatment area to a navigable water,

that requires 402 permitting.

move water from one location to another.

position is correct on the basis of both the text of the

statute, the overarching purposes of the statute and its

6

structure, and also EPA's actual practices.

7

We believe that

I'd like to turn first to the text of the

statute.

Section 402 states that a NPDES permit is

10

navigable waters from a point source, and section 5027

11

goes on to state that a -- the waters -- the navigable

12

waters are the waters of the United States.

13

Under that definition and those statutory

14

provisions, when an industrial out-fall introduces

15

pollutants for the first time into the waters of the

16

United States, an NPDES permit is required.

17

a water control facility like the S-9 pump simply moves

18

water from one place to another, together with any

19

pollutants that might be contained therein, that

20

regulatory regime is not called into play.

actually implicates a number of different programs.

3

of all, in the case of the polluted river, that river is

might be going into that polluted river.

12

If there's an attempt to connect that river to

I'd like to make the point also that our

position is not an extreme one in saying that the -- the

text requires that we only look at the pollution when it

first enters the water.

that recognizes that cleaning up polluted water requires a

number of different control strategies.

QUESTION:

Rather, it's a -- it's a approach

The NPDES

Well, what do we make of information

such as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania,

type of program on its own under its State law to deal

with those types of programs.

Pennsylvania is issuing the 402 permits in lieu of the

So

My point is -It's done the same thing in Florida.

Yes, that is the view.

The brief

10

of the United States here is it reflects a consensus of a

Interior, the Corps of Engineers, and the Department of

Army.

14

And I'd like to mention there's been some

suggestion that this Court should draw inferences from the

16

names that are on the cover of the brief, and those

17

inferences should not be drawn.

have no relationship to whether or not -- the absence of

the names of an agency does not indicate the brief does --

does not represent the views of a particular agency.

can be seen in a number of briefs, including the Swank

please the Court:
The Miccosukee Tribe and Friends of the

3

Everglades contend that a pollutant is added to navigable

4

waters whenever it's put into navigable waters where it

5

would not otherwise be, whenever it's put somewhere where

6

it's not already there or would not naturally flow.

7

The receiving navigable water body is the point

8

of focus under the Clean Water Act because the act

9

specifically provides for designating different water

10

bodies with specific designated uses and with associated

11

water quality standards that will protect those uses.

12

the associated permitting system of the act 402 rests on

13

the assumption that the proprietary of the -­

14

proprietariness of the proposed addition of a pollutant

15

will be measured against the receiving navigable water

16

body's designated use and against the receiving navigable

17

water body's water quality standards.

QUESTION:

What -- what says that?

And

I mean, the

reason navigable waters need not have and would be

MR. LEHTINEN:

Yes, Justice Scalia, but if that

were the meaning of that text and the lack of an

16

MR. LEHTINEN:

Yes, the United States, Justice

17

Breyer, on many occasions -- starting in 1975 EPA general

18

counsel issued the opinion that surface water runoff and

19

return flows from irrigation, even when in navigable

20

waters, that is to say an agricultural canal, when then

21

discharged to other navigable waters, would require a

22

permit.

Congress, if it had repudiated it, would have said that

24

was not an addition.

Congress did not repudiate that because what --

They go

along and the water is pure and it sort of picks up some

3

the First Circuit said, the argument about whether Loon

All right.

6

MR. LEHTINEN:

So what's your response to that?
Well, Your Honor, first with

7

respect to the same body of water, if you were referring

8

to the Everglades, this is a -- C-11 is a canal that has

gas stations, urban shopping malls, industrial parks

larger water projects, Your Honor, first of all, if

So these large movements through canals and

2

water projects -- the State controls the designation of

3

those uses.

4

And even if they were found to be a movement

of its brief, none of their movements of water, through

in a water quality standard violation.

As well, most of these big movements of water

MR. LEHTINEN:

We -- we believe, as -- as

Congress did, that the Clean Water Act -- that the

programs in place were not always implemented and that the

17

Clean Water Act was necessary as a backstop to stop the

18

backsliding.

19

required the State to do no more than the State in press

20

releases was saying that it was doing and intended to do,

21

but the litigation, reinforced by Congress that

22

specifically said we don't intend to interfere with any of

23

that litigation, indicates why Federal enforcement is a --

24

is a useful and necessary tool to ensure that States under

25

different pressures don't backslide.

The Federal Government's litigation in 1988

Our brief appendix indicates that 2 years ago

2

they indicated they would meet water quality standards in

3

the S-9 by 2005, and then with the pendency of this

4

litigation, they have eliminated any commitment to reach

5

it by 2005, hoping that this litigation will first relieve

6

them of the oversight of the NPDES on S-9 and then they

7

will use this litigation to eliminate the NPDES's that

8

were required from 1993 forward on the other projects.

9

The only thing that keeps those -- those other discharge

10

structures under the restoration project from not being

extended or otherwise modified by the State are the EPA-

With respect to the question of singular waters,

the singular waters approach of the United States

17

eliminates the different designated uses and the ability

to actually determine the effects of a permit.

Minnesota amici brief is very useful in this sense because

20

it points out that St. Paul now, like the Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania and others, does get an NPDES to remove water

22

from the Mississippi to its lake and water reservoir.

23

However, if the Solicitor General's position were correct,

St. Paul would no longer need that NPDES permit, and St.

the Mississippi, which have been found to meet the NPDES

3

requirements, not changing the designated use or violating

4

the Mississippi's water quality standard -- it -- its

5

discharges should be deemed to be somehow removable

6

artificially downstream in the Mississippi so that

anyplace anyone at any time might construct the pipe and

8

move them into a more pristine water body, you, St. Cloud

9

now have to anticipate that and will be put under that --

that mandate.
So the inability of a permit writer to construct

is now to the receiving navigable water, but instead I

have to evaluate where anyone with a pipe might move it,

hundreds and hundreds of miles, without an NPDES permit,
