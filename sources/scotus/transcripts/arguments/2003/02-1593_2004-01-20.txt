CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

the United States.

Mr. McCrum.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TIMOTHY McCRUM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. McCRUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case began in 1993 when the Bureau of Land

12

Management issued notices of trespass for the extraction

13

of common sand and gravel from private land in the Nevada

14

desert about 60 miles from Las Vegas.

15

The central issue in this case is whether, under

16

the 1919 Pittman Act, the reservation of valuable minerals

17

included common sand and gravel that were -- that were

18

widespread and made up the bulk of the land.

19

Now, the purpose of the Pittman Act was to

20

develop the State of Nevada by granting private land to

21

citizens who made personal sacrifices to discover and

22

develop underground sources of water that was not -- that

23

were not previously known.

24
25

QUESTION:

It applied only in Nevada, did it

not?

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. McCRUM:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

Now, Mabel and Newton Butler in this case

3

explored and found a -- a source of underground water and

4

obtained a land patent from the United States Government

5

in 1940.

6

As we've explained in the briefs, the plain

7

meaning of the words valuable minerals, as used in the

8

1919 Pittman Act, did not include the sand and gravel at

9

issue here because these common earthen materials in the

10

Nevada desert were not included in the contemporaneous

11

legal understanding of the term mineral when the act was

12

passed in 1919 and these materials did not have intrinsic

13

value at the time of the enactment of the act in 1990 --

14

1919 and at the time of the patent granting in 1940.

15

QUESTION:

Does the gravel excavation take up

16

what?

17

total surface area or?

18

About 16 to 20 acres out of some 500, which is the

MR. McCRUM:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

That's --

19

that's the approximate size at the time BLM conducted its

20

report in 1999 or so.

21

QUESTION:

Do we know, is that the sum total of

22

the gravel that's there?

23

the -- another 100 acres or so?

24

MR. McCRUM:

25

Could they -- does it go on for

We have photographs of the site in

the joint appendix of the case that show the area of the

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

-- of the land in the general vicinity to be essentially

2

the same.

3

much covering that whole general area.

4

It's common.

Sand and gravel is -- is pretty

Now, the Pittman Act's structure reserved

5

valuable minerals to the Government in section 8, and at

6

the same time it did that, it provided that those reserved

7

valuable minerals would be subject to location and

8

development by others.

9

expectation of how this -- how these materials would be

At that time, the -- the

10

developed, whatever was reserved as valuable minerals, was

11

under the 1872 Mining Law which itself applied to valuable

12

minerals.

So those were --

13

QUESTION:

14

referring to is 1919 or 1940?

Are you now -- the time you're

15

MR. McCRUM:

16

At that -- in -- in the act itself, it provided

1919, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

for location to occur of the reserved valuable mineral

18

estate under the 1872 Mining Law.

19

it's quite important to look --

20

QUESTION:

So, therefore, it's --

Mr. McCrum, you left out one word in

21

the Mining Law.

22

said, valuable mineral deposits, and there's a significant

23

difference between -- a lump of silver might be

24

tremendously valuable, but it wouldn't be a deposit if

25

that's all there was.

It didn't say valuable minerals.

It

1

MR. McCRUM:

Your Honor is -- is correct that

2

valuable mineral deposits is the -- is the language

3

referred to in -- in 30 U.S.C., section 22 of the 1872

4

Mining Law.

5

valuable mineral lands.

6

viewed as quite similar by the Interior Department at the

7

time, and the question was whether a particular type of

8

mineral was -- was within the class of minerals that the

9

1872 Mining Law was subject to.

10

30 U.S.C., section 21 actually refers to
And those terms were really

And in 1919, if an individual sought to

11

establish a mining claim for common sand and gravel,

12

claiming a discovery of valuable minerals in 1919, it is

13

quite clear and certain how the Interior Department would

14

have addressed that in 1919.

15

denied the patent and rejected the application of the 1872

16

Mining Law to common sand and gravel.

17

Interior would have quickly

Now, we know that because we can look to the

18

published Interior Department decisions of the day which

19

were published at that time, as they are now, available

20

for citizens, as well as the Congress to -- to look at.

21

And the repeated decisions from 1901, in particular,

22

through 1919 made it very clear that common earthen

23

materials, such as clay, sand and gravel, used for road

24

base, cement-making purposes, things of that nature, were

25

simply not subject to the -- the Mining Law.

1

QUESTION:

2

Management have done in 1940?

3

Now, what would -- what would Land

MR. McCRUM:

In -- by 1940, the -- the Interior

4

Department had modified its view in 1929 and there said

5

that -- that sand and gravel could be subject to the

6

Mining Law if valuable on a site-specific basis.

7

under that modified view, adopted by Interior in 1929 in

8

the Layman v. Ellis decision, it confirmed the importance

9

of assessing the marketability on a site-specific basis.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McCRUM:

And

At -- at the time of the patent?
At -- well, the Layman decision

12

involved a -- a question of whether it was valuable at the

13

time of the patent in that case, which was a Mining Law

14

patent being considered.

15

Department, looking at the -- at the position that Layman

16

v. Ellis took, applied that in the context of a mineral

17

reservation, as we have here, and said in the context of a

18

mineral reservation, if it's to include these -- these

19

common materials, it can only include those materials when

20

there is value at the time of the patent.

21

QUESTION:

22

that position.

23

or what?

24
25

And then in 1956, the Interior

You say the Interior Department took

How?

MR. McCRUM:

Was that a -- a solicitor's opinion

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

a solicitor's opinion in 1956.

That was in

It's a solicitor's opinion

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which this Court took note of in the Western Nuclear

2

decision in 1983 and -- and relied on.

3

QUESTION:

Well, Western Nuclear certainly cuts

4

the other way from your argument here today.

5

agree with the holding, but that was the holding of the

6

Court.

7

but certainly very similar.

8
9

I didn't

It was under a different act, not the Pittman Act,

MR. McCRUM:

Justice O'Connor, the Western

Nuclear decision did hold that gravel could be reserved

10

under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916, but

11

importantly, the issue of whether that sand and gravel had

12

to be valuable at the time of the patent was not addressed

13

in the holding of the Court, as the Government has

14

acknowledged in its brief.

15

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't that because the word

16

valuable didn't include in the -- wasn't included in the

17

reservation of Stock-Raisers Act?

18

MR. McCRUM:

It -- it could well have been --

19

that -- that could have been part of the Court's thinking.

20

In -- in the Pittman Act, we do have an emphasis on the

21

term, valuable minerals, in the plain language of the

22

statute, and certainly that is a further reason why the

23

element of value is all the more important in this case,

24

both at the time of enactment in 1919, as well as at -- at

25

the 1940 patent.

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Why couldn't it be that the -- the

2

word valuable doesn't mean at the time of the patent?

3

means reserves the mineral rights, and if and when they

4

prove valuable, the Government will assert its right.

5

mean, one could imagine a metal that was not considered

6

worth anything.

7

uranium.

8

tremendous value of that metal.

9

because when the patent was granted, no one had any idea

10

how valuable this would be, therefore when it turns out

11

that it is indeed very valuable, the United States hasn't

12

any reserved rights?

13

It

I

Let's just suppose that was the view of

And then years later, one realizes the

MR. McCRUM:

Would one say that, well,

Well, Your Honor, that -- that

14

could be a possible construction, but in this case the

15

Interior Department in the 1956 solicitor's opinion took

16

note of the common nature of sand and gravel and how

17

widespread it is across the western public domain and

18

recognized that there was a need to look at -- at value on

19

a site-specific marketability basis, which was actually

20

consistent with the -- the approach the Department took in

21

the Layman v. Ellis decision in -- in 1929, looking at the

22

site-specific marketability of sand and gravel, because

23

unlike a precious metal like gold which, once you extract

24

it, it can be sold on an international market without

25

regard to transportation costs and has intrinsic value,

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sand and gravel and -- and similar materials are -- are

2

common and widespread across the western public domain

3

and, in fact, across the country.

4

you have a market on a site-specific basis that you can

5

have value established.

6

QUESTION:

And it is only where

What would happen, though, if you --

7

what -- would any bad thing happen if the words were

8

interpreted to mean any mineral at all that ever becomes

9

valuable in the future so that then a person who bought

10

this land could never take anything off of it?

11

Government would have the right to all the dirt.

12

that he -- anything that the individual sold, he couldn't

13

sell.

14

it.

15

happen?

16

The
Anything

It would be the Government that would have to sell

Now, if you took that interpretation, what would

MR. McCRUM:

Justice Breyer, if -- if you took

17

that interpretation, you would have western landowners

18

essentially being -- having a very, very limited surface

19

-- surface estate interest that would essentially be at

20

the discretion of the Government where when local -- local

21

demands for these materials arose, the Government at any

22

time could come in and assert that they have ownership of

23

these widespread common materials which would actually

24

destroy -- potentially destroy the value of the land and

25

-- and further, eliminate any private incentives to

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

develop the private land, which was the intent of Congress

2

in 1919.

3

QUESTION:

One -- one way to -- to rule for your

4

client here would be for the Court to hold that it is not

5

a mineral if it can't be removed without disturbing the --

6

the surface, and that certainly would resolve this case.

7

I'm hesitant to say that, though, because of the placer

8

mining of gold, et cetera.

9

MR. McCRUM:

Could you comment on that?

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

We are not

10

advocating such a rule, although it certainly in this case

11

bears -- is certainly a significant factor that this

12

common, widespread material actually would essentially

13

destroy the surface of the land.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, that's what's bothering me.

15

What -- what are we to do with that factor?

16

see how you can get the gravel without completely

17

destroying the -- the surface use that -- that the owner

18

might want to put to it --

19

MR. McCRUM:

20

QUESTION:

21

owner.

22

that choice.

23

I just don't

Well --

-- assuming there's a different

This -- this happens to be the owner that makes

MR. McCRUM:

Yes.

Justice Kennedy, it's just

24

that type of factor that have caused the vast majority of

25

State and Federal court decisions that have addressed the

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

question of whether gravel is a reserved mineral in any

2

type of private conveyance and cases involving the

3

Government where they acquire a surface interest that have

4

caused these -- the Federal and State courts to rule

5

almost uniformly that gravel is not a -- a reserved

6

mineral in the absence of some express intent to indicate

7

that it should be reserved.

8
9

QUESTION:
that boat too.

Of course, but you're -- you're in

I mean, you -- you acknowledge that if the

10

sand and gravel was valuable at the time the patent was

11

issued, the Government would -- would own it under the

12

mineral reservation.

13

you'd have to chew up the surface land to -- to get at it

14

with a commercial value.

15

So, I mean, despite the fact that

MR. McCRUM:

Right?

Well, Justice Scalia, we -- we --

16

so, I mean, we have two positions here and -- and one is

17

that sand and gravel was -- was not reasonably within the

18

-- the meaning of this phrase as it was -- was used in

19

1919 considering the common legal understanding which had

20

-- had been developed by the Interior Department quite

21

clearly between 1901 and 1919 that made it very clear that

22

-- that common, widespread sand and gravel was not what

23

the -- was not what was considered to be a valuable

24

mineral at that time.

25

QUESTION:

Well, if it wouldn't be considered a

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

valuable -- I mean, that -- that does bring you into --

2

into contradiction of our prior cases because if that --

3

if that were so, it wouldn't have been considered a

4

mineral either, it seems to me.

5

MR. McCRUM:

That's correct, Justice Scalia, but

6

we -- we -- in this case we do have the further express

7

language of -- of valuable.

8
9

QUESTION:

Yes, the problem is you have Western

Nuclear, which said that gravel was a mineral.

Now you've

10

got a statute in the Pittman Act that says valuable

11

minerals, which brings you to your fall-back position

12

which is that if at the time of patenting the land it

13

wasn't valuable commercially, then it isn't covered.

14

that right?

15

MR. McCRUM:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

Is

If -- if

16

the Western Nuclear precedent is followed and applied to

17

the 1919 Pittman Act, then our -- our primary position is

18

that the material was not valuable at the time of patent.

19

QUESTION:

It's a little odd in this Pittman Act

20

because it -- it does in section 8 refer to valuable

21

minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just

22

says minerals.

23

MR. McCRUM:

In -- in section 8 of the Pittman

24

Act, it -- the statute makes it quite clear that only

25

valuable minerals are reserved.

And then it -- in -- in

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

later parts of that section, it refers to, and the mineral

2

so reserved shall be disposed in accordance with law.

3

don't think that changes the -- the meaning of the

4

reservation, and it's further confirmed here by the actual

5

patent issued by the Interior Department in the joint

6

appendix where only valuable minerals are reserved in the

7

patent.

I

8

QUESTION:

Suppose --

9

QUESTION:

Is that term used in any other act

10

that we'd be concerned with the term, valuable minerals,

11

as a reservation?

12

MR. McCRUM:

Not as a reservation that I'm aware

13

of, Your Honor, but it is -- is, of course, quite similar

14

to the language used in the 1872 Mining Law which

15

described what -- what -- how -- what would be done with

16

the reserved mineral estate.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose -- and -- and it's only a

18

supposition -- that we were to reconsider our -- our

19

earlier case, Western Nuclear, and -- and overrule it.

20

-- it seems to me that then -- then there would be chaotic

21

lawsuits to follow because there would not -- not have

22

been intentional trespasses but the wrong people would

23

have been extracting the minerals if there had ever been a

24

-- a grant by the Government to -- to a person other than

25

the owner of the fee.

It

Is there any precedent in the Court

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for how we unwind the -- the clock, or whatever the

2

metaphor is?

3

MR. McCRUM:

Well, as we -- as we point out in

4

our reply brief, Justice Kennedy, the amount of land that

5

is potentially subject to contract issued by the

6

Government for gravel on reserved mineral estates appears

7

to be on the order of less than two-tenths of 1 percent of

8

the lands patented under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.

9

So the vast majority of private lands at stake would --

10

would not be affected by a ruling except to the extent

11

that it would confirm that the landowner has the common

12

sand and gravel that -- that was part of the land

13

conveyed.

14

QUESTION:

But your fall -- your fall-back

15

position would extend only to Nevada, I take it, and the

16

fact that it was valuable would be distinguishing from the

17

Western Nuclear case.

18

MR. McCRUM:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The -- the

19

Pittman Act itself applies solely in Nevada and regardless

20

of whether the Court were to reconsider Western Nuclear,

21

we think that Western Nuclear should certainly not be

22

extended to this act which has the term, valuable

23

minerals, express in the statute and where the time of

24

patenting issue was not addressed by Western Nuclear, as

25

the Government acknowledges.

There's no issue of stare

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decisis if -- if the Court is to say the time of patent is

2

paramount, as the Interior Department itself has held in

3

the 1956 solicitor's opinion and as the Tenth Circuit

4

ruled in the Hess case only last fall.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. McCrum, I don't understand what

6

your response to Justice Ginsburg's question is under your

7

fall-back position.

8

uranium which was not regarded as a valuable mineral when

9

the patent was issued and nowadays is regarded as a very

10

valuable mineral?

fall-back position?

12

That is to say, what do you do with

What happens to uranium under your

MR. McCRUM:

Uranium is

Oh, it is now.

It wasn't then.

that the 1872 Mining Law applied.

QUESTION:

It has --

Well, why is it if it's not valuable?

22

I mean, that -- that's the problem.

23

at the time of patenting, what do you do with it?

seems to me that if -- if your argument is going to be

25

consistent, you're going to say the -- the Government

MR. McCRUM:

Justice Souter, the -- uranium is

QUESTION:

No, but you're changing the

hypothesis.

6

valuable at the time of the patent, but we have now

discovered uses for it so that it is valuable, what do you

do with uranium?

9

position would be the Government loses on uranium too.

10

Justice Scalia's question was, if it wasn't

And I would have thought that your

MR. McCRUM:

Of course, the Court may -- may

11

view it that way, Justice Souter.

12

view it is that uranium is a rare, valuable mineral,

13

similar to gold, silver, lead, and zinc, and it's very

14

QUESTION:

The -- the way I would

Well, I guess you could take the

16

position that a mineral like uranium has some intrinsic

value, very little as of 1919 and more today, but that

18

sand and gravel neither in 1919 nor today has any

intrinsic value as a mineral.

convenience.

QUESTION:

-- nobody disputes that it was a

mineral, which is what the -- what the mining act says.

8

The -- the issue is whether it's a valuable mineral.

your fall-back position, you're placing a lot of weight on

10

the adjective valuable, and that -- that created problems

with -- with uranium.

QUESTION:

In

Didn't we have a case that involved,

was it methane, that was thought not only did it have no

16

valuable.

17

MR. McCRUM:

And

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that would

18

have been the Amoco v. Southern Ute case in 1999.

the question is -- was whether under the contemporaneous

20

understanding in 1909 and 1910 did coal include coal bed

methane.

MR. McCRUM:

Yes.

The -- the Government had

3

initially reserved coal and -- and the question was

4

whether that pure coal reservation extended to the coal

5

bed methane within the coal, and the -- and the Court

6

concluded no.

on to look to the contemporaneous interpretation and

8

understanding at the time.

9

So it -- it is -- it is a case that we rely

And here, sand and gravel was well known.

It

was widespread, and there were repeated Interior

11

Department decisions that said this is not the type of

mineral that is subject to the 1872 Mining Law as a -- as

a valuable mineral.

May I ask you a question about an --

16

And, first, I just want to tell you what my -- my

17

understanding of the argument is and -- and you tell me if

18

I've got it wrong.

19

I thought one of your arguments was that it was

20

important to know whether the mineral was valuable or not

21

at the time of the patent or the deed because the -- the

22

grantee, the patentee, ought to know, in effect, the

23

extent to which his -- his land grant is -- is jeopardized

by the Government's right to come in.

2

that a fair statement?

3

MR. McCRUM:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Souter.

Is -- is

Correct.

My -- my question is this.

If -- if

5

that is the reason for saying we should look to value at

6

the time of the patent, isn't that an argument that is at

7

odds with your position that if the mineral is valuable at

8

the time, it is reserved?

9

that is this.

Because -- the reason I say

There may be gold under the land, but the

10

patentee doesn't know it and the Government doesn't know

11

it.

12

that the person taking that deed is going to be able to

13

know whether, at some point in the future, the Government

14

is going to come in and -- and start drilling a mining

15

shaft in the land.

So that there is no way, at the time the deed passes,

16

So my question is, regardless of what the date

17

at -- at which value is established, isn't it the case

18

that these patentees never really know whether at some

19

future time the Government is going to come in and start

20

drilling?

21

be important?

22

And if that is so, why should the patent date

MR. McCRUM:

Justice Souter, you're -- you're

23

correct that there is -- there's always some level of

24

uncertainty when a party takes land subject to a mineral

25

reservation.

But the distinction that is important that

the Interior Department has long recognized and -- and

2

that the Federal and State courts have recognized is that

3

in the case of a common, widespread material such as

4

gravel, it is -- it is the value at the time of patent

5

which needs to be looked to.

6

QUESTION:

And that's what --

So are you saying basically, look,

7

that's the way we've done it and you ought to defer to the

8

practice?

9

MR. McCRUM:

10
11
12

Is that -- I mean --

QUESTION:

We are -- we are --

-- is that the foundation for your

argument?
MR. McCRUM:

We are saying that this is the way

13

the Interior Department itself has done it, and this --

14

and this is the Interior Department that here is asserting

15

a different rule today.

16

the decisions of this Court have recognized a distinction

17

between common material such as sand and gravel and

18

precious metals and other materials that have intrinsic

19

value and recognized a distinction to look to

20

marketability and local, site-specific factors.

Am I wrong about that?

MR. McCRUM:

Justice Souter, the Government's

position is that they own all the common sand and gravel

Does the Government say that it -- that this was

a valuable mineral in 1940 when the patent was issued?

And if not, when did it become valuable?

MR. SANSONETTI:

The United States is saying

20

that the sand and gravel was, indeed, valuable as a matter

21

of a category of minerals.

22

of sand and gravel was valuable actually, we're saying, as

23

Pittman Act in 1919 was the exact time that sand and

25

gravel was valuable.

In other words, the category

QUESTION:

2

I mean, people buy topsoil.

And, you know, if you're in

3

an area where -- where a lot of people need topsoil, I

4

suppose you'd say dirt is valuable.

5

MR. SANSONETTI:

In that case I wouldn't,

6

though, Your Honor, because topsoil also mixes both

7

organic and inorganic materials.

8

that the Court set out in Western Nuclear was four-legged,

9

and the four-part test for a mineral was that it be

And the test that the --

Extractable from the soil was the second leg.

QUESTION:

What if -- what if you had only sand,

which wasn't covered by Western Nuclear?

16

MR. SANSONETTI:

That would not be a problem in

it gets absolutely everything except for the 6 inches or

7

And I don't even understand why they wouldn't get that too

8

if they wanted it.

9

MR. SANSONETTI:

Yes, yes.

I mean, and -- so

Now, I think that the first

10

thing we have to do is take a look at the purposes of the

passage of both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the

12

Pittman Act.

13

QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking the Government

14

gets absolutely everything with the possible exception

15

because of the fourth point of Western Nuclear that I'm

16

not sure why it even came in, but that if it's mixed with

17

something you could grow something in, then they don't get

it.

But everything else is the Government's.
MR. SANSONETTI:

Surface, yes.

Minerals, no.

20

The -- the Justice is -- Justice Breyer is -- is correct.

21

The degree that the surface has been given to the

22

patentee, the patentee has total control of the surface --

23

QUESTION:

So and then -- if it's so, then at

24

this time what this amounted to what seemed to be giving

25

the land away -- it amounted to a lease or a right to use

2

giveaways were.

3

grow crops and nothing else.

4

And that's all these great

They were simply a right to use land to

MR. SANSONETTI:

Initially the answer to that --

5

that question is yes because if you look at section 3 of

6

the Pittman Act, it refers to an affidavit that must be

7

signed by the patentee coming onto the land, and that

8

affidavit states that they are applying for this patent

9

for the purposes of reclamation and cultivation and it

states that they are not there as an agent for any other

corporation, mining company, or anything like that.

QUESTION:

Basically --

All right.

Then that whole argument

14

would be that's certainly a possible reading of the lease.

on the surface that is usable for commercial purposes

QUESTION:

MR. SANSONETTI:

If they wanted to use the sand

and gravel as part of their surface operation as in the

farming where you want to gravel a road, when you turn it

14

into cement, as was done in this case -- the farmer Butler

that obtained the patent in 1940 used some of the sand and

gravel to make concrete to provide patios, et cetera.

QUESTION:

It's a

Well, that's the whole problem

because they say a person who went out to Nevada and

invested his time in this knew perfectly well that they

weren't going to find copper.

that the Government might come in and take all the dirt

But if you had told him

So that's -- that's why he says they've made

this historical distinction between something that has

intrinsic value, a precious metal then or now, uranium or

gold, and something that's widespread and commonly found,

dirt, copper -- dirt or gravel or sand.

in that second category, I'm sorry, you just can't dig

these -- these great big holes.

MR. SANSONETTI:

And when you're

And that's -- that's what we

have here.

15

keep in mind the difference between the dirt and the

the sand and gravel which may be a humble mineral compared

to gold or silver.

We have got a gigantic hole.

Let me note that --

QUESTION:

May -- may I just interrupt to ask?

But the point is is that sand and gravel, as far

in Soderberg, though, that quoted that -- favorably that

MR. SANSONETTI:

public lands that early?

2

MR. SANSONETTI:

In -- in fact, with the passage

3

of the 1872 Mining Act, that was the first opportunity

4

under that law for people go after sand and gravel.

5

was not until 1947 with the passage of the Mineral

6

Materials Act that you could obtain sand and gravel either

7

by locating it through the 1872 Mining Act or obtaining a

8

contract for lease.

9

sale.

That changed.

It

That contract for

Excuse me.

10

And that changed in 1955 with the passage of the

11

Common Varietals Act where the only way you could obtain

12

sand and gravel today -- well, ever since 1955 -- is by

13

sale contract.

14

and you say you want 10,000 cubic yards of sand and

15

gravel.

16

bid to take each cubic yard out, and once that is out, of

17

course, the 35 cents goes to the United States Government,

18

Treasury, and the remainder, of course, goes for the sale

of the sand and gravel.

QUESTION:

Are you -- are you suggesting that

2

because the grantee in this case was -- was a commercial

3

operation, somehow the -- the value of the grant or the

4

terms of the grant had changed?

5

MR. SANSONETTI:

Well, the -- the terms of the

6

grant did not change, but I think we have to keep in mind

7

exactly what the purpose of the statute was.

8

was Congress' intent to concurrently develop the surface

9

of these lands and the mineral estates.

And here it

The goal was to

10

get new farmers to farm, new ranchers to ranch, while

11

leaving the mineral estate to those that would be able to

12

exploit that mineral and were after the mineral because

13

they wanted to be mineral operators, not because they came

14

on the land as farmers.

15

This was the problem with all the fraud that was

16

going on under the old land classification system where

17

people would come onto the land saying this is non-

18

mineral.

19

soon as they'd get the patent to everything, including the

20

surface and -- and the minerals, they were selling out to

21

the coal companies.

I want it to be an agriculturalist, and then as

22

And that's what brought out the 1906 reservation

23

of the coal, and then you have the 1909 act which says the

24

patentee gets everything but the coal.

25

and 1919 we have these two acts that say, nope, we're now

And then in 1916

going, Congress says, to a split estate system where the

2

surface goes to the surface grantee, the patentee, and a

3

mineral operator must come to the United States to get any

4

type of mineral.

5

QUESTION:

Let me get something clear about the

6

-- the Department of Interior's position.

7

ever since 1872 they had taken the position that sand and

8

gravel was -- was mineral.

9

they had taken that position only with respect to sand and

10

gravel that was removable in -- in commercial quantities?

11

MR. SANSONETTI:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SANSONETTI:

You said that

But isn't it the case that

That is correct.

Not all sand and gravel was minerals.
That -- that is correct.

And

14

that's where the test of Western Nuclear comes in.

15

want to know whether something is a mineral or not, you

16

apply the test.

17

QUESTION:

If you

Let's -- let's go back before Western

18

-- I think Justice Scalia's question -- I don't think your

19

answer is consistent with what the Government did in the

20

Zimmerman case, the Department, which was questioned

21

later.

22

was not a -- it was not regarded as a mineral, was it?

23

But certainly at the time of Zimmerman, it -- it

MR. SANSONETTI:

Well, Zimmerman in -- the

24

Zimmerman case was -- was the Department of the Interior

25

case that counsel has been referring to, Zimmerman, which

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was in 1910, that said that sand and gravel did not equal

2

mineral lands.

3

it was -- it was a mineral.

4

note about this.

5

So up until 1910, the question was, yes,
And the things -- things to

First of all, Zimmerman was specifically part of

6

the Western Nuclear case and is rejected at pages 45 and

7

46 of that opinion.

8

The second thing is is that that opinion, issued

9

by the Department of the Interior, was never tested in the

10

courts.

It is certainly --

11

QUESTION:

Well, wait a minute.

Does that mean

12

an opinion -- say, an agency opinion -- has no value if

13

it's never been tested in the courts?

14

MR. SANSONETTI:

No, but it does mean that

15

there's a difference between the Department of the

16

Interior's ability to inform the Congress at the time that

17

this act passed in 1919 and their ability to bind the

18

Congress.

19

Congress that that meant that sand and gravel fell out

20

from the definition of valuable minerals in 1919,

21

particularly since in 1919 sand and gravel was the fifth

22

largest value of minerals produced in the United States

23

that were nonmetallic.

The solicitor's opinion is not binding on the

24

QUESTION:

25

and gravel value concentrated?

Yes, and where -- where was that sand
It was concentrated on the

east coast because of World War I, wasn't it?

2

MR. SANSONETTI:

No.

Actually as -- as you can

3

see in the joint appendix, pages 56 through 118, there are

4

a series of annual mineral reports that were utilized in

5

both of the -- the district court case and the appellate

6

court case in -- in BedRoc, that spell out that by 1911,

7

there was already a national association of sand and

8

gravel producers, including associations of State sand and

9

gravel producers, in 14 different States.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SANSONETTI:

12

QUESTION:

13

14 States?

14

Where -And -- and Nevada is included.

And where -- and where else were the

If you don't have it handy, don't --

MR. SANSONETTI:

Michigan, Texas, California,

15

and I would note, I believe, it is at joint appendix -- I

16

believe the page is 56 that shows that sand used for the

17

making of glass had already been discovered in Nevada as

18

of 1918.

19

So -- and -QUESTION:

Well, that just -- that just proves

20

that sand and gravel in certain places is valuable.

21

That's conceded by the other side.

22

that -- is whether sand in the Gobi Desert is -- is

23

something that's worth anything.

24

Interior Department never took the position that all sand

25

and gravel is -- is minerals under the Mineral Act until

Right?

The issue was

QUESTION:

MR. SANSONETTI:

You could locate sand and

gravel from 1872 up to 1910.
QUESTION:

You could locate it if it was

commercially valuable, yes.

11

MR. SANSONETTI:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct.

That's not the question I asked.

13

When is it that the Department first came up with the

14

position that all sand and gravel, no matter where it is,

15

is covered by the mining laws?

16
17

MR. SANSONETTI:

I don't know the exact answer

to your question, but I can say in regard to this --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SANSONETTI:

Is it after -- is it after 1940?
It's before 1940 because in

20

1919 the Department of the -- as of 1919, the Congress had

21

stated that sand and gravel is a valuable mineral.

22

QUESTION:

Then how do you explain the 1956

23

solicitor letter -- opinion -- the DOI solicitor who said

24

that -- that there's a reservation only if the gravel had

25

a definite economic value because of the proximity of a

MR. SANSONETTI:

It was that -- okay, first of

3

all, the 1956 solicitor's opinion was also reviewed by

There were other elements being

Note that we are here -QUESTION:

There's -- there's another -- there's

12

another piece from the Department of the Interior that Mr.

13

McCrum emphasized in addition to the 1956 opinion letter,

14

and it was a heading or a sentence in the Western Nuclear

15

brief, in the SG's brief, stating that the reservation

16

embraces only gravel deposits that are economically

17

exploitable and would justify an entry under the 1872

18

Mining Act.

19

McCrum, that issue wasn't before the Court and the

20

Government said, indeed, the issue is it has to be

21

economically exploitable at the time of the patent.

So in Western Nuclear, according to Mr.

Well, but that -- that can't be

11

correct, can it, because one uses the term valuable and

the other doesn't?

13

prevail over the statute.

14

MR. SANSONETTI:

And the House report certainly doesn't

It does not prevail over the

15

statute except let me come back to the question about the

16

two words being -- the two phrases being different because

17

section 8 of the bill -- again, Pittman was passed after

18

the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and the actual quote is

19

that section 8 of the Pittman Act contains the same

20

reservations of minerals which was passed by Congress in

the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.

All right.

16

You wanted to finish what you were saying.

17

MR. SANSONETTI:

If -- if I may, the position of

18

the United States is that those two phrases, valuable

19

minerals and minerals, are synonymous.

20

definitely has a meaning.

21

Western Nuclear as being used for commercial purposes.

22

used for commercial purposes, the concept of value is

23

definitely part of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and

24

consequently, it means the mineral must be valuable.

25

The word valuable

That meaning was set out in
So

In Pittman, you've got again the exact same

the word valuable.

of those sections, and it is our -- our position then that

What's bothering me in the

14

And therefore, what's really at stake is the

And once I begin to think in that way, I think

15

that whoever might want to sell or buy some of this land,

16

which now might be used for a city or a town or who knows

17

what, might think to himself, well, I can deal with the

reservation of, let's say, a specific precious mineral

19

right like gold or even tungsten or even uranium.

20

there's a possibility here that the Government can come in

and start digging, because the mixture of organic only

goes down about 6 inches, and if everything below that 6

inches potentially belongs to the Government, and the

just don't know what I'm getting into.

would be pretty reluctant to buy this piece of land, or at

5

And therefore, I

Now, it's that kind of uncertainty in land

6

transfer title that is coming on 100 years after the event

7

that's worrying me.

8

me what you think of that.

9

So I would like you to reply and tell

MR. SANSONETTI:

Let -- let me try it in -- in

10

this fashion because we're talking about expectations here

11

and what the patentee, the surface owner, is obtaining and

12

how it passes that on to successors.

13

The United States was saying through the

14

Congress through both of these acts that the mineral --

15

through the mineral reservations that you, the patentee,

16

can come onto the surface of this land, use it as you

17

will.

18

anything that may be found on or underneath that land that

19

has mineral value.

20

as his benefit of the bargain and should not expect

21

anything else.

MR. SANSONETTI:

Well, to the extent that

16

there's any doubt on -- on the Court about whether or not

17

gravel is a mineral reserved to the United States in the

18

Pittman Act reservation, we feel it should be resolved in

favor of the Government due to the old canon of

construction that says that about the scope of land grants

MR. McCRUM:

One point that I'd like to make as clear as I

Thank you.

possibly could is that sand and gravel was not locatable

5

under the Mining Law from 1872 onward.

6

Interior Department was as clear as could be in published

7

decisions that common material like sand and gravel and

8

clay were not subject to the 1872 Mining Law, not within

9

the class of valuable minerals.

It -- it -- the

The -- the first

10

published decision we see on this is in the 1880's and we

see a repeated line of cases from 1901 through 1919.

MR. McCRUM:

I have great respect for my

opponent, Mr. Sansonetti, but I -- I think that this point

19

that I'm making is -- is as clear as could be in the

20

record.

21

And the Zimmerman case is not an isolated case.

22

It's merely a case in 1910 that is stating this very

23

explicitly in the case of sand and gravel that this was

24

actually the general understanding and that the Department

25

was not even receiving applications for sand and gravel

Not -- it was

By then, in 1897, in the Pacific Coast Marble

case, the Interior Department had already ruled that

marble was a valuable mineral, which is an eminently sound

ruling looking at the marble in this Court building, which
