CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Conservation v. the Environmental Protection Agency.

Mr. Franklin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FRANKLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The question in this case is whether the Federal

12

Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to

13

override by fiat a discretionary determination that

14

Congress expressly directed be made instead by the State

15

of Alaska, which Congress trusted to exercise its own

16

independent judgment according to local priorities and

17

local conditions.

18

question is no.

19

We submit that the answer to that

When Congress wanted to give EPA the authority

20

to -- under the Clean Air Act to review and approve the

21

substance of individual State determinations of the best

22

available control technology, or BACT, Congress said so

23

expressly.

24

of this case.

25

It gave EPA no such role in the circumstances

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that the statute

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allows EPA to at least say, Alaska, you didn't go through

2

the proper analysis here, you didn't consider, as

3

contemplated by the statute, some of the costs and

4

concerns that would enable a State to say, fine, you go

5

ahead with less than the ultimate equipment?

6

EPA, under the statute, say, Alaska, you just didn't

7

follow the required procedures?

8

MR. FRANKLIN:

Now, can

EPA can say, yes, Alaska, you did

9

not consider the statutory factors, but that is not the

10

contention that's being made in this case, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that an element here in

12

fact?

13

the owner of the mine wouldn't even furnish certain

14

financial information to enable the State to make that

15

analysis?

16

Wasn't that part of EPA's concern?

MR. FRANKLIN:

Is it true that

Two points, Your Honor.

The

17

contention that's being made here is not that Alaska

18

failed to consider the factors that Congress set forth.

19

The contention is that they didn't do it in the way that

20

-- that EPA might have done it if EPA were the permitting

21

authority with regard --

22

QUESTION:

Well, that's a -- that's a pretty

23

fine line.

24

your concession.

25

rational interpretation of the statute is that, yes, the

I mean, I'm -- I'm really surprised by -- by
I -- I would have thought a much more

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State has certain obligations under the statute to

2

consider the factors, but if they were not considered, the

3

person who would bring them to account for not considering

4

them is initially the State courts and then, on

5

certiorari, to this Court.

6

that this is none of EPA's business --

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

8

QUESTION:

I thought your position was

It is our --

-- that this -- that this

9

discretionary determination is given to the States, and

10

when the States are reviewed, they should be reviewed in

11

court.

12
13

MR. FRANKLIN:

That is our -- our position, Your

Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't it for -- for the --

15

for the hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives as well

16

as for everything else?

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

I think that the -- the line is

18

whether the requirements of the statute were followed or

19

not.

20

it --

21

In this case, Alaska has done precisely that which

QUESTION:

Well, assuming they weren't followed,

22

is your position that when they are not followed, EPA can

23

call them to account?

24
25

MR. FRANKLIN:

EPA has the authority to enforce

the requirements and prohibitions of the act, but we

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

believe that authority should be narrowly circumscribed to

2

the bounds that Congress set for the EPA.

3

QUESTION:

Well, let -- let me intervene and --

4

and suggest this.

5

O'Connor's question this way?

6

complain and make its case that the State did not exercise

7

its discretion the right way, but it can't do so by just

8

issuing an order.

review process.

10

Could you have answered Justice

It has to go through the judicial

Would -- would that -- would that answer

MR. FRANKLIN:

QUESTION:

13

Oh, yes, the EPA can -- can

Yes.

-- or am I misstating the theory

here?

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

No, you're not, Your Honor.

The

15

-- the question in this case is not whether the claims

16

that EPA raises here will be subject to review.

17

question is how, when, and in what manner, and --

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

The

Now, could -- could the EPA

19

have gone to Federal court and say, oh, well, this

20

discretion was exercised in good faith and so forth, but

it was -- it was wrong?

It didn't comply with the

MR. FRANKLIN:

In this case, no.

-- as Justice O'Connor said, it

didn't give -- oh, it cannot go to Federal court?

MR. FRANKLIN:

Not in this case, Your Honor.

there's an open question as to whether --

QUESTION:
it?

Well, why couldn't it?

It

Why couldn't

They simply proceed under 28 U.S.C. 1345.
MR. FRANKLIN:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Now, what they do is they say, we're

11

now in Federal court.

12

State law happens to say that you cannot be arbitrary.

There's a State law here.

13

MR. FRANKLIN:

14

QUESTION:

The

Correct.

And so now they say, we're making the

15

same claim identically.

16

abuse of discretion.

17

my goodness, what is this case about?

They were arbitrary, capricious,

But it's under State law.

18

MR. FRANKLIN:

19

QUESTION:

And now,

Exactly.

You say that they should have gone

20

into the Ninth Circuit under 1345 arguing it was

21

arbitrary, capricious under State law, and they say that

22

they should be in the Ninth Circuit arguing that it's

23

arbitrary and capricious under Federal law, where I've

24

never heard that there's any difference between arbitrary

25

and capricious under State law or under Federal law.

It's

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

just whether it's arbitrary and capricious.
MR. FRANKLIN:

There are two important

3

differences, Your Honor, and -- and I think they would

4

have -- 1345 is the statute I was just about to cite, and

5

I think they would have the authority to go into Federal

6

court under State law.

Two important distinctions.

7

First, Your Honor, the -- the -- going through

8

the State process would require that they go through, in

9

addition to the State judicial review process, the State

10

administrative review process.

11

allowed Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation

12

a de novo administrative hearing at which they could have

13

presented a full administrative record, additional

14

witnesses, and they would have had the opportunity to

15

further clarify and defend their decision.

16

In Alaska, that would have

The second point, Your Honor, is that under the

17

fiat that they have exercised here by order, it does not

18

accord Alaska's determination the kind of deference that

19

it would have received under the State process.

20

The point that we're making, Your Honor, is that

21

the State review process is adequate to address all the

22

concerns --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

They do go into Federal court, and I

do see your point.
What I am curious about is I think there are

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

like maybe a handful of administrative law experts who

2

might have thought there was really some kind of

3

difference between whether you're in Federal court under

4

the State words or in Federal court under the Federal

5

words when the words are identical.

6

somebody who thinks there's a difference between what you

7

told Justice O'Connor and what you've told Justice Scalia,

8

but I'm not one of them.

9

reconcile those things.

10

And there may be

I don't understand how you

So if we assume Congress is not an expert, why

11

wouldn't they have just meant by this, well, EPA, you stay

12

out of it unless you think what they're doing is

13

unreasonable?

14

unreasonable, you have the authority to come in and go to

15

Federal court if you want.

16

Everybody would understand it.

17

If what you think they're doing is

MR. FRANKLIN:

That would be simple.

If Congress had made that clear

18

in the statute, Your Honor, we would not be here.

19

reason that Congress did not is that when Congress wanted

20

to give EPA the authority to review and approve the

21

substance of individual State BACT determinations, it said

22

so expressly in section 7475 --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FRANKLIN:

25

QUESTION:

The

Mr. Franklin -Yes.

-- perhaps I misunderstood your

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

brief, but I thought that you were making the distinction

2

in your brief between the substance of a decision and the

3

procedural motions.

4

Alaska agency simply said, well, the company wants Low

5

NOx, so they're going to get it, and we're not going to go

6

through any feasibility analysis.

7

conceded that if that were the case, there would be access

8

to the Federal court on the part of EPA.

9

I thought you conceded that if the

MR. FRANKLIN:

Yes, Your Honor, but that is not

10

what we are here about today.

11

today is EPA --

12

QUESTION:

I thought your brief

What we are here about

Well, why isn't it, going back to

13

Justice O'Connor's question, when the EPA is saying, in

14

essence, you didn't really go through the feasibility

15

analysis because you didn't even ask for the relevant

16

information?

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

To get back to that, Your Honor,

18

the -- what EPA is saying is that we did go through the

19

factors, but we didn't weigh them the way EPA would.

20

And with respect to the economic considerations,

21

Your Honor, Alaska has followed EPA's own guidance on this

22

which says quite clearly that the individual circumstances

23

and finances of a permit -- an applicant are not to be

24

considered in the analysis.

25

whether the technology would have bankrupted this company

So it was not relevant

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or not.

What Alaska found to be relevant and what it was

2

its statutory prerogative to find relevant and as a matter

3

of its own local priorities was a comparison of the costs

4

between this applicant and other similarly situated

5

applicants in recent decisions.

6

QUESTION:

So you want --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Franklin, it's not just a

8
9
10

question of coming into Federal court.
MR. FRANKLIN:
QUESTION:

No.

It's not just a question of the

11

agency coming into Federal court the way a private citizen

12

would and challenging the State action.

13

the agency issuing an order --

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

15

QUESTION:

It's a matter of

Exactly.

-- which order is presumptively valid

16

and which would have to be deferred to by the Federal

17

court presumably unless the order was arbitrary or

18

capricious.

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

20

QUESTION:

And that is what I was --

So you'd be deciding in Federal court

21

whether it was arbitrary or capricious for EPA to find the

22

State to have been arbitrary or capricious, a very -- a

23

very refined determination, to put it mildly.

24

MR. FRANKLIN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is --

But isn't that the problem?

It isn't

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

just a matter of getting into Federal court.

2

matter of how you get into Federal court.

3

MR. FRANKLIN:

Exactly.

It's a

As I was saying before,

4

it's not a question of -- of whether these things will be

5

reviewed but how, and more specifically, whether these

6

issues which are --

7

QUESTION:

But it is.

There's a difference

8

because you're -- you said that the review -- the

9

reviewing authority would be the State court.

So you

10

aren't talking about whether there would be Federal court

11

review, and I think in response to Justice Scalia, now you

12

are saying that the route is the State court.

13

agreeing with him when he said the route is the State

14

court and this Court on cert.

You're

15

Do you see any role for the Federal courts?

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, as Justice Breyer pointed

17

out, it's an open question.

18

courts -- if EPA were instituting this, the State review

19

procedure, under section -- 28 U.S.C., section 1345, there

20

may be Federal jurisdiction because that confers original

21

Federal jurisdiction on any action brought by a Federal

22

agency.

23

We believe that the Federal

But that's a narrow, limited scope.
QUESTION:

Well, but the action has to properly

24

lie in order for it to be successful, and when you have --

25

on what basis would the agency be suing?

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FRANKLIN:

They would be suing under the

2

State review procedure, Your Honor.

It would be their

3

option we think, and it's an open question.

4

that I think this Court --

It's not one

6

Suppose that the -- a State agency decides the

I don't think they could do it.

8

they brought up to New Orleans -- from New Orleans.

9

bought it and brought it up to Alaska.

Now, EPA looks at

10

that and says, no, no, this is going too far.

11

in your opinion is supposed to happen?

12

MR. FRANKLIN:

They

Now, what

Well, in -- in our opinion in

13

that situation, Your Honor, it would be subject to the

14

APA-type review and it would be struck down.

15

question is not whether that kind of review of --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

Again, the

What's the role of the Federal court?
Well, if EPA is the one bringing

18

the action, I -- I would accept Your Honor's premise that

19

once it has proceeded through the comment process, once it

20

has proceeded through the administrative review process --

21

and frankly, we think that that particular matter would

22

end there.

23

their responsibilities seriously to implement these

24

statutes.

25

No State would do that because the States take

If, however, there were any question that

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

remained at the end of that process, which EPA

2

circumvented in this case by fiat, then and only in that

3

event would EPA be able to seek judicial review, but it

4

would be an APA case.

5

QUESTION:

It would not be --

Well, I don't -- I don't understand

6

anyway because the statute that we're looking at, section

7

113(a)(5) says that if EPA finds a State is not acting in

8

compliance with any requirement or prohibition of the PSD

9

program --

10

MR. FRANKLIN:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- EPA can stop construction and

12

issue orders.

13

injunctive or monetary relief.

14

It can also bring a civil suit for

Suppose it just puts out an order and says,

15

look, Alaska, you did not determine what costs would mean

16

to the mine in terms of profitability, employment, or

17

global competitiveness, and therefore you didn't meet the

18

requirements of the PSD statute, and you stop any

19

construction now on the mine expansion.

the onus on the mine owner or the State to go to court

21

somewhere, wouldn't it?

22

MR. FRANKLIN:

That would put

It would and -- and that's

23

precisely the reversal of the kind of presumption of

24

regularity that the States are entitled to in these kinds

25

of cases.

QUESTION:

Mr. Franklin --

2

QUESTION:

So under 17 -- or what is it --

3

7413(a)(5)(C), which is 14a of your brief toward the

4

bottom, you say that in this case the agency cannot invoke

5

that section to issue an order or to go to court.

6

MR. FRANKLIN:

7

QUESTION:

8
9
10

That is correct, Your Honor.

All right.

You have to say that to

be consistent.
MR. FRANKLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, if you want us to write the

11

opinion your way, you would say under 17 -- 7413(a)(5),

12

the State -- the EPA cannot issue an order barring

13

construction unless.

14

Now you fill in the blank.

MR. FRANKLIN:

Unless a State has -- if there

was a demonstrated violation of an express statutory

16

requirement.

For example, a State has not --

to come up and say, there was a -- there was a violation

What your formulation is, is that

just don't see how that gets you there.

13

QUESTION:

And I

You're making a distinction between

14

the express requirements of the statute and the obviously

15

implicit requirements of the statute?

16

is implicit in the statute that the State's decision must

be made rationally and not arbitrarily.

18

that that's a requirement of law?

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

Certainly it -- it

Don't you think

It is certainly a requirement of

law, Your Honor, but it is a background principle that

21

derives ultimately, we think, from the Due Process Clause

22

It doesn't seem to be limiting the

2

authority of EPA.

3

sure I totally follow the argument, but I'm just looking

4

at the -- that statutory provision.

5

that statutory provision does not apply even if the State

6

acted arbitrarily and capriciously?

7

And I'm just wondering just -- I'm not

MR. FRANKLIN:

And are you saying

The statute governs how the

agency's -- gives the agency the discretion.

9

the agency exercises that discretion is a separate

How the --

10

question and one that is traditionally reviewed on a full

11

administrative record by a court, not by EPA acting on its

12

own fiat.

13

QUESTION:

Well, but this -- that provision

14

gives the -- the EPA the authority to issue certain

15

orders.

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

And is it your position that they did

18

not have the authority to issue the order here or that the

19

order was wrong?

20

MR. FRANKLIN:

Our -- that they did not have the

21

authority because there was not a -- a violation of the

22

requirements of the act, which is the only basis --

23

QUESTION:

Even if there were a violation of the

24

requirements of the act, would you say they -- if -- if

25

there were a violation of the act, would they have the

authority to issue it -- issue that order?

2

MR. FRANKLIN:

If there -- if there were a

3

violation of the express requirements of the act, then --

4

then that's what the statute says.

5

in context.

6

when Congress wanted to give EPA the authority to review

7

and approve the substance of these determinations, it said

8

so expressly in one narrow instance that is not applicable

9

here.

10

But it has to be read

It has to be read in context.

Particularly

When a State has -QUESTION:

That's in advance of the permit.

The

11

fact that -- that Congress specified that for certain

12

pollutions, you must, before you give any permit, go to

on what the statute means to this extent.

EPA didn't like the way they did

There seems to be lurking in this a -- a difference

EPA seems to be taking a single source approach.

21

That is, you want a new generator?

22

have BACT for that generator.

23

voluntarily you're going to put Low NOx on all of them and

the result would be lowering the emissions.

this.

You go at it machine by machine --

MR. FRANKLIN:

3

QUESTION:

Right.

-- generator by generator, where

4

you're taking the position or Alaska is taking the

5

position that if you can reduce overall emissions by

6

putting the Low NOx on all six generators and in the end

7

have cleaner air, well, then do that and forget about the

8

SCR on one machine.

9

difference about whether BACT applies to the whole setup

10
11

That seems to be a substantive

or machine -- generator by generator.
MR. FRANKLIN:

Yes, it is, and we believe that

EPA is -- is wrong on that.

14

the discretion to weigh, among other factors,

15

environmental factors.

16

enough for the State to take into consideration the

17

overall environmental effect that this --

18

QUESTION:

But they're wrong as a matter

The BACT statute gives the States

We think that is clearly broad

But that's -- it's either that you go

19

at it machine -- source by source, new source by new

20

source, modification by modification, or you can have the

21

bubble concept.

22

bubble concept and the Court -- this Court said, EPA,

23

that's a reasonable construction of the statute.

24
25

In Chevron, EPA was -- was espousing the

Now EPA seems to be saying as to this program
there is no bubble.

You have to look at that machine,

1

that generator in isolation.

2

MR. FRANKLIN:

3

QUESTION:

Right.

And that seems to be a basic

4

difference on what the statute means, not on -- mix it all

5

up and is it arbitrary and capricious.

6

MR. FRANKLIN:

We think that it's -- in fact,

7

there is a difference on -- on how it's to be implemented.

8

Congress was very clear here.

9

would have different policies, that one State could choose

10

the approach that EPA might choose, which says we are not

11

going to consider the environmental -- overall

12

environmental impact here.

13

differently, but that's what Congress wanted to have

14

happen.

15

They understood that States

Another State might view it

When EPA issued its orders in this case -QUESTION:

But on the facts here I thought --

16

now, tell me if I'm right about this.

17

reading it, I was quite sympathetic to your view that it

18

makes no sense to have more emissions coming out as a

19

result of trying to control this one generator.

20

is to get fewer emissions not more.

21

into the record a little bit, it seemed to me that the

22

facts are that by the time this generator 17 came up, it

23

was perfectly apparent that the company had to put the --

24

whatever, some low technology, NOx technology or something

25

on four of the other generators anyway.

When I started

But then when I read

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

So that the bottom line is that this bubble has

2

nothing to do with this case because we're talking about

3

one generator coming in in circumstances where the other

4

generators have to be controlled regardless.

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

Am I right?

You're almost right, Your Honor,

6

but the -- the difference is that there -- there were four

7

other generators that were subject to the cap, but there

8

were six other generators total.

9

QUESTION:

I know, but then we -- I had my law

10

clerk go through and do the extra emissions from those

11

other two, and it didn't really make any difference.

12

MR. FRANKLIN:

13

difference, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FRANKLIN:

It did -- it does make a

It does?
Because of the assumption that

16

Alaska made, and that is that if you used SCR on MG-17 --

17

and this has never been challenged -- that -- that MG-17

18

would be the backup generator.

19

Therefore, any emissions savings that you can get off

20

those other two engines, 2 and 6, no matter how small they

21

might be -- and I think that they probably come in the

22

neighborhood of 100 tons or so.

23

that you can get off 2 and 6 add to the bottom line

24

because the assumption that the State has made, which is a

25

-- a reasonable and in my view correct assumption, is that

It would not be used.

Any emissions savings

MG-17 is not going to be used if it's SCR because SCR has

2

enormous operating costs associated with it.

Again, these were the -- the policy
determinations --

QUESTION:

If I go --

QUESTION:

I still don't -- I don't -- I don't

7

see where Justice Breyer's question fits with -- with the

8

issue, does the statute dictate BACT on an individual

9

generator?

Never mind the rest.

In other words, does the

10

act say, no bubble, and that's how EPA seems to be reading

11

the act, that it's not a matter of discretion, that this

12

calls for a new source, modified source, and you just look

13

at that new source and you don't look at the old

14

generators at all.

15

MR. FRANKLIN:

You look at the new source, Your

16

Honor, but you're allowed to consider environmental impact

17

in looking at it.

18

contention.

19

require States, nor could they, to use their top-down

20

methodology.

21

this case -- that the BACT determination is not supposed

22

to be a uniform Federal standard.

23

And there EPA is wrong, if that's their

Their -- for example, they -- they do not

EPA understands -- and that is the nub of

What -- what other method is there

recommends, but it isn't inevitable.

9

QUESTION:

Is that in fact the situation, that

10

there are other ways, or is it just in theory, but they

11

all use top-down?

12

MR. FRANKLIN:

Your Honor, I don't know what

13

every State uses, but I do know that Congress made clear

14

-- and the legislative history at page 31 of the Senate

15

report is crystal clear on this point -- that each State

16

was to have the discretion to weigh the factors in its own

17

judgment.

18

it would be permissible for a State to consider such

19

things as anticipated and desired economic development, as

20

well as the amount of the available increment that the

21

State wished a particular source to consume.

22

And -- and Congress made clear that a State --

QUESTION:

When --

Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, the -- the

23

difficulty that I'm having with -- with your argument

24

about the meaning of the statute goes back to your answer

25

I think to Justice Kennedy's question awhile ago.

He

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

asked you, in effect, what's the role of the statute on

2

your theory, and -- and you said, well, if they -- if they

3

simply ignore one of the stated statutory factors, they

4

say we're not going to consider this, or if there's a

5

technical defect in the order, if the order is incomplete,

6

that would be a -- a circumstance in which EPA could

7

exercise this authority.

8
9
10

But you also said -- and I -- I assume you said
correctly -- that later on that these kinds of obvious
violations are going to be rare.

11

MR. FRANKLIN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

And that leads me back to -- as I

13

said, I guess, to Justice Kennedy's question, and that is

14

this.

15

statutory sections, there really isn't very much role for

16

them to play, and I can't imagine why Congress would have

17

enacted separate order sections if all they were meant to

18

do is what you say.

19

It seems to me that on your view of the -- the two

So my question is, why -- why doesn't your

20

explanation trivialize these two statutes to a point that

21

is implausible?

22

MR. FRANKLIN:

They don't trivialize it, Your

23

Honor.

24

State does not meet those express statutory requirements,

25

then EPA can step in.

There are numerous Federal requirements that if a

QUESTION:

And -- and EPA could do the same

thing by following the State review process, couldn't it?

4

MR. FRANKLIN:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

forgot X.

It --

It could go in and say, look, they

They refused to apply Y.
MR. FRANKLIN:

But if its contention is one that

8

the statute gives the discretion but it was simply not

9

exercised in the proper way that we would have exercised

10

it, that is not a contention that Congress wanted EPA to

11

be able to resolve by fiat.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, that's -- that's

13

the question.

14

that if -- if it is unlikely that Congress would have

15

provided this entire separate track simply to deal with

16

the problems that you say the track is meant to deal with,

17

then it is not so implausible at all that Congress would

18

have intended the statute to be applied as it has been

19

applied here.

20

I mean, the -- the difficulty I'm having is

MR. FRANKLIN:

I think it is implausible because

21

Congress made clear that EPA's authority was circumscribed

22

to enforcing the -- the statutory requirements, and those

23

requirements were met in this case.

24

If I might reserve the balance of my time.

25

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Franklin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. HUNGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Petitioner's fundamental contention is that once

7

a State issues a determination of best available control

8

technology so labeled, no matter how arbitrary, factually

9

unsupported, or unreasoned it may be, the Federal

10

Government has no enforcement authority under the act to

11

take actions to stop the invalid permit from taking

12

effect.

13

act supports the implausible contention that Congress

14

intended to immunize arbitrary, unreasoned State decision

15

making from Federal enforcement review.

16

Nothing in the text, structure, or history of the

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think he is -- I mean,

17

my impression of their argument was, yes, you can review

18

that.

19

then after you go through the State procedures, in fact,

20

you can go into a Federal court and have them apply the

21

State review procedure if you want.

What you have go is through the State procedure and

MR. HUNGAR:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, but --

I think that's what their argument

was, or at least one of their arguments.
MR. HUNGAR:

But, Your Honor, Congress enacted a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

Federal regulatory scheme and a Federal enforcement

2

scheme.

3

QUESTION:

That's a different thing.

Maybe

4

yours is better, but you can't say they're leaving it

5

without review.

6

So I just wanted to --

MR. HUNGAR:

Review only under State law, Your

7

Honor, and -- and our point is that Congress has enacted a

8

comprehensive Federal regulatory scheme and authorized EPA

9

to serve as a backstop to ensure compliance with all of

10

the requirements of the act, or this -- this portion of

11

the act.

12

QUESTION:

That's begging -- I mean, that --

13

that is exactly the point at issue, it seems to me.

14

is -- why is it irrational to envision a scheme such as --

15

such as the petitioners here propose, which is, look it,

16

Congress set certain, absolute requirements?

17

quality, you know, shall be this.

the Federal court as

10

Number two, the question is not merely which

the permitting agency that all of these requirements have

been met.

4

So under petitioner's interpretation, EPA's

5

authority to enforce all of -- all of the requirements of

the prevention of significant deterioration program would

7

be eviscerated to the extent there is discretion in those

8

determinations and there is necessarily discretion.

9

of those other determinations require modeling, and to do

All

10

modeling, you have to determine what the inputs to the

11

model are and you have to determine what the boundaries of

12

the ambient air area are, and if EPA cannot review any of

13

those discretionary decisions, it has essentially no

14

authority to do anything under this act except to require

15

that permitting authorities mouth the words of the

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, they -- they didn't determine

6

the maximum degree that is achievable, taking into account

7

these factors, because the only basis for their rejection

8

of the best technology selective control -- I mean,

9

selective catalytic reduction was their reliance on

10

economic impacts, and specifically what they said was the

11

foremost consideration -- the foremost consideration --

12

for their rejection of SCR, according to the State -- this

13

is at page 208 of the joint appendix -- was impact of the

14

cost of SCR on the competitiveness of the mine.

MR. HUNGAR:

that?

What's wrong with that, Your Honor,

20

is that on the previous page, on page 207 of the joint

provide the financial information, they had no basis for

making a judgment.

Suppose at the

3

end of the day -- and I'm not sure this is what we would

4

do or that I would favor, but suppose at the end of the

5

day we agree EPA had authority to issue a stop order and

that it was proper.

well, okay, we're going to run through this drill once

8

more and do consideration of costs, and they're now going

to allow Low NOx's instead based on that?

do that?

Could Alaska then go back and say,

absolutely they could do that.

QUESTION:

Can you tell me, Mr. Hungar, whether

intervened in any State administrative review proceedings

in State courts?

MR. HUNGAR:

In State court, no, I don't believe

Has -- has it gone to

MR. HUNGAR:

I don't believe so.

It's an

6

unsettled question I think whether 1345 would authorize

QUESTION:

So the EPA has been consistent in

saying that it -- it is not in any case like this or with

10

parallels to this gone through an administrative review

process.

12

It's simply issued a stop order?
MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct.

The EPA has

13

consistently maintained and -- and has -- has announced

14

this interpretation in a variety of administrative

15

documents, including through notice -- in the course of

16

notice and comment rulemakings and in the very orders in

basis of which the EPA acted.

5

through the State administrative procedure, that record

and -- and you would examine the record before the State

10

We -- we do not

Now, if you had gone

That would -- the action in

But -- but the administrative action we're

11

reviewing here is not the State administrative action.

12

It's your administrative action, and the only relevant

record is the record before the EPA.

14

before, the court of appeals ends up determining whether

15

it was arbitrary and capricious for the EPA to determine

16

that the State agency was arbitrary or capricious.

17

And -- and as I said

You combine those two weird factors and -- and

18

I'm just dubious that this is the kind of review that

19

Congress intended.

20

MR. HUNGAR:

Taking the last part of your

21

question first, Your Honor, there's nothing particularly

22

strange about an appellate court reviewing a prior

23

determination of whether an agency decision was arbitrary

24

and capricious.

25

Courts do that all the time --

QUESTION:

MR. HUNGAR:

-- under the APA when a district

2

court -- no.

If a -- a district court determines whether

3

a -- whether the -- an agency decision was arbitrary and

4

capricious, the court of appeals, to the extent there are

5

discretionary issues, they would review deferentially, but

6

really as a general matter, it's going to boil down to a

7

question of law, which is I think the case here, which is

8

was it -- was it or was it not arbitrary and capricious

9

for the State of Alaska to do what it did here.

10

Fundamentally that is a question of law upon review of the

11

EPA's determination.

12
13

QUESTION:

All right.

It's a question of

judgment and whose judgment gets some weight.

14

In respect to that, what I'd really suddenly

15

stirred up again here -- suppose we reach the second

16

question.

17

did, in fact, do something that was pretty unreasonable,

18

and suppose I accept your argument that this was totally

19

unreasonable to say that they didn't have to put in this

20

special technology because of cost when Alaska didn't even

21

know what the cost was.

That's close to the ceiling fan.

23

arguing.

24
25

Suppose we reach the question of whether Alaska

That's about like the fan.
That's what you're

But then they've made another argument, and the
other argument is bothering me a lot more.

And that is

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the EPA has taken the position that you have to put

2

this extra special converter or whatever on number 17,

3

even if the consequence of that, because of the

4

interaction of the regs and their desires with number 2

5

and number 6, is more pollution.

6

because it seems to me a State agency that's trying to get

7

a result that is less polluting is not acting arbitrarily

8

and capriciously except in rather unusual circumstances.

Now, that does bother me

9

Now, what do I do with that argument?

10

mean if I accept everything you say -- but that worries me

11

-- I should send it back for another determination of

12

whether this really is arbitrary and capricious?

13

should I do with that argument?

14

MR. HUNGAR:

Does that

What

Your Honor, the State agency did

15

not justify its final permit decision on that rationale.

interpretation of the text of this statute.

that EPA was taking an anti-bubble approach, that it said,

11

MR. HUNGAR:

As a matter of law, what EPA has

12

determined in -- in exercising in -- its rulemaking

13

authority is that the statute requires that once it's

14

determined that the BACT analysis must be made, it must be

15

made on an individual unit basis, which is exactly what

the State ultimately did here.

that.

Spear and given the particular circumstances of this case

where the agency -- where EPA was not simply issuing an

order to someone saying you're violating preexisting

requirements of the act, but was in fact changing the

status quo and stating that a -- a permit that had been

issued by the State that allowed construction could not

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

that this Court's precedents regarding final orders are

satisfied and that this is indeed a final order because it

imposes legal obligations, new legal obligations, on

us that the reviewing court can have the full State record

Is that -- is

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, in this case it's -- although

21

they had extensive record materials before them, the --

22

the flaw in the State's decision making is apparent on the

23

face of the State's own decision.

It is -- it is theoretically possible that if they

This is merely argument in their appellate

And what is clear on the record is that under --

5

if the State had adopted SCR as BACT, the total cap on

6

emissions allowable by this facility would be hundreds of

tons lower than the cap that was imposed by the State.

8

That's undisputed and perfectly clear that SCR would

9

result in a total emissions cap far lower than the one

10

that the State wanted to impose.

11

argument, unsupported by any findings, is that -- is the

12

sheer speculation that Cominco would spend millions of

So, do I -- I understand you to say

that they would be forced -- I take it you're --

implicitly you're saying they'd be forced to use this

only way that they, in fact, could comply with the cap?

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.

If -- if they
