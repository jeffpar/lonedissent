CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
next in No. 02-8286, Delma Banks v. Doug Dretke.
Mr. Kendall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case presents three issues, two arising

11

from purposeful and recurring misconduct by the trial

12

prosecutors, and a third from constitutionally deficient

13

defense counsel.

14

to disclose discoverable material to the defense.

15

knew that Robert Farr would testify as a key witness at

16

each phase of trial, and they knew that he was an

17

informant and had been paid for his services.

18

Prior to trial, the prosecutors promised
They

Mr. Farr did in fact take the stand at both

19

phases of this trial.

He denied he was an informant.

He

20

denied he received any consideration for his work.

21

denied tipping off the authorities that Mr. Banks would be

22

taking a trip to Dallas.

23

for arrest. The prosecutors knew that when Mr. Farr gave

24

his testimony it was not truthful.

25

their feet and ask Mr. Farr to correct this testimony.

He

He denied setting up Mr. Banks

They did not rise to

1

QUESTION: And it - is it your contention that

2

this is a basis simply for setting aside the sentencing

3

phase of the trial?

4

MR. KENDALL: We have asked this Court to affirm

5

the district court, who - who did grant relief on death

6

sentence.

7

on - on the Mr. Farr claim.

8
9

We're not asking for relief on guilt innocence

QUESTION: All right.

I'm - I'm - I'm somewhat

puzzled by that, but you have three different claims to

10

discuss here and I don't want to take too long.

11

would seem to me that, if it - if - if this is the

12

evidence at trial, that - that there's no additional

13

obligation or special obligation at sentencing where that

14

becomes really a secondary matter.

15

It - it

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, the reason why we take

16

that position is that his testimony at the punishment

17

phase is absolutely critical for the state to get the

18

death penalty in this case.

19

that.

20

testimony was crucial.

21

Banks had returned to Dallas to get a gun so that Mr.

22

Banks could on the return trip commit armed robberies and

23

take care of and eliminate witnesses.

24
25

The district court recognized

The Fifth Circuit in this case said that that
What he told the jury was that Mr.

There was no other testimony that came close to
matching that at the punishment phase, and the state had
4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.

2

Banks would be a danger in the future.

3

satisfy that -

If they didn't

4

QUESTION: Well, but - but you - you have the

5

burden, don't you, to show that the outcome would have

6

been - would have been different had the - had the state

7

come clean at the beginning?

8

- you assert that - that he would not - a jury would not

9

have judged him as harshly if the jury had known that he

10

was going to get the gun in order that Farr could commit

11

robberies with - with apparently his assistance, rather

12

than what Farr had told them, namely that he had gotten

13

the gun in order that he would commit future robberies,

14

right?

15

whether he's getting the gun to let somebody else kill or

16

getting the gun to kill himself?

17

And as I understand it, you

And you think that would have made the difference,

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, Mr. Banks denied at

18

trial that he had any intent to commit any crime

19

whatsoever with regard to this robbery.

20

made it clear -

21

QUESTION: Understand.

And Mr. Farr had

But - but - but you're

22

saying he admitted that - that he got the gun so that Farr

23

could commit robberies, right?

24

MR. KENDALL: We think there's a world of -

25

QUESTION: And that would have - would have 5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would have tapped a wellspring of mercy in the - in the

2

jury's breast?

3

that much difference.

4

I - I don't really see how it would make

MR. KENDALL: No, Your Honor.

The point is - is

5

that the - the state could not ask the jury to impose the

6

death sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable

7

doubt that Mr. - there was a strong likelihood that Mr.

8

Banks would commit acts of violence in the future.

9

think there's a clear difference, and the trial

We

10

prosecutors recognized this, between Mr. Banks going to

11

get a gun so that Mr. Banks could rob and kill, as opposed

12

to providing instrumentality.

13

But more importantly, Your Honor, Mr. Farr

14

recanted that testimony at the Federal hearing and that

15

recantation was found credible by the district court.

16

QUESTION: Recanted what testimony?

17

MR. KENDALL: No one had the intent to rob

18

anybody.

That was a ruse that Mr. Farr used -

19

QUESTION: Banks admitted that himself.

20

MR. KENDALL: No.

Mr. Banks admitted on the

21

stand that he had finally agreed to accompany Mr. Farr to

22

Dallas to get a gun.

23

denied that he had any intent whatsoever to commit any

24

crime, and he flatly denied that assertion.

25

this was a ruse that Mr. -

But Mr. Farr denied - Mr. Banks

Mr. Farr -

QUESTION: What - what - what was - what was the
gun going to be obtained for?

Self-defense?

3

MR. KENDALL: It was -

4

QUESTION: These people were being -

5

MR. KENDALL: - it was a ruse -

6

QUESTION: - threatened by somebody?

7

MR. KENDALL: Justice Scalia, it was a ruse that

8

Mr. Farr used that was not true -

9

QUESTION: Oh, that - that explains -

10

MR. KENDALL: - to -

11

QUESTION: - why Farr got it.

12

It doesn't explain

why Banks got it.

13

MR. KENDALL: But that was not the theory that

14

the case - that the prosecutors asked the jury to conclude

15

beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Farr would - that Mr.

16

Banks would be dangerous in the future.

17

court granted relief on that and we think that clearly we

18

have shown materiality on that point.

The district

19

QUESTION: As to materiality -

20

QUESTION: But he - I take it you do not agree

21

that you have to show that the result would have been

22

different?

23

MR. KENDALL: We - we do not agree with that.

24

fact, we believe that this Court has not retired the

25

Alcorta and Napue standard, and - and it shouldn't use
7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In

1

this case.

The - the standard in Alcorta and Napue that

2

says if the Government puts up perjured testimony, that if

3

there's a possibility that that testimony affected the

4

judgment or if the judgment is reversed.

5

acknowledge that this Court in Brecht did provide a rule

6

generally for habeas corpus that is different from that

7

rule.

8

where there are cases where there was a pattern of

9

misconduct, that the Brecht rule might not apply.

We do

But it said in footnote 9 of that decision that

There

10

is clearly a pattern of misconduct by the Government in

11

this case.

12

QUESTION: Well, you have to show cause and

13

prejudice, and I thought that under Strickler, the - the

14

necessity of showing prejudice requires that you show that

15

there is a reasonable probability that the sentence would

16

have been different.

17

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we've not -

18

QUESTION: You - you don't think you have an

19

obligation to show reasonable probability -

20

MR. KENDALL: We do.

21

QUESTION: - that the sentence would have been

22

different.

23
24
25

We do, and - and -

MR. KENDALL: We do, Your Honor, and the district
court QUESTION: You - you acknowledge that you have to

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

do that or?

2

MR. KENDALL: On - on cause, we do, Your Honor,

3

and we - we - we've met that clearly.

4

submission here that Mr. Farr's testimony was critical -

5

QUESTION: Alcorta was a case on direct review?

6

MR. KENDALL: It was a habeas case, Your Honor,

7

but the Court has not distinguished between -

8
9
10

So it's our

QUESTION: But decided long before a lot of our
other habeas cases, which have somewhat limited the
relief?

11

MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor, but the

12

Court, since Brecht, in - in subsequent cases, in - in

13

Kyles and in Strickler, has continued to refer to the fact

14

that there's this category of misconduct that has always

15

been treated differently, and we do not see why it

16

shouldn't be applied here.

17

given the importance of Farr in this case to the state's

18

case that we meet the reasonable probability standard, or

19

whatever the - other standard the Court would impose on

20

us.

However, we believe that,

21

The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court -

22

QUESTION: May I ask you whether the record shows

23

that counsel for Banks and Banks thought Farr was an

24

informant back in 1980?

25

MR. KENDALL: There was repeated effort by trial
9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

counsel to answer that question.

2

counsel specifically asked the chief investigator, who's

3

your informant?

4

to tell you.

5

guilt phase and at the sentencing phase, counsel asked,

6

are you working for the state, are you an informant?

7
8

And the investigator said, I'm not going

When Mr. Farr was on the stand, both at the

QUESTION: Well, so there was a suspicion of that
back in `80?

9
10

At a pre-trial hearing,

MR. KENDALL: And I think after trial, given the
-

11

QUESTION: But then 16 years went by.

12

MR. KENDALL:

13
14

Yes, Your Honor, because there

were QUESTION: And - and this wasn't evidence that

15

was under lock and key.

16

weren't easily available.

17

There were witnesses.

They just

MR. KENDALL: Your - Your Honor, there was - it

18

was very difficult for us to obtain this proof.

19

had every right to belief the - given the fact that the

20

prosecutors had said, Mr. Farr has been truthful with you

21

in every way, that whoever the informant was in this case,

22

it was not Robert Farr.

23

We - we

We only began to think differently about this

24

when we finally got access to another of the critical

25

state witnesses, Charles Cook, who told us in 1992 that
10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

some of his testimony was not truthful.

2

QUESTION: Suppose we find that the - or - or

3

conclude that the defense counsel was not as diligent as

4

it ought to have been on this point.

5

excused by the prosecution's failure to present the Brady

6

material?

7

Is that somehow

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we think that we acted

8

reasonably and diligently in post-conviction.

We were

9

misled by the state, and in fact, we used that state

10

habeas - we filed in - in - in 1992 the claim on

11

information belief Farr was an informant in this case.

12

QUESTION: Well, it's - there's perhaps a slight

13

difference in being misled and simply a - a case in which

14

the prosecution does not come forward with Brady material.

15

There - they may be some distinction in the two.

16

the standard that you would have us apply in this case to

17

rule for you with reference - if - if we base that ruling

18

on the prosecution's failure?

19

Brady?

20

What is

Is it just a standard

MR. KENDALL: That would be under Strickler.

Our

21

view is that because of the misrepresentations in this

22

case, we were - we were allowed to rely on those

23

misrepresentations.

24

informant status in the state habeas proceedings, but we

25

couldn't get the evidence to prove that.

We wanted to litigate Farr's

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: What -

2

QUESTION: But specifically the

3
4

misrepresentations were what?
MR. KENDALL: Were that Farr had - had - had

5

denied that he was a paid informant.

He was a paid

6

informant, and the prosecutors in their closing arguments

7

told the jury that he had been completely -

8

QUESTION: Okay.

9

MR. KENDALL: - truthful in every way with you.

10

QUESTION: Had they also not given, or - or

11

before trial had they not also said, we'll give you

12

everything in the file?

13

MR. KENDALL: They said, you don't have to file a

14

discovery motion, we will disclose to you material that is

15

discoverable, and this clearly was discoverable material -

16

QUESTION: Okay.

17

QUESTION: - when they put him on the witness -

18

QUESTION: But they didn't - the defendant didn't

19

ask to discover anything.

The prosecutor said, you know,

20

everything is available to you.

21

MR. KENDALL: He -

22

QUESTION: What did - what - what did he ask for?

23
24
25

What did defendant ask for?
MR. KENDALL: He filed a standard discovery
motion, but the - the Government long before that said,
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you don't have to file a motion, we'll provide material

2

that's discoverable to you.

3

- the state has tried to say that it, even by calling an

4

informant, it does not have to reveal -

And there's no argument - the

5

QUESTION: Did - did -

6

MR. KENDALL: - that status.

7

QUESTION: - did - did the defendant get anything

8

after the prosecutor said, you don't have to file any

9

formal motion, we'll give you everything you're entitled

10
11

to?
MR. KENDALL: It - the prosecution revealed prior

12

convictions on its witnesses.

It did not disclose Mr.

13

Farr's informant status or arrangement.

14

disclose with regard to Charles Cook.

It did not

15

QUESTION: Were there documents -

16

QUESTION: Okay, but -

17

QUESTION: Were there documents or arrest reports

18

to show Farr's informant status, or was this just a - a -

19

a circumstance where the prosecution should have said

20

orally that this is his status?

21

MR. KENDALL: When we finally obtained what was

22

represented to us to be the full prosecution file in this

23

case, there was not one notation in there with regard to

24

Mr. Farr, identifying him as an informant.

25

obliged to -

They were

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION: So then there - you're not complaining
that documents weren't turned over?

3

MR. KENDALL: That's correct.

4

QUESTION: You're complaining that the - that -

5
6

They -

that a statement was not made by the prosecution?
MR. KENDALL: That - that we believe the law

7

required them, once they decided to put this informant on

8

the stand, to disclose that factor to the defense.

9

QUESTION: Because it was Brady material?

10

MR. KENDALL: Because it was Brady material.

11

QUESTION: All right.

Now, may I go back to

12

Justice Ginsburg's question?

You - you - you gave us some

13

examples of - of material that was turned over to you

14

under this policy in - in which it was not necessary to

15

file a motion.

16

response - to you in response to a specific request from

17

you, or did they simply come up with this and say, this is

18

the material that you could get if you moved for it?

Was that material turned over you in

19

MR. KENDALL: It was turned over after a general

20

discovery motion was filed, but that discovery motion was

21

never taken up at a hearing.

22

This was disclosed -

QUESTION: All right.

Did the general discovery

23

motion refer specifically to what they gave you, or was

24

the motion simply, give us everything we're entitled to?

25

MR. KENDALL: It - I believe it said give us
14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prior convictions.

2
3

QUESTION: Well, then that was what they gave
you.

4
5

And -

MR. KENDALL: And that's all that they provided,
that's correct.

6

QUESTION: I mean, the problem that I'm - I'm

7

having with this is, I thought at - and - and I - I - I

8

got into this myself, I realize, but I thought they had

9

said, in effect, we'll give you everything you're entitled

10

to.

11

the problem is mine, but I want to follow it through.

12

They apparently said, you don't have to file a specific

13

motion.

14

did you ask for even though you didn't have to file a

15

specific motion?

16

Now we're getting down to greater detail, and I think

Justice Ginsburg raises the question, well, what

You say that you filed a general discovery

17

request that specifically did ask for prior convictions.

18

They gave you prior convictions.

19

understanding between counsel was, we'll give you what you

20

ask for, but we are not volunteering by our representation

21

to give you anything you don't ask for.

22

correct, then the only reason you would be entitled to

23

this would be an affirmative Brady obligation, whether you

24

ask for it or not.

25

My concern is that the

If this is

Is it the Brady obligation or do you think they
15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had undertaken something more extensive than Brady

2

required?

3

MR. KENDALL: I think that they assured counsel

4

that whether it was - whether they had to disclose

5

something under state law or under Brady, that there was

6

no need for litigation.

7

material -

8
9
10

They would provide Brady

QUESTION: But did they assure counsel that
counsel would not have to ask for it?
MR. KENDALL: The letter - the letter says, you

11

do not have to file a motion, we'll provide you with

12

material that the law requires us to disclose -

13

QUESTION: That the law requires us to disclose?

14

MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION: Material.

I - I would take that to

16

mean documents that we have that you're entitled to, and

17

we don't know that there are any documents reflecting -

18

reflecting Farr's informer status, do we?

19

MR. KENDALL: But, Your Honor, it said in lieu of

20

a motion, and so I think it was fair for counsel to

21

include that there needed to be no litigation about

22

discovery -

23

QUESTION: Well -

24

MR. KENDALL: - that the Government understood

25

what state law and Federal law required.

QUESTION: But maybe there had to be a request,
not litigation, but say, tell me, was he an informant?

MR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor -

QUESTION: Tell me.

5

MR. KENDALL: I think after these assurances, I

Did you ever ask that?

think counsel -

QUESTION: Please answer that question.

8

MR. KENDALL: I'm sorry.

9

QUESTION: Did you ever ask the prosecution

10
11

whether Farr was an informant?
MR. KENDALL: At trial, there's nothing in the

12

record where the prosecution was specifically asked.

14

that he was a paid informant.

QUESTION: Now, when was this?

MR. KENDALL: That was in state post-conviction

proceedings, and the - and he has was required to respond

truthfully to that, and under state law that -

22

QUESTION: He didn't respond falsely.

23
24
25

He just

didn't respond.
MR. KENDALL: But under state law that is a no,
that is a denial.

that is not addressed specifically in the answer is

QUESTION: It was more than that though, wasn't

it?

It - they - in - in fact, the state put it in a

13

general denial.

14

the complaint, including the allegation that Farr was an

15

informer.

It denied each and every allegation of

MR. KENDALL: Well, it's clear that when you read

their answer that the state had denied our allegation that

Mr. Farr was a paid informant in this case.

phase and at the punishment phase.

about Farr's testimony, do we know that counsel knew that

that was a lie?

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there aren't -

QUESTION: I mean, you - well, you can argue it

7

about whether it was his responsibility.

MR. KENDALL: Mr. Elliott gave an affidavit in
state post-conviction that said that he was aware of all

10

the facts pursuant to the investigation and the

11

presentation of evidence in this case.

that, given Farr's important status in this case, there's

no doubt that he knew.

8

the evidentiary in the hearing in this case, we received

9

for the first time a lengthy pre-trial statement that had

10

all kinds of impeachment material in that and that showed

11

beyond any doubt that Mr. Cook had lied in his testimony

12

before the jury that he had not in any way, shape, or form

13

rehearsed his testimony with the state.

14

There was another very

Mr. Cook had

Three months before

From the time of that disclosure until the

evidentiary hearing, it was clear that this transcript

would serve as evidence for us to prove up our claim that

on Mr. Cook.

we're asking only for sentence relief.

With regard to

conviction on the basis of Cook?

MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION: Okay.

9

What - now, what - what was

essential to the conviction that - that he testified to?

10

MR. KENDALL: He - he provided - he had to - the

He said that over and over

MR. KENDALL: Well, what he was asked, the first

2

question on cross-examination was, who have you talked to

3

about your testimony?

4

haven't talked to any about this case?

5

to anybody.

6
7

He said nobody.

He said, you
I haven't spoken

That was a bald-faced lie.

QUESTION: Well, it's on its face incredible
anyway.

You think the jury believed it?

8

MR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, the -

9

QUESTION: They think the prosecutors can just

10

put him on without even asking him what he was going to

11

testify about?

12

MR. KENDALL: Well, they certainly would - they

13

certainly would have believed that if the Government would

14

have disclosed this transcript that showed that three days

15

before trial Mr. Cook had a very difficult time keeping

16

his narrative about this crime straight.

17

QUESTION: How - how does that work?

When this

18

occurs and - and this - these questions are set forth in

19

footnote 4 of your brief - when this occurs, does a Brady

20

obligation arise at that point?

21

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, I think that -

22

QUESTION: I'm the - I'm the prosecutor, I'm

23

sitting there, I hear this guy say that he's never talked

24

to me and I know that he has and I know that I have 71 or

74 pages of notes.

1

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, for decades the Court

2

has said that when a government witness lies, the

3

government attorney has the obligation to correct that.

4

The Brady obligation continues, it's pre-trial and it's

5

during trial.

6

what the government witness says, and it's clear that

7

after Cook gave that answer, that the Government was

8

obligated, one, to have him correct his testimony, but

9

certainly not, after he'd given that testimony, to get up

It can arise during trial depending on - on

10

in front of the jury and say, Mr. Cook was completely

11

truthful.

12
13
14
15
16

QUESTION: But my question is, is there a Brady
obligation?
MR. KENDALL: There is a Brady obligation,
absolutely.
QUESTION: Well, now, is your point - your point

17

is more than just that he said it, he didn't admit that he

18

had talked to other people before trial, is it?

19

MR. KENDALL: No, no, no, because it - it was

20

clear that what the defense was trying to show was that

21

Mr. Cook should not be believed because he's really been

22

worked over by the prosecutors to get his story together.

23

And that's exactly what the transcript that wasn't

disclosed demonstrated.

because he was making so many mistakes and getting things

2

all out of order.

3

They didn't believe he was a credible witness

4

three or four days before trial, and the only reason that

5

he was, or might have appeared credible, was because of

this session.

7

Government had this in their briefcase at trial.

they disclosed the - the brief statement that Mr. Cook had

given four minutes before but not this one.

and said, yes he's the guy, let's litigate this in state

He could have made this very simple

He didn't do so.

different result.

That is clear -

MR. KENDALL: There was mental health evidence.

5

There was testimony about Mr. Vetrano Jefferson recanting

his testimony that - about who was the - who had been the

aggressor in a fight before this crime, and then the

testimony offered by the parents in this case.

MR. KENDALL: All - all going to sentence, Your

This was -

MR. KENDALL: This was only about sentence, Your

testified to by a Dr. Pina, is that it?

23

MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there was no claim that

I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for

QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kendall.

Ms. Bunn, we'll hear from you.

16

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19

MS. BUNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

20

From 1983 to 1996, Banks filed three separate

21

state habeas applications raising numerous claims, but

22

Banks failed to diligently pursue his current Brady and

23

Strickland claims during these state proceedings.

24

elected instead to expend his efforts pursuing other

25

claims.

He

It wasn't until Federal habeas proceedings that
30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

he turned his efforts to developing the instant claims.

2

QUESTION: Did - did the state deny in one of

3

these habeas applications, deny that Farr was an

4

informant?

5
6

MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, the state never denied
it.

It did fill -

7

QUESTION: Well, now wait a minute -

8

QUESTION: Then explain to me what was -

9

QUESTION: - in - in - in the state habeas

10

proceeding, the state submitted a response to the

11

petitioner's petition and denied all the allegations in

12

the petition, which included the assertion that Farr was a

13

paid informant and that the state had withheld that

14

information from Banks.

15

not?

16

The state denied that, did it

MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor.

It is not our

17

interpretation of the record that it did, because this

18

single sentence found in a 145-page petition was buried in

19

a - basically a laundry list of claims of prosecutorial

20

misconduct, at the end of that section containing a great

21

number of other allegations, which the state responded to

22

specifically by saying, first a number of them had been

23

addressed in other sections of the brief, including the

24

Swain claim, and another Brady claim that was fully

25

developed.

And then it responded to the remaining claims
31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by saying that they were all procedural - procedurally

2

defaulted based on the lack of a contemporaneous

3

objection.

4
5

QUESTION: Ms. Bunn, did not the state say, we
deny each and every factual allegation in this complaint?

6

MS. BUNN: Yes.

There was a general denial at

7

the beginning of the - the state's answer to the 145-page

8

brief.

9

However, the context QUESTION: You better be careful what you deny,

10

don't you think?

11

that, even if it's buried in, you know, if it's buried in

12

a lot of other stuff.

13

know, everything's so buried we can't tell what's what,

14

but you didn't say that.

15

every.

16
17
18
19

I mean, each and every would include

I mean, you could have said, you

You said, we deny each and

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and it does appear
that QUESTION: Is it that the case that - do you now
concede that Farr was paid something for his information -

20

MS. BUNN: Yes.

21

QUESTION: - by the state.

22

MS. BUNN: Yes.

23
24
25

Well, not for information.

He

was paid to assist police in obtaining the murder weapon.
QUESTION: Yeah.

And did the state prosecutor

ever disclose that during the trial, even though he said,
32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no, everything's perfectly truthful here?

2

MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor.

The state never -

3

QUESTION: He knew - he knew that Farr was

4

testifying falsely and he - he let that testimony go, and

5

indeed relied on it in his summation to the jury?

6

MS. BUNN: What the trial prosecutor knew -

7

there's nothing in the record to indicate the trial

8

prosecutors actually knew about the money that Bank - that

9

- that Farr was paid several months before the trial in

10

this case by - by police investigators.

11
12

QUESTION: But isn't he charged with knowledge of
what the organization as a whole did?

13
14

MS. BUNN: In the - in the Brady disclosure
context, certainly he is.

15

QUESTION: Wasn't it representative of the police

16

there at the trial the whole time to assist the

17

prosecutor?

18

MS. BUNN: Not that - not that I'm aware of that

19

the police were at the - at - really have testified in the

20

trial.

21

so he did not sit in on - on Farr's testimony or any of

22

the other state's witnesses' testimony.

23

But I believe the rule was invoked in the trial,

But -

QUESTION: Well, I assume we have to take this

24

case on the - the premise that the state somehow knew that

25

the state had paid the money to Farr, and I guess also had
33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

promised some kind of a break not making certain criminal

2

charges?

3

MS. BUNN: There is no evidence of any inducement

4

of that kind to Farr in this case, no evidence of any kind

5

of inducement whether financial or a break in - in any

6

convictions for his testimony, contingent upon his

7

testimony in this case.

8

cases like Bagley and Giglio.

9

That's what distinguishes it from

QUESTION: But are you saying that because he was

10

paid to help get the gun back rather than to testify

11

falsely?

12

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.

That is correct.

13

QUESTION: So that he was paid for a critical

14

role in the scenario that led to the indictment, rather

15

than post-indictment false testimony.

16

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.

That is correct.

17

But again, as far as the cause issue goes, and there is no

18

dispute that the claim is procedurally defaulted to - due

19

to Banks' failure to develop it in - in the state court.

20

The dispute is whether he has established cause, and the -

21

the basis - the focus of the inquiry in cause is the

22

petitioner's conduct, and in this case, the state record

23

makes clear that Banks was aware of this claim and

24

actually alleged the claim in the petition itself.

25

QUESTION: Well, does the petitioner's awareness

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that there is a - a claim supersede the prosecution's

2

obligation to disclose Brady material, and to disclose the

3

fact that one of its own witnesses lied on the stand?

4

MS. BUNN: Not that it supersedes the obligation

5

under Brady, but it does preclude a finding of cause in a

6

case like this where the nondisclosure -

7

QUESTION: So the prosecution can lie and conceal

8

and the prisoner still has the burden to - to discover the

9

evidence?

10

That's your position?
MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, because in a case

11

like this, unlike Strickler, unlike Amadeo, this is more

12

like - more like McCleskey, where the nondisclosure,

13

whether in trial court or in state habeas, did not prevent

14

the petitioner from developing the claim.

15

QUESTION: But it didn't prevent it absolutely,

16

but it made it pretty tough, didn't it?

17

sitting there in January, the prosecution has been not -

18

been denying nonstop that Farr has been paid anything,

19

they're beginning to get some information maybe that isn't

20

true.

21

allegation, and they think they're going to have to find

22

somebody who will prove - who will say that, and they

23

can't find Farr.

24
25

I mean, the -

The prosecution is still denying it by denying the

So what are - what were they supposed to be
doing?

They were looking for witnesses.

They couldn't

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

find Farr.

The prosecution isn't telling them the truth

2

apparently.

3

have done?

And so, what - what is it that they should

4

MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, this case does not

5

present a situation where there is a record developed on

6

what efforts Banks expended on this case.

7

in the record to indicate that Banks' counsel pursued this

8

claim, that they sent investigators out to try to find

9

Farr.

There's nothing

There's absolutely nothing -

10

QUESTION: I didn't say that.

What I said was, I

11

was repeating what he said, that - and when they filed it

12

in January - I don't want to repeat it again, you heard

13

what he said too - and he said they're just learning from

14

Cook some time in 1992 that it might be possible to get

15

evidence that would show what the prosecution was saying

16

was false.

17

So I want your opinion.

You say it's quite

18

clear that they should have investigated this further.

19

Really?

20

Because?
MS. BUNN: Because they were obviously aware of

21

the claim, aware of the potential existence of the claim.

22

They requested no investigative assistance regarding the

23

claim.

They investigated no discovery regarding the

24

claim.

They - while they - what they did do was expend

25

what at that point were pretty extensive resources
36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pursuing and developing their Swain claim and another

2

Brady claim.

3

QUESTION: But you want us to say that the - that

4

the defendant relies on his peril, at his peril, on the

5

representations of the - of prosecution?

6

MS. BUNN: At - in - in a case like this where,

7

unlike Strickler, where the evidence, the - the

8

nondisclosed evidence was not in the sole possession of

9

the state.

It was discoverable as - as actually

10

ultimately have it in habeas, in - in Federal habeas

11

proceedings.

12

Banks was able to procure this evidence.

QUESTION: No, but you are - are - aren't you

13

arguing, just as Justice Kennedy suggested, that what they

14

should have done in this case is to go to the court and

15

say, we want further resources to investigate, and what

16

specifically we want to investigate is an issue which, if

17

we are correct, the state is affirmatively lying about.

18

We want investigative resources to prove that state's

19

counsel is lying.

Isn't that your position?

20

MS. BUNN: Well, yes, Your Honor -

21

QUESTION: And for failure to do that -

22

MS. BUNN: - that would be -

23

QUESTION: - for failure to do that, they're out.

24
25

Isn't that your position?
MS. BUNN: That is part of our position, that

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

essentially the absence of that, the absence of a request

2

for investigative assistance, the absence of any -

3

QUESTION: But, in the - in the - in the face of

4

the state's representation.

5

asked for it, I assume the state would have said, well,

6

we've told them that there isn't anything to this.

7

and - and you would - you're saying that they should have

8

pursued it in the face of that for the purpose, among

9

other things, of proving that state's counsel was lying to

10
11
12
13

In other words, if - if they

And -

them?
MS. BUNN: Your Honor, they - there was an
obligation from them to pursue the claim further, yes.
QUESTION: Why wasn't there an obligation on the

14

part of the prosecutor, having deceived the jury and the

15

court, to come clean?

16

who was subjected to false testimony?

17

prosecutor knows it - why isn't it the prosecutor's burden

18

to come clean at any stage, rather than let this falsehood

19

remain in this record?

20

Why is the burden on the defendant,
Why is - and the

I just don't understand why it becomes the

21

defendant's burden when the prosecutor is best situated to

22

have the information, was this true or not, did we pay

23

this informant or not.

24

obligation on any lawyer who makes a representation that's

25

false to a court?

Why isn't that a continuing

1

MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first - first it is

2

not - that's not the question.

3

petitioner's burden to allege and prove - provide

4

evidentiary support for his claim.

5

It is the habeas

QUESTION: Well, but it is the question if - if

6

Justice Ginsburg is right, that prosecutors have a

7

continuing obligation.

8
9

MS. BUNN: Well, that obligation is essentially
triggered by materiality, so you have that working as

10

well.

11

obligation does not basically preclude a finding of - of -

12

of no cause in a case like this.

13

But that does not - the - the state's continuing

QUESTION: Well, if I were a defense counsel, I

14

could think of a - of a - no more damaging material of

15

cross-examination in this case than to show Farr was paid

16

money to come up with the story.

17

MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, that - that

18

was not the - those are not the facts of this case.

19

There's no evidence and - and Farr has not said in post-

20

conviction that he was paid for testimony.

21
22

QUESTION: Yeah, that's true, but I - I mean,
what -

23

QUESTION: But I think it's even -

24

QUESTION: - what bothers me about your position

25

is, if we were to say that a defense counsel behaves
39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unreasonably when he relies upon an explicit statement of

2

the prosecutor's, such as I deny the allegation, that's to

3

say that the justice system lacks integrity, and indeed it

4

might contribute to that lack of integrity to impose this

5

kind of obligation and thereby excuse a prosecutor under

6

circumstances like this.

7

MS. BUNN: But to find cause in a case like this

8

would essentially be to hold that a Brady claim can never

9

be defaulted because -

10

QUESTION: Of course it can.

All that it

11

requires is that a prosecutor who says, my files are open,

12

who says that we do not, in fact, deny that we paid money

13

for a related purpose to the witness, all it requires is

14

that he be telling the truth.

15

MS. BUNN: And I want to focus also on the - on

16

the record itself and what Banks - Farr was never asked

17

specifically whether he was a police informant, so he

18

never denied that allegation.

19

phase, starting - it - it's in the joint appendix at page

20

37 - in the middle of questioning by defense counsel at

21

the guilt innocence phase about his drug - prior drug use

22

and his drug habit, he - Farr was asked the question, and

23

have you ever taken any money from some police officers?

24

And he answered no.

25

At the guilt innocence

This was a false statement, but not to be
40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

construed as necessarily as a denial that he was a police

2

informant, particularly given the context of the

3

questioning.

4

Later in the guilt innocence, he was asked -

QUESTION: May I just interrupt with one

5

question?

But isn't it even more significant that his

6

real role in the - in the whole story is that he was the

7

person used by the police as an excuse to go up and get

8

the gun back two weeks after Banks had left it there,

9

whereas the record left the impression that Banks himself

10

wanted that gun to commit future robberies, without any

11

explanation of the fact that the - that two weeks went by

12

without any such request?

13

And then when Farr gets in the picture, they go

14

up to get the gun, and then Farr says, because Banks

15

insisted on it, which is not only false, but improbable

16

and terribly prejudicial at the - at the sentencing

17

hearing.

18

MS. BUNN: Again, though, the - the materiality

19

of Farr's - of this nondisclosure has to be - there are

20

several factors that have to be assessed in that - in that

21

issue.

22

testimony, and the impeachment value of the informant

23

status itself is limited to the mere fact that Farr had

24

acted as a police informant in this case and had assisted

25

police in obtaining the murder weapon.

First, the fact that Farr wasn't paid for his

But that

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

impeachment did not extend to any inference that Farr had

2

testified favorably for the state because he had any

3

financial or any other kind of incentive to do so.

4

QUESTION: What - what -

5

QUESTION: But it - it was diametrically opposed

6

to the notion that he wanted to get the gun to commit

7

robbery, as whereas the real purpose of the whole venture

8

is to get the gun to give to the police.

9

MS. BUNN: But Farr's subjective intent did not

10

undermine Banks' intent, and Banks actually admitted at

11

the punishment phase -

12

QUESTION: Banks' intent as revealed in Farr's

13

testimony, which is the only evidence in supporting that

14

theory that Banks was dangerous for that reason.

15

MS. BUNN: The difference is, Farr's testimony

16

was - indicated that Banks was - had the intent himself to

17

participate in the robberies, and Banks limited that to

18

being willing essentially to - to abet Farr in - in

19

committing those robberies.

20

QUESTION: What - what page of the transcript

21

that you - you cited page 37.

22

appendix?

Is that in the joint

23

MS. BUNN: Yes, joint appendix.

24

QUESTION: And that is the - that is the

25

That's the -

confession of - I'm sorry - that - that is the perjury 42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's the only perjury that's supposedly -

2

MS. BUNN: That's the - that's one instance that

3

they - that - that's the only one dealing with money.

4

What police officers -

5

QUESTION: Of course, this doesn't - this doesn't

6

deal with whether he has - was a police informer.

7

deals with whether the police officers promised you

8

anything.

9

MS. BUNN: Yes, yes, that's correct.

It - it

And that -

10

the denial of that, of course, is - is not fault, because

11

there's nothing in subsequent testimony to indicate that's

12

- that's untrue.

13
14

QUESTION: Have you ever taken any money from
some police officers?

15

No.

MS. BUNN: Yes.

That is a false statement.

16

However, it can - it's - it is far afield to interpret

17

that as a denial of being a police informant.

18
19

QUESTION: Where - where - where is that?

Have

you ever taken any money from police officers?

20

MS. BUNN: That is at joint appendix 37.

21

QUESTION: It's three lines down from the top.

22

MS. BUNN: In the middle of the questioning about

23

- about Farr's prior drug use, defense counsel asks, and -

24

and have you ever taken any money from some police

25

officers?

There is further 43

3

QUESTION: Thirty, thirty-seven, my God, reading
- oh, I got it, I got it, okay.
MS. BUNN: Further, he's asked, what police

4

officers did you talk to about this?

I have talked to no

5

one about this outside of when they called us down

6

referring to the case -

7

QUESTION: Yeah.

8

MS. BUNN: - which again is a false test - is a

false statement, but does not specifically deny police
informant status.
QUESTION: Now, it does seem to me that the
Cooksey report that the - I think it - the Cook - the -

13

MS. BUNN: Cook.

14

QUESTION: - the witness Cook -

15

MS. BUNN: Yes, Charles Cook.

16

QUESTION: - that the - that the report of his

17

interviews with - with the police was - was very, very

18

strong and helpful impeachment material.

19

comment on - on the claim that relates to his testimony?

20

MS. BUNN: Certainly, Your Honor.

Do you want to

The lower

21

courts did not consider that claim to be properly before

22

the court because Banks failed to present it in his

23

Federal petition, failed to present it in any amended and

24

supplemental position, and the - and there's nothing in

25

this - in this record to indicate - that would support a

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

finding of implied consent, or the trial by consent.

2

QUESTION: Well, you said, I mean, the - the

3

Fifth Circuit didn't think that Federal Rule of Civil

4

Procedure 15(b) applies in habeas, right?

5
6

MS. BUNN: That was a basis of its holding, yes.
That's correct, on debatability.

7

QUESTION: Is - is that absolutely clear?

8

MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it's not, and it -

9

QUESTION: Well, if it's not absolutely clear,

10

then - then it seems to me they should have - they should

11

have granted the - the certificate of appealability.

12

MS. BUNN: The issue actually before the Fifth

13

Circuit, the issue that it resolved, was whether - whether

14

it was debatable - the district court - whether the

15

district court abused its discretion in denying the 59(e)

16

motion, because, in fact, the district court never

17

considered 15(b) because it was never raised to the

18

district court, that - that particular argument.

19

So -

QUESTION: Well, that wasn't the basis that the

20

Fifth Circuit relied on.

I thought it relied on the basis

21

that there's huge - there's just no question that 15(b)

22

doesn't apply in habeas.

23

MS. BUNN: That was part -

24

25

that, it seems to me.

holding.

3

That was part of the

The stated QUESTION: So maybe we should remand at - at

4

least on the, you know, on the - on the Cook claim to have

5

the - the Fifth Circuit decide whether a COA - decide the

6

15(b) question and then decide the Cook claim.

7

MS. BUNN: I believe that would be an appropriate

8

course on this issue, and in this - we are not - we are

9

conceding the debatability of the general applicability of

10

15(b) in the habeas context.

11

what we do not believe to be debatable is the

12

applicability in this case, that essentially there's no

13

factual predicate for the application of 15(b) in this

14

case, given that there's - there's simply nothing in the

15

record to show that any party beside Bank himself,

16

including the judge - the lower court judges, had any

17

inkling that this issue was properly before them.

18

QUESTION: But the Fifth Circuit passed on it,

19

didn't it?

20

of whether 15(b) applied?

21

What we do not find to be -

Didn't the Fifth Circuit pass on the question

MS. BUNN: The Fifth Circuit, after - after

22

noting that what the Fifth - that - that the district

23

court's findings regarding the failure to raise the claim,

24

the failure to raise it in an amended petition, did hold

25

that it was - that it - that 15(b) did not apply in the

habeas context.

2

QUESTION: There was one position you took in

3

your brief and you said that - that the state is not

4

obliged to reveal the identity of an informer.

5

correct, is it, if the informer is called as a witness?

6

That's not

MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, that is our position

7

that essentially a prosecutor's duty to disclose whatever

8

information is triggered by the - the potential

9

materiality of that information.

And particularly in a

10

case like this, where the informant is not - was not paid

11

for testimony, was not given any sort of break for his

12

testimony, that there's no specific inference that can be

13

drawn regarding an incentive for testifying favorably for

14

the state, that that is not -

15

QUESTION: What authority - what authority do you

16

have?

17

informant on the stand, it does not have to divulge that

18

capacity?

19

What case holds that when the Government puts an

MS. BUNN: There - I know of no such authority

20

for that particular proposition, but there's also nothing

21

- there's also no opinion from this Court saying that a

22

witness' informant status is per se material, which is

23

essentially what - what that would -

24
25

QUESTION: Isn't there - isn't there a Texas rule
of evidence that says, this is 508(c)(1) of the Texas
47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rules, an informer's identity must be disclosed if he

2

appears as a witness for the public entity?

3

MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, even - even

4

assuming a breach of a Federal rule of - state rule of

5

evidence, that would not implicate the constitutional due

6

process concerns at issue here.

7

And under Brady -

QUESTION: Well - well, it certainly goes to

8

whether or not the defendant is - is entitled to rely on

9

what the prosecution's course of conduct is with reference

10
11

to the informer.
MS. BUNN: But again, there's nothing in this

12

trial record to indicate that trial counsel specifically

13

requested that information prior to going to trial, that

14

he - that trial counsel himself didn't pursue -

15

QUESTION: So you say at the outset of the trial

16

the defense counsel has to say, now, will you comply with

17

all of the rules that are in the Texas statutes?

18

MS. BUNN: Well, there is an obligation from - on

19

- upon defense counsel to pursue the remedies he's

20

entitled to, and to - to specifically request the

21

informant status of any witness, yes, there is an

22

obligation in a case such as this.

23

trial counsel did not do that, at least precludes a -

24
25

And the fact that

QUESTION: Why is there such an obligation if the
state rules require it?

This - we supposed to say we want
48

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to be sure you've complied with all the state rules that

2

govern prosecutions?

3

MS. BUNN: But even assuming that - that

4

violation, that is not - that does not support itself a

5

finding of cause to the procedural default of Banks'

6

failing to develop this claim for years even though

7

knowing of its existence.

8
9

QUESTION: Ms. Bunn, do you have any argument
that this might not have made any difference?

10
11
12
13

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and again, several
factors QUESTION: I - I suggest you might train your
guns on that.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MS. BUNN: Several factors play into that issue.

16

Again, just - just the pure impeachment value itself was -

17

was weakened by the fact that there was no incentive.

18

also the fact that Farr was heavily impeached already and

19

that the informant status, weak as it was, was - was

20

really merely cumulative.

21

out, both on direct and then again on cross, his prior

22

drug abuse, track marks, his denials during cross-

23

examination, refuted by the defense witnesses, which

24

included a denial that he acted as a police informant in -

25

in another case for another jurisdiction.

But

dangerousness.

was willing to drive.

10

And third, even without Farr's

Banks admitted at punishment that he was

In fact, he

QUESTION: But he did - is - is it correct that

11

but for Farr there would have been no testimony that Banks

12

would participate in those robberies, and there would have

13

been no testimony that Banks and his accomplices would use

14

the gun to eliminate any trouble that might come up during

15

that.

Is that correct?

MS. BUNN: Yes.

That is correct.

it?
MS. BUNN: It is a piece of - of - of the state's

puzzle, but it - but given what is left, not material.

21

And again, the fact that he was -

22

QUESTION: It's not material because it would not

have, in effect, raised a serious question about the - the

24

integrity of the result or the fairness of the trial?

2

undermine the verdict.

3

QUESTION: Well, but don't - didn't you have a

4

defendant here without a prior criminal record, and - and

5

the state is trying to prove future dangerousness and that

6

this is a really bad actor.

7

went rather to the heart of the sentencing question.

I would have thought that

8

MS. BUNN: It was definitely favorable evidence

9

to the state's future dangerousness case, but it was not

10

all that was there.

11

QUESTION: Well, you have there as well Mr.

12

Jefferson, who said that Banks whacked him or hit him hard

13

and happened to omit that he himself, Mr. Jefferson, had

14

attacked Mr. Banks' sister, which could be a reason why he

15

had hit him.

16

MS. BUNN: Well, the - Vetrano Jefferson's

17

testimony, though he did amend his version of the incident

18

in post-conviction proceedings, he did not recant his

19

testimony that Banks hit him across the face with a gun,

20

but only that - and not that he had attacked Banks' wife,

21

but that he had - that he had had a verbal altercation

22

with her.

23

whatsoever that Banks responded to by hitting him across

24

the face with a gun, and this happened a week prior to the

25

murder.

And there was no physical - no physical threat

And again, this testimony indicated that Banks

2

was known to carry a weapon on a regular basis in the

3

weeks before the murder.

4

unprovoked nature of it, the fact that Banks essentially

5

lured a 16-year-old kid to a - an abandoned and secluded

6

park near his home and shot him three times to steal his

7

car.

9

And the murder itself, the

And then - and then the fact that though though Farr's testimony was - was crucial on the limited

10

issue of Banks' willingness to participate himself in the

11

armed robberies, it still - still the fact that Banks had

12

it - and himself admitted - admitted at punishment that he

13

was willing to abet Farr's commission of murder and had,

14

in fact, been willing to drive what would have been a six-

15

hour round trip to Dallas in the middle of the night to

16

procure that weapon to - to aid those -

17

QUESTION: He didn't admit that - that he was

18

willing to abet murder.

He just admitted he was willing

19

to get the gun for robberies.

20

MS. BUNN: Yes.

21

QUESTION: Did he say specifically, in order that

22
23

somebody can be killed?

He didn't say -

MS. BUNN: He did - he did testify in - in

24

response to cross-examination by the prosecutor that he

25

was willing to provide what could potentially be a death

weapon in a robbery case.

2

dangerousness evidence that remains, as well as the

3

incremental impeachment value of Farr's informant status

4

within the context of the trial, former's informant -

5

Farr's informant status wouldn't have put the state's case

6

in such a different light as to undermine confidence in -

7

in the jury's verdict.

8

And in the light of this future

Again, the state's duty to - to disclose in

9

these cases is triggered by the materiality of the

10

evidence, and in this case, Farr's import - Farr's

11

informant status was not that kind of - of evidence.

12

was not material evidence.

Unless there are no further questions.

Thank

you.

15

QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bunn.

16

Mr. Kendall, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL

It

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KENDALL: Thank you, Your Honor.

Very

20

briefly, on the Charles Cook claim, I - Ms. Bunn has

21

conceded that jurors of reason would find debatable the

22

rule 15 issue.

23

that, that we not go back just to the Fifth Circuit, that

24

the case be sent back to the court in Texarkana, the

25

district court, for fact-finding on the underlying claim.

We would ask that if the Court agrees with

There's not been any fact-finding whatsoever on that

2

claim, and we think that would be, if the case is going

3

back to the Fifth Circuit, that that would be entirely

4

useful.

Thank you very much.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kendall.
