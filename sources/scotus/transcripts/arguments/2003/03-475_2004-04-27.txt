General

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

This is a case about the separation of

12

powers.

13

President's discretion the authority to obtain the

14

opinions of subordinates and to formulate

15

recommendations for legislation.

16

neither intrude on the President's ability to perform

17

these functions, nor authorize private litigants to

18

use the courts to do so.

19

The Constitution explicitly commits to the

Congress may

As this Court has construed the Federal

20

Advisory Committee Act to avoid what the Court

21

regarded and described as formidable constitutional

22

questions, FACA does not permit the litigation and

23

discovery the Respondents wish to pursue.

24
25

QUESTION:

Would you say it's also a

separation of powers question, Mr. Olson, to the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

extent that it involves the ability of the courts to

2

formulate rules to prevent them from deciding

3

questions unnecessarily?

4
5
6

GENERAL OLSON:

I'm not sure I understand

the thrust of your question.
QUESTION:

Well, you said this is a case

7

about separation of powers.

And I wanted -- I asked

8

whether or not the authority of the courts is not

9

also involved here, because there is a concern that

10

we should have rules designed to prevent us from

11

unnecessarily deciding questions.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, with respect to

13

the -- I'm not sure whether you are asking a question

14

about the jurisdiction of the Court, because that's

15

an issue that's before the Court, or with respect to

16

construing the Federal Advisory Committee Act to

17

avoid the constitutional questions that are implicit

18

in that statute.

19

We think that there is jurisdiction in

20

this Court.

21

Public Citizen was make it very clear that because of

22

the formidable constitutional questions, in fact, the

23

Court referred to the constitutional questions in

24

that case as undeniable.

25

We think that what the Court did in

The Court construed the Federal Advisory

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Committee Act not to apply in that case.

2

same rationale is applied here, the Court will not

3

get to the constitutional question which FACA would

4

inevitably raise if it intruded upon the President's

5

power to obtain opinions from his subordinates, and

6

to make recommendations to Congress with respect to

7

legislation.

8
9

QUESTION:

If that

General Olson, we would also

not get to it if we adhered to the firm final

10

judgment rule which is the first hurdle that you have

11

to overcome.

12

is no jurisdiction for us to review at this point.

13

You wouldn't get to the merits if there

GENERAL OLSON:

That's true, Justice

14

Ginsburg.

15

what the Court decided unanimously in the United

16

States vs. Nixon for two reasons.

17

place, a denial of immediate review would render

18

impossible any review whatsoever of the claims, the

19

separation of powers claims that are being made here,

20

because the Vice President -- and the Vice President

21

is acting as the subordinate and surrogate for the

22

President here.

23

This case fits squarely, we submit, within

In the first

This is the President's authority.

QUESTION:

Well, of course, in the Nixon

24

case, the President exercised his privilege and it

25

was overruled.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL OLSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

fours in that sense.

4

Yes, Justice Kennedy

So it's not, it's not on all

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it's not all fours

5

in that sense, but the principle as articulated by

6

the Court on pages 683 -- I mean 691 to 692.

7

the Court was concerned about there is that the

8

traditional contempt avenue or any aspect of what

9

would be required of the President of the United

What

10

States to defy a court order would be both unseemly

11

and would unnecessarily provoke a constitutional

12

confrontation.

13

What the Court said in that case, when we

14

are talking about, when the Court is talking about

15

important separation of powers questions, the

16

President is in the position of having to defy a

17

court order, risk sanctions of some sort.

18

QUESTION:

But you are not defying a court

19

order if you exercise a privilege.

20

a privilege.

21

GENERAL OLSON:

Or if you assert

With respect, Justice

22

Kennedy, this case, the separation of powers issue in

23

this case goes far beyond the assertion of executive

24

privilege.

25

particular documents or a concern over the

Executive privilege concerns itself with

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

relationship that particular documents refer to.

2

objection here is to the process.

3

The

The President and the Vice President are

4

being subjected to litigation and discovery which

5

goes far beyond what the statute would require here.

6

QUESTION:

It's essential to the

7

Government's position, I take it, that this Court

8

reject the de facto doctrine that was developed by

9

the Court of Appeals.

10

GENERAL OLSON:

We think, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, that the de facto doctrine is wrong.

12

inconsistent with Public Citizen, and if the Court

13

were to construe -- find that somehow that the

14

statute could be construed to create a de facto

15

doctrine, which no court has ever done, finally done

16

in connection with a case, that the case, the statute

17

would be unconstitutional as it applied to these

18

circumstances.

19

It's

However, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe

20

that the Court does not need to get there by

21

construing the statute narrowly, as the Court did in

22

Public Citizen, unanimously, I might say, because

23

three of the eight justices felt that the statute, if

24

it were construed any other way, would be

25

unconstitutional.

Construing the statute in that

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

fashion -­

2

QUESTION:

When you say construe it

3

narrowly, but nonetheless, retain the de facto

4

doctrine?

5

GENERAL OLSON:

No.

Not deal with it at

6

all.

I mean, the statute itself, we submit,

7

addresses -- I think in the context of this case,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, the statute may be construed in

9

the context of a Presidential advisory group

10

explicitly excluding a committee that's formed of all

11

government employees, and as construed by the Court

12

in that case, either -- the words used in the statute

13

are established or utilized.

14

case, this commission was established by the

15

President.

16

application of FACA.

17

QUESTION:

As construed by that

It would be exempt on its face from

But what if it's, what if

18

it's -- what if the manner in which it's utilized is

19

that, in fact, outsiders, nongovernment employees,

20

were actually given a vote, that when the committee

21

took a vote, there were some nongovernment employees

22

who were counted?

23

GENERAL OLSON:

We submit, Justice Scalia,

24

that that would raise very serious constitutional

25

questions.

As an antecedent to that, there was no

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

intention when Congress passed a statute to prohibit

2

or regulate ex parte communications between the

3

executive branch and members of the public.

4

QUESTION:

Well, this is, this is more

5

than ex parte communications.

It's that the

6

committee is in fact, as utilized, not a committee

7

composed exclusively of government employees.

8

I'm saying is the people voting, the people voting,

9

why would that be such an intrusion upon the

All

10

executive?

11

anybody that voted on the various recommendations of

12

the commission was a nongovernment employee.

13

would that be such a terrible -­

14

Simply to require knowledge of whether

GENERAL OLSON:

Why

Well, I'm going to, I'm

15

going to quote from the Public Citizen decision

16

itself, which authoritatively and specifically

17

defined the term or utilized in a way which would be

18

flatly inconsistent with this question that you just

19

raised.

20

But I also want to mention, and would want

21

to go on to say, that would require that the courts

22

ignore the presumption of regularity which applies to

23

the executive, particularly when the executive is

24

performing core executive branch functions, which it

25

clearly is in this case.

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

But to get back to your question, the

2

court in Public Citizen, on page 462, specifically

3

defined what or utilized meant in that case.

4

defined it in this way, in order to avoid the

5

undeniable formidable constitutional questions that

6

would be raised if it was defined as you suggested.

7

The Court said -­

8
9

QUESTION:

And

General Olson, would you

clarify why we are dealing with the merits.

I

10

thought, and correct me if I misunderstand this, that

11

the merits will have to be resolved in the first

12

instance by the court below.

13

is jurisdiction, if we agree with you, for example,

14

that this discovery should not have been allowed,

15

then why should we take the first view of the merits

16

of this case?

17

GENERAL OLSON:

If we find that there

It seems to me in the

18

context of this case, Justice Ginsburg, that once

19

jurisdiction is acknowledged, the context of the

20

case, the administrative record, which specifically

21

contains within it the Presidential directive which

22

created the advisory committee only to include

23

members of the executive branch.

24

committee, which specifically identifies as members

25

only members of the executive branch, and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

affidavit or declaration that's on file from the

2

deputy director, which said that the only

3

participants were members of the executive branch,

4

and the presumption of reliability, of regularity

5

that the Court consistently, U.S. vs. Armstrong is

6

one case, the Court consistently, absent clear

7

evidence to the contrary, accords executive branch

8

action -­

9

QUESTION:

But you would still be asking

10

us to resolve the merits in the first instance, not

11

to review any lower court decision because they said

12

there ought to be discovery first.

13

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, but we are

14

submitting that the discovery itself violates the

15

Constitution, violates FACA as properly construed.

16
17

QUESTION:

All discovery, not -- you are

not -­

18

GENERAL OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, because -­

But isn't that simply the basic

20

argument on the merits again.

21

you're saying the reason we can't have discovery is

22

because the whole statute is unconstitutional as

23

applied to the President.

24

GENERAL OLSON:

25

The reason -- I think

Unconstitutional if it --

if applied in these circumstances.

Now, it may be

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

construed -­

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

If we go -- I mean, if we

3

do what Justice Ginsburg is trying to do, and that is

4

get to the jurisdictional issue without passing, in

5

the first instance, as accord in the first instance

6

on the merits, then it seems to me that the

7

jurisdictional question, boils down to me at least

8

to this.

9

jurisdiction when jurisdiction goes to the propriety

Why should we accept your position on

10

with constitutional overtones, of course, of

11

discovery, and we don't have the discovery order

12

refined yet.

13

If this case goes back or if it had indeed

14

not been appealed in the first place, you would have

15

been fighting with your colleagues on the other side

16

about what specific discovery to allow.

17

what the District Court specifically was going to

18

allow, we would have a fairly sharply focused

19

question, and that arguably would be subject to an

20

appeal regardless of the final judgment rule.

21

don't have that focus yet.

22

GENERAL OLSON:

Once we knew

But we

Well, there is two answers

23

to that -- at least two, Justice Souter.

In the

24

first place, the discovery was ordered by the

25

District Court.

It may be found at pages 215 to 220.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But you never came down -- I

2

realize that, I have read the orders.

3

came back, or the Government never came back and

4

said, well, that order is too broad because, and we

5

think it could be allowed to this extent, and there

6

was -- there was no, as I understand it, there was no

7

process of trying to refine the discovery order down

8

to anything beyond the generalities that we have on

9

the record.

10

GENERAL OLSON:

But you never

Every effort was made with

11

respect to the actions of the litigants in the

12

District Court to refine it as much as possible.

The

13

District Court finally said this is what I order.

I

14

order the Petitioners not to file any dispositive

15

motions.

16

discovery, to reply to nonprivileged discovery

17

requests and assert executive privilege, which we are

18

saying -­

I order the Petitioners to respond to the

19

QUESTION:

20

executive privilege.

21
22
23

And you did not assert any

GENERAL OLSON:

No.

We did not.

We did

not.
QUESTION:

So we don't know what might be

24

subject to executive privilege, and sustained,

25

perhaps, and what would not be.

And it's the what

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

would not be that would raise the constitutional

2

issue that you are trying to raise.

3

me, until we know exactly what that is, there is a

4

pretty good argument that the final judgment rule

5

should not be subject to exception at this point.

6

GENERAL OLSON:

And it seems to

Well, I think that there

7

is a very strong case that it should be, Justice

8

Souter.

9

too, and said, well, the District Court might have

The Court of Appeals addressed this issue,

10

been too broad.

11

Court of Appeals recognized the constitutional

12

implications and then said, but maybe that can be

13

narrowed down, but that the Respondents should be

14

entitled to whatever discovery they need to prove

15

their case.

16
17
18
19
20

In fact, the Circuit Court, the

QUESTION:

Was the District, was the

District Court's discovery order unconditional?
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it was -- I don't

know what you mean by -­
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, did it say, you

21

know, the Government must produce thus and so, thus

22

and so, thus and so?

23

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, it did, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, although it did say that the Government

25

could assert privileges with respect to burden or

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

executive privilege, and so forth.

2

at those discovery orders and they are in the joint

3

appendix, they were much broader than the statute

4

itself, broader than the relief that possibly could

6

QUESTION:

But if one looks

But now we are dealing with the

7

situation at the two, the two justices, judges on the

8

Court of Appeals both said, this is too, this

9

discovery order was too broad.

It ought to be

10

trimmed.

11

message, so you could have gone back there and said

12

see, District judge, this has to be narrowed.

13

Now the District judge would have that

GENERAL OLSON:

Inevitably what would have

14

happened, because what the Court of Appeals said, and

15

this is at Petition appendix 18-A of the Court of

16

Appeals decision is that however refined the District

17

Court's order would be, they would be, the

18

Respondents would be entitled to whatever discovery

19

they needed to prove their case.

20

Now, what they need to prove their case,

21

notwithstanding the presumption of regularity that

22

the Court has always applied to the executive, absent

23

clear evidence to the contrary, there is no clear

24

evidence to the contrary here, Justice Ginsburg.

25

there is is a pure unadorned allegation which the

All

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Respondents say they get from media reports that

2

there were contacts, nothing beyond that.

3

But what they would need to prove, to

4

prove their case is precisely what the District Court

5

was going to allow them to utilize.

Why is it that you went to -- that you are

justified in going to the Court of Appeals?

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

Because

something new under Cox or is it on one of the before

GENERAL OLSON:

This fits squarely within

Nixon.

19

and remember, we are talking about the President as

the real party in interest, to place himself in the

posture of disobeying a court order, merely to

9

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it certainly does

when it involves the President or the Vice President

on that.

QUESTION:

Justice Breyer -­

Why not do that?
We believe that it's much

I know that's your legal

7

argument, and you may be right about that.

But

8

assuming you are right about that, you bring up the

9

broader issue on an appeal from the case.

See if you

10

lose it.

11

guess isn't enough to get you to appeal a discovery

12

order if -- but maybe you can if you really need to.

13

And as to your being right, being right I

So my question is, why did you really need

14

to since you could have asserted executive privilege

15

as to each individual.

16

GENERAL OLSON:

Because the act of forcing

17

the President to invoke executive privilege every

18

time someone files a lawsuit, notwithstanding the

19

presumption of regularity which was completely

20

ignored here, that means that FACA would be used in

21

every case to file a lawsuit to challenge the

President and the Vice President's ability to -­

Let me ask you this.

At some

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

point, I think the Government made a Section 12(b)(6)

2

motion to dismiss this suit because the statute was

3

unconstitutional.

And that was denied.

4

Now, could the Government not have sought

5

review either under the collateral order doctrine at

6

that time, or even by mandamus to address directly

7

whether the statute is constitutional?

8
9

GENERAL OLSON:
O'Connor.

10
11
12

Potentially, Justice

QUESTION:

Why didn't the Government do

that?
GENERAL OLSON:

Because the Government was

13

anxious -- because there was another way to resolve

14

this whole problem, notwithstanding the denial of the

15

12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.

16

QUESTION:

But wouldn't that have given

17

the courts a chance to go directly to the issue of

18

whether the statute is constitutional?

19

GENERAL OLSON:

We submit that what the

20

Government did here was try to work out the delicate

21

constitutional problems that were involved here, the

22

balancing of the executive's prerogative with the

23

litigation function and that sort of thing, and to go

24

the extra mile.

25

to encourage filing a mandamus or collateral order

I don't think the Court would want

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

appeals every time there is a denial of a motion to

2

dismiss.

3

QUESTION:

I take it, General Olson, that

4

from the rest of your argument that traditional

5

executive privilege doctrine would not cover all of

6

the constitutional issues that you think exist here?

7

GENERAL OLSON:

That's precisely correct,

8

Mr. Chief Justice.

The forcing of the President to

9

submit to litigation and discovery, which if

10

permitted in this case could be in any case

11

comparable to it, any time advice is being sought

12

from a citizen or from subordinates who may have then

13

talked to citizens, notwithstanding the clear four

14

corners of the directive when the President created

15

the body within his own Administration from which he

16

sought advice, every time there would be a lawsuit,

17

every time they would say, well, Mr. President, come

18

into court and claim executive privilege.

19

QUESTION:

I see that.

I see that.

But

20

that's an argument which you made in response to my

21

question which is an argument on the merits.

22

want you to focus on the fact that -- assume I agree

23

with you on the merits.

24

make that argument on the merits, even if you lose

25

here and if you lose the case.

And I

You will have a chance to

1

Now, my question is addressed to the need

2

for an interim appeal from the discovery.

3

that, what is your response to the fact that you

4

could get your interim appeal or at least preserve

5

yourself from harm if you had asserted executive

6

privilege to the individual bits of the discovery

7

order with which you disagreed.

8

GENERAL OLSON:

And as to

There is two answers to

that, one of which the Chief Justice suggested in his

10

question.

12

President and the Vice President to spend time with

13

documents deciding whether or not to assert executive

14

privilege.

15

Executive privilege may not have covered
It would have required the

And it is the process -- more importantly

16

than that, it is the process itself of submitting, as

17

it would be if someone, if the Congress had applied

18

this statute to the Supreme Court of the United

19

States or even to itself, and then allowed litigants

20

to bring the Court or members of Congress into court

21

to explain why they wouldn't produce information with

22

respect to who they talked to.

23

QUESTION:

Well, but Mr. Olson you know better than

24

most the dynamics -- than most attorneys, the dynamics of

25

the discovery system.

I hear in your argument echoes

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

of every discovery dispute I've ever listened to.

2

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes.

There are several

3

differences, Justice Kennedy.

As I said at the very

4

beginning, this discovery dispute involves bringing

5

the President and the Vice President of the United

6

States into court to defend themselves with respect

7

to textually committed obligations and

8

responsibilities that they have under the

9

Constitution.

10

Every other discovery dispute that I have

11

experienced, and I submit this Court has experienced

12

except for perhaps U.S. vs. Nixon, maybe another

13

case, did not involve those circumstances.

14

at -- this puts the President, in order to challenge

15

the constitutionality of a process that's invasive to

16

fundamental Presidential prerogatives and

17

responsibilities into court to defend himself,

18

notwithstanding the questionable constitutionality of

19

the statute that triggers it, that mandamus may not

20

be brought against the Vice President which is the --

21

the Federal Advisory Committee Act, it's worth

22

mentioning, does not create a private right of

23

action.

24

against the Vice President here.

25

This is

The APA did not create a right of action

So the litigants in this case, not having

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

a right to even bring this case under the statute,

2

then sought mandamus, it's important to mention.

3

QUESTION:

Well, then why did the

4

Government turn over 36,000 pages of paper from the

5

agencies that were also a part of this action if the

6

whole thing is so misguided, if the application of

7

this Act violates the separation of powers, why did

8

the Government respond to the request for information

9

from the agencies?

10

GENERAL OLSON:

There are several answers

11

to that.

13

14

therefore, the obligations were different with

15

respect to the President's core function.

And

Arguments

But those documents that were

18

turned over were, as I recall, documents that would

19

have been available under FOIA, is that right?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, Mr. -- Justice

21

Scalia, they would have been arguably available under

22

FOIA, and they were produced under FOIA.

23

QUESTION:

But you didn't get, you didn't

24

make the argument that no discovery, you are very

25

clear about that, no discovery is appropriate under

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

this statute.

And yet you didn't, whether -- whether

2

the information that was turned over could have been

3

gotten under FOIA, this wasn't a FOIA suit.

4

GENERAL OLSON:

There was more than one

5

action, Justice Ginsburg.

There were several FOIA

6

actions brought against the various different

7

departments.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, specifically, these pages

that had been previously disclosed to other

10

requesters under FOIA.

11

wasn't it made to them under the FACA?

12

The request in this case,

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes.

But the documents

13

having already been produced and made available to

14

the public under FOIA, it seemed to the government

15

that would be foolhardy and unnecessarily

16

confrontational and would serve no purpose whatsoever

17

to withhold producing another set of those documents.

18

Again, this is effort -­

19

QUESTION:

General Olson, would you

clarify one thing for me?

21

produced by agencies or were they produced by the

22

energy policy group.

25

Were these documents

GENERAL OLSON:

They were produced by

So there has been no discovery

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

at all from the policy group, and you claim, of

2

3

language of the statute.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIERRA CLUB

10
11

MR. MORRISON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

The threshold question before this Court

13

is whether the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that

14

it lacked jurisdiction over Petitioners' attempt to

15

obtain interlocutory review of the District Court's

16

order.

17

In seeking review in this Court,

18

Petitioners paint the picture of having been backed

19

into a corner.

20

immediate appellate review that they will lose all

21

meaningful opportunity to obtain review of the legal

22

positions that they have taken in the District Court.

23

The basis for this claim, as the Solicitor

They claim that if they do not obtain

24

General said, is United States against Nixon.

The

25

Court of Appeals correctly distinguished that case,

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

and said that under neither mandamus or the

2

collateral order was review proper.

The Petitioners -­

4

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals based

5

that, as I recall, on the fact that in Nixon,

6

executive privilege had been asserted, right?

7

MR. MORRISON:

They certainly made that

8

observation, but that was not the only reason relied

9

upon by the Court of Appeals.

There is some question

10

as to the extent to which the Court of Appeals

11

opinion can be read in that regard.

12

on the fact that executive privilege was not claimed

13

because here the Government's position is that no

14

discovery of any kind whatsoever, other than the

15

previously produced documents, is available here.

16

QUESTION:

We do not rely

I'm surprised to hear that.

17

was, I was going to talk to you about executive

18

privilege, because I thought that your briefs did

19

rely on the fact that executive privilege was not

20

claimed, and that doesn't seem to me a very

21

significant factor.

22

MR. MORRISON:

I

I thought I had been pretty

23

clear in my brief saying that executive privilege was

24

certainly something that could be claimed down the

25

road.

And we certainly -- the District judge had not

precluded that from happening.

It makes no difference.

It

But there is an interim

position in which one would say, well, it makes a

difference to this extent, that until the executive

privilege has been claimed and has been ruled upon,

11

the extent of -- to which they have a plausible

12

separation of powers argument is not clear.

13
14

I mean, we could take that position, I
take it, you would agree?

15

MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

That would require

16

accepting the notion that -- that everything else

17

that they can -- they can refuse to turn over

18

everything else, which is essentially their position

19

here.

20

no discovery, period, in this case.

21

The Solicitor General's brief is very clear,

QUESTION:

It would also require

22

acceptance of the position that executive privilege

23

is a definable doctrine only applicable to certain

24

matters, and that it is, it is the function of this

court to decide what it can be asserted for and what

1

it can't be asserted for.

the President feels that he is threatened, he can

He is, he has the power as an independent

11

branch to say, no, this intrudes too much upon my

13

it's a struggle between two branches.

14

view executive privilege that way, forcing him to

15

assert executive privilege is really pushing things

16

to an extreme that should not very often occur in

17

this Republic.

MR. MORRISON:

And after that, it's a,
And if you

Well, leaving aside the

19

question of the interpretation of the United States

against Nixon as to whether that decision agrees with

21

Your Honor's interpretation, we don't have to get to

22

that issue in this case, and -- and the -­

23

QUESTION:

I don't want to delay this.

24

But to me this is important.

Assume that their

25

interpretation of the statute is completely right.

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Assume that.

2

MR. MORRISON:

3

Yes.

I know you don't want to, but

4

for argument's sake, then what they are really asking

5

for is a separate exception from the collateral

6

order.

7

them, the Vice President and the President, and

8

nobody else, to take an appeal from discovery.

I mean, and a separate exception that allows

9

Now, executive privilege in my mind came

10

in by asking, well, shouldn't they at least have to

11

assert that it's that kind of imposition upon the

12

President's office prior to being able to carve out,

13

under whatever name, a separate exception that would

14

permit an appeal.

15

MR. MORRISON:

I don't read the

16

Government's brief as being that narrow.

17

extent that what they are saying is that they have

18

some kind of special immunity from discovery, it

19

would, as Justice O'Connor suggested earlier, have

20

been perfectly apparent the day of July 11th when the

21

court denied the motion to dismiss, and ordered that

You can't appeal from, you

can't appeal from the denial of the motion to

That's really interlocutory.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, Your Honor, but --

6

the notion that there is a special kind of immunity

7

from discovery of the President and Vice President, a

8

situation like this which is what I understand their

9

argument to be, that's the functional equivalent of

an immunity defense for which there is an exception

when they should have taken the appeal.

I wonder about that.

I can see

as being right, but not in light of what the District

I have -- I have always been

12

puzzled by that in your briefs, to participate in the

13

same manner as other committee members.

14

me the essence of being a committee member is having

15

a vote in the outcome.

16

discovery you would need is discovery as to whether

17

anybody who was not a government employee voted.

18

MR. MORRISON:

It seems to

So it seems to me the only

That, Your Honor, I suggest

19

is a question of law as to whether voting is

20

required, but we believe that if outsiders

21

participated in the marking up of drafts, they had

22

input into the drafts, particularly at the subgroup

23

level, even though they had no formal vote -­

QUESTION:

Why is that?

If I bring

somebody else from my agency with me, I expect all of

They certainly had assistants with them.

no.

It is certainly a plausible

interpretation, Your Honor.

Not plausible to me.

to have a very narrow exception.

QUESTION:

Isn't the posture of this case

Your Honor, we would get

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ORFANEDES

12

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT JUDICIAL WATCH, INC.

13
14
15

MR. ORFANEDES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Judicial Watch submits there was no

16

jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals to review the

17

District Court's discovery orders, but assuming for

18

purposes of argument that there was jurisdiction, we

19

respectfully submit that the District Court properly

20

denied Petitioners' motion to dismiss, both as a

21

matter of statutory construction and consistent with

22

Circuit precedent and separation of powers.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that surely is one thing

24

that's not before us, is it, is the District Court's

25

denial of the motion to dismiss?

MR. ORFANEDES:

QUESTION:

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, no -­

I mean, it's not appealable.
That's correct.

The

4

Government is arguing, however, that the discovery

5

that the District Court did order should not have

been ordered because of the underlying merits of the

7

motion to dismiss is my understanding of the

Government's argument.

QUESTION:

We both read their

indistinguishable from arguing -­

The statute isn't one under which you can

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well then go ahead and

make the argument.

20

MR. ORFANEDES:

If you could allow me to

21

proceed.

The District Court ordered discovery

22

because it believed that it was necessary in order to

23

avoid the constitutional issues that the Government

24

is raising in their briefs.

25

the District Court properly applied what was Circuit

In denying the motion,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

precedent at the time and is Circuit precedent, the

2

AAPS case, allowing for this de facto membership

3

doctrine that we have talked about.

4

The District Court thought that if

5

discovery yielded information that would show there

6

were no, there was no involvement of private

7

individuals in the task force, then there would be no

8

reason, no reason to even reach the constitutional

9

issues.

10

QUESTION:

Involvement of private

11

individuals in the task force does not equate with

12

membership of private individuals in the task force,

13

and I wonder what your view is about the question

14

that I asked to Mr. Morrison.

What, what is it that

15

makes you a de facto member?

It surely can't be just

16

sitting there next to somebody else who is even at a

17

full committee meeting.

18

the cabinet member.

19

It can't be sitting next to

MR. ORFANEDES:

I think the court in the

20

AAPS case, that the District Court was relying on,

21

and that the Circuit Court was also -­

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, that case may be

23

wrong.

What is it that makes you de facto member?

24

What -- I assume it's the same thing that makes you a

25

member, that is the power to determine the action the

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

committee will take.

2

That is the power to vote.

MR. ORFANEDES:

I think it's not looking

3

just at voting, but whether or not there is anything

4

that functionally distinguishes the members, the de

5

facto members from the actual members.

6

QUESTION:

There is.

The vote.

Let's

7

assume that's the only thing that distinguishes them,

8

the vote.

9

Isn't that enough?
MR. ORFANEDES:

It could be a vote.

But

10

there could also be -- it could also be more than

11

that, in this particular instance -­

12

QUESTION:

If it's more than that, you are

not talking about de facto members.

14

about de facto participants, and that's a different

MR. MORRISON:

recommendations did end up mirroring recommendations

is the following.

those outside people could be hit with a discovery

what did you do.

And their final point is that Congress

could not possibly have intended in this statute to

have created that circumstance, putting government in

a cocoon when it develops legislative policy.

QUESTION:

MR. ORFANEDES:

The case law that has

interpreted the statute and the statute themselves

requires a certain degree of formality, structure and

8

continuity to an advisory committee before, before

the requirements of the statute begin to apply.

Baroody case, that I think all the parties have cited

in their brief held exactly that.

QUESTION:

That there has to

Explain the degree of formality

16

that you think triggers the statute.

17

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, certainly there has

to be an establishing document, according to FACA.

think there has to be some degree of understanding of

what the membership of the committee is going to be.

7

You get together with your

Now, do we have the

That, that may trigger the

8

questions that we made.

And I think there is one

9

thing that's important about this particular

10

committee, and the document that established it.

11

It's a January 29th memorandum from the President.

12

It's in the appendix at 157, I believe.

13

And in that document, the Vice President

14

was given the discretion to create subordinate

15

working groups.

16

that limits subordinate working groups to consisting

17

only of private employees.

18

There is nothing in that document

If the interagency task force

creates the FACA situation in your view, imagine that

20

I have repeated my first question, but simply applied

it to interagency task forces.

response?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ORFANEDES:

I think again what becomes

2

important is the membership of that task force.

3

if that, if the idea behind creating that task force

4

allowed for, in the AAPS case, outside consultants or

5

consultants of undetermined origin, in this instance

6

subgroups, without any limitation as to whether or

7

not they would be Federal employees or not Federal

8

employees, in that instance, the requirements of the

9

statute could be triggered.

10

QUESTION:

And

Those subgroups would report to

11

the full committee, I assume, they would not have any

12

dispositive authority over what the report of the

13

committee says, would they?

14

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, there was nothing in

15

the originating document that described who those

16

subgroups would report to.

17

QUESTION:

Well, they are called

subgroups, aren't they?

of a committee.

QUESTION:

Well, if the, if the statute

8

requires disclosure of all these things, at the end

9

of the day, as a final order, and discovery, when

10

they are hit with a discovery order, it gives them

11

all the same information, why isn't the Government

12

right, that this really is the essence of the suit

13

and we should hear the merits of it now.

MR. ORFANEDES:

I don't think it is the

essence of the suit.

MR. MORRISON:

I'm not saying they consented to

of all, whether the statute applies.

not.

right to relief and jurisdictional defect, something

the same as giving you a victory in the lawsuit.

Actually, they have -­

It's only the group itself that

MR. ORFANEDES:

And if I understand

The agency defendants have

if any, independent individuals, private individuals

QUESTION:

Could you just embellish your

answer to Justice Stevens' question a little bit?

And that is, if you, if you get some discovery, and

6

you win your case, what do you get when you win that

7

you will not already have gotten by the discovery?

10

MR. ORFANEDES:

I guess I just want to --

is this as a comparison to the discovery that, that
was ordered?

11

QUESTION:

Whatever the discovery is.

12

Whatever the discovery is.

13

to win your case, you win it.

14

besides a statement saying they were wrong, you win.

15

MR. ORFANEDES:

You got enough discovery
What do you get then

If discovery is limited to

16

the narrowing that the appellate court suggested,

17

none of that information, I believe, would be

18

something that we would get under the statute if we

19

were to win.

basically the documents of the committee as limited

21

by any properly applied exemptions of FOIA.

22

Under the statute, we are entitled to

MR. ORFANEDES:

QUESTION:

What are these documents that

you would get that you would not already have gotten

at the discovery stage?

4

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, the documents the

5

appellate court was talking about, and in addition to

6

interrogatories which we don't get -- and actually,

7

at one point the Government actually suggested that

discovery take place on the basis of interrogatories.

9

We wouldn't get any interrogatory answers.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ORFANEDES:

12

QUESTION:

13

So you would get documents?
We would get documents.

And what documents would you

get?

14

MR. ORFANEDES:

We would get, I believe

15

the statute allows disclosure of all of the documents

16

of the task force subject to the limitations of FOIA.

17

The documents are produced as if the task force was

18

an agency subject to FOIA, and all the exemptions

19

that FOIA applies, I believe, apply to these

20

documents.

21

So you'd get a broad disclosure

foremost on the statement in the memorandum creating

Then we also attach several statements,

acknowledgments by the Government, that describe

meetings between task force representatives and

representatives of Enron and representatives of other

working groups.

16

acknowledged there were at least five such meetings.

17

We know that the Vice President met with the chairman

of Enron, Ken Lay.

kinds of folks, we met with energy groups, we met

with environmental groups -­

QUESTION:

They talked to a lot of people,

got a lot of advice, but does that make them de facto

members of the committee?

5

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, that's the question

6

that we are seeking to answer through our discovery.

7

The point is that this is not an unsupported, these

8

are not mere unsupported allegations.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure that's

10

right.

11

people doesn't really prove anything, it doesn't seem

12

to me.

13

Just because you said they talked to a lot of

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, if you put that

14

together, the allegations of the individuals that

15

were met with, with the statement in the memorandum

16

that allows the Vice President discretion to create

17

working groups, we think it does at least raise a

18

significant question as to whether outside

19

individuals were participating in these working

20

groups and participating in the committee as a whole.

21

In any event, the District Court firmly

22

believes that it needed this discovery in order to

23

answer these questions.

QUESTION:

I see my time is up.

Yes.

Thank you, Mr. Orfanedes.

General Olson, you have five minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

3

QUESTION:

General Olson, I hope you'll

address the point whether you'll, whether you'll have

5

to disclose anything more at the end of the suit than

6

you will under the discovery.

7

difference between what they get under the discovery

8

order and what they would get if they win the suit?

9

GENERAL OLSON:

Is there a big

Thank you, Justice Scalia.

10

I was going to address that point because it's been

11

addressed by Justice Souter, Justice Stevens, Justice

12

Kennedy.

13

to read the interrogatories or the requests for

14

admissions, but those require the production of all

15

information with respect to any contacts at all

16

between any member of the task force or any

17

government employee that assisted with it or any

18

agency -­

19
20
21

What the discovery -- and I don't have time

QUESTION:

Those were all within the scope of

the order that the District Court gave?
GENERAL OLSON:

Yes.

Those were the

22

discovery and requests for admissions.

Now, the

23

Court of Appeals didn't refine that.

24

well, that's pretty broad, and it should be narrowed

25

down, but it should be whatever is necessary to prove

It said that,

1

their case.

2

They thought what was necessary to prove

3

their case was to have all outside contacts.

4

does not require the production of that degree or

5

that scope of documents.

6

and drafts and things that were actually considered

7

by the committee.

8

than the relief that would be available if FACA

9

existed.

10

FACA

It has to do with minutes

So the discovery is vastly broader

Secondly -­
QUESTION:

General Olson, I thought that

11

the, what the Court of Appeals said is there could be

12

discovery on two issues.

13

non-Federal offices participated, and two, to what

14

extent.

15

pretty clear on that, that that would be the nature

16

of the discovery permissible.

17

And one was what

Judge Tattle and Judge Edwards were both

MR. ORFANEDES:

Well, of course.

But

18

that's exactly what those requests for admissions in

19

those interrogatories seek.

20

member of the committee or any other government

21

employee and any outside person.

22

Tattle and what -- went on to say at page 18-A, that

23

is to say the discovery they need to prove their

24

case.

25

QUESTION:

All contacts between any

And then what Judge

The point is it's different,

58
Alderson Reporting Company

1

isn't it?

2

GENERAL OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

It's -­

They want stuff on discovery

4

that has to do with who said what to who.

5

they win, they get a different set of things which

6

are the documents of agendas, et cetera.

7

GENERAL OLSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

GENERAL OLSON:

And if

Well, it's -­

Is that right?
It's different, but it --

10

everything that they have asked for in those requests

11

for admissions and those interrogatories, Justice

12

Breyer, include everything they would get under FACA

13

and a whole lot more.

14

about that.

15

So -- and there is no question

Now, with respect to the subordinate

16

working groups, a point was made with respect to the

17

President's directive, that the President said the

18

Vice President may establish subordinate working

19

groups to assist.

20

at page 240 of the Joint Appendix specifically says

21

that the Vice President authorized that, but the Vice

22

President did not establish any such subordinate

23

working groups.

24
25

The declaration that's in the file

And then the declaration goes on to say
that there was only a public citizen that was

4

in the litigation, participated in the working group

5

formulation.

6

And that was the only person that was
No such individuals, the individuals named

What we are saying here is that the

7

constitutional immunity from discovery that we are

8

talking about here is rooted in the overriding

9

presumption of regularity, which, if repealed in this

10

case, would repeal -- if overridden in this case

11

would repeal the exemption under FACA for all

12

government working groups.

13

And these are exclusive functions,

14

textually committed to the President of the United

15

States getting opinions from his subordinates.

16

your question suggested, Justice Breyer, virtually

17

anything that the President might do, asking the

18

Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General

19

for this or that to formulate something, and they go

20

out to talk to people, that could be a -- that would

21

be a FACA lawsuit in a heartbeat.

22

As

There is no statute that creates the right

23

that the Petitioners seek here.

There is no, there

24

is no cause of action under FACA, and there is, no,
