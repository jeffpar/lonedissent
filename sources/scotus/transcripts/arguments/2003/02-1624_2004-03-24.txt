ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. CASSIDY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance

12

to the flag by millions of school children across our

13

country does not violate the Establishment Clause.

14

Petitioners submit that the decision of the Ninth Circuit

15

Court of Appeals was incorrect for two reasons.

16

respondent lacks standing to assert the claims in this

17

case, and second, the school district policy of willing

18

students reciting the pledge with the words, one nation

19

under God, is a patriotic exercise that is part of an

20

unbroken history of official government acknowledgment of

21

the role of religion in American life.

22

First,

The issue of standing in this case is one of

23

first impression for this Court.

Respondent seeks to

24

invoke the aid of a Federal court to override the state

25

family law court in an ongoing custody dispute.

We look

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to the state law to define the rights of parents involved

2

in custody disputes.

effect both at the time this matter was pending before the

4

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as before this

5

Court -­

The state court custody order in

QUESTION: Counsel -­

7

MR. CASSIDY: -- has limited -­

8

QUESTION: Counsel, on the standing issue,

9

normally, I guess, we defer to the courts of appeals in

10

deciding issues of state law.

11

Supreme Court hasn't really weighed in on this question

12

and the Ninth Circuit seems to have relied on some court

13

of appeals decisions in making its decision about

14

standing.

15

Now, I guess the California

Now, normally we would just defer to that,

16

wouldn't we, and move on to the merits?

17

reason why we shouldn't do that here?

18

Is there some

MR. CASSIDY: Well, it is our position, Your

19

Honor, that the Ninth Circuit made an incorrect analysis

20

in -­

21

QUESTION: Well, maybe they did, but is it not

22

the case that we normally defer to courts of appeals on

23

questions of state law on issues of standing?

24
25

MR. CASSIDY: I would say the Court does defer at
times.

However, the Court has the right, and in this case

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the obligation, to reassess the rights when those are

2

incorrectly decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

3

In this -­

4

QUESTION: Is this just a question of Article III

5

standing or would it be open to us under our precedents to

6

say that we think there's Article III standing, but this

7

really involves rights of third parties, and as a

8

prudential matter, we do not think it's appropriate to

9

exercise jurisdiction -­

10

MR. CASSIDY: I think, Justice -­

11

QUESTION: Because, as I understand certainly the

12

Government's brief, and I think yours, you don't argue

13

prudential standing, it's just a question, an Article III

14

question.

15

Would you -­
MR. CASSIDY: Well, I would say both, Your Honor,

16

that the respondent is not a stakeholder within the

17

meaning of Article III. However, we would likewise submit

18

that I think that prudential argument was vis-a-vis the

19

Rooker-Feldman doctrine.

20

Court not interfere with the state court ongoing custody

21

dispute on that basis, because essentially this is one of

22

a collateral attack of a state court proceeding.

23

We have requested that this

QUESTION: Well, I -- I saw the Rooker-Feldman

24

cite.

I just wonder if you have any other authority for

25

the fact that there's a prudential standing problem here

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and then you cite us a case other than Rooker v. Feldman,

2

would be Craig and Boren or Rescue Army or something?

3

MR. CASSIDY: I don't know that it -- this case

4

fits precisely in either the Rooker-Feldman or other

5

prudential cases, but we do have a case that certainly

6

merits that type of consideration.

7

should defer and not interfere with what amounts to the

8

mother's rights and interests in the upbringing,

9

educational upbringing of the daughter.

10

We believe this Court

Second -­

QUESTION: Well, then that gets us to Article

11

III, the father says that it's not a level playing field,

12

that he has a right under state law and he might even have

13

a constitutional right to have some access to the -- to

14

the child and to try to affect the child's development,

15

and that the state is tilting the balance,

16

unconstitutionally he could say.

17
18
19

MR. CASSIDY: Well, we would certainly disagree
with that position, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, but I mean, that's -- it's just

20

a question of standing.

21

standing to make that claim?

22

Does -- does -- he has no

MR. CASSIDY: Well, I think it's -- the best way

23

to approach this is whether respondent has a legally

24

protected interest, which he does not.

25

legally protected right.

He does not have a

Therefore, he is not a

the question of legally protected right to zero in on

this.

6

friend standing aside for a moment.

7

and you correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand it, he's

8

saying, look, simply as the father of this child, I have

9

an interest which is in fact being infringed here.

Put Rooker-Feldman aside for a moment, put next
As I understand it,

Even

10

though under state law the mother of the child has the

11

right to cast the final decision on matters of morals,

12

education, religion, I nonetheless have an interest as a

13

father, and that interest is in seeing that my child is

14

not subjected to what I believe is an unconstitutional

15

religious interest or religious influence.

16
17
18

What is your answer to his claim that that is
enough to give him personal standing?
MR. CASSIDY: I have to answer that question,

19

Justice Souter, based upon how the school district

20

perceives respondent's rights, and in this case, the

21

school district must look to only a single decision-maker.

22

It's the only way a school district can function.

23

the same way this Court should approach, we would suggest,

24

the standing issue.

25

It's

QUESTION: Well, the mother isn't a decision­

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

maker for the school district, neither is the father a

2

decision-maker.

3

it's ultimately going to be a judicial decision-maker on

4

the constitutional question.

5

a right to raise that question by virtue of my interest as

6

a father, even though at the present time under state law

7

I cannot control her presence or absence at the school.

8
9

If there's going to be a decision-maker,

He is simply saying, I have

MR. CASSIDY: We would submit, Justice Souter,
that the question is truly what is in the best interest of

10

the child.

11

we look to parents' rights in custody disputes under state

12

law.

13

That's ultimately the determination made when

QUESTION: But aren't -- aren't you basically

14

answering the question as if I were asking you a next

15

friend standing question?

16

in court as next friend is between these two parents.

17

asking the question simply about his interest, not as next

18

friend but as father, admittedly with limited rights.

19

Who should stand for the child
I'm

MR. CASSIDY: With limited rights, his rights

20

become on a more abstract level.

21

of the degree that provide a legally protectable interest

22

in asserting those rights.

23

QUESTION:

They are certainly not

His right to redress -­
California says otherwise.

It says

24

he has the right to have an equal shot at trying to

25

influence and raise this child and that this is his right.

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CASSIDY: The reason, Justice Kennedy, that

2

we look to the state law to define those rights is that

3

because when there are custody disputes, the court directs

4

which parent gets the ultimate decision-making

5

responsibility and authority.

6

In this case -­

QUESTION: Yes, but the judge didn't tell him to

7

-- to discontinue the litigation, did he?

8

tolerated the prosecution of the case?

9

The judge has

MR. CASSIDY: We would submit, Justice Stevens,

10

that the state judge cannot determine an Article III

11

standing.

12

The judge -­
QUESTION: Well, he could certainly tell the

13

father, this is not in the best interest of the child,

14

discontinue the litigation.

15

that, at least to say, you can't bring this suit

16

purporting to represent the best interests of the child.

17

He would have authority to do

MR. CASSIDY: But when the respondent bypasses

18

the state court, the respond -- the record reflects that

19

respondent and the mother met with the principal and the

20

kindergarten teacher of the daughter and respondent wanted

21

to -­

22
23

QUESTION: But that doesn't go to the question of
whether he can maintain the litigation.

24

MR. CASSIDY: But -­

25

QUESTION:

That's a standing issue as to whether

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

he can bring this lawsuit.

2

MR. CASSIDY: But certainly if he bypasses the

3

state court and never has a determination made as to

4

whether this is in the best interest of the daughter,

5

you're correct.

6

You would not have that decision.
QUESTION: But she never asked for a relief along

7

that line.

8

asked to tell him to discontinue the lawsuit.

9

She -- as I understand it, the mother never

MR. CASSIDY: Well, she certainly sought

10

dismissal in a -- in a manner of speaking from the Ninth

11

Circuit Court of Appeals, and/or to intervene to -- to

12

demonstrate to the -­

13

QUESTION: And I think -­

14

MR. CASSIDY: -- Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

15
16
17
18

as to what was in the best interest of her daughter.
QUESTION: Yeah, but the judge said the daughter
could go hear him argue the case as I understand it.
MR. CASSIDY: But likewise in this Court the

19

judge said she could not.

So we have a situation where we

20

have to defer in a custody dispute like this to the state

21

court's judgment as to what's ultimately in the best

22

interest of the child.

23

at the rights as defined, the ultimate decision-making

24

authority is with the mother in this case, and the reason

25

that the courts adopt that is consistent with the

2

under the California education code, the school districts

3

have to have only one decision-maker.

4

couldn't function properly when there are disagreements

with parents that are involved in custody disputes.

6

Otherwise, they

In referencing that code section, California

7

education code section 51100 sub D, in relation to the

8

rights of parents to participate in the education of their

9

children, the California education code specifically

10

provides, this section does not authorize a school to

11

permit participation by a parent in the education of a

12

child if it conflicts with a valid order for custody

13

issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

14
15

With that, I would like to reserve the remainder
of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

court with specialized expertise and continuing

jurisdiction has determined that the best interests of the

MR. OLSON: Well, we submit, Justice Kennedy,

18

that a fair reading of what -- what the domestic relations

19

20

focused in on the legally protected rights of the -- with

a legally protected right to challenge the conditions in

He's claiming a right,

This record is relatively clear, not only with

with respect to the decisions, the transcript of the

court, and the order that the court issued on January 9 of

5

this year with respect to what was damaging to the

6

interests of the child.

7

brought this case when he had joint custody without

8

consulting with the mother, the trial court found here

that it was unconscionable to bring this case, especially

10

when he knew that it might adversely affect the interests

of the child.

In fact, when the respondent

We submit that, under this Court's rulings with

MR. OLSON: We -- we do also, Justice Kennedy.

21

QUESTION: What's your best authority?

22

MR. OLSON: Well, I -- first of all, there's two.

23

It's Rooker-Feldman in the sense that what -- recognizing

24

standing here will have the effect of disturbing and

25

upsetting the effect of the trial court, of the domestic

1

relations court's decision with respect to the best

2

interests of the child.

3

Secondly, with respect to the Ankenbrandt case

4

where the Court has decided that the Federal courts don't

5

have jurisdiction with respect to domestic, the so-called

6

domestic relations exception, and that was specifically

7

referred to include divorce, alimony, and custody.

8

there are those -- those factors all come together with -­

9

with respect to describing the legally protected interest

So

10

of the -- of the defendant -- of the respondent in this

11

case with respect to the matters involving the child.

12

QUESTION: Is this your argument, Mr. Olson?

13

-- in determining whether we should recognize his next

14

friend standing, we should take into consideration the

15

state custody arrangements and the state judgments about

16

what is in the best interests of the child.

17

the second question, should we recognize his individual

18

standing, if we do recognize his individual standing, but

19

we don't recognize his standing as next friend, we will

20

undercut the interests which are being protected by

21

refusing to recognize his standing as next friend.

22

got to go, in effect, we've got to come to the same

23

conclusion in each case or we will undercut our conclusion

24

on -- on next friend standing if it's adverse.

the court in that case recognized the special expertise of

sensitive matters.

With respect to that, this Court would

QUESTION: But the -- the merits here certainly

9
10

have nothing to do with domestic relations.
MR. OLSON: The -- well, and they do in the sense

11

that they -- the -- the matters that are before this Court

12

with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance in the public

13

school has to do with the child's education and impacts

14

with respect -- and there is in the record, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, affidavits from the mother expressing her concern

16

about the effect on the child of being thrust into the

17

vortex of this constitutional case.

18

One decision-maker has to make decisions with

19

respect to the best interests of the child and the

20

collision of those interests, and that comes into play

21

because the child is the one that -- it's interesting that

22

the respondent's brief are full of references to the

23

interests of the child, the alleged coercive effect of the

24

Pledge of Allegiance, the impact on the child's rights and

QUESTION: Without benefit of brief and oral
argument.

4

MR. OLSON: Well, they -- there were references

to the case in -- of -- of course in the briefs and -- and

6

in connection with the case, but the fact is that the

7

Court was distinguishing, and the Court repeatedly said

8

that, that there is a major distinction between those

10

of the Ten Commandments, or in the evolution cases.

respondent cites nine cases that he says support the

proposition that he's articulating.

of other cases where the Court has considered the issue of

MR. OLSON: Well, the -- the Court held in West

Virginia v. Barnette that persons of conscience being

8

occurred at a time before the pledge was amended.

That was saluting the flag.

MR. OLSON: That was the Pledge of Allegiance to

the flag, but -- but that's the same thing that's

13

happening here, Mr. Chief Justice, that the child are

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION: Because it's a terribly important

12
13

question.
MR. OLSON: It's an important question because

14

the reference to under God in the pledge, as numerous

15

decisions of this Court have indicated in dicta, what as a

16

part of a -- of a thought process of coming about to the

17

conclusion that it -- it is an acknowledgment of the

18

religious basis of the framers of the Constitution, who

19

believed not only that the right to revolt, but that the

20

right to vest power in the people to create a government

21

became -- came as a result of religious principles.

22

that sense, the Pledge of Allegiance is today, that has

23

that same significance to this country as it did in 1954

24

when it was amended.

25

In

But as this Court has also said, and that's the

also said the ceremonial rendition of the Pledge of

QUESTION: Your -- your argument is that there's

11

a stronger case now than there would have been 50 years

12

ago?

13

MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that is

14

for many reasons, for -- because of the reason that I just

15

made, but also because the Congress revisited this issue

16

in 2002 after the decision below in this case.

17

findings in the record which are a part of the brief, with

18

respect to what the -- what the pledge means, the context

19

of the pledge in its historical context, in the connection

20

with its civic invocation, its ability to invoke certain

21

principles that are indisputably true, which gave rise to

22

the institutions which have given us freedom over all this

23

period of time.

24
25

There are

It's in -- it is significant that the Court in,
the Congress, in making those findings, specifically

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

referred to the decisions that I was referring to before,

2

which have been characterized as dicta, but very important

3

dicta, because they explain how the Court came to its

4

conclusions.

5

So those are differences.

The other difference

6

that should be made is that the challenge here too is not

7

directly to the Pledge of Allegiance, but it's to the

8

invocation or the -- the articulation of the Pledge of

9

Allegiance in the Elk Grove School District. The State of

10

California requires those patriotic exercises in that

11

school district under the phrase, patriotic

12

responsibilities of the schools, or words to that effect,

13

and that -- and the school district itself puts this in

14

the category of a patriotic exercise.

15

And to go back to what this Court has taught us

16

with respect to the Establishment Clause and the

17

endorsement prong of the Establishment Clause, it's the

18

entire context.

19

of Allegiance to the flag and to the nation for which it

20

stands, and then a descriptive phrase, under God,

21

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22

It's the nation's history, it's a Pledge

7

QUESTION: In their own way.

8

MR. OLSON: -- without saying any words.

9

They

can decide not to participate in the pledge at all, and I

10

think that's covered by the West Virginia v. Barnette

11

decision of this Court.

12

this point before my time elapses, is that the respondent

13

makes a point of saying, this is the same as requiring the

14

pledge to say one nation under Jesus.

15

different.

16

framers of our Constitution repeatedly referred to God,

17

Lord, the creator, and there's a very interesting piece of

18

history with respect to that.

The -- the -- and I want to make

That is completely

It's not supported by the history where the

19

When the Virginia bill of establishing religious

20

freedom was articulated, they -- they used the phrase, the

21

holy author.

22

was published in 1811, said there was a motion to amend to

23

refer to the holy author, Jesus Christ, and he said in his

24

autobiography that that was rejected because the framers

25

of the Virginia Bill of Rights, or act establishing

Thomas Jefferson in his autobiography, which

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

religious freedom, which is a precursor to the

2

Establishment Clause, was intended not to include any

3

particular sect, but to -- to apply to Jews, Hindus,

4

Mohammedens, and it even says the word infidels in Thomas

5

Jefferson's explanation for the background of that act.

6

In -- in summary, the state -- the Pledge of

7

Allegiance is not what this Court has said the

8

Establishment Clause protects against, that is to say,

9

state-sponsored prayers, religious rituals or ceremonies,

10

or the imposition or the requirement of teaching or not

11

teaching a religious doctrine.

12

The Establishment Clause does not prohibit civic and

13

ceremonial acknowledgments of the indisputable historical

14

fact of the religious heritage that caused the framers of

15

our Constitution and the signers of the Declaration of

16

Independence to say that they had the right to revolt and

17

start a new country, because although the king was

18

infallible, they believe that God gave them the right to

19

declare their independence when the king has not been

20

living up to the unalienable principles given to them by

21

God.

ARGUME

NT OF MICHAEL A. NEWDOW
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. NEWDOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

6

Every school morning in the Elk Grove Unified

7

School District's public schools, government agents,

8

teachers, funded with tax dollars, have their students

9

stand up, including my daughter, face the flag of the

10

United States of America, place their hands over their

11

hearts, and affirm that ours is a nation under some

12

particular religious entity, the appreciation of which is

13

not accepted by numerous people, such as myself.

14

cannot in good conscience accept the idea that there

15

exists a deity.

16

I am an atheist.

We

I don't believe in God.

17

every school morning my child is asked to stand up, face

18

that flag, put her hand over her heart, and say that her

19

father is wrong.

20

And

QUESTION: Well now, let's -- let's talk first

21

about standing.

You only give it two pages in your brief.

22

It -- it seems to me important to recognize that these

23

aren't just technical rules that we lawyers are interested

24

in, but that there's a common sense component to it.

25

you are asking the Court to exercise the extraordinary,

And

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the breathtaking power to declare Federal law

2

unconstitutional, and the common sense of the matter, it

3

seems to me, is that your daughter is -- is the one that

4

bears the blame for this.

5

outcry, the public outrage, and we take the case, I think,

6

on the assumption that even at her tender years she

7

probably doesn't agree with that and that her mother

8

certainly doesn't.

9

She's going to face the public

And it seems to me that your insisting on

10

standing here contradicts that common sense core of the

11

standing rule, which is -- and I'm just talking about her

12

standing, I'm not talking about yours -- that the common

13

sense core of the standing rule is, when a citizen wants

14

the courts to exercise this awful power, that they take

15

the consequences, and you're putting that on her.

16

the common sense of the matter to me, Mr. Newdow.

17

That's

MR. NEWDOW: I would answer that in two ways.

18

First of all, Palmore v. Sidoti says that we shouldn't

19

look at the harms that occur to people as a result of

20

prejudices of our society.

21

is being violated, if in -- and there are consequences

22

from people trying to uphold the Constitution, that just

23

happens to happen.

24

-- going to be adverse consequences to my daughter.

daughter's going to be able to walk around and say that my

2

States.

3

QUESTION: Maybe so, maybe no, but the rule of

4

standing is that the person who brings the suit has to

5

affirm that they have that stake now when the suit is

6

brought, and she doesn't.

7

MR. NEWDOW: Correct, but I'm not bringing this

8

in her behalf, that was taken out.

9

my behalf, and my child -­

10

I'm bringing this in

QUESTION: That's -- that's a different point

11

altogether, but if she has no standing, then it seems to

12

me the next question is whether or not the rights that you

13

assert, and I understand what they are, do seem to

14

undercut her position.

15

MR. NEWDOW: They may well do that, but she's a

16

separate entity.

I have a right of standing, and the

17

question that this Court has is merely, do I have that

18

right.

And my daughter is told every morning -­

19

QUESTION: Yet -- but see, then -- then you're

20

getting back to your daughter.

It seems to me this case

21

has to be about your rights, and you began this argument

22

by talking about your daughter and you're talking about

23

her now.

24

serious concerns about her standing, and so it seems to me

25

that her position is irrelevant.

I think she has, at least we'll say, I have

MR. NEWDOW: And I agree with that, Your Honor.

2

I am saying I as her father have a right to know that when

3

she goes into the public schools she's not going to be

4

told every morning to be asked to stand up, put her hand

5

over her heart, and say your father is wrong, which is

6

what she's told every morning.

7

concrete, discrete, particularized, individualized harm to

8

me, which gives me standing, and not only gives me

9

standing, demonstrates to this Court how the -­

10
11

That is an actual,

QUESTION: Well, she does have a right not to
participate.

12

MR. NEWDOW: She has a -- yes, except under Lee

v. Weisman she's clearly coerced to participate.

does not require prayer.

19

the Americans United brief, stated himself that when we

QUESTION: Yeah, but I suppose reasonable people
could look at the pledge as not constituting a prayer.

constitute a prayer.

6

QUESTION: What -- what you say is, I pledge

7

allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and

8

to the republic for which it stands.

9

doesn't sound like anything like a prayer.

So that certainly

10

MR. NEWDOW: Not at all.

11

QUESTION: Then why isn't General Olson's

12

categorization of the remainder as descriptive, one nation

13

under God, with liberty and justice for all?

14

disagree it's under God, you can disagree that it's -- has

15

a liberty and justice for all, but that doesn't make it a

16

prayer.

17

You can

MR. NEWDOW: First of all, I don't think that we

18

want our -- that the purpose of the Pledge of Allegiance

19

is to disagree that it's liberty and justice for all.

20

think the whole purpose of the pledge is to say that, and

21

this Court has stated it's an affirmation of belief, an

22

attitude of mind when we pledge, and I think you have to

23

take all the words.

25

amazing child to suddenly come up with this knowledge of

founded on.

that they ask the children to stand and to sing the -- the

And as a matter of fact, we can look at the

training, religious interest.

religion, and to suggest that this is merely historical or

13

patriotic seems to me to be somewhat disingenuous.

14

All of this has to do with

QUESTION: I mean, it's pretty, it's a pretty

15

broad use of religion sometimes.

I -- does it make you

16

feel any better, and I think the answer's going to be no,

17

but there is a case called Seeger, which referred to the

18

Constitution -- to the statute that used the word, supreme

19

being, and it said that those words, supreme being,

20

included a set of beliefs, sincere beliefs, which in any

21

ordinary person's life fills the same place as a belief in

22

God fills in the life of an orthodox religionist.

23

reaching out to be inclusive, maybe to include you, I

24

mean, to -- because many people who are not religious

25

nonetheless have a set of beliefs which occupy the same

place that religious beliefs occupy in the mind and woman

of a religious -- of a religious mind in men and women.

So do you think God is so generic in this
context that it could be that inclusive?

5

MR. NEWDOW: I think -­

6

QUESTION: And if it is, then does your objection

7

disappear?

8

MR. NEWDOW: I don't think so, because if I'm not

9

mistaken with regard to Seeger, Seeger -- the Government

10

was saying what Seeger thought about religion and what's

11

occupied in Seeger's mind.

12

there's a crucial difference between government speech

13

endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause

14

forbids, and -- and private speech endorsing religion,

15

which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.

16

And in that case we're talking about protecting that

17

individual's right for him to say in his view that this

18

occupies the same thing as God.

19

Here it is the Government and

Here we're talking about government, everybody

20

on the way here is government.

It's Congress that stuck

21

the two words, under God, into the pledge, clearly for a

religious purpose.

23

says, go ahead, use the Pledge of Allegiance, which is now

24

religious.

QUESTION: But what I'm thinking there is that

2

perhaps when you get that broad in your idea of what is

3

religious, so it can encompass a set of religious-type

4

beliefs in the minds of people who are not traditionally

5

religious, when you are that broad and in a civic context,

6

it really doesn't violate the Establishment Clause because

7

it's meant to include virtually everybody, and the few

8

whom it doesn't include don't have to take the pledge.

9
10

MR. NEWDOW: You're referring to the two words,
under God?

11
12

QUESTION: Yeah, under God is this kind of very
comprehensive supreme being, Seeger-type thing.

13

MR. NEWDOW: I don't think that I can include

14

under God to mean no God, which is exactly what I think.

15

I deny the existence of God, and for someone to tell me

16

that under God should mean some broad thing that even

17

encompasses my religious beliefs sounds a little, you

18

know, it seems like the Government is imposing what it

19

wants me to think of in terms of religion, which it may

20

not do.

21

QUESTION: How about what the ending of every

problematic because it's a specific Lord and not a generic

MR. NEWDOW: Well, I would note that this Court

for people who find that offensive.

There's an option here too.

The child does not have

to say it at all, can say it except for the words, under

MR. NEWDOW: I think that's a huge imposition to

put on a small child.

30 Christians there and you say to this child, let's all

out that once again you're arguing based on the child, and

MR. NEWDOW: I think the argument I'm trying to

make, and I may not be making it well, is that government

is doing this to my child.

just did, that we are -- the school district is making her

an atheist, you're -- you're certainly overstating the

MR. NEWDOW: I'm not -­

8

QUESTION: There's no indication that she is an

9

atheist.

10

MR. NEWDOW: I'm not saying either.

I'm -- I'm

11

saying that she -- that my right to inculcate my religious

12

beliefs includes the right to know that government will

13

not in the public schools influence her one way in -- or

14

the other.

15

to start off the morning, say put your hand on your heart,

that your father has told you doesn't exist, and

19

government may not do that.

And government is coming in here every morning

QUESTION: What -- what do you make of -- of this

21

argument?

I will assume, and I -- I do assume, that -­

22

that if you read the pledge carefully, the -- the

23

reference to under God means something more than a mere

24

description of how somebody else once thought.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

republic is then described as being under God, and I think

2

a fair reading of that would -- would be I think that's

3

the way the republic ought to be conceived, as under God.

4

So I think -- I think there's some affirmation there.

5

will grant you that.

6

I

What do you make of the argument that in actual

7

practice the -- the -- the affirmation in the midst of

8

this civic exercise as a religious affirmation is -- is so

9

tepid, so diluted then so far, let's say, from a

10

compulsory prayer that in fact it -- it should be, in

11

effect, beneath the constitutional radar.

12

sometimes, you know the phrase, the Rostow phrase, the

13

ceremonial deism.

14

It's -- it's

What -- what do you make of -- of that argument,

15

even -- even assuming that, as I do, that there is some

16

affirmation involved when the child says this as a

17

technical matter?

18

MR. NEWDOW: I think that that whole concept goes

19

completely against the ideals underlying the Establishment

20

Clause.

Virginia v. Barnette something that most people don't

22

consider to be religious at all to be of essential

He said in his

7

in civic society in which the pledge is made, that the -­

8

that whatever is distinctively religious as an affirmation

is simply lost.

I think the argument is that

It -- it's not that the -- that the

10

Government is saying, you've got to pretend that it's

11

lost.

12

religious, as distinct from a civic content, is close to

13

disappearing here.

14

The argument is that it is lost, that the

MR. NEWDOW: And again, I -- I don't mean to go

15

back, but it seems to me that is a view that you may

16

choose to take and the majority of Americans may choose to

17

take, but it doesn't -- it's not the view I take, and when

18

I see the flag and I think of pledging allegiance, I -­

19

it's like I'm getting slapped in the face every time, bam,

20

you -- you know, this is a nation under God, your

21

religious belief system is wrong.

22

And here, I want to be able to tell my child

23

that I have a very valid religious belief system.

Go to

church with your mother, go see Buddhists, do anything you

25

want, I love that -- the idea that she's being exposed to

other things, but I want my religious belief system to be

2

given the same weight as everybody else's.

religious belief system is wrong and the mother's is right

and anyone else who believes in God is right, and this

QUESTION: If you had her in this courtroom and

she stood up when the Justices entered and she heard the

11

be exactly the same, so you would have equal standing on

12

your account of things to challenge that as you do to

13

challenge what the school district does here?

14

MR. NEWDOW: I don't think the injury would be

15

even close to the same.

If it's just, let's sing one song a

10
11

This

12

America, as religion?

13

you'd sing in church?

14

It's -- it's indoctrinating

It's not exactly like a hymn that

MR. NEWDOW: No, and again, if it were used for

15

the purpose to say that there exists a God, then I think

16

it would violate the Constitution.

and this is one of many songs, then it would be fine.

here there's nothing else in the Pledge of Allegiance,

QUESTION: Well, we're -- I don't know.

I mean,

24

that's the point where -- I have no doubt that it offends

25

you and I respect the fact that you're -- your right to be

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

offended.

I understand that.

But the question is whether

2

Congress, whether -- whether the -- whether the Government

3

has the power to work that kind of offense.

4

because you say, well, it doesn't have the right.

5

why doesn't it have the right?

6

in fact, you have a very broad understanding of God.

7

not a prayer, it's in a ceremonial context, and it has a

8

long history of being evoked for civic purposes.

9

course, some people will be offended, but those people who

And on that,
Well,

It isn't that divisive if,
It's

Of

are offended can in fact ask the child, where they have

11

custody, to be excused or not to say the words, under God.

12

So it's not perfect, it's not perfect, but it serves

13

a purpose of unification at the price of offending a small

14

number of people like you.

15

-- why the country cannot do that?

16

So tell me from ground one why

MR. NEWDOW: Well, first of all, for 62 years

17

this pledge did serve the purpose of unification and it

18

did do it perfectly.

19

dogma that separated out some -- and I don't think there's

20

anything in the Constitution that says what percentage of

21

people get separated out.

22

that example that I raised before with one nation under

Jesus.

24

relatively in our country.

25

It's about 86 percent to 93 percent, somewhere in that

vicinity, so we're separating out another amount of

2

people, but again, the principle is the same.

3

separating out people.

4

We are

We don't need to.

Again, the Pledge of Allegiance did absolutely

5

fine and with -- got us through two world wars, got us

6

through the Depression, got us through everything without

7

God, and Congress stuck God in there for that particular

8

reason, and the idea that it's not divisive I think is

9

somewhat, you know, shown to be questionable at least by

10

what happened in the result of the Ninth Circuit's

11

opinion.

12

upset that God was going to be taken out of the Pledge of

13

Allegiance.

The country went berserk because people were so

14

QUESTION: Do we know -- do we know what the vote

15

was in Congress apropos of divisiveness to adopt the under

was no objection.

There's no count of the vote.

21

QUESTION: Well, that doesn't sound divisive.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. NEWDOW: It doesn't sound divisive if -­

24

that's only because no atheist can get elected to public

25

office.

The studies show that 48 percent of the

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

population cannot get elected.

2

(Applause.)

3

QUESTION: The courtroom will be cleared if

4

there's any more clapping.

5

Proceed, Mr. Newdow.

MR. NEWDOW: The -- there are right now in eight

6

states in their constitutions provisions that say things

7

like South Carolina's constitution, no person who denies

8

the existence of a supreme being shall hold any office

9

under this constitution.

Among those eight states there's

10

1328, I believe the number of legislators, not one of

11

which has tried to get that -- those phrases out of their

12

state constitutions, because they know, should they do

13

that, they'll never get re-elected, because nobody likes

14

somebody to stand up for atheists, and that's one of the

15

key problems, and we perpetuate that every day when we

16

say, okay class, including Newdow's daughter, stand up,

17

put your hand on your heart and pledge, affirm that we are

18

a nation under God.

19

QUESTION: You have a clear free exercise right

20

to get at those laws, wouldn't you, that you recited that

21

said atheists can't run for office, atheists can't do this

22

or that?

23

would it not?

24
25

That -- that would be plainly unconstitutional,

MR. NEWDOW: That would be, yes.

Those clauses

are clearly nullities at this time in view of Torcaso v.

MR. NEWDOW: However, they still exist.

And the

fact that those clauses, I mean, we saw what happened to

14

around, it's been there, in eight states right now today

15

in 2004.

That would be there for

But no atheists?

Hey, let it stick

16

QUESTION: Well, if anyone challenged that -­

17

QUESTION: May I ask you the same question I

18

asked just General Olson?

19

under God, in the pledge, and I think of things like, in

20

God we trust, on the dollar bill, which nobody really

21

cares very much about anymore, but do you think the words,

22

under God, in the Pledge of Allegiance have the same

23

meaning today that they did to the country when the words

24

were inserted in the -- in the pledge?

25

Do you think that the words,

MR. NEWDOW: I would merely note that 99 out of

it has enormous significance to the American public and

that's why this is important.

10
11

The President of the United States in a press

It was on the

This is supposed to be one
I think clearly

That's why this case is so

critical.
QUESTION: And that's why you would not take the

12

same position with regard to the words, in God we trust,

13

on the dollar bill?

14

MR. NEWDOW: I -- I think this Court can easily

15

distinguish that situation from here, where we're asking

16

children to stand up, being coerced in the setting, hold

17

your hand over your heart and pledge your own personal

18

affirmation to some religious entity.

19

even supposed to be anywhere near this question.

20

Government's supposed to stay out of the religion

21

business, and here it came into it, it was completely

22

unnecessary, and Congress said in 1954, in House Report

23

1693, the inclusion of God in the pledge, therefore -- and

24

they didn't use the phrase, under God, they said the

25

entity God -- the inclusion of God in the pledge,

Government is not

1

therefore, would further acknowledge the dependence of our

2

people and our Government upon the moral directions of the

3

creator and we'll note it wasn't a creator, it was the

4

creator, the Christian creator and we know that because

5

when they put the flag up the flagpole, they played Onward

6

Christian Soldiers Marching as to War.

7

I mean, this is -- clearly we know what was

8

going on here.

It was to get religion in our government,

9

and the outcry that came when the Ninth Circuit issued its

10

opinion shows that people still want their religious

11

beliefs in our government.

12

is fine, they can do anything they want in the public

13

schools, they can go into class, they can do whatever they

14

want, but the Free Exercise Clause has never meant that a

15

majority may use the machinery of the state to practice

16

its beliefs, and that's precisely what we have in this

17

situation.

18

And the Free Exercise Clause

Again, I would point out that this Court, every

19

member of this Court has demanded neutrality.

Seven

20

members of this Court, six sitting today, have said that

21

we need -- that have authored their own opinions that say

22

that we need neutrality, and here we have the

23

quintessential religious question, does there exist a God?

24

And government has come in, yes, there exists a God.

25

is not neutrality by any means.

QUESTION: What -- what -- is there any merit to

2

the argument that there's a difference in a religious

exercise and a pledge -- in the pledge -- or has that been

of Congress was -­

are religious exercises?

20

MR. NEWDOW: Well, I think religious exercise is

21

a larger set, prayer is a subset.

22

President of the United States considers the pledge in

23

that subset.

somewhat, I think irrelevant, because the question --

I would say again the

QUESTION: Which -- which clearly there was in

5

Lee v. Weisman.

6

MR. NEWDOW: Correct.

7

QUESTION: Why -- why is this a religious

8

exercise, or -- or is it?

9

MR. NEWDOW: I think it definitely is, and it is

10

because the two words are, under God, and I can't see of

11

anything that's not religious under God, and again, I

12

would point out in the standing argument made by the Elk

13

Grove Unified School District, they repeatedly reference

14

the fact it's the whole issue here with the mother is

15

because she directs the, quote, religious upbringing.

16

There wasn't anything about -­

17

QUESTION: Well, let -- let's assume that in Lee

18

v. Weisman it was 100 percent prayer, let's just assume

19

that.

20

MR. NEWDOW: Okay.

21

QUESTION: Is there -- this is maybe only -­

22

you've probably figured out, 5 percent prayer under your ­

23

- your view -­

24

MR. NEWDOW: Well, I don't think -­

25

QUESTION: -- under your view.

1

MR. NEWDOW: That -- that's one of the issues

2

that -- that gets confusing.

3

look at what it -- the religious part, and then the

4

question is, what are you going to define that as being

5

encompassed in?

6

within the context of the graduation and I think it was

7

like an hour and a half for the graduation and two minutes

8

for the prayer.

9

The question is, when you

In Lee v. Weisman, it was the prayer

So here we have, I think, if you actually

10

multiply and look at the ratio, the ratio of the two

11

words, under God, to the Pledge of Allegiance is greater

12

than the ratio of the time spent on prayer versus the

13

graduation exercise in Lee v. Weisman.

14

with anything.

15

know, we -- if you talk about the staircase and just

16

being, you know, this individual thing, we could say,

17

well, the staircase is this -- this transportation mode

18

just like here the pledge is this patriotic mode.

19

You can do that

We have Allegheny County showing, you

But the question is, why did you stick the

20

creche in the middle of this grand staircase?

The

21

question is here, why did you stick these two purely

22

religious words, under God, in the middle of the Pledge of

23

Allegiance?

24

a purely religious purpose, we have purely religious

25

effects, it fails the endorsement test, it fails the

So I would say that it's clear here there is

outsider test.

Imagine you're this one child with a class

2

full of theists and you -- you're -- you have this idea

3

that you want to perhaps at least consider and you have

4

everyone imposing their view on you, it fails every test

5

this Court has ever come up with, and there's a principle

6

here and I'm hoping the Court will uphold this principle

7

so that we can finally go back and have every American

8

want to stand up, face the flag, place their hand over

9

their heart and pledge to one nation, indivisible, not

10

divided by religion, with liberty and justice for all.

11

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Newdow.

12

Mr. Cassidy, you have five minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. CASSIDY: I would like to take this

16

opportunity to respond to several points.

17

Lynch we know that acknowledgment of the role of religion

18

in American society is not exercising religion, nor is it

19

endorsing religion.

20

First, under

Second, respondent has stated his daughter is

21

being required to stand up and say the pledge.

His

22

daughter is not required to stand up and say the pledge.

23

It is the parents' choice, the parent chooses whether the

24

child recites the pledge.

25

exercised her legal right under the state custody order

In this case, the mother has

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and we have discussed that previously, but therefore, Mr.

2

-- respondent's recourse is to object to the mother's

3

decision, to seek his recourse in state court for the

4

mother's decision, because there is a lack of a causal

5

relationship with respect to his not having a legally

6

protectable right to assert what he seems to be asserting

7

in this case, that it is his daughter who is affected by

8

the pledge.

9

Third, following Barnette, schools across the

10

country, including the Elk Grove Unified School District,

11

have developed a number of procedures to accommodate

12

students who wish to opt out of the pledge exercise.

13

do so by consulting with the teachers and the principals,

14

who are in the best position to know how to adopt that to

15

the various class members.

16

several ways that a child could opt out and exercise the

17

rights that were developed post-Barnette.

18

They

In particular, there may be

Equally important to the opt-out procedure or

19

the voluntary requirement is the fact that teachers now

20

instruct the students about mutual respect, respect of

21

other belief systems, of all persons' belief systems.

22

Third, I would like to go back to the issue that

23

was presented in this case, which was whether the school

24

district policy violates the Establishment Clause.

25

Respondent conceded at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the school district policy had a secular purpose.

2

There's nothing in the record to show that the school

3

district policy was adopted solely for religious purpose,

4

nor is there anything in the record that shows there was

5

any religious purpose in adopting, in adopting, the school

6

district policy.

7

Moreover, the Pledge of Allegiance in grammar

8

schools, in public schools, is part of a teaching program,

9

and that's what we're here about, to talk about the

10

educational upbringing of a child, and it has to do with

11

national unity and citizenship of our young students.

12

QUESTION: May I ask you just one question?

13

hate to take your rebuttal time, but one of the amicus

14

briefs filed in this case has this sentence in it. I'd

15

like you to comment on.

16

pledge is not intended as a serious affirmation of faith,

17

then every day government asks millions of school children

18

to take the name of the Lord in vain.

19

on that argument?

20

I

If the religious portion of the

Would you comment

MR. CASSIDY: I would disagree, because we feel

21

that the use of the term, one nation under God, reflects a

22

political philosophy, and the political philosophy of our

23

country, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence,

24

is one is -- that ours is one of a limited government, and

25

that is the philosophy that's now more enhanced, more

reflected in the 1954 act.
But back to our school district policy, which is

3

what is being challenged in this case, I would point the

4

Court to the joint appendix at page 149, which sets forth

5

not only that the pledge is recited in grammar school, but

6

also that the pledge is then -- also can be recited in

7

secondary schools, and likewise, that policy provides that

8

school children are to look at all the different

9

components of our history, speeches, historical documents,

10

whether they be state constitutions, the Declaration of

11

Independence, the Bill of Rights, and likewise, that's

12

incorporated into the history and social sciences content

13

standards for California, specifically at grade one level.

14

Not only are the students learning the Pledge of

15

Allegiance and singing songs such as My Country 'Tis of

16

Thee, but likewise they're learning about the Declaration

17

of Independence, so they are learning about our country's

18

nationalism and civic unity at a very early stage.

don't say the Pledge of Allegiance and go home.
