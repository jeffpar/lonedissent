ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL G. FRICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. FRICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In holding that Hernan O'Ryan Castro's first

12

titled 28 U.S.C., section 2255 petition was second or

13

successive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death

14

Penalty Act of 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals

15

has placed itself in conflict with every other court of

16

appeals circuit in the United States, save the Fifth, in

17

how they view or treat the impact of a prior post-

18

conviction motion which has been sua sponte re-

19

characterized or treated as a 2255 petition by the

20

district court.

21

QUESTION:

22

a judge-made thing?

23

provides for it, is there?

24
25

MR. FRICK:

Is recharacterization pretty much of
There's -- there's no statute that

That is absolutely correct.

judge-made -- it is a judge-made thing.

It is a

It is something

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that has been -- that has grown up among the courts in an

2

attempt to save what would otherwise be generally in the

3

case of a pro se prisoner, a facially deficient or an

4

ineptly pleaded document, and by recharacterizing it, it's

5

trying to take substance and putting into form so that the

6

court can actually rule on the substance of the particular

7

motion that was pleaded.

8
9
10

QUESTION:
two?

Well, what's the difference in the

I'm -- I'm the trial judge and I receive a motion

under rule 33 that's within the time limits under rule 33.

11

MR. FRICK:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FRICK:

Yes, Your Honor.
When do I recharacterize it?
Justice Kennedy, at the present time

14

recharacterization in our opinion should only be done at

15

such time as the court determines that there is absolutely

16

no viable way that it's going to be able to take the

17

document as pleaded under the title that it's given to the

18

court and effectuate a remedy therefrom.

19

Now, it is our contention that, as in the Adams

20

and Miller cases from the Second and Third Circuits, that

21

at the present time, under the restrictions of the AEDPA,

22

that a recharacterization should never take place by a

23

court unless there is concurrence on the part of the

24

petitioner himself and he's given the --

25

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I understand that -- that

argument of yours.

2

MR. FRICK:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But what I'm asking is what is --

4

what factors does the judge take into account or should

5

take into account when he or she is asked to

6

recharacterize the motion?

7

judge.

8

limits, and then the Government or -- says, now you should

9

recharacterize.

I -- I get -- I'm the trial

I get a rule 33 motion, which is within the time

What -- what are factors that I consider

10

when I recharacterize?

11

should never recharacterize unless you have to for some

12

reason?

13

MR. FRICK:

You -- you indicate that you

Yes, sir, and I do not believe that

14

it is the Government's part to ask the court to

15

recharacterize something.

16
17

QUESTION:

MR. FRICK:

19

QUESTION:

21

If

-- if I wanted to go look in -- in some manual or --

18

20

Is there any authority for that?

No, Your Honor.

There --

-- some practice book to know when I

can recharacterize, when I can't?
MR. FRICK:

No, Your Honor, but the D.C. Circuit

22

-- but first of all, all of the cases that we have cited

23

except for the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have

24

addressed issues, have addressed circumstances under which

25

recharacterization was done of certain motions that were

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pleaded in order to help ostensibly the individual who

2

pled the motion.

3

QUESTION:

But here the Government and the trial

4

court the first time around just said they would have no

5

objection, didn't they, having treated it as a 2254?

6

didn't urge that it be recharacterized, the rule 33

7

motion.

8
9

MR. FRICK:

They

No, they did not ask that it be

recharacterized, Your Honor.

What they said is that they

10

had no objection to it being considered as also seeking

11

relief under 2255.

12

presented to the court, unlike in virtually all of the

13

other cases in the other circuits -- and this is one of

14

the points that makes this such a strong case for Mr.

15

Castro -- his rule 33 motion was absolutely correct in all

16

respects insofar as seeking the remedy that he did.

17

But my client, Mr. Castro, had

The Eleventh Circuit's initial opinion in this

18

case, in fact, recognized the opinion that it later

19

vacated sua sponte -- actually recognized the fact that he

20

had brought a proper rule 33 motion under -- under Brady.

21

QUESTION:

And when you say a proper rule 33

22

motion, you don't necessarily mean one on which relief

23

will be granted I take it.

24
25

MR. FRICK:

No, Your Honor.

It is, nonetheless,

a motion that does not require recharacterization in order

MR. FRICK:

That's absolutely correct, Justice

10

Ginsburg, and the court -- the district court's order,

11

interestingly enough, starts out by saying we have before

12

us Hernan O'Ryan Castro's motion for a new trial under

13

rule 33, and then it ends in conclusion by stating for the

14

above reasons, we deny Hernan O'Ryan Castro's rule 33

motion for new trial.

opinion itself that there is reference to the Government

17

having requested that it also be considered as requesting

relief under 2255 and that they would, therefore, take

that consideration.

That's correct.

Not up until that

Castro get representation?

MR. FRICK:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FRICK:

13

QUESTION:

So throughout the original rule -Totally pro se.
And even when he -- his first styled

14

2255, he was still pro se until that one went up on

15

appeal.

16
17

MR. FRICK:
correct.

18
19

QUESTION:

22
23

And pro se, Castro filed an appeal

from the merits determination of the district court?

20
21

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's

MR. FRICK:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

But didn't raise, as an issue, the

treatment of his -- the recharacterization --

MR. FRICK:

That is correct.

MR. FRICK:

That was not raised -- that was not

raised as an issue by him at that point in time.

QUESTION:

MR. FRICK:

And what are we to make of that?
Your Honor, I would suggest that we

5

make nothing of it.

this places this case under one of three things.

particular things.

11

18

The Government has suggested that

At the time Mr. Castro appealed, had

At the time that he appealed?
Mm-hum.

We can find it out.

I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
But -We -- we have two or three different

appeals.
QUESTION:

I thought, frankly, that he had

appealed in March of 1996 and AEDPA was enacted in April.
MR. FRICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

At page 147 of the

22

joint appendix there's a March 19th, 1996 Eleventh Circuit

23

affirmance of the district court denial of the rule 33

24

motion for new trial, and in that order the court states

25

that this is an appeal from the denial of relief in regard

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to a combined motion to vacate, set aside, or correct

2

sentence, 2255, and motion for new trial.

3

Of course, it is our contention that that

4

statement is not actually accurate because there had never

5

been a motion filed by anyone seeking relief under 2255.

6

It had simply been a characterization.

7

QUESTION:

Now, that -- that would mean that

8

when the district court decided to treat this as being

9

under either or both of those provisions, it was doing him

10

no harm, AEDPA not yet being in existence.

11

MR. FRICK:

12

Your Honor.

13

standpoint --

14

Is that right?

I believe that that was the -- yes,

I believe that is -- that is correct from the

QUESTION:

It's only the subsequent enactment of

15

AEDPA that caused the recharacterization to be harmful to

16

him.

17

MR. FRICK:

Yes, Your Honor, and not only that,

18

but not only was this a pre-AEDPA filing of the rule 33

19

plus recharacterization at that time, it was a denial of

20

the -- that relief, that joint relief, pre-AEDPA.

21

QUESTION:

What do you make of the argument on

22

the other side that although, of course, there was no

23

AEDPA at that point, we did have a -- a structure of -- of

24

rules governing abuse of the writ and second and

25

successive petitions and that he would have -- he would

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have run afoul of those rules, or at least there was

2

reason to be concerned that he might run afoul of those

3

rules, and therefore, the enactment of AEDPA really

4

shouldn't make any difference in our analysis?

5

MR. FRICK:

Well, Your Honor, I -- the

6

Government's brief seems to pretty much equate abuse of

7

the writ with the restrictions placed under 2255.

8

QUESTION:

And I'll -- I'll stipulate here that

9

they're -- you know, they're not exactly identical.

10

the argument is your concern basically here with the

11

unfairness of tagging him with an earlier petition, and

12

it's unfair because of the -- the consequences under

13

AEDPA.

14

unfair or just as fair in the pre-AEDPA law.

15

fairness argument.

16

But

And they're saying it would have been just as
It's a

What do -- what do you say to that?

MR. FRICK:

Yes, sir.

I -- I believe that the

17

other circuits of this country, courts of appeals, have

18

addressed the difference between the abuse of the writ and

19

the impact of having filed an initial 2255 under AEDPA and

20

having that.

21
22
23

QUESTION:
What do you say?

Right.

What -- what do you say?

What's your answer to the Government?

MR. FRICK:

I say that there is a significant

24

difference as stated by those other circuits between the

25

difficulty in getting a second petition filed under abuse

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the writ.

2

petition filed.

3

It -- it wasn't as difficult to get a second

QUESTION:

Is -- is the -- is the basic

4

difference that you have to go to the court of appeals and

5

that's a tough standard, whereas under our prior law, you

6

-- you didn't have to go through that step?

7

MR. FRICK:

That would certainly be one of the

8

differences, Your Honor.

9

itself in Mr. Castro's case was not to his benefit.

But the recharacterization
There

10

-- there's no contention that the Government did it to

11

legally entrap him, but that's the circumstance that he

12

ultimately found himself in, having had the court

13

recharacterize it, so to speak.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't -- isn't there

15

another point that filing a legitimate -- maybe -- on the

16

merits motion for new trial on ground A and later -- and

17

-- and having it denied, then later filing a 2255 on

18

ground B under our abuse of the writ doctrine -- that

19

would not have been an abuse of the writ, would it?

20

MR. FRICK:

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

21

It's also important, I believe, to -- to consider that

22

while Mr. Castro was -- while Mr. Castro was pro se,

23

that's not -- that's not a critical element in connection

24

with this case.

25

attorneys representing him with a recharacterization

These same pitfalls would have befallen

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

problem as -- as it was done at that time, although I'm

2

not so sure that the Government would have suggested that

3

it would not object to it being recharacterized as a 2255

4

if there had been counsel on the other side at that time.

5

QUESTION:

But as far as raising a question on

6

appeal, it's more likely, if he had counsel, that the pro

7

se prisoner gets to see a document that starts out by

8

saying you made a rule 33 motion, and the bottom line is,

9

as you pointed out, your motion is denied, and that 2255

10

comes up only in the body of the opinion.

11

something that a lawyer is far more likely to spot than a

12

pro se prisoner who sees I made a motion under rule 33,

13

and the bottom line of this judgment is my motion is

14

denied.

15

MR. FRICK:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is

That's correct.

Would he have been able to appeal the

17

trial court's treatment of it as -- as under the habeas

18

provision?

19

the Government says it's law of the case because he should

20

have appealed it.

21

Would he have been able to appeal?

I mean,

He -- he was the --

MR. FRICK:

Your Honor, I don't know what point

22

he would have appealed.

23

consideration of the motion throughout the entire motion

24

used the analysis of -- of Brady and Giglio in reaching

25

the point that his motion for new trial should be denied.

The -- the district court's

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

There was one brief remark about 2255 and the

2

constitutional application in it, but it was not, in

3

effect, necessary to the decision that the court rendered.

4

And therefore, I do not believe that law of the case

5

applied.

6

QUESTION:

Well, even -- even if it wasn't

7

necessary, he would have had to go to appeal saying I

8

agree with the judgment below.

9

relief.

I should have been denied

But I want you to write an opinion saying that it

10

was wrong for the court to treat this -- I mean, the

11

normal appellate judge would say, look it, you know, you

12

have nothing to complain about if you agree that you

13

should have been denied relief under the other one.

14

MR. FRICK:

15

Your Honor, the -- the question presented before

Yes, Your Honor.

16

this Court is not quite as narrow in our view as looking

17

specifically at the facts of this case, with it being a

18

pre-AEDPA when most of the other circuit cases are post-

19

AEDPA, both in the recharacterization phase and in the

20

filing of a first titled 2255.

21

asked pertaining to this Court dealt with when a first

22

post-conviction motion is recharacterized sua sponte as a

23

2255, is a subsequent first titled 2255 rendered second or

24

successive under the AEDPA.

25

no in our opinion.

The question that we were

The -- the answer to that is

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But the significance and the point I wanted to

2

make there is that the Government's contention that we've

3

got a law of the case issue -- law of the case is very --

4

I'm not sure exactly what the law of the case is going to

5

ultimately result in other than the determination that

6

there had been a recharacterization sua sponte as a 2255.

7

And under that circumstance that's what we're here arguing

8

about.

9

QUESTION:

One thing you might touch on, Mr.

10

Frick, during the course, the Government contends we don't

11

have jurisdiction over this petition.

12

want to discuss that --

Perhaps you might

13

MR. FRICK:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FRICK:

16

Under Stillert -- excuse me -- Stewart v.

Yes.
-- at some point.
Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

17

Martinez-Villareal and Slack v. McDaniel, this Court has

18

already made the determination that it has jurisdiction to

19

consider and review a circuit court of appeals' decision

20

pertaining to whether or not a first titled 2255 is second

21

or successive following recharacterization.

22

cases dealt with that issue.

23

situations, but the bottom line was this Court took

24

jurisdiction under those cases to consider the issue of

25

successive or second petition under AEDPA.

Both of those

They were different fact

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In addition, a -- an actual look at the statute,

2

28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E), which is in the appendix of the

3

Government's brief, appendix 2a, that is the statute that

4

the Government contends shows that this Court does not

5

have jurisdiction.

6

with is a proscription against this Court having

7

jurisdiction when a court of appeals has granted or denied

8

a request for authorization for a district court to

9

consider a second or successive petition.

What that particular section deals

That is a

10

recognition on the part -- the statute recognizes that

11

there has been a first 2255 so characterized as such, so

12

pleaded as such by the petitioner, and that he has then

13

come before them with what he recognizes is a second

15

under AEDPA there are restrictions that we have not had

certain gatekeeping requirements in order for the district

recharacterization of his appeal into a request for

that scenario, 2244(b)(3)(E) should serve as a bar to

We strongly suggest, Your Honors, that that

The AEDPA and the -- changed jurisdiction.

The Government would have a

As I understand your position,

15

though, you don't even have to read strict construction.

16

You -- I think it's your view, isn't it, that subsection

17

(E) just doesn't speak to the question whether we have

18

jurisdiction over a decision by a court of appeals as to

19

whether or not a particular petition is second or

20

successive?

21

MR. FRICK:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I was

22

simply addressing the Government's position in trying to

23

craft a -- a way under 2244(b)(3)(E) to prevent this Court

24

from having jurisdiction of the matter.

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other courts of appeals have given the district court

instructions about how they should deal with cases of

recharacterization.

MR. FRICK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Those tests are not identical.

Of

8

approach?

9

MR. FRICK:

Your Honor, I believe that the --

10

the Second Circuit Adams case sets forth probably the best

11

bright line test, that being that the petitioner -- that

12

-- that when a court has a petition that it thinks would

13

better be served as recharacterized, that they should

14

inform the petitioner first that they believe it should be

15

recharacterized in order for them to grant relief, that it

16

should be recharacterized as a 2255, obtain the consent of

17

the petitioner, and if they don't obtain the consent of

18

the petitioner, then offer the petitioner the opportunity

19

to withdraw the petition and file it at a later point in

20

time, assuming that it can be refiled at some point in

21

time, and not be -- not run into problems with the statute

25

would appropriately be brought under a 2255 before they

where recharacterization does take place in spite of the

Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16

Very well, Mr. Frick.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the

18

court of appeals' decision because the court of appeals

19

denied authorization to file a second or successive 2255

20

motion.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

But that's only if you know that it's

a second or a successive petition.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Stevens, the

24

interpretive question we think that's presented, as far as

25

the jurisdictional issue goes, is whether a denial of

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

authorization is simply a finding that the gatekeeping

2

requirements have not been satisfied or rather whether it

3

encompasses both that determination and the subsidiary

4

determination that the motion is in fact second or

5

successive.

6

encompassing both.

7

It's our position that it is a single order

QUESTION:

Is -- is it your view that the Court

8

would never have jurisdiction to review a determination by

9

a court of appeals that a petition was or was not a second

10
11

or successive?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

No.

There -- there are two

12

circumstances when it can.

13

situation, and there this Court had jurisdiction because

14

the court of appeals found that the motion was not second

15

or successive and so didn't grant or deny authorization.

16

So it didn't fall within 2244(b)(3)(E).

17

One is the Martinez-Villareal

The second situation will be one where the court

18

of appeals finds that the motion is second or successive

19

and doesn't go on to reach --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

So our jurisdiction depends on how

the court of appeals resolved the issue.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right.

It depends upon,

23

as the statute makes clear, whether there was a grant or

24

denial of authorization.

25

QUESTION:

I don't understand your second

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

instance.

2
3

MR. HIMMELFARB:

The second instance -- let me

back up to try to answer that as clearly as I can.

4

The ordinary case where a court of appeals is

5

able to address the question whether the district court

6

properly found that a motion was second or successive is a

7

case where a motion for authorization to file the motion

8

is filed in a court of appeals.

9

circuits, once a district court finds that a motion is

That's because in many

10

second or successive, it's obligated to transfer the case

11

to the court of appeals so it can make the gatekeeping

12

determination.

13

is permitted to dismiss and does rather than transfer, and

14

once it's found that the motion is second or successive,

15

it's going to be a rare case where the defendant is able

16

to take an appeal from the dismissal because under this

17

Court's decision in Slack v. McDaniel, he'll only be able

18

to get a certificate of appealability if he makes two

19

showings:

20

second or successive is subject to debate among reasonable

21

jurists; and in addition to that, that there was some

22

underlying constitutional claim that has arguable merit.

23

And even in cases where a district court

first, that the procedural ruling that it was

So in a rare circumstance, when an appeal can be

24

taken on the issue of whether the motion is second or

25

successive, and in the rare circumstance where the court

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of appeals, after affirming that finding, does not go on

2

to reach the gatekeeping issue, as courts of appeals often

3

do just to bring the case to a close, that will be the

4

rare case where there has been a court of appeals' finding

5

that the motion is second or successive, but yet no grant

6

or denial such that 2244(b)(3)(E) does not deprive this

7

Court of jurisdiction.

8

That is not this case.

9

QUESTION:

So in any case, your view is no

10

matter how absurd, if a -- the court of appeals says a

11

60(b) motion is second or successive, if they say a

12

complaint in a 1983 action is a second or successive

13

habeas petition, no matter how absurd, once the court of

14

appeals says this is a second or successive application,

15

nobody has any right to appeal here, even though that

16

isn't what the statute says.

17

MR. HIMMELFARB:

So long as there is a grant or

18

denial of authorization, the court of appeals' decision

19

cannot be second-guessed.

20

QUESTION:

Now, why would we -- why would we

21

interpret a statute that doesn't say that to -- what it

22

says is, it says that they shall not file a second or

23

successive application, in other words, if it is a second

24

or successive application.

25

It doesn't tell us what to do if it isn't.

It doesn't say if it isn't.
So why would

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we adopt this interpretation that you say where the

2

statute doesn't say it, which would perhaps deprive people

3

of all kinds of right to petition the Supreme Court in

4

cases where they might be right?

5

MR. HIMMELFARB:

The interpretive question is

6

whether a denial of authorization under 2244(b)(3)(E) is

7

simply a finding that the gatekeeping requirements haven't

8

been satisfied or whether it's both that and the

9

subsidiary finding that the motion is second or

10

successive.

11

if the court of appeals finds the gatekeeping requirements

12

not satisfied and therefore denies authorization, and yet

13

manifestly errs in so finding, this Court would,

14

nevertheless, have jurisdiction to review it.

15

manifest error exception to 2244(b)(3)(E).

16

Nobody would take the position I think that

QUESTION:

There's no

Well, but that's -- you -- you call

17

it a subsidiary question, whether or not it's second or

18

successive.

19

first.

You want to reach the gatekeeping question

That's not the way the statute reads.

20

MR. HIMMELFARB:

21

QUESTION:

Well, we think it is.

And why isn't it -- why isn't it a

22

predicate?

23

or grant of an authorization by the court of appeals to

24

file what the court of appeals finds is a second or

25

successive petition, but that's not what the statute says.

You read the statute.

So it says the denial

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HIMMELFARB:

We think the statute does say

2

that, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons.

3

2244(b)(3)(E) speaks at -- speaks of a denial of

4

authorization.

5

a finding that the gatekeeping requirements had -- had not

6

been satisfied, it could have used narrower language, as

7

indeed it did in 2244(b)(3)(C) which refers specifically

8

to the gatekeeping requirements.

9

first textual indication that our position is correct.

10

The first is that

If Congress had intended that to mean only

We think that's the

The second textual indication is that in

11

2244(b)(3)(A) and (b)(3)(B), Congress speaks of an order

12

authorizing the district court to consider the

13

application.

14

granting or denying an authorization to be synonymous with

15

2244(b)(3)(E)'s reference to a grant or denial of

16

authorization.

17

We think it's reasonable to view an order

QUESTION:

Well, at the very least, if the

18

statute is ambiguous, it seems to me you have to answer

19

Justice Breyer's concern that an erroneous determination

20

here can foreclose the petitioner from exercising some

21

very important rights.

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Our view is that the statute is

23

not ambiguous.

24

statutory construction, the best reading of it is that

25

Congress intended to include the subsidiary determination

After applying all the relevant tools of

when it said that this Court may not review a denial of

2

authorization.

3

QUESTION:

Sometimes there might be a

4

constitutional question.

5

opinion appealed to this Court might be required as a

6

matter of due process and what the lower court does, the

7

court of appeals -- it -- it erroneously characterizes

8

that effort to come to the -- that effort to appeal, which

9

the Constitution would protect.

I mean, where for example an

characterizes it as a second or successive petition, and

in your view Congress would have just said, even however

12

erroneous it is, it can't come here.

13

the constitutional requirement?

14

MR. HIMMELFARB:

What do we do about

Well, Justice Breyer, you could

15

imagine a case where there is a very serious

16

constitutional claim raised, but there's absolutely no

17

dispute that it's being raised in a second or successive

18

motion, and the defendant can't satisfy at the substantive

19

gatekeeping requirements.

20

second or successive.

21

requirements.

22

anyone would take the view that under 2244(b)(3)(E) that

23

defendant would, nevertheless, be able to seek certiorari

24

from this Court.

25

to give the court of appeals the final say.

The court of appeals says it's

You don't satisfy the gatekeeping

We deny authorization.

I don't think

So the whole point of 2244(b)(3)(E) is

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

QUESTION:

And one final thing.

You realize the

2

language, of course, says that you cannot ask for cert

3

from the denial of an authorization by a court of appeals

4

to file a second or successive application.

5

opponents are saying we're not appealing the denial of the

6

request to file a second or successive application.

7

are appealing the determination that this is a second or

8

successive application, a matter that the statute is

9

silent about.

10

MR. HIMMELFARB:

And your

is the court of appeals' decision, which is a single

order, which does two things.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, it's -- as -- as I've

2

said, the ordinary way that a defendant is able to

challenge a district court's determination that his motion

is second or successive in the court of appeals is not via

But, of course, he didn't file an

authorization motion in this case.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's true.

That brings me to

13

my second point.

14

rare case where a defendant is able to take an appeal from

15

a dismissal of a motion as second or successive, after the

16

court of appeals affirms the finding that the motion is

17

second or successive, it will often go on to treat the

18

appeal as an implied request for authorization to file the

19

motion because otherwise you've got a lingering question

20

of whether this motion found to be second or successive

21

can or cannot be filed, and it will reach that question

22

just to bring the matter to a close.

23

In many cases within the category of the

It's our position, of course, that if the Court

QUESTION:

The characterization

Well, this -- this business of having

5

a court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a

6

doctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA

7

was enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of

8

AEDPA have decided that if they're going -- if the

9

district court is going to do that, that some notice

10

should be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about

11

the consequences of that recharacterization.

interpret the words, second or successive petition, in

Our view is that the First

Circuit's view, which does not require notice but simply

says that if there is no notice, the second motion is

deemed to be a first motion, should not be adopted because

20

we think it's inconsistent with the basic principle of

post-conviction litigation, which we're urging this Court

to adopt in this case, that you have to file your

litigation, it is appropriate, once you've got the judge-

further and say, before you do, notice has to be given.

8

QUESTION:

We think, as a matter of

Wouldn't it -- wouldn't it be much

10

simpler just to say if a district court recharacterizes,

11

it must do this without going into when or why you should

12

recharacterize?

13

MR. HIMMELFARB:

It probably -- I think it

14

would, Mr. Chief Justice.

Our only point is that if

15

there's going to be a recharacterization and there's going

16

to be notice, the only notice should be I plan to

17

recharacterize.

18

should give any kinds of warnings about the consequences

of recharacterization for the reasons I gave Justice

think most of the courts of appeals take the view that you

should not only give notice of the intent to

9

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Our view is that giving notice

of an intent to recharacterize puts the defendant in the

10
11

same position as one who filed a self-styled 2255, and

12

under the law of post-conviction litigation, such a

13

defendant is held responsible for the consequences of

14

filing that motion.

15

QUESTION:

That's not the position that any of

the circuits have taken.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think that -- I think that's

probably right.

require notice, within that notice, they think there

20

should be some warning about the consequences of

21

characterization.

22

with the fact that there's a detailed procedural scheme

governing post-conviction motions and Congress said

24

nothing about warnings as it did, for example, in the

QUESTION:

Isn't there a difference between a

case in which a litigant makes up his mind to file a 2255

-- presumably he should have found out what's the

consequence of that -- and the situation in which he files

How does he know what the consequences are if he hasn't

had a chance to think it through?

10

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Stevens, the way we

envision the regime working is that the motion is filed
and the district court issues an order which it serves on

11
12

parties, giving notice that it intends to recharacterize

13

and some amount of time will elapse before the defendant

14

is obligated to come back to the court and tell the court

15

whether it wishes for the court to go forward with

16

recharacterization or allow him to withdraw.

17

that period of --

18

QUESTION:

So within

But you would say the

19

-- I have with your argument is that when the district --

4

your argument to the effect that no notice of consequence

will take place.

does that, the court is understood to be trying to help

out the defendant.

those words or not, that's -- that's the object.

12

14

and -- and I'm going to recharacterize this as under 2255.
It seems very odd for the court, in effect, to

15

be in the position of saying, I'm going to help you out by

16

recharacterizing and at the same time keep its mouth shut

17

about the fact that when it does recharacterize, the

18

consequence is going to be that that fellow is going to be

19

out on his ear if he ever wants to walk in with another

20

claim that could have been made under 2255.

21

me that if courts are going to help, they've got to help
