CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

5

Alvarez-Machain, and the United States v. the same.

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER THE UNITED STATES

9
10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit found that the arrest at issue

12

here was one unauthorized, false, and in violation of

13

international law because it occurred in Mexico.

14

Nonetheless, the court found inapplicable the exception in

15

the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising in a

16

foreign country.

17

At the same time, the court read the bare

18

jurisdictional terms of section 1350 in title 28 to

19

provide courts with the authority to infer causes of

20

action from sources of customary international law,

21

including treaties that the political branches have

22

expressly refused to ratify.

23

The resulting decision, which reads express

24

grants of executive authority narrowly and implied grants

25

of judicial authority broadly, turns the established

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

separation of powers regime for dealing with international

2

issues on its head.

3

The Ninth Circuit first construed executive

4

authority narrowly by holding that the DEA agents lacked

5

the authority to effect an arrest in Mexico or abroad.

6

That decision -- that holding has several problems, not

7

the least of which is that by its terms it would preclude

8

Federal agents from making an arrest abroad even in

9

circumstances where the foreign country consents or there

10

is no foreign government that is functioning to provide

11

consent.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, you -- you have a number

13

of strings to your bow.

14

important than the others?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

QUESTION:

Is -- is one of them more

Well, regrettably -­

I mean, it -- it's unlikely that

17

we're going to go through the whole list of your -- your

18

reasons for reversing here and say you're right on every

19

one.

20

that is more important to the Government than the others?

21

If we -- if we pick one, is there one that is -­

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, regrettably, Justice Scalia,

22

this is the rare case where I think they really are of

23

quite significance because what the Ninth Circuit has held

24

is, on the one hand, Federal agents, including the FBI,

25

would lack the authority to make arrests abroad.

They've

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

also ruled in a way that I think really reads the foreign

2

country exemption out of the Federal Tort Claims Act and

3

then, of course, on the 1350 issue, that is an issue of

4

tremendous importance to the Government and also to the

5

broader community.

6

QUESTION:

So I guess if -­
That's not your -- you're just

7

arguing the Federal Tort Claims Act first.

Is that -- in

8

-- in this argument that we're hearing now, we're dealing

9

with the Federal Tort Claims Act and not 1350?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

both in -- in my initial period.

12

going to be covering just 1350 because that's the only

13

issue that affects his client.

14

both the petitioner in the case that raises the Federal

15

Tort Claims Act issue, but also a respondent in support of

16

petitioner with respect to 1350.

17

goal in -- in 25 minutes, but I hope to address them both.

18

QUESTION:

I actually intend to cover them
Now, Mr. Phillips is

But the United States is

So it's an ambitious

Well, getting back to Justice

19

Scalia's question, I -- I suppose the President or the

20

Attorney General could make an order with respect to

21

extraterritorial arrests, and that would eliminate one

22

rationale of the court of appeals.

23

that?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Or am I wrong about

Well, I think you are wrong about

that, Justice Kennedy, because as I read the ruling of the

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Ninth Circuit, they say that the President, the executive,

2

the Attorney General lack the authority to make an

3

extraterritorial arrest, and they specifically -­

4
5

QUESTION:

I guess you would have to get to that

issue first.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

That's right.

Now, I think -­

And they said even if it had the

authority, it -- it has to be from a high official.
MR. CLEMENT:

That actually wasn't the -- the

10

reasoning of the majority opinion.

There's a concurrence

11

by, I think, five of the six justices in the majority that

12

said at a minimum you'd need a high-ranking official, but

13

the majority opinion that's the law of the Ninth Circuit

14

is that regardless of who approves the operation, the

15

President categorically lacks that authority.

16

of course, the -­

And that's,

17

QUESTION:

Were -- were the majority -­

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, may I ask you?

Is -- am

19

I correct in thinking if we agree with you on -- on that

20

issue, that disposes of the entire case?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I think that's correct,

22

Justice Stevens.

Now, I would say that it -- the other

23

issues in the case are logically in some respects anterior

24

to that question, especially because the -- for example,

25

the section 1350 really is a question about the -- the

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

very jurisdiction of the courts.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but you certainly don't have to

3

address that if you think they're wrong as a statutory

4

matter, that there -- there, in fact, was no arbitrary

5

arrest here.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

That's exactly right, Justice

7

O'Connor.

8

address those other issues.

9

There's no way I can tell you that you have to

QUESTION:

10

No, no.

MR. CLEMENT:

I think, though, there's nothing

11

that would stop the Court from addressing those issues,

12

and those -­

13

QUESTION:

Well, we'd have to be pretty

14

ambitious because some of them weren't addressed below and

15

they're contrary -- the position being taken today is

16

contrary to the position taken by previous Solicitors

17

General.

18

sure it was even raised and argued below.

19

I mean, it's kind of a new question.

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not

Well, we think it was raised and

20

argued below, Justice O'Connor, and I think the 1350 issue

21

is of tremendous continuing importance.

22

I mean, if I could -- if I could address the

23

point that you raised about the change in position.

It is

24

true that the United States in the Filartiga case took a

25

different position.

Now, subsequent that -- to that, the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

administration has -- different administrations have taken

2

the position that 1350 is just jurisdictional.

3

And if I could draw an analogy to the experience

4

that this Court has had, in 1947 this Court upheld the

5

constitutionality of State statutes that provided

6

reciprocity in inheritance laws with foreign countries and

7

said that was okay.

8

benefit of hindsight and the experience with State court

9

judges causing foreign policy problems, this Court in the

21 years later, with the -- sort of

10

Journing case revisited that decision.

11

way, I think the 20-years-plus experience that we've had

12

with the Filartiga regime has made it quite clear that

13

these lawsuits provide tremendous problems for the foreign

14

policy interests of the United States.

15

And in a similar

And at the same time, in the intervening -­

16

intervening period, if anything, this Court has made it

17

quite clear what the proper mode of finding a cause of

18

action is and the proper way to read a jurisdictional

19

provision.

20

QUESTION:

As to your first, the tremendous

21

problems, how many lawsuits are there of this 1350 nature

22

and how many have even gone to judgment?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24

don't have the numbers on those.

25

Justice Ginsburg, regrettably, I

But I think one thing that's important to

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

emphasize is that the case doesn't have to go to judgment

2

to create potential foreign policy problems for the United

3

States.

4

litigation that's ongoing -- hasn't gone to judgment.

5

It's quite preliminary -- in New York right now, where

6

people are seeking compensation for abuses that occurred

7

during the apartheid regime in South Africa.

8

Government of South Africa itself, of course, has a very

9

different mechanism for dealing with those issues, the

10
11

And to give you just one example, there's

Now, the

truth and reconciliation process.
And the Government of South Africa has formally

12

protested at the highest levels that these issues that are

13

very difficult issues for that government and that

14

government is dealing with are the subject of litigation

15

in the United States courts.

16

time and time again you have private litigants that may be

17

very well intentioned but are focused on only a single

18

issue and they are bringing that issue into the courts,

19

creating foreign policy problems for the executive branch

20

which the executive branch then has to try to remedy and

21

ameliorate.

22

And I think what you see is

At the same time, in the process of those

23

lawsuits, you have courts making pronouncements on

24

principles of international law and customary

25

international law that may well be at variance with the

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

views of the executive branch or -­

2

QUESTION:

Has Congress been asked to take a

3

look at the statute and to amend it or -- or restrict it

4

in some fashion, 1350?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

6

been -­

7
8
9

I'm sure there have certainly

QUESTION:

Are there bills introduced to do

that?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't know that any bills are

10

pending, but I do think that Congress is certainly fully

11

able to deal with this situation.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I think so.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Definitely, and -- and -- but I

15

think when Congress does deal with this situation and

16

actually provides for a cause of action, that provides a

17

much better solution to this problem.

18

could point to the Torture Victim Protection Act as an

19

example of what happened -­

And I think if I

20

QUESTION:

That's all -- that's a good example

21

of where Congress took action.

22

isn't wise to look at the underlying statutory grounds

23

relied upon by the Ninth Circuit and deal with it that way

24

and let Congress have a look at this thing.

25

Congress would be interested in the views of the Attorney

I -- I just wonder if it

And I'm sure

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

General and others who think it's a concern.
MR. CLEMENT:

Again, Justice O'Connor, I mean, I

3

can only repeat that there's nothing that would stop this

4

Court from resting its decision only on the

5

extraterritorial authority question and that would

6

certainly be a significant correction of the law because

7

the Ninth Circuit has left us -­

8
9

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Clement, on that -- on that

point, your point that there must be another Federal

10

statute enacted creating a cause of action, because this

11

is purely jurisdictional, I have yet to find any judge

12

who's taken that position.

13

that position.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Even Judge Bork doesn't take

Well, I think that -- that -- I

15

don't know that Judge Randolph in his separate opinion in

16

the Al-Odah case expressly -- if you can tell exactly

17

where he would come down on that.

18

his opinion as consistent with the position we're urging,

19

but I of course may have an interest in doing so.

20

I -- I actually read

I would say this, though, that I think that if

21

you read this Court's precedents for dealing with a cause

22

of action -- in finding a cause of action, there's no

23

question that the 1350 is applied pursuant to those modern

24

principles -­

25

QUESTION:

Well, I understand all the cases

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

since Cort against Ash support you, but we're construing a

2

statute enacted a long, long time ago, and there was all

3

sorts of -- of opinion to the effect that there were at

4

least two or three causes of action that did not need to

5

be severally created:

6

and so forth.

7

Bork recognized.

8

position is -- is totally unsupported by judicial opinion.

9

privacy, protecting ambassadors,

You remember the three examples even Judge
If that's right, then your fundamental

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, with respect, Justice

10

Stevens, let me take that in a couple of steps.

11

all, I mean, certainly Judge Bork thought that maybe those

12

original causes of action would be actionable in Federal

13

court at the time.

14

First of

Now, first of all, to make clear, what the first

15

Congress did is rather than pass any kind of tort action,

16

it dealt with those three very offenses against the law of

17

nations and dealt with them criminally.

18

that what Judge Bork had in mind is that at the time of

19

the framing, as a matter of general common law in the pre­

20

Erie sense, it might have been possible to get into

21

Federal court and raise those three violations against the

22

law of nations as a tort action.

23

that authority would survive Erie in any event, and I

24

think it raises some questions of its own.

25

Now, it may be

I don't think, however,

Now, I think you're absolutely right, though,

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Stevens, to say that the one objection you would

2

have to applying straightforwardly the principles that

3

this Court has adopted in cases like Cort against Ash and

4

Sandoval is that this statute was passed at a much earlier

5

time and where the -- the enacting Congress may have had

6

different assumptions in mind.

7

But this Court has made clear that it's not

8

going to sort of tether its analysis to what assumptions

9

the enacting Congress might have had in mind.

It did so,

10

of course, in the Sandoval decision.

11

yourself, Justice Stevens, in your separate opinion in

12

California against Sierra Club where you said that it may

13

very well have been that the Congress in 1890 that passed

14

the Rivers and Harbor Act probably assumed there would be

15

a cause of action in court, but you said it was more

16

important to apply the principles of Cort against Ash in

17

that case than to try to divine the intent of an enacting

18

Congress from 100 years earlier.

19

QUESTION:

But you did so

Well, what about the cues that you

20

get from the Torture Victim Protection Act?

When Congress

21

had 1350 right next to it and there's not a word in -- in

22

that legislative history, it -- it seems to be a model.

23

Yes, this is a good thing, but it's -- it's -- we want to

24

make it really clear that torture is a crime against

25

humanity and we want to include U.S. citizens as

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

plaintiffs as well.

2

questioning 1350.

3

But they didn't say anything

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I could

4

just make sure that there's one fact that's on the table,

5

which is you said that they -- that Congress effectively

6

had the provisions side by side, and I think it is worth

7

noting that although the Torture Victim Protection Act is

8

now codified as a note to 1350, that was not a decision

9

Congress made.

That was just a codification decision.

10

Congress itself didn't say insert in the code after

11

1350 -­

12
13
14

QUESTION:

So

But there was discussion of 1350 by

the proponents of the Torture Victim Protection Act.
MR. CLEMENT:

There certainly was and I think

15

that -- that basically the enactment of Congress is -­

16

sort of says nothing about 1350 one way or another.

17

I would point to the Torture Victim Protection Act,

18

though, is a model of why it makes sense to ask Congress

19

to get involved in creating a cause of action because when

20

it does, it provides clear direction to the court and also

21

acts in a way that minimizes tensions with allies because

22

you're absolutely right to suggest that torture is one of

23

the most well-established norms of international law.

24

Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress addressed the

25

issue in the TVPA, it provided specific definitions of the

What

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prohibited conduct.

2

to the lower courts by providing for a specific statute of

3

limitations of 10 years.

4

Then it also provided clear guidance

And then, as I also indicated, it -- it put in a

5

specific statutory exhaustion provision which suggested

6

that litigants shouldn't rush to United States courts if

7

the courts in the area where the events actually took

8

place are open for the claims.

9

provision is particularly telling because it shows that

10

when you take the normal course and insist that Congress

11

get involved in the process of creating causes of action,

12

Congress as a political branch with foreign affairs

13

responsibilities of its own -­

14

QUESTION:

I think that last

But, Mr. Clement, if I -- if I

15

remember, some of the briefs have taken the position that

16

that's already an aspect of international law, a

17

requirement that you should first exhaust in the country

18

where the conduct took place, which would -- would narrow

19

the scope of the statute if we -- if we adopted that view.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, there

21

certainly are international jurists that will argue that

22

exhaustion principles are a principle of international

23

law.

24

you leave these issues to the courts and don't insist on a

25

cause of action is you leave the courts as a matter of

But I think that's exactly what ends up happening if

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal common law, I guess, trying to interpret

2

international law sources to come up with things like

3

exhaustion.

4

be even more difficult.

5

they're supposed to do all of that as a matter of Federal

6

common lawmaking with the only guide they have in the text

7

is the 33 words in 28 U.S.C. 1350 which, by their terms,

8

really only address jurisdiction.

9

put the courts in a very difficult position, and I think

10

in contrast, the Torture Victim Protection Act shows the

11

virtues of waiting for Congress to take some action before

12

somebody would get involved in this kind of situation.

A statute of limitations I would think would
Principles of damages.

And

So I think that would

13

QUESTION:

But in the -- in the --

14

QUESTION:

-- on 1350 address the question of

15

the authority of the DEA agents to make the address, and

16

if you have time, the Federal Tort Claims provision that

17

it's governed by events that occur abroad as opposed to

18

the headquarters doctrine.

19
20
21

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, and thank

you.
Let me start with the -- the arrest authority

22

question because, as I said at the outset, the view of the

23

Ninth Circuit is that there is categorically no arrest

24

authority abroad, even if a foreign nation consents.

25

that really cannot be correct.

And

And I think respondent

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

recognizes that implicitly by not defending that aspect of

2

the Ninth Circuit ruling, but rather insisting on a rule

3

that would give arrest authority only with consent.

4

And with respect, though, I think that is not a

5

workable rule for the Federal courts, and if I could use,

6

by way of example, the arrest of the individual who's the

7

convicted killer in the CIA shootings, Mir Aimal Kasi.

8

This is an individual who was arrested by FBI agents in

9

Pakistan in 1997.

Under the Ninth Circuit's approach,

10

obviously, this individual could not be arrested by FBI

11

agents as a categorical matter.

12

respondent, the Federal courts would have to inquire into

13

the circumstances surrounding the arrest and to inquire

14

specifically into whether the Government of Pakistan

15

consented to the arrest by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997.

16

But under the approach of

Now, I think the prospects for interfering with

17

sensitive diplomatic relations, not to mention the

18

difficulty of divining any principles for discerning the

19

requisite degree of consent, are manifest in both those

20

cases, and I would suggest that the far better approach is

21

to read section 878 of title 21, consistent with its plain

22

terms, to give the DEA the arrest authority for any felony

23

cognizable under the laws of the United States without

24

reading in either a territorial limitation or a limitation

25

based on consent.

QUESTION:

Doesn't the Mansfield Amendment tug

2

the other way?

3

they restricted DEA agents' authority, not granted it.

4

That was -- when Congress looked at this,

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I

5

actually think the Mansfield Amendment supports the view

6

of the United States here, and indeed, under the view of

7

the Ninth Circuit, it's entirely unclear what the

8

Mansfield Amendment was supposed to accomplish.

9

under their view limiting an authority that did not exist

10

because what the Mansfield Amendment does is put specific

11

limitations on the authority of Federal agents.

12

applies only to direct arrests, only to foreign police

13

actions, and only in the context of narcotics control

14

efforts.

15

exceptions for exigencies and the like.

16

what that reflects is that there may be circumstances

17

where an extraterritorial arrest authority raises concerns

18

and Congress may react to those, as it did in the

19

Mansfield Amendment, but the very fact that there is this

20

specific and tailored limitation on DEA authority suggests

21

that there must be some broader grant of authority that

22

includes extraterritorial arrests.

23

It was

It

And then even there it provides specific

QUESTION:

And so I think

But isn't -- isn't it possible to

24

read -- and I'm not sure it should be read this way, but

25

isn't it possible to read the Mansfield Amendment as

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

simply saying DEA agents should not go out in foreign

2

police raids when the police of the foreign countries make

3

the raids.

4

the foreign police action qualification.

5

Stay out of it.

MR. CLEMENT:

That's one way to read the -­

That's certainly -- that is one

6

way you could read it, Justice Souter.

7

there's two implications from that.

8

that's the way you read it, the Mansfield Amendment

9

certainly doesn't bar the action here.

10

QUESTION:

11

anything one way or the other.

12

And I think

One is, of course, if

It doesn't -- but it doesn't imply

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

But here's why I think it

13

still implies something about the scope of section 878

14

because section 878 of title 21 is not just the authority

15

for the DEA to make arrests, it's basically the source of

16

all their statutory authority for law enforcement efforts.

17

And I think that even participation in the midst of a

18

foreign police action, as you were envisioning the

19

reference in the Mansfield Amendment, is at least a law

20

enforcement involvement of the DEA.

21

unless 878 authorizes extraterritorial actions by DEA

22

agents, be it arrests, be it simply carrying a firearm, or

23

be it engaging in other investigatory activities, then so

24

too I think the language of the Mansfield Amendment, even

25

if it limits the very specific kind of law enforcement

And so I think that

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

activity by the DEA, still suggests that 878 by its terms

2

is not strictly limited to the territory of the United

3

States.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Of course, you get there by assuming

that anything that the DEA does is law enforcement.
MR. CLEMENT:

That's a fair point, but I think

7

even if that's a bit of a broad conception, I certainly

8

think assisting in the context of a foreign police action

9

should qualify as law enforcement.

10

If I could say just a -- a few things about the

11

foreign country exemption before I sit down.

I think that

12

there is a very clear error in the analysis of the Ninth

13

Circuit because this is really a -- a rare case where you

14

have an arrest that is false and tortious only because it

15

occurred in Mexico.

16

that the plaintiff is entitled to damages only for the

17

period he was in Mexico, and every element of the tort

18

took place in Mexico.

19

applies this headquarters doctrine to say that the foreign

20

country exception applies.

You have the lower courts recognizing

Yet, nonetheless, somehow the court

21

And I think what that illustrates is that

22

although the headquarters exception may have been a

23

helpful gloss on the language of the statute when it was

24

first developed, as it's been interpreted by the Ninth

25

Circuit, it becomes a free-floating exception to the -- to

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the foreign country exception that allows a plaintiff to

2

skirt the language of the statute simply by alleging any

3

degree of U.S. involvement or direction.

4
5

If I could reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

I guess I'd like to begin, Justice O'Connor,

13

with your question about whether or not this is an issue

14

that the Court ought to -- the -- the underlying question

15

of the meaning of the section 1350 is an issue the Court

16

ought to resolve as opposed to the narrower -­

17

QUESTION:

Or whether we have to.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, you clearly don't have to,

19

and -- and certainly Jose Francisco Sosa would be

20

perfectly content to have the judgment of the court of

21

appeals reversed on the ground that the arrest here was

22

neither arbitrary nor the detention prolonged in a way

23

that would no -- under no circumstances violate the law of

24

nations.

25

But the truth is, as one of the amicus briefs

cases that they cite in their briefs that have been filed

5

significant reason I think for this Court to try to

6

provide some additional guidance to the lower courts with

respect to the meaning of section 1350, particularly when

8

your -- your point brings to mind, frankly, Justice

22

Frankfurter's observations in the Romero case about

23

comparing the historical efforts here to archaeology and

24

the -- and as one who has now spent the better part of the

25

last 6 months on what struck me as a historical dig that

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

accumulated a whole lot of information, virtually none of

3

the Congress of 1789 really had in mind at the end of the

I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor.

are not matters of private concern.

interesting gap in that history because you go up till

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

It was pretty clearly, it seems to

me, one of the things that the statute would have covered

14

for the assault of the French ambassador.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's not -- well, it's not 100

16

percent clear to me because the -- the problem you have

17

there is that it would clearly have been a public right

18

and it was -- and, you know, the Congress in 1790

immediately passes a statute that -- that imposes criminal

sanction for this.

of quotations along those lines.
So if in fact that was so then and you're

looking for a modern counterpart, what's wrong with what

14

the European Commission said?

15

your views on that brief.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'd be interested in having

Well, let -- let me answer the

17

first question because the difference between

18

incorporating the law of nations from the -- into

19

admiralty jurisdiction, it had a tradition of 1,000 years.

20

The idea of interpreting the law of nations or

21

incorporating the law of nations into section 1350 or its

22

precursor back then where it only benefits aliens seems to

23

me a quite improbable undertaking by Congress in 1789.

24
25

QUESTION:

It would not be improbable in a world

where law was a brooding omnipresence in the sky to think

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

that we preserve it in the case of admiralty, maritime,

and certain instances of international law.

sends it to the states once they decide to make that

4

separation.

an idea in the minds of Congress.

ex ante thinking, of course, this is international, as

7

they thought maritime law was, then our task is to try to

translate that into modern terms.

to the European Commission.

10

That's an ex post event.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Erie

That doesn't cast

So if you have Congress

And that brings me back

But I -- I -- the difficulty I

14

and say, of course, if Congress preempts the field, as

15

maybe it did with torture, that's out.

implicitly is hostile to the cause of action, that's out.

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

O'Connor's question which is, could you resolve this

particular case by reference to an understanding of the

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

you're in that world and you're looking at those -- at

those circumstances, you obviously would have to take a

4

very narrow approach in -- in terms of trying to -­

5

QUESTION:

And presumably if there is some cause

of action alleged in any of these actions that have been

or might be filed, that deal with something that is

8

covered basically by a treaty that Congress has said is

9

non-self-executing, I assume that would displace any

10
11

common law background.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think that you raise an

12

important point there which is the parallelism between the

13

treaty prong and the law of nations prong of the statute

14

because if, as -- as Judge Bork explained in his separate

15

opinion, the thing that disturbed him the most about this

16

was the suggestion that somehow on behalf of aliens, you

17

would create a right under the treaty that you would -­

18

that -- that citizens would never have had the right to

19

because it wouldn't be self-executing.

20

improbable that Congress would have intended that.

21

parity of reasoning, why would Congress have wanted to

22

create this kind of access into a brooding omnipresence of

23

law that is essentially very difficult to confine?

24
25

It seemed quite
So by

And I -- and I go back to Justice Breyer's point
which is, to be sure, there are ways to try to narrow

1

those rules.

2

go down that path in the first place.

3

to recognize that this is a purely jurisdictional statute

4

and thereby force Congress to look in the future at

5

statutes like the Torture Victim Protection Act.

6

My position is you do better not to try to

QUESTION:

Okay.

You would do better

Mr. Phillips, let's -- let's

7

assume I accept your argument that there are good reasons

not to invite the -- the -- today's brooding omnipresence

into court without something more from Congress, that

10

there are good reasons to be concerned about separation of

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I don't know that it's

the only way, but it is the simplest way to get to that

10

kind of consistency if you accept the premise that

11

Congress necessarily believed in 1789 that there would be

MR. PHILLIPS:

But -- but -- the -- the -- I -­

10

I think there are no causes of action because the -- if

11

you take seriously -- why -- why would the Continental

12

Congress say to the States, enact a statute to protect

13

ambassadors if ambassadors are otherwise being protected?

14

Why does Connecticut then go forward and enact a law that

15

not only provides criminal protection for the ambassadors

16

but goes -- goes beyond that and provides civil remedies,

17

liability and damages for attacks on ambassadors, if there

18

is this brooding omnipresence?

19

The point is -- my -- my basic point is I don't

20

think the historical record will demonstrate to you at all

21

that these causes of action existed.

22

is not a simple instance of the courts -- of the Congress

23

trying to tap in to a body of law.

And therefore, this

What it was doing was

In that sense, I don't think the Congress of 1789

But the reality is you -- you create the

8

has got a -- you know, an obviously long line of -- of

9

opinions in which it's recognized jurisdiction doesn't

10

create Federal common law rules, jurisdiction doesn't

11

create a right of action.

12

And if this Court goes back to that core principle as the

13

method for trying to interpret section 1350, it will avoid

14

all of the problems and then force Congress to take the

15

action that I think is important here.

16

And this Court

It simply creates jurisdiction.

The -- the Torture Victim Protection Act has a

17

statute of limitations, has an exhaustion requirement, has

18

a definition of torture.

under international agreements dealing with the question

21

of torture.

Congress wasn't implementing

It was implementing its obligations

22

My guess is we have similar kinds of provisions

23

that are out there that we probably ought to be trying to

24

find causes of action for, and Congress should take those

25

up.

But what shouldn't happen is to allow the courts

2

common law power to go out, find causes of action, and

3

then proceed to define all of their elements, all of their

4

defenses without the benefit of any guidance, which is

5

precisely how you end up in a situation today where the

6

Ninth Circuit has said that in a situation where a Mexican

7

national assists the United States to -- to enforce an

8

arrest warrant, and the circumstances presented in this

9

case that he's not only engaged in an arbitrary act, but

10

that the detention is -- is wrongful in its own right, not

11

-- even though there's not a shred of evidence that the

12

United States would have embraced that view with respect

13

to its own obligations as a matter of international law.

Once you open this door -­

MR. PHILLIPS:

And you should deal with that

issue, but -- but, Justice O'Connor, I think you should

18

try to deal with the broader issue because there are just

19

too many of these cases out there creating too much havoc

20

for no good reason, if I'm right, that the Congress in

21

1789 did not have in mind something anywhere -- anything

22

like what we've seen since 1982.

23

for this Court then to go back to first principles of

24

statutory interpretation based on the language of the

25

statute and say enough is enough.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Let me start with the meaning of the alien tort

7

statute.

It's our position, as you know from the briefs,

8

that -- that Congress meant what it said, that Congress

9

actually decided in 1789 to pass a statute that allowed

10

aliens that had tort claims that -- involving the

11

violation of the law of nations to bring them in Federal

12

court, and that by using the word tort, what the -- the

13

Founding Fathers were referring to was a body of common

14

law that was well known to be part of the law in the

15

United States during the colonial days and at that time.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask -- may I ask this question

as a matter of history because your right on the point

21

now?

22

even the slightest suggestion that Congress wanted to

23

legislate with respect to anything that did not happen in

24

the United States or on the high seas?

25

Is there anything in the early history that gives

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think that the -- the

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

kinds of law of -- law of nations violations at the time

2

would have included piracy, which clearly -- in terms of

3

another country, I mean, it's certainly possible that a -­

4

an assault on an ambassador could have taken place in

5

another country.

6
7
8

QUESTION:

Yes, but the only ones they knew

about had taken place in the United States.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the ones that they were most

9

concerned about was the 1784 Marbois incident and the one

10

in 1788, the Dutch ambassador in New York City, were the

11

ones most on their mind.

12

QUESTION:

They certainly would not have been

13

concerned about an assault on the -- say, the English

14

ambassador in Paris by a Frenchman.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, that's not entirely clear, I

16

mean, because if there was a -- one of the things that was

17

before them was the transitory tort doctrine.

18

transitory tort doctrine, which this Court has recognized

19

dates back at least as -- as far as Mostyn v. Fabrigas,

20

which is a 1774 Lord Mansfield opinion, which involves

21

ironically a false imprisonment claim against a government

22

official which took place outside the territory of England

23

and which was found to be cognizable in common law tort

24

within the -- the courts of England.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

Excuse me?

You -- you don't need the law of

nations to sue on a transitory tort.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

I mean, if it's

No, of course, not.

If it was a tort in the country where

it was committed, you -- you could sue on it elsewhere.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

And in fact, I think that one

10

of the main purposes of the alien tort statute was to

11

provide a Federal forum for those claims when they came

12

within the United States.

13

QUESTION:

If -- if there was this background of

14

-- of understood common law that you say, how do you

15

explain the 1781 action of the Continental Congress which

16

is concerned about the fact that -- that there's no

17

redress for -- for assault on ambassadors, among other

18

things?

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

And they asked the States, do

1

first of all, Longchamps is one response to that in the

2

sense that in Pennsylvania they didn't need a statute.

3

They didn't pass a statute and -- and the -- the courts in

4

Pennsylvania understood that the law of nations was part

5

of their common law.

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but that goes against the notion

7

that there was an understood common understanding that was

8

the background.

9

Pennsylvania.

10

It was understood one way in

It was understood another way by -- by the

Continental Congress.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

I think what -- what -- the

12

way we would interpret the 1781 resolution is that the

13

1781 resolution was more a function of the Continental

14

Congress' inability to enforce the law of nations on

15

behalf of the Nation under the Articles of Confederation.

16

And so they had no way to respond to any incident,

17

including the Marbois incident after that resolution.

18

Now, they did -­

19
20

QUESTION:

Then why did they pass a resolution

saying to the States, enforce the common law?

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, what they did is they asked

22

the -- the States to enforce the law of nations.

And

23

Connecticut passed that particular statute in order to do

24

it.

25

that's not to suggest that they didn't decide that they

Other States did not act in response to that, but

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

already had adequate remedies.
Moreover, the resolution did more than just ask

3

the States to enforce the law of nations.

4

provided a new -- which was not a common law thing -- an

5

indemnity for the United States if the United States had

6

to do something to take up the slack for the States.

7

It also

And so from our standpoint, what -- what the -­

8

the 1781 resolution really does is that is the -- the step

9

is from 1781, feeling completely frustrated and not able

10

to enforce the law of nations, coming to the Constitution

11

where there's lots of evidence that the Founding Fathers

12

believed that we had to as a Nation enforce the law of

13

nations, having incidents like the Marbois incident and

14

the -- the attack on the ambassador in New York right

15

before them, deciding in the alien tort statute to make

16

those claims available.

17

Now, what -- what the Government and -- and

18

Petitioner Sosa want the Court to believe is that having

19

gone through the trouble of expressing to the world, to

20

the people, in terms of the -- that -- that we would as a

21

Nation enforce the law of nations, that then the Congress

22

just didn't do it because basically Congress didn't do

23

anything else to enforce the torts in violation of the law

24

of nations clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789.

Part -- part of the problem I have

political branches to conduct our foreign affairs.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I -- I find that

responses, Justice Scalia, to that question.
On the first one, in terms of whether the law of

12

nations is too indeterminate -- boundless I think is the

13

word that's used in the petitioner's brief -- this Court

14

has affirmed at least in -- on two occasions that I'm

15

aware of, in U.S. v. Smith and in Ex parte Quirin, the

16

fact that Congress can easily by reference incorporate the

17

law of nations and that it is not indeterminate enough to

18

justify a death sentence in the -- against the pirate in

19

the United States v. Smith in 1820 and 120-some-odd years

20

later against Nazi saboteurs in Ex parte Quirin.

21

Court -- it is perfectly permissible for the Congress,

particularly in 1789, to incorporate by reference what

European Union may think is bad and we may not think is

9

bad.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, but actually I think that

11

that is -- would not be a correct view of -- either of

12

what the courts did or what the courts ought to do.

13

fact, there are a relative handful of cases under the

14

alien tort statute in the last 25 years in which there

15

have been findings about violations of the law of nations.

16

They have tended overall to involve claims of torture,

17

genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, clearly

18

norms that the United States has supported from Nuremberg

on down.

jury and there was an arrest warrant that was limited to

the territorial boundaries of the United States.

MR. HOFFMAN:

9
10

Well -­
There was no authority to arrest

him in Mexico.
QUESTION:

-- yes, but I -- I think there's a

11

good argument that section 878 has extraterritorial

12

application, that DEA agents are not prevented from

13

carrying out their duties across our borders.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think that the -- the

15

distinction -- and -- and -- that needs to be made on that

16

is that it is clear that the Congress was aware, as we all

17

are aware, that the Drug Enforcement Administration has

18

involved in activities in other countries of a variety of

19

activities.

MR. HOFFMAN:

The -- the -- I hope to persuade

5

you otherwise on that point.

6

would draw, first of all, is that the fact that the DEA is

7

involved in some activities abroad doesn't mean that

8

Congress intended that any DEA officer or employee had

9

worldwide arrest authority at their discretion.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Bowman -- Bowman was about

jurisdiction to proscribe.

18

Government relies on Maul as the case for -- on the

jurisdiction to enforce.

20

interesting actually because what it does is it says that

21

the Coast Guard can be engaged in activities on the high

22

seas which are extraterritorial, but they're not within

23

the territory of another state.

24
25

And I think the -- the

And in fact, the -- the language in Maul is very
clear to talk about the law of nations and the

restrictions on the ability of the Coast Guard to do

because the high seas is a place where that kind of

authority can be maintained without any conflict with any

other nation or without any conflict with -- with the law

of nations.

would slice it one way or the other perhaps, although I

whether that's extraterritorial both in terms of the

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think that the difference would

be that the Congress -- one of the arguments that the

13

One is the Mansfield Amendment, which we have laid out in

14

our brief.

15

Mansfield Amendment means is that the DEA was

17

And basically our position is that what the

refers to foreign police action.

here.

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

within that at all.

25

But in the -- on the Government's

theory -­

22

24

There wasn't any such

None.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I don't see how it falls

But in the Government's theory,

what that would mean is that if -- if the Government

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

wanted to arrest a drug trafficker in Mexico and they -­

2

they would be barred by the Mansfield Amendment from

3

actually being involved in that arrest, even participating

4

in it unless the ambassador to Mexico approved it under

5

the -- the rules, but under their theory, they could

6

actually hire the people that they hired in this case to

7

arrest the trafficker.

8

that's what they're saying.

9

QUESTION:

10

Now, I don't -- that's -- but
And I -- I -­

What does the term direct mean?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I -- direct -- what -- what

11

happened in this case was certainly directly effecting the

12

arrest.

13

did is they directed that he be arrested.

What the -- what the DEA officials in this case

14

QUESTION:

Well, in that sense every arrest is a

15

direct arrest.

16

arrest I suppose on that theory.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

what the difference -­

19

There's no such thing as an indirect

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I think what the -­

Doesn't direct refer to the -- to the

20

actions of the agents?

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

But I think what the difference

22

was is the Mansfield Amendment was broader than just

23

arresting.

24

that Senator Mansfield took to Thailand where he was

25

concerned about the -- the fact that DEA agents were -­

The Mansfield Amendment came out of a trip

were even in any operations with foreign law enforcement

2

and they -- he thought that that caused problems to our

3

foreign relations and -- and the exercise of law

4

enforcement authority in other countries.

5

Now, that was -­

6

QUESTION:

If that was so, why didn't he just

7

eliminate from this as part of any foreign police action?

8

Why is that phase in there?

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, but the thing is from our

11

standpoint, I mean, this is a foreign -- this -- this is a

12

police action in a foreign country.

QUESTION:

Oh, no, no, no, no.

14

But that's not -­

You had -­

2

QUESTION:

Oh, I think you have to look very

3

closely at that language and -- and I think it may well

4

not fit this case.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the other -- the other

6

principle, though, which I think is the one that -- that I

7

think clearly applies to this case is -- is the principle

8

that statutes need to be interpreted to be consistent with

9

our international law obligations, the Charming Betsy

10

principle.

11

-- the Maul Court was certainly aware of the fact that

12

there were limits in the international law about the

13

ability to enforce our law extraterritorially.

14
15

And -- and there, even in the Maul case, the

QUESTION:

Okay.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

But -- but that's the other principle, and I -­

Sorry.

24

I think the one that -- that probably is most applicable

25

to the situation is the principle that you should presume

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that Congress did not intend to authorize violations of

2

international law, which is what occurred in this case.

3

And whether that's --

4

QUESTION:

They did it.

I mean, that's -­

5

that's the -- the two things that maybe you're going to

6

address now that are bothering me the most and they're

7

related is what the DEA says is that this was a person who

8

people in Mexico tortured to death.

9

they went in there for narcotics reasons.

10
11

This was not that
They wanted to

get the people who had tortured an American to death.
And how do we decide such a thing?

Should each

12

of the courts of the United States decide that

13

independently?

14

It's related to the problem of Mr. Mbeki.

15

Apartheid is a terrible thing, but according to the

16

government, Mr. Mbeki, I take it -- that's the highest

17

authority, the President of South Africa, has told the

18

United States that the judicial efforts to give

19

compensation to victims are interfering with his efforts

20

to build a democratic South Africa.

21

choose between those two?

22

Africa, protective of human rights has it all over

23

compensating the victims even though that's terrible.

24
25

Now, I have to

I'd say democratic South

And what I'm asking you is what kinds of
principles do you suggest that will allow Mr. Mbeki to

2

judges somewhere.

3

to whether this is the kind of effort to get a torturer or

4

whether it is a violation of -- of law?

5

principles of limitation in these areas?

6

And how will we decide such things as

MR. HOFFMAN:

What are the

Well, I think that the -- the

7

first -- in terms of the Alien Tort Claims Act, which I

8

think is where the South Africa example is coming from

9

mostly, I think that the -- there -- there are several

10

limitations that are inherent in the jurisprudence.

11

is that it's very difficult to find a customary

12

international law norm, and it's not -- it wasn't even

easy in this case.

15

can even find that the law of nations has evolved so that

16

the way that fishing vessels were treated during the

Napoleonic Wars might have been a matter of comity, but by

18

the Spanish-American War, they had ripened into customary

19

law, which we can find through the methods that have been

employed by the courts of this country since the very

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.
And -- and the importance of that

7

QUESTION:

Right.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- that the Ninth Circuit read it.

9

Under the Charming Betsy principle, what our principle is

10

is the one -- we adopt what the -- what the United States

11

adopts as the principle of international law, which was

12

laid out in Judge Sofaer's opinion in March 1980 through

13

the Office of Legal Counsel which basically said on a

14

review of all the international authorities, they found

15

that it was a violation of international law to forcibly

16

abduct somebody from another country if that country

17

protested.

18

The protest actually eliminates the problems

19

that the Government is talking about in terms of finding

20

consent and whether there's another government that's

21

recognized, all those things, because what Judge Sofaer

22

said in the opinion was that acquiescence equals consent.

23

The -- if a foreign government wants to assert

24

that limit on -- on U.S. law enforcement authority under

25

international law, it had better make a protest, as Mexico

59
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

did in this case.

2

unusual case is that you just don't find many situations

3

where there has been any kind of extraterritorial law

4

enforcement where there has been a sovereign protest.

5

And one of the reasons this is such an

QUESTION:

Okay, but there -- there -- I think

6

that the conduct that was the basis for the indictment

7

here, the kidnap and torture and murder of a U.S. DEA

8

agent in Mexico, can be punished in the United States in

9

accordance with international law under the effects

10

doctrine because we can criminalize conduct occurring in

11

another country that has an effect on our country's

12

security or core national interests, which clearly this

13

did.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

I completely agree with that.

15

There's no question.

There has never been in the case

16

that -- that the statute under which Dr. Alvarez was tried

17

was extraterritorial.

18

mind, I don't think anybody's mind, that the United States

19

in making that statute extraterritorial was acting

20

consistent with its international obligations.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

There's no question in -- in my

Right.
But there is a difference between

23

the jurisdiction to proscribe within international law and

24

-- and the jurisdiction to enforce those laws.

that the president of a country could think they're

The -- the one pertinent limitation -- and -­

19

and it's actually been raised by the other side -- is

20

exhaustion of local remedies.

21

the answer you got on exhaustion of local remedies was

22

some theorists think that that's part of international

23

law.

24

of the early alien tort statute cases, defendants did

25

raise exhaustion of local remedies.

And -- and what -- what -­

It is part of international law.

In fact, in a lot

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

One of the reasons that it hasn't been a big

2

issue is that a lot of the people that are coming to this

3

country to vindicate their human rights are refugees that

4

have fled from places like Burma or revolutionary Ethiopia

5

or other places that have no legal system and could not

6

possibly give a local remedy.

7

Now, that won't be the case for -- for cases

8

that arise in other contexts where there is.

And I think

9

the courts can dismiss based on exhaustion of local

10

remedies where there are remedies to be done, and that is

11

not something that -- the -- the court would apply that as

12

part of -- of international law, as part of the law of

13

nations because it is part of the law of nations.

14

And so the TVPA actually took the lead from the

15

alien tort statute in having an exhaustion of local

16

remedies issue, and I think that a lot of the -- the

17

issues about separation of powers and -- and the -- the

parade horribles about what might happen because of these

to instances of violation of basic norms of international

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think it -- I think it is.

10

And in fact, a Justice of this Court started it.

11

it's the Nuremberg principle that individuals can be

12

responsible for the violation of international human

rights.

14

done is provide a forum for people who have suffered

contradictory decisions creating a mess?

3

to separate the former from the latter is to look to see

4

if universal jurisdiction is part of or at least foreseen

5

by or at least consistent with the international law norm.

6

I'm looking for ways that are going to avoid the problems.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

And one good way

I would have two -- two responses

really.

One is that the universal jurisdiction principle

is primarily a principle of the assertion of criminal

jurisdiction for certain international crimes.

I think that the -- the -- our -- our objection

2

to that would be that it would be trying to -- to find a

3

limit that's really not in the statute and really is a -­

4

a function, we think, for Congress to decide.

5

there was a question before, has anybody -- has there ever

6

been an -- an attempt to change the alien tort statute?

7

As far as we know, there has never been a bill in Congress

8

to ask for any change.

9

Congress -­

In fact, the administration in the Filartiga

10

case and in Kadic later basically said -- in Filartiga,

11

they said it would be a problem for our foreign relations

12

if we refused to recognize a remedy in this kind of case.

13

And in the Torture Victim Protection Act, it is

14

very clear in the Senate and House reports, as clear as I

15

think Congress could possibly be, that Congress liked the

16

development in Filartiga case.

this case, explicitly with reference to Judge Bork's

QUESTION:

Congress rejected the

Well, they did -- they did in the

22

Tort Victim Protection Act provide a definite claim,

23

something with a -- with a statute of limitations, which

24

is not here, something with a definition of what torture

25

is, not tort, the world of tort, so that -- that that

69
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

looks like a model of specificity where 1350 is just the

2

opposite.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think -- well, that's

4

because of when 1350 was drafted.

5

I think that those problems are not as insurmountable as

6

they're made out to be.

7

to deal with those problems in the way that courts have

8

dealt with them in other areas of the law.

9

section 1983, for example, doesn't provide a lot of those

But I think that the -­

I think the courts have been able

10

things either, and courts have been able to fashion the

11

rules that would govern those kinds of cases -­

12

QUESTION:

But you -- you do -- in 1983, you do

13

have reference to very specific things, to provisions of

14

Federal statutory law or to provisions of the

15

Constitution.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, and you have -- you have in

17

section 1988 a -- a reference to State law, and this Court

18

has often had reference to State law and sometimes it's

19

had reference to rules that are based on -- on different

20

reasons.

21

But the -- the courts -- I mean, for example, in

22

the statute of limitations, the statute of limitations in

23

the Alien Tort Claims Act was -- was shorter before the

24

Torture Victim Protection Act, and since the Torture

25

Victim Protection Act, the courts have applied the statute

70
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

of limitations that Congress believes is appropriate to

2

those -- to those cases.

3

So I -- I want to -- I know I still don't answer

4

your -- I'm trying to answer your question.

And then my

5

-- my -- our feeling about that is that those kinds of

policy choices, where there are differences of opinion

7

even between administrations about how this should be -- I

8

9

great way to proclaim to the world our commitment to the

Some administrations think this is a

10

law of nations.

11

consistent with what the Founders thought about the law of

12

nations too.

the law of nations and the alien tort statute does that in

14

the international human rights field today.

15

that around the world and -- and it is true.

Our feeling is that is completely

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

Well, I think there are

3

two different -- there -- there are two different issues

4

there I think.

5

One is if the treaty -- if the United States in

6

the treaty has issued a reservation to the norm, then I

7

don't -- I don't think it's enforceable.

8

a reservation, we don't accept that norm.

9

I think there's

I think the -- the difference with the non­

10

self-executing declaration is that that doesn't mean that

11

we don't accept the norms.

12

declaration is -- is we might or we might not.

13

could be evidence and it might be something that would be

14

looked at by a court, but the -- what -- what -- because

15

Article VI of the Constitution says that treaties are the

law of the land and shall be enforced, including by the

17

courts of the -- of the States, if the United States

18

entered into human rights treaties without that

reservation, then many norms which are not customary norms

20

-- in the -- in the International Covenant on Civil and

No.

If there's a division of

in Sabbattino, the United States Government came into the

1

that there was a clear violation of international law, but

nevertheless, the act of state doctrine applied.

my recollection of Justice Harlan's opinion.

MR. HOFFMAN:

right, but that's my -- it was my recollection of the

13

opinion.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

But you may be

My point I guess would be, though,

15

that where there is diversity among nations or about the

16

norm, then I don't think they can be forced -- enforced

17

within the alien tort statute.

18

And I think that in the South Africa case, for

19

example, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if that would be

dismissed.

21

pending, and it may be that -- that that's the kind of

22

case that ought not to be in the courts.

much about the details of it, so it's very hard to make

that kind of comment.

that's where the decision should be made.

And if they

7

I see that my time is up.

8

And the -- the closing remark I -- I would make

9

really is that in -- in Ker v. Illinois in 1886, this

10

Court denied a remedy to someone who had been kidnapped

11

from another country and said that he could be tried

12

notwithstanding that violation.

13

that person would not be without a remedy, that all that

14

person had to do was bring a suit for trespass and false

15

arrest, and the Court was sure that that statement would

16

provide a remedy in the courts.

17

The Court also said that

After Dr. Alvarez's acquittal, he took up the

18

Court on that suggestion that he might get a remedy under

19

the statutes that Congress has -- where Congress has

20

authorized the courts to provide redress for -- for those

21

kinds of torts and for those kinds of violations of the

22

law of nations.

23

this Court and all we asked in the courts below is that

24

the courts perform the kinds of functions that courts have

25

performed for hundreds of years before the republic, all

And to -- all that we are asking from

during the republic in providing a damage remedy for the

2

violation of personal rights.

3

And upholding the modest judgment in this case

4

is not going to undermine our national security.

It will

only affirm the values that have made the -- the country

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

11

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER THE UNITED STATES

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

If I could first address the argument that is

14

advanced by respondent that we can solve the

15

extraterritorial arrest problem by simply insisting on

16

there being consent.

17

Alvarez-Machain opinion at footnote 16 made the point that

18

there are some issues that are best dealt with in

19

diplomatic relations between countries and not in the

20

courts of a single party.

21

I think this Court in its first

And I think consent for an extraterritorial

22

arrest is a prototypical example of that.

In diplomatic

23

relations between countries, a certain amount of ambiguity

24

can make the diplomatic relation function and so there may

25

be varying degrees of consent.

76
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In the context of a United States judicial

2

proceeding, though, the tendency is to bore down and find

3

out whether there was some modicum of consent, some legal

4

standard of consent.

5

example of Mir Aimal Kasi as how having courts bear down

6

and figure out the exact extent of consent between

7

Pakistan and FBI agents in 1997 would not have been a

8

productive exercise for the courts.

9

And I would point again to the

A very brief note on the Ker opinion, Ker

10

against Illinois that was just mentioned at the closing of

11

respondents' argument.

12

there might be an action for kidnapping in that case, but

13

this Court did not opine in any way what would be the

14

relevant law in that kidnapping that occurred in Peru.

15

would suggest if it had looked at that issue, it would

16

have suggested that the law that applied would be the law

17

of Peru in the same way that if there is any law that

18

applies to the false arrest here, it is the law of Mexico

19

and that only underscores that this arrest, even if it

20

were actionable somehow, would fall within the foreign

21

country exemption to the Federal Tort Claims Act.

22

It's true the Court said that

I

If I could say two things about section 1350.

23

The -- first of all, in terms of trying to divine exactly

24

what was in Congress' mind when it enacted this provision

25

in 1789, I would say that that is exceedingly difficult

77
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that strongly suggests that what the Court should do

2

is simply apply its rules for when there is a cause of

3

action.

4

at least one of the events that led to the passage of the

5

statute was, it was the events involving ambassadors in

6

the United States and violations and assaults on those

7

ambassadors.

8

is telling.

9

But if there is any agreement at all as to what

And I think the reaction to those assaults

First, there were no civil actions ever brought

10

in the courts that anybody is aware of to remedy those

11

actions.

What were brought are common law criminal

12

actions.

That's what the Longchamps case in Pennsylvania

13

was.

14

It was a common law criminal action.
Now, I don't think anybody would suggest that a

15

common law criminal action in law of nations somehow

16

survives this Court -- this Court's decision in Hudson,

17

saying there's no longer any common law criminal

18

jurisdiction.

19

Court -- the Congress may have had in mind some general

20

common law action that was available, there's no

21

particular reason why that decision should withstand the

22

Erie decision.

23

In the same way, to the extent that the

But again, I think it is noteworthy that there

was no civil action in response to those incidents.
