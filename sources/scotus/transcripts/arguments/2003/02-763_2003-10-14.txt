CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Lamken.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

As the Commissioner of Social Security has long

11

construed the disability insurance program, there can be

12

no finding of disability unless at least two conditions

13

are met.

14

severity that she cannot -- she is unable to do her

15

previous work.

16

severity that the claimant cannot, considering her age,

17

education, and experience, engage in any other kind of

18

substantial, gainful work which exists in the national

19

economy.

First, the claimant's impairment must be of such

Second, the impairments must be of such

20

Construing and applying those provisions for

21

more than 3 decades, the commissioner has consistently

22

concluded that if a claimant continues to function at a

23

level sufficient to meet the demands of past work, then

24

the claimant is not disabled without the necessity of

25

inquiring into whether that particular past job exists in

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

significant numbers.

2

the statutory text.

3

QUESTION:

That's the most natural reading of

Mr. Lamken, this case, I think,

4

involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the

5

act, and there are regulations under each.

6

MR. LAMKEN:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct.

It is --

Now, are there any relevant

8

differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on

9

this issue?

10

MR. LAMKEN:

No, Your Honor.

We don't believe

11

that there are any relevant differences, that the

12

commissioner's regulations and the statutes themselves are

13

all phrased in parallel if not identical language

14

throughout.

15

There is one difference in that for a disability

16

insurance, these title II provisions, you have to be

17

someone who has paid into the program in order to be

18

eligible for benefits on the way out; whereas, title XVI

19

is more of a welfare program where whether you've paid in

20

in the past doesn't matter.

21

one who has paid into the title II program would get

22

considerably more benefits than one who has not.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LAMKEN:

25

But that simply means that

But on the test.
On the test, it is an identical

test.

QUESTION:

There's no difference.

2

MR. LAMKEN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LAMKEN:

There is no test, Justice O'Connor.

Thank you.
That construction preserves the

5

distinction long recognized in the commissioner's

6

regulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's

7

regulations from the earliest days of administering this

8

statute.

9

and insurance against other causes of unemployment, such

Between disability insurance, on the one hand,

10

as technological and economic change, on the other, an

11

individual who's doing a job who remains fully capable of

12

doing that job, but then loses the job because of economic

13

change or perhaps the job never existed in significant

14

numbers and the individual chooses to leave, is not unable

15

to engage in that activity by reason of an impairment,

16

which is the test under the statute for being entitled to

17

benefits.

18

And it made sense for Congress to draw that line

19

because if someone continues to function at a level

20

sufficient to meet the demands of their previous work,

21

it's virtually certain that they're capable of doing some

22

work whether or not that particular past job exists in

23

significant numbers in the national economy.

24

isn't that the person is expected to return to that

25

particular past job.

The point

Rather, it is their continued

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

functioning at a level sufficient to meet the demands of

2

that job provides a highly accurate and administrable test

3

of the fact that they continue to function at a level

4

sufficient to meet the demands of work generally.

5

In a program that must resolve more than 2

6

million claims a year, the need for that type of a highly

7

administrable test, that type of highly accurate test is

8

particularly acute.

9

test one would have expected Congress to provide.

10

And this is precisely the type of

A potentially large number of Americans today do

11

not work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the

12

national economy.

13

whether they quit, are fired for misconduct, or leave for

14

other reasons which are good and sufficient, the court of

15

appeals would preclude the commissioner from denying them

16

benefits based on their continued capacity to do that past

17

job even if that job is still available to them, even if

18

the employer is on the phone begging them to return to the

19

job.

20

not compelling that result.

21
22
23

When those workers leave their jobs,

The commissioner reasonably construed the statute as

If there are no questions, I will reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

I have a -- a question about the

24

consistency of the argument you're now making with the --

25

with the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go

1

back more than 15 years.

2

that even if a person can do the job that he or she did 15

3

years ago, yet there's a likelihood that maybe that kind

4

of work isn't in abundant supply anymore.

5
6

MR. LAMKEN:

That seems to be a recognition

Justice O'Connor, the concern of

that 15-year --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LAMKEN:

9

The concern of that regulation isn't whether or

I'm Justice Ginsburg.
Oh, Justice Ginsburg.

11

numbers.

12

prophylactic test to make sure that the demands of that

13

job are demands that are ones that are likely to be

14

relevant in the national economy.

15

set of demands of a job would completely disappear from

16

the economy entirely during any one person's lifetime.

17

It provides an administrable and in fact

It's unlikely that a

But to make assurance doubly sure, to make

18

absolutely certain, the commissioner has set forth an

19

administrable bright line, 15-year rule that says if the

20

job is more than -- if you did the job more than 15 years

21

ago, we won't consider it out of that concern.

not a consideration of whether the particular past job

exists.

appropriate and accurate measure of your ability -- your

was now -- she was able to go out and find a job as a -- a

That's correct.

From -- if I

10

remember correctly, from 1988 to 1995, she worked as an

11

elevator operator.

12

QUESTION:

If the absence of elevator jobs had

13

occurred earlier and she hadn't been able to find this

14

job, she would clearly be disabled, wouldn't she?

No, Justice Stevens, I'm not sure

that she would be found disabled.

or not she had a severe --

MR. LAMKEN:

The commissioner would

She would have made the fifth step.
If you were not to consider the --

21

the previous work of an elevator operator and you only

22

applied the fifth step, which is the other work step, in

23

isolation, that's correct, that she would have been found

24

not able to do other work in the national economy.

25

the fifth step is designed to work in conjunction with all

the other previous steps and, standing alone, does not

2

necessarily represent an accurate determination.

3

Congress provided two conditions that must be

4

met, previous work and other work, precisely because the

somewhat abstract inquiry into other work that plaintiff

6

has -- the claimant has never done may not be a fully

7

accurate or necessarily an easily administered mechanism

8

for determining the level of work that the claimant can

9

do.

10

QUESTION:

See, the thought that was running

11

through my mind, just to put it on the table, is that in a

12

sense perhaps the Government's position creates a

13

disincentive to look for other marginal jobs when you're

14

in this position.

15

look.

16

You might be better off just not to

MR. LAMKEN:

Justice Stevens, the commissioner's

17

rules actually take into account incentives to look for

18

work through the unsuccessful work attempt regulations.

19

And so that is something that has been dealt with.

20

the same -- the same problem existed in the Walton case,

21

for example.

22

engaging in socially desirable conduct, going out and

23

working, will actually provide the evidence that shows

24

that they're capable of working, but that is just a

25

necessary consequence of a program that --

the court of appeals rule, the commissioner cannot deny

them benefits based on their demonstrated ability to do

that job.

It's any time somebody is

Suppose in Justice Stevens'

hypothetical the employer said, you know, you can operate

6-month job.

QUESTION:

MR. LAMKEN:

MR. LAMKEN:

QUESTION:

She can -- she can perform

She'd be better off not taking that

job.

MR. LAMKEN:

QUESTION:

In terms of getting --

Or suppose -- or -- or suppose she

13

didn't take that job.

14

MR. LAMKEN:

Would she then still be barred?
If the -- if she did take the job,

15

Justice Kennedy, and the job represented functioning at a

16

level that's consistent with work generally that is

17

substantial, gainful work, she would be barred.

18

perhaps might be better off not taking the -- taking a job

19

like that under the commissioner's regulations.

20

And she

However, the mere fact that somebody taking a

21

job provides evidence that they function at a level that

22

is consistent with past work doesn't mean that we should

come up with less accurate determinations by ignoring

their demonstrated capacity to engage in their -- in their

past work.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. --

QUESTION:

One -- one -- just one further

question.

it wouldn't be just a question that the burden would be

switched to the Government, she would automatically

prevail.

9

In -- in this case if she made it to step five,

Isn't that the case?
MR. LAMKEN:

Because of her age?

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

10

The -- the way the commissioner's grids are set up, they

11

make various assumptions regarding the effects of age, the

12

exertion levels demanded by particular jobs, and other

13

matters.

14

inquiry to look into the many jobs somebody hasn't done in

15

the past, the step five inquiry sometimes will render --

16

will deem somebody not -- will deem somebody disabled even

17

though they actually can work.

18

And because it is a somewhat hypothetical

It is precisely because of that reason that

19

Congress provided two measures of capacity to work:

20

highly empirical one, can the person do the jobs they

21

actually have previously done in the past; and second,

22

whether or not the person can engage in the other jobs

23

that they haven't actually done in the past.

24

the two steps work more accurately together, that's why we

those two steps.

2

In addition, it also preserves the line between

3

people who become unemployed because of their impairment,

4

and ones who happen to be fully capable of doing their

5

past jobs but lose those jobs for whatever reason, such as

6

either technological obsolescence or they simply choose to

leave those jobs voluntarily.

If there are no further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM S. ALTER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15
16
17

MR. ALTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Today the commissioner argues against its own
theme of providing a remedy when someone is disabled.
Congress did, indeed, intend to make a

18

difference, to separate step four, previous work, from

19

step five, or other work, but Congress told us what that

20

separation is.

21

At the fourth step, previous work, age is not a

22

factor, education is not a factor, and prior work

23

experience is not a factor.

24

person wasn't too old to do his job or her job in 1995, we

25

assume they weren't too old to do it in 1996.

This is simply because if a

If a person

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had the requisite education and skill level to perform the

2

past job in 1995, then they have the same skill level and

3

education level in 1996.

4

experience is irrelevant at step four because we're

5

talking about the actual job that she did.

6

And of course, prior work

What Congress didn't intend was to pretend that

7

a job that doesn't exist can still be used to deny

8

benefits.

9

concedes that.

It has to be gainful.

10

concedes that.

And it has to exist.

11

Work has to be substantial.

QUESTION:

But your -- no.

The commissioner
The commissioner

It has to exist in

12

substantial numbers in the national economy.

13

-- you're arguing that a job that does exist and that this

14

particular supposedly disabled person used to perform and

15

which is offered to that supposedly disabled person but

16

which that person turns down can, nonetheless, not count

17

against the person's disability.

18

MR. ALTER:

19

QUESTION:

What you're

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
So it seems to me it's your position

20

that -- that presents a really extraordinary situation.

21

Let's say I'm a juggler, and I become disabled.

22

and the circus I was a juggler at comes and says, you

know, we -- we want you back.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

And I turn them down.

I say, I'm tired of juggling.

And

2

you say that I'm handicapped even though my -- my prior

3

job is -- is right there waiting for me.

4

an extraordinary result.

That seems to me

5

MR. ALTER:

That is exactly what I'm saying,

6

Judge Scalia -- Justice Scalia.

7

reason I say that is because a person is not disabled or

8

not disabled at any one step of the sequential evaluation.

9

Your Honor's question focuses on the immediate reason for

I'm sorry.

And the

10

the disengagement of the person from the workforce.

11

That's not the commissioner's position.

12

the commissioner's position.

13

not disabled because of Ringling Brothers calls them on

14

the phone and says, please, come back.

15

by operation of the sequential evaluation.

16

That hasn't been

A person is not disabled or

They are disabled

And the commissioner is the one who promulgated

17

the sequential evaluation.

18

is a recipe with alternating steps regarding medical and

19

vocational factors.

20

QUESTION:

And the sequential evaluation

And -The commissioner has explained that

21

it's -- using this test, can you perform your most recent

22

job, as a proxy for instead of testing people to see the

23

range of light work that exists in the economy.

24

we're just using this as a shorthand because it's

25

administratively convenient.

They say,

therefore she is not disabled.

This particular job is a

Now, what's wrong with taking that position
instead of subjecting people to a whole battery of tests?

6

MR. ALTER:

position where -- and that's our position that happened in

19

this case.

20

would be an unintended consequence of the statute.

21

That's the extreme

And that's a very extreme position.

And it

But Your Honor is absolutely correct that that

22

is their position, that past work, even if it doesn't

23

exist in substantial numbers, is a proxy for her ability

24

to do other work.

25

What other work?

At the fifth step, she's disabled because she

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would not be able to make an adjustment to other work

2

which exists in substantial numbers in the national

3

economy, according to the commissioner's statistics.

5

QUESTION:
commissioner.

6

Well, it's not according to the

It's according to the statute.

Can -- can we focus on the -- on the words of

8

physical or mental impairments are of such severity that

10

previous work, but cannot, considering his age, education,

11

and work experience, engage in any other kind of

12

substantial, gainful work which exists in the national

13

economy.

14

Now, you want to take that last phrase, which

15

exists in the national economy, and attribute it to the

16

earlier phrase, previous work.

17

Congress meant, why wouldn't they just have said that he

18

is unable, considering his age, education, and work

19

experience, to engage in any substantial, gainful work

20

which exists in the national economy?

21

But if that's what

You -- you want to effectively read the first

2

MR. ALTER:

On the contrary, Your Honor.

The

3

words, any other kind, would be superfluous.

4

indeed, intended to make a difference between previous

At the fifth step, it is the commissioner who

must show that she isn't disabled.

words, which exist in the national economy, are in there

to begin with because what they wanted to preclude was the

it's very bad, she automatically is going to get the money

is a remedy that the commissioner can use for their

convenience.

would preclude her from her past job.

end because it's the unemployment office that's concerned

about people who are out of work because you don't have

concerned about people who are physically hurt or mentally

We've told you

Mr. Alter, if --if we think the

MR. ALTER:

If the statute is ambiguous, the

Mr. Alter, how do you deal with the

fact that a number of circuits and, indeed, three judges

20

on this en banc court thought exactly that, that this was

21

an ambiguous regulation, that it had been applied

22

consistently by the Secretary, and that it was entirely

23

reasonable, the -- the notion that your current work is a

24

proxy for can you do light work, that that's a -- not a

necessary or inevitable one, but a reasonable one?

it's a proxy to do light work.

QUESTION:

Proxy to do light

She wins at light work at step five.

No.

So again,

Step five in her case we've

6

established is an automatic.

It's not that she's shown

7

that she can't do light work.

The commissioner says,

8

look, when you get to be 55 years old, we're not going to

9

mess with that.

10
11

If you can't do your prior job, that's

it.

because she can't make an adjustment to any jobs.

person can do light work, that proxy issue, she can do her

14

But to answer your question about the other

20

circuits, the other circuits -- circuits focused on the

21

regulation, focused on the ruling, 82-61.

23

It's whether you can do that job.

back to the statute -- that new regulation is an

impermissible construction of the statute.

that Chevron deference will only apply to an agency's

adjudication.

QUESTION:

I understand.

assert that if Chevron means that if we find some sort of

ambiguity in a Federal statute, we give pretty much carte

QUESTION:

If it's reasonable.

If the agency

2

has given it a reasonable construction.

And from former

questions this morning, the suggestion is that the

regulatory approach is kind of an administrative shortcut

for finding out whether this employee is basically able to

do certain types of light work.

MR. ALTER:

I would argue, Your Honor, that it

8

is not reasonable in any -- by any stretch of the word

9

because may I remind, Your Honor, that we're talking about

10

a job which may not exist at all, and a finding that a

11

person is not disabled because they're capable of doing a

job that doesn't exist can't be reasonable.

Why is that?

If we take --

That was wrong.

The question is how severe

exactly how far -- how severe it has to be.

with work generally.

Second, in terms of the deference to which the

commissioner's construction is entitled, this has been the

after.

commissioner's regulations from 1978, and any -- any

24

ambiguity in those regulations was cleared up in 1982 with

25

respect -- by the issuance of SSR 82-40.

The commissioner's current regulations, which

2

became effective September 25th, now make it abundantly

3

clear and explain in absolutely certain terms that the

4

commissioner does not consider whether or not the previous

5

work exists in significant numbers in the national

economy.

7

because it is clearly the commissioner's well-considered

and longstanding interpretation of the statute, it is

entitled to deference.

Because that is the result of a rulemaking,

Yes.

In fact, there was a very --

years actually after the comment period was completed.

MR. LAMKEN:

The one thing that -- that it
