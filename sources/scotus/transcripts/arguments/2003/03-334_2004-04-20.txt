Mr. Gibbons.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. GIBBONS

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. GIBBONS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

What is at stake in this case is the

11

authority of the Federal courts to uphold the rule of

12

law.

13

absolutely immune from judicial examination whenever

14

they elect to detain foreign nationals outside our

15

borders.

16

the detention, the conditions of their confinement,

17

nor the fact that they have been wrongfully detained

18

makes the slightest difference.

19

Respondents assert that their actions are

Under this theory, neither the length of

Respondents would create a lawless enclave

20

insulating the executive branch from any judicial

21

scrutiny now or in the future.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Gibbons, I understand that

23

your clients have been detained approximately two

24

years?

25

MR. GIBBONS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Supposing they had only been

2

detained six months, how much would that weaken your

3

case?

4

MR. GIBBONS:

It wouldn't weaken it at all

5

because as I'll get into in the argument, the case

6

depends on compliance with provisions of a binding

7

treaty, which requires a prompt determination of

8

their status.

9

QUESTION:

So they would have had a habeas

10

corpus entitlement, in your view, within weeks after

11

their, after their detention?

12

MR. GIBBONS:

They would have had

13

entitlement to the process specified in the Geneva

14

Convention, and if they had that process --

15
16

QUESTION:

Did they have that right when

they were in Afghanistan?

17

MR. GIBBONS:

They allege not, and on this

18

record, you have to assume that, as did the Court of

19

Appeals.

20

QUESTION:

But now in Johnson vs.

21

Eisentrager, we said that the Geneva Convention did

22

not confer a private right of action.

23

MR. GIBBONS:

Your Honor, the question of

24

the private right of action really is not presented

25

in this case.

We are not asking to imply a private

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

right of action from the Geneva Convention or any

2

other treaty.

3

of action is created by the Habeas Corpus Statute and

4

by the Administrative Procedure Act.

5

provides a rule of decision, not a cause of action.

6

What we are saying is that the cause

QUESTION:

The treaty

Well, I guess, at least the

7

question presented is just whether the Federal court

8

has jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, Section

9

2241, is that right?

10

MR. GIBBONS:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And you don't raise the issue

12

of any potential jurisdiction on the basis of the

13

Constitution alone.

14

jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, is that right?

15
16

We are here debating the

MR. GIBBONS:
O'Connor.

That's correct, Justice

As a matter of fact --

17

QUESTION:

1331.

18

MR. GIBBONS:

I thought --

It doesn't depend on Section

19

1331, although the Administrative Procedure Act claim

20

does depend on Section 1331.

21
22

QUESTION:
that here or not?

That's what I'm asking.

You mentioned the APA claim.

23

MR. GIBBONS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Is

Yes.

I thought you were still

asserting that, are you not?

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GIBBONS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes.

I'm asserting that.

So it isn't just habeas then,

it's also --

4

MR. GIBBONS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GIBBONS:

That does --

It's also 13 -Your Honor, Justice Scalia,

7

it does depend on Section 1331.

8

QUESTION:

9

So we have two things, the

Habeas Statute and 1331?

10

MR. GIBBONS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GIBBONS:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes.

But you still win.
Now --

If you win under the Habeas

Statute?

15

MR. GIBBONS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GIBBONS:

Oh, absolutely.

Yes.
No.

You don't need both.
We don't.

Now, if you

18

look at the Court of Appeals ruling in this case, the

19

Court of Appeals assumed that these people were

20

friendly aliens, assumed that they had never been

21

members of any armed forces, and had never carried

22

out any belligerent activity against the United

23

States.

24

required by the Geneva Convention to determine

25

whether or not in fact they were civilians who should

Assumed that they had never had the hearing

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

have been repatriated.

2

What the Court of Appeals held was, and

3

it's on page 1141 of the court's opinion, if the

4

Constitution does not entitle detainees to due

5

process, and it does not, they cannot invoke the

6

jurisdiction of our courts to test the

7

constitutionality or legality of restraints on their

8

liberty.

9

Thus the Court of Appeals assumed that

10

the -- that the result turned on the absence of a

11

constitutional right, and that simply misreads the

12

Habeas Corpus Statute.

13

carried forward in virtually identical language from

14

Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, antedated

15

the Bill of Rights.

16

required is Federal custody simpliciter, and that

17

gives habeas corpus jurisdiction.

18

QUESTION:

Section 2241(c)(1), which is

All it required, all it has ever

Well, but other than producing

19

the person before the court so that the system is

20

satisfied that we know where the person is, surely

21

you have to go beyond that and assert some sort of

22

right.

And you -- you say that --

23

MR. GIBBONS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Of course.

-- the Geneva Convention is

really not the basis for the cause of action, which I

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

agree, so where do we go after that?

2

in front of the court.

3

MR. GIBBONS:

So he is here

Now what?
Your Honor, the Geneva

4

Convention is the supreme law of the land.

5

what the Constitution says about habeas.

6

QUESTION:

But it may not be

7

self-executing.

8

indications are it's not.

9

That's the problem, I guess.

MR. GIBBONS:

10

That's

QUESTION:

The

Your Honor, Your Honor --

Forgetting the Geneva

11

Convention, what happens when the person comes before

12

the court?

13

corpus, it comes here, and the judge says, now what

14

am I supposed to do.

15

You prevail and there is a writ of habeas

MR. GIBBONS:

What the judge is supposed

16

to do is determine first whether or not the

17

government's response that the detention is legal is

18

in fact an adequate response.

19

this case probably will respond, we don't have to

20

give the hearings required by the Geneva Convention.

21

But if you're going to treat a binding United States

22

treaty as the supreme law of the land, that is not an

23

adequate answer.

24
25

Now, the government in

Now, this question of, is the treaty
self-executing or not self-executing, I suggest is a

straw man.

2

of decision and something else provides a cause of

3

action, the treaty nevertheless provides the rule of

4

decision.

5

Since 1813, if a treaty provides a rule

That was several -QUESTION:

But Johnson said quite

6

specifically that the Geneva Convention was not

7

available to the Petitioners in that case because it

8

did not confer any right of action.

9

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, Your Honor, I think

10

the latter part of your sentence is probably an

11

overreading of Johnson.

12

is clearly distinguishable from this case, there were

13

three critical facts.

14

admitted enemy aliens.

15

they are not.

16

In Johnson, which I suggest

One was that they were
Our Petitioners plead that

The other was that they had a hearing

17

before a military tribunal which comported with

18

Federal legislation and with the extant rules of

19

international law, and our Petitioners have had no

20

such hearing.

21

QUESTION:

Well --

22

QUESTION:

But I take it you are --

23

QUESTION:

-- if you, if you, if your

24

clients here had been given the review that has been

25

described to us in the government's brief, by

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

military authorities to determine whether these

2

people are indeed being held as enemy combatants,

3

would you be here if you knew that that review had

4

been provided?

5
6

MR. GIBBONS:

We would not be.

What we

are seeking is the review provided --

7

QUESTION:

Well, I don't see how that --

8

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that depend on what

9

the review showed?

And I thought you have alleged that

10

your

11

clients were not enemy aliens.

12

were tourists, they were just picked up by mistake,

13

would you be here or would you not be here?

14

MR. GIBBONS:

If it showed they

If they were detained after

15

a hearing determined that they were civilian

16

detainees who under Article IV of the Geneva

17

Convention should be repatriated, we would be here.

18

QUESTION:

I don't see how those merits

19

question go to the issue of jurisdiction of the

20

Court.

21

mentioned were changed, you'd be entitled to judgment

22

here, even though the plaintiffs in Eisentrager were

23

not entitled to judgment, but we are not talking

24

about the merits right now.

25

jurisdiction.

It may well be that if those factors you

We are talking about

Certainly jurisdiction doesn't turn on

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the merits whether you were an enemy alien or not.

2

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, I suggest that a fair

3

reading of Eisentrager is that that did turn on the

4

merits.

5

QUESTION:

No, but I thought your -- may

6

I, may I ask you this, because I'm having the trouble

7

Justice Scalia is having.

8

argument on the basis of Eisentrager was that it

9

cannot stand for the proposition that there is no

I thought your principal

10

jurisdiction because in fact, in Eisentrager, there

11

was enough mention of matters on the merits so that

12

it was clear that's what was driving the ultimate

13

resolution in Eisentrager.

14

And it cannot stand for the proposition

15

that a court cannot even inquire, and the only issue

16

we have got is whether under the Habeas Statute the

17

court can even inquire.

18

position?

19
20

MR. GIBBONS:

Do I misunderstand your

No, you do not, Justice

Souter.

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

22

MR. GIBBONS:

It's our position that

23

Eisentrager was a decision on the merits as a matter

24

of fact.

25

were extended the same preliminary hearing as the

The Court says that they -- Petitioners

Washington, DC 20005

1

sufficiency application that was extended in Quirin,

2

Yamashita and Hirota versus McArthur, all of which

3

were decisions on the merits.

4

QUESTION:

But in several different

5

places, Mr. Gibbons, in Eisentrager, the Court says

6

that we are talking about the Habeas Statute, and we

7

are saying these Petitioners are not entitled to

8

habeas.

9

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, they are not as a

10

matter -- let me be clear about that.

11

the merits in Eisentrager is perfectly correct.

12

the Court did in Eisentrager was apply the scope of

13

review on habeas corpus, which was standard at that

14

time.

15

jurisdiction, that ended the habeas inquiry.

16

The result on
What

If the military tribunal had lawful

QUESTION:

Well, there is another problem.

17

At that time, that case was decided when Ahrens

18

against Clark was the statement of the law, so there

19

is no statutory basis for jurisdiction there, and the

20

issue is whether the Constitution by itself provided

21

jurisdiction.

22

And of course, all that's changed now.

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, Your Honor, in

23

Eisentrager, both the Court of Appeals and the

24

Supreme Court made it clear that they disapproved,

25

they were not adopting the ruling of the District

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Court based on Ahrens v. Clark.

before the Court.

Of course, in any

That's a Rule 12(b)(2) issue of in

In Eisentrager, the Court assumed

QUESTION:

Well, you didn't raise the question

8
9

of whether the territorial jurisdiction provision

10

covered it.

11

they were outside the district under the ruling in

12

Ahrens against Clark, which means they had to rely on

13

the Constitution to support jurisdiction, which in

14

turn means that once they have overruled Ahrens

15

against Clark, which they did, there is now a

16

statutory basis for jurisdiction that did not then

17

exist.

18

There was no territorial jurisdiction if

MR. GIBBONS:

Your Honor, respectfully, I

19

don't think you can fairly read Justice Jackson's

20

opinion as adopting the Ahrens v. Clark position.

21

QUESTION:

No.

But Ahrens v. Clark was

22

the law at the time of that decision, and it was

23

subsequently overruled.

24

decided when the legal climate was different than it

25

has been since Ahrens against Clark was overruled.

So that -- that case was

1

MR. GIBBONS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GIBBONS:

Well -- in any event --

Let me help you.
In any event, there is no

4

question that the Ahrens v. Clark rule does not apply

5

today.

6

These Respondents are the proper Respondents.
QUESTION:

Of course, it's a question of

7

how much it doesn't apply, whether it doesn't apply

8

only when there is at least clear statutory

9

jurisdiction in one, in one Federal court so it's

10

almost a venue call.

11

overruled when there is no statutory jurisdiction in

12

any Federal court. That's certainly an open question.

13

It isn't clear that it's been

Well, Your Honor, as to the

absence of jurisdiction, 2241(c)(1) could not be

It's been plain for 215 years.

QUESTION:

We'll take it from the

battlefield, and a week later, 10 miles away, then

3

six months later, a thousand miles away.

4

MR. GIBBONS:

In the zone of active

5

military operations or in an occupied area under

6

martial law, habeas corpus jurisdiction has never

7

extended.

It is the common law.

8

QUESTION:

Suppose it's Guantanamo.

9
10

MR. GIBBONS:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Well, the --

A declared war and a lawful

combatant.
MR. GIBBONS:

A declared war and someone

14

who has been determined to be a combatant in

15

accordance with Article V of the Geneva Convention,

16

an application for a writ of habeas corpus in those

17

circumstances would, under Rule 12(b)(6), be

18

summarily dismissed.

19

QUESTION:

You are close to the merits.

20

QUESTION:

You are back to the Geneva

21

Convention again, so I just have to assume your case

22

depends on the Geneva Convention.

23

MR. GIBBONS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, it --

It's not self-executing.
It depends on the Geneva

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Convention and on the military regulations duly

2

adopted and binding on the military forces of the

3

United States.

4

QUESTION:

But isn't that the merits case

5

that you are talking about?

6

jurisdictional argument doesn't depend, as I

7

understand it, on military regulations or the Geneva

8

Convention.

9

It depends on this statute.

MR. GIBBONS:

10

I mean, your

QUESTION:

No.

It does not.

If you get into court, your

11

clients may raise Geneva Convention and all sorts of

12

things, but that's not what your case here depends

13

on.

14

MR. GIBBONS:

No.

Our position is that

15

the Habeas Corpus Statute has meant what it said

16

since 1789.

17

QUESTION:

I mean, you have to think down

18

the road, is there an alternative to the Geneva

19

Convention that is on the substantive claim.

20

also thinking, and here I want your view on it, that

21

if you have, if they get in the door, and now they

22

have a claim that they are being held without a

23

competent tribunal assessing it, you get to your

24

route as well by saying that the part about the Fifth

25

Amendment in Eisentrager is, in effect, overruled by

I was

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Reid v. Covert.

And in fact, if you follow Harlan

2

and by following Harlan, you apply some kind of due

3

process, and the Geneva Convention comes in to inform

4

the content of that due process.

5

Now, is there an argument there or not?

6

MR. GIBBONS:

7

Honor, but since --

8
9

There certainly is, Your

QUESTION:

You're not simply being polite?

I want to --

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. GIBBONS:

12

QUESTION:

I have more to say about it.

But you do have the impediment,

13

Mr. Gibbons, that the D.C. Circuit said it decided

14

the merits as well as jurisdiction, so I think

15

Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy were asking you

16

before, well, if you prevail on jurisdiction under

17

that opinion, don't you go out the door immediately

18

because the D.C. Circuit said, at least as far as the

19

Constitution is concerned, nonresident aliens have no

20

due process rights.

21

MR. GIBBONS:

As far as the Constitution

22

is concerned, that's what the District of Columbia

23

Circuit said.

24

--

25

Now, as to whether or not that's right

QUESTION:

But that's not before us.

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GIBBONS:

2

QUESTION:

3

First of all --

Whether -- as I take it we ask

you to address only the bare jurisdictional question.

4

MR. GIBBONS:

The bare jurisdictional

5

question depends on Federal custody simpliciter, and

6

then the Court goes on to decide, is there any legal

7

basis for the government's response to the writ.

8
9

QUESTION:

Can I ask this, Mr. Gibbons.

If the jurisdictional question rests on Habeas

10

Statute simpliciter, without reference to the Geneva

11

Convention or any of the other merits points that

12

you've been raising, how then do you answer Justice

13

Kennedy's question if the merits are out and it

14

doesn't matter whether you are a combatant or

15

noncombatant, is there jurisdiction when somebody is

16

captured on the field of battle and held immediately

17

on the field of battle, why wouldn't there be

18

jurisdiction there?

19

merits answers, not jurisdictional answers.

20

The only answers you give are

MR. GIBBONS:

Your Honor, what I'm

21

suggesting is that whether you call it jurisdiction

22

or whether you call it the merits, in the battlefield

23

situation, it's going to go out under Rule 12, in any

24

event.

25

QUESTION:

But that's, that's quite

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

different.

2

about here is jurisdiction.

3

know, you have Justice Kennedy's example, a lawful

4

combatant, a declared war, detained at Guantanamo

you still have to summarily dismiss under the

hypothetical, right?

MR. GIBBONS:

Yes, Justice Kennedy --

mystical ultimate sovereignty of Cuba over, as we

MR. GIBBONS:

That's exactly what it says

-- yes.
QUESTION:

Now, it also says Cuba retains

sovereignty.
MR. GIBBONS:

It does not say that.

It

16

says that if the United States decides to surrender

17

the perpetual lease, Cuba has ultimate sovereignty,

18

whatever that means.

19

dealing with the word sovereignty, it doesn't

20

self-define.

21

QUESTION:

Now, for lawyers and judges

Excuse me.

Does it say that,

22

Cuba has ultimate sovereignty only if the United

23

States decides to surrender?

24

MR. GIBBONS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Where would that text be?

MR. GIBBONS:

Perhaps one of my colleagues

can find the language in the appendix.

4

QUESTION:

Why don't you go ahead.

5

MR. GIBBONS:

But, for example, if one of

6

the detainees here assaulted another detainee in

7

Guantanamo, there is no question they would be

8

prosecuted under American law because no other law

9

applies there.

10

Cuban law doesn't apply there.

Now, if the test is sovereignty, that term

11

must be given some rational meaning by judges.

12

Respondents concede that habeas corpus would extend

13

to citizens detained in Guantanamo.

15

habeas corpus to noncitizens there is no more an

16

interference with Cuban sovereignty.

17

That would be no

If there isn't -- if there isn't

So it's --

10

so it's so totally artificial to say that because of

11

this provision in the lease, the executive branch can

12

create a no law zone where it is not accountable to

any judiciary, anywhere.

14

Now, in some other places where the United

States has a base, there may be other civil authority

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, Your Honor, I was also

I think Justice Kennedy joined the opinion.
MR. GIBBONS:

Well, he did.

But he wrote

10

separately, I think, and at least cast some doubt on

11

whether or not he agreed with your position that

12

there is no Fifth Amendment right for an alien

13

outside the United States.

14

Now, of course, that reading of

15

Eisentrager assumes that it was a decision on the

16

merits and not a jurisdictional decision.

17

that as it may, our position, and again, it's not

necessary for reversal in this case, and perhaps

19

should not even be addressed because you could avoid

1

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

2
3

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

4

The United States is at war.

Over 10,000

5

American troops are in Afghanistan today in response

6

to a virtually unanimous Congressional declaration of

7

an unusual and extraordinarily -- extraordinary

8

threat to our national security, and an authorization

9

to the President to use all necessary and appropriate

10

force to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against

11

the United States.

12

It's in that context that Petitioners ask

13

this Court to assert jurisdiction that is not

14

authorized by Congress, does not arise from the

15

Constitution, has never been exercised by this Court

Would there then be jurisdiction?

GENERAL OLSON:

It is not irrelevant,

here, even the dissent in that case said that it

would be fantastic to assume that habeas corpus

jurisdiction would exist in the time of war.

6

that case is not --

QUESTION:

No, but your position does not

depend on the existence of a war?

GENERAL OLSON:

It doesn't depend upon

10

that, Justice Stevens, but it's even more forceful.

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

What if the American citizen

was in the middle of the battlefield in Iraq?
GENERAL OLSON:

We would still argue that

15

the jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute would not

16

extend under these circumstances to a wartime

17

situation, Justice Stevens, but that the -- what the

18

Eisentrager Court said, that there is enhanced

19

respect with respect to the power of the Court under

20

the habeas corpus jurisdiction with respect to

21

questions involving citizenship.

22

But what was unquestionable with respect

23

to that case is that an alien who had never had any

24

relationship to the United States and who was being

25

held as a result of a combat situation or a war

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

situation in a foreign jurisdiction, there was no

2

jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute.

3

QUESTION:

Well, it's clear that there was

4

no relief.

What do you say to Mr. Gibbons' position

5

that because in fact they did discuss the merits,

6

that case cannot really be taken as authority for

7

the -- leaving Ahrens and Braden aside, that the case

8

cannot be taken as authority for the proposition that

9

there is no jurisdiction in the sense of allowing the

10

person through the door to make whatever claim the

11

person wants to make.

12

What is your response to that?

GENERAL OLSON:

Our response to that is

13

throughout the decision in Eisentrager, the Court

14

referred to the question of jurisdiction.

15

QUESTION:

Oh, it did.

16

GENERAL OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

It starts --

I'm really not asking a

18

question about, frankly, about the Court's

19

terminology.

20

case.

I'm asking about the holding in the

21

GENERAL OLSON:

22

QUESTION:

The holding --

The mere argument is you can't

23

say it held anything more than that there was no

24

relief at the end of the road.

25

GENERAL OLSON:

It held that there was no

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

relief at the end of the road, because the ultimate

question, to use the words of the Court, the ultimate

question is jurisdiction.

again said that we are deciding how far the Habeas

5

Statute reaches.

6

QUESTION:

The Court over and over

General Olson, would you look

7

at page 777 of the Johnson v. Eisentrager opinion,

it does say we are here confronted with, and there is

10

a whole list of things.

11

12

by a military commission sitting outside the United

13

States.

14

And one of them is, is an

Why would the Court think it necessary to

15

say this is what we confronted in this case which

16

makes it worlds different from our case, where there

17

has been no trial and conviction, where these people

18

are saying, and we must accept for the moment that

19

it's true, that they are innocents.

20

not combatants of any kind.

21

GENERAL OLSON:

That they are

Well, those were

22

unquestionably facts that related to the case, that

23

related to the facts that came to the Court, but in

24

the very next paragraph, the Court goes on to say

25

that we have pointed out that the privilege of

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

litigation has been extended to aliens whether

2

friendly or enemy, that specifically addresses one of

3

the points you mentioned, only because permitting

4

their presence in the country implied protection.

5

And the Court went on to say, no such

6

basis can be invoked here for these prisoners at no

7

relevant time were within any territory over which

8

the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of

9

their offense, their capture, their trial and their

10

punishment were all beyond the territorial

11

jurisdiction of the United States.

12

And earlier in that --

13

QUESTION:

Their trial and their

14

punishment.

15

very difficult decision to understand.

16

it's at least ambiguous.

17

This is a completed episode.

GENERAL OLSON:

This is a

I would say

It seems to me -- it seems

18

to me that those statements all have to be read in

19

the context -- context of the Court saying the

20

ultimate question is jurisdiction.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

But it was so unnecessary to

say, to give that list that appears on page 777.
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I suspect that there

24

are many decisions of this Court where, when the

25

Court is dealing with the facts of a specific case,

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

especially in the context of a Court of Appeals

2

decision, if the Court were to turn to the briefs

3

that were written before to present the issue in this

4

Court, the only -- the question presented, submitted

5

in this case, in this Court, in Eisentrager was the

6

jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute.

7

arose in the context where the Court of --

QUESTION:

But the case

Was it really -- was it really

under the Habeas Statute or under the Constitution?

10

GENERAL OLSON:

11

QUESTION:

It was --

Because if the, if the views of

12

the dissenters in Ahrens against Clark were the law

13

at that time as they perhaps are now, then there

14

would have been statutory jurisdiction, which was not

15

present at that time.

16

GENERAL OLSON:

But the Court was

17

specifically focusing on the jurisdictional incidents

18

attached to the condition of the individual --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

the Habeas Statute.

2

GENERAL OLSON:

The Court specifically did

3

say, but did not mention the statute, Justice

4

O'Connor, but the statute is mentioned throughout the

5

briefs, in the government's brief when it says what

6

-- the statute at issue, the Habeas Corpus Statute

7

and within its territory, the language of Part A.

8

The statute that exists today is the same statute

9

that the Eisentrager Court was considering.

10

QUESTION:

Well, the briefs may have

11

mentioned it, but wasn't the problem that Eisentrager

12

had to confront, the problem created by Ahrens,

13

construing respective jurisdiction, and therefore,

14

the only way there could be habeas jurisdiction in

15

Eisentrager was if due process demanded it.

16

And the Court went on to say, well, there

17

are various reasons why there is no ultimate due

18

process entitlement, and therefore, due process does

19

not demand entertainment of jurisdiction.

20

After Braden, that argument is gone.

Why,

21

therefore, is Eisentrager not undercut to the point

22

where it's no further authority on the jurisdictional

23

point?

24
25

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it seems to me again

the entire opinion has to be taken in context.

The

33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Court did specifically say that there is no statutory

2

authority.

number a provision of the code, but it specifically

4

said no statutory authority.

5
6

It didn't say, it didn't identify by

QUESTION:

The reason it said that was

because Ahrens was then the law.

7

QUESTION:

Yeah.

8

QUESTION:

And that was very clear in the

9
10
11

Court of Appeals opinion.

They rested their decision

solely on the Constitution.
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, Justice Stevens, I

12

submit that in the context of the case, in the

13

context of the way the dissent understood it, as well

14

as the majority understood it --

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but the fact case was --

16

the case was decided when the majority view in Ahrens

17

was the law, and that is no longer the law.

3

Justice Black in his dissenting opinion

4

says this decision would apply to whether someone was

5

hostile or not, and the entire context of the case,

6

Justice Stevens, it seems to me, and does not --

7

QUESTION:

The context of the case was it

8

was decided at a time when Ahrens against Clark was

9

the law.

And if the dissenting opinion in Ahrens

10

against Clark had been the law, it would have been

11

decided differently.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it seems to me that

13

a fair reading of the case goes much further than

14

that, because the Court was not focusing on that.

15

didn't specify that it was making its decision on

16

that basis.

17

the dissent referred to this as well, that it was

focusing on the fact that the individuals bringing

the petition had no sufficient contacts with the

20

United States.

The District Court relied

upon that decision.

8

further with respect to -- in fact, the Court, and

9

this Court, Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court

10

in this case specifically points out that the Court

11

of Appeals went back to something it called

12

fundamentals, because it couldn't find any authority

13

in either the statute or the Constitution.

14

GENERAL OLSON:

I believe that's a correct

characterization.

What -- the other portion of the

20

decision that it seems to me important to recognize

21

is that this is a decision that was widely perceived,

22

and has been consistently perceived, as a definition

of the scope of the Habeas Statute.

statement that if this had been a citizen held in

Guantanamo, that habeas would be available.

Now, if the citizen can say that he is a

11

GENERAL OLSON:

I think, Justice Kennedy,

12

the answer to that is, in the first place, we are

13

not, we are not saying that there necessarily would

14

be jurisdiction there, but we are saying that the

15

Court -- that the Court would go further with respect

16

to that because, and this is also in Eisentrager and

17

a number of other Court's -- of this Court's

18

decisions, that the Court will find more protection

19

for citizens as a result of the relationship going

20

back --

22
23

QUESTION:

Well, but the only way we can

QUESTION:

I don't, I don't mean to

do it --

24

misconstrue it or to misstate it, I had thought you

25

said at the outset that if this had been a citizen of

1

the United States held in Guantanamo, there would be

2

habeas corpus.

3

GENERAL OLSON:

We are not -- we are

4

saying that we would not be contesting it, Justice

5

Kennedy, and the Court will be dealing with other

6

issues involving citizens.

7

QUESTION:

You don't have to contest the

8

jurisdictional objection.

9

jurisdiction, there is no jurisdiction, whether you

10
11

If there is no

contest it or not.
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I guess the only way

12

I can answer this, Justice Stevens, is to say that

13

what the Court seemed to say, not only in the

14

majority opinion, but in the dissenting opinion, that

15

more rights would be given to citizens --

16

QUESTION:

No, but there are no rights

17

that can be recognized unless there is jurisdiction

18

in the first place.

19

make good on what you have just said it said, it has

20

got to do so presupposing jurisdiction.

21

are going to rely upon those statements, don't you

22

necessarily have to concede jurisdiction?

And if the Court is going to

23

GENERAL OLSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

So if you

I don't --

With respect to the citizen?

Doesn't make any difference if they have got lots of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

rights if there is no jurisdiction to get into a

2

court to enforce them.

3

GENERAL OLSON:

I think that the answer is

4

that that does not necessarily follow.

5

not reached that decision yet, and that's something

6

that is not before the Court.

7

QUESTION:

The Court has

Certainly the argument is

8

available that in that situation, the Constitution

9

requires jurisdiction.

The Constitution requires

10

that an American citizen who has the protection of

11

the Constitution have some manner of vindicating his

12

rights under the Constitution.

13

argument.

14

GENERAL OLSON:

That would be the

I agree with that, justice

15

Scalia, and this Court has said again and again that

16

--

17
18
19

QUESTION:

And that was part of his

argument in Eisentrager.
GENERAL OLSON:

And it was -- and in that

20

case, the Court specifically said the Fifth Amendment

21

did not extend to the Petitioners in that case.

22

Court has said that again in the Verdugo case in

23

terms of the Fourth Amendment.

24

QUESTION:

25

The

Is that your answer to Justice

Kennedy, that there would be jurisdiction because due

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

process would require it for citizens, but there

2

would not be statutory jurisdiction in the case of

3

the citizen at Guantanamo?

4

GENERAL OLSON:

I think it would be an

5

interpretation.

6

interpreting the statute because the Habeas Corpus

7

Statute defines the extent of rights --

8
9

And what this Court is doing is

QUESTION:

Well, but what is the

position -- I mean, I want to know what the position

10

of the United States is for the same reason Justice

11

Kennedy does.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

Our answer to that

13

question, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the

14

United States, because of their constitutional

15

circumstances, may have greater rights with respect

16

to the scope and reach of the Habeas Statute as the

17

Court has or would interpret it.

18

come before this Court, and it's important to

19

emphasize that --

20
21

QUESTION:

That case has never

You go outside of the statutory

language for your case that's in front of us.

22

GENERAL OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Justice --

You are going outside of the

24

statutory language to resolve both the hypothetical

25

case and the case in front of us.

This is a

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

prisoner, and he is detained under the authority of

2

the United States.

3

GENERAL OLSON:

And this Court construed

4

those provisions in the Eisentrager case and

5

determined that the statute did not reach aliens that

6

did have no contact with the United States and were

7

held in a foreign jurisdiction outside the

8

sovereignty of the United States.

9

QUESTION:

It did not construe the

10

statute.

11

concluded that the Constitution was not a substitute

12

for the statute.

13

It assumed the statute was inapplicable and

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, Justice Stevens, I

14

respectfully disagree.

15

construing the statute not to be applicable, then it

16

went on because the Court of Appeals had addressed

17

the constitutional question.

18

QUESTION:

I think the Court was

Not a word, not a word in the

19

opinion that supports it.

20

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I respectfully

21

disagree.

The Court does say, we don't find any

22

authority in the statute.

23

authority in the Constitution.

24

so-called fundamentals to find it someplace else.

25

That is consistent with what this Court decided in

QUESTION:

Well, it's obvious that there

3

is language in Eisentrager that supports you, obvious

4

to me, but you have just heard that judges don't

5

always distinguish between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), not

6

even in this Court, at least we don't always get it

7

right.

8

heard, that's against you.

9

there.

10

And there is also language, as you have
I think there is some in

So what I'm thinking now, assuming that

11

it's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if

12

we go with you, it has a virtue of clarity.

13

a clear rule.

14

States, you don't get your foot in the door.

15

against you is that same fact.

There is

Not a citizen, outside the United
But

16

It seems rather contrary to an idea of a

17

Constitution with three branches that the executive

18

would be free to do whatever they want, whatever they

19

want without a check.

20

That's problem one.

Problem two is that we have several

21

hundred years of British history where the cases

22

interpreting habeas corpus said to the contrary

23

anyway.

24

helping you with what you're really worried about,

25

which is undue court interference by shaping the

And then we have the possibility of really

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

substantive right to deal with all those problems of

2

the military that led you to begin your talk by

3

reminding us of those problems.

4

So if it's that choice, why not say, sure,

5

you get your foot in the door, prisoners in

6

Guantanamo, and we'll use the substantive rights to

7

work out something that's protective but practical.

8
9

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, Justice Breyer,

there are several answers to that.

You started with

10

the proposition that there was no check and that the

11

executive is asserting no check.

12

interpretation of the scope of a Habeas Statute.

13

Congress had -- has had 54 years with full awareness

14

of the decision to change it.

15

This is the

Indeed, as we point out in our brief,

16

eight months after the Eisentrager decision, a bill

17

was introduced that would have changed that statute,

18

H.R. 2812, which would specifically have changed the

19

statute to deal with the Eisentrager situation, so

20

there is a check.

21

QUESTION:

It could have been just a

22

clarifying, General Olson.

As you well know, the

23

fact that a bill was introduced and not passed

24

carries very little weight on what law that exists

25

means.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I understand that,

2

but the bill was -- came eight months after

3

Eisentrager.

4

QUESTION:

You're not using it to say what

5

the law was.

6

available, and is available, a perfectly good check

7

upon the executive branch.

8

this is unfair, if Congress thinks it's unfair, with

9

a stroke of the pen, they can change the Habeas

10
11

You're using it to show that there was

If the people think that

Statute.
GENERAL OLSON:

That's precisely correct.

12

And they had a bill before them eight months after

13

the Eisentrager decision which had -- that Congress

14

proceeded on it.

15

Habeas Statute in a variety of other ways.

16

seen fit in no way to change the decision required by

17

this Court with respect to the statute.

18

Congress has also dealt with the
It has

You mentioned several hundred years of

19

British history was your second point.

20

cases, or virtually all of those same cases that have

21

been brought up in the briefs, and the amicus briefs

22

today, were in the briefs that were before the

23

Eisentrager --

24
25

QUESTION:

I grant you this.

All of those

My question

has to assume that Eisentrager is ambiguous and not

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

clearly determinative.

2

I'm still honestly most worried about the fact that

3

there would be a large category of unchecked and

4

uncheckable actions dealing with the detention of

5

individuals that are being held in a place where

6

America has power to do everything.

7

But then on that assumption,

Now, that's what's worrying me because of

8

Article III, and the other thing on the opposite

9

side, as I said, is it's possible to tailor the

10

substance to take care of the problems that are

11

worrying you.

12

Those are my two basic points.

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, let me get back to

13

it again.

14

rejected in Eisen -- in the Eisentrager case.

15

Whether there is a check on the executive, there is a

16

Congressional check through the power of legislation,

17

through the power of oversight, through the power of

18

appropriations.

19

Those earlier cases were decided and

There is --

QUESTION:

Can we hold hearings to

20

determine the problems that are bothering you?

I

21

mean, we have to take your word for what the problems

22

are.

23

problems are, can we, in creating this new

24

substantive rule that we are going to let the courts

25

create.

We can't call witnesses and see what the real

Congress could do all that, though, couldn't

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

it?

2
3

GENERAL OLSON:

Congress could do all that

--

4

QUESTION:

If it wanted to change the

5

Habeas Statute, it could make all sorts of refined

6

modifications.

7

GENERAL OLSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, it could --

About issues that we know

nothing whatever about, because we have only lawyers

10

before us.

11

cross-examination, we have no investigative staff.

12

And we should be the ones, Justice Breyer suggests,

13

to draw up this reticulated system to preserve our

14

military from intervention by the courts.

15

We have no witnesses.

GENERAL OLSON:

We have no

Well, we would agree with

16

that and we would emphasize the point that stepping

17

across that line would be impossible to go back from

18

with respect to prisoners in the battlefield.

19

fact, the reply brief refers to the front lines in

20

Iraq, in a battle station in Iraq.

21

here about battlefield decisions and --

22

QUESTION:

In

We are talking

The battlefield, I might, since

23

-- all I mean by working out the substantive rights

24

is what Justice Harlan meant and what Justice Kennedy

25

meant in adopting Justice Harlan's view in Verdugo.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

And that really derives from the insular cases, and I

2

don't think it's something that requires witnesses

3

and reticulated whatever they are, tax cuts.

4

(Laughter.)

5

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, to the extent that

6

the Court would say, the executive, you must give a

7

military process because the Petitioners in this

8

case, first of all, demanded in their petition and

9

they would have a right to raise these issues to the

10

extent they have not backed off in this case, but

11

they demanded in their petition, their release,

12

unmonitored communications with counsel, cessation of

13

interrogations, evidentiary hearings.

14

QUESTION:

Wasn't it --

15

QUESTION:

Our, our doctrine would have to

16

be applied in the first instance by 800 different

17

district judges, I take it.

18

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, there is no question

19

that that is exactly right.

20

what the Petitioners are seeking is to oversee the

21

circumstances -- this is the language in their brief,

22

to oversee the circumstances of detention.

23

going to vary from case to case.

24
25

QUESTION:

And to the extent that

That is

General Olson, I have looked at

the reply brief, which is the last chance to say what

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

they mean.

2

those things, and certainly not asking to have a

3

lawyer there while these people are being

4

interrogated.

that our people are innocents.

GENERAL OLSON:

12

relief that I was articulating is what they asked for

13

in the first instance.

14

this Court, the next Petitioner doesn't have to say

15

well, I only want a process.

16

want -- now they are saying they only want an

17

executive branch process to review.

If they have jurisdiction in

And if they only

As we

QUESTION: But to go back to the

20

jurisdiction, so I understand really what your

21

argument is.

22

far as their jurisdiction is concerned, if we were

23

talking about -- if the people were prisoners on

24

Ellis Island or in Puerto Rico?

25

Would this be entirely different, as

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, we would.

Because we

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

are talking about territorial sovereign jurisdiction

2

of the United States.

Guantanamo is no different than existed in Lansberg

Prison and --

QUESTION:

What -- what exists in

Why is that, why is that

6

crucial?

7

the respective jurisdiction clause of 2241.

8

crucial under the Due Process Clause?

9

GENERAL OLSON:

Is it

It is, it is the line that

this Court drew and repeatedly articulated --

11
12

I mean, it's not crucial, I take it, under

QUESTION:

But why is it a good line?

I

mean, what is -- what is the justification?

13

GENERAL OLSON:

Because it is a line that

14

is, is -- has the virtue of what Justice Breyer was

15

talking about, of having relative certainty.

16

line that's defined by State to State relationships.

17

QUESTION:

Why does it have complete

18

jurisdiction?

19

Complete jurisdiction of satisfactory lines.

20

It is a

No one else has jurisdiction.

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, the complete

21

jurisdiction is a phrase in that lease, the lease

22

specifically says that ultimate sovereignty is

23

Cuba's.

24

--

25

It specifically says that the United States

3

GENERAL OLSON:

With respect -- the lease

4

restricts the ability of the United States to use

5

that property for only Naval or coaling purposes.

6

specifically says it may not be used for any other

7

purpose.

QUESTION:

General Olson, there is a whole

other issue in this case which you have not addressed

10

and I don't think your brief much addressed it.

There is also a claim of jurisdiction under Section

1331 in the Administrative Procedure Act.

13

14

that is?

brief.

16

Will you

I don't even see the APA cited in your

GENERAL OLSON:

What is cited in the

17

brief, and we explain that the President is not an

18

agency under the APA, that the United States military

19

with respect to operations and military operations

20

are specifically exempted by the APA.

21

QUESTION:

That goes to the merits.

22

GENERAL OLSON:

And that the fundamental

23

nature of what the Petitioners are seeking here is

24

the review of the nature and status of their

25

detention, which sounds in -- and is examined by this

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court repeatedly under the doctrine of habeas corpus.

2

And that there is no foundation.

3

that the way the briefs have been written, the

4

Petitioners don't even feel strongly about the APA

5

position.

6

In fact, I submit

What they are talking about, and why most

7

of their briefs explain, they are focusing on

8

fundamental habeas corpus as it existed throughout

9

the centuries.

What is important to emphasize here

10

with respect to all of these questions, with respect

11

to, well, how much control would there be, how much

12

control would there be in Guantanamo versus a place

13

in Afghanistan or another place --

14

QUESTION: No, I think Guantanamo, everyone

15
16

agrees, is an animal, there is no other like it.

17

closest would be the Canal Zone, I suppose.

18

GENERAL OLSON:

The

The Canal Zone was treated

19

differently by Congress.

21

and insular or unincorporated territory, applied laws

22

there, put a court there.

than the Canal Zone.

1

GENERAL OLSON:

Because it is -- because

2

it is a -- in the first place, the question of

3

sovereignty is a political decision.

4

remarkable for the judiciary to start deciding where

5

the United States is sovereign and where the United

6

States has control --

7
8
9

QUESTION:

It would be

The word is physical control,

power.
GENERAL OLSON:

We have that, Justice

10

Ginsburg, in every place where we would put military

11

detainees, in a field of combat where there are

12

prisons in Afghanistan where we have complete control

13

with respect to the circumstances.

14

QUESTION:

But those -- Afghanistan is not

15

a place where American law is, and for a century, has

16

customarily been applied to all aspects of life.

17

even protect the Cuban iguana.

18

bringing people from Afghanistan or wherever they

19

were brought to Guantanamo, we are doing in

20

functional terms exactly what we would do if we

21

brought them to the District of Columbia, in a

22

functional sense, leaving aside the metaphysics of

23

ultimate sovereignty.

We

We bring -- in

If the metaphysics of ultimate sovereignty

25

do not preclude us from doing what we have been doing

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

for the last 100 years, why is it a bar to the

2

exercise of judicial jurisdiction under the Habeas

3

Statute?

4

GENERAL OLSON:

The Court actually heard a

5

case, Neely vs. Henkel, in 1901, which specifically

6

addressed that, and held that the United States did

7

not have sovereignty for the enforcement of its laws

8

in Guantanamo.

9
10
11

And at that point --

QUESTION:

We've been doing a pretty good

job of it since then, am I right?
GENERAL OLSON:

With respect to a certain

12

area, a military base in Germany, a military base in

13

Afghanistan, the United States must have and does

14

exercise relatively complete control.

15

that's being made here today could be made by the two

16

million persons that were in custody at the end of

17

World War II, and judges would have to decide the

18

circumstances of their detention, whether there had

19

been adequate military process, what control existed

20

over the territory in which they were being kept.

21

What this is --

22

QUESTION:

Every argument

Are you saying that there is no

23

statutory regime that applies to Guantanamo which is

24

different from the statutory or legal regime that

25

applied to occupied territories after World War II or

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

indeed that applies to territory under the control of

2

the American military in Afghanistan or Iraq?

3

GENERAL OLSON:

There is a great deal of

4

differences in connection with every area over which

5

the United States has some degree of control.

6

degree of control that it has here is limited to

7

specific purposes in -- with respect to the
