ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
This Court held 17 years ago in Davis v.

12

Bandemer that a claim of partisan gerrymandering is

13

actionable under the Federal Constitution.

14

courts have since effectively overruled Bandemer by

15

requiring factual showings of plaintiffs in these cases

16

that are both impossible and, I submit, irrational.

17

result, the state -

18

But the lower

QUESTION: Well, do you - do you - do you think

19

the lower courts then didn't follow Bandemer?

20

Bandemer set a very, very high standard.

21

As a

I mean,

MR. SMITH: Well, the standard that I think was -

22

the proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you

23

show that your members of your party have been completely

24

disenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once

25

were in the South, or that - that your party has

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

effectively been banned.

2

here required that you show that you're being prevented

3

from registering to vote, from raising money, from

4

campaigning, from showing up at the polls.

5

The standard that was applied

Those kinds of constitutional violations don't

6

make sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering

7

claim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of

8

course, they never occur.

9

claim is justiciable, it doesn't make sense simultaneously

10

to require people to establish those kinds of independent

11

violations.

12
13

So if you're going to say the

QUESTION: Three of us in Bandemer thought the
claim was not justiciable.

14

MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and I would submit

15

to you that - that - that history suggests that - that it

16

- the Court should not go that direction, because -

17
18

QUESTION: I was thinking history showed that was
the way to go.

19

MR. SMITH: Well, what - what we've seen, Your

20

Honor, because of the - the fact that the lower courts

21

have effectively read - rendered -

22

QUESTION: They couldn't - they can't reach a

23

decision under that Bandemer standard.

24

So maybe the way to go is to just stay hands off these

25

things.

It's impossible.

1

MR. SMITH: Well, we've never had a - an

2

opportunity for the lower courts to actually apply a

3

standard that says when does the map become so unfair that

4

it's anti-democratic?

5

apply this shut-out standard, which doesn't allow any real

6

scrutiny of the map.

7

What they have done instead is

QUESTION: Let - let me tell you my concern with

8

- with fairness.

9

parliamentary history, begin with Walpole and go to

If - if you look at British

10

Disraeli and Gladstone and Pitt and Churchill, and then if

11

you come to this country and you think about Dirksen and

12

Cannon and Webster and Clay, I don't recall any of them

13

ever talking about this issue from a standpoint of

14

fairness.

15

Legislate - there's just no sources on which we could -

16

from - from which we can draw.

17

I don't know what I'm supposed to look to.

I would concede that what happens here is unfair

18

in some common - common parlance.

19

pretty raw.

20

what neutral standards ought to be.

22

compactness, but I just don't think we have a - a large

source on which to draw.

1

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, what we - what we

2

try to do is articulate a standard which is tied to the

3

basic democratic values that are at stake and to the - and

4

to the article I standard that says the people should

5

ultimately be deciding who's going to be representing them

6

in Congress, not the states.

7

from the constitutional -

8
9

The one thing that's clear

QUESTION: Well, since we're talking about
article I, it also says that the times, place, and manners

10

of holding elections for Senators and Representatives

11

shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature, but

12

the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such

13

regulations.

14

business.

15

That suggests to me it's none of our

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, this Court held in

16

Wesberry v. Sanders, and has since twice done - applied

17

that again, both in Cook v. Gralike and the - and in the

18

Term Limits case, that there are judicially enforceable

19

limits on the extent to which a state, in exercising the

20

procedural power to establish the times, places, and

21

manners of congressional elections, can create an uneven

22

playing field and attempt to try to dictate the outcome of

23

an election.

24
25

QUESTION: All right.

But then the problem is

that I think I have and others is, what are these

standards?

depart from historically drawn lines.

5

historically drawn lines themselves are random.

6

history.

7

whether or not the minority party might get the majority

8

of votes, but the minority of seats.

9

in the future, that depends how people vote in the future.

10

Now, you propose, one, look to the mind of the

Whether they might

There's no set of lines where you couldn't

11

imagine results that could come out that way.

12

we do it?

13

So how do

MR. SMITH: Your Honor, that's - with - with all

14

respect, I - I - first of all, we don't suggest that you

15

should somehow look at the departure from historical

16

lines.

17
18

That's not part of our QUESTION: You said look to see whether the

traditional criteria are predominantly ignored.

19

MR. SMITH: That's -

20

QUESTION: That's what I'm referring to.

21

MR. SMITH: Okay.

22

That's part of the intent -

yes.

23

QUESTION: I've read it.

MR. SMITH: Our - our standard on effects is that

I understand it.

this process.

As this Court recognized in Gaffney -

QUESTION: No, no.

I - my question is, how do

your standards possibly work?
MR. SMITH: The standard would be, under our -

5

under our submission, can you demonstrate that it is

6

absolute - that it is very clear that you could get more

7

than half the votes and have no chance.

8

QUESTION: Always can.

9

MR. SMITH: No.

10

QUESTION: You can't draw a set of lines such

11

that I couldn't imagine a voting pattern such that that

12

wouldn't happen.

13

MR. SMITH: But, you see, our standard is

14

precisely the opposite.

15

under any voting pattern, it would happen.

16

possibility that with more than half the votes you could

17

get anywhere near half the seats.

18

You have to show that it would There is no

QUESTION: You're - you're just pulling this -

19

you're just pulling this thing out of a hat, so to speak.

20

I mean, you've got phrases in the Constitution that

21

Congress may do it or the states may do it.

22

the Equal Protection Clause, which was - came into being,

23

you know, in 1868, not in the original Constitution.

24

they - they just don't intimate anything like what you're

25

talking about.

You've got

1

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, we - we focus on

2

this 50/50 point, this majoritarian standard for two main

3

reasons.

4

QUESTION: What - what -

5

MR. SMITH: One is a - is a matter of principle,

6

which is to say, when does consideration of politics go

7

too far?

8

democracy -

9

QUESTION: Well - well -

10
11

MR. SMITH: - we're having a minority party
control the majority of seats.

12
13

QUESTION: Well, when you say, you know, the the Constitution doesn't ever use the word democracy.

14
15

It goes too far when we're no longer operating a

MR. SMITH: Yes, but we - but we have a - we have
a -

16

QUESTION: Not to mention party.

17

QUESTION: Yeah.

18

MR. SMITH: We have a commitment though to the -

19

to the fact that the House of Representatives is supposed

20

to mirror the people and is supposed to be -

21

QUESTION: Well -

22

MR. SMITH: - representative of the people.

23

QUESTION: Well, you - but -

24

MR. SMITH: And we -

25

QUESTION: The - the - the Constitution

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

originally provided that the - the standard for the state

vote would be the standard for the Representatives in

3

Congress.

4

the states.

5

many years, so it didn't represent the people in that

6

sense.

7

And in other - it - it was simply left up to
And there were property qualifications for

MR. SMITH: The reason we are focusing on the

8

majority standard, the 50/50 standard, is in part because,

9

as this Court has recognized in Wesberry and it's

10

recognized in - in - in Cook and it's recognized in

11

Thornton, the states are not supposed to be deciding for

12

themselves who's going to be representing the people.

13

people are supposed to decide.

14

The

The second reason is that 50/50 you don't have

15

these problems of distortions, which, as an empirical

16

matter, happen in a winner-take-all, single-member

17

district system.

18

19

more than 60 percent of the districts.

20

don't - you don't ever want to have a rule of proportional

21

representation.

22

When you get to 60/40, the party that

presidential electors too, as we recently saw.

2

that we - we have here.

3

it includes two Senators are counted, two votes for the

Senators in every state across the board, so there - that

- that is the disparity between the popular vote and the

serious point.

20

Your Honor

QUESTION: Now, I've exposed the entire problem.
I want you to respond to it.
MR. SMITH: Your Honor, experts will in all

21

likelihood be involved as we - we have an example of the

22

kind of expert testimony that can be given here.

23

is not, to use another expression, rocket science.

24

Experts testify in voting rights cases about how districts

25

will behave.

But this

They use prior election returns plugged into

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those districts to make estimates about how they will

2

behave, and it'll be the burden on the plaintiffs to

3

establish - they have the burden of proof - that, in fact,

4

it is true that if you get - that - that the - this

5

favored party, with more than 50 percent of the vote, will

6

have essentially no chance of getting half the districts.

7

That is -

8

QUESTION: Were the experts on which you rely,

9

were they presented as witnesses in the district court?

10

MR. SMITH: We had a trial on the one person, one

11

vote claim, Your Honor, after the partisan gerrymandering

12

claim was defeated, was dismissed.

13

tried to justify the deviation by talking about neutral

14

principles that governed this map, and so we had the

15

opportunity to put a kind of preview of our partisan

16

gerrymandering evidence on -

17
18
19
20
21

And the - the state

QUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Smith, isn't it true that
what the issue is sufficiency of your complaint?
MR. SMITH: That's - that's correct, Your Honor.
At this point QUESTION: And may I ask you a question that -

22

that troubles me about the complaint?

23

complaint was drafted on the theory that you agreed with

24

Justice Powell's position in Bandemer, but the position

25

you've come up with in this Court is entirely different

It seems to me your

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and not the one that I read into the complaint.

2

majority analysis theory is - is really quite different

3

from - from that theory.

4

Justice Powell.

5

Your

You - you seem to have abandoned

And I - what I wanted to ask you is, under the

6

theory of the complaint, as opposed to the theory on which

7

you're arguing in this Court, if you were - you allege

8

that there were no neutral justifications whatsoever for

9

any district line.

And if you put in proof to that effect

10

and the - and the other side prove there were neutral

11

justifications for half the districts, say, but the - that

12

there were a half that did fit your allegations, would -

13

would - in your view, would the district court have the

14

authority to review the districts that were totally

15

unjustified without meeting your majority analysis claim?

16

MR. SMITH: I think the court does have to look

17

at the effects of the deviate - departures from

18

traditional district criteria -

19
20

QUESTION: Assume the effects, say you've got two
plaintiffs, one from district 6 and one from 16, I think.

21

MR. SMITH: Yes.

22

QUESTION: If, for example, the - the court

23

thought that district 6 had absolutely no justification,

24

it's wildly, you know, the shape is so terrible and so

25

forth, but the rest of the map was okay.

Under your

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

complaint, could the judge do anything about that?

2

MR. SMITH: I - I think it - the - certainly

3

under our complaint and under the - our conception of the

4

case, you don't look at one district in isolation and say,

5

this district is too ugly or too much of a departure -

6

QUESTION: I know your complaint is drafted as a

7

all-or-nothing, but I'm just wondering, within the -

8

within the allegations, would - would it be open to the

9

judge to say, well, they lose on the total picture, the

10

majority theory is - is just too - too novel for me, but

11

what they've said about district 6 pans out 100 percent.

12

Is that -

13

MR. SMITH: That - that's not our case, Your

14

Honor, and - and the reason for it is, I don't think that

15

this Court is going to come in and start imposing,

16

particularly districting criteria, when an ugly-looking

17

district -

18

QUESTION: In particular districts?

19

MR. SMITH: - an ugly-looking and odd -

20

QUESTION: They did that in the racial

21
22

gerrymandering context - situation.
MR. SMITH: Only when - only when it's talking

23

about race on either side of the line, and - and it could

24

be that the Court would ultimately get to the point of

25

saying a district that's too ugly and - and divides

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Democrats from Republicans ought to be viewed in the same

2

way.

3

But our submission is more like the racial vote

4

dilution case, that not only are there departures would

5

show partisan intent, but you have to look, as the Court

6

said in Bandemer, statewide and see whether, in fact, the

7

- the - the legislature has created a situation where a

8

Republican votes counts twice as much as a Democratic vote

9

in this state because -

10

QUESTION: Race does not change.

You - you are

11

the race you are, and you're not going to change it next

12

year.

13

how - how - how do you decide what, you know, what - what

14

is the Republican vote?

15

-

Political party doesn't work that way.

How do -

Is it just registered Republicans

16

MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor -

17

QUESTION: - and is everybody that's registered a

18

Republican now have to stay - maybe we should make them

19

stay registered Republicans so that we can have good

20

districts, right?

21

understand how you run this scheme.

22

tell until after the election is done how many Republicans

23

and how many Democrats there are in each district.

I mean, it - it - I just don't
You cannot really

24

MR. SMITH: Well -

25

QUESTION: Are - are you going to -

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH: - the way you identify -

2

QUESTION: - count on party registration?

3

that the basis for divvying it up?

4
5

Is

MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.

It's how people have

voted and how -

6

QUESTION: In the last election.

7

MR. SMITH: Yes.

And it - it would again be the

8

burden of the plaintiff to show that there are predictable

9

voting patterns, that there's a large chunk of people who

10

are consistent Democratic or Republican supporters who are

11

being injured in their voting rights by means of a - of a

12

deliberate scheme by the legislature.

13

Now, the idea that these people are hard to

14

identify is a little hard to square with a map, in which

15

you have these incredibly complicated peninsulas going out

16

to find -

17

QUESTION: Any particular election, they are very

18

hard to identify in any particular election, which is why

19

the parties go about selecting their candidates very

20

carefully.

21

any old body -

If it didn't make any different, they'd pick

22

MR. SMITH: What the evidence -

23

QUESTION: - and run them and - and you'd get all

24

of the same Republican and the same Democrat votes.

25

That's not the way the world works.

MR. SMITH: Well, what the plaintiff would have

2

to show in such a case is that there's a sufficiently

3

consistent pattern of voting in the state that a racial -

4

that a political gerrymander is possible and it has

5

occurred and it - and that it will - and that, in fact, in

6

the future there will be an injury to one class of voters

7

who have been packed into a small number of 90 percent

8

Democratic districts, while there's a much larger number

9

of relatively safe Republican districts.

10

Now, you can say that's not true or we can't

11

know it, but we all sit here knowing - know that's what

12

they did.

13

QUESTION: Mr. Smith -

14

QUESTION: Well, what is it -

15

QUESTION: To - to what extent - what - to what

16

extent, Mr. Smith, does your - does your theory depend on

17

the registration of the voters?

18

MR. SMITH: Registration might be an indication

19

of voting patterns, but our theory is - is you look at

20

voting patterns and decide in advance of the next

21

election, will there in fact be a - a situation where it's

22

impossible for - if the Democrats got half the votes or

23

the Republicans got half the votes, it would be impossible

24

for them to get close to half the seats.

QUESTION: The point is it -

2

QUESTION: - particular vice of - of

3

redistricting, just on the basis of politics?

4

did it on the basis of isolating or - or fracturing union

5

votes, or - or the gay vote or the environmentalist vote

6

or farm subsidies?

Suppose you

7

MR. SMITH: Well -

8

QUESTION: Where - where - where does your - your

9

- your principle particularly elect political parties?

In

10

- in - in fact, it seems to me that parties might - might

11

well conclude - include some of these groups that I've

12

mentioned.

13

MR. SMITH: This Court has - has made clear in a

14

number of cases that the Government has no business

15

discriminating against people based on their partisan

16

affiliation or their political viewpoint, in contracting,

17

in jobs.

18

that at some point, a level of discrimination in designing

19

the machinery of democracy, the electoral process itself,

20

a - a form of discrimination that's equivalent to saying,

21

in two-thirds of the district we're going to count all the

22

Republican votes twice, in one-third of the districts

23

we're going to count all the Democratic votes twice.

24

QUESTION: But certainly you allow for some

25

And it seems to us it would - it should be clear

discrimination?

I mean, that - that's the way

1
2

legislatures go at it.
MR. SMITH: Well, as this - this Court has made

3

clear, both in the race area and the politics area,

4

redistricting is a little different from other areas.

5

doesn't make any sense to demand purity and a complete

6

non-consideration of these factors, but there has to be an

7

outer boundary.

8
9

It

If there's no outer boundary, then -

QUESTION: Mr. - Mr. Smith, you're - you're
essentially asking how much is too much.

You say you have

10

this decision that said people have this claim that they

11

can bring, Bandemer.

12

line was, and you have no claim on the merits.

13

judge, a district judge, in - in one of these cases said,

14

well, here's the Indiana plan and the court said that that

15

was okay, and this one doesn't look any worse to me.

16

there a difference between the Pennsylvania plan and the -

17

a significant difference between those two?

18

MR. SMITH: There's a -

19

QUESTION: With our precedent, I mean, you have

But that was a case where the bottom
Now, if a

Is

20

to take the whole of it, not just half.

21

to sue you like, the bottom line, but the Indiana plan,

22

egregious as it may look, is okay.

23

The half standing

MR. SMITH: Well, the facts shown in the Indiana

24

case, in the Bandemer case, were much less severe than

25

those we alleged here, in terms of - here we had

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allegations which were ultimately supported by expert

2

testimony in the one person, one vote trial, that they

3

would get a large super-majority of the districts with

4

only half the - with half the votes or less.

5

And in - in Bandemer, the facts as they were

6

presented, there was no such expert analysis. Instead,

7

they relied on the results of one election in which one of

8

the bodies actually came out the right way and one of them

9

came out slightly the wrong way.

They had not supplied

10

the Court with the same kind of evidence that we would

11

propose to supply, and - and did not meet, at least as an

12

evidentiary matter, the standard that we propose here.

13

It might be that, in fact, if somebody looked at

14

that Indiana map, it might have met that, but nobody

15

studied it in that way.

16

it's really ugly, they've got these unfair, multi-member

17

districts in certain cities, and, in fact, the way the

18

vote came out in the House, the Democrats got more than

19

half the votes and got only 43 percent of the seats.

20

I - that, I submit, is not a sufficient basis to establish

21

the outer boundary that we would suggest you have to meet.

22

They were simply saying, look,

That

QUESTION: But if you're going to say it's not

23

fair, fairness in what sense?

24

draw lines that will pack and crack one party or another,

25

you're going to end up with no geographical boundaries,

If we say it's not fair to

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

because all geographical boundaries do that.

A random

system in Pennsylvania would give the Democrats no

Representatives -

4

MR. SMITH: What -

5

QUESTION: - purely random.

6

MR. SMITH: Well, that's -

7

QUESTION: So - so it's, I mean, my point is that

8

politicians and the public, in fact, in form has one idea

9

of what's fair and it's very hard for a judge to turn that

10

idea into judicially administrable rules.

11

MR. SMITH: Your Honor, with - with respect, I -

12

I think that it is perfectly possible for somebody to look

13

at a map and decide whether or not it does or does not

14

unfairly discriminate against one of the political

15

parties.

16

frequently.

17

in Pennsylvania that was -

They collect testimony from experts, the map

QUESTION: You - you can tell whether it

19

discriminates against one political party, I guess on the

20

basis of - of - of projections that may turn out to be

21

wrong.

22

can say, what you can guess about, is simply that it will

23

favor one party over another, yes.

24

easy to tell that it will unfairly favor one party over

25

another?

You -nobody can say for sure.

But what - what you

But - but is it so

And that's what you're arguing here.

How unfair is unfair?

I don't know.

What is

it, 60/40?

3

MR. SMITH: If it gets to the point where one

4

party's getting two-thirds of the seats with less than

5

half the votes, in a democracy, I submit that's the place

6

where it crosses the line.

7

QUESTION: Okay.

Mr. Smith, you - is - is that

8

the - the - the force of your argument, I take it, is not

9

that this happens in one electoral year, because there may

10

be all sorts of reasons.

11

is, it happens over time.

12

MR. SMITH: It -

13

QUESTION: Let's - let's - let me start with that

It's something, your argument

14

assumption.

15

which we - we come up with a wait-and-see rule, and we

16

say, it's not enough for you to prove a - a violation to

17

predict in advance.

18

violation by looking back and establishing through the

19

course of three or four elections that - that this pattern

20

is emerging.

you win.

Let's assume that we come up with a rule in

You've in fact got to prove a

And let's assume we say, if you can do that,

My question, which then goes to the substance of

23

what you're going to win, and ultimately the substance of

24

what your claim must be is, what is the principle that the

25

district court must apply in a case like that to reform or

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

- or redraw the districts?

Does he - does he come up with

2

a principle that says anything that follows traditional

3

redistricting principles, you know, compactness, et

4

5

problem.

That won't necessarily solve your

Has he got to come up with a scheme that says

7

there's a presumption that all districts have got to be

8

competitive?

9

break with tradition because there are loads of places

If he does that, there's going to be a clear

10

where you can't have competitive districts.

11

principle on which he's going to reform it?

12

What is the

MR. SMITH: Well, let - let - I will - let me

13

directly answer that question in a moment, but let me just

14

comment.

15

wait three or four election cycles to - to prove your

16

case, it would essentially be - mean that the claim is

17

worthless, because you're going to redraw the districts

18

every 10 years, and there's an enormous amount of

19

irreparable harm, as you suggest.

I think the idea of a rule that says you have to

20
21

QUESTION: Two elections.

22

MR. SMITH: As you suggest, there's already

23

irreparable harm.

incumbents of the disfavored party, they have new

25

incumbents that have come in now.

Once you've thrown out all the

It doesn't mean that

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you can't have a remedy, and it would seem to me the very

2

first thing you'd want to do, just as you do in a race

3

case under section II is - is have a map which does not

4

inherently pack and crack the disfavored group to the

5

point where they don't have the opportunity to -

6

QUESTION: The - the trouble is, in the race

7

case, you have a relatively simple objective in mind.

8

that is, the relatively simple objective is that once you

9

identify the political party of the racial voter, the

10

minority voter, that minority voter ought to have, in

11

effect, the same opportunity as a non-minority voter of

12

that political party.

And

13

Here, we have a different problem.

14

force or power that a member of a given political party

15

ought to have?

16

What is the

It's not as simple as the race case.

MR. SMITH: Well, I think the inquiry would

17

essentially be the same though.

18

have to come with the remedial map, the - presuming the

19

legislature would have an opportunity to draw on in the

20

usual situation, in which they could show that it is no

21

longer the case that there is such packing and cracking of

22

Democrats that - that at 50 percent, they would have no

23

chance of getting 50 percent of the seats.

24
25

They - the parties would

QUESTION: What - what if you have more than two
parties?

with that.

MR. SMITH: Well, the -

8

QUESTION: Each proportional representation for

9

each of the parties?

10

MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.

The - the - the test

11

we're talking about here is - is if one of the parties

12

would get to 50 percent, would they have an opportunity to

13

- to have a majority of the delegation?

14

QUESTION: Do you take into account at all in -

15

in this picture, this is not something that could have

16

been adopted by the Republicans in the state legislature

17

alone.

it through.

It took quite a number of Democratic votes to put

19

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -

20

QUESTION: Is that - is that relevant?

21

MR. SMITH: It - it might be relevant at trial if

22

we ever get to trial.

23

would attempt to show at trial, and I think we would show

24

at trial, is first of all, not a single Democratic Senator

25

voted for it.

Our claim was dismissed.

What we

There were some Democratic House Members

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

who voted for it, and the reason for that is because there

2

are five Members of Congress who are Democrats in the

3

State of Pennsylvania who are real, real happy with the

4

districts they got.

5

And the General Assembly, the Republican

6

leadership said, well, if you guys want these districts,

7

you know what - you know what the price you have to pay

8

for, you need to get us some votes.

9

dynamics that take place, and in any partisan gerrymander

So that - there are

10

there's going to be some really good districts for the

11

disfavored party, just not enough, not - not a fair - fair

12

allocation, not one that would allow the party to have a

13

majority control.

14

QUESTION: Mr. Smith, over a period of years, can

15

you identify any state where your test of partisan

16

gerrymandering has persisted over a period of time, five

17

years or more?

18

it's persisted over a period of years?

19

Can you give us examples of states where

MR. SMITH: I'm not sure that I - that I have

20

enough knowledge of political history going back decades

21

to be able to tell you whether that's the case or not.

22

certainly will persist through a decade as long as the

23

whole leadership of the state doesn't shift over to the

24

other party, as long as the party that committed the - the

25

crime, so to speak, maintains either the governorship or

2

QUESTION: Because in how many states do we have

3

a situation currently where both houses of the legislature

4

and the Governor are of one political party?

5

MR. SMITH: There's quite a number of states,

6

including, as it happened in - in this round, a number of

7

very competitive states, the - which caused quite a - had

8

quite a consequential impact on the Congress, Florida,

Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and now more recently, Texas

10

has come into play and decided to play this game.

that over any period of time that condition wouldn't

MR. SMITH: Which, in order to fix the problem,

17

once it already exists, you have to get both houses and

18

the governorship back to - to pass a second bill.

19

Otherwise, it's in place for the 10 years and then what

20

also happens in most states is the state legislatures, of

21

course, gerrymander themselves as well as the - the

22

congressional seats, in order to keep themselves in a

23

position where 10 - 10 years hence they'll still be around

24

and in control of the process again.

So there is a - a fundamental - fundamentally

anti-democratic part of this, which means in - in the long

run, you are - you do have very competitive states with

extremely skewed congressional delegations.

15

MR. KRILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
Because politics is inherent in redistricting,

16

any test, including the appellants' proposed test in their

17

reply brief, requires inherent political choices to be

18

made, choices that we submit are inappropriate for the

19

judiciary to make.

20

Appellants' latest test, for example, has hidden

21

political choices in it that are outcome determinative.

For example, they use 10 years of statewide races rather

than using a single base race, as recommended by the

and so forth.

And supposing the evidence shows that no neutral criteria

at all were used except let's do the best we can to help

Let's assume that them - that their theory

MR. KRILL: No, Your Honor.

The legislative process is so complex.

Every

the allegation, said just district 6 or district 16 was

clearly drawn for this purpose and no other, no neutral,

18

no effort to be compact or contiguous or follow boundary

19

lines or rivers or anything, we just want to get the

21

that was permissible?

22

Would you say

MR. KRILL: It - yes, I would, Your Honor.

And -

23

and I would also say that it - it is not only impossible

24

to prove at trial, but improper to even attempt to prove

at trial, because - and we'll - let's take district 6 in

Because it would require

inquiring into the legislative process in violation of

legislative privilege.

4

QUESTION: No, it would just -

MR. KRILL: Legislators are pulled in a million

6

directions.

7

QUESTION: It would just say to the - when you

8

have a - a really strangely distorted district, the burden

9

is on you to point out one neutral justification for it,

10

and we'll assume that if you - you won't have to go into

11

the minds of the legislature, just assume there is

12

something we can point to, such as a boundary line or if

13

it's fairly compact or it's - but you can't point to

14

anything.

15

just say - you give them the opportunity to explain, and

they - they say, well, we have no explanation.

Now, we have three things - three requirements

there that really are designed to police the outer fringe.

6

And if I start with that assumption of what the

7

Constitution wants, why don't I say it imposes those three

8

requirements?

9

MR. KRILL: All right.

Accepting your

10

assumption, Justice Breyer, I - first of all, I - I think

11

that one would have to look at a lot of different things.

12

The appellants' test, for example, assumes that Democrats

are evenly disbursed across the state -

the reverse.

The same thing happened again in a -

You know, the Democrats and Republicans

So it - it can, in fact, happen, Your Honor.

7

But if you allow the experts to control over the voters,

8

then you'll never know the truth of what would really

9

happen.

And let me give you an example in Bandemer

10

itself.

The aftermath of - of the Bandemer case in

11

Indiana is instructive, because two years after this Court

12

handed down its decision in Bandemer, the Democrats, who

13

would have had the Court believe that they were consigned

14

to an eternity of Republican tyranny, actually won 50

15

percent of the state House seats in Indiana.

16

years after that, in 1990, they won control, and control

17

has flipped back and forth ever since in Indiana.

And only two

So, I believe that Justice O'Connor's concurring

opinion in Bandemer was - was quite on point.

22

recommends, actually gives a lot of weight to the past

preferences of voters, dead voters, voters who have moved.

Naturally, this is a political choice, because any party

25

that perceives this influence as waning over time will ask

They also use high profile offices in choosing

their races instead of low-profile statewide races, non-

recommends.

Nothing could be more non-charismatic.

QUESTION: Unkind of you to say it, sir, unkind
of you.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. KRILL: And, of course, it - they've made a

12

political choice in not using those races either, because

13

in 2001, the year that our legislature was considering

14

this plan, the Republicans took seven out of seven

15

statewide appellate races.

16

mentioned, in their test assumed dispersion of Democrats

17

uniformly, when, in fact, Democrats, as we all know, are

18

compacted, self-compacted, into urban areas.

19

the test is very tilted.

20

They also, as - as - as I

So, the -

A curious thing that they do in their test is

turn real races into hypothetical races by normalizing

them so as to remove the popularity factor from those

MR. KRILL: - principles.

2

QUESTION: - before you reach remedy is whether

3

there's a violation.

4

MR. KRILL: Yes.

5

QUESTION: And his theory basically was, there's

6

a violation if there are certain wildly - wildly-defined

7

districts that have no neutral justification except to

8

give partisan advantage to the people who had the power to

9

draft them and who did not even consult the adversary

10
11
12
13

party in drafting them.

That was his standard.

MR. KRILL: Well, that's impossible to prove and
improper to prove.

For example -

QUESTION: It's a matter of burden-shifting, and

14

if they can't come up with any explanation whatsoever

15

other than partisan advantage, that that's a violation of

16

the - of the duty to govern impartially.

17

is no such duty or it is a violation.

18

require individual legislators to come in and say, here's

20

why I voted.

21

Here's - here's the - here's the -

QUESTION: Well, do you think - do you think it's

However, I - I think -

QUESTION: Well, I mean, do you have to be a

really tricky, astute, very clever fact-finder to figure

out what was going on here?

MR. KRILL: Well, yes you would, in fact.

In

QUESTION: But again, under Justice Powell's
standard, they wouldn't have to do that.

13

MR. KRILL: No.

14

QUESTION: They would just have to say, this is

15

totally irrational unless you can come up with an

18

MR. KRILL: That - that's correct.

Now, voters -

they would have to believe -

from the question of remedy, as though, you know, we'll -

QUESTION: Of course, I guess if there are five

different criteria: compactness, past practice, or

QUESTION: That's a - that's true, and the only
judicial call is you've got to use at least one.

7

MR. KRILL: Well, but - but by saying that - by

designating them as neutral criteria, the judiciary itself

3

MR. DeLONE: Because, Your Honor, in the Shaw

4

Line of cases, what they were doing is they were trying to

5

isolate race from all other factors, including politics.

6
7

QUESTION: And in here, we're trying to - to
isolate being a Democrat or being a Republican -

8

MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your -

9

QUESTION: - from all other factors, because

10

after all, as Justice Stevens pointed out, they've been

11

able to come up with no explanation other than we did it

12

because they're Democrats.

13

MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor -

14

QUESTION: That's what the word predominate means

15

-

16

MR. DeLONE: Right.

17

18

MR. DeLONE: But, but Your -

19

QUESTION: - just as you do insist on the

20

predominant showing in the race case.

21

MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, assuming that to be

22

correct, there's nothing wrong with them saying, we did it

23

just because they're Democrats.

24
25

QUESTION: Ah, yes, there is, because what's
wrong with it is if you carry it to an extreme with

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

securing the majority of seats.

that the majority should govern is the basic principle of

democracy.

just as wrong.

And that simple principle

So if you find that in the Constitution, it's

MR. DeLONE: Well, I think you have to - you have

to look at what majority you're talking about, Your Honor.

If - in a districting system, you're talking about the

or she's a Democrat?

MR. DeLONE: Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that

So you can't tell from

6

the Republican votes how many of those are Republican

7

votes and how many of them are, you know, Smith votes or -

8
9

MR. DeLONE: Exactly right, Your Honor, and
that's why the idea of comparing any sort of statewide

10

vote with the districting votes that you actually have is

11

inconsistent with -

12

QUESTION: Even if that's true, is it not obvious

13

from the configuration of some of the districts, that

14

those who drafted the districts thought they could predict

15

what they were going to do?

16
17

MR. DeLONE: Again, Your Honor, assuming that
that's correct, there's nothing wrong with it.

18

QUESTION: Oh, okay.

19

MR. DeLONE: And as far as the - the - what level

20

you come to in a - in a majority/minority consignment,

21

Justice Breyer, I think the way that the Bandemer

24

by which I mean the Whitcomb v. Chavis line of cases, is

25

22

That it can be done solely for the

MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.

That's

23

permissible, and we think that was the whole point of what

24

we call the racial gerrymandering line of cases, that is,

25

the Shaw Line of cases, where they were saying, okay, we

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have a special category here that relates to race, and

2

what we're trying to do is define the difference between

3

race, which is inherently suspect, and which requires

4

special scrutiny, and politics, which the Court repeatedly

5

said -

6

QUESTION: But if you take that position, then

7

you must be taking the position, I guess you are, that the

8

- the holding in Bandemer that this was a just -

9

justiciable issue is just erroneous?

10

MR. DeLONE: Your Honor, we think that -

11

QUESTION: That's your basic position?

12

MR. DeLONE: We certainly think that the Court

13

should take this opportunity to find that - that - that

14

political gerrymandering is non-justiciable.

15

that would be the simplest and the cleanest way to frankly

16

get out of the political thicket.

17

We think

But - but even if you don't do that, what - what

18

the Bandemer plurality was doing was simply applying what

19

this Court has - has always applied with respect to vote

20

dilution.

21

opinion.
MR. DeLONE: No, no.

Yes, Your Honor, I - I - I

8

think it would, because Justice Powell thought in terms of

9

neutral districting criteria and thought there was some

10

objective reality out there.

11

there is one, and if you start down the road of electoral

12

results, we submit that -

13

QUESTION: No, no.

And frankly, we don't think

He doesn't start down the

14

road of electoral results.

15

that it's an intent to use nothing except a non-neutral

16

criterion in drafting the regulations.

17

suggesting that's permissible.

18

counting votes after the election.

19

He - he focuses on intent,

And you're

That would not require

MR. DeLONE: With respect to intent, Your Honor,

20

we - we think it - it's - you certainly can assume that

21

there was political intent in a - in a political

22

gerrymander -

23

QUESTION: And nothing else.

24

MR. DeLONE: It - it certainly could be nothing

25

else, Your Honor.

QUESTION: So is this a - an intent of a bare
majority or all of them?

3

What - what - what if -

MR. DeLONE: Well, I think you can presume that

4

as - as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, 42 of 98 in the

5

Democratic caucus voted for the plan.

6

presume that they were in some way -

7

QUESTION: You can only - that's a matter of

defense.

at the complaint.

10
11

You can't presume that based on the allegations

MR. DeLONE: No, I - I was trying to address
Justice Scalia's question about -

12
13

I think you can

QUESTION: I'm trying to get to how you - how you
determine intent.

14

MR. DeLONE: Well, I - I -

15

QUESTION: Or whether it's based on the majority

16

or -

17

MR. DeLONE: I - I think you can presume that

18

whatever the voting, there was some political motivation,

19

and I think you can presume that the political motivation

20

might be different for different groups, different

21

parties.

22

a problem with the intent -

23

And - and frankly, we - we don't - we don't have

QUESTION: Belling the cat.

I mean, it's

24

wonderful to use intent.

25

- legislative intent is very hard to determine.

How do you find intent?

That's

1

MR. DeLONE: And - and - and I think the intent

2

would be - would different.

3

assume that it's political -

4

But it's - you can even

QUESTION: Well, how did you find it in the - in

5

the first racial gerrymandering case?

6

partly by looking at the shape of that district in North

7

Carolina?

Didn't you find it

8

MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION: Didn't that shift the burden?

10

MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, you did.

11

the - in the racial gerrymandering cases, you were looking

12

for something that was race-neutral.

13

But in

QUESTION: You were also looking for predominant

14

motive, not what the exclusive motive is, which is the

15

test that Justice Stevens is - is proposing.

16

MR. DeLONE: That - that's correct, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION: The - the exclusive motive just is

18

easier to respond to, because all you got to do is come up

19

with one neutral justification and you use the neutral

20

justifications that the Court identified itself in the

21

racial gerrymandering cases, such as contiguity and

22

compactness and so forth.

23

MR. DeLONE: But again, Your Honor, your - your -

24

the premise of your question is that there's something

25

wrong with political motivation.

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: Correct.

That's exactly right.

No,

2

no, the premise of the - what the question is that there's

3

a duty to govern impartially, and that if you have no duty

4

except partisan advantage, the case is just like saying,

5

we're going to pay the majority legislatures a higher

6

salary than the minority legislatures.

7

MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, I - I think that

8

when you're - when you're dealing with a - a political

9

question like districting, you're - you're - I think no

10

political party worth its salt is going to be - not think

11

it's - it's doing what's in the public interest to give

12

itself as much advantage as possible.

13

QUESTION: It can do that as long as it has some

14

other basis for doing it, and that's history what we did

15

over years and years and years, states have followed an

16

attempt to get compact districts, your neighbors are in

17

the same voting area as you are and so forth, not these

18

fancy designs that are really a recent product of

19

politics.

20

MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, in - in all of

21

these traditional districting criteria, they're basically

22

used as tools by the political parties to seek what kind

23

of political advantage they can.

24

that that is - is - there's nothing wrong with that.

25

the question is whether or not you've been shut out of the

process, whether something else is happening that suggests

2

that the - the process itself is broken.

And if you -

3

QUESTION: For example, what would that be?

4

MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, it's - it's

5

happened in the past.

6

Reynolds and Baker, and it's happened with -

It's - it's - it's happened with

7

QUESTION: But that isn't gerrymandering.

8

MR. DeLONE: No, it isn't, but it's the kind of

9

breakdown -

10
11

QUESTION: You're saying there's no
gerrymandering unless there's something else.

12

MR. DeLONE: Yes.

13

QUESTION: Which is to say there's no such thing

14

as cognizable political gerrymandering, period.

15

MR. DeLONE: I - I think what the Bandemer

16

plurality was trying to do was to leave the door slightly

17

ajar for something that, frankly, in our political system

18

is too resilient to - to allow to happen, but it's

19

conceivable that it could happen.

20

that it's strange to try and change the - the standard,

21

which is well established in this Court's jurisprudence,

22

just because the political system doesn't allow it to

23

occur.

24
25

And frankly, we think

And we think that once you go down the road of
electoral results, you go down the road of

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

proportionality. And the - the references that - that

2

appellants' counsel keep making to majorities are

3

statewide majorities, and that is proportionality.

4

is a political judgement, and we believe that the Court

5

has properly rejected that and the Court should continue

6

to apply the unconstitutional vote dilution standard and

7

that that - if - if they find that it's justiciable at

8

all, and that the easiest and simplest thing for the Court

9

to do is to find that political gerrymandering is in fact

10

unconstitutional - excuse me, non-justiciable as a matter

11

of law.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Let me

17

start off by saying I do think that our complaint

18

satisfies the standards of the Powell opinion in - in

19

Bandemer that it alleges that partisan maximization was

20

the sole driving force behind this map.

21

had the opportunity in the district court, because of the

22

one person, one vote problem, for the state to come in and

23

try to come up with some justification for their line-

24

drawing other than partisan maximization, and the district

25

court found as a fact in that trial that the map

jettisoned every criterion that this Court ever identified

in Karcher, other than partisan maximization.

3

QUESTION: I take it the results you're urging on

4

us would require us to supervise local entities, city

5

councils, boards of supervisors -

MR. SMITH: They -

7

QUESTION: - water districts.

8

MR. SMITH: They - they - they as well can

11

violate the constitutional rights of the people who live
in those jurisdictions, Your Honor.
And let me just address the - the question of

12

whether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections

13

come out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti­

14

majoritarian effect from the line-drawing.

15

real practical problems with that is that the lines

16

themselves in a - in an extreme gerrymander like this, can

17

- can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals

18

themselves.

One of the

You saw that right here where, in - with the

20

history of votes very evenly divided in a - in a balanced

21

map through the '90s, a court-drawn map.

23

unopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents

24

defeated in the primaries because they squared off -

rule, the party could adjust and try to run strong

2

candidates, even in overwhelmingly Republican districts.

3

MR. SMITH: Well, I suppose that that is in fact

4

the case, but you can't assume that the - the vote totals

5

under a gerrymander are independent of the effects of

6

that.

7

just not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial

8

distortion caused by the map.

First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're

There was some discussion by Mr. Krill of

10

judicial races as the - the test of - of partisan balance

11

in the map because the - the supposition was that judges,

when they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I

guess.

15

Mr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes

16

statewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts.

17

is an indication of the basic fundamental packing and

18

cracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of

severe discrimination, making some voters' votes count

much more forcefully than others.
