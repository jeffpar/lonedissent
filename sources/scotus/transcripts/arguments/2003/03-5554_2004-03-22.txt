ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. DOLAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DOLAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DOLAN:

13

it please the Court:

14

Am I pronouncing your client's name

Your Honor, it's Hiibel.
Hiibel.

Very well.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

I'm here today to respectfully ask this

15

honorable Court to find that the search and seizure of my

16

client was illegal and unreasonable and, in the process,

17

to reverse my client's conviction.

18

Petitioner Hiibel was arrested and convicted of

19

a crime simply because he did not identify himself or

20

provide identity.

21

QUESTION:

Could the officer have just said,

22

show me your driver's license?

23

MR. DOLAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DOLAN:

We don't believe so, Your Honor.
Why?
This was not a traffic stop.

This

was a -- an interaction between a pedestrian and a law

2

enforcement officer, wherein the officer -­

3

QUESTION:

But there was evidence -- was it not

4

clear that he had been driving and he got out of his

5

vehicle?

At the time the officer saw him, he was out.

MR. DOLAN:

7

finding of fact on that issue.

8

the trier of fact in the justice of the peace court there

9

in Winnemucca was whether or not the -- the charge of

11
12

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

What was the factual situation?

He

-- he was certainly right next to a truck, wasn't he?

13

MR. DOLAN:

Yes.

When Deputy Dove arrived at

14

the scene, Mr. Hiibel was standing at the passenger side

15

of the car.

16

the -- the steering wheel.

17

on the scene, he began the police-citizen encounter with

18

Mr. Hiibel.

19

said, I heard that there was some kind of a fight.

20

Hiibel said, I don't know anything about that.

21

Dove then proceeded to ask approximately 11 times for Mr.

22

Hiibel to provide identification.

His daughter was in the cab of the truck by

asked for his driver's license?

1

MR. DOLAN:

No, Your Honor.

I don't believe

2

that there was any reasonable basis for that question at

3

that time.

4

QUESTION:

Well, because the officer had been

5

told that in a truck -- in that truck somebody was hitting

6

somebody.

7

MR. DOLAN:

Well, we believe that the deputy

8

certainly had the right to ask for identity and -- and we

9

think equally so Mr. Hiibel was free not to respond.

10

QUESTION:

I see.

What -- what do you think the

11

purpose of our -- of our Terry -- of our Terry decision

12

is?

13

suspicious circumstances, he can stop that person and

14

inquire to satisfy himself that nothing -- nothing

15

underhanded is going on.

16

questions can he ask that -- that must be answered?

17

at all?

I mean, it says that when an officer sees somebody in

Now, what -- what kind of
Any

The -­
He -- he can't even ask the name you

say.

MR. DOLAN:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor -­
Can he ask what -- what are you doing

23

here if he sees somebody hanging around a jewelry store at

24

2:00 a.m. and -- and so he -- he conducts a Terry stop?

25

What -- what can he ask the fellow?

What are you doing

2

doesn't have to tell the officer what he's doing here.

3

I mean, if he can't give his name, surely he

MR. DOLAN:

Well, we -- we certainly believe

4

that under the Fifth Amendment a person has no obligation

5

to respond to -- to that officer.

6

never knows whether or not the encounter is a consensual

7

encounter where he certainly has no obligation to speak or

8

do anything.

The -- the citizen

Terry stop.

12

13

evolve into a probable cause circumstance -­

14
15

Certainly the citizen doesn't know that.

QUESTION:

MR. DOLAN:

QUESTION:

18

MR. DOLAN:

It hasn't evolved.

It was just a Terry stop.

No, it hasn't.

Just a Terry stop.
And you say -­
The officer is allowed to make -­
He's allowed to ask questions, but he

shouldn't expect answers.
MR. DOLAN:

We certainly don't believe that the

government can criminalize the non-response which the

23

statute in this case does, Your Honor.

The

QUESTION:

Well, in a Terry stop, when the

officer is attempting to make a patdown, can the person

1

resist it?

2

MR. DOLAN:

Not lawfully.

I believe that the

3

Court certainly allows, if there is independent basis to

4

conclude that the officer -- that the subject is armed,

5

the officer is lawful in using force to apply a patdown

6

search.

7

a basis for a criminal prosecution.

And if a person resisted that, then that would be

8
9

QUESTION:

You take the position, as I

understand your brief, that the purposes of criminal

10

investigation simply do not extend to asking for the names

11

of witnesses, as -- as I understand you.

12

a -- a bank robbery and -- and there's a fatal shooting

13

and the robbers run out of the bank.

17

which would require the witnesses to give their names?

18

Suppose there's

The police come a

Can they ask -- can they require the

MR. DOLAN:

Can there -- could there

We don't believe so, Your Honor.

We

19

believe that the relation to the State that free citizens

20

have prevent the State from imposing obligations,

21

affirmative obligations, to terminate the citizen-police

22

encounter.

23

QUESTION:

Is your -- is your -- your negative

24

answer to my question premised on the Fifth Amendment or

25

some privacy concept?

1

MR. DOLAN:

The -- yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

2

privacy concept that the Fourth Amendment addresses

3

certainly allows a person to be free from an illegal

4

search.

5

to extract data from a person without probable cause, it

is improper.

11

MR. DOLAN:

Your Honor, the -- the name is not

neutral, certainly in this domestic battery Terry stop,

13

because the name itself -­

14

QUESTION:

Well, I think one's -- one's name

15

probably is just a neutral fact.

16

MR. DOLAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Certainly there

2

are numerous investigative tools available to the police,

3

including running the license plate.

Dove -­

In fact, Deputy

QUESTION:

Well, he does that.

QUESTION:

You -- you -­

QUESTION:

He does that and the person is -­

8

QUESTION:

You can ask -- you can ask if he's

9
10

the owner of the car, the registered owner of the car, but
you can't ask him his name?

11

MR. DOLAN:

Well, we certainly believe that had

12

that been the facts in the case and Mr. Hiibel chose not

13

to respond, there would not be a basis that's proper under

14

the law for a criminal prosecution in that regard, Your

15

Honor.

16
17

QUESTION:

Yes, but I thought -- no.

You were

going to say something.

18

QUESTION:

That's all right.

Go ahead.

19

QUESTION:

I -- I thought your position was that

20

if it had been sufficiently apparent that Mr. Hiibel was

21

associated with the truck, that he owned it, had been

22

driving it or something like that, that under those

23

circumstances, the -- the police could have -- could have

24

exercised the State's regulatory power over motor vehicles

25

and said, show me your driver's license or show me your

3

Is that correct?

MR. DOLAN:

We believe that -- that that is the

law, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DOLAN:

6

QUESTION:

All right.
But this was not the case.
And you're saying the reason they

7

couldn't do any of those things here, in the sense of

8

demanding compliance, is that there wasn't a sufficient

9

connection shown between the -- the -- Mr. Hiibel and the

10

truck.

Is that what it boils down to?

11
12

MR. DOLAN:

Nor was it relevant at trial, Your

Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Oh, okay.

But I mean, we're talking

14

about the scene.

And at the scene, you're saying there

15

just wasn't a predicate for forcing him to answer those

16

questions.

17

Now --

18

MR. DOLAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And it

19

was -- it was not a fact that was deemed relevant by the

20

State at the time or the defense.

21

QUESTION:

Since -- and since there was not, I

22

take it your general position is that they can ask him

23

anything.

24

any question they ask.

It's -- it's unlawful to give a false response to a -- to

a perfectly reasonable responsibility of a citizen, when

12

he's a witness to the -- to a crime, to have to give his

13

name so that he may call -- be called upon to testify?

14

Why isn't that a minimal -- a minimal citizen's

15

responsibility and likewise in these circumstances?

16

cannot imagine that any responsible citizen would have -­

17

would have objected to giving the name.

18

if one feels that way about it, why is it a violation of

19

the Constitution to -- to have citizens do what every

responsible citizen, it seems to me, would do?

Your Honor, the imposition of an

MR. DOLAN:

Your Honor, the -- the name is in

fact testimonial because it is an assertion of fact, and

2

one can lie about one's name, and accordingly, I think -­

3

believe the test of what's testimonial or not is met.

4

It's also incriminating because if an officer

battery has occurred, that officer must arrest that

person.

QUESTION:

May I ask you this question that

MR. DOLAN:

Well, I don't -- I certainly think

20

that the State's case about the lawfulness of an arrest

21

and a conviction is -- is weaker for seizing a witness who

22

exercises their right to remain silent.

23

QUESTION:

But there are situations where the

24

State can -- that we -- well, Byers is one where we've

25

already said the name can be requested.

People are

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

required, when there's a registration for the draft, to

2

give their names which -- and that can't be made into a

3

consensual situation in exchange for some benefit.

4

we've treated names -- the question of name differently,

5

and there are many situations in which you are required to

6

give the name.

7

MR. DOLAN:

So

Well, Your Honor, as regards the

8

Byers case, that statute spoke of a regulatory scheme in

9

which the -- the identity, which was required to be given,

10

was not to a member of law enforcement.

It was to the

11

owner of a vehicle.

12

specifically contemplates that the dialogue occurs within

13

a criminal investigation in a Terry stop, which was

14

different from Byers certainly, and also the intent of the

15

statute in Byers was just to ensure that civil liabilities

16

would be satisfied.

17

QUESTION:

The Nevada statute in question

Well, in terms of the State's need to

18

know this information, how do you distinguish it from

19

requiring people to register, give their name for the

20

draft?

21

MR. DOLAN:

In this case, Your Honor, the -- the

22

name is testimonial and incriminating because of the

23

dynamic of the Nevada statute in question.

24
25

11

QUESTION:

The only thing Justice Scalia and I

12

are trying to get at is we thought you were saying at one

13

point that everyone has a Fifth Amendment to refuse to

14

identify himself under all circumstances, and that -- that

15

-- is that your position?

16

MR. DOLAN:

Your Honor, I -- the question is

17

only affirmative as regards the Fifth Amendment if the

18

State was to criminalize your silence in respect to that

19

question.

20

QUESTION:

Did the Supreme Court of Nevada pass

21

-- did you raise a Fifth Amendment question in the -- in

22

the Supreme Court of Nevada?

23

MR. DOLAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DOLAN:

We -- we did, Your Honor.
And did the court pass on it?
The court rejected the motion for

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

rehearing on that issue, Your Honor.

2
3

QUESTION:

Had you -- had you raised it before

the motion for rehearing?

4

MR. DOLAN:

Yes.

Your Honor, it was raised at

5

the trial level through the citation at the trial -- I was

6

the trial attorney -- to Berkemer v. McCarty.

7

appealed to the justice -- excuse me.

8

Sixth Judicial District Court where both the State and the

9

defendant specifically briefed the Fifth Amendment issues

10

We -- I

I appealed to the

and argued the Fifth Amendment issues.

11

QUESTION:

But -- but your answer that if -- if

12

the law requires that you give your name, then -- then

13

that makes everybody have a Fifth Amendment privilege is

14

just -- is just not right.

15

would agree that there may -- there likely is no Fifth

16

Amendment privilege for witnesses or I would -- I would

17

state that.

18

That's just circular.

I -- I

You might not agree.

As to people that are suspect of a crime, even

19

if they're innocent, if you're -- if you're right that the

20

name is protected, then I think the privilege -- that the

21

privilege applies because even if they're innocent, it

22

might be a link in the chain of evidence necessary to

23

convict.

24
25

That's the -- that's the test.
But the question, it -- it seems to me, is

whether a name itself -- a name itself is -- is -- has

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

such intrinsic testimonial consequences as opposed to

2

neutral regulatory consequences that it should be within

3

the Fifth Amendment.

4

MR. DOLAN:

5
6

That, it seems to me, the issue.
Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that's

where the Court will -- will turn on that question.
But also with respect to the Fourth Amendment

7

inquiry, a name is such that a person has a legitimate

8

expectation in the privacy in that name, otherwise the

9

government certainly then could require name tags and

10
11

perhaps color codes.
QUESTION:

But the question of whether or not is

12

that privacy is diminished when they're witnesses to a

13

crime when they're present at a crime scene, and that's

14

certainly much different from saying that all citizens

15

have to give their name anytime a police officer asks them

16

for any reason.

That's a completely different case.

17

MR. DOLAN:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
I'm not -- I'm not even sure that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONRAD HAFEN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6

8
9

MR. HAFEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There are three reasons why compelling a
lawfully detained person to identify himself is reasonable

10

under the Fourth Amendment.

11

It advances officer safety, and it promotes effective law

12

enforcement in the prevention and detection of crime.

13

Furthermore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment

14

privilege against self-incrimination because identifying

15

yourself is a neutral act.

16

QUESTION:

It is a minimal intrusion.

Now, that -- that goes beyond Byers.

17

My -- my -- the hard part of this case for me is that

18

Byers which, it seems to me, a much easier case, was so

19

difficult for the Court.

You had a fragmented Court.

You

20

didn't have an opinion for the majority of the Court.

And

21

this, it does seem to me, goes one step beyond Byers with

22

reference to the Fifth Amendment.

2

argument, but I -- I can't get that out of Byers.

3

It seems to me that's a plausible enough

MR. HAFEN:

Well, Your Honor, in regard to

4

Byers, it was a plurality opinion, but there was also a

5

strong concurrence by Justice Harlan.

6

particular case, they talk about stating a name and

7

address as being a neutral act, and in the same context,

8

they talked about it in regard to a testimonial situation.

9

They talk about it's a testimonial situation or a non­

And in that

10

testimonial situation when a person is stopped, the mere

11

stopping of the car, but in the same context, they also

12

say stating your name and your address is a neutral act.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I'll -- I'll look at it again,

14

but it seems to me even the Harlan opinion was in the

15

context of what we might call the regulatory zone of -- of

16

automobile -- automobile regulation and control.

17

MR. HAFEN:

They did talk about that, Your

18

Honor, but in the same context, they also describe or they

opinion addresses it in the criminal context, and Justice

21

Harlan also addresses it in the plurality -- or -­

QUESTION:

MR. HAFEN:

Well, in subsequent opinions that

were cited by the petitioner, they discuss the -- either a

dissent or a concurring, and in those particular

references, the Justice does say unsolved crimes,

And then I

that's what you're -- you're here to argue.

Even if it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment, we're

still going to have to answer the Fourth Amendment

question I guess.

25

MR. HAFEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

that's when the Court would engage in a balancing test.

But we have not expressly said that

MR. HAFEN:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
It is correct?

I'm sorry.

Not in a

holding, but I mean, there are about four cases where they

say, of course -- and of course, it's that.

12

you that dicta, which of course this is, is -- varies in

its strength and so forth, but if we have a repeated

pretty good reason for departing from it?

I'm listening for:

I'm just

The -- the language I quoted was while

MR. HAFEN:

That -- that's correct.

The Court

ultimately decided that a traffic stop was akin to a Terry

But the Court also addressed it in the situation of

11

a Fifth Amendment issue under a -- a Miranda concept.

QUESTION:

Well, I -­

Could you -- could you explain to us

14

why you think the Nevada Supreme Court didn't mention the

Fifth Amendment in its opinion?

MR. HAFEN:

Your Honor, I -- I don't know.

I am

17

of the opinion that the -- the opinion simply addresses

the Fourth Amendment issue.

20

issues were certainly presented to that court.

21

QUESTION:

Why they didn't address the
Those -- those

Because they're quite different, and

22

certainly the Fifth Amendment issue is important and

23

perhaps even harder than the other issue.

24
25

MR. HAFEN:

To -- to some extent, Your Honor.

But again, our position is that it is not testimonial and

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's not incriminating.

2

QUESTION:

It's simply -­

But it -- but it is the -- the odd

3

thing about this case is that the inquiry is made and it's

4

significant only in the context of a criminal

5

investigation.

6

when you've got a Terry stop.

7

That's the only time the statute applies,

MR. HAFEN:

That -- that's correct.

And in

8

regard to the Fourth Amendment, again it gets back to this

9

balancing issue.

This Court is going to have to balance

10

the -- any apparent personal security interests of Mr.

11

Hiibel against the important legitimate interests that the

12

government has in this case.

detection of crime.

Well, I understand all the arguments

QUESTION:

does say, shall identify yourself.
QUESTION:

Well, ignorance of the law is

generally no excuse, is it?

17

MR. HAFEN:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Well, I agree that the Fifth

19

Amendment is -- is the hard -- harder question in this

20

case, especially given the convoluted opinions in Byers.

21

It does seem to me that because the statute really focuses

22

on what we might call Terry stops, that you have a class

23

of persons who are within the zone of the commission of a

24

crime, and so the Fifth Amendment becomes -- it becomes

25

slightly more of a suspect class.

I don't know how that

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

could take care of the witness hypothetical.

2

person was certainly under suspicion of -- of criminal

3

activity.

4

MR. HAFEN:

But this

Well, to some extent, but going back

5

to the videotape that -- that the Court has, after Deputy

6

Dove asked the -- or informed Mr. Hiibel, I'm here because

7

of a fight between the two of you, he indicates, I know

8

nothing about that.

9

somewhat out of the class of a suspect now to a potential

So that may very well take him

10

witness.

11

response, doesn't know now, well, is this the man that was

12

reported hitting the woman in the truck or did that person

13

leave and this is simply another passenger in the truck.

14

So viewed objectively, he has every right or -- to -- to

15

ask the question and because it wouldn't constitute a

16

Fifth Amendment violation in that context if Mr. Hiibel

17

truly was a witness, then he would be obligated to answer

18

the question.

19

At that time, Deputy Dove, based on that

QUESTION:

What -- what's the closest case you

20

have for us?

21

What's the closest case you have for us to show that this

22

is not a Fifth Amendment violation?

23

The Nevada court doesn't address this issue.

MR. HAFEN:

It would be Byers, and we rely upon

24

Byers.

And again, granted, it's a plurality decision but

25

with a strong concurrence by Justice Harlan.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION:

I -- I thought your -- you were

2

saying earlier that your strongest reason would be that he

3

had already, in effect, taken himself out of Fifth

4

Amendment protection by saying I know nothing about that.

5

MR. HAFEN:

In -- in that context, yes, because

6

now he, according to Deputy Dove, viewed objectively, is

7

potentially a -- a witness.

8
9

QUESTION:

Yes, but then your rationale for the

arrest should be that you're a potential witness, and for

10

that reason, we have a right to -- we have a right to

11

apprehend the witness to make him testify to the crime.

12

You don't need the -- the Terry stop rationale for that.

13

If you think he's a witness to a crime, the Terry stop is

14

really irrelevant.

15

MR. HAFEN:

Well, but the reasonable suspicion

16

was formed prior to meeting with -- with Mr. Hiibel.

17

he had every -- at least he had the reasonable suspicion

18

for initially detaining.

19

QUESTION:

So

From the standpoint of the Fifth

20

Amendment, what rule do you want us to adopt?

21

the police require persons to give their identity in your

22

view under the Fifth Amendment constitutionally?

23

MR. HAFEN:

When can

During -- first of all, you have to

24

make sure that there's reasonable suspicion to detain the

25

person and at that point then when the officer asks the

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

person for identification or what his name is, then if the

2

person doesn't respond, then the person can be arrested.

3

QUESTION:

What about our witness hypothetical

4

where -- the Chief Justice's hypothetical of -- of the

5

murder with five people standing there and my hypothetical

6

-- you don't -- you don't think the police can demand

7

identification at that point from witnesses?

8
9

MR. HAFEN:

Oh, they -- they certainly could

demand at that point.

10

QUESTION:

11

they fail to give the answer?

12

MR. HAFEN:

What -- could they be criminalized if

Well, it depends if at that time

13

there's reasonable suspicion to believe that one of those

14

individuals may have committed a crime.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Oh, so then you're abandoning the

witness rationale.
QUESTION:

Well, but the statute doesn't apply

18

to pure witness.

19

does not apply to the -- to the witness of the bank

20

robbery who's not suspected of doing the robbery.

21
22

That's the point.

MR. HAFEN:

could ask innocent people to give their name and not -­
and not a person under criminal suspicion.

11

MR. HAFEN:

12

QUESTION:

Well, again, let -- let me back up.
Do you think that maybe when he's

13

invoking the Fifth Amendment, he has to invoke the Fifth

14

Amendment?

15

MR. HAFEN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
Do you think maybe -- if he just

17

can't say I won't answer -- he can be arrested if he just

18

says I won't answer, but if he says I won't answer on the

ground that it might tend to incriminate me, then the

policeman would probably have probable cause.

point to find out whether he should just let him go away

That's not part of the inquiry.
There has to be a reasonable

name and thereby determine their criminal history does is

to afford the officer with information that may lead him

Which comes first in your view in the

suspicion under Terry?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it would -- first of all,

it would depend on whether there's a reasonable basis for

believing that the person is armed and dangerous because

he can ask for the -- for the name for reasons of safety

12

-- and that's why it should be allowed without anything

more -- why doesn't exactly that same reason support an

authority to -- to patdown even in the absence of any

15

reason to believe that the person may be armed and

16

dangerous?

17

It would contribute to officer safety.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, it would, but the -- the

18

reason why the Fourth Amendment requires a showing a

19

reasonable basis to believe that they're armed and

20

dangerous before conducting a patdown is because, as the

21

Court described the patdown in Terry, it represents a

22

severe intrusion on the person's personal security.

23

that's not the case for the question, what is your name.

24

That doesn't represent any sort of physical intrusion on

25

the person whatsoever.

QUESTION:

The insignificance of the intrusion.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Now, I thought -- I thought under

14

Terry we've held that a police officer may detain someone

15

briefly without probable cause on a reasonable suspicion

16

the person has committed or is about to commit a crime and

17

during that process may ask all kinds of questions of the

18

person, although, as far as I can find out, this Court has

19

said the person does not have to respond to the questions.

20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

What you're pointing to,

21

Justice O'Connor, I believe is the dictum that was

22

discussed early in Berkemer v. -- in Berkemer v. McCarty.

23

And that, first of all, is dictum, but not only is it

24

dictum, it's ambiguous dictum because the language that

25

the Court used was that the officer is entitled to ask a

1

moderate number of questions, first, to determine the

2

person's identity and, second, to obtain information with

3

which to confirm or dispel the officer's suspicions.

4

then the Court goes on to say that, of course, the

5

detainee is not required to respond.

6

that statement concerning that the detainee is not

7

required to respond relates to the initial basis for

8

asking questions which is determinative of his identity.

It's unclear whether

And the right to do a patdown is

something you do after the officer has made the initial

decision to detain and ask some questions presumably.

officer can ask, you know, and he doesn't get an answer,

What's wrong with that?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

would think, unless you have some evidence to the

contrary, that the officer who's in a Terry stop

Are there -- a lot of instances where they

10

look -- he said what's your name and then the person -­

11

and by the way, you have to answer or you're going to be

12

in more trouble so therefore the person gives him his real

13

name, which happens to turn out to be one of the worst

14

criminals in the country, and then he pats him down.

15

grant you that could happen.

I

16

But contrast that with a situation where you

17

take Berkemer literally, and now you say if he doesn't

answer, sure you can pat him down.

19

What's wrong -- I -- I don't see it.

I'm back

20

to my point which you heard me ask, and I -- I'd really

like an answer in terms of -- I mean, Berkemer cites Davis

that you can't -- you can ask what you want, but they

don't have to answer.

But why

sort of canceled that by thinking not answering would also

give the policeman a justification for the patdown.

for retreating from the rather strong dictum?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But I -- I

No, but Justice Breyer, I don't

think the patdown eliminates the danger.

And -- and you don't believe that the

the person has previously been convicted of a crime that

I would agree, Your Honor.

9

MR. DOLAN:

Well -- well, with respect to the

10

Terry stop itself, it is for investigation related to

11

whether or not a crime may occur or is about to occur.

12

And the officer has available to them tools to inquire.

13

They can temporarily detain the person to see if there are

14

witnesses around who could identify the person as having

15

engaged in criminal conduct and the like.

16

But the -- the notion that a person has to

17

affirmatively provide a ticket to terminate that Terry

encounter really tips the balance too much in favor of the

19

State and risks a lot of benefits to our society that

accrue through freely being able to move, to be let alone,
