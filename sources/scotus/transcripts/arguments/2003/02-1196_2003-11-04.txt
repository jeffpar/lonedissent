ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Over 10,000 persons in 38 States invested $300

12

million in respondent's payphone business on the

13

expectation that their investments would yield a 14

14

percent return due to respondent's experience, efficiency,

15

and management expertise.

16

transactions were not investment contracts merely because

17

they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than

18

an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can

19

not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of

20

the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC

21

interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's

22

jurisprudence.

23

The decision below that these

The congressional definition of security, as

24

this Court has repeatedly said, is broad and flexible, and

25

intended to be all-inclusive to cover the countless and

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

variable schemes devised by those who would seek money

2

from others on the promise of a return.

3

intended, in the words of this Court, to encompass

4

virtually any instrument that might be sold as an

5

investment, and the term investment contract, this Court

6

has held, was intended to be a broad catch-all.

7

Therefore, substance, not form or title, governs.

8
9

Congress

These terms, investment contract, are to be
construed broadly to embrace - again, in the words of this

10

Court - all forms of investment schemes that bear a

11

resemblance to what is commonly understood to be a

12

security.

13

so creative, these terms must be flexible and inclusive.

14

A catch-all must catch all.

15

that Congress would have defined security -

16

And this Court has said, because promoters are

It is irrational to conclude

QUESTION: Mr. Solicitor General, may I jump

17

ahead for a second?

Is the - is your adversary correct in

18

saying that as far as decided cases are concerned, not the

19

position of the SEC, but there is no judicial decision

20

holding that a - an instrument that provides a fixed

21

return is an investment contract?

22

MR. OLSON: Well, Justice Stevens, I can answer

23

this by saying that the seminal case, Howey, referred to

24

and cited Blue Sky cases and Federal court of appeals

25

decisions, which did contain those type of instruments,

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fixed return instruments.

This specific question has not

2

previously been decided by this Court, but the Court has

3

never decided, and the cases that the Court referred to in

4

Howey did not ever say that - that the fixed return

5

instrument was excluded from the term investment contract.

6

QUESTION: How about the United Housing case?

7

MR. OLSON: Well, again, with respect to that

8

case, the - I - the Court has decided consistently that

9

what is critical is the - that the investor expects a

10
11

return.

The Court has never said QUESTION: But the United Housing case did refer

12

- suggest that the requirement that the income come from

13

profits, did it not?

14

MR. OLSON: Well, the - the references to the -

15

to the - this - from this - our perspective, Mr. Chief

16

Justice, is that the return must be examined from the

17

standpoint of the investor, the invest - and the Court - I

18

don't think the Court intended to restrict in that case,

19

and the language is not reasonably susceptible in my

20

judgement to the - to the understanding that that was

21

intended to exclude investments or instruments that

22

provided a fixed return.

23

What the Court has repeatedly referred to is the

24

- from the standpoint of the investor, what the investor

25

is expecting to do is to put his or her money to work for

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

him or her, that is to say, put that money into an

2

enterprise of some sort so the investor can sit back and

3

watch the returns come in.

4

whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.

5

fact, the definition in both the 33 and the 34 Act

6

includes types of investments, such as common stock, that

7

have speculative returns built into their definition, so

8

to speak, fixed returns instruments, such as bonds,

9

preferred stock, indentures, and that sort of thing.

10

The investor doesn't care
In

Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly

11

said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood.

12

But because Congress wanted to embrace, because this is a

13

remedial statute intended to protect the investing public

14

and the integrity of the marketplace so that people will

15

feel secure in investing their resources in other

16

instruments that promoters are offering -

17

QUESTION: General Olson, you - you put the

18

stress on investment and that seems right with the statute

19

refers to investment contracts, but there are surely debt

20

instruments that would not be investment contracts.

21

what is the dividing line between something that

22

constitutes a plain old debt that is not an investment

23

contract and not a security, and one that is?

24

do we identify something as an investment contract rather

25

- rather than an ordinary debt?

So

I mean, how

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. OLSON: Well, I think the answer, Justice

2

Ginsburg, is that many of those instruments that are

3

ordinary debt instruments may be investment contracts as

4

well.

5

are overlapping -

6
7

QUESTION: And what makes it - what makes
something an investment contract?

8
9

This Court has repeatedly said is that these terms

MR. OLSON: Well, what this Court has said is
that when a person puts their money into a common

10

enterprise with the expectation - expectation of a return,

11

that is - through the - as a result of the efforts of

12

others, that is an investment contract.

13

or many types of offerings, might be based upon a fixed

14

return and might appear in the - to look like notes or

15

fixed return types of investments and still be investment

16

contracts.

17

Now, many notes,

QUESTION: But the - depending on the investment

18

skills of others, that's - is very unhelpful to me.

19

would think most creditors who extend credit rely on the

20

investment skill or the financial responsibility of - of

21

the lender.

22

back.

23

limitation.

24
25

I - I

That's how they're going to get their money

So, I - I find that test hard to work with as a
I know it comes from Howey.

MR. OLSON: It does - it does come from Howey,
and I think that the best way to look at that, Justice

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Kennedy, is to look at that the investor, as opposed to

2

using his own resources, his own efforts, his own energy,

3

his own creativity, is counting on other people to make

4

the - the instrument -

5
6

QUESTION: Well, but my point is all creditors do
that just on straight loans -

7

MR. OLSON: Well - well -

8

QUESTION: - so that doesn't advance us very far.

9

MR. OLSON: Well, that's right.

That's correct.

10

And there are some overlap, but this Court has said, and

11

it repeated it and analyzed it from that context in the

12

Reves case, that there are some commercial contexts and

13

some consumer contexts in which the Securities Acts were

14

never intended to cover.

15

QUESTION: Well, the Reves case had language that

16

doesn't help you because it seems to exclude a fixed

17

return, but -

18

MR. OLSON: Well -

19

QUESTION: - so I - I don't -

20

MR. OLSON: We -

21

QUESTION: - know how great the Reves case is for

22
23

you.
MR. OLSON: What the Reves case says, and I think

24

Your Honor is referring to footnote 4 in the case, in

25

which the Court, in construing what was meant by the - the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

term note, looked at the definition of - in - in the

2

Forman case, which included the earlier Howey case, as to

3

define an investment contract.

4

Court very carefully went on to say the definition that

5

we're examining here with respect to investment contract

6

is irrelevant with respect to notes.

7

upon dicta in a sense, because the Court - we - I - we

8

respectfully submit - mischaracterized Forman, the case

9

that the - where the Court was concentrating on the

But in that footnote, the

That is dicta piled

10

difference between someone investing their resources to

11

get something to use, in that case -

12

QUESTION: Well, if - if you - if you don't like

13

dicta that's against you, a lot of the things you've been

14

quoting are dicta that weren't really necessary to

15

deciding the case.

16

MR. OLSON: Well, what we - Mr. Chief Justice, I

17

don't think that what we're quoting with respect to what

18

we're relying on is dicta.

19

defined the term investment contract, first of all, in the

20

Joiner case, and then in the Howey case in very broad

21

terms.

22

What the - the Court is - has

QUESTION: Supposing I - I loaned someone

23

$10,000, they've just hung out their shingle to practice

24

law, and I'm - I want obviously the money back, but

25

whether I get the money back or not is very much going to

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

depend on his skill.

2

Is that an investment contract?

MR. OLSON: That's - that is - that is probably

3

not an investment contract because it is a personal

4

transaction between individuals.

5

factors that this Court used in the Reves -

6
7

QUESTION: Well, but all these are transactions
between individuals.

8
9

What this - could the

That doesn't distinguish anything.

MR. OLSON: Well, what the - one of the - one of
the things that the Court said in Reves is that, to the

10

extent that there are any ambiguities at the edge and

11

those particular factors were considered in Reves, it -

12

the - the scheme of distribution, the nature of the

13

relationships between the individuals, is this - the - is

14

someone seeking to acquire money to use as capital in the

15

- in the operation of an enterprise -

16

QUESTION: Well, is - are you saying then that a

17

one-on-one transaction can never be an investment

18

contract?

19

MR. OLSON: No, we're not saying that.

In fact,

20

the Court held to the contrary in the Wharf Holdings case

21

that there may be - and in another case in this Court's

22

jurisprudence - that simply because there are one

23

individual or one entity dealing with another entity

24

doesn't exclude the - the operation of the term investment

25

contract.

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: But the problem is, as - as you well

2

know, Justice Ginsburg begins it, and the Chief Justice is

3

asking the same question, if we're going to write this

4

opinion, it seems to me we have to have some limiting

5

principles, some limiting language.

6

talk about these facts and it'd be a case good for this

7

ride only, but we're - we're wondering about whether or

8

not these facts yield certain insights as to what might be

9

definitional principles for an investment contract.

10

Now, we could just

MR. OLSON: Well, with respect to the cases at

11

the margin, the Court articulated the same kind of

12

analysis that the Securities and Exchange Commission does.

13

Where there are cases at the margin, the Court will

14

consider the motivation of the person raising the money,

15

the person investing in the - in the operation, the nature

16

and type of promotion that's taking place, and - and the

17

motivations of the seller and things of that nature.

18

- what the question presented here is considerably more

19

narrow, the question presented here is it - is - is it

20

disqualified as an investment contract simply because the

21

return is fixed or specified?

22

What

Now, if the Court were to adopt that definition,

23

imagine the size of the super highway loophole that would

24

be created in the Securities Act.

25

the sky or - or a speculative return, the investors that

Instead of promising

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

develop these types of schemes will simply say 50 percent

2

or 25 percent -

3

QUESTION: Yes, but - but - but you don't - well,

4

maybe you do - we just say an investment contract can

5

include a fixed return and then remand it to the Eleventh

6

Circuit for it to figure out the puzzle?

7

MR. OLSON: Well, it's not - the - the only

8

reason that the Eleventh Circuit decided that this case

9

couldn't go forward - they couched it in terms of

10

jurisdiction, but it's really failure to state a claim -

11

was that this instrument had a fixed 14 percent return and

12

said investment contracts can't not include that -

13

QUESTION: So your point is that's all we have to

14

decide, whether the fact that it's a fixed return excludes

15

it from the definition of a security?

16

MR. OLSON: Precisely.

17

QUESTION: But it would be desirable to have some

18

clearer understanding of what's covered, and if you had to

19

take your best shot at constructing a definition, what

20

would it be?

21

MR. OLSON: Well, I would adopt, and the

22

Government would propose, that the Court do no more than

23

rearticulate what the Court has repeatedly stated - and

24

it's stated it as well in Howey as it could possibly state

25

it - a transaction in which a person invests money in an

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enterprise with the expectation of a return, gain, profit.

2

Now, in the Forman case that we submit was not

3

characterized correctly in the Reves footnote, the Court

4

used all of those terms, the expectation of a profit, the

5

expectation of a return.

6

In Howey itself the Court -

QUESTION: We - we've gone - gone around that.

I

7

mean, the problem is the ordinary loan, the ordinary loan

8

from one individual to another.

9

you will pay it back over so many years and give me so

I loan you $10,000 and

10

much interest a year, meets that qualification, meets that

11

description, and you acknowledge that that is not an

12

investment contract.

13

MR. OLSON: The - what the Court has said is that

14

in - in those kind of cases, where it does not look as

15

typical as the typical investment scheme -

16
17

QUESTION: What makes it look like a typical
investment - I mean, that's what we're trying to get -

18

MR. OLSON: What makes it look like a -

19

QUESTION: What makes it look like the typical

20

investment -

21

MR. OLSON: Well, the characteristics are -

22

QUESTION: You say it is not the mere fact that

23

it's not a fixed return.

That isn't it.

What is it then?

24

MR. OLSON: Well, the things that make it look

25

like an investment contract in this context is that the

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

individual is putting himself, his money, into an

2

enterprise that is being, in this case, widely promoted -

3

as I said, 10 - over 10,000 investors put their money

4

into this enterprise hoping to get some return as a result

5

of the - the efficiency or effectiveness -

6

QUESTION: So at least where it's marketed to the

7

public you would say it's covered, at least that, even

8

though you don't know backing up where to cut it off?

9

MR. OLSON: Well, the - the precise lines here,

10

Justice O'Connor, may be difficult in a particular one-

11

on-one investment case.

12

the Reves case, said that there - there are - there are

13

situations that look more like consumer transactions or

14

they may look - more look like -

15

The Court acknowledged that in

QUESTION: So isn't the question about the

16

individual transaction really related to the conflict on

17

this horizontal and vertical distinction that Judge Lay

18

relied on in his concurring opinion?

19

it, that's not before us as to the validity of his vote in

20

the case.

And as I understand

21

MR. OLSON: That's - that's correct, Justice -

22

QUESTION: Because I don't understand either

23

party to have addressed the - this alleged conflict over

24

horizontal or vertical.

25

MR. OLSON: That was not what - yes, that's

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

correct.

2

opinion, but the court did not rely upon that, the parties

3

have not briefed that, and that question is not before

4

this Court.

5

Judge Lay discussed that in his concurring

QUESTION: So it's entirely possible that you

6

could win here and the case would be remanded for the

7

court of appeals to decide whether or not Judge Lay was

8

right?

9
10
11
12

MR. OLSON: I guess that's - I guess that's that's possible.

I -

QUESTION: Your - your opening argument says
there are agreements for investment contracts -

13

MR. OLSON: Yes, we did.

14

QUESTION: - that's what you asked us -

15

MR. OLSON: Yes, we do.

And - and - I think that

16

there is - this is not a difficult case from that

17

standpoint, because all of the indicia that the SEC has

18

been using for years, and what the SEC has articulated

19

this standard in formal adjudications, to which this Court

20

defers under Chevron, it did 2 years ago in the Zandford

21

case, with respect to the SEC, there is here in this case

22

70 years of consistent enforcement of this principle by

23

the Securities and Exchange Commission -

24
25

QUESTION: So to be clear about your - what
you're saying is, there are a lot of criteria that rule

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

out loans, ordinary loans, because after all, they would

2

otherwise come in the words evidence of indebtedness.

3

There are a lot of words in this contract that could pick

4

up ordinary loans, but then there are a lot of criteria

5

that rule them out, of all those words, not just

6

investment contract.

7

What you would like is a decision that says, the word

8

profit in Howey meant profit in the sense of ordinary

9

return, return being broad enough to encompass fixed or

And this case is about one word.

10

variable returns of various kinds, period, end of the

11

matter, reversed or remanded.

12

that's your point, not get into these other criteria for

13

other things.

14

That's - that's your -

MR. OLSON: Precisely, and the Court has not done

15

that in the past, does not need to do so here.

16

situations like the Reves case where the Court said, well,

17

some notes are securities, some notes are not securities,

18

and then goes through - what the Court in that case was

19

looking at, a Second Circuit decision that said, well,

20

some notes are not securities, some are securities, and

21

then laid out a methodology, which, by the way, is the

22

same methodology that the SEC understand - well - widely

23

understood to employ with respect to those cases at the

24

margin.

25

There are

But, Justice Breyer, I agree completely.

This

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is a paradigmatic investment contract.

It's like the

2

cases involving chinchillas or rabbits, one of these cases

3

involving rabbits, it - there's two of the - two of the -

4
5
6

QUESTION: Except it's different in that here
there's a fixed return.

7

In those, there was not.

MR. OLSON: That's not correct, respectfully, Mr.

8

Chief Justice.

9

Howey, People v. White and Stevens v. Liberty Packing,

10

were -

11
12

Two of the - two of the cases cited in

QUESTION: Well, I thought you meant cases in
this Court.

13

MR. OLSON: No.

I'm talking about cases that

14

this Court accepted when it decided the Howey case, but

15

this Court has never -

16

QUESTION: Well, that's a pretty, you know,

17

that's a pretty tentative attribution to - to this Court,

18

that - that it was paying that close attention that it

19

understood in all of those cases whether it was a fixed

20

return or not.

21

MR. OLSON: Well, it certainly wasn't ruling it

22

out, Justice Scalia.

What this Court - what the - this

23

Court specifically said in Howey, because it had nothing

24

to go on.

25

definition as wide as possible to use again this Court's

Congress, first of all, decided to make the

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

language to cover everything that might commonly be

2

understood to be a security, and because promoters are so

3

ingenious, to cover all types of investments that might

carry some of those characteristics.

5

So the Court said, we're going to look at the

6

cases that involve the Blue Sky statutes that - that had

7

been in existence and had been interpreted prior to the

8

adoption of the 33 Act.

9

that limited investment contract to a variable return and

There's not one of those statutes

10

excluded fixed return, was not one of those cases under

11

the Blue Sky statutes that excluded fixed return

12

investment contracts from the definition of investment

13

contract.

14

QUESTION: Well, were - were they all fixed

15

return cases then?

16

excluded fixed returns.

17

You say there was not one of them that

MR. OLSON: They were not - they were not - some

18

of them were variable returns, Mr. Chief Justice, but some

19

of them were fixed return.

20

was People v. White, where, if the Court looks at that

21

case, the Court will find that the - the - the language of

22

it is - the party of the first part will pay $5,000 and

23

the party of the second part after 5 years will pay $7,500

24

back.

25

did the Court in Howey cite those two Blue Sky cases that

The two cases I cited, the one

That was a fixed return investment.

involved fixed returns, but the Court cited then four -

2

and we mention these, I'll not go through the names again

3

here, we mention them in our briefs - four court of

4

appeals decisions that had involved no pooling of interest

5

and there - there have been two SEC formal adjudications,

6

which again, as I said, this Court gives deference to.

7

And the first time the SEC sought to enforce an

8

investment contract in this kind of context is SEC v.

9

Universal Services, which goes back to 1936.

Very seldom

10

does this Court have that kind of 70-year history of

11

consistent enforcement by the agency vested with

12

responsibility, and again, these have matured themselves

13

into not only court decisions but, in addition, formal

adjudications.

20

particularly pages 116 through 119 of the joint appendix,

21

and this is the type of note that the - the respondent

22

will say, well, this was not our document, this was one of

23

our distributor's documents, but it's alleged in the - in

is - this was out there available for investors to see.

There are millions to be made from pay - owning payphones,

watch the profits add up.

3

document goes on to say, for the payphone owner, the need

4

to do individual things to make money is taken care of

5

through these management contracts, because the payphone

6

owner can benefit from the experience, operating

7

efficiencies, and management expertise provided by ETS

8

Payphones.

9
10
11

And then on page 119, this

QUESTION: What sort of management expertise is
required to manage payphones?
MR. OLSON: Well, there's - there are many of

12

things, at least, A, there was a promise that it was done,

13

and secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, where that payphone is

14

put, how it is managed, the appearance of the payphone, is

15

it - is it mechanically functioning properly.

have thousands and thousands of these payphones -

This was

though, running around replacing payphones.

20

MR. OLSON: Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, and maybe that's the point, that - that the

22

thousands of investors who invested in this type of scheme

23

are the same type of thousands of investors that invest in

24

other types of schemes.

require is that for people who are marketing opportunities

to invest widely to the public - and I use the word widely

2

carefully because it doesn't have to be that widely, but

3

it was here - to expect people to provide their money and

4

then to provide a return to put their money to work,

5

that's what the securities laws are all about, to provide

6

that remedial prophylactic purpose of requiring

7

registration so honest transactions will take place in the

marketplace.

If the investor could do to - to - to comply

10

with the Eleventh Circuit and say, well, I'm not going to

double your money every 5 years, or it's going to be a

13

good return, it's going to - it's going to be pie in the

sky, you're going to go home and retire, that would all of

15

a sudden make it not an investment contract.

And the very

QUESTION: But you're - you're saying that it -

18

it somehow remains - does it remain or not remain an

19

was not offered to the public, it's one individual who

MR. OLSON: Mr. - Justice Scalia, if it's the

2

same kind of transaction where I - I'm going to buy this

3

payphone, lease it back to me, I'm going to have a

4

management contract, and you're going to make a lot of

5

money, the fact that it's one person, this Court's

6

jurisprudence says does not make it not that - does not

make it not an investment contract.

from a straight loan?

What makes it different?

MR. OLSON: It is a - it is a package in which it

Breyer's question suggests it might - that might be a note

and that might be a security under certain circumstances.

But is it a - it is the type of scheme transaction in

19

which people invest their money on - for those types of

20

purposes, and - and in - where - where there are

21

difficulties at the margin, this Court and the SEC have

22

provided a formula by which these various different

23

factors can be examined as in the Reves case.

What I was about to say is that to the extent
that you change the requirement and allow it to be

That seems like tilting the securities laws completely on

their head.

most risk-averse are looking for guarantees of returns and

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. WOLENSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We start with the language of the statute, and

19

that tells us two things.

First of all, commercial leases

20

is not a term included in the statute, and second of all,

21

the term investment contract is undefined.

The Court's restrictive

QUESTION: Is it your position that no debt
security could ever be an investment contract?
MR. WOLENSKY: As long as it was a fixed return,
that is correct.
QUESTION: Well, why it distinguished between a
fixed return and an other kind of debt security?
MR. WOLENSKY: Well, under the SEC's explanation

14

in its briefs, it refers to a lot of things as fixed

15

returns, which are really just sham, boastful promises by

16

promoters, and I believe that's what takes this situation

17

completely out of what the SEC is proposing.

here agree that the correct test the Court should apply is

19

the Howey test.

20
21
22

Both parties

There - we don't disagree on that.

QUESTION: And you contend that test would never
cover a debt security?

That's my question.

MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct.

That test would

23

never cover a debt securities because this Court has

24

defined profits for Howey test purposes to mean an

25

expectation of profits from earning -

for excluding debt securities and limiting the coverage of

the Act to equity securities?

MR. WOLENSKY: Investment risk, Your Honor.
is the key.

9

That

QUESTION: Well, there was an investment risk
here.
MR. WOLENSKY: Well, there really wasn't, because
what you have is a commercial lease arrangement, a

10

telephone acts as the collateral, so to speak, to use this

11

Court's words from the Reves case, but you have a

12

commercial lease arrangement like commercial lease

13

arrangements done throughout the country -

14

QUESTION: Well, but this is a leasing

15

arrangement that's really a financing arrangement.

The

16

use of leasing for financing purposes really developed

17

after the Act was passed -

18

MR. WOLENSKY: It did -

19

QUESTION: - and this is really a financing

20
21
22
23

transaction.
MR. WOLENSKY: It can be characterized that way,
Your Honor.

That's correct.

QUESTION: Well, certainly the person's return,

24

it didn't depend on what happened in his own phone booth,

25

the one he happened to own.

His - his risk was what the

overall enterprise would produce, as I understand it.

2
3

MR. WOLENSKY: That's absolutely correct, Your
Honor, and that is a credit risk, not an investment risk.

4

QUESTION: What's preferred stock?

5

MR. WOLENSKY: Preferred stock is an - has both

6

investment risk, because it can have fluctuating values,

7

some do.

8

QUESTION: So can debt.

9

MR. WOLENSKY: Debt can if there's a market for

10

the debt.

That's correct.

11

QUESTION: There is.

12

MR. WOLENSKY: But the investor - that's correct

13

- but the characterization of the return to the investor

14

in debt is generally viewed as - as a return, the interest

15

rate, and as far as the market - market -

16

QUESTION: That is preferred stock.

17

MR. WOLENSKY: Preferred stock, but it's a

18

capital appreciation issue and that's not an issue here.

19

QUESTION: So can debt appreciate.

20

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, that's right, but that's

21

capital appreciation and we don't have capital

22

appreciation in this case.

QUESTION: What about bonds?

includes bonds.

QUESTION: Yeah, but the Reves case was dictum,

and the question here is, are we going to turn that dictum

Why

would Congress have wanted to exclude this kind of fixed

MR. WOLENSKY: There were leases that were being

4

So what do you mean by it?

5

risk, you know, we're all reacting this way because it

6

seems so obvious to us, anybody who invested money in this

has now lost all his money, so it must have been pretty

9

If you do, I want you to explain it.

10

You must not mean what we ordinarily

When you say no investment

So - so I - you must mean something special by it.

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, the - the money that was

11

lost was lost as a result of a bankruptcy and what

12

occurred in the bankruptcy, but when the bankruptcy was

13

filed, these phone owners still owned their telephones and

14

they were still entitled to their lease payments.

15

was dealt with in the bankruptcy and the details of that

16

are not involved in the record here but in - there's a - a

QUESTION: You think buying a - a whole portfolio

see in fluctuating values securities or equity securities.

12

QUESTION: Have you ever held a bond when
interest rates were going up?
MR. WOLENSKY: I - I agree QUESTION: You would have learned what an
investment risk was.
MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Souter, I agree that bonds

13

can fluctuate in value and that deals with a capital

14

appreciation -

15
16

QUESTION: Which means that it is more than a
mere credit risk.

17

MR. WOLENSKY: To the extent you were looking to

18

the bond to return a value and - and hold it for purposes

19

of changing value, it theoretically could.

20

QUESTION: And anyone who buys a bond with the

21

possible expectation of selling before maturity assumes

22

exactly that.

23

MR. WOLENSKY: They are going to face that risk

24

and that - that is, in fact, an investment risk.

But the

25

key here, it seems to me, is the fact that you do have a

a legitimate lease agreement.

with respect to the coverage of other regulatory agencies.

We have in fact Federal Trade Commission coverage here.

There's no question about that.

It is

It is like any other

There is also a significant issue here

It is involved -

QUESTION: Mr. Wolensky, you don't challenge, do
you, that under State Blue Sky Laws, this distinction

10

between variable and fixed return is not made, that State

11

Blue Sky Laws treat as investment contracts - do not draw

12

the line between fixed and variable returns?

13

MR. WOLENSKY: The - the challenge I make is that

14

before 1933 the State Blue Sky Laws that were - cases that

15

were incorporated and mentioned in Joiner and in Howey

16

were variable return cases.

17

the two cases.

I disagree with the SEC on

18

QUESTION: Do you agree that there are a body of

19

cases under State Blue Sky Laws that involve - maybe some

20

of them even involve these payphone schemes - but that

21

have fixed and not variable returns?

22

MR. WOLENSKY: As of today, that is correct.

23

That is what I see in the amici brief and I have no reason

24

to question that.

25

State law, it would include fixed returns, that's correct.

we are told that the one thing in this area, because

schemes are invented every day, is that - that the

interpretation should be flexible, not static, to meet the

countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek

the use of money of others?

MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has has repeated that over and over.

I will agree with that,

but the Court has talked about new, novel, and unusual

what a court says in a casual footnote, when the case had

18

nothing to do with fixed versus variable returns.

19

yes, the Court made it used in cautious languages, but we

20

- but in none of the cases that came here was the

21

question, do you draw the line between fixed and variable

22

returns?

23

it Forman or United Housing - there it was a question of

24

investment versus consumption.

25

sit back and get money from it or did you buy it so you

I mean,

In the case that - that you featured - you call

Did you buy this thing to

2

was before the Court in this case.

3

our cases that - that drew the line between - that where

4

the issue was before the Court.

5

That was the distinction that
I don't know any of

MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Ginsburg, in Forman, the

6

Court had to address the issue of whether there was an

7

investment contract involved, and it stated what I would

8

call the Forman formulation of profits in connection with

9

doing that analysis on the three types of profits that

10

allegedly - or that had been found and allegedly were

11

present in the Second Circuit decision, and it applied

12

that formulation to each one of those.

13

So it was -

QUESTION: But it did - but the case was not

14

about equity versus debt classification.

15

whether you were attracted - whether you were attracted to

16

purchasing the shares by a desire to get a financial

17

return or were you attracted because you wanted a place to

18

live.

19

the dividing line that the Court was dealing with there.

20

It wasn't dealing with equity versus debt.

21

It was about

That's what - that's the two questions - that was

MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

22

And then in Reves, it was dealing with the distinction

23

between equity and debt.

24
25

QUESTION: Well, but in - in Forman there was no
distinction between fixed and variable income.

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WOLENSKY: It was not, but when you read the

2

- Justice Kennedy, when you read what the Court said in

3

Forman, it's talking about an expectation of profits or

4

capital appreciation, and those are two variable forms.

5

They're not - they're not fixed.

6

with the marketplace.

7

They necessarily vary

If I can finish answering your question, Justice

8

Ginsburg, with respect to Reves, there was a distinction,

9

a very specific distinction there, between fixed and - and

10

variable.

That's what that case was about, investment

11

contract versus note.

12

that the investment contract case of - that the investment

13

contract test of Howey would apply to notes.

14

series of tests and this Court used the Reves opinion to -

And the Eighth Circuit had decided

There were a

15

to go through those and decide, and it came up with a

16

family resemblance test that had been used by the Second

17

Circuit.

18

what the Court is doing is distinguishing and explaining

19

why Howey does not apply to notes, which are fixed

20

instruments.

21

and it - it was unanimously stated that -

22

In the footnote in Reves, it is very clear that

I think it is not just a passing reference

QUESTION: But I thought that - I thought that

23

the meaning of investment contract was not at issue in

24

Reves.

25

MR. WOLENSKY: The meaning of investment contract

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was not at issue, but distinguishing investment contract

2

was at issue in Reves, and explaining why it was not

3

applicable in that case.

4

the SEC briefed the issue as amicus took the same position

5

it - it has taken here, and the Court in Reves said that

6

is not the position we accept.

7

The parties briefed the issue,

QUESTION: And it's - it's taken that position

8

for a long time, Mr. Wolensky.

It's not just the case law

9

that you have to contend with, it's also - this is after

10

all an administrative law case.

The meaning of investment

11

contract, you must admit, is at least ambiguous, and the

12

SEC has taken the position it's taken here for a very long

13

time.

14

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, if I can address -

15

QUESTION: Why shouldn't we defer to the F -

16
17
18
19
20

SEC's judgement about the matter?
MR. WOLENSKY: If I can address that for just a
moment, Justice Scalia QUESTION: That's why I asked the question.

I

hoped you would.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. WOLENSKY: Thank you, sir.

With respect to

23

the very long time, if you go back to the case the SEC has

24

pointed to a number of times, the Universal Service case

25

from 1939 in the Seventh Circuit, when you - and the SEC

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

talks about its position in that case - its position in

2

that case was stated in its brief in that case, and when

3

you look at its brief in that case, it recognizes that it

4

is not dealing with a fixed return as we would talk about

5

it.

6

ultimately credited to the contributor's account, the

7

amount itself being dependent upon the degree of success

8

attending the venture - and I'm reading from pages 39 and

9

40 and footnote 10 - with respect to the Abbett, Sommer

In fact, in the brief, the SEC says the amount

10

case, which is a 19 - I believe 62 decision - by the SEC,

11

the SEC admitted in Abbett, Sommer that it wasn't looking

12

at traditional profits analysis.

13

That was a mortgage loan servicing case and they

14

said that what was being offered there was not just the

15

repayment on the notes but also the services, and they

16

found that the reduction of risk in that case was the -

17

basically the profit.

18

normal profit analysis and that's freely admitted.

19

So they departed from what is a

In the interpretative release they've issued,

20

the multi-level release under the 33 Act, number 5211, in

21

there the SEC admits that Howey is an equity-type test.

22

They specifically say that.

23

at the history of what this Court has done and what the

24

SEC has done, when you get to - when you get to Reves and

25

when you get to Forman, it is - there's no ambiguity left

So I think that when you look

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as to what is meant by profits at that point.

2

a position -

3

QUESTION: I think there is.

So I think

I think that in

4

United Housing itself they spoke about profit may be

5

derived from income yielded by an investment, income

6

yielded by investment.

7

earnings.

8
9

That doesn't say income from

MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct, but in the very
same area of the opinion is where the Court says by

10

profits in the Howey analysis, we have meant a

11

participation in earnings or capital appreciation, citing

12

the earlier cases.

13

QUESTION: They said that in one place.

They

14

said financial returns in another place.

15

in another place.

16

precise use of those terms because they were focusing on

17

an investment purpose versus a - a utilitarian purpose.

18

They said income

Maybe they were so incautious about the

MR. WOLENSKY: I would agree with that, but the

19

fact that Reves concluded what it did about Forman's

20

requirements would tend to show that that's really what

21

Forman required.

22

was not free to disregard what was a unanimous statement

23

by this Court.

24

opinion or change its view, but there is no compelling

25

reason to depart from what has been accepted for 25 years.

The - the court of appeals, of course,

This Court obviously can change its

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Other courts of appeals -

2
3

QUESTION: Well, why isn't there, when the SEC let's assume that you're right about that the SEC was

4

never crystal clear about its position.

But now it says,

5

we've looked at these schemes, payphones is a good one, a

6

lot of elderly people are investing in these schemes

7

because they promise a fixed return and that sounds secure

8

to them, better than variable out of earnings and profits,

9

so this is exactly what we should be protecting the public

10

against.

11

you're dealing with a statutory term that's in a line,

12

some of the things are equity, some are debt, and in the

13

middle is this term investment contract.

14

tie it to variable versus fixed?

15

If the SEC takes that position clearly now and

Why should we

MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Ginsburg, because this

16

Court has said more than once, every fraud is not a

17

securities fraud.

18

There are several risk-reducing factors involved in these

19

leases.

20

the Uniform Commercial Code.

21

coverage, other agencies.

22

agencies that filed amici briefs here have indicated that

23

they believe they have coverage of those.

24
25

There are other avenues of protection.

The leases themselves are covered by State law in
There's other regulatory

In fact, some of the State

So the fact that the Federal securities laws
might not cover this doesn't mean that there's not going

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to be protection of the public.

The consequence, and I

2

think it's an important consequence that the Court has to

3

be aware of here if it agrees with the SEC's position, is

4

that every equipment lease can be brought under the rubric

5

of Howey if -

6

QUESTION: Why, why, why?

7

QUESTION: That's not -

8

QUESTION: I mean, there are all kinds of other

9

criteria, you know.

I mean, you have to be putting up

10

money, it has to be - if it is a big market - scheme

11

marketed to the - to the public like this, yes.

12

isn't, if GM happens to buy some - a railroad car from one

13

of its suppliers, I would think the answer's no.

14

there are a lot of other criteria, so why everyone?

15

But if it

But

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, the - it is not in the

16

record but it is public knowledge and information that is

17

available that some $200 billion of equipment leasing

18

occurs every year, and it - equipment leasing involves

19

everything from telephone systems to computers, office

20

equipment.

21

applies to this large industry -

22

It is a very, very large industry.

If that

QUESTION: You'd have to be passive, you'd have

23

to - you'd have to treat it as an investment.

I doubt

24

that most of that leasing is really that, but I mean, my

25

point is, aren't there dozens of other criteria that you

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to satisfy, not just this fixed variable one?

2

that's a serious question.

3

And

I'm interested.

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, on - Justice Breyer, there

4

are - there essentially are four criteria that the - that

5

the SEC would say you have to apply: an investment of

6

money - and this Court said in Daniel that investment of

7

money doesn't just mean money, it can mean services, it

8

can mean assets.

9

doesn't matter whether you bring your phone to the

10

agreement or money to the agreement, but if you put

11

equipment into a lease arrangement, you have an investment

12

-

That's why we say in analyzing this it

13

QUESTION: Invest money may itself refer to the

14

thousands of public people who simply want to give money

15

to an enterprise in contrast to General Motors that rents

16

a railroad car as part of its business.

17

MR. WOLENSKY: I can contrast that and agree with

18

you that in General Motors, renting a railroad car is part

19

of its business.

20

run afoul of the securities laws.

21
22
23
24
25

It is not going to be probably found to

QUESTION: So what is the example of the bad
thing that happens when we agree with the SG?
MR. WOLENSKY: General, broad, small item
equipment leases will be covered by the Howey test.
QUESTION: The people who are not themselves in

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

business, by people who are not themselves in business or

2

by people who are themselves in business?

3

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, whether they're in business

4

or not in business the securities laws would still cover

5

them and I don't believe there's an exemption that would

6

be available for the ordinary business.

7

QUESTION: Why - why isn't your argument equally

8

applicable to notes?

We've been through that in Reves.

9

mean, you could have argued in Reves, my God, are you

10

going to cover every note?

11

argument here with investment - investment contract,

12

aren't you?

13

You're making the same

MR. WOLENSKY: Well, not necessarily.

I think

14

the Court did set forth some very specific criteria in

15

Reves.

16

notes that have credit risk and not investment risk.

17

The family resemblance test exempts out commercial

QUESTION: Justice Breyer has just been applying

18

a family resemblance test to exclude General Motors'

19

boxcar.

20

under investment contract as it is under note?

21

I

Why isn't that sort of thing just as feasible

MR. WOLENSKY: It is, and if you - if you look at

22

the criteria the Court looked to, I think you will see

23

that several of the criteria that this Court has talked

24

about indicate that this would not be covered.

25

it is - it's not specifically related, but the Court noted

I believe

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

four criteria, and if you apply those criteria, I think

2

you find that they in fact -

3

QUESTION: You've come to this quite late, but I

4

mean, it seems to me that there are other words besides

5

working with the nature of the fixed or variable return

6

that will draw the kind of line that you think - and I

7

guess I would think - you should draw between an ordinary

8

business, sale and lease-back so they can carry on their

9

business, and some kind of general marketing to the

10

public.

And I'm actually quite interested in that.

11

You've written about it, though, and I'll get it out of

12

the briefs.

13

MR. WOLENSKY: We have and - and I was - have

14

been trying to address the question that was presented

15

although we felt a different question was involved.

16

Court for 60 years has set a jurisprudential standard for

17

investment contracts and while the courts work on the

18

habits of people, people work on the habits of courts.

19

There are lines that have -

20
21
22

This

QUESTION: In those 60 years we've never said
that a fixed return can never be an investment contract.
MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct.

You've never

23

explicitly said that, but by never explicitly saying that,

24

that doesn't mean that it necessarily is covered.

25

decision of the court of appeals followed this Court's

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

says note, stock, treasury stock, fractional undivided

10

interest in oil, gas, mineral rights, straddle, option.

11

It's - there - it would be difficult to draft the statute

12

that was intended to be more all-inclusive than the words

13

used in these two provisions of the 33 and 34 Act.

14

manifestly clear that Congress wanted to cover the

15

waterfront, as this Court has said, everything that looks

16

like a security, and wanted to cover the whole range from

17

pure equity, if there is such a thing, to pure debt, if

18

there is such a thing.

19

One, this is about

The statute, which is extraordinarily broad,

It is

It would be - and then they put catch-all

20

provisions.

If the - if the words didn't cover it, there

21

were catch-all provisions, investment contract is one.

22

would be irrational for Congress to say, well, we've got a

23

catch-all for those - from A to Z - that go from A to H

24

that look more - look like equities, but not S to Z that

25

look more like debt, and then we're don't - not sure about
