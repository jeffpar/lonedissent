ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
The Child Online Protection Act addresses a

12

problem that all three branches of our national Government

13

have repeatedly and consistently described as compelling,

14

the pervasive and essentially unavoidable commercial

15

Internet pornography that inflicts substantial physical and

16

psychological damage on our children.

17

COPA was carefully drafted by Congress after

18

hearings, debate, reports, and findings according to

19

explicit guidance from this Court as to how constitutionally

20

to address and resolve and deal with this -- this menace.

21

The compelling need is overwhelming and is growing.

22

Internet pornography is widely accessible, as easily

23

available to children as a use of a television remote.

24

Court has noted, as Congress has, that immense psychological

25

and immeasurable physiological harm is done.

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

The -­

This

1

QUESTION: Mr. Olson, part of the problem is that

2

the pornography laws that would apply to adult viewers don't

3

seem to be enforced very well, the obscenity laws.

4

are very few prosecutions, and yet there's all kinds of

5

stuff out there.

There

What's -- what's going on?

6

MR. OLSON: Well -­

7

QUESTION: I mean, if they were enforced, a lot of

8
9

the problem would be assisted.
MR. OLSON: Well, it -- in the first place, Justice

10

O'Connor, while there may have been some lapse in -­

11

diminution in obscenity prosecutions a number of years ago,

12

the information that I'm given, and it's not in the record,

13

is that 21 indictments have been brought in the last 2

14

years, 17 have involved Internet.

15

respect to the children is the material that is so widely

16

available on the Internet that doesn't reach the definition

17

of -- that is not as bad as obscenity.

18

of information.

19

But the problem with

It is a wide amount

The legislative history described 28,000

20

pornographic sites in a -- this is also outside the record,

21

but if an individual goes to their Internet and -- and uses

22

an Internet search engine and -- and types in the word, free

23

porn, I did this this weekend, the -- your -- your computer

24

will say that there are 6,230,000 sites available.

25

that's available now -­

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

Now

1
2
3

QUESTION: Well, how many sites are there available
altogether on the Internet?
MR. OLSON: Well, there are -- there are a great

4

deal more than that, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't know the

5

exact number, but I believe the record, with respect to the

6

Child Online, COPA, uses -- describes those numbers, but it

7

is increasing enormously every single day, but the -­

8
9

QUESTION: Yes, even -- even the 28,000 was at the
time this bill was enacted.

10

MR. OLSON: That's right.

11

QUESTION: So I'm -- so I assume -­

12

MR. OLSON: And so the -­

13

QUESTION: -- it's much greater now.

14

MR. OLSON: And every evidence that's available to

15

us, and I don't think this is disputed by respondents, is

16

that the number of Internet sites is growing up

17

exponentially.

18

QUESTION: Those figures include the obscenity

19

violations too, I assume?

20

about sites that are affected by the Child Protection Act?

21

MR. OLSON: Well, I'm talking about sites that -­

22

You're -- you're not just talking

that would be available to you -­

23

QUESTION: Other things too, right.

24

MR. OLSON: -- to you or me -­

25

QUESTION: Right.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. OLSON: -- or to a 12-year-old -­

2

QUESTION: Right.

3

MR. OLSON: -- by typing in the word -­

4

QUESTION: Exactly.

5

MR. OLSON: -- free porn -­

6

QUESTION: Exactly.

7

MR. OLSON: -- where there would be no screen -­

8

QUESTION: Yeah.

9

MR. OLSON: -- preventing the child from getting to

10

that information.

11

QUESTION: Yeah, and my first inquiry was -- was

12

such a vast array of sites.

13

It's just amazing.

14

There are so few prosecutions.

MR. OLSON: Well, as I said, the number of

15

prosecutions are increasing.

16

and United States Attorney manual asks United States

17

Attorneys to focus on obscenity where there's evidence of

18

organized crime -­

19
20

What -- what the -- what the,

QUESTION: Now, you said free porn, not free
obscenity.

21

MR. OLSON: That's correct.

22

QUESTION: Presumably they still can't advertise

23

free obscenity.

We -- we've drawn a line.

24

MR. OLSON: That's correct, and I -­

25

QUESTION: Then I don't really understand, but

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

there's a line there somewhere between obscenity and

2

pornography, right?

3
4

MR. OLSON: Well, there's a line there that this
Court -­

5

QUESTION: Pornography is okay?

6

MR. OLSON: Well, this -- what we're talking about

7

today is something that would be described as -- and I'm

8

using the term pornography as a shorthand version to

9

describe what was described in the statute as harmful to

10

children.

11

and material which is harmful to children.

12

to describe the category of material that is harmful to

13

children using the language that was approved by this Court

14

in the Miller case, as modified by the Ginsberg v. New York

15

case with respect to material which is harmful to children,

16

which is broader than the definition of obscenity.

17

That's a -- statute itself refers to obscenity
It then goes on

The -­

QUESTION: You're -- you're not suggesting that the

18

free porn site that you call up would not include any

19

obscene material?

20

MR. OLSON: I did -- I didn't have time to go all

21

the way through all those sites.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. OLSON: And -- and -- and it's not a pleasant

24
25

-QUESTION: I'd imagine you found some that it was

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

obscene.

2

MR. OLSON: And it's -- I didn't.

I -- the

3

material that I saw and I think that the Court would see is

4

that the people that are putting in -- these are -- this is

5

material in front of, and the legislative history describes

6

this, the material which is obscene is usually kept behind

7

so-called blinders, which do -- which is a very good point

8

here, because the very mechanism that the statute requires

9

is already in existence with respect to commercial

10

pornography sites.

11

Justice Stevens, what the -- what the -- what the

12

purveyors of this material do is put in front of the screen

13

provocative material that we submit would meet the

14

definition of harmful to children and make that available to

15

everybody to entice people to go the next step to use their

16

credit card or their age identification mechanism to go the

17

next step.

18

QUESTION: General Olson, you said something that I

19

-- I would question.

20

blinder racks, but it isn't, because I don't have to give my

21

ID and I don't have to be concerned that someone will know

22

that this person with this address and this credit card

23

wants to look at this material.

24

-- the -- the idea of the blinder rack is to protect the

25

child, but at the same time, the one who wants to see it

You -- you said it's just like the

You can -- you can -- the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

doesn't have to disclose his identity.
MR. OLSON: Well, you're disclosing your identity,

3

Justice Ginsburg, because you're standing there in public

4

examining those -­

5

QUESTION: How many people are going to be in that

6

adult store, bookstore with you, as opposed to giving your

7

credit card number?

8

MR. OLSON: What you're -- what you're -- what

9

you're disclosing your identity in person, I -- we would,

10

the Government would argue that that is more invasive, but

11

that nonetheless that there's some -- this is a counterpart

12

to those blinder racks.

13

or adult bookstores or stores that you may go into where

14

those blinder racks are, there are cameras recording the -­

15

the -- for protection of the shops, for other reasons,

16

recording the presence of the person.

17

privacy of one's home, use -- utilizing this information

18

with the provision in the statute -­

19
20
21

In many of the convenience stores

We submit that in the

QUESTION: But the whole world can know about it if
I've given my credit card number.
MR. OLSON: It -- it is a -- it is a crime under

22

COPA for the persons providing that information pursuant to

23

adult identification provisions, it's section, subsection d

24

of COPA that makes it a crime to reveal that information.

25

So there is protection built into the statute that protects

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

the person's anonymity with respect to using that material,

2

which is not protected.

3

When a -­

QUESTION: Then why is there such resistance to

4

giving the ID and the credit card?

5

their credit cards, and I think the two reports said that

6

that was the case, the reports on COPA.

7

People resist giving it,

MR. OLSON: Well, some -- some people may.

8

Congress made a -- some people -- there -- the numbers are

9

not quantified at all, but there is privacy protection.

10

Giving your identity is necessary going into a nightclub,

11

going into an adult movie, or going into a bookstore and

12

using this material.

13

that's a price I don't want to pay, but it's not quantified

14

in -­

15
16
17

Some people may say, I don't want to,

QUESTION: You don't have to give your credit card
to go into the nightclub or the movie.
MR. OLSON: Well, you probably -- in some cases you

18

don't, in some cases maybe you do.

19

a charge -­

20

I don't know if there's

QUESTION: There -- there may be resistance made

21

there not on the part of people to stand in front of blinder

22

racks or to go into those portions of bookstores that are

23

excluded, that exclude children because of the presence of

24

pornography.

25

section because they don't want to be seen there or don't

There may be people who won't go into that

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

want to be seen standing in front of the blinder rack,

2

although they'd be happy to look at pornography if it was

3

mingled in with everything else.

4

MR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia, and

5

Congress acknowledged that.

6

Government -­

There's no dispute by the

7

QUESTION: Did -- I thought that at least we have

8

some cases that -- that recognize that there is -- someone

9

doesn't have to come forward and say, I want this material.

10

That was the Lamont case where the person wanted to get

11

whatever was being sent and didn't want to say, oh yes, I

12

want to get that material.

13

have the similar thing that a customer doesn't have to say,

14

I don't take that stuff off my screen -­

15

And Denver -- didn't Denver Area

MR. OLSON: In the Denver Area case, the person had

16

to make an application to unblock the material, that that

17

material -- there's a big distinction in the Denver Area

18

case because there wasn't a requirement of anonymity and a

19

protection of privacy in the statute.

20

bottom line, Justice Ginsburg, is that, yes, we have to

21

acknowledge that there is some burden that is imposed when

22

you're required to identify yourself into the purveyor of

23

this material, but that -- but you get to, you have the

24

opportunity to do that in the privacy of your own home.

25

But I guess the

By statute, a criminal statute protects the

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

privacy of your doing that, and the -- and the balance that

2

Congress struck, which is what this Court dealt with when it

3

dealt with this statute two -- on two previous occasions,

4

the Court did acknowledge that there's a compelling

5

governmental interest here, and that significant harm is

6

being done on a daily basis.

7

The magnitude -- we point this out on page 20 of

8

our brief -- that 11 million children visit these porn sites

9

every week, and that between the ages of 15 and 17, 70

10

percent of the children, according to the statistics that we

11

cite, visited porn site inadvertently.

12

to avoid.

13

It is very difficult

As we describe in our brief, the use of innocuous

14

names, I'd mentioned last time that I was here and it hasn't

15

changed, Whitehouse.com is a porn site.

16

things that the evidence suggest children visit and visit

17

accidentally or they're shown to by their friends, and then

18

it's very difficult to get off -­

19

Many of these

QUESTION: Mr. Olson, the -- the court of appeals

20

addressed certain principal flaws that it saw in the

21

statute, and I wish you -- you could address those.

22

whether there material taken as a whole includes the whole

23

Web site or -- or the article and so forth, and you, I

24

think, took a different position in the Third Circuit than

25

you took here.

First,

And -- and the second is this question of

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

the definition of the commercial use.

2

you address those?

3

MR. OLSON: Yes.

Could you -- could

We -- we submit, and Congress was

4

basing its definitions on the decisions of this Court with

5

respect to taken as a whole, as this Court put it in the, I

6

think it's the Kois case, K-o-i-s case, from Wisconsin, and

7

that comes from -- that comes from the Roth decision of this

8

Court, the material to -- for -- for purposes of the

9

performance of this statute must be taken not only in its

10

content, but in its context.

11

Now, in many cases it won't be necessary to do

12

that, but something that might appear to be harmful in one

13

context, if it's examined as a whole and it turns out to be

14

a part of an art exhibit or a anatomy book or a sex

15

education program, that would -- would have redeeming value.

16

It's this Court's decision that it's the protection of the

17

communicator that the material be looked at as a whole.

18

Congress carefully built that into the statute, and your

19

second point, Justice Kennedy, is commercial purveyors of

20

this -­

21

QUESTION: Well, just -- but -- but before we leave

22

the -- the whole, what is -- your position changed between

23

the Third Circuit and here as to what we should look like,

24

should we look at the whole -- are you saying now we should

25

look at the whole Web site?

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. OLSON: You may look at the whole Web site and

2

-- and -- and it may be appropriate to look at the whole Web

3

site, it may not be necessary.

4

interest.

5

should not be looked at -­

6
7

It may be in the defendant's

We're not suggesting that the whole Web site

QUESTION: But I mean, how -- how is the purveyor
or the -- the broadcaster supposed to know?

8

MR. OLSON: The broadcast -- with respect to the -­

9

QUESTION: I mean, if we can't define what -­

10

MR. OLSON: Well -­

11

QUESTION: -- what the whole means -­

12

MR. OLSON: Well, this Court -- what -- this Court

13

has defined that.

14

in the context it's which -- it's presented.

15

in -­

It is -- requires looking at the material
In addition,

16

QUESTION: But it's presented on a screen.

17

MR. OLSON: It's presented on a screen -­

18

QUESTION: One -- one screen at a time.

19

MR. OLSON: Certainly, Justice Kennedy, but one

20

page in a book is presented at a time, one book in a

21

library, one magazine in a bookstore.

22

QUESTION: Yeah, but as we all know, this -- this

23

is -- a book, we know about book, but the Web site is

24

different, and that's where we're struggling.

25

MR. OLSON: Well, that's right, and we're saying

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

that the entire Web site may be looked at as a whole to see

2

the context in which the material is presented.

3

protections that the Court think are available and should be

4

concluded within the statute to protect the communicator.

5

So if the communicator is accused of putting the material

6

out there that otherwise might fit these definitions, and

7

the person doing the communication said, you have to look at

8

the whole Web site, this was in an art gallery and so forth

9

and those pictures were a part of that exhibit, that's a --

These are

10

that's -- the reason why Congress put that provision in

11

there is that this Court repeatedly said it was necessary to

12

protect First Amendment rights, and in Ginzburg, U.S. v.

13

Ginzburg, the Court said the context might be considered in

14

terms of how the manner is being purveyed, is there

15

pandering going on, is it being put out, is -­

16

QUESTION: But that's not obvious in the text of

17

the statute, because it says, it says any image, any

18

article, any image.

19

whole.

Then it could be any image taken as a

20

MR. OLSON: But -­

21

QUESTION: The question that -- that I have is, you

22

-- you have clarified what the statute means in this

23

respect, you've also said that harmful to minors, the minor

24

in view is the normal 16-year-old, but the statute doesn't

25

say that, and since we're dealing with a content

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

restriction, is it good enough for you to give a narrowing

2

construction of words that are susceptible to a broader

3

meaning?

4

MR. OLSON: The -- I submit that the -- what the -­

5

with the issue of as a whole as a part of the statute, taken

6

in the context which it is given, it -- it -- the -- this is

7

-- this is part 6 of the definition, which is on page 189a

8

of the appendix to the cert petition -- that the -- the

9

context of that is quite clear that the material is -­

10

QUESTION: Well, three -- two -- yeah.

No, it was

11

three, wasn't it, judges on the Court of Appeals for the

12

Third Circuit missed it?

13

MR. OLSON: That's why we're here.

But the -- the

14

fact -- and I -- and I submit this.

15

this Court has repeatedly said, and it said last year in -­

16

in connection with the McCain-Feingold case, that if there's

17

a reasonable construction or a narrowing construction to

18

which the statute is reason -- readily susceptible, the

19

Court will adopt it in order to avoid the constitutional

20

question, but I don't even think that's necessary in this

21

context.

22

In the first place,

The contact of -- context of as a whole comes to

23

this Court from the -- comes to Congress through a series of

24

definitions and actual cases by this Court, so -- and the

25

legislative history is manifestly clear that what Congress

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

was trying to do in this pace -- case -- is to adopt these

2

-- this Court's definitions of those things, and if I can -­

3

QUESTION: Why did you -­

4

MR. OLSON: Those were book cases.

5

QUESTION: -- pick 16-year-olds instead of 17-year-

6

olds if you want to use the old -- the oldest minors?

7

-- how -- how did you come up with 16-year-olds?

Where

8

MR. OLSON: Because this Court -­

9

QUESTION: And I mean, you know, maybe you -- you

10

won the battle by losing the war.

11

MR. OLSON: Well -­

12

QUESTION: You -- you're going to allow to come in

13

without any restriction under this statute for a 5-year-old

14

anything that wouldn't be -- wouldn't be bad for a 16-year-

15

old.

16

MR. OLSON: Well, there's two -­

17

QUESTION: Is that a great victory?

18

MR. OLSON: There's two answers to that, Justice

19

Scalia.

20

does not require impossible definitions.

21

puts a person reasonably on notice is an appropriate way to

22

go, and what -- the -- the reason why it was 16 rather than

23

17, of course, is because this Court criticized the previous

24

statute because it drew the line at a different age.

25

As this Court has repeatedly said, the Constitution
What is -- what

It would be impossible, I submit, for Congress to

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

select a different age for every different piece of

2

material.

3

problem, the material that even with respect to 16-year-olds

4

meets the standards set out in the statute.

5

--

6

What Congress was trying to get at was the worst

QUESTION: How do we know that?

That at least

I -- I doubt that

7

very much.

8

deal of stuff that might be okay for 16-year-olds not to -­

9

not -- not to be shown -­

I -- I think Congress probably wanted a good

10

MR. OLSON: No, as a matter of fact -­

11

QUESTION: -- to really young children.

12

MR. OLSON: As a matter of fact, Congress was very

13

clear that what it was adopting is what this Court had

14

previously considered in the American Booksellers case and

15

those blinder racks and the -- and the definition that came

16

out of the American Booksellers case and the subsequent

17

Fourth Circuit definition of that term in that case, of

18

which this Court subsequently denied cert.

19

blinder rack cases are exactly cited in the legislative

20

history.

21

Those bookseller

This is a remarkable instance of where Congress

22

went through all of the things that the Court identified as

23

problems with the previous statute, grappled with each of

24

these definitions, adopted Court-approved definitions,

25

standards, and limitations with respect to what this Court

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

has agreed is a compelling problem.

2

If I can return to Justice Kennedy's concern about

3

the issue of -- take -- the commercial pornographers, the

4

statute is very clear that it refers to people that are in

5

the business of profiting from this material, and then the

6

Court -- the statute goes on to say what is the business of

7

being engaged in this and says that someone that takes time,

8

effort, or labor in the regular course of a business of -­

9

of profiting from the transmission of this material.

10

So the legislative history, the previous iteration

11

of the problem in this Court makes it clear that what

12

Congress was concerned about and was -- was not trying to

13

capture with this statute the person that occasionally

14

transmitted a -- a photograph or an image, but someone who

15

is in the business of doing this on a regular basis for

16

profit.

17

QUESTION: Well, but the -- the doing -- the this

18

is having the whole Web site, and -- and I, you know, I -- I

19

concede it'd be a very difficult task if we told the

20

Congress you come -- you come up with some definition of the

21

commercial pornographer.

22

that this is very -- very sweeping.

23

aside the question of non-profit associations and so forth,

24

people that have these Web sites will tell you that 100

25

percent of what they do is for profit.

On the other hand, it seems to me
We -- even leaving

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. OLSON: Well, the answer to that, Justice

2

Kennedy, is the -- the fact that this is not any -- that

3

that definition, what the Congress adopted at the suggestion

4

of this Court, was the same definition that this Court had

5

approved in prior contexts with respect to obscenity, 18

6

U.S.C. 1466, and that definition, commercial use of

7

obscenity, is something that prosecutors and courts have

8

been dealt -- been dealing with for a couple of -- for over,

9

well over a generation, for several decades.

10

So -­

QUESTION: Mr. Olson, may I ask you a question

11

about the -- on the -- the meaning of this very provision?

12

Supposing a beer company or a cigarette company used for

13

advertising purposes regularly used material that would fit

14

the definition.

15

Would they be violating the statute?

MR. OLSON: Yes, I believe they would, Justice

16

Stevens, that if the idea is to sell -- to use the material

17

that fits the definition, I keep saying the word pornography

18

because I want to use the shorthand, and that is to make

19

commercial use of it by making money out of it, whether they

20

sell -­

21
22

QUESTION: Well, they're making money out of the
sale of -- of the product, which itself is not pornographic.

23

MR. OLSON: That's -­

24

QUESTION: But -- but if it's regular advertising,

25

you think that would -- that would meet it?

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. OLSON: Yes, I -- Congress would not have

2

wanted to create that massive loophole, because the people

3

that are -- this is a multi-billion dollar business, the

4

people that are doing it would readily adapt to that type of

5

a loophole.

6

respondents is that -- and the, and by the Third Circuit -­

7

is that somehow Congress should have required that this

8

would be the primary business that the person was engaged

9

in.

The other one that was suggested by the

Again, that would have been a massive loophole subject

10

to constant litigation over what was the primary business

11

and whether a person's surrounded the harmful material with

12

an acre or two of unharmful material.

13

What Congress was getting at is that people that

14

are in the business, knowing and knowing the character of

15

the material, two other terms that are in the statute, that

16

are making money distributing this material and who won't

17

take the steps necessary to protect minors from them.

18

With respect to the argument that the respondents

19

make and the court of appeals focused on that blocking at

20

the home might somehow be a problem, Congress carefully

21

considered that, decided it would not be an acceptable

22

solution, except that it did at the same time enact -- that

23

it enacted COPA, required that the Internet service

24

providers make that type of information available to people

25

in their homes so that that could be in addition to what

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

COPA requires.

2

The fact is that blocking material in the home is

3

both underinclusive and overinclusive.

4

consumer to go out and buy a product and spend money to

5

adapt it to technological improvements that are happening

6

all the times, and it's readily avoidable.

7

this again is outside the record, but I did this, anyone can

8

do this, the same experiment over the weekend.

9

Google and I typed in disable filter and you push the button

It requires the

I did the same,

and you will get a screen full of programs that will tell

11

you step by step how to dismantle the computer so your

12

parents won't know about it.

13

put it back on.

14

It is that easy, and you can

These things are readily avoidable.

So the burden

15

that Congress was -- was -- the burden that Congress imposed

16

at the suggestion of this Court is to put the burden on the

17

person or persons making money on a regular basis from this

18

product to take the minimal steps necessary to prevent the

19

damage that's done every day by minors by allowing people to

20

use mechanisms that are already in place.

21

22

mechanism, that's another thing that -- that anyone can

check out.

25

mention in the congressional history which will provide an

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

adult identification at a relatively nominal cost, I think

2

it was 19.95 for a several-month period or something like

3

that, and the availability is such that the steps that can

4

be followed take a matter of less than a couple of minutes.

5

So in the privacy of the home, the adult who wants

6

material protected by the Constitution, in order to avoid

7

damage to children in the privacy of the home with statutory

8

protection as to anonymity, the -- the problem can -- it -­

9

it cannot be totally solved, but this is an important major

10

step and this is an example of Congress following the

11

directions of this Court as to how constitutionally to do

12

it.

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance
of my time.

15

QUESTION: Very well, General Olson.

16

Ms. Beeson, we'll hear from you.

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN E. BEESON

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19
20
21

MS. BEESON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
COPA violates the First Amendment for two

22

independent reasons.

23

suppresses a wide range of protected speech between adults

24

on the Web, and second, the Government has a range of more

25

effective, less restrictive tools available to protect

First, it is a criminal statute that

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

minors.

2

speech that is affected by this statute defy the law's plain

3

language, the record, and plain common sense.

4

The Government's attempt to narrow the range of

Even under the Government's interpretation, COPA

5

criminalizes speech that under any definition adults have

6

the right to access.

7

description of nudity or even a description or depiction of

8

the female breast.

9

It criminalizes a depiction or even a

It does not just cover sexual conduct.

QUESTION: Now, I thought what it said is it picks

10

up the definition that this Court has used for obscenity.

11

thought that definition was primarily an appeal to the

12

prurient interest and it cannot have any -- it has to lack,

13

taken as a whole, serious literary, artistic, political, or

14

scientific value, and it adds the word, for minors.

15

16- or 17-year-old, I'm not sure there'd be much difference.

I

For a

16

MS. BEESON: I -­

17

QUESTION: And -- and so, I looked through all your

18

stuff, or not all of it, but some of it, and I'd like you to

19

point out for me, what is the material there that has that

20

serious scientific value, which you have quite a lot of -­

21

MS. BEESON: Yes.

22

QUESTION: -- but that the statute would forbid?

23

MS. BEESON: Yes.

Two points, Your Honor.

First,

24

the obscenity statute actually covers only sexual conduct.

25

It does not cover mere depictions of -- of nudity and it

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

does not cover just an image of the female breast, so I

2

think that that's an important difference.

3

QUESTION: It has to be an image or whatever image

4

they are that appeal to the prurient interest.

5

me is material that does not communicate.

Now, that to

6

MS. BEESON: Yes.

7

QUESTION: It is material that is looking for a

8

kind of emotional response, period.

9

trying to elicit a certain emotional response, all right?

10

And it lacks serious artistic or cultural or other value,

11

all right?

12

because most of yours I think didn't fit that definition.

13

In fact, I couldn't find one that did fit it.

14

MS. BEESON: Your Honor -­

15

QUESTION: So I want you to tell me which is the

16

No communication and

Now, what is the material that you point to,

one that fits it.

17

MS. BEESON: Yes, and, Your Honor, the question

18

ultimately is what a speaker on the Web who communicates

19

material like this will do, what they think is covered by

20

the law, whether they will self-censor everything they think

21

--

22
23
24
25

QUESTION: Oh, I would imagine it's what we say is
covered by the law.
MS. BEESON: Your Honor, I don't think so, under
this Court's precedents.

In other words, if the -- if the

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

record shows, and if the law covers, material that clearly

2

has value for adults but lacks value for minors, there has

3

to be some distinction there or otherwise this turns into

4

the obscenity statute.

5

words, there is material that has -­

6
7

There is no difference.

QUESTION: You're going a little fast.
slow down, Ms. Beeson?

Would you

MS. BEESON: Sure.

QUESTION: -- clause.

10

In other

MS. BEESON: Sure, sure, Your Honor, of course.

11

The point is that the serious value for minors clause does

12

not protect as much material as the serious value for adults

13

clause in the obscenity statute.

14

true, and in fact, as a society, just even using common

15

sense -­

16
17

That by definition must be

QUESTION: Did you get my question?

I wanted you,

I was serious in my question.

18

MS. BEESON: Yes.

19

QUESTION: I want to know, I would like some

citations.

You don't have to -­

21

MS. BEESON: Absolutely.

22

QUESTION: -- hold it up.

23

MS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION: But I -- I want to know what you think,

25

in other words, are your prime examples, because I'm tempted

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

to look at them, and if I thought that this statute didn't

2

cover it, why not say so?

3

the ACLU is worried about, given the Government's effort,

problem?

6

Why not say all these things that

Would that take care of your

But tell me which they are.
MS. BEESON: Yes, let me do that.

First, there are

7

numerous discussions in the -- in the record of lesbian and

8

gay sexual pleasure and the pleasure of sex outdoors.

9

is not sex education materials.

These are materials

10

intended for adults which explicitly discuss sexual

11

pleasure.

This

Let me give a few citations:

PlanetOut, in the

13

joint appendix, 658 to 69; BlackStripe, the joint appendix,

14

753 to 57; and the Susie Bright column.

15

therapist, she is -- she talks about sexual pleasure.

is not talking about educational material.

17

her columns are to invite adults to discuss and to read

18

about sexual pleasure if they want -­

QUESTION: Exactly, and I don't think that that's

20

prurient.

21

22

supposed to be part of a sexual response, all right?

23

They're night and day different.

I think a discussion about sex is a totally

25

QUESTION: Now -- now you tell me why that isn't

so.

2

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, let me put this another

3

way.

that have been put in by the Government are of images.

5

don't know what else could be covered that is written text

6

that, you know, other than our client's material, in other

7

words, what is left.

they are prurient discussions, they are intended for adults,

they have value for adults, but they lack value for minors.

This statute covers written text.

All of the exhibits

That is what they are.

They are -­

That is the concern.

12

I

It's a very big concern.

There are a

And as a society, again, there's a lot of material

value for adults and lacking value for even older minors.

going to be very, very worried.

that you cannot make it a crime to display material to

You can go to jail, not because you made that

The second option.

That is

You're worried, you don't want

8

to go to jail, you self-censor.

9

self-censored, adults had the right to access.

Everything that you have
It violates

10

the First Amendment for the Government to do this through

11

the statute.

12

The third option is that you can set up costly

13

screens, which the record shows drive away your users.

14

district court and the court of appeals also specifically

15

found that because of the risk of criminal penalties, it's

16

quite likely that you never get to the defenses because the

17

vast majority of rational speakers, when faced with this

18

choice, are going to self-censor, and that is speech that

19

adults had the right to get.

The

20

This Court, for that reason -­

21

QUESTION: You're talking about self-censoring.

22

You're meaning an interpretation of the statute that is not

23

warranted by the -- the proper interpretation, I take it?

24
25

MS. BEESON: No, I'm not.
Honor.

I -- no, I'm not, Your

I think this is very different than the -- than that

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

problem, the self-censorship problem with the obscenity

2

statute, and here's why.

3

you self-censor material that is actually obscene, there's

4

no First Amendment problem.

Under the obscenity statute, if

5

QUESTION: That's the whole point of the thing.

6

MS. BEESON: Exactly.

There's no First Amendment

7

problem.

8

under COPA that we can all agree is harmful to minors,

9

whatever that is, it's harmful to minors, you have self-

That speech is illegal.

If you self-censor speech

10

censored material that adults have the right to access.

11

That's the fundamental difference, and that is why this

12

self-censorship is problem with this statute is so much

13

broader than it -- than it could ever be in the obscenity

14

statute.

15

Now, you also have -­

16

QUESTION: If -- if you run that self-censor, I

17

mean, you -- you could not have any laws protect.

18

suppose the laws that require certain categories of

19

materials to be put in these, what do we call, the blinder,

20

blinder racks, I -- I suppose that -- that's invalid on the

21

same basis because those magazines that want to appear in

22

the general readership rack will self-censor them -­

23

themselves so that they won't be put in there, right?

24

all of those, and I think every state has laws like that,

25

they're all invalid because of self-censorship?

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

I -- I

So

1

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, we think that -- first of

2

all, this Court has never upheld an -- a harmful to minors

3

display statute, and in fact -­

4

QUESTION: I understand we haven't, but what --

5

what's your view?

6

they're all bad.

The argument you're making suggests that

7

MS. BEESON: We think that that is one of the three

8

First Amendment burdens that these kinds of statutes impose.

9

The first one is the self-censorship problem.

10
11
12

The second

one -­
QUESTION: All right.

But that alone is not

enough, you think?

13

MS. BEESON: We think that it would be enough -­

14

QUESTION: Okay.

15

MS. BEESON: -- but the point is under COPA -­

16

QUESTION: Then all the blinder racks are bad?

17

MS. BEESON: And under -- under this law -- under

18

this law, Your -- Your Honor, there are two additional

19

burdens which are much greater than the online blinder rack

20

statutes, and in fact, it's quite notable that even though

21

some states, it's about half of the states that have display

22

statutes as opposed to statutes like Ginsberg that make it a

23

crime to simply sell directly to a child material that's

24

harmful to minors, those same states that have passed and in

25

some cases upheld offline display statutes have now struck

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

down online display statutes because they have reached the

2

same conclusion that the district court and the appellate

3

court in this case found and that is that there is -­

4

QUESTION: Well, their supreme courts did, their

5

supreme courts did.

6

judgment of the people of the states by their legislature.

7

You're saying that -- that there were state supreme courts

8

that struck it down, right?

9

I mean, don't represent it as a

MS. BEESON: I'm saying that there are -- there

10

were Federal courts that have struck down now seven state

11

online harmful to minor statutes because they have

12

recognized the distinction between those statutes in the

13

online context and the offline context, and let me just get

14

to that second problem, you know, self-censorship being the

15

first problem, self-censorship of speech that under any

16

definition is protected for adults.

17

The second one, the -- let's just assume that you

18

-- that you want to go ahead and try to set up these

19

screens, first of all, a credit card is a form of payment,

20

it is not an ID.

21

ID if you're a young-looking adult and the bookstore owner

22

is not quite sure that you're -- you're an adult yet.

23

is a matter of every single adult having to -- to provide

24

their credit card to a Web site every time they visit a new

25

Web site.

This is not just a matter of flashing your

The -­

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

This

1
2
3

QUESTION: But there's a -- there's an alternative,
the ID, you -- it doesn't have to be a credit card.
MS. BEESON: Your Honor, there is an alternative in

4

the statute.

5

ID, the primary way to get that is through a credit card.

6

So another problem you have very similar to the problem

7

identified by this Court in Reno v. ACLU is that, you know,

8

almost all adults without credit cards have no way to access

9

this speech at all, and again, you don't even -- you don't

10

even get to this problem if, of course, the Web speaker has

11

chosen the first option and has self-censored and not even

12

tried to set up the screens.

13

What the record shows is that to get an adult

So the other -- the -- the other thing that's very

14

different, of course, about the blinder rack statutes is

15

that none of them required the adults to actually register

16

or disclose their identity.

17

transaction, a permanent record of the transaction, and the

18

-- the potential for abuse, because they are a form of

19

payment, is much greater than merely flashing an ID.

20

Credit cards create a permanent

QUESTION: Yes, but the Government says that

21

there's a statutory protection that they cannot -- that the

22

-- the person who gets the information can't pass it on to

23

third parties.

24
25

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, there was actually -­
there actually was a similar protection in the Denver Area

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

case, which this Court found irrelevant given the remaining

2

burden on -- on adults having to identify themselves before

3

they seek access.

4

5

similar burdens on adult speech.

greater because the quantity and diversity of speech

affected is much greater and the number of users affected is

greater.

I would also like to point out that there's -­

19

QUESTION: When -- what -­

20

MS. BEESON: -- protected speech anonymously, but

21

that is not really what's at issue here.

22

what the effect of the law is on protected speech for

23

adults, and what the anonymity cases show is that if you

24

have to give up your anonymity, a lot of people are going to

25

be deterred, and that's what the record in this case shows

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

What's at issue is

1

too.

2

General Olson acted as if there was nothing in the

3

record about the number of times.

4

lot in the record.

5

In fact, there is quite a

QUESTION: Well, you -- you say you're not relying

6

on what you refer to as anonymity cases for this

7

proposition?

8
9

MS. BEESON: I'm saying that I think that those
cases are relevant only to the extent that they show that

10

anonymity often deters -- that the -- the loss of anonymity

11

will deter viewers.

12

even just the -- the loss of anonymity that's the problem,

13

it's also the stigma of being associated with material

14

that's been labeled by the Government as illegal, and that

15

was a stigma that the Court also found relevant in striking

16

down the Denver Area case.

Here there is evidence, and it isn't

17

I wanted to just quick -­

18

QUESTION: If -- if it really -- if it really were

19

illegal, then the stigma would be irrelevant, don't you

20

think?

21

MS. BEESON: The -- the -- if it were illegal to?

22

QUESTION: Suppose you were stigmatized by having

23

subscribed to poor -- to obscenity.

that.

and in Playboy.

point.

anonymity, and what's the third?

The first is there's too great a risk of self-

9

They have the right to

The second is a screening requires loss of

MS. BEESON: The -- the third was the four -- first
point I made, Your Honor, which is that if you -- the

10

defenses don't help you at all if you take a risk and -- and

11

assume that your speech is protected and in fact the

because you displayed it to an adult.

You know, you're Susie Bright,

The defenses don't help you and you're going to

17

QUESTION: Well, that seems to me just really much,

18

very much like the point that -- that the statute sweeps too

19

broadly, there's a risk of too great self-censorship.

20

That's really the same point, isn't it?

21

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, I -- I don't think it is

22

the same point.

23

distinct point, because the point is the speaker has two

24

choices.

25

speech, in which case they go to jail.

I really think it's a -- it's a very

They can either take a risk and display the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

They go to jail not

1

because they gave it to a child, that's the only kind of a

2

statute this Court has upheld.

3

they upheld in Ginsberg is that you can make it a crime to

4

deliberately sell this material to the child.

5

all the -- all the Web publisher has done under this statute

6

that sends him to jail is to simply make it available to the

7

general reading public.

9

QUESTION: All right.

That's the -- that's what

All the -­

Suppose -- what in your

opinion is the right way for Congress to go about this?

10

That is, I assume, and you may not assume, but assume with

11

me that Congress is not interested in Susie Bright.

12

all fine.

13

What they're interested in are -- is the professional

14

pornographer and we know who that is and we know what it

15

looks like, and it's too tough to go after them with the

16

obscenity statutes because they say artistic, whatever it

17

is, there's a set of reasons that hasn't been successful.

18

That's

They're not really interested in your examples.

So here's their solution.

It's called zoning.

We

19

won't stop people from looking at the worst stuff if they

20

want to and if they're adults, but you have to take the

21

subway and go out of Times Square, of if you're on the

22

Internet, you have to identify that you're not a child.

23

Now, we know that's a burden, but it's far more consistent

24

with the First Amendment to let people look at anything they

25

want including this worst possible stuff, as long as they're

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

not hurting anybody else, and the way to deal with this is

2

to zone just like we use to do in libraries.

3

see the stuff that's locked up, you have to go to the

4

librarian and identify yourself and show you're not a child

5

and she'll open it with a key, that used to happen, and you

6

could go look at it, all right?

7
8
9

That's Congress' solution.
good solution, what is?

If you want to

Now, if that is not a

Is there no solution?

MS. BEESON: Yes, there are a number of solutions

10

which Congress has now passed which don't present the -- the

11

problems that this statute does.

12

statute, it's a criminal statute, and because it's a

13

criminal statute it's far more likely to lead to the self-

14

censorship that -- that causes the big problem here.

15

This is not a zoning

We now have a Federal filtering law that this

16

Court upheld, so any child that's accessing the Internet in

17

a school or a public library has already -- is protected

18

from most of these images.

19

important cites in the record that I want to mention here,

20

the Government put in more exhibits -­

One of the most -- one of the

QUESTION: Your organization didn't -- didn't
support that -- that statute.

23

MS. BEESON: I'm sorry.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MS. BEESON: Yeah.

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: Also, what else, because as you know

2

from things I've written, I'm very skeptical about the

3

ability of filtering to deal with millions of families where

4

there are no parents at home during the day and it's very

5

tough.

6

what's two?

7

So -- so that's one.

I'll look at that.

What's --

MS. BEESON: If I could just mention the cite to

8

the record, Your Honor, because I think it's very important.

9

The Government put in a lot of sexually explicit images as

10

their exhibits in this case.

11

of the major filtering products blocked every one of the

12

images that they submitted as being a problem in this case.

They stipulated that every one

13

QUESTION: Where's that at in the record?

14

MS. BEESON: That is in the joint appendix

15

beginning at page 170, that's the joint stipulation between

16

the parties, numbers 45 to 47.

17

endorsement for filtering software, and again, the district

That is a pretty ringing

QUESTION: If it's working what do you do about the

20

Solicitor General's contention that it's easy to turn the

21

filters off?

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, first of all, that is not

23

in the record.

24

25

COPA, and the reason that they're more effective -­

show from the record, that it is -- it is not easy to turn

QUESTION: -- about how easy it is to disable them,

did it?
MS. BEESON: Because the Government didn't put on
any evidence, which is why he said he had to go outside the

1

record to make that point, when we have only the record to

2

-- to base the decision on here.

3

the other options that are available, the other things that

4

Congress can do, one that I want to mention is a new statute

5

that was passed, 18 U.S.C. -- I believe it's 2252(b) -- it

6

gets at the Whitehouse.com problem.

7

penalizes sites that knowingly use misleading domain names,

8

like Whitehouse.com, in order to lure children to this sites

9

inadvertently.

10
11

Justice Breyer, to get to

This is a law that

That is another law -­

QUESTION: Statute -- has that statute been
challenged yet?

12

MS. BEESON: That -- that statute has not been

13

challenged.

14

is -­

It is on the books now, and -- and therefore it

15

QUESTION: You think that's a good one, though?

16

MS. BEESON: It is certainly narrower, Your Honor,

17
18
19

than this statute.
QUESTION: I understand that, but you think it's
good, so we can count on the fact that that one's okay?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. BEESON: I will argue only that it's -­

22

QUESTION: You will demur.

23

MS. BEESON: -- clearly narrower.

And one of the

24

reasons that it's narrower, all -- all jokes aside, is

25

because it gets more clearly at -- at what the statute is

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

aiming to get at, which is, you know, luring inadvertent

2

viewers, especially minors, to particular sites, whereas

3

this -- this law makes it a crime for anyone, any individual

4

running a small business, you know, Mitch Tepper, our client

5

who runs a sexual health network -­

6

QUESTION: No, no, I understand it's a lot

7

narrower.

8

want to be sure you don't stop before I've listed all the

9

alternatives that you think are possible.

10

I've got -- I agree with you about that.

I just

MS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor, and thank you for

11

returning me to my -- to my task there.

12

law that was passed the same time that COPA was passed -­

13

passed, which requires Internet service providers to give

14

all customers information about their filters.

15

Another one is a

Another misconception I think left by General

16

Olson, you don't have to go out and buy another product.

17

The record shows that all of the major filtering, all of the

18

major Internet service providers provide these parental

19

controls as a -- as a default for parents.

20

you set up your account with AOL, it asks you right then and

21

there, you don't have to pay extra, whether you want to

22

install the parental controls.

When you -- when

23

There is also a new law -­

24

QUESTION: But why did Congress not think these

25

were adequate?

I can't understand it.

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

I mean, if that's so

1

obvious, why -- why didn't Congress see that, that obvious

2

fact?

3

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, part of the problem, of

4

course, is that most of these laws that I'm mentioning were

5

passed after COPA was passed.

6

in this debate when the Internet was not as well understood

7

as it is now.

8

thought up since then have been better, they've been

9

narrower, and they have had less -­

10

COPA was passed very early on

Frankly, the -- the solutions that it has

QUESTION: Screening existed.

They certainly had,

11

you know, you're relying heavily on that.

12

technologies existed and Congress surely considered them and

13

thought it was inadequate for some reason.

Those -- those

14

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, the record in the case

15

shows that it's at least as adequate and where, as here,

16

there's a record that shows that there is a broad chilling

17

effect on protected speech for adults because this is a

18

criminal statute, those -- those tools are -- are -­

19

QUESTION: But you're back to your first point now.

20

I've got down filters, I understand that, and I've got the

21

domain names, and I want to know if there's anything else.

22

MS. BEESON: Yes.

There are two other points I

23

would like to make on that.

24

now created something called the Dot Kids domain, which is a

25

safe environment in which there are sites that are reviewed

One is there's -- Congress has

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

that are intended just for children.

2

can interact with the filters in a way that allows a parent

3

to set up the AOL account, for example, so that their

4

younger child has access only to the sites in the Dot Kids

5

domain.

6

That Dot Kids domain

QUESTION: What -- what are -- what are the age

7

limits that are -- are specified there?

8

for the 6-, 7-year-old group and then up to the 15-, 14-,

9

15-year-old group?

10

Is there something

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, I believe, I don't have

11

that statute in front of me, but I believe that that -- that

12

the idea is to set up a safe environment for children 12 and

13

under, that that -- that's the way that -- that it's defined

14

there.

15

vigorous enforcement of the obscenity law could solve some

16

of these problems.

17

and I think that before -­

18

And then finally, of course, as we mentioned,

The Government has not been doing that,

QUESTION: But that, of course, in a sense is

19

contrary to the -- I mean, from a First Amendment point of

20

view, isn't it preferable to draw obscenity prosecution

21

lines favorably towards free speech?

22

mention that because that seems to me the basic First

23

Amendment dilemma that I am having, that it is actually

24

preferable to lean in the direction of letting the adults go

25

and see anything they want, virtually anything.

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

And that's -- I

But that

1

means that there'd be some burden attached, and the burden

2

that's attached is the key to the spot -- locked room in the

3

library, the taking New York Times -- Times Square and

4

moving it out to Yonkers and some place, and here that you

5

have to identify yourself as an adult.

6

That's the true dilemma I'm having, so when you

7

suddenly say, oh well, let's, you know, launch a crusade

8

against the obscenity, from a First Amendment perspective,

9

that might be worse.

So what do you think?

10

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, obscenity -­

11

QUESTION: You don't really want that anyway, do

12

you?

13
14

MS. BEESON: Obscenity is by definition speech that
is not protected by the First Amendment.

15

QUESTION: Yes, but there are a lot of hard lines

16

in this area, and a set of prosecutors -­

17

MS. BEESON: There -­

18

QUESTION: -- who are now determined to go, to -­

19

to -- to crusade in this area could draw a lot of those

20

lines differently from say you would.

21

MS. BEESON: Well, and I -- and I, of course, am

22

not trying to say that those prosecutions wouldn't ever

23

raise a First Amendment issue.

24

would.

25

in every single application.

Of course they would -- they

But this statute raises a First Amendment question
Every single time this statute

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

is applied, it violates the First Amendment because the only

2

options available to speakers would either put them in jail

3

for making their speech generally available to the public or

4

-- or prevent adults from accessing that -- that protected

5

speech because either the speaker has self-censored or

6

they've put it all behind a screen that the record shows

7

drives -- drives away the users, and I -- I think I was

8

going to make just a another cite to the record that I think

9

is an important one to note, and that is that the

10

Government's own expert conceded that thousands of users

11

would be deterred from any single Web site as the result of

12

any registration system, and that is, again, similar to the

13

evidence that the Court relied on in striking down the

14

statutes regulating indecency in cable television in both

15

the Playboy and the Denver Area cases.

16

This statute has greater problems because it's a

17

criminal statute.

18

civil penalties that -- oh, I thought I had that cite to

19

give you but I actually don't -- I'll try to -- I'll try to

20

find it in a moment.

21

Those statutes, of course, just involve

The -- the district court in its findings of facts

22

specifically noted that point about the Government's expert

23

conceding thousands of -- of users.

24
25

QUESTION: But, just clarify it for a minute.

The

reason that thousands are deterred are, one, they don't want

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

to self-identify, and two, they're unable to have credit

2

cards or something of that kind.

3

Those are the two reasons?

MS. BEESON: Yes, and they don't want to self-

4

identify because they're too embarrassed or because they

5

don't want to be stigmatized by being associated with the

6

content.

7

There is an additional reason, which the record

8

showed, which I think is important to close with, and that

9

is the nature of this medium.

This is an -- a wholly

10

unprecedented medium of communication.

11

12

entry.

13

through this linking process.

14

This Court found

It has extremely low barriers to

It allows users to access millions of sites just

The record also showed that by setting up these

15

barriers that kind of destroyed the nature of accessing

16

information on the Internet.

17

QUESTION: Would you tell me your response to

18

General Olson's argument that the self-identification

19

problem is not serious because there's a restraint on the -­

20

on the transmitter's use of that private information?

21
22
23

MS. BEESON: I -- I'm sorry, I didn't follow you,
Justice Stevens.
QUESTION: Well, his answer to your self-

24

identification problem is that self-identification to

25

someone who by law is not allowed to pass that self­

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

identification material on to third parties.

2
3

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, this Court has -- has
never upheld any statute which -­

4
5

QUESTION: But why shouldn't we uphold that
argument?

6

MS. BEESON: Because it's so clear that it would

7

deter adults from accessing protected speech.

8

that is -­

9

I think that

QUESTION: But I don't see if you rely on your

10

reason for deterrence is fear of self-identification, and if

11

the statute makes that fear groundless, I'm not sure your

12

argument is persuasive.

13

MS. BEESON: Oh, let me then cite to one more

14

thing, which I meant to get to before and I didn't, and that

15

is that there is a very big loophole in the privacy

16

protection in the law and that is -- it's under (d), let me

17

quickly find it -- under (d)(1), there was an exception --

18

(d)(2), exceptions to the privacy protection, any -- any

19

person making a disclosure is not covered, I mean, can make

20

the disclosure as long as it's necessary to conduct a

21

legitimate business activity related to making the

22

communication.

23

That's a fairly big loophole that I think would

24

make a lot of users very nervous, and of course, the -- the

25

initial problem is that they don't want to give their credit

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

card or their -- or their ID even to the Web site.

2

these are Web sites that they've never seen before.

3

surfing the Web.

4

-- they're unknown Web sites.

5

I mean,
They're

They're not trusted local stores, they're

QUESTION: Yes, but -- but millions of users of the

6

Web give their credit card number in order to buy books or

7

something else that's for sale.

8

that's such a terrible invasion of privacy.

9

I don't understand why

MS. BEESON: Your Honor, in fact, what the record

10

showed in this case was that the only time that Internet

11

users were comfortable giving their credit card was when

12

they were ready to make a purchase.

13

as General Olson conceded, to just making the speech

14

available with -- surrounded by advertising.

15

did that, it doesn't just apply to speakers who are selling

16

their speech on the Web.

This law applies to -­

Anybody who

17

In closing, I just want to say again that this

18

Court has repeatedly held that the Government can't burn

19

down the house to roast the pig, especially with so many

20

other tools available to protect minors more effectively

21

than this statute does.

protecting children.

15

don't think it's susceptible to that construction.

16

I wanted to go back to where Justice Breyer

17

started, what would be covered by the statute?

18

given by the respondents were addressed in the Government's

brief and all three of the -- all of those examples we don't

20

believe are covered by the statute.

21

within, doesn't fit within the prurient interest in the -­

22

and would be defended on -- this is reminiscent of what the

23

Court was facing in the American Booksellers case, and the

24

respondents here were involved in that one as an amicus,

25

where 16 examples were cited as the house was going to fall

The examples

This Court decided to remand that to the -- the

3

Virginia Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court found

4

that none of the 16 parade of horribles would be even

5

covered by the statute.

6

flies in the face of the requirement by this Court to find a

7

reasonable, a construction of the statute that would be, to

8

which it would be reasonably susceptible that would deal

9

with those constitutional problems.

10

That's this all over again, and it

And -- and these definitions, these definitions

11

have already been approved with respect to minors in the

can get them with a check, and as we point out in footnote 2

20

so you don't have to necessarily use a credit card to do

21

that.

3

The most important point here, with respect to

4

alternatives, Congress considered, as this Court suggested

5

it should, the various alternatives.

6

report's good, but the House report, 775, which is cited all

7

over the briefs on pages 16 through 20 considered all of

8

these examples, the tagging, the filtering and so forth and

9

went through all of the reasons why Congress found that they

The House, the Senate

10

would not be effective and that what COPA was providing

11

would be effective, that there were costs, the burden should

12

be on the commercial purveyor of the material and so forth.

13

Congress went through all of these things and made specific

14

findings.

15

At the end of the day, it's important to emphasize

16

this is a facial challenge to a statute constructed

17

according to this Court's guidance, according to this

18

Court's decisions as to how to deal with a very serious

19

national problem.

20

purveyor of this material must know what's being done, he

21

must be engaged in the regular course of business, and I

can't recall -- I think it was you, Justice Breyer -- who

asked the question, how else could Congress have done it?
