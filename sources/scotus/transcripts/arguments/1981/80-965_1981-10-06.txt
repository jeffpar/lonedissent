CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Texaco against Short and the consolidated case.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. CARROLL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. CARROLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Court, we present here today four constitutional issues

8 involving an

Indiana statute.

9 procedural due process,
10 impairment

These issues relate to

taking, equal protection and

of contracts.
Because of the shortness of time of the argument,

11
12 I would
13 due

We will hear arguments next

like to limit my argument to two issues, procedural

process and taking.
The nature of the interest which is involved and

14

15 which we say has been unlawfully and unconstitutionally
16 extinguished by the state of Indiana

18 gas and

is a fee simple mineral

the state of Indiana dealing with oil,

coal.

19

Under Indiana state property law, those fee simple

20 mineral interests have been determined to be vested property
21 interests,

separate and distinct from the surface ownership

They’ve also been determined to be

QUESTION;

Well,

that's part of Indiana property

3 law , isn *t it?
4

MB. CARROLL;

Not prior to the passage of this

5 act, Justice Rehnquist.
6

QUESTION;

Well, so you would say this act is

7 perfectly all right prospectively but not retroactively.
8

NR. CARROLL;

In terms of prospectively, on any

9 deeds which are created after the date of the act, I don't
10 think, there *s any question about it being consitutional and
11 valid.

Yes, sir.

It is the retroactive nature of it and

12 the lack of notice inherent within the statute that we think
13 has the constitutional flaw.
14

QUESTION;

But you don't have a notice in any

15 statute of limitations, do you?

To take a typical state

16 statute of limitation for adverse possession for real
17 property, open and notorious possession for ten years.

When

18 that time is run, title changes and there isn't any notice
19 that you get.
20

MR. CARROLL;

That's correct.

21 not similar, Justice Rehnquist,

We think this is

to a statute of limitations

22 because it is essentially different in its character and
23 primarily different because the intent of the statute, as we
24 see it both in terms of what briefs have been filed on
25 behalf of the Appellees and the state as well as the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 decision of

the Indiana Supreme Court was, to extinguish

2 these interests, and the notice provision, the grace period
3 provision,

was merely incidental to that but it was net with

4 the intent of preserving the interest.
5

Now, statutes of limitation, by their very nature,

6 go to the question of retaining the integrity of the
7 judicial process.

They're saying that we don't want courts

8 to make

judgments about matters which are stale causes of

9 action.

Here, there never was a cause of action dealing

10 with this property

But Indiana, in effect then, has given

more than you say a statute of limitations would.

13

SR. CARROLL:

QUESTION:

They've given you a grace period.
They have given us a grace period,

18 period.

requires a grace

It is true that the cases say that there is no

19 vested right in a statute of limitation.
20

We say there is a

vested right in this property which is involved here, but in

21 terms of statutes of limitations,

everybody understands that

22 a time is running on a cause of action.

And you have to

23 understand there is a time limitation after which it runs
24 out .
25

That was not true of the interests that are

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 involved here prior to

the passage of this act.

And we

2 think that the purpose of a statute of limitations is to
3

retain the integrity of the judicial process, is a far cry

4

from the statute we have here, which deals with an intent to

5

extinguish a valid property right interest, only because the

6 state determines that they think it could be better
7

8
9
10

developed by somebody else.
If you start with the premise that you're dealing
with a vested property right, and if you say that this
statute is intended to extinguish that right, -- and

11 throughout you will see that that is shown
12
13

to be the intent

of the statute, to extinguish that right.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Carroll, suppose it were a

14

proceeding between the mineral owner and the surface owner,

15

who I gather is the beneficiary of this statute, say to

16

build a quiet title brought by the mineral owner against the

17

surface owner.

18

statute of limitations.

19

And the surface owner does not interpose the

MR. CARROLL:

There is no statute of limitations

20 that applies to these —
21

QUESTION:

That's what I'm trying to get.

22 surface owner automatically prevails?

Is that it?

The
This is

23

not — statute of limitations are ordinarily a matter of

24

defense, aren't they?

25

MR. CARROLL;

Following notice.

That's correct.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 If he defaults following notice -- and we don't have any
2 quarrel with the statute if there was a notice provision
3 involved with the statute.
4

QUESTION*

It is the lack of --

That’s unusual, as my Brother Rehnquist

5 suggests, isn't it?
6

SR. CARROLL*

No, I don't think so.

In the first

7 place, this statute is very unique.
8

QUESTION*

Can you suggest any statutes of

9 limitations that have notice provisions?
10

MR. CARROLL*

Any statute of limitations -- for

11 example, if a statute of limitations were passed saying that
12 all actions for personal injury must be filed within one
13 year, let's say.

And prior to that it had been two years.

14 And that would apply to existing causes of action.

That

15 would be an unconstitutional taking of that interest,
16 because you cannot, by the statute of limitations, eliminate
17 the interest.
18

That would be —

QUESTION:

Well, a statute of limitations doesn't

19 really eliminate the interest.

It eliminates the

20 enforcement of the interest.
21

MR. CARROLL*

That's correct.

And the Supreme

22 Court of the state of Indiana specifically in this case has
23 said that this statute eliminates the right.
24

QUESTION:

The right —

25

MR. CARROLL*

The underlying right or rights.

2

MB. CARROLL:

3 rights.

The right to enforce?
And I'm talking about all of the

There are no rights left after this statute has

4 done its job that it sets out -5

QUESTION:

But this effects a defeasance of the

6 title, then, doesn't it?
7

SR. CARROLL:

It results in what the statute calls

8 an extinguishment of title.
9

QUESTION:

Right, and the transfer of the title to

10 someone else.
11

SR. CARROLL:

Yes, and that's the point because it

12 isn't an extinguishment of title, the title doesn't go away,
13 the interest in the minerals don’t go away.

They are

fflk

14 transferred by virtue of the act from one party to another,
15 as part of the stated purpose of the act.
16

Now, we think that if the stated purpose of the

17 act is to extinguish -18

QUESTION:

So for that reason you say this is not

19 really a statute of limitations —

MR. CARROLL:

QUESTION:

22

MR. CARROLL:

23

QUESTION:

He do not say it's at all --

It goes way beyond that.
It goes far beyond that.

Well Congress, shortly after the second

24 World War after this Court had made its portal-to-portal pay
25 ruling retroactively made them inapplicable, did it not, and

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that statute was never struck, down.
2

SR. CARROLL:

I don’t think it was — was it ruled

3 on by this Court?
4

QUESTION:

Second Circuit.

5

HR. CARROLL:

But not on a constitutional issue

6 that had been brought before this Court, so I’m not able to
7 answer that particular question, Justice Rehnquist.
8

QUESTION:

What would happen if the state changed

9 its adverse possession law from 20 to 10 years?
10

MR. CARROLL:

If the state changed its -- you see,

11 the problem is that there was no adverse possession law
12 possible in mineral interests in the state of Indiana prior

"'IU'

13 to this act.

There's probably none today.

14

QUESTION:

I assumed my question was hypothetical.

15

MR. CARROLL:

If the state would change its

16 adverse possession law and attempt to do it retroactively
17 and say that all things in which there had been adverse
18 possession for 10 years and 20 years, if the effect of that
19 act was to, as of the time of its passage, eliminate titles,
20 then I submit to the Court that that would be an improper
21 act and would violate the Constitution.
22

QUESTION:

I assume that it would be any state's

23 adverse possession law — I don’t understand all these
24 qualifications you’re putting in.

It just says the same law

25 that required 20 now requires 10, period.

Nothing else.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 What's wrong with it?
2

MR. CARROLLi

If that ten years has already run,

3 and prior to that it was 20 years, then I think there are
4 cases that clearly say that that’s an unconstitutional
5 taking;

that you cannot change a statute of limitations so

6 as to, by the very passage,

eliminate rights already

7 accruing.
8

QUESTION;

I didn’t know that adverse possession

9 was a statute of limitations.
10

MR. CARROLL;

It’s a different animal.

But it has a time limit built within

11 it.
12

QUESTION;

It certainly does.

13 can do it, don’t you?

Can change it?

And I think a state
Well, could the state

14 change it to 30?
15

MR. CARROLL;

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. CARROLL;

The state can indeed change --

But it can't change it to ten?
Yes, it can change it to ten.

The

18 question is can it do it retroactively.
19

QUESTION;

20

MR. CARROLL;

21 Marshall, is that

22

Is that retroactive?

I don't know.

The point I'm making, Mr. Justice

if they change it to ten and it had --

QUESTION;

Well, I'm trying to get at your point

23 about you have to give notice.

Because I'm waiting for that

24 case —
25

MR. CARROLL;

All I’m saying is the statute cannot

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 be used retroactively —
2

QUESTION;

I'd like to see that case about this

3 notice.
4

MR. CARROLL;

I’m not talking about notice; I’m

5 talking about the constitutionality of the statute on its
6 retroactive effect on the statute of limitations or adverse
7 possession.
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Carroll, this statute had no

9 retroactive effect, did it?

Supposing it -- it was passed

10 in 1971, was it?
11

MR. CARROLL;

12

QUESTION;

Yes, indeed.

Supposing everybody in the state got a

13 copy of the statute when it was passed, and everybody was
14 told, in effect, if you don’t pay any taxes on your mineral
15 interests in the next two years, they will no longer be your
16 property.
17

Would it be unconstitutional?
MR. CARROLL;

If everybody had notice of the act

18 in the manner that you prescribed, in my judgment it would
19 not be unconstitutional.
20

QUESTION;

Don’t we normally presume that the

21 citizens have notice of the statutes that are passed?
22

MR. CARROLL:

And I understand the general

23 principle of jurisprudence about how everybody is presumed
24 to know the law, how ignorance to the law is no excuse —
25

QUESTION;

Your case rests on the assumption that

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that’s an unrealistic presumption?
2

SR. CARROLL:

The case rests on the fact that

3 that’s a legal fiction.
4

QUESTION:

Well, a lot of people know the law,

5 particularly if they invest in mineral rights and if they
6 generally follow what goes -7

MR. CARROLL:

That’s true, but if you're trying to

8 deal with a due process issue, and if you're trying to deal
9 with a property which is about to be extinguished -10

QUESTION:

Well, you've got two years at the time

11 the statute was passed.
12

MR. CARROLL:

You have a two-year grace period,

13 which is meaningless 14

QUESTION:

Two years in which to perform a duty

15 you should be performing in any event.

You have a duty to

16 pay taxes, I assume.
17

MR. CARROLL:

That's correct.

And if you have

18 notice of that duty, we have no quarrel with this statute.
19

QUESTION:

Well, assume it's a state that says

20 publication is notice.
21

MR. CARROLL:

That's right.

That's exactly what

22 the Minnesota case was —
23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CARROLL:

25 constitutional.

Would that be okay?
What the Minnesota case said was not

In Indiana, the very act we’re dealing with

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 here, the manner of notice by publication of the act is by
2 merely printing the act and putting it in the clerk's
3

offices of the various counties.

4

that there is.
Now, is that — the question that really,

5

6 believe,
7

is that notice sufficient to comport with the Mullane

9

procedural due process.

QUESTION:

Mr. Carroll, under Indiana law, may

mineral rights be taxed separately?

11

MB. CARROLL:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CARROLL:

14

They may indeed be taxes separately.

Are they taxed?
Not very regularly.

In some

counties yes, in other counties no.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CARROLL:

17

QUESTION:

18

I

is before this Court for decision as we see it is,

8 decision on

10

That's the only notice

Is it up to the county?
It is up to the county.

And if they are taxed by the county,

does the county send out notices of taxes due?

19

MR. CARROLL:

20

QUESTION:

It does.

Were any notices received in these

21 cases?

MR. CARROLL:

22
23
24
25

No, sir, these were not taxed by the

county.
QUESTION :

None of the property involved in this

case involved —

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. CARROLLi

No, because an exception within the

2 use rule relates to the payment of taxes, but they were not
3 taxed.
4

And along that same line, Justice Powell, if it

5 were

taxed, and in order to transfer a title because of

6 non-payment of tax there is still a notice requirement,

QUESTION;

7
8

Yes, I understand that, I'm familiar

with the Virginia statute in that respect.

9 have

—

But that would

put you on notice that you'd received a tax assessment.

10

MR. CARROLL;

11

QUESTION;

12 Indiana

Yes.

And if you knew some counties in

were taxing mineral rights, would that have

13 suggested the desirability of making inquiry?

MR. CARROLL;

14

15 of mineral interest
16 Indiana
17 taxed in

is one way to solve the problem that

feels that it has.

If these mineral interests were

the way in which other real properties were taxed,

18 and if they
19 tax

Well, I think the matter of taxation

didnt' pay the tax the property could be sold at

sale like any other property, and that’s perfectly

20 legitimate,

there’s no problem with that.

21 constitutional about that.

But under Indiana law, as in

22 Virginia law and most other state law,
23 property at

when you sell

tax sale, the man is entitled to notice that his

24 property is about to be sold at
25 redeem.

Nothing

tax sale, with the right to

And there wasn’t any such notice here and there

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 wasn’t any such right to redeem following the two-year grace
2 period.
3

So I think it's distinctly different from the way

4 in which taxes can be treated, but taxation is the way to
5 deal with these old dormant mineral interests, because if
6 the people are interested in them, they will pay the tax,
7 they will keep it up.

If they're not interested in them,

8 they avoid the tax, it is sold at tax sale and the problem
9 is solved.
10

QUESTION

Well, they may be a more desirable way

11 to deal with it, but don’t you have to convince us that the
12 way Indiana has chosen to deal with it violates the federal
13 Constitution of the United States?
14

ME. CAEROLL*

Yes, and I would like the

15 opportunity, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, to do that by showing to
16 you that here, by virtue of the act, just looking at what
17 effect the act had, it did indeed have the effect of taking
18 what prior to the act was a fee simple mineral interest
19 entitled under the Indiana state cases to the firmest
20 protection of the Constitution.

Two years later, after the

21 passage of that act for those that did not know that they
22 had an obligation to record , they were left with nothing
23 unless they happened to have ten or more interests, in which
24 they event they had a right to protect themselves by notice
25 under certain circumstances if they otherwise qualified.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

So —

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Carroll, how does that differ

3 really in terms of procedure from other marketable title
4 statutes or recording acts or adverse possession laws?
5

I

just don't think that I perceive the procedural differences.
MR. CARROLL:

6

Justice O'Connor, the difference

7

between this and the Marketable Titles Act, for example, is

8

that the purpose of the Marketable Titles Act is to clear up

9 appendages to titles that go back, in the case of Indiana,
10

50 years.

And there, you must have a 50-year chain of clear

11

title.

12

years chain of clear title, then the law under the

13

Marketable Titles Act says we will confirm what you've

14

always claimed in that 50 years to have.

At the end of that 50-year period if you had 50

The man in possession gets no more than what he

15
16

has, in fact, claimed for the last 50 years.

In one sense,

17

marketable title acts are like adverse possession on the

18

record.

19

for 50 years.

On the record you've been claiming these interests
If you do so and the record is clear, at the

20 end of that time, the law says, we're going to get rid of
21

those old claims and you have a perfected title.

22

On the dormant mineral interest statute, however

23

-- in this case, for example, Mrs. Short who acquired this

24

property in 1974 had her property deed to her specifically

25

setting forth these mineral interests.

Now, that would not

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 qualify for marketable title because she didn't have a

chain

2 going back 50 years back to reminuence of title that didn't

3 show these interests.
4

So what Mrs. Short ends up by virtue of this

5 statute in having a title in more than she acquired when she
6 purchased the property.

In marketable titles you only get

7 what you've been claiming and no more.

So here, what you've

8 done is to enhance the title that the man had and you do it

9 within a two-year period.
10 distinction

And I think that's a basic

between marketable titles and the effect of this

11 act.
12

Again, though, if — I want to recur back to the

13 purpose of the Indiana Legislature in passing the act,
14 because throughout the briefs and the —
15

QUESTION:

I know you want to be concerned with

16 the purpose, but as I understand your brief, you're
17 objecting to the procedure, and I don't see how the
18 difference in purpose is significant if it's the procedural
19 due process that you're concerned with.
20

NR. CARROLL:

Right.

First, we say that the

21 passage of the act itself is not a due process notice that

22 in any way satisfies the Mullane test.

23

QUESTION:

So would it be your position that the

24 Marketable Titles Act and the Adverse Possession Act
25 nationwide would be defective on the same ground?

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. CARROLL;

Not at all.

2 passed on the Marketable Titles Act.

This court now has not
Wisconsin, or

3 Minnesota has passed on the Marketable Titles Act
4 constitutionally and found them to be constitutional,
5 whereas, they have found this act to be unconstitutional and
6 have distinguished between the two acts and found them to be
7 basically different.
8

And the procedural due process question goes to

9 the issue of what the state is attempting to achieve.
10 Marketable Titles has a benign purpose in terms of
11 protecting old titles.

This has a stated state policy of

12 extinguishing these interests.
13

QUESTION;

I don’t understand your distinction

14 that procedural due process depends on whether the state had
15 a benign purpose or a non-benign purpose.

I thought it was

16 simply procedural due process meant a matter of adequate
17 notice, regardless of the state's purpose.
18

MR. CARROLL;

And I think that’s true, you’re

19 correct in that statement. Justice Rehnquist.

From that

20 standpoint, except that it explains why there wasn't any
21 notice provision in this statute that you would normally
22 expect to find when you're going to extinguish rights.
23

For example, if a taxing statute was passed saying

24 that if you don’t pay your taxes when they are due on the
25 date they are due, there's an automatic forfeiture of rights

18

1 under that taxing statute.

Now, in terms of expectations of

2 people owning property, that goes beyond any expectation of
3 the property owner.
4

So also here, in terms of the expectation of a fee

5 simple title holder, he has no reason to believe that in a
6 two-year period for failure to register that his failure to
7 do so is going to extinguish his property right.
8

QUESTION:

Do you think a change in the ra te of

9 the Internal Revenue Code requires a notice to be sent to
10 each taxpayer?
11

HR. CARROLL:

No, indeed, I do not.

I think, here,

12 however, where you’re talking about extinguishment and
13 you’re talking about adoption of an act, and you give no
14 notice other than the adoption of the act, and we all
15 recognize that the adoption of the act is not, in fact,
16 notice.

You see, the act has to premise itself on a theory

17 of abandonment.
18

An abandonment is generally intended to be an

19 intentional act.
20

And if we get notice --

QUESTION:

Wait a minute, counsel.

An abandonment

21 is generally intended to be an intentional act?
22

MR. CARROLL:

23 Mr. Chief Justice.

As it relates to real estate, yes,

But you cannot abandon real estate in

24 most of the states — California I think has an exception to
25 that.

In most of the states and certainly in the state of

QUESTIONS

You can't do it by negligence and

3 confusion and lapse of memory.

Is that what you're telling

4 us, in most states?
5

NR. CARROLL;

If your title is of record and the

6 fact that you let the weeds grow —
7

QUESTION;

And adverse possessors.

8

HR. CARROLL;

That, of course, is a different

9 issue if there is an adverse possessor.

But we're talking

10 about abandonment which is independent of anybody else
11 coming in on top of your property.
12

They're proceeding on an abandonment theory here,

13 the theory is that if they didn't record their interest in
14 the two-year period they intended not to be bothered with
15 it, or they weren't around to protect it.

The evidence in

16 this case indicates that the appellants here were living in
17 the area or known in each instance when there was a 60-day
18 notice provision given under the statute, and within that
19 60-day period in each instance, the appellants in this case
20 did respond, did put their interest of record in the case of
21 Short v. Texaco and did contact the surface owner in the
22 Fond v. Walden case, which resulted in an agreed case to be
23 filed testing the act.

But all of that was after the time

24 that the two years had expired, beyond the time of the act.
25

But the point is that there was no intent to

2

MR. CARROLLi

3

QUESTION:

That may very well be the answer.

Because if it’s such a petty amount,

4 then there's kind of an administrative explanation for not
5 spending more money on notice and foreclosure and all the
6 rest in order to collect 35£ in tax.
7

HR. CARROLL:

But taxation, as is true in

8 Minnesota, is the way — what they have done in Minnesota -9 it was held unconstitutional in Contos again because of the
10 lack of notice, and it's a very similar statute to here, and
11 there they even had publication of notice statewide and in
12 the counties.
13

Here we have no notice.

Contos in Minnesota had notice by publication.

14 They said that doesn't comply with Mullane; that you must
15 have the best possible or practical notice that is available
16 to be given.

But in the Minnesota case in statute, he went

17 on to say that in effect, if you give the notice and if you
18 register the interest, then it's there to be taxed.
19 they set forth a special mineral interest tax.

And

And if you

20 don't pay the tax, you’re going to lose the interest.

And

21 that is a perfectly consitutional way to solve this problem.
22

But to say that you've got a right to come in and

23 give a two-year grace period and give no one notice of that
24 two-year grace period that's going to severely impact on his
25 property.

Now, and we get down to practicalities, I'm sure,

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 if what we’re talking about what the imposition of a tax,
2 and it's a matter of a few dollars, then I don't think that
3 the notice is going to be required.

But where the remedy is

4 extinguishment -- and I guess that really goes to the heart
5 of what we’re saying — where the remedy is extinguishment
6 within a two-year period, then justice and fair play would
7 insist that there be notice before that extinguishment take
8 place.

Otherwise, we do not think that there has been fair

9 play and that there has been compliance with the procedural
10 due process —
11

QUESTION:

Your time is running now.

Are you

12 going to address the taking question?
13

MB. CARROLL:

Yes.

I would like to just address

14 the taking question by making reference to the Mahon case
15 which this Court in most of the — not most of your
16 decisions — in many of the decisions in recent years has
17 reaffirmed the reasoning in the Mahon case and the decision
18 of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Mahon case.

In that instance,

19 there was declared a taking because they could not take out
20 all the subsurface coal, they would not let them allow
21 subsidance.

They didn’t take all of the rights; they took

22 part of the rights, and yet they said there was a taking,
23 even though the benefit of the taking accrued to the surface
24 owner.
25

And that’s what accrues here.

The taking, they

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 argue/ is not a taking because the benefit goes to the
2 surface owner.

And yet Mahon is directly in point on the

3 issue that you can still have a taking, even if the benefit
4 is to the surface owner.
5

So we think that the Mahon case and the later

6 cases clearly show a taking assuming that there is no valid
7 notice that would be required under procedural due process.
8 These two are so intertwined that the taking occurs and it
9 occurs primarily because the failure to have a procedural
10 due process requirement.
11

QUESTION:

Suppose a state passes a statute and

12 says that the state hereby acquires an easement over a
13 certain described part of the state and specifically
14 described the property, and that this easement will not be
15 paid for unless somebody -- unless everybody who should know
16 about this law comes in and asks for it within two years.
17

MR. CARROLL:

I think there's an apt analogy,

18 Justice Shite, to what we're talking about here.

Where

19 you're dealing with specific property and you're going to
20 put either a burden on that property of the kind we're
21 talking about, then I am suggesting that notice is a
22 prerequisite before the law enforces -23

QUESTION:

Sell, are you saying also that it's a

24 taking even if there’s notice?
25

MR. CARROLL:

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Partenheimer?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VERN P. PARTENHEIMER, JR., ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

9

MR. PARTENHEIMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court, I'd like to commence by attempting to
11 clarify for Justice Stevens what I believe is probably the
12 situation concerning severed mineral taxation in both
13 Indiana and, insofar as I know,

the state of Illinois, which

14 is about the limits of my general knowledge about this
15 subject.
16

The policy seems to be that if the interest is

17 being developed or is in use, then it is subject to a form
18 of local ad valorem taxation.

Also, if it is owned by a

19 coal company or some operative organization which is in the
20 process of producing coal, then generally that interest is
21 placed on the tax rolls and assessed for taxation.
22 Otherwise, interests in the hands of individuals are
23 generally considered perhaps not very valuable and that it's
24 not administratively very remunerative to impose taxes.
25

QUESTION;

It is real property and not personal

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 property in these states, isn’t it?
2

ME. PAP.TENHEIMEPi

In these states it's real

3 property in both instances, yes, sir.
4

The Indiana Dormant Mineral Act we submit is

5 essentially a recording act.

The General Assembly

6 determined that because of the elusive character of severed
7 minerals, these types of interest required a re-recording
8 periodically for the maintenance of the public records.

It

9 also acts as a statute of limitations with respect to claims
10 which remain, for whatever reason, unrecorded for a long
11 period of time.
12

The type of severances most affected by this act

13 are severances of coal, oil, gas or any or all of them,
14 either by a mineral deed or by a reservation in a general
15 warranty deed, and these severances generally are perpetual
16 on their face.
17

Unfortunately,

the record in this case comes to

18 the Court without any factual background concerning why the
19 statute may have been enacted or why it was necessary.

And

20 if you will, I'm going to ask the Court to permit me to
21 indulge in a few assumptions which I believe are reasonable
22 and would form the basis of this statute in the mind of a
23 legislator dealing with it.
24

First of all, my home county, Gibson County, has a

25 total area of about 320,000 acres, or approximately 500

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sections.

There’s not one section in that county that has

2 not been drilled for oil, and approximately 40% of the
3 county has been involved in coal development at one time or
4 another.
5

QUESTION:

This is southwestern Indiana?

6

ME. PARTENKEIMER:

7 Indiana.

There are approximately seven mineral-producing

Yes, sir, southwestern

8 counties in southwestern Indiana, and the rest of the state
9 is essentially non-mineral producing.
10

This oil and gas and coal development has occurred

11 in really three phases for oil and perhaps two phases for
12 coal, and it’s been over a period of about three
13 generations.

Determining the ownership of land and

14 interests in land from the public records, as I'm sure some
15 of you are aware, is a difficult, time-consuming and very
16 expensive job.
17

In my county, I have concluded from my own

18 estimates that probably 15% or 48,000 acres may be affected
19 by severed mineral claims.

And if I project this throughout

20 the state, I’m of the opinion at least that probably 336,000
21 acres or 1% of the entire state is affected by these types
22 of severed mineral claims.

So that it is, you can see, a

23 rather localized problem.
24

In my opinion, the total number of claimants; that

25 is, persons, affected by this act throughout the state may

27
AL.DERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 be as many as 40,000, and perhaps 10,000 have had their
2 rights extinguished under the act through their own failure
3 to comply.

So I hope that this gives you an idea at least

4 of what I consider to be the size of the problem.
5

For the most part, these claims have been treated

6 as valueless until they've been developed.

They've not been

7 assessed for taxes and estates have been settled in which
8 they have not been accounted for, they are not referred to
9 in the preparation of persons' wills.

So that after a

10 generation or two or three, we have a situation in which the
11 interests become very intricately fractionalized and very
12 difficult to track down as a matter of public record.
13

So this is the situation in which the General

14 Assembly sought to construct a legislative remedy.

That

15 remedy, needless to say, had to be effective and efficient
16 and should not have been unduly harsh.
17 Legislature has done that.

We think that the

It may not be the proper answer

18 for all states, but we think it's a proper answer for
19 Indiana.
20

The mineral claimants have relied on the

21 Pennsylvania Coal Company case, stating that the act effects
22 a taking without compensation.

We think that the act has

23 provided a means whereby any claimant can preserve his
24 interest.

It*s a simple and inexpensive means; he can

25 simply file once each 20 years periodically, and he loses

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 nothing if he complies with
2
3 has

If you will, in the words of this Court, the act

4 that is,
5 in

the act.

the single right to hold that interest perpetually

the future without a corresponding duty or obligation to

6 periodically keep the

public records up to date by making a

7 re-recording.

We think that the act in this regard and this case

8

9 are similar, for example,
10 believe

to the Eagle-Belick case, where I

it was Mr. Justice Brennan who suggested that the

11 appellants in that case

were attempting to compel the

12 government to regulate by
13 falls in

purchase.

We think this case

that category so far as the taking question is

14 concerned.
15

QUESTION!

Would you say that the case would be

16 any different if the provision was that

QUESTION:

So your short answer is yes, it would

4 be the same case on the taking.

MB. PARTENHEIMER:

Well, I think when you

6 interpose a taking by the state where the state itself
7 obtains some proprietary interest, then I think there is a
8 difference.
9
10

QUESTION:

Why?

MR. PARTENHEIMER:

Why?
Well, then you get into the

11 issue of a taking by the state for the purposes of the
12 state.
13

I'm reluctant to push that very far -QUESTION:

You could say that there should be —

14 it's less likely that there'd be a taking then because here,
15 to the extent there's a taking it's a taking for private
16 use.

It's taking a fee interest in the one piece of

17 property owned by X and giving it to Y.

19 it is an extinguishment for purposes of -20

QUESTION:

As long as I've got you interrupted,

24 what if this act not only applied to mineral interests, but
25 to all real property; any real property owner that didn't

2

MR. PARTENHEIMERi

Well, I think that there are

3 recording acts in various circumstances where there is a
4 justifiable public need, which do just that.
5

QUESTION:

Well, this — I'll just pose a case

6 where the record is perfectly clear as to who owns the
7 property, there's no doubt about it whatsoever.

The taxes

8 are paid; the person just happens to live out of the state
9 and never heard of the law, and doesn't file.

Do you think

10 the state can take his property that way?
11

MR. PARTENHEIMERi

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. PARTENHEIMERi

I think the —

Without notice?
I think that if there is an

14 overriding public policy, the state certainly can, and there
15 are instances in which the state has done just that.
16

QUESTION;

You mean without paying him for it at

17 all?
18

MR. PARTENHEIMERi

Well, I grant you the case you

19 put seems rather harsh, and I suppose it’s difficult to
20 disagree with you, but on the other hand, we do have a
21 situation here in which there is notice of the law in which
22 a simple remedy was provided.
23

QUESTION:

Well, notice of the law, but the fact

24 is you say these dormant interests have become very
25 splintered because they go through various estates and there

I think that

just that;

20 whether or not the incorporation of a traditional grace
21 period in this type of law is still a constitutionally

22 acceptable method of making the law work retroactively.
23

In connection with that central issue, I would

24 like to discuss the early dormant bank account cases.
25 of them

have been cited, Security Bank v. California,

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Three

1 Anderson National Bank v. Luckett and Standard Oil v. New
2 Jersey.
3

In the Security Bank and Standard Oil cases, the

4 act provided for an adjudication, a final adjudication of
5 abandonment of these bank accounts, and at the same time
6 provided for a — more or less simultaneously provided for
7 -- a seizure of the bank accounts.

The court in these two

8 cases was dealing with not the depositor himself, but with
9 the bank who naturally wanted to keep the windfall, wanted
10 to appropriate the windfall for itself rather than turn it
11 over to the state, and was arguing that it would be placed
12 in double jeopardy if it had to give up the deposit without
13 some kind of good notice to the depositor.
14

The court held that a simple newspaper publication

15 was adequate for a notice to the depositor, so far as
16 protection to the bank from double jeopardy was concerned
17 because it was an In Rem proceeding.

And I believe,

18 certainly in the Security Bank case and I believe also in
19 the Standard Oil case,

the court did not decide any issues

20 of constitutionality between the depositor himself and the
21 state.
22

I think those cases were cases wherein

23 adjudication was provided for, a court adjudication, and the
24 court simply held that notice by publication was sufficient.
25

The Luckett case was a bit different.

In that

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 case, the portion of the act which was appealed from only
2 involved a transfer of custody of the deposit from the bank
3 to the state through an administrative proceeding by the
4 Attorney General.

In that case, the holding of the court

5 especially indicated that all of us, or all persons who
6 deposit money in banks in the state make those deposits with
7 notice of the conditions which the state imposes by law upon
8 those deposits, and that we must be presumed to have notice
9 that under certain circumstances the surrender of our bank
10 accounts to the state may be compelled.
11

The court went on to hold that so far as the

12 seizure of the property itself was concerned, the in rem
13 matter, that the posting of a notice on the courthouse door
14 was a sufficient form of notice to give to provide
15 administrative jurisdiction to the seizure.
16

QUESTION*

Hr. Partenheimer, is my recollection

17 correct that at least in the New Jersey case — I think I
18 know something about that statute — there was a period of
19 years after the seizure when the depositor was able to begin
20 a proceeding and get his money back.
21

HE. PARTENHEIHER:

HR. PARTENHEIMER;

1 Indiana statute, is there?
2

MS. PARTENHEIMER;

No, but this Indiana statute

3 does not provide for an adjudication, either.

The thought

4 that you have is the fact that in the New Jersey case the
5 statute provided a final adjudication, but then said that
6 anyone who, because of lack, of privy or lack of notice, was
7 not bound by that adjudication had a five-year statute of
8 limitation in which to sort of come in and reopen the matter.
9

QUESTION:

But that does not happen in Indiana as

10 to these mineral rights, does it?
11

SR. PARTENHEIMER;

No, it dees not because the

12 statute itself provides for no adjudication at all.

There

13 is no proceeding at all involved.
14

QUESTION:

That period allowed is something like

15 the redemption period after the foreclosure of a mortgage or
16 a trust, is it not?
17

MR. PARTENHEIMER;

In the case Justice Brennan

18 put , I would agree, yes.
19

While we’re on that subject I would simply argue

20 to the Court that not one of those cases, nor any other
21 case, has ever held that an administrative or judicial
22 proceeding is a necessary element of due process in a law
23 affecting property rights.
24

In this case the appellants argue for notice of

25 extinguishment of their rights.

Well certainly, notice

1 would be of no value to them unless they had the opportunity

Title

3 puritive legislation characteristically has not done this.
4 It relies on independent remedies such as ejectment and
5 quiet title proceedings, and we think there are some
6 practical reasons for that and I’d like to mention just two
7 or three .
8

First, there is a great difficulty in identifying

9 and locating who are the persons who would be -- to whom the
10 act would be applicable.

We can't send a copy of the

11 general laws to every citizen, and if we did that still
12 wouldn't provide him with any realistic notice of anything.
13

Secondly, if these people could be identified and

14 located, who has the motivation to do it?
15 state.

The state has no obligation.

16 owner of the servient interest.

Certainly not the

Certainly not the

Why would that person who

17 had the estate which was subservient, why would he be
18 interested in providing notice to someone who was away and
19 who had left his property and advise him that he should come
20 back and do something to preserve it and take advantage of
21 it.

There simply is no logic that a statute of that type

22 would work.
23

And finally,

the public policy is as well served

24 by the extinguishment of the right as by any other result.
25

Therefore, we think that there have been good

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reasons for

2 enacted,

the simple use of grace periods,

The statute is

a grace period is allowed, and people are presumed

3 after a certain period of time to have had sufficient
4 interest in a property to care for it.

This philosophy and

5 reasoning of course has been annunciated many times.
6 Personally,

I like the view by Justice McKenna in a

7 relatively old case, Ballard v. Hunter, that's 204 US at
8 262,

and if I may, I'm going to quote just a little bit of

9 his philosophy concerning this matter.
He says, "The law cannot give personal notice of

10

11 its provisions or proceedings to everyone.
12 or may concern their real estate,

13 informed.

Of what concerns

men usually keep

And on that probability the law may frame its

14 proceedings.

Indeed, must frame them and assume the care of

15 proper to be universal if it would give efficiency to many
16 of its exercises."
17

I have two further points that I would like to

18 make.

I won't argue the contract impairment theory because

19 the opponent does not argue it and we simply feel that it is
20 a

slight regulatory impairment, and the same reasoning

21 applies

22

as applies with regard to the taking issue.
The remaining matter that I'd like to discuss just

23 briefly is equal protection.
24 appellants’

In the briefs, we think the

equal protection arguments are strained if not a

25 little misleading.

The Section 5 of the act has not one but

We think the legislature could have concluded that

15 one holding

ten or more interests might have a significantly

16 higher risk of inadvertently losing one or more than one
17 through

a mis-filing or an error in filing, a clerical

of some kind.

that such an error might bring on a

QUESTION:

Do you know of any case that says that

process and equal protection is measured by how much

25 money is involved?

The extent of the --

QUESTION;

I don't think any protection has ever been

7 apply to the poor.

That's drawing the line on people who

8 have got money, isn't it?
9

MR. PARTENHEIKER;

Yes, sir, that would be.

I

10 agree with you on the equal protection question as such.

I

11 don't know that the due process standard is always the same,
12 depending upon the quality or quantity of the interest
13 involved .

QUESTION:

Mr. Partenheimer, may I ask, what was

15 your answer to your colleague's reliance on Mahon on the
16 taking question?
17

MR. PARTENHEIMER:

I think, Your Honor, that the

18 fact that there is a means provided that is simple and
19 expedient by a simple re-recording or re-filing to preserve

QUESTION:

Something not present under the

MR. PARTENHEIMER:

Oh, no.

25 irretrievably.

1

I have one final point to make, and that is that

2 the appellants and the trial court in this case tended to
3 focus on the issue of who was a known owner and who might he
4 an unknown owner, and to try to distinguish between those.
5 In the situation as we perceive it, the question of who is
»

6 an unknown owner and who is a known owner can only be
7 determined by some kind of an objective standard.

Everyone

8 is unknown until he either makes himself known or until
9 someone hunts him down and makes him known.
10

He think that the statute has provided an

11 objective standard to determine who is going to be treated
12 as known and who is going to be treated as unknown.

Those

13 persons who have used their interest or who have filed will
14 be considered known.

Those persons who have not, will be

15 considered as unknown.
16

And accordingly, we think that this objective

17 standard, together with the filing alternative and the
18 incorporation of the grace period to cover the retroactive
19 situation entitles this law to be treated as a
20 constitutional exercise of the regulatory power of the
21 state, and that the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court on
22 this issue should be affirmed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. CARROLL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. CARROLL;

Two more comments, if I may.

One is

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 we somehow have put this case based upon expediency/ and I
2 don't think, we're going to make — should not make
3 constitutional judgments about what is expedient on the
4 matter of whether we're going to give notice.
5

Counsel has said that the act is going to

6 determine who is known and who is unknown as an owner.

I

7 submit that Section 6 of the act is an answer to the
8 questions which are raised, because it will clarify and
9 protect your recording statute, which he says this is; it
10 will put on the record those that are known or unknown; and
11 if you read Section 6, it is a perfect answer to procedural
12 due process.
13

The only problem with Section 6 is it only applies

14 if you have ten or more interests.

Had it applied to all of

15 the interests, we would not be here today.

This is a

16 statute which, by its nature, does not treat people who have
17 less than ten interests fairly.
18 terminate their interest.

It was designed to

But if you look at Section 6 you

19 have a perfect answer to how it should have been done on a
20 constitutional basis and protect everybody, be they rich,
21 the poor, the large, the small owner, put the interests of
22 record.

Because if they don’t come forward after the

23 notice, then you can assume the surface owner is the owner.
24 If they do come forward, then they have their interest of
25 record.

The statute does not do that, and it does not do
