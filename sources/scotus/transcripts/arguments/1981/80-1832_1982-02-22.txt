CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gressman, you may

proceed when you are ready.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE GRESSMAN, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

7

MR. GRESSMAN:

Chief Justice Burger, and may

8

it please the Court, this is something of an historic

9

occasion.

Never before have the two Houses of Congress

10

been forced to intervene as litigating parties before

11

this Court.

12

protest another episode in the -- what this Court once

13

described as the tug of war between the executive and

14

the legislative branches of government.

They have been forced to intervene to

The House of Representatives, which I

15
16

represent here, views this attack upon the legislative

17

powers of Congress as directed primarily at the

18

historic, necessary, and proper power of the Congress to

19

enact legislation which it deems appropriate and

20

necessary in execution of its vested legislative powers.
I suggest that that is the proper place for

21
22

starting the constitutional analysis of the validity of

23

Section 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act

24

of 1952.

25

understand that, as I stated before, while the assault

But before we get to that analysis, we must

4

1

here comes upon that particular provision of the

2

Immigration and Nationality Act, this is but one episode

3

in the far-flung, orchestrated war declared by the

4

executive branch against the device that is popularly

5

and often inaccurately known as the legislative veto.
In case after case where private parties seek

6
7

to raise this constitutional attack upon the so-called

8

legislative veto, the executive branch immediately drops

9

all opposition and concedes that the veto provision is

10

indeed unconstitutional.

That has forced the two Houses

11

of Congress to become litigating parties, which is not

12

their basic function, but we have been forced by the

13

fact that there is no one in the executive department

14

that sees fit to defend or state the case for the

15

constitutionality of these provisions.
Now, that very fact, as in this case, gives

16
17

rise to a tremendous number of severe problems,

18

threshold problems about whether or not that is a case

19

or controversy, or whether there are other reasons why

20

such a momentous constitutional question should be

21

addressed under the circumstances in which this case

22

arises.

23

We have in this case alone critical problems

24

about the jurisdiction of the lower court to consider

25

this constitutional question.

We have problems of

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

justiciability.

We have problems about the standing of

2

Mr. Chadha to institute this kind of constitutional

3

challenge based not on his personal claims or rights but

4

upon the executive's claims with respect to the

5

legislative veto.
We have a severe problem with respect to the

6
7

lack of any adverse parties in the court below, and

8

there are other prudential considerations, to say

9

nothing of a critical severability problem which may

10

preclude resolving the constitutional question, a matter

11

which my colleague, the Senate legal counsel, will

12

add ress.

13

To take but one brief look at the technical

14

appeal problem that is before this Court in Number

15

80-1832, where the government has sought to take an

16

appeal to this Court under Section

17

non-aggrieved party.

18

1252 as a

I will not add anything to what has been said

19

in our written briefs on this subject, except to call

20

attention to the Court’s procuring of a ruling one month

21

ago, on January 11th, in Donovan against Richmond County

22

Association, which I suggest makes even more severe the

23

government’s problem in trying to take an appeal to this

24

Court under Section 1252.

25

But to get back to the other issues in this
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case, I suggest that the key to understanding all these

2

threshold problems as well as the basic constitutional

3

question, lies in an appreciation of the actual meaning

4

and scope of the statutory scheme issue, to wit. Section

5

244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

6

Now, the executive and Hr. Chadha would begin

7

and end their constitutional analysis by referring to

8

the two constitutional objections that are repeated over

9

and over again in all this litigation respecting the

10

so-called legislative veto.

11

upon the presentment clause, Article I, Section 7 of the

12

Constitution, which typifies the bicameral method of

13

legislating, subject to presentment to the President for

14

his approval or veto.

15

That is an objection based

The other claim, the only other constitutional

16

objection raised, again by Hr. Chadha as well as by the

17

executive, is that this provision somehow violates the

18

general separation of powers doctrine, not that it

19

violates any function vested expressly in the President

20

or the judiciary, but that it violates simply Baron de

21

Hontesquieu's original theory of separation of powers.

22

It seems to me, however, that that is turning

23

constitutional analysis upside down.

We must begin

24

analysis where this Court has always begun to evaluate

25

Congressional legislation, and that is, let’s see what

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Congress was actually doing, what power was it trying to

2

execute when it adopted this provision in the

3

Immigration and Nationality Act.

4

Basically, I rely upon the analysis that was

5

established by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch

6

versus Maryland in

7

hundreds of times by this Court in evaluating the

8

constitutionality of Congressional legislation, where

9

Congress is trying to exercise some of its given power.

1819, and has been followed literally

It is not difficult to state that standard

10
11

that Marshall laid down.

In the first part, he says,

12

let the end be legitimate.

13

constitutional scope of Congressional powers.

14

he said that all means which Congress considers

15

appropriate to a legitimate end are constitutional, and

16

this Court has said many times that that simply means

17

that there must be a rational connection between the

18

means and the end.

19

says that the means selected by the Congress in exercise

20

of its vast discretion under this necessary and proper

21

clause must be consistent with the letter and spirit of

22

the Constitution.

Let it be within the
Secondly,

And thirdly, the McCulloch opinion

Now, he also added another part to that last

23
24

step.

In order for any other provision in the

25

Constitution to inhibit or restrict the means selected

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

by the Congress, he says, at Page 408 of the McCulloch

2

opinion, that those other words of the Constitution must

3

imperiously require a restriction upon the means.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gressman, do you think

5

that cases like United States against Myers involving

6

the firing of a postmaster, and Buckley against Valeo,

7

involving the method of appointment to the Federal

8

Election Commission, violate McCulloch against Maryland?

9

MR. GRESSMAN:

Not at all, Your Honor.

It

10

seems to me that the appointments clause in Article II,

11

I think it is, imperiously inhibits any means selected

12

by Congress whereby Congress is trying to appoint an

13

officer of the United States.

14

consistent.

15

separation of powers doctrine.

16

somehow, if that is the objection, the doctrine must be

17

reduced to a specific imperious restriction, as it is

18

when you have some vested Presidential power that is

19

specified in Article II, where Congress seeks to invade

20

or utilize.

21
22
23
24
25

So it is entirely

I am not objecting to the use of the
I am merely saying that

I think that is a clear imperious restriction
upon Congressional power.
QUESTION:

Does United States against Lovett

have something to do with this, too?
MR. GRESSMAN:

No, I don’t believe the Lovett

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case had anything to do with the power of Congress

2

vis-a-vis the executive.
QUESTION:

3

Well# wasn't that an effort# at

4

least so Justice Black's opinion reached a conclusion

5

that Congress was undertaking to terminate the

6

employment of an executive branch officer without any

7

due process.
MP. GRESSMAN:

8
9

Yes# without any due process#

and it was considered to be a bill of attainder, which

10

was a right adhering to the private parties in those

11

cases.

12

attempting to execute some kind of power that was vested

13

in the President.

14

the bill of attainder clause.

15

That was — the Congress was not there

It was simply that Congress violated

Now, I say that that is another good example

16

of a provision in the Constitution which might

17

imperiously restrict the means selected in a given case.

18

QUESTION:

I take it you think the bill of

19

attainder is the only basis on which that result is

20

supportable in the Lovett case.

21

MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, as I read the majority

22

opinion and the briefs in that case# that was the main

23

and the only issue that became decisive in this Court's

24

opinion, and it was not conceived of as an

25

executive-legislative conflict.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, to guickly address the McCulloch analysis

2

to the provisions in Section 244,

I think it is without

3

any doubt that the end being sought in this legislation

4

was within the legitimate powers of the Congress under

5

the Constitution.

6

and Section 244 thereof are directed toward the

7

Congressional control over aliens and deportation, and

8

as this Court said as late as 1977 in Fiallo versus

9

Bell, in 430 U. S.,

The Immigration and Nationality Act

this Court has repeatedly emphasized

10

that over no conceivable subject is the legislative

11

power of Congress more complete than it is over the

12

admission of aliens.

13

Our cases have long recognized the power to

14

expell or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign

15

attribute exercised by the government's political

16

departments, largely immune from judicial control.

17

the end sought here, that is, the control over aliens,

18

is certainly a legitimate end.

19

So,

Secondly, let us look at the means selected by

20

the Congress to achieve that kind of control or end.

21

Was it appropriate?

22

again in our briefs to outline the meaning and the

23

significance of Section 244.

24

is by intention and by language a procedure for

25

petitioning the Congress of the United States to be

Well, we have attempted time and

Any way you look at it, it

attaining identical kind of relief through private bill

6

of those petitions or applications.

Section 244 also delegates to the Attorney

QUESTION;

Mr. Gressman, may I ask you, you

8

rely on the power to pass private naturalization bills,

9

I understand.

Are those bills consistent with the

10

constitutional requirement that naturalization bills

11

must be uniform?
MR. GRESSMAN;

12

Well,

I am not sure that those

13

are the types of legislation, private legislation I am

14

referring to.

15

private bill an alien to stay within this country, not

16

to be naturalized.

These are simply ones that permit by

MR. GRESSMAN;

19
20
21
22

Well, isn’t that -- Oh, I see.
It is a different operation,

but
QUESTION;

It has nothing to do, you suggest,

with naturalization?
MR. GRESSMAN;

No, not the kind of private

23

bill, nor does Section 244 have anything to do with

24

naturalization.

25

It merely is a --

10

Well, they are different, is

I think they are conceptually different.

bills, too?

6
7

I would think it is broader than

In any event, what you are saying

is -- of course, I guess the question isn't here -- that
the uniformity provision in any event does not apply.
MR. GRESSMAN:

11

No.

No.

Well, as I said, the

12

Attorney General is given a limited function, to wit, he

13

is given a certiorari-like weeding-out process, a

14

screening process whereby he weeds out the ineligible

15

and

16

is authorized to give temporary stays or suspensions of

17

deportation to those who he considers worthy of relief.

18

Then, he reports those to Congress for a final

19

consideration, and only after Congress considers this

20

under 244(c)(2) can the alien be excused from

21

deporta tion.

22
23

the unworthy applicants who seek this relief, and he

QUESTION:

Well, now, you couldn't do that in

the case of the judicial branch, could you?

24

MR. GRESSMAN:

25

QUESTION:

No.

Say that a court is given kind of

13

1

certiorari-like jurisdiction to make recommendations to

2

Congress.
ME. GRESSMAN;

3

Absolutely not, Your Honor, and
\

4

I think there is a vast difference in the

5

interrelationships between Article I and Article II as -QUESTION;

6

Does that suggest, Mr. Gressman,

7

that -- I gather the action of the Attorney General,

8

suppose he refuses to grant the suspension.

9

judicial review, isn’t it?

10

MR. GRESSMAN;

11

QUESTION;

That is

That is judicial review.

And suppose that it is reviewed,

12

and the court says, no, the Attorney General is wrong,

13

he should have granted the suspension.

14

MR. GRESSMAN;

15

QUESTION;

16

I don’t think --

May Congress then step in under the

statute and —
MR. GRESSMAN;

17

No.

I don’t think that — I

18

don't think the court has ever said that you must grant

19

a deportation.

20

Justice Brennan, and that is that if the Attorney

21

General grants this temporary relief, that is not

22

reviewable by the courts.

23

in that situation.
QUESTION;

24
25

But you raise a very interesting point,

There is no aggrieved party

No, that is not the case I put to

you .

1

MR. GRESSMAN;

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. GRESSMAN:

4

QUESTION;

5

It is where he refuses it.
That's right.

And the court says he should have

granted it.

6

MR. GRESSMAN;

7

QUESTION;

8

I know.

Well, I would think that --

Then my interest was whether or not

the Congress then could step in and pass a suspension.

9

MR. GRESSMAN;

No, I don't think that that is

10

likely to happen, and I don't know of any instance where

11

it ever followed through.

12

overturn, seek to overturn a judicial determination of

13

that nature.
QUESTION;

14

I don't think Congress would

Well,

I gather what was said in

15

Waterman rather indicates that Congress could not,

16

doesn't it?
MR. GRESSMAN;

17

I would think that might be the

18

case, yes.

But the point finally is that neither the

19

presentation -- the presentment clause nor the general

20

separation of powers doctrine can be said to be an

21

imperious restriction upon the choice of means selected

22

by Congress to execute its power over the naturalization

23

or deportation of aliens.

24

as was -- the Section 244, as this case -- as this Court

25

said in Jay versus Boyd, Section 244 really calls upon

The clause, in other words,

15

3

itself in exercise of its necessary and proper clause to

4

pardon, to excuse a lawful deportation requirement.
QUESTION*

5

It is just like

Congress is authorized

Well, except, Mr. Gressman, this

6

was an action of the Immigration Subcommittee, wasn't

7

it?

was the feeling of the Committee that Chadha did not

did not meet statutory requirements.

MR. GRESSMAN:

17

MR. GRESSMAN:

That is right.

Isn't that an adjudicatory act?
Not at all, Your Honor, any

18

more than when a prisoner seeks to get a pardon.

19

versus Boyd says --

20

QUESTION:

As Jay

I know, but what is involved, I

21

think, is, did Congress perform a legislative act in

22

that determination?

23

legislative action , can it?

24
25

Congress can't do other than

difference.
QUESTION;

to pardon?
NR. GRESSMAN:

That is an analogy drawn by

MR. GRESSMAN;

But you can't even

get close to verba, let alone in haec, as to the

MR. GRESSMAN;

1

All I can do is to repeat the

2

words of this Court in the Jay case, that an applicant

3

for suspension, like Mr. Chadha, comes to the INS and to

4

Congress not as a matter of right but as a matter of

5

grace.

sentence.

7

demanded as a right, and they footnote the analogy to

8

the Presidential pardon power.

9

It is like probation or suspension of criminal
It comes as an act of grace and cannot be

Well, I see my time has expired, but I will

10

only conclude by saying that as we have developed at

11

some length in the brief, the separation of powers

12

doctrine, the general separation doctrine simply does

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DAVIDSON, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
UNITED STATES SENATE

5

6

MR. DAVIDSON;

Chief Justice Burger, and may

7

it please the Court, between 1934 and 1940, the Congress

8

and the executive were at an impasse over the question

9

of relief from deportation.

The impasse had resulted

10

from the inability of those two branches to reconcile

11

the desire of the executive for discretionary authority

12

to waive mandatory deportation laws, and the prevalent

13

belief in the Congress that to grant such discretion

14

would be to advocate its responsibility over the

15

Immigration Act.

16

In 1940, the Congress and the executive

17

resolved their stalemate by agreeing to a compromise,

18

since amended into Section 244, by which they have since

19

cooperated in granting permanent residence to thousands

20

of deportable aliens.

21

there was a fundamental constitutional defect in that

22

accommodation, and that this Court should now revise the

23

legislative bargain to give to the executive the very

24

power which the Congress had refused to grant to it.

what would Congress have done if it had known that this

Among the diverse second choices rejected by

the Congress have been the following.

In 1937,

Representative Diaz proposed that the executive be

MR. DAVIDSON:

questions.

14

could take the introductory subsection of 244 and make

15

it into the entire section as a full and final grant to

is recognized in the briefs in this case, is that that

QUESTION:

What does the Court do with the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

severability clause that Congress itself enacted, then?
MR. DAVIDSON;

In the 1952 Act, there is a

3

severability clause which applies to the vastness of the

4

Immigration and Nationality Act, and quite certainly the

5

diverse provisions of that Act, which include quotas for

6

immigration, rules for naturalization, procedures of all

7

kinds, many of those provisions are severable from each

8

other, but here, in this one section, where the

9

statutory procedures refer quite explicitly, and in

10

which there is no way to grant the final relief sought

11

here unless Section 244(c)(2) is in its entirety an

12

effective provision, then the Court may not do what only

13

the Congress can do, which is to make the second choice,

14

what powers should exist if these powers are invalid.

15

I think this brings the Court to the second

16

question, and it is one that is briefed by both sides.

17

If it is impossible to sever this statute without being

18 unfaithful to the intent of the Congress, that the
19

judgment of the Attorney General is only a preliminary

20

judgment, and that legal effect may only be given with

21

the approval of the Congress, then the Court must

22

decide, is there any basis upon which it can give relief

23

to the alien respondent.

24
25

If the statute is inseverable, then the entire
system for discretionary relief falls, and the issue
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

goes back to the Congress to decide whether it should be

2

replaced at all, but if that is the case, then there is

3

no benefit that the particular individual who brought

4

this proceeding has to gain from the Court's judgment.
The Respondents argue nonetheless that the

5
6

Court should proceed to decide the issue, that the Court

7

has never decided a case in which there is no benefit to

8

be conferred either immediately or potentially on the

9

individual who invokes the Court’s jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

10

But you don't get to severability

11

until you first decide the constitutional question, do

12

you ?

13

NR. DAVIDSON:

This Court's ordinary approach

14

to statutory and constitutional matters is to determine

15

statutory issues first, in order --

16

QUESTION:

But that hasn't been true in cases

17

where we have been dealing with the constitutional

18

argument that a part of a statute is invalid.

19

20

you find that part of a statute is invalid.

MR. DAVIDSON:

There is

The ultimate question is of the

22

Court's role, and particularly of the Court's role in a

23

dispute between its coordinate branches.

granting relief, then it is within the Court's tradition

2

presented here.
QUESTION:

3

Is there any case you can cite for

4

that proposition, that you first take up severability

5

and then the constitutional issue?
MB. DAVIDSON:

6

There is a direct conflict

7

between the decision in this case and the decision of

8

the court of appeals for the Fourth Circuit, because

9

that court, in a legislative review case, decided

10

explicitly that it should reach the question of

11

severability.

12

non-severable, and that it should therefore not render

13

an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of the

14

statute .

15
16
17

It found that the statute was

QUESTION:

Any case from this Court that takes

up severability before constitutionality?
MR. DAVIDSON:

We have cited the Carter

18

Company coal case, in which the Court did not reach the

19

question of the constitutionality of wage -- of price

20

control provisions under the NIRRA, because it had

21

decided that those provisions fell on account of the

22

inseverability of the statute.

23

The only cases in which the Court has dealt

24

with both issues is when it was simply a matter of the

25

structuring of its opinions, but we have now a question

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the role of the Court.

2

this case not only implicates this statute, but

3

implicates a constellation of other relationships

4

between the executive and legislative branch, from war

5

powers to control of arms sales, budget, rulemaking

6

throughout the national government, that the Court not

7

depart from traditional rules of restraint and determine

8

whether a statutory question must be resolved in a way

9

which makes the constitutional issue unavoidable.
QUESTION;

10

It is very important, because

MR. DAVIDSON;

We don't think the Constitution

14

should be read as a contract in which those particular

methods of blending power are thought to be exclusive.

By bicameral agreement and presentation to four

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

14
15

Mr. Solicitor General.

ON BEHALF OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE
MR. LEE*

16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

17

the Court, any attempt to defend the constitutionality

18

of a legislative veto faces, I submit, an insoluble

19

dilemma.

20

constitutional demands that that device has to satisfy.

21

They are, first, the twin requirements for lawmaking

22

specified in Article I of the Constitution, passage by

23

both Houses of Congress and presentation to the

24

President, and the second is separation of powers.

25

The reason is that there are two separate

And now the dilemma.

Any attempt to explain a

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

legislative veto in such a way as to blunt the

2

separation of powers problems, that this is not really

3

enforcement of the law, or this is not really

4

interpretation of the law, only serves to highlight the

5

fact that whatever else may be involved, the Congress is

6

clearly exercising legislative power, making new law,

7

and is doing so by one House of Congress and without

8

participation by the President.

9

QUESTION;

Has there ever been a statute held

10

invalid by this Court beginning with the jurisdictional

11

statute that was involved in Marbury against Madison, in

12

which it could not be said that the statute had the

13

blessing of the two Houses and the President?

14

MR. LEE;

Not to my knowledge, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, and that is the most fundamental underpinning

16

of Article I and it is also the most fundamental

17

underpinning of the — of the Framers' intention.

18

there is one thing that is clear from the constitutional

19

history, it is, Number One, that they were concerned

20

above all, as this Court observed in Buckley versus

21

Valeo, about an overweaning Congress, and Number Two,

22

that the two protections that they built into the

23

Constitution against that very eventuality was, Number

24

One, bicamerality, if there is such a word, the

25

requirement of two Houses of Congress, and Number Two,

In an understandable attempt by the House and

3

Senate to focus this Court’s attention on the separation

of powers issue on that issue alone, and I will deal

5

with that in just a moment, the House and Senate

stressed the fact that this is legislation.

11

that this is — that it doesn’t matter what you call it,

12

There are certain instances in which the

than by legislating, such as proposal of constitutional

24

not even the best friends of the legislative veto

25

contend that that device falls into any one of those

All right.

So that aside from those

categories, the only way that Congress can act is by

legislation.

Congress lacks the constitutional power to do it.

if it is legislation, then the bicameralism and the

characterize it as either legislation or not

be complied with.

that both you and your friends have referred to this as

Mr. Lee, I think that the House and

particular legislation was in fact passed by both Houses

and presented to the President, and therefore met all

8

the requirements.

9

MR. LEE:

Would you address yourself to that?
That is a very easy question, or

10

very easy argument to answer, and it is simply that the

11

House and Senate by two-thirds vote at least, as I read

12

the Constitution as I came into Court this morning,

13

cannot amend the Constitution.

passed over President Truman's veto, but that is

immaterial.

16

together with the President nor the House and Senate by

clear requirements in Article I, Section 1 of the

Constitution that legislative power means -- that

20

legislative power means power that is to be exercised by

21

two Houses, and the requirement in Article I, Section 7,

22

that any exercise of legislative power must be presented

MR. LEEi

QUESTION:

6

Well, I won't —
Say, delegate to an administrative

agency the process of drafting regulation.
MR. LEE:

7

Yes, sir.

It then becomes execution

of the laws, in my view, Justice Stevens, and that, I

9

think, follows naturally from both this Court’s

10

decisions of a half-century ago and also even more so

11

QUESTION:

12

What if, in this statute, instead

13

of having a one-House veto they created a special

14

administrative review board, some special, unusual name

15

for it, of three persons appointed by the President, or

16

something like that, who would then make precisely the

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that if, as this Court held in Buckley versus Valeo,

Congress may not constitutionally appoint officers of

the United States, a fortiori, they may not perform the

executive function themselves by stepping in and in

Similarly, the Petitioners' arguments with

MR. LEE;

is a violation of separation of powers.

wouldn't be a very strong argument, and we are not

itself says in its brief. Congress has withheld from the

Davidson.

We have examined. Justice Rehnguist, the cases

24

it.

I do not know of any single case --

we found about

2

25 of them -- I do not know of any single case, and

3

certainly Carter versus Carter Coal is not one of them,

4

in which this Court has ever considered the issue of

5

severability prior to the issue on the merits.

6

Now, in fairness, I must say that there is

7

never any case in which the issue was exactly as Mr.

8

Davidson has argued, and I understand what his argument

9

is, but I will also say that I agree completely with the

10

proposition that there is simply no reason even to reach

11

the severability issue unless and until you first reach

12

the issue on the merits.
QUESTION»

13

Well,

supposing we reach the issue

14

on the merits, and decide it in your favor.

15

is your position on severability?
HR. LEE;

16

Then what

That it is not severable, for these

17

reasons.

Mr. Morrison will develop this in more detail,

18

because it pertains more to his client, but in the first

19

place, severability is merely an aspect of the more

20

general and the broader constitutional principle that

21

the function of the Court is to save rather than to

22

destroy.

23

in that respect, that the question is whether the

24

balance could stand if we took out this particular

25

provision, it can stand very, very well.

Now, using Mr. Davidson's own characterization

You take out 244(c)(2) and just put them out

The rest of it functions very nicely.

QUESTION;

Well, I should think that future

4

administrations might have some cause to regret you

5

analysis of severability when they go to Congress and

6

want legislation, because in effect Congress gives more

7

than it otherwise would have in return for the

8

legislative veto, and then the next day after signing it

9

the President sends his Attorney General to court to

10

challenge the legislative veto.

11

compromise is just washed out.

12

MR. LEE;

So in effect the

What that is saying is, of course,

13

exactly what my opponents -- this is a major theme in

14

their briefs, that there are some practical reasons that

15

the legislative veto has something to say for it, and my

16

answer, of course, to that is, whatever those practical

17

reasons may be, they have to yield to the examination of

the principles --

Well, there is no question on the

merits, but on the severability issue it seems to me you

21

are being kind of piggy.

23

MR. LEE;

If the Court will agree with me on

the second proposition, that it should not reach -- our

preferred approach would be never to reach the

QUESTION:

MR. LEE:

If you decide the

8

It is excisable.

9

presumption that you save rather than destroy.

There is the general strong
In this

10

particular instance Congress said, we want as much saved

11

as possibly can be saved, because there is a

12

severability clause, and perhaps strongest of all, if

13

our view prevails, that is, that the statute — that

14

this particular provision is severable, then the net

15

result is going to be the same as has occurred over the

16

42 years of this statute's history, in over 96 percent

17

of the cases, whereas if the statute is not severable,

then the result is going to be the same as it has been

in less than 4 percent of the cases.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, let me get straight, with

MR. LEE:

But the short answer, Justice

Brennan, is that it makes a very great difference to

3

him, because he becomes a citizen about two years

4

earlier if this Court affirms the court of appeals than

if he has to go through the other procedures.

citizenship is a very important interest, and

3

advantage than citizenship later.

4

If Mr. Gressman were correct that the only

5

test under the necessary and proper clause was whether

6

there were this fit between means and end, it would

repeal Article I, Section 7.

not say that Congress has the power to do anything that

it deems to be necessary and proper.

Article I, Section

11

has the power to make all laws which may be necessary

12

and proper for carrying to execution the foregoing power.

13

There is no defect more fundamental to my

14

opponents' case than simply the fact that they have

15

completely ignored Article I of the Constitution, the

16

requirement in Section 1 of bicameral passage, and in

17

Section 7 of presentation to the President, and the

18

necessary and proper clause helps them not at all,

19

because it gives them only the power to enact laws.

20

I simply close where I started, that there was

21

no concern manifest by the Framers of our Constitution

22

any greater than that that was expressed in Buckley

This Court held in both Buckley against Valeo

Thus, under this Court’s test, the burden of

Isn't that -- if you are talking

MR. MORRISON;

difficult.

I think that that is -- that is in a way the

20

inquiry which has been made in every one of these

21

cases.

22

involving equal protection when we have problems of

underinclusion or overinclusion, what would Congress

have wanted to do if it knew — if it couldn't have

Indeed, it is made in the case -- cases

66

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

this Court has had to deal with it.

2

Mr. Gressman, the California -- Califano against Wescott

3

had to deal with precisely the same question, and I

4

might say dealt with it in every case after reaching the

5

constitutional issue.

The case cited by

6

And I agree that it is difficult in theory,

7

but we have to make these determinations, and in this

8

case, however, we suggest that the legislative history

9

is very strong, and strongly supports the conclusion

10

that Congress would not have, if you will, thrown out

11

the baby with the bath water, if it had been faced with

12

that choice, and I base that on the progression of

13

changes that were made from 1940 through 1962, in which

14

Congress showed a pattern of increasing the categories

15

of eligible people, of making it easier for those found

16

eligible to obtain a hardship stay of deportation, and

17

further from the Congress's willingness to lessen the

18

controls over the process.
Indeed, if you put the options as between the

19

20

private bill analogy, if you strike 242(c)(2), and leave

21

it to the Attorney General alone analogy. Congress

22

between

24

required two-House approval upon a recommendation by the

Attorney General.

unworkable.

2

so finally, in 1952, when the Immigration Act was next-

3

amended, they did away with the two-House approval for

4

large segments of the aliens who were seeking hardship

5

adjustments.

They couldn't deal with the problem.

And

In 1962, there was a further chipping away at

6
7

that.

The Congress consistently made it easier, showed

8

that they did not want the job of going through the

9

private bills.

Congresses that made a change in

clear that the burden is upon the party seeking to

destroy, and not the party seeking to sever, and we

13

respectfully suggest that it is not evident, as this

14

Court has used the term, that Congress would have wanted

15

to throw out this whole humanitarian program, and indeed

16

perhaps call into question the legality of aliens who

17

have already run the Congressional gauntlet, to throw

18

this entire program out if it could not have retained

19

the veto.

It is just too small a portion.

under another statute, such as the War Powers Act or

2

Reorganization Act, it hasn't made its case here.

3

Turning to the merits, I want to say that I

4

fully agree with the Solicitor General's position here,

5

support his argument, support the Ninth Circuit, and

6

also the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of

7

Columbia Circuit in the Consumer Energy Council case.

I want to focus, if I can, on the separation
of powers arguments, and particularly before doing that

10

I want to say a word about the necessary and proper

11

clause upon which counsel for the House places such

12

great reliance.

13

and proper clause allowed the Congress to pass the

14

Immigration and Nationality Act and Section 244.

15

is because those were passed by two Houses of Congress,

16

with opportunity for Presidential decision.

17

It is no doubt true that the necessary

That

The question, though, is, does the necessary

18

and proper clause and the alienage clause in Article I,

19

Section 8, authorize the Congress to do what the House

20

of Representatives did in this case, not to pass a

21

statute, but to exercise control over a decision of the

22

executive branch, and we suggest to you that whatever

23

powers the Congress may have, those powers are exercised

24

by two Houses of Congress and the President, with the

25

exception of the specific provisions of the Constitution

1

such as the treaty-making and appointments provision,

2

which are themselves forms of one-House vetoes.

3

Congress has -- the Framers specifically put those in,

4

and as I noted in my brief, this Court in Myers said, we

5

will not lightly imply other forms of one-House vetoes,

6

and that is what we have here.

7

QUESTION;

The

So --

Would you agree, counsel, that if

8

the veto were to be exercised by an independent body,

9

there would be nothing wrong with it?

10

MR. MORRISON;

If by independent body you mean

11

persons who are officers of the United States appointed

12

by the President with the advice and consent of the

13

Senate or otherwise officers within the meaning of

14

Buckley against Valeo, I would agree with Your Honor

15

that that would be constitutional.

16

that we have an interbranch blending of power, where the

17

Congress -- what has happened here is that Congress is

18

seeking to assign to one branch of it the power to

19

control the activities of the executive branch.

20

QUESTION;

The problem here is

What if this power to control were

21

exercised by a body of six persons, two of whom were

22

legislators?

23

MR. MORRISON;

24

QUESTION;

25

That would be -- well --

The irony of your position, it

seems to me, is that the one class of persons who may

71

not exercise delegated legislative power are people

2

whose primary business in government is lawmaking.

3

MB. MORRISON:

That may be ironic, Mr. Justice

4

Stevens, but I believe that that is the way our

5

Constitution was set up.

6

aspect of what the Framers were concerned about.

7

were concerned, as the cases and the debates show, of

8

blending the power to execute the law with the power to

9

make the law.

That is a terribly important
They

They were fearful of this concentration

10

of power lest tyranny result, and the tyranny they were

11

concerned with was the tyranny of the legislature,

12

indeed, particularly the House of Representatives, and

13

so whatever irony there may seem to be, I would suggest

14

to you that that is an intentional irony in our

15

Constitutional system, designed to prevent the kind of

16

activity which took place in this case here.

17

QUESTION:

So you do suggest, then, that if

18

the -- if the body vested with the power to disapprove

19

was the majority leader of the Senate and the Speaker of

20

the House, it would be unconstitutional?

21

MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

Buckley versus Valeo

22

teaches me that.

I feel compelled -- Let me say a word

23

-- the Senate — the Congress’s response to all of this

24

is, there really isn't a veto here, that all we have is

25

a recommendation going from the Attorney General to the

fallacies with that argument.

mischaracterizes the process we have here.

4

days had taken place, had passed, Jagdish Rai Chadha

5

would have successfully run the Congressional gauntlet,

6

and he would now be a citizen of the United States.

7

fact is that Congress stepped in, not to act with regard

8

to a recommendation, but to veto an act by the executive

9

branch.

The difficulty -- there are two basic

The

The only thing that prevented his being a

10

citizen now was his veto.

Indeed, the House and Senate

11

reports in 1952, when the process went back from

12

two-House approval to one-House veto, described this

13

process as action by the Congress of an adverse action

14

on the alien, so it is pretty clear in terms it is not

15

that.

16

Moreover, all doubt is removed if you consider

17

what happened to the other 334 aliens who were up before

18

the Congress at the same time.

19

Congress, these recommendations were approved by

20

silence, and that silence is the equivalent in

21

constitutional terms to legislation.

22

According to the

Thus, Justice Brennan, you asked earlier

23

whether Congress still has a role after, for instance,

24

the court of appeals decided something.

25

you that nothing in the statute would change the role.

1

It appears that once -- the court of appeals would then

2

issue a decision, it would go back to the executive, and

3

then it would go up to the Congress.

4

Our constitutional system provides that laws

5

shall be made by the vote of the House and the Senate,

6

and not by the silence of its Members, yet if you accept

7

the recommendation analysis, you would have to accept

8

that Members can vote by their silence.
