ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD D. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case involves the application of the federal

11

12 railway laws to state-owned and

state-operated railroads

*»

13 transporting a heavy volume of interstate freight and
14 transporting as well a heavy volume of passengers, both
15 commuter and non-commuter.
The challenged statute is the Railway Labor Act.

16

17 The Railway Labor Act, as evidenced by the numerous
18 decisions in this Court involving it, is a unique statute
19 involving a unique industry.

It was negotiated some 55

20 years ago in conferences between the railroad industry and
21

the railway labor organizations induced by President

22 Coolidge at that time, and they worked out in

1926 this

23 statute as the basis for developing a special rule of labor
24 relations for the railroad industry.

The date of enactment

25 was 1926.

The challenging railroad is the Long Island

2 Railroad.

The Long Island Railroad is one of the oldest

3

railroads in operation.

4

railway laws from the very inception of the earliest law in

5

1887, the Interstate Commerce Act.

6

It has been subject to federal

The question in the case is whether the State of

7

New York

by its act of taking over the business of operating

8

the Long

Island through stock purchase from the Penn Central

9

Railroad

in 1966 withdrew the railroad from the reach of the

10

commerce

clause and therefore from the reach of the Railway

11

Labor Act under the concept set down by this Court in the

12

National League of Cities v. Usery.

13

The District Court held that New York did not

14

succeed in withdrawing this railroad from the reaches of the

15

commerce clause and of the Railway Labor Act, and in so

16

holding it found that this railroad served as a critical

17

physical link in the movement of a heavy volume of

18

interstate freight with other railroads via the New York

19

City gateway connecting Long Island with the rest of the

20 United States.
21

22

And the District Court concluded that the

case was governed by California v. Taylor.
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the

23

action of the state in operating the railroad was a

24

sovereign act within the National League concept.

25

recognized that the Long Island Railroad serves as a crucial

It

1 link in the movement of interstate freight.

Nonetheless, it

2 found that the railroad served an important function in
3 moving a heavy volume of commuters between New York and Long
4 Island, and on this basis distinguished the California v.
5 Taylor case.
6

Now, when the New York —

7

QUESTION:

8 Island.
9

You're saying New York and Long

Isn't Long Island in New York?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Long Island's in the State of New

10 York.
11

QUESTION:

That's what I thought, yes.

12

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Long Island, however, is a very

13 expansive body of real estate.
14

QUESTION:

It extends —

Well, so is Texas, but it's still one

15 state.
16

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, it’s within the state.

This

17 railroad operates within the State of New York, but it
18 operates well outside of the City of New York.

It serves

19 the entire area of Long Island, which is 126 miles long and
20 23 miles wide.

It services the towns in Long Island.

21 it's a freight railroad and it's a commuter railroad.

But
I’ll

22 get to that in just a second.
23

The time for purchase, the railroad, as we have

24 noted in our brief, assured the public and assured the
25 employees of the Long Island Railroad that all it was doing
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was buying the stock, the railroad remained a private

2

corporation, the employees remained private employees.

It

3 said that everything was the same; the only thing that was
4 different was that there was a new set of owners and a new
5 board of directors, but otherwise the operation of the
6 railroad was unchanged; the same people would be pounding

7 the same typewriters and pulling the same switches, and that
8 the railroad employees would remain railroad employees

9 subject to federal railway law, specifically the Railway
10

11
12

Labor Act.

And that’s the way it has been.
Now, this railroad is the only common carrier by

railroad serving Long Island, serving the Nassau and Suffolk

13 County in Long Island, the furthestmost reaches.

There's a

14 map of Long Island which I attached to the brief to the
15 sense of the relationship of the trackage in this railroad
16 to the trackage in New York City.
17

The railroad has something like 325 miles of track

18 radiating throughout the entire length and width of Long
19 Island, serving the Long Island towns.
20

QUESTION:

When it's running.

21

HR. FRIEDMAN:

22 understand, Your Honor,

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FRIEDMAN:

When it’s running.

Well, I

that they're —

I used to live up there.
They're making efforts to run it on

25 time, and I think they’re succeeding fairly well.

The

1

railroad does connect with — its terminal is the

2 Pennsylvania Station in New York City,

and it connects with

3 the Pennsylvania Station over the old Penn Central tracks,
4 now the ConRail tracks, over which it has trackage rights.
5 So its tracks connect with the ConRail tracks, and it moves
6 under the East River ConRail tunnel and terminates in

7 Pennsylvania Station.
8

QUESTIONS

Do they unload some of the freight onto

9 ConRail trains?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

10

Yes.

The freight is unloaded — it

11

interchanges its interstate freight through ConRail at Long

12

Island yards called Fresh Ponds, Long Island.

It's at that

13 point that the railroad connects with the national railroads
14 throughout the United States.
15 at Fresh Ponds.

The interchange takes place

At that point the Long Island Railroad will

16 move the freight cars to various classification yards which
17 it has in Long Island for eventual distribution throughout
18 the Island.
19

QUESTION!

20

MR. FRIEDMAN;

21

How many freight cars do they have?
Well, on this record the District

Court found 41,000 freight cars for the year 1978.

22

QUESTION;

So far I’ve never seen one.

I’ve never

23 seen one.
24

MR. FRIEDMAN;

25

QUESTION;

Well, if you look in those yards —

They only did four percent freight.

1

HR. FRIEDMAN;

2

QUESTION:

3

No — four percent freight?

Four percent of the revenue of the Long

Island Railroad is freight.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

4

Hell, the figures that I have, and

5

the reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission are in

this record, shows $20 million of freight —

Well, this is where I got the four

percent.

MR. FRIEDMANS

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. FRIEDMAN;

12

3

No.

I guess I read the wrong figure.
Well, I think Respondent uses the

figure four percent, but in using that figure he's using the
subsidies which the state receives, I believe, from the

4 State of New York.

If we're looking at revenue, the

5 passenger revenue on the Long Island for the year

'78, which

6 is the year on which this record was based, was something in
7 the neighborhood of $126 million, and the freight revenue
8 was in the neighborhood of

QUESTION:

Is this the Long Island Railroad's yard

ME. FRIEDMAN;

These are Long Island Railroad

3

yards.

4

freight is a principal part of its operation as far as this

There are seven of them.

5 area is concerned.

6

And the carriage of

It carried 2 million tons of freight in

1978 on the 41,000 cars.

It returned those cars either

7 loaded into the interstate system through ConRail and spread
8 throughout the United States in the connecting carriers, or

9 if it didn’t have enough traffic to fill those cars, it had
10

to return those cars unloaded, and those unloaded cars would

11

be returned to the national freight car pool in the United

12

States through the interchange with ConRail.

13

The freight revenue is derived largely from

14 divisions,

and these divisions are shares of a line haul

Now, its share from the divisions, which is all

19

20 subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, was about $12
21

million in 1978 exclusive of surcharges, and the $12

22 represented about 18 percent of the line haul revenue.
23 Long Island's share was

18 percent.

The

It also added to the

24 divisions something called a surcharge under the Railroad

Act, and that surcharge was 12

1/2 percent flat,

which produced another $6 or $7 million in 1978.

The

3

recently disallowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission as

4

not compatible with the standards.

5

surcharge was before this Court on petition of the Long

The case involving the

6 Island Railroad a few years ago in a case called Long Island
7

Railroad v. Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad in which this

8 Court remanded the case to the Interstate Commerce
9
10

Commission with directions as to the handling of the refunds
on the disallowed surcharge.

11

Long Island at the time of the surcharge

12

proceeding filed an application with the ICC for an increase

13

in the amount of its divisions; it wanted a greater share.

14

That was disallowed.

15

disallowance, it filed a new set of surcharges in about the

16

same amount as the disallowed surcharges of 12 1/2 percent,

17

and this time its action was taken under the Staggers Rail

18

Deregulation Act of 1981 which allows carriers to file

19

surcharges of this nature.

And most recently, following the

These surcharges were also

20 challenged by the national railroad, and that proceeding is
21

22

now pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Now, in addition to this activity, the railroad

23

carries — it sells 260,000, on this record, commutation and

24

non-commutation tickets.

25

90,000 represent commuters traveling to and from Long Island

Of the 260,000 tickets, about

The balance represents passengers who are

2 buying fares at the basic rate.

The word "commuter” is

3

derived from the word "commutation" which means to lower the

rate in a situation of this kind.

As I said, its revenues from its passenger

The passengers are pulled by electric

Now, the essence of National League of Cities is

QUESTION:

Sr. Friedman, may I ask, did Congress

2 recently amend some statute addressed expressly to this

3 railroad ?
4

MR. FRIEDMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

7 Railway Labor Act.

Yes, it did. Your Honor.

What was that?
That was an amendment to the

That arose, as I read the record, in

8 connection with the new development in which ConRail, which

9 has been servicing the passenger service between New York
10 City and New Haven, is going to yield that service.

A new

11

corporation has been formed called the Amtrak Commuter

12

Corporation which either will take over the service over a

13 state will take over the service.
14

New York made its position known to the Congress

15 that if the Congress would amend the Railway Labor Act to
16 exclude the commuter railroads altogether, then New York
17 State would be interested in taking over the commuter
18 service to New Haven.

Congress refused to amend the Railway

19 Labor Act to exclude commuter railroads, but it did provide
20

a new system which extends this interminable process of

21

negotiating under the Railway Labor Act which was developed

22 in

1926 by about 240 days.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I can give that to you.

Are you suggesting whatever the general

language is, the Long Island falls within it.

12

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, yes.

The Long Island is

13

clearly within it and it's in consequence of the -- I have

15

— "The provisions of this section shall apply to any

2

QUESTION:

And is there a prohibition in that

3 statute against striking while that interminable procedure
4 goes on?
5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

The provisions of the Railway

6 Labor Act would apply to prohibit any strike until such time

7 as the case has been freed of all of these loops through
8 which the collective bargaining goes.

9 provision in that act which is new.

And there's one other
I should say that the

10

Railway Labor Act is designed to avoid strikes.

11

purpose was to minimize and avoid strikes, and it's been

12

successful in that regard.

13

Its whole

The amendments to the commuter act prohibit

14 secondary strikes, which is something new in the railway
15 labor jargon, if the Court remembers the secondaries in the
16 Jacksonville Terminal case.

But secondary strikes, strikes

17 by the freight service cannot in any way be extended to the
18 commuter service; so it ensures continued operation of the
19 commuter service.

If there's a commuter dispute it goes

20 through this interminable process plus 240 days.
21

Now, California v. Taylor was expressly confirmed

22 in National League of Cities.

It was the only example given

23 in footnote 18 of the kind of an activity which is not to be
24 regarded as traditional; and it was at that time said in
25 explanation that the states have never regarded the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

operation of a railroad in interstate commerce as a

2

traditional activity, and that’s the case here.

3

has attested to this fact.

And all of the other railroads either

10

11

12

activities of railroads subject to railroad laws.

13

must be.

And so it

As Justice Rehnguist noted in Frye v. U.S., if I

14
15

may paraphrase it, the activity of a state in running a

16

railroad in interstate commerce is so unlike the traditional

17

government activities that it has always been regarded as a

18

part of a nationwide railway system; and that's the fact

19

today.

20
21

Long Island Railroad is unique.

It’s the only

railroad owned — it's the only freight-commuter railroad

22 owned and operated by a state, carrying the amount of
23
24
25

freight and the amount of passengers which it has.
So we submit that this case falls well short of
satisfying this Court's test of traditionality as explicitly
16

identified in footnote 18

But even apart from the

2 foregoing, as we point out in our brief, we feel that the
3

Respondents have failed to satisfy any of the tests of the

4

National League of Cities; and I'd like to refer explicitly

5

to the intrusion test, the concept being that the federal

6 government may not intrude into the sovereign affairs of the
7

state by interfering or disrupting its processes in which it

8 functions as a state within a national system.

Mr. Schwartz.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8 may it please the Court:
9

The United States has participated in this case in

10

order to defend the constitutionality of the Railway Labor

11

Act which has been called in question in this case as it is

12

applied to a railroad operated by a state instrumentality.

13

The case, of course, involves the application of

14

the Court's decision in National League of Cities v. Usery.

15

It is our basic submission that the decision of the Court of

16

Appeals under review represents a substantial and

17

unwarranted alteration and extension of the test enunciated

18

in National League of Cities regarding the doctrine of

19

intergovernmental immunity.

And we submit that a careful

20 reading of the Court's opinion and an examination of the
21

considerations that underlie it would lead the Court to

22 conclude, should lead this Court to conclude that the
23

decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.

24

In National League of Cities the Court held —

25

QUESTION:

What if none of the statements had been

1

made your colleague alluded to?

What if they had simply

2 purchased the stock and operated as they have operated with
3

no public utterances about the nature of the enterprise?

4

ME. SCHWARTZ*

While those factors certainly, I

5

think, strengthen the Petitioner's case here, we don't think

6

their absences would be sufficient to require a different

7

result from that for which we contend.

There are certainly

8 many other indicators of the state's subjective intentions
9
10

in this respect, and that in itself, as I hope to explain,
would not be sufficient.
The state chose as a matter of state law to

11

12 classify the employees of this railroad as not state
13

employees.

Perhaps that's a public utterance, but we would

14

submit it's an utterance of the most fundamental kind.

15

the state had taken no action at all, we would think that

16

one would still look to the conduct of the other states and

17

the expectations of states generally, and particularly in

18

this area we would look to this Court's decision in

19

California v. Taylor, which had been decided nine years

If

20 earlier, in which the state must be bound to have been aware
21

in taking over the railroad.

22

It is our submission that a state could not by its

23

unilateral action in assuming a function which has long been

24

subject to what we contend is a very core aspect of the

25

commerce power, cannot remove that authority away from

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

Congress
We see this case as most fundamentally analogous

3

to the Court's decision in Case v. Bowles in which this

4

Court also took, the trouble to distinguish rather than

5

overrule in National League of Cities.

The Court explained

6 that the power there involved the war power which was the
7

basis on which the Court upheld the emergency price

8 restrictions.
9

And the issue in that case was one of the

purposes for which the United States and the federal

10

Constitution were created, and that that required that the

11

case be distinguished.

12

QUESTION;

Is it your position that there is no

13

way at all that a municipal corporation could buy and

14

operate a railroad without being subject to the federal

15

jurisdiction ?

16

MR. SCHWARTZ;

It is our position that given the

17

history which we do have that the way that could be

18

accomplished is by amendment of the Railway Labor Act or

19

amendment of the Constitution.

20

QUESTION;

21

Well, I mean given your view of the

present law, is there any corporate mechanism or any other

22 way of handling the transaction that would take them out
23
24
25

from under the RLA?
MR. SCHWARTZ;

Essentially, as long as the

railroad operates in interstate commerce pursuant to the
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

terms defined by the Interstate Commerce Act, which is not

2 necessarily true of all commuter railroads but has been held
3

to be true here and is not challenged in this Court here,

4

that is our position.

5

QUESTION:

Would that be your position if the

6 state had constituted the employees of the railroad
7

employees of the state, which I understand did not happen

8 here •
9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, that would be our position.

10

Again, that is one of the factors which we feel tends to

11

reveal the state’s subjective intent; and there is at least

12

language in the Court’s decision in National League of

13

Cities which looks to the state’s subjective intent.

14

believe Mr. Justice Rehnguist’s language is the states have

15

not regarded.

16

Now, we see several elements there:

I

the intention

17

of the particular state involved, but more importantly, the

18

intentions of the state generally.

19

anomalous pattern of behavior we think cannot change the

20

character of what is essential to federal sovereignty as

21

opposed to what is essential to state sovereignty.

22

QUESTION:

One state with an

But if a railroad really is just a

23

commuter line and has never been part of the interstate

24

system, the answer to the Chief Justice’s question is yes,

25

they can — it will not be subject to the Railway Labor Act.
21

2

MR. SCHWARTZt

Right.

But that’s not a change.

If that were so, that would already be —

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but the question was is there any

4

way that a city can acquire a railroad without being

5

subject.

MR. SCHWARTZi

6
7

Yes, there is.
Yes, there is, if it has chosen to

acquire a railroad which is not an interstate railroad.

He

8 would also submit that it was quite obvious to the State of
9

New York that this was the character of the railroad it was

10

buying; and there has been no contention here, and I think

11

we would stoutly resist any contention that Congress drew an

12 irrational line in defining as carriers subject to the
13

Interstate Commerce Act carriers which do business in

14

interstate commerce.

15

the furthest recesses of its commerce power.

16

submit that it’s likely that the operations of an intrastate

17 commuter railroad,
18

Congress in fact did not reach out to

particularly serving the City of New

York, might be held to sufficiently affect commerce —

20

MR. SCHWARTZ;

21

We would

that far.

To be within the reach.
Yes, but Congress did not reach out

It kept its elbows a little closer in to its

22 body, and we think reasonably so; and the State of New York
23 nevertheless ran afoul of the line that Congress drew
24

in

defining those interstate railroads, i.e., all carriers

25 which participate in interstate commerce.

QUESTION:

And the purchase of the state does not

2 change that.

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

4

QUESTION*

Yes, that's correct. Your Honor.

So, I mean you don't have to go any

5 further than that, do you?

Once it's declared to be in

6 interstate commerce, under the Interstate Commerce Act it

7 comes under the RLA, and the fact that a state purchased it
8 doesn't change that point.

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Because after the decision in

10

National League of Cities we would be obliged to say that it

11

is because of the sequence there that is so, whereas if the

12

Railway Labor Act were enacted in 1981 and the Long Island

13 Railroad had been a state function like many other states,
14 had operated for 30 or 40 years, the answer might be
15 different.
16

QUESTION:

I guess I was unsuccessful in trying to

17 get you not to rely solely on the League of Cities.

I don't

18 think you need it.
19

MR. SCHWARTZ*

I'm not sure I understand what

20 you're driving at, Mr. Justice Marshall.
21

It is stoutly

contended here that National League of Cities is

22 applicable.

We resist that.

And it is the law of Court.

23

QUESTION:

That's where I was trying to get.

QUESTION:

But you'd be making the same arguments

25 if National League had never been decided.

That is —

I think perhaps my brother Mr.

In National League of Cities the Court held that
Congress -- excuse me.
QUESTION:

You perhaps would be trying to get us

15

to decide the issue the same way it was decided in the

16

National League of Cities.

17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

Complete with the recognition

18

that there are state functions which are not traditional and

19

integral to state sovereignty, as we contend here is the

20

case with the operation of the Long Island Railroad.

21

I'd like to compare this case with National League

22 of Cities itself to point out a few salient features which
23

we think require distinguishing that case on the assumption

24

that it is the law with which we must contend.

25

The statute at issue in National League of Cities
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was a very different statute, and the chronology was a very

2 different statute.
3

In National League of Cities the Court was
confronted with some 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor

6 Standards Act.
7

Those amendments eliminated a longstanding

immunity for state and local government employees who had

8 been exempted from the coverage of that act.
9

And we contend

that those are very important factors.

4
5

It was very different.

The act itself

set rigid standards, and the Court focused on the rigidity

10

of those standards, for the wages and hours of employees.

11

But as I say, state and local government employees were not

12

covered.

13

Labor Standards Act was enacted.

14

And that was so starting in 1938 when the Fair

Congress reversed fields rather sharply in 1974,

15

subjecting what this Court described as almost all public

16

employees employed by the states or various political

17

subdivisions to the Act.

18

police protection, fire prevention, public health,

19

sanitation, parks and recreation.

Among the functions covered were

And those were activities

20 which the Court described — and I quote again — as "well
21

within the traditional operations of state and local

22 governments.
23

This case stands in sharp contrast to National

24

League of Cities.

The statute is one of the most narrowly

25

drawn instruments you could imagine.

It applies to one

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

industry, an industry which the Court has described in

2

California v. Taylor as a state within a state, noting its

3 unique characteristics.

And of course, as has been said, it

4 is in the history which the Court singled out,
5 characterizing in National League of Cities as one not
6

within the realm of protected state sovereignty.

7

Another factor which we believe serves to

8 distinguish this case from the National League of Cities is

9 the pervasive and longstanding character of federal
10

regulation of the railroads.

It really needs no citation to

11

point out that: the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 whose

12

terms determine the applicability of the Railway Labor Act

13 is the seminal exercise of the federal commerce power.

It's

14 really the context in which this Court has defined that
15 power.

And the subject, of course, was railroads, and this

16 Court has essentially invariably upheld the exercise of that
17 power.

There are few areas —

Er. Schwartz, had not the federal

MR. SCHWARTZs

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, but we

23 would make several distinctions.

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Yes

But the point that we

2 consider truly critical —

3

QUESTION:

There’s a constitutional distinction

4 between 40 years and 60 years?
5
6

MR. SCHWARTZ:

No, not necessarily, Your Honor, I

would answer, but we think what is the clear way of

7 resolving this case which avoids some gray areas which may
8

exist is to point to the fact that the federal statute and

9 cognate statutes had been in effect long before the state
10 came into the area.

Therefore, the state could have no

11

reasonable expectation of freedom from the federal

12

regulation, and it assumed whatever burden that regulation

13 carried.

We, of course, contend that was quite a minimal

14 burden.
15

In National League of Cities the states

16 unquestionably got there first.

There is some dispute

17 between the parties as to exactly how long the states had
18 been doing some of those functions, whether police was a
19 public function in the nighttime or the daytime in the City
20 of New York in
21

1652 or 1852.

And we could debate the

historical points, but we think it's simply unnecessary to

22 get into those areas which may have a shade of gray because

23 it cannot be denied that the federal government pursuant to
24 its core commerce power functions got here a long time
25 before the state.

And although I don't think it’s

2 by the fact that the Court had already decided California v.
3 Taylor and had spoken as to what happens in exactly this
4 situation.
5

There may well be issues as to how many years is

6 enough to make something traditional# and I think it’s
7 probably appropriate to point out that those issues will not
8 likely escape this Court even if they escape decision here.
9 There’s a lot of discussion both in Respondent's brief and
10 particularly in the briefs of some of the amici curiae about
11 mass transit generally.

We, of course, have submitted in

12 our brief that these commuter railroads, because of their
13 history and physical nature, are distinct from mass transit
14 generally.
15

I don’t know whether I should telegraph punches to

16 the Justices, but the Justices may wish to note that a
17 District Court in Texas has invalidated provisions of the
18 Fair Labor Standards Act as applied to mass transit.

The
The

20 Solicitor General has not determined yet whether to file a
21 jurisdictional statement, but it has in other litigation
22 been the Government’s position that those are not

That case will probably

24 wend its way here, and we urge, particularly because of that
25 fact, that there is no reason to reach out for those issues

Here we're getting back to almost 200-year old

We submit that all

4 these things which may sound fanciful illustrate the
5 fundamental commerce power question which is entailed today.
6

There are many reasons why we believe the Court

7 should not abandon the language in National League of Cities
8 which comes, as I understand it, from Mr. Justice
9 Rehnquist's dissent in Frye v. United States, stressing the
10
11

importance of traditional functions.
It seems to us that this is essential, inherent in

12 the Constitution itself.

As we read not only National

13 League but tax immunity cases, the reason for this immunity
14 is partly because the states were here before there was a
15 United States.

But of course, that makes it perfectly

16 appropriate to look to the functions which the states did or
17 at least were akin enough to those functions to be regarded
18 as within the state sovereignty, as distinguished from those
19 functions which were not at all akin to state functions in
20 place in the constitutional period.
21

We would also note one very practical factor

22 touching on separation of powers concerns.

We would suggest

23 that if Respondent's alternative test is adopted. Congress
24 would simply have no way of knowing when it enacts a statute
25 which might in the future come to apply to a state

To

3

pursuant to the political process of a state is within the

4

state sovereignty, by that reason alone statutes will become

5

unconstitutional or not with shifting social and economic

6 considerations; Congress and the lower courts will be left
7

without a compass.

And it seems to us inappropriate to

8 place on Congress by judicial decree what is essentially a
9

sunset requirement; that Congress be faced with the

10

requirement of going through each of its enactments on a

11

periodic basis and determining whether or not changing

12

conditions had made them unconstitutional.

13

This might be a desirable thing to do, but we see

nothing in the Court's decisions or the Constitution itself

15

which requires it.

16

into the domain in which the federal government has long

17

been supreme, assuming a function which is not a traditional

integral state function, we would submit that the state is

not in the position to contest the operation of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS B. KADEN, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3

MR. KADEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

4 the Court;
5

The question before the Court in this case is

6 whether Congress has the power to require a state to permit
7 certain of its employees, employees involved in aspects of
8 public transit, the right to strike.
9

This Court has determined that the Constitution

10 imposes an affirmative limitation on the exercise of the
11 federal commerce power in certain circumstances.

And we

12 submit that the facts of this case — the fact of whether
13 the employees of this state owned and operated railroad
14 should have the right to strike by virtue of federal mandate
15 — fits easily within the critical parameters of the
16 immunity guaranteed by National League of Cities.
17

Those parameters are two;

first, whether the

18 nature of the decision is such, the choice made the state is
19 such that it touches so closely on the essence of
20 sovereignty as to quality for immunity.
21

QUESTION;

22

MR. KADEN;

How about the duty to arbitrate?
We believe that if the federal

23 government prescribed that the state must submit its
24 disputes to arbitration, it would be just as intrusive as
25 prescribing for the state —

By contrast, when the state chooses a location for

Only the state can decide

And I think in the case of the right

14

to strike it’s also the essence of the sovereign decision

15

for this reason.

When a state chooses to engage in

16 collective bargaining as opposed to a private company,
17

what

the state is choosing to do is to describe a method of

18 sharing its governmental responsibility.

It is saying to

19 other interest groups you petition the legislature to get
20

your share of state resources, your share of the pie, but

21

it’s saying to employees you have a special method of

22 participating in decisions affecting you that the
23 government’s going to make.
24
25

That’s what gives rise to the longstanding debate
about whether collective bargaining in government is an

Most states,

because it's so fundamental a choice in terms of the

10

11
12

QUESTION*

What's the difference whether it goes

broke or not?
MR. KADENs

Because the state made a judgment, a

13 judgment, as I say, at the heart of its sovereign power,
14 that the provision of public transit service to this 260,000
15 passengers a day was essential to the social and economic
16 well-being of the metropolitan New York area, and that's
17 what separates it from the spaghetti factory.

No, no.

My spaghetti factory is

19 essential for the jobs in that local neighborhood which is

MR. KADENs

I don't think that the employment

14 and I submit that we don't have, even in these troubled

The Congress —

MR. KADEN;

No, not at all.

It decided that the

states had an immunity from the exercise of certain federal

wages and maximum hours for certain categories of state

8 employees.

And the question before the Court here is simply

9

whether this service, transit service provided in the

10

metropolitan area of New York through the Long Island

11

Railroad qualifies or not.

12

On the question of whether the decision qualifies,

13

whether the structuring of employment conditions qualifies,

14

I would submit that that really has been decided.

resolves the question, because these problems of which

The first is collective benefit

In most cases

20 unlike the telephone company at issue in another case,
21

unlike even the Boston Street Railway at issue in Helvering

22 v. Powers,

this public transit service in New York is

23

provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with

24

subsidies amounting to more than a billion dollars a year

25

because there is no alternative and because the public

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

depends on this service
If you take away the Long Island Railroad service

3 from the 260,000 passengers a day and you take away the bus
4 and subway service from the millions of passengers who
5 depend on it, the economy and the society in New York as we
6

7

know it collapses.
That’s why transit service has occupied such an

8 important place in the public agenda in recent years.

The

9 fact that it didn’t have that place on the agenda 50 years
10

ago or 100 years ago does not, in my view, disqualify it

11

from the immunity afforded by National League of Cities,

12

because the question must be what public services are those

13 which the state most needs.
14

If you take the Government’s view and say a

15 railroad is a railroad, it’s still part of the national
16 railroad system because it does this little bit of freight
17 traffic, if we abandoned the freight, the case wouldn’t be
18 before you because the statutory jurisdiction would be
19 eliminated.
20

21

It would then be a commuter railroad operating

in one state and not subject to the Railway Labor Act at all.
Because we do, because we do get three or four

22 percent of our revenue from freight traffic, a percentage

23 declining every year, we’re subject to the statute, and
24 therefore the constitutional issue arises.
25

But I suggest that if you ask yourself, if the

And if you decide, as the Government urges, that

10
11

this is somehow unique, this is a railroad, it's part of the

world of railroading and the immunity doesn't apply, the

13

next case to come before you is the bus and subway system in

Well, has the subway changed since I

22

MR. KADEN:

I have no doubt that just as Congress

23

in 1974 applied the minimum wage — or 1966 — applied the

24

minimum wage to the bus and subway system, they could apply

a collective bargaining law if this immunity established by

2 backdrop where it's underlying character, its fundamental
3

character of the service qualifies for the immunity, the

4

incidental activity can't dictate the result.

5

QUESTION;

Your opposing counsel suggested that

6

that was a ratio of about 6 to 1 freight to passenger.

7

suggest it's just a three or four percent.

8

MR. KADEN;

9

QUESTION;

10

Yes.

You

Let me clarify the statistics.

Is it two different statistics?

MR. KADEN;

I don't think anyone doubts that in

11

1981 we received some $9 or $10 million from freight revenue

12

after you deduct the freight surcharge which the ICC has

13

required be reimbursed.

14

with about $200 million of operating revenue — that's 10

15

percent — and over $400 million of total revenue, including

16

public subsidies.

That $9 or $10 million contrasts

17

And my figure of four percent, which was based on

18

1979, would now actually be about 2 1/2 percent for 1981 if

19

you look at the total revenue picture rather than just the

20 fare box revenue.
21

And I suggest that on one level the

statistics don't matter whether it's four percent or six

22 percent or two percent.

What we do know from the historical

23

record is that the amount of freight service is declining;

24

as a result of freight rate deregulation it is likely to

25

decline further.
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

And ray point is that the basic character of the

railroad is a part of the transit system of metropolitan New

character cannot be divested by virtue of four, or two, or

The answer would be no, wouldn't it?
— I think the answer would be no.

14

That is no less an employment condition than a minimum wage,

15

and certainly no less than prescribing a method of waste

16

determination.

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. KADEN;

19

I think in the case of social security

the matter may be more difficult.
QUESTION;

20
21

How about social security taxes?

Why isn't it the same question?

It

seems to me that of course all state —
MR. KADEN;

22

I think the degree of intrusion is

23

much less.

You are not necessarily displacing, subjecting

24

the public employees.

sure about the earlier cases on social security.

And I’m not sure.

I must say I'm not

QUESTION;

Sell, are these employees really

3

HR. KADEN;

Yes.

There's no question that now

they are.

5

QUESTION;

6

HR. KADEN;

I mean they're on the official roster.
They are on the official roster of the

7

state by virtue of the action the MTA took in 1980 to change

8

the Long Island from a subsidiary stock corporation to a

9

public benefit corporation.

10

And the Government makes much of the fact that for

11

many years the HTA consented or accepted their status as

12

non-public employees, but my argument is that the important

13

thing is the state's choice.

14

sovereign choice sometimes well, sometimes poorly, sometimes

15

late; but what the Constitution protects by virtue of

16

National League of Cities is the power to make those choices

17

in areas at the heart of the exercise of sovereignty.

18

the right to strike, if the prescription of employment

19

conditions is such a qualifying decision, then the state has

The state will exercise its

If

20 the right to make that choice in 1980 just as much as it had
21

the right to make the choice in 1966.

22

In point of fact what happened is new leadership,

23

new problems in the state involving a transit crisis, a new

24

attention to the means of infusing into the system the kind

25

of capital that the transit system needed was associated
53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

with a judgment that that capital financing program had to

2 be closely related with a coordinated approach to collective
3

bargaining.

4

and subway workers, the Triborough Bridge workers were

5

subject to the state's collective bargaining procedures, and

6

the 6800 employees of the Long Island operated under an

7

entirely different regime with different rules and different

8

procedures.
QUESTION*

10

And you couldn't have a system in which the bus

Which they had been operating under for

how many years?

11

MR. KADEN;

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. KADEN:

Since 1834, 1844.
So all of a sudden it was awful.
They had been operating as a railroad

14
15

QUESTION;

16

MR. KADEN:

17

All of a sudden it became horrible.
It became horrible, Mr. Justice

Marshall —

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. KADEN:

Because you went broke.
Exactly.

Because the transit system

20 is broke and is operating as a drain to the tune of more
21

than a billion dollars a year on tax proceeds.
QUESTION;

22
23
24
25

So you want to take that out of the

workers.
MR. KADEN;

No, not at all.

In fact, we believe

that under state law, as has been true in the bus and subway
54

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

system, we will have good collective bargaining, we will

2 have fair wage settlements,

we will avoid strikes hopefully,

3 although as you know, we did not in 1980, and we will have
4 most of all the State of New York making its own choice
5 about the way in which authority is to be shared with
6 employee organizations.

7

And in these circumstances, I think as Solicitor

8 General Bork conceded in the National League of Cities

9 argument, that decision on the design of collective
10

bargaining procedures is at the very center of sovereign

11

power.

There’s no choice, no decision in this day and age

12 that a state government makes that is as important to the

13 exercise of its governmental authority as its choice about
14 how and when and whether to engage in collective bargaining.
15

And we submit, on the other side of the case, that

16 there’s no service that the state provides that is as much
17 at the heart of sovereign power in the sense of public
18 dependence and the lack of available alternatives than is
19 transit service.
20
21

Finally, the fact of the matter is when the State
of New York through the MTA addresses transit problems, it

i

22 doesn’t distinguish between the Long Island Railroad and the

23 bus and subway system.

It decides — I mean what, after

24 all, does the MTA chairman and the board decide?
25 people to run those services.

They pick

They decide on a capital
55

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

budget program, including last year's authorization for $7.8

2

billion of improved capital improvements, $750 million on

3 the Long Island Railroad; and they decide how to structure
4 their relationships with the employees who provide the
5 service, and how to negotiate fairly with them.
6

fill those decisions are made by the chairman and

7 the board of the MTA not by saying the Long Island is
8 different from the bus and subway system; they’re all part

9 of the same system.

And in fact, even the technology is

10

hard to distinguish.

Certainly the Long Island still has

11

point-to-point fares, and they still have conductors

12

collecting tickets, but three-quarters of their passenger

13 cars are self-propelled electrical cars drawing electric
14 power from a third rail.
15

The definition that APTA, the trade association,

16 has to distinguish a heavy rail subway from a commuter
17 railroad is that a commuter railroad is featured by
18 point-to-point fares and railroad employment practices.

And

19 I suggest that the question of whether this commuter
20

railroad should have railroad employment practices is not a

21

definition that distinguishes it from subways; it’s the very

22 issue in the case.

It’s the question of whether this is a

23 service that qualifies for immunity for those federal
24 commerce regulations that go to the heart of the state's
25 exercise of its sovereignty.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything further, Mr. Friedman?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD D. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- Rebuttal

6

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Court;
8

I would like to make two comments in response to

9 some of the questions.

I would like to say that New York

10 has been operating the Long Island Railroad for 14 years and
11

is operating it today under federal laws, federal railway

12 laws, interconnecting with other railroads throughout the
13 United States; and there's no suggestion that its existence
14 as a state has in any way been threatened by this state of
15 affairs.
16

I should also like to point out that in the

17 proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission on the
18 freight surcharge it represented to the Interstate Commerce
19 Commission that its rate structure was in line with ConRail
20 and with other railroads.
21

It also represented before the Interstate Commerce

22 Commission that it had no plan of any kind to give up its
23 freight service; that if it gave up its freight service,
24 some 200,000 trucks would be required to pick up whatever
25 part of its freight that trucks could carry.

And this

57

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 railroad carries the freight of freight trains.

It carries

2 coal, and copper, foodstuffs, paper and paper products, and
3 the run of freight activity.
4

QUESTION:

Is its trackage such that even if it

5 reduced it could never likely be eliminated?
6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

If the trackage were reduced?

No, no.

Is the trackage structure,

8 since that’s not in this record, is it such that it’s going
9 to continue with this kind of freight —
10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

All the indications in the

11 proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission and in
12 statements by the president of this organization are that it
13 has every intention of continuing with this service.

It

14 represented to the Commerce Commission, there were
15 suggestions in the record, that the freight service may be
16 cross-subsidizing the passenger service, because if they
17 were to give up the freight, a good part of the actual cost
18 of operating the freight system would still continue
19 necessarily because they would be operating the passenger
20 system over the same tracks and the same facilities.
21

They also represented or it was also said that the

22 economy of this whole region will be affected adversely if
23 they give up freight.

The Long Island is now engaged in a

24 study to try to determine whether there is any
25 cross-subsidization.

The allocation of cost between

passenger service and freight service has created a problem

The surcharge has to

It's dollars collected for freight in order to

8 pay its expenses.

And still today it replaced that

And it carries two

This

QUESTION*

Well, even the National League of

13 Cities argument includes the submission that this is a
14 negligible proportion of the Long Island's gross revenue.
15

MR. FRIEDMANS

16

QUESTION;

I don’t understand.

Well, I thought I heard your colleague

17 on the other side say that the freight revenue was only a
18 very minor part of its -19

MR. FRIEDMAN;

20

QUESTION;

21

Two percent.

Two percent.

And he thought that was an important

point in making his National League of Cities argument.

22

MR. FRIEDMAN;

23

QUESTION;

Well,

I think the --

And it is, and it’s part of yours to

24 say that it’s a substantial part.
25

MR. FRIEDMAN;

I'm thinking that if the decision
59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is to go that way, it will be reversing California v. Taylor

2 and United States v. California.

I checked the revenue of

3 California v. Taylor, and that's a terminal railroad serving
4 the docks of New York, about $150,000.

You can hardly

5 compare it — this is a connecting carrier, not a terminal
6 carrier.

This carrier is an important link in the

7 interstate movement as it affects this area of Long Island.
8

I also must think that the railroads, particularly

9 throughout the Northeast, ConRail and others are abandoning
10 unprofitable freight lines and the unprofitable branch
11

lines.

And these branch lines are the lifeblood of the

12 little towns which depended upon them more fundamentally
13 than the 90,000 passengers on Long Island depended upon this.
14

QUESTION;

Well, do you think to sustain the

15 National League of Cities argument would lead to say that
16 the state would have the exclusive decision as to whether
17 the railroad should be abandoned or not?
18

MB. FRIEDMAN;

No.

I don't believe that the

19 National League of Cities touches this case, because this is
20 not a traditional —
21

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but assume we affirm,

22 does that mean that the city would be the exclusive
23 authority on abandonment?
24

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Oh, yes.

As I would read the case

25 or understand it, it would mean that they could withdraw
