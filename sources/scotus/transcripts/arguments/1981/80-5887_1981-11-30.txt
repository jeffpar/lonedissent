ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. RICHARD LARSON, ESQ.

ON EEHALE OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LARSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

9 please the Court:
10

This case involves an award of attorney's fees

11 under the Civil
12 federal

Fights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, a

statute which authorizes fees as a part of costs.

13 There is no issue here about whether the petitioner,

the

14 plaintiff below, was the prevailing party, or whether there
15 was an entitlement to fees under the Fees Act.
16

The issues here instead are procedural.

17 issue concerns the
18 under the Fees Act.

The first

timing of a request for attorney's fees
The second issue concerns the ethical

19 conflicts which arise from the imposition of a requirement
20 that fees be negotiated

simultaneously with the relief for

21 the class on the merits.

22

As to the timing of a fee request, there are at

23 least three views about the proper characterization of fee
24 requests, and hence, of the timing of a fee request.
25

First, is the fee request part of the costs, as
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 defined by Congress, as recognized by this Court in Hutto v
2 Finney, and indeed, in Newman v Piggie Park Enterprises, and
3 as recognized by the drafters of Rule 54(d).
4

Second and quite consistently, is a request for

5 fees a matter to be determined in an independent proceeding,
6 supplemental to the original proceeding, and thus not a
7 request for a modification of the original decree on the
8 merits, as held by this Court in Sprague v Ticonic National
9 Bank, and as recognized by this Court in Bradley v School
10 Board of City of Richmond, and implicitly in Maher v Gagne,
11 decided two years ago.

12

QUESTION;

hr. Larson, is there any recognized

13 time limit for the filing of a bill of costs as such after
14 the prevailing party has gotten his judgment in a lawsuit
15 and it has been affirmed?
16

MB. LARSON;

Justice Rehnquist, generally it is a

17 rule of reasonableness with regard to the district courts.
181 mean, in the Federal Rules itself there is no specific
19 time period with regard to the filing of a bill of costs.
20

What happens within the trial courts, Your Honor,

21 is that very often, the court will decide fees as part of
22 the costs as well as other items of costs quite quickly.
23 other occasions, when appeals are taken, the bill of costs
24 issues, with regard to all items of costs, are sometimes
25 reserved pending the outcome of the appeal.

QUESTION;

But there is a provision in one of the

2 Rule 54 — either 54 or 56 -- that the entry of judgment
3 shall not be delayed because of entry of costs.
4

MR. LARSON;

5 That’s Rule 53.

Nr. Larson, if the time for appeal had

proceeding, yes.

Even if the time for

order had elapsed, costs are still

QUESTION;

Is there no time limit, then, in your

16 view ?
17

NR. LARSON;

Well, we do think -- there are

18 several time limits that could
19 limit that

be applied.

The basic time

is applied by trial courts, Justice O’Connor, is

20 the rule of reasonableness

with regard to, for example, if

21 there are ongoing fee negotiations;

that the trial courts

22 will not allow a request for costs or a request for fees as
23 part of the costs to be made an
24 time, especially when

ME. LAESCNi

Secondly, if I may with regard to

2 Justice O'Connor's question, some district courts do have
3 time limits with regard to

the filings of costs.

4 they are around 30 days, sometimes more.

Usually

But there is a

5 major distinction between these trial.court rules on the
6 filing of costs and
7
8 and

Rule 59(e).

Local court rules are extendable by the courts,
we have to give some consideration to district courts to

9 manage their own dockets with regard to case management.
10
11 under

Pule 59(e), though, the ten-day period there,
Rule 6(b), is not extendable.

12 can be enlarged under

Would a district court entertain a statement

18 of costs four years after the termination of the litigation?
19

MR. LARSON;

If the case had been on appeal and

20 there had been, say, a remand from the United States Supreme
21 Court months previously.
22

QUESTION;

No, say it had simply terminated.

23

MR. LARSON;

Oh, absolutely not.

If it had

24 terminated -- I mean, there is a rule of reason that is
25 applied, even when

there is no district court rule governing

1 the bill of costs.

It’s akin to a laches type of argument.

2 You are entitled to the costs and fees as a part of costs
3 within a reasonable time.

QUESTION:

5 to do with that?

And what would the other side be able

Would they object? .

MR. LARSON:

QUESTION:

8

MR. LARSON:

9 of all,
10

Oh, yes, they could.
And what else could they do?
Similar to a laches argument, first

prejudice is the key.
QUESTION:

Well, this isn't that longstanding, you

11 know, it has only been on the books a few years.

Don't you

12 think it's about time that a rule was established?
13

MR. LARSON:

Well, if a rule -- I believe a rule

14 has been established, as far as the rule of reasonableness,
15 and under Rule 58 and 54(d) —
16

QUESTION:

And the rule of reasonableness is how

17 long?

MR. LARSON:

QUESTION:

It is not long at all.

It has to do

Let's get clear -Well, the rule of reasonableness I

21 understand can extend from one minute to 36 years.

QUESTION:

Don't you think there should be some

4 stability to it, like the ten-day rule that was put in the
5 rules?
6

MR. LARSON:

If there should be some stability, I

7 believe that's for Congress, if there is to be specific
8 rule.

Or it's for the local courts.

9

QUESTION:

Don't you think we can, if Congress

10 does not?
11

NR. LARSON:

I think the obligation of this Court

12 is to interpret what Congress has done, and I think Congress
13 has specified that fees are a part of costs, Your Honor.
14

QUESTION:

15 it's costs or not.

Well, I'm not talking about whether
The question that Justice Rehnquist

16 asked you, four months on costs due, and you said you didn't
17 know.

If it was on appeal or something, or if it wasn't on

18 appeal.
19

NR. LARSON:

Justice Marshall, there really has

20 been no problem with this in the trial courts on the rule of
21 reasonableness.
22
23 here?
24

And let me also point out that there are --

QUESTION:

But then the problem -- what is it

Why is it here?
NR. LARSON:

It is here because the first circuit

25 has imposed an inflexible rule.
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

But don't you think it's here because

2 we wanted to look into it?
3

NR. LARSON;

Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. LARSON;

6

The rule, for example, if 59(e) were applied to

Well, don't mind if we do, please.
Absolutely.

7 this case, that is an inflexible rule that does not allow
8 for extensions under Rule 5(b).

Now, let's recall that

9 although this arose and is here under the Fees Act, there
10 are literally dozens and dozens of fee shifting statutes,
11 and many of them like Section 4 of the Clayton Act, the
12 securities authorizations, and in some of these cases, as in
13 some major Civil Rights cases such as Title VII cases, there
14 are thousands and thousands of hours that are billed.
15

Now, this is not this type of case.

But the

16 district courts need some flexibility to deal with the
17 different type of fee petitions that are filed.

Some of

18 them are a half an inch thick, and some of them are six
19 inches thick, with regard to the affidavits, the time
20 sheets, the briefs that are filed.
21

Under Rule 59(e)

all of these matters, in an

22 inflexible sense, would have to be filed within ten days of
23 the judgment.
24

QUESTION;

Mr. Larson, that isn't quite right.

25 All they have to do is reserve the issue of fees, don't

MB. LARSON:

QUESTION1:

Oh, I don't think so, Justice Stevens.
The judgment says, in so many words,

4 the question of fees will be taken up in six months, or -5

MB. LARSON:

I think a reservation of fees, as the

6 seventh circuit held in Martinez v Trainor in 1977, indeed
7 is an enlargement, and an enlargement is not granted.

Not

8 to be granted under Buie 6(b).
9

QUESTION:

You didn't even ask for them in your

10 pleadings, did you?
11

MB. LARSON:

Well, we have a boilerplate in our

12 pleadings -- and I would also point out that -13

QUESTION:

Well, do we have to approve

14 boilerplates?
15

MR. LABSON:

Our complaint was filed prior to the

16 Fees Act, prior to enactment of the Fees Act and subsequent
17 to this Court's decision in Alyeska.

At the time that the

18 case was filed, there technically was no clear authorization
19 for fees.

There, however, was a boilerplate asking for such

20 just relief.
21

QUESTION:

Well, there was no rule that prevented

22 you from asking for them, as they did in Alyeska.
23

MR. LARSON:

Eight?

Well, as in Alyeska, or after this

24 Court's decision in Alyeska, there was no statutory
25 authorization for fees in a

1983 action.

This was a

1983

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 action.

The Fees Act became effective six months after this

2 case was filed.
3

QUESTION;

Let me go back to reserving fees.

Is

4 it your view that under the first circuit holding, if
5 someone gets in the same position that you were in, five
6 days after judgment the plaintiff went in and said, Your
7 Honor, we left cut the question of fees; would you amend the
8 judgment and add a clause saying the issue of fees shall be
9 reserved for later determination.

Would he have power to do

10 that?
11

ME. LARSON;

I don't think the court would have

12 the power to do that.
13

QUESTION;

He couldn’t amend the judgment within

14 ten day in that way?
15

I don't understand why not.

MR. LARSON;

Okay.

The confluence of Rule 6(b)

16 and the ten-day rules — the ten-day rules are 50(b) and
1752(b) and 59 (b),

(d) and

(e).

6(b) says that there are no

18 extensions of those rules.
19

QUESTION;

What if the original judgment said the

20 matters of fees will be reserved for further determination?
21 It is done in antitrust cases all the time.
22

MR. LARSON;

I know.

23 inconsis tent with Rule 59(e).

That is why it is
That is, in effect, a court

24 extension.
25

What happened in Martinez v Trainor, the seventh
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 circuit case, is that there was simply a skeleton motion
2 filed, and then later a brief and some affidavits were filed
3 outside of the ten-day time limit.
4 recognized

The seventh circuit

that that can occur with regard to only one of

5 the ten-day motions, and that is with.regard to the motion
6 for a new trial, under Pule 59(b),

because Pule 59(c) has a

7 separate specification for affidavits, which is not
8 controlled by the no extension rule in 6(b).
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Larson, this case on the merits

10 went off on a consent decree, didn’t it?
11

MR. LARSON:

12 was appealed;

15 decree,

there was a judgment that

then there were negotiations and it came back

13 down and there was
14

Initially,

a consent decree.

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, don't you think in a consent

ordinarily the parties taken into consideration the

16 possibility of attorney’s fees and negotiate for them,
17 so that when the consent decree is finally filed,

too,

both

18 parties figure that the attorney's fees are taken care of?
19
20 Rehnquist.

MR. LARSON:

On occasion that is done, Justice

But what was followed in this case was the rule

21 that had been announce

in 1977 by the third circuit in

22 Prandini v National Tea Company.

The Prandini court held

23 that it is unethical to engage in simultaneous negotiations
24 of the fees and of the merits.
25

Now, on the record in this case in the trial court
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 on two occasions, respondent's counsel conceded that it
2 would have been unethical under the Prandini rule to engage
3 in simultaneous negotiations.
4

QUESTION;

5

HE. LARSON;

And the court --

But you weren’t in the third circuit.
Sell, as is stated with regard to the

6 ethical issue by respondent's counsel, they were aware — we
7 were in the first circuit, but they were aware of the third
8 circuit decision.

And they thought that it was appropriate

9 law, and they had, indeed,

followed that with regard to

10 simultaneous negotiation.

11

Because of the ethical conflict -- and I should

12 say that the third circuit rule was later followed by the
13 ninth circuit in the Mendoza case, and as of this September,
14 the ethical negotiation, simultaneous negotiation issue,
15 resulted in an ethical opinion by the New York City Bar
16 Association barring simultaneous negotiation of the fees and
17 of the merits.
18

And that is referred to in our reply brief.

QUESTION ;

Do you think that would be binding on

19 the second circuit?
20

MR. LARSON;

The particular ethical opinion

21 binding?

It is not binding, no, but it is a rule that is

22 being followed by attorneys in New York City.

It

23 particularly comes up with regard to the grievance
24 proceedings, of course.
25

QUESTION;

But do you think the second circuit,
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 because cf

the Bar Association of the City of New York,

2 would be bound to follow the --

3

MR. LARSON;

It certainly is not bound to follow

4 it, no.
5

QUESTION;

Mr. Laron, do I understand your

6 argument to be that if

we affirmed the first circuit, a

7 practical effect would be that you would have to file your
8 application for fees within ten days.

And not only that,

9 but the court would have to decide the application within
10 ten days?

11

MR. LARSON;

12 keep in

13

In practical effect, because let's

mind —
QUESTION;

If we affirm, that is what this would

14 mean.
15

MR. LARSON;

16

QUESTION;

Yes, it would, Your Honor.
Whether or not it was an application

17 supported by, as you put it earlier, an inch or six inches,
18 an application six inches thick?

MR. LARSON;

There is no rule in Rule

requiring an immediate decision by the court.

22 finality of

23

Right.

But the

the rule is because of the suspension of a

the underlying judgment --

QUESTION;

Mr. Larson, your reading of the first

24 circuit decision is that both the application would have to
25 be made and the decision on the application reached by the
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 court within ten days.
2

MR. LARSON:

Oh, no, no.

3 have to be made within ten days.

The decision does not
Rule 59(e) basically says

4 that the motion has to be served within ten days, and the
5 courts have interpreted that to mean also filed.

Put the

6 thrust of the rule, it was designed to allow a court to
7 correct an error of judgment, not to rule on new evidentiary
8 matters.
9

QUESTION :

I am just trying to get your reading of

10 the first circuit decision, and all you're telling me now is
11 that it means only that the application has to be made
12 within ten days, and the district judge may sit on it for a
13 year.
14
15a year.
16 rule.

Is that right?
MR. LARSON:

I guess the judge could sit cn it for

That would be, I believe, inconsistent with the
The rule is to encourage quick action, because let’s

17 recall that under Rule 4(a)4 of the Federal Rules of
18 Appellate Procedure, the underlying judgment has been
19 totally stopped now.

It has been suspended, so nobody can

20 appeal from that.
21

In other words, if a plaintiff gets a fairly large

22 injunction in a case, having some substantial impact and
23 then files a fee application within ten days, that prevents
24 the defendant from appealing under

1292(a) the injunction.

25 I mean 59(e) simply was not designed to deal with new
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 evidentiary matters; it was not designed to deal at all with
2 attorney's fees.
3

To the extent that there is a rule, the rule has

4 been decided by Congress with regard to Rules 54(d) and Rule
5 58, entry of judgment -6

QUESTION;

At this point, Nr. Larson, are you

7 resting your case on 54(d)?
3

MR. LARSON;

9

QUESTION;

Certainly, with regard to -In its entirety?

Would you be content,

10 then, to have attorney's fees taxed by the clerk on one
11 day's notice?
12

MR. LARSON;

13

QUESTION;

No.

Congress has --

Then you are not resting entirely on

14 54(d) .
15

MR. LARSON;

Well, this is an application for fees

16 pursuant to the Fees Act, and the Fees Act specifies that
17 fees, as a part of the costs, shall be awarded by the
18 court.

In other words, when you look at 54(d), in the

19 advisory committee notes of 54(d), the advisory committee
20 notes recognize that there were some 20 statutes already
21 dealing with costs, and 12 or 13 of those statutes had
22 authorized fees as a part of costs.

And the advisory

23 committee refers to those statutes as cost statutes and that
24 they were already consistent with Rule 54(d).
25

And in those statutes -- Section 4 of the Clayton
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Act was one

that authorizes the court to award fees as

2 part of the costs.
3

QUESTION;

Could I have your comment, now that I

4 have you interrupted, to the eight circuit's opinion in Obin?
5

MR. LARSON;

With regard to the collateral and

6 independent proceeding that is to be held with regard to
7 fees, as we point out in your brief, hr. Justice Plackmun,
8 we certainly agree with the eighth circuit’s decision.
9

It is also consistent with your decision for this

10 unanimous Court in Bradley v School Board of City of
11 Richmond, where the Court recognized that simultaneous -12 even apart from the ethical issue -- that it is undesirable
13 for a court to engage in simultaneous resolution of the fees
14 and of the merits.

That instead, the fee issue should be

15 dealt with in a separate proceeding.
16

Section 59(e), briefly, we did point out in our

17 brief that 59(e) was designed to handle a situation wholly
18 apart from the consideration of a new evidentiary matter
19 such as fees.

Rule 59(e)

was designed to care for a

20 situation as provided by the eighth circuit in the Boaz
21 case, for a court, a trial court, to correct a judgment.

It

22 was not designed with regard to entirely new matters.
23 Something, as Nr. Justice Brennan indicated, could last for
24 as long as a year in consideration of the fee issue.
25

There is a suspension of finality of judgment
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 here.

59(e) is basically for correction of an error of law.

2 and it was not designed to cover situations such as the
3 filing of fee requests, which sometimes are extraordinarily
4 long.
5

With regard to the collateral and the independent

3 proceeding that is normally held in trial courts, I would
7 like to point out that this is entirely consistent with not
8 only what happened in this Court’s decision in Maher v.
9 Gagne where, as in this case, there was a consent decree
10 that did not mention fees, and this Court went on and
11 considered and held that consistent with the legislative
12 history of the Fees Act that a prevailing plaintiff can
13 become a prevailing plaintiff through a consent decree.
14

Now, in the legislative history, in both the

15 Senate report and in the House report, the Congress
16 recognizes that fees flow from the judgment, and that as a
17 result of a consent decree, a plaintiff thereafter can be
18 determined to be, in an independent proceeding, a prevailing
19 party.
20

If there are no further questions at this time,

21 Your Honors,
22

I would like to reserve my remaining time.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ON BEHALF CF THE RESPONDENT

MR. SCHEER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

1 the Court;

2

I think to start out, it is important to focus in

3 on what is really an issue in this particular case.
4 really very narrow issue in this case, and

It is a

that issue is

5 what remedies are available to a successful civil rights
6 litigant if

he is not asked for attorney’s fees at a time

7 prior to judgment.
8

In those cases where the civil rights litigant has

9 properly requested attorney's fees in his pleadings, or in
10 motion prior to entry of judgment,

a

that request is preserved

11 and can be addressed by the court.
12

QUESTION;

13 this statute?
14

What happens to a case filed before

Did they have to ask for attorney’s fees?

MR. SCHEER;

I believe that Congress provided that

15 the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of

1976 would

16 apply to cases pending at the time of the enactment of the
17 statute.
18

QUESTION;

19

MR. SCHEER;

20 under Rule

You mean that he should have amended?
That is correct, Your Honor, and

15 they have liberal rights to amend.

They could

21 have filed a motion for attorney’s fees at any time prior to
22 entry of the judgment.
23

In this case, --

24

QUESTION;

Kell suppose he does, though, have it

25 in his complaint, or he files a

motion and then there is

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 judgment.

Now, the ten-day time limit would never apply to

2 him , would it?
3

KB. SCHEERs

That is correct, because it would not

4 be a final judgment, Your Honor.

Because the if fees issue

5 has not been addressed by the district court, that judgment
6 would not be final.
7

QUESTIONS

And it would not be appealable unless

3 he certified it as appealable?
9

KR. SCHEER:

That is,

unless the district court

10 perhaps decided to certify under Rule 54(b) I think it is
11 that there are other important issues that desire a review
12 on appeal.
13

QUESTIONS

But you think he could always do that,

14 and still save the attorney's fees.
15

MR. SCHEERs

I believe that he could, Your Honor,

16 that is correct.
17

The point is that the application of Rule 59(e)

18 gives the prevailing civil rights litigant a second shot to
19 get attorney's fees after there has been judgment on the
20 underlying cause of action, where the prevailing plaintiff
21 has not yet made a request for attorney's fees.

Rule 59(e)

22 gives the prevailing litigant an additional ten days to make
23 that request.
24

Under the Federal Appellate Rules, Number 4,

that

25 will suspend the time of the running of the appeal until the
20

QUESTION;

Excuse me, may I interrupt?

What is

4 your view of what he should file within the ten-day period?
5 Should he file a fee petition, or should he file a motion to
6 amend the judgment to reserve the fee issue?
7

HR. SCHEER:

All he need file is a motion to amend

8 the judgment. That is all that Rule 59(e) requires.
9
10 petition?

QUESTION;

What if just filed a document that said Motio for

11 allowance of fees?
12

But what if he just filed a fee

Would that be enough?

MR. SCHEER:

I think that would he enough.

I

13 think the whole point is that -14

QUESTION;

15 the ten days.

And the judge does not act on it within

Then he would later on treat it as though it

16 were filed under 59(e)?
17

MR. SCHEER;

Is that it?
Well presumably, the judge could

18 treat it as though it was filed under Rule 59(e).

The

19 purpose of Rule 59(e) is to promote expeditious resolution
20 of matters before the court.

The court would presumably

21 schedule a hearing on the fees issue if the issue were
22 contested, and presumably, the court could schedule that
23 hearing fairly expeditiously.
24

QUESTION;

I thought that was when there was an

25 appeal involved.

MR. SCHEER:

In the White case, Your Honor,

20 although the motion was not filed -- in this case, although
21 the motion was not filed within ten days; it was filed four
22 and a half months later, the court did schedule a hearing
23 because the fees issue was contested.

If the issue is

24 contested, the court will schedule a hearing.

In fact, the

25 court almost always generally schedules a hearing on an

MR. SCHEER;

In other words, there

I would agree with counselor Larsen

19 that as to those costs, a rule of reason should be applied.
20 I mean,

the parties should not wait for an unusually long

21 period of time in
22

which to file it.

But the reason for that rule is because costs are

23 items that are routinely taxed;
24 involve

they generally do not

any major controversy, and as the statute provides,

25 the clerk of the court may

tax the costs.
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

Yes, but there can be disputes over

2 costs .
3

KB. SCHEERs

There can.

But there, however,

still

4 a significant difference between a cost, a routine cost, and
5 an attorney's fees award such as we have in this case.
6

The attorney's fees award can lead to substantial

7 additional liability on behalf of the losing party.

In this

8 case, at the district court level the attorney's fees award
9 was roughly an amount of $16,000.

That is an amount of

10 money that must be paid directly by the defendant.
11 to pay it out of his own pocket.

He’s got

It is an additional

12 liability that he does not have.
13

So, since there is —

14

QUESTION*

How is that differentiated from the

15 judgment itself, if you have money involved?

The defendant

16 always pay the judgment.
17

MR. SCHEER:

That is correct.

But what we are

18 saying is in the case, solely in the case where the
19 attorney's fees issue has not been awarded prior to entry of
20 judgment, it seeks to impose a new, unanticipated liability
21 on the defendant.
22

QUESTION;

How can you say it is unanticipated?

23

MR. SCHEER:

If the issue is not framed in the

24 pleadings, and if it is not raised prior to entry of
25 judgment, if it is not before the court, if the parties have

1 not resolved it, the issue is not in the case.
2

QUESTION

It’s not -- the amount is not known.

3

KR. SCKEEE:

4

What we are saying is that this is a case where

That is correct, Your Honor.

5 the litigant has never asked for the fees prior to entry of
6 final judgment.

If the final judgment is, presumably,

7 final, it terminates the litigation; it fixes the
8 obligations of the parties.

And if four months later

9 counsel for — if four months later the prevailing party can
10 come in and say by the way,

we would like to have cur

11 attorney's fees, that is a significant new liability for the
12 losing defendant, or the losing party.

The losing party has

13 a right to expect that the prior judgment that was entered
14 without reference to attorney's fees, fixed his liability
15 and that the case was over.
16

QUESTION;

But reasonable is -- of course, this

17 arose in a transition period.

But do you suppose there

18 really will be very many cases in the future where
19 defendants, state organizations, won't be aware of the fact
20 that somebody is going to ask for fees?
21 to me to be kind of theoretical.

I mean, that seems

The statute is plain on

22 its face, unless, of course, you have the ten-day rule.
23 if you run on that, then they will just have to be more
24 diligent in their pleadings.
25

MR. SCHEER;

But, Justice Stevens, I think that
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And

1 this case indicates that, for example, in the settlement
2 context the defendant may come to believe, after discussions
3 with other counsel, that there would be no request for costs.
4

QUESTION:

5 defendants.

Well, those are pretty naive

I've been in a lot of cases where there are

6 fees that you wait on until later on.
7

QUESTION:

Mr. Scheer, is there anything in the

8 legislative history that suggests that Congress intended the
9 fees not to fall under Rule 54 as costs?
10

MR. SCHEER:

Nothing specifically, Justice

11 O'Connor, but there is language I believe in the Senate
12 report that indicates that in passing the Act, the Congress
13 intended to bring the remedy under

1983 actions in line with

14 the remedies that were available under other civil rights
15 actions, and the language of the Senate report also
16 indicated that it did not intend to create any startling new
17 remedies.
18

I would suggest that if you were to construe a fee

19 as a cost, and thereby allow the fee award to be asserted
20 adversely any time after entry of final judgment, that would
21 indeed be a startling new remedy that the Congress did not
22 intend to create when it enacted the Attorney's Fees Award
23 Act of 1976.
24

QUESTION:

Well, your argument then turns almost

25 on a difference that attorney's fees as costs are different
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in kind, not just in degree from the Fairmont Creamery type
2 of case that the court long ago held was not barred from
3 being awarded by a federal court under the 11th Amendment
4 against a state.
5

ME. SCHEEBj

Correct, but there are basically two

6 bases for our position.

One is that indeed, fees are

7 substantially different from costs.

And Congress, by using

8 the language it did in the statute, did not intend to define
9 fees as costs.

You must look at the entire language of the

10 statutory at the discretionary aspect of the court award of
11 attorney's fees.
12

The other basis of our argument is that a fee

13 award, under U2 USC 1988, is intimately tied to the merits
14 of the underlying cause of action; that it is not a
15 collateral and independent matter, as suggested by the
16 petitioner in this case.
17

In support of that contention, he cites certain

18 cases that deal with what is known as the common fund
19 doctrine.-

In those cases, courts have held that when a

20 common fund is identified, the prevailing plaintiff, the
21 successful plaintiff, can receive an attorney's fee award
22 out of the common fund.

Those cases, however, do not bear

23 on this case.
24

In the common fund cases, once the fund is

25 identified, the losing party no longer has any interest in
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the award of attorney's fees out of the fund.

The award of

2 those fees is intended to spread, to distribute the fees
3 among the class of benefited, by the efforts of the
4 successful party.
5

In this case, quite to the contrary, you have a

6 situation where the attorney's fee award is directly against
7 the losing party.

He obviously has a direct compelling

8 interest in the amount of the fee award because he is going
9 to have to pay it out of his own pocket.
10

So those essentially are our two main arguments

11 with respect to why Rule 5h(d) cannot be applied to this
12 situation .
13

QUESTIONS

Kr. Scheer, would you make the same

14 argument if you ware faced with the question under the
15 Securities Act, and the Antitrust Act and the Packers and
16 Stockyards Act ana the Comm unications Act and the Railway
17 Labor Act, where also, Congress has referred in a variety cf
18 ways to the taxing of attorney's fees as costs?

Are you

19 saying that in none of these instances did Congress mean
20 what it said; that they would be taxed as costs?
21

HR. SCHEER;

I am not familiar with those

22 statutes, Your Honor, but I am familiar with the fact that
23 there are several statutes.

The Solicitor General's brief

24 to this Court filed in April said that there were around 16
25 statutes which have been passed by Congress relating to the

ORAL ARGUMENT CF MARC R. SCHEER, ESQ

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT - Continued

5

MR. SCHEERi

Mr Chief Justice, and may it please

6 the Court
7

An additional issue we would like to address is an

8 issue raised for the first time in the petitioner's reply
9 brief, and that is the applicability of Federal Rule of
10 Civil Procedure 54(c) to this case.

This issue was not

11 raised in the courts below, and the parties have net had an
12 opportunity to brief it.

If the Court desires, I would be

13 happy to state our position with respect to Rule 54(c).
14

Rule 54(c) relates to the power of the trial court

15 to include in a judgment all remedies to which a party, a
16 prevailing party would be entitled.

Put it is important to

17 note that Rule 54(c) is a directive to the court before
18 entry of final judgment.

Rule 54(c) cannot be raised at a

19time after the final judgment is entered.
20

Therefore, Rule 54(c) cannot have an application

21 to this case.

As we say, anytime that an alteration in the

22 final judgment is requested, it must be done pursuant to the
23 directive of Federal Rule of Procedure 59(e), within ten
24 days after entry of the judgment.
25

I also desire to inform the Court of a recent
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., g.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 decision of the New Hampshire Supreme Court dated November
2 20, 1981.

I wish to inform the Court that although it deals

3 with an issue similar to this issue, the New Hampshire
4 Supreme Court has not totally adopted the position that the
5 respondents have taken in this case.
6

The New Hampshire Supreme Court, in ruling on a

7 fees request made approximately two months after entry of
8 final judgment, allowed the prevailing plaintiffs to assert
9 the attorney's fees.
10

However, the New Hampshire Supreme Court did

11 notice in its decision — and incidentally, the name of the
12 case is Royer v. Benjamin Adams, Commissioner of New
13 Hampshire, Department of Employment Security.
14 reported in 121 New Hampshire.

It will be

The date, again, is November

HR. SCHEER:

18

QUESTION:

Not yet. Your Honor.
New Hampshire certainly adept whatever

19 rule it wishes .
20

HR. SCHEER:

And that is the point, Your Honor.

I

21 feel an obligation to tell the Court about this case, and
22 this case is also distinguishable from the White case which
23 is now under consideration.

The New Hampshire Supreme Court

24 noted that Mr. Poyer in his original pleadings requested
25 fees, and that preserved, under our analysis of 59(e), that
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 fee request would still be appropriate two months after

2 entry of judgment, because the judgment was not final as the
3 fees issue had not
4

been decided.

And as you indicate, Justice Rehnquist, New

5 Hampshire Supreme Court did specifically say that there is
6 no state law on point, and in the absence of any definitive
7 directive,
8

it would decide the case on the basis of the rule

of reason and decided that applying for fees two months

9 after entry of judgment was reasonable in the circumstances
10 of that
11

case.
Finally, the application of Rule 59(e) to

12 judgments in a case of this type has practical
13 results.

and desirable

As noted before, there have been many different

14 positions that have been taken

with respect to the

15 timeliness of a request for attorney's fees after final
16 judgment is entered.
17 to have a uniform

It is desirable, and it is practical,

rule which will require that attorney’s

18 fees requests be made no later than ten days after entry of
19 the final judgment.
20

QUESTIONS

And I gather, Mr. Scheer, all that the

21 prevailing party has to do, do I understand you to suggest,

The Joint Appendix relates that the
that the fees issue had been waived

23 during settlement negotiations.
24

There was an argument about it during

25 the settlement.

QUESTION;

The petitioners said that --

So you did know that they did want

12 counsel fees.

13

MR. SCHEER;

He were aware that they had it in

14 mind, but our knowledge was, our counsel's knowledge was,
15 that they had been

waived.

QUESTION;

Wasn't it first decided that each side

17 would pay its own counsel fees?
18

MR. SCHEER;

19

QUESTION;

Excuse me, Your Honor?
Wasn't there discussion that each side

20 would pay its own fees,

and that was discarded?

So it was a

21 subject of discussion.

SCHEER;

MR. SCHEER;

I would say no because it had been

But surprised based on the fact that we thought

3 that they had waived the fee request; that they were not
4 going to bring it up.
5

Surprised to that extent.

Rule 59(e) contrasts with the practical problems

6 that would arise from the approach suggested by the
7 petitioners.

There would be no uniform rule relating to the

8 request of attorney's fees in civil rights cases.

1 first circuit in fact touches on a potential unfairness, a
2 basic unfairness, to the liable party in settlement
3 context.

And that is, if one of the parties has an

4 intention to seek attorney's fees and if it has not
5 previously been raised, that intention should be disclosed
6 during the course of settlement negotiations.

If the

7 parties are unable to reach an agreement on attorney's fees
8 after an agreement on the merits has been reached, the
9 parties may preserve the issue in the dissent decree by
10 specifically reserving it for later court consideration, or
11 the prevailing party may petition the court within ten days
12 after entry of the consent decree.
13

This procedure provides a safety valve which

14 promotes the important policy of encouraging settlement of
15 litigation and it also provides a mechanism whereby the
16 attorney's fees issues, if it cannot be settled, can be
17 reserved for consideration at a later date.
18

I have no further argument.

I will be happy to

19 answer questions.
20

QUESTION:

I have one other question.

You may

21 have already completed your answer, but Justice O'Connor
22 called your attention to a number of statutes that make
23 reference to fees, costs including fees, or fees as a part
24 of the costs.
25

And in the particular statute before us, under

Dc

5 you give any meaning at all to those words in your analysis?

MR. SCHEEFi

QUESTION;

As part of the costs?
Yes.

Or do you say we just simply

8 ignore it?
9

MR. SCHEER:

the expenses, of litigation.

QUESTION;

11

The meaning that we give to it is, as
We don't --

In other words, it would have the same

12 meaning if the words were simply deleted.

As a matter of notice and with regard
Yes, Your Honor,

this does take care

in our view.
QUESTION;

Mr. Scheer, isn't the basic purpose of

12 a consent decree to resolve in favor of one party or another
13 party a lot of disputed issues, of which each party has
14 notice.

And some may be resolved in favor of one, some in

15 favor of the other.

But the consent decree is a package

16 which presumably brings an end to the litigation.

KR . LARSON;

18 all issues,

But not necessarily with regard to

and that particularly is true with regard to

19 fees when it comes to the simultaneous negotiation of fees
20 and

the relief on the merits because of the ethical

21 conflict. Nr.

22

Justice Pehnquist.

QUESTION;

Couldn't the consent decree have

23 reserved the question of fees?
24

NR. LARSON;

It could have, but on this record

25 fees were raised as an issue,

and then it was not further

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 discussed because of the ethical issue.

There was no need

2 to specifically reserve the fee issue in the consent
3 decree.
4

The respondents were fully on notice.
QUESTION:

How do you answer, Kr. Larson, Mr.

5 Scheer’s suggestion that they had reason to think that as a
6 consequence of the settlement, fees had been waived?
7

MR. LARSON;

I answer that by the findings of the

8 trial court, and I would specifically make reference, Mr.
9 Justice Brennan, to the bottom of page 68 of the record of
10 the Joint Appendix.

There are two questions.

11 with regard to the findings.

This is not

This is what the trial court

12 based its findings on with regard to the fee request.
13

There are two questions presented by the trial

14 court to respondent’s counsel.

"Let me ask a direct

15 question, and this cuts right to the heart of the issue.
16 Are you saying that you and brother Kelly, who represented
17 the petitioner, had an agreement that there wouldn’t be any
18 motion for fees?"
19

The first answer is a little bit evasive, and the

20 court comes back and says, "Did you work it out at that
21 time, whatever point it was?
22

QUESTION;

23

KR . LARSON:

24 Absolutely.
25

Answer:

No, we did not."

And you think that helps you?
That the fees were not waived?

They were not waived, Kr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

Well, not waived, but not dealt with in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the consent decree.
2

HR. LARSON:

Because of the simultaneous -- I

3 mean, in the two hearings before the trial court,
4 respondent's counsel admitted on both occasions that the
5 reason the fees were not further pursued was because of the
6 ethical considertations of holding the class action hostage
7 for an award of fees that would go to plaintiff’s counsel.
8 It was fully discussed.
9
10

I should also point out two other things.
QUESTION:

Hr. Larson, I’m surprised you read that

11 sentence rather than the one you omitted, because the one
12 you omitted indicates that they were astounded at the
13 thought that you would waive fees.

That seems to me a lot

14 more supportive to your position than the one you quoted.
15

MR. LARSON:

I believe that is, also, but I

16 believe the second answer also rather succinctly states that
17 the fee issue was not resolved during the negotiations.

And

18 indeed, it was reserved, going on to page 69 of the
19 transcript, because of the ethical consideration of the
20 simultaneous negotiation.
21

QUESTION:

But not reserved in the decree; it

22 simply wasn’t settled by the decree.
23

HR. LARSON:

It was not settled by the decree.

It

24 did not have to be reserved in the decree to the extent that
25 respondent's counsel were on notice that the fees would be

No, that would have been wrong.
Do you perceive anything unethical in

that is

7 correct. Your Honor.
8

QUESTION:

Counsel, under your view, of the case

With regard to a final judgment or

I don't understand.

QUESTION:

Let's suppose a judgment was obtained,

14 as indeed it was here,

but both parties assumed their

15 litigation was over.
16

MR. LARSON:

17

QUESTION:

Well, that certainly is net this case.
Now, can you change your mind later and

18 come back and ask for attorney’s fees?

MR. LARSON:

19

Under a rule of reasonableness,

which

20 is akin

to laches, the issue would be prejudice.

21 indeed,

there had been an express or even an implied waiver

22 of fees at some stage,

And if

that would be up to the trial court

23 to determine as a matter of fact whether there had been such
24 a
25

waiver and whether they were prejudiced.
On this record, of course, there was notice so

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 there was no prejudice, and indeed, the trial court found
2 that there had been no waiver of fees; that the issue had
3 been discussed and essentially reserved.
4

QUESTION;

Khen you say essentially reserved, it

5 certainly wasn't essentially reserved in a written document,
6 was it?
7

ME. LARSON;

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. LARSON;

It was not in a written document.
In the consent decree.
But again, respondents were cn

10 notice, the issue was raised, it was effectively deferred
11 until after court approval of the consent decree.
12

Several things that were said by the respondents I

13 would also like to rebut.

There was — it is their view

14 that fees are not costs; that fees can be excised from the
15-- Congress's chosen language can be excised from the Fees
16 Act .

That is contrary to a cardinal rule of statutory

17 construction that was most recently announced by the Chief
18 Justice in Reiter v Sonotone Corporation two years ago,
19 where the court applied, under Section 4 of the Clayton Act,
20 the cardinal rule of statutory construction, that all words
21 used by Congress must be given effect if at all possible.
22 And indeed, the court has done this in fees cases; did it
23 twice within the last several years in the Fees Act cases cf
24 New York Gaslight Club v Carey and also in Maine v Tibotoc.
