ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GELLERi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10 may it please tha Courts
11

This is a Freedom of Information Act case hare

12 on writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia
13 circuit.

The casa involves Exemption 6 of the Act, the

14 personal privacy exemption, which protects against
15 mandatory public disclosure of government documents that
16 meet two criteria.

First, tha document must satisfy the

17 so-called threshold test by qualifying as a personnel,
18 medical or similar file.

And second, if the threshold

19 test is satisfied, it must be shown that disclosure of
20 the document would constitute a clearly unwarranted
21 invasion of personal privacy.

This is tha so-called

22 balancing test of the exemption.
23

The question presented here involves the

24 proper interpretation of the phrase "similar files" in
25 the threshold test of Exemption 6.

And the facts may be

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 briefly stated.
2

In September 1979 the Washington Post

3 submitted an FOIA request to the State Department for
4 any documents indicating whether two Iranian officials,
5 Dr. Ali Behzadnia and Dr. Ibrahim Yazdi, were American
6 citizens.

The State Department denied the request on

7 the basis of Exemption 6.
8

After the Washington Post brought suit to

9 obtain the documents, the State Department submitted
10 affidavits from an Assistant Secretary of State saying
11 that in light of the social and political conditions
12 then existing in Iran, which were briefly described, any
13 confirmation or denial by the United States government
14 that either individual is a United States citizen would
15 be likely to cause a substantial threat of physical harm
16 to the individual.
17

The affidavits also listed several recent

18 examples of Iranians who had suffered serious harm
19 because their names had been linked to the United States
20 in official documents.
21

Despite these unrebutted affidavits, the

22 District Court ordered the State Department to comply
23 with the Post’s FOIA request, and the Court of Appeals
24 affirmed.
25

The D.C. Circuit held that the government had

1 failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of Exemption
2 6 by showing that the documents requested constituted
3 personnel, medical or similar files»

There's no

4 question that this was not a personnel or medical file.
5 The court said that to qualify as a similar file a
6 record must incorporate, and I quote, "intimate details
7 about an individual, information of the same magnitude
8 that is highly personal or as intimate in nature as that
9 at stake in personnel and medical records.”
10

The Court of Appeals concluded that the fact

11 of current United States citizenship was simply not an
12 intimate detail.

As a result, it ordered release of the

13 documents without reaching the balancing part of the
14 exemption; that is, without considering at all whether
15 in light of the State Department's unrebutted
16 evidentiary submission, disclosure of the documents
17 requested by the Washington Post would constitute a
18 clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of
19 the individuals named in the documents.
20

QUESTION:

If we should agree with you, ttr.

21 Geller, do we sent it back for consideration of that
22 element?

SR. GELLER;

I think it would be helpful to begin

2 discussion of this case by stating first exactly what is
3 and what isn't involved here, and then by stating
4 exactly what the opposing arguments of counsel are,
5 because I think that respondent's briefs have attempted
6 to obscure the relevant issue.
7

As I just said in response to Justice

8 Brennan's guastion, the question presented here is not
9 whether the documents requested by the Post can be
10 withheld from the public.

Even if this Court eventually

11 agrees with the government as to the correct meaning of
12 the threshold test of Exemption 6, there would still
13 have to be a remand.
14

QUESTIONs

I'm curious as to why you say there

15 would have to be a remand.

Is the balancing test

16 performed on the basis of a lot of facts that would be
17 have to be ascertained at a trial, or is it just the
18 judgment of the court before which the matter is pending
19 that on balance, you know, A wins or B wins?
20

MR. GELLER:

Well, the Court of Appeals didn't

21 reach the balancing test.

We believe that the balancing

22 test does require a weighing of facts.
23

Now, the facts were submitted to the District

24 Court and both sides moved for summary judgment, and I
25 assume that this Court could reach that question.

It

1 wasn't reached by the court below, and the respondents
2 have not suggested as an alternative ground for
3 affirmance that the documents must be disclosed under
4 the balancing test.

Neither side has briefed that issue.

5

Wall, what facts does the district

QUESTION;

6 court weigh?
7

NR. GELLER:

It weighs the public interest in

8 disclosure of the documents against the magnitude of the
9 harm, the magnitude of the invasion of privacy of the
10 particular individual involved or named in the
11 documents.
12

And that is often a fact specific inquiry.
As I say, here none of the facts were

13 disputed.

The State Department's affidavits were not

14 rebutted.

The Post moved for summary judgment, as did

15 the government, and the district court granted summary
16 judgment to the Washington Post.
17

Now, the issue before this Court then is

18 simply whether the government should be forced to
19 release these documents without having an opportunity to
20 show the Court of Appeals that disclosure would
21 constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
22 privacy.

In other words, the question here is what sort

23 of documents in government files that relate to specific
24 individuals did Congress intend to make eligible for
25 undergoing this balancing process.
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

WASHINGTON D C 90054 f909l SS4-934S

1

Now, it's the position of the government that

2 the threshold test of tha exemption was meant only to
3 screen out agency records that don't refer to any
4 specific individual.

If an agency document either

5 explicitly or by identifying characteristics does refer
6 to a particular person, then we believe that what
7 Congress clearly had in mind in enacting Exemption 6 was
8 that release of the document would be governed by
9 whathar public disclosure would constitute a clearly
10 unwarranted invasion of the person's privacy.
11

Sow, considerations such as the intimacy of

12 the particular facts involved, or the public nature of
13 the information, or the fact that the information sought
14 might happen to be located in court records somewhere or
15 in books that were published by someone are not
16 irrelevant.

We don’t say that those are irrelevant.

We

17 say that it be taken into account in the balancing part
18 of Exemption 6 rather than smuggled into the similar
19 files test.
20

QUESTION*

Doesn't it seem rather anomalous,

21 though, that information which is contained in
22 admittedly public records would be categorized as
23 information to which the balancing test might apply and
24 which could be withheld?
25

HR. GELLER:

I think it would be anomalous
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVF

RW

WASHINGTON nr OHHOA (OnO\ RRA-WA*

1

perhaps if information that was available to the public

2 could be withheld under Exemption 6, but that's not the
3 question here.

The question is simply can we make a

4 specific inquiry into the facts of a particular case
5 under the balancing test, or is any sort of inquiry into
6 the harm to the individual foreclosed totally by the
7 fact that there is a very, very narrow similar files
8 test that is imposed on federal agencies.
9

The Washington Post, on the other hand,

10 embraces the D.C. Circuit's view that a court is
11 precluded from engaging in any balancing unless the
12 information sought not only refers to an individual,
13 specific individual, but also is generically highly
14 intimate; in other words, unless it's the kind of
15 information that virtually everyone would like to keep
16 private about himself.
17

Sow, this case I think illustrates the

18 differences between the two approaches very, very well.
19 Most Americans, whether they're naturalized citizens or
20 were born here, would not consider citizenship to be an
21 intimate personal fact.

They'd freely disclose it.

22 is not an intimate detail.

It

But for current residents of

28 Iran, for example, possession of United States
24 citizenship might well be taken to indicate adherence to
25 a particular political philosophical view that's out of

3

QUESTIOSi

Out of favor where, back home?

4

MR, GELLER:

In Iran.

And disclosure of

5 American citizenship as to them might not only be
6 embarrassing but dangerous.

But the D.C. Circuit's

7 construction of similar files fails to take that at all
8 into account.

As long as some item is not considered by

9 the Court of Appeals to be an intimate detail,
10 generically intimate, then the courts and the agencies
11 are precluded from engaging in any balance.
12

How, perhaps this difference between the

13 Washington Post view of the threshold test and the
14 government's view can be put into even clearer
15 perspective by the following hypothetical.

Let's assume

16 that some foreign leader such as Idi Amin or Qadhafi
17 were to announce that he was going to kill every
18 American citizen in his country.

And let's also assume

19 that that leader, Quadhafi or Idi Amin or the Washington
20 Post, would then make an FOIA request to the State
21 Department listing 500 people who live in that country
22 and asking whether they're American citizens.
23

How, I don't think any of us would have any

24 trouble concluding that under those circumstances that's
25 not the sort of information that should be disclosed.

I think any court

It certainly doesn't come from the language

of the statute which doesn't use the phrase at all.

this case that citizenship information is not an

Ms thin* instead that what all personnel and

2 medical files almost by definition have in common is
3

that they contain facts about identifiable, specific

4

individuals, and it’s that characteristic that

5

distinguishes a similar file, in our view, and allows

6 the agency and the courts to then apply the balancing
7

test.
The D.C. Circuit's notion of intimate details
as the determinant of a similar file also doesn't come

10

from the legislative history of Exemption 6.

11

legislative history clearly shows is that Congress

12

wanted to protect vast amounts of information about

13

individuals that were stored in government files if

14

disclosure, as the House report put it, would harm the

15

individual.

What the

17

realization that it would be impractical to try to

18

what the solution was was to pick a broad similar files

threshold test so that no item that refers specifically

So

22 to an individual would be excluded from the exemption,
23

but to rely on the balancing test to screen out which

24

items of personal information should be withheld and

25

which items shouldn't be withheld from the public.

Both

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the House and the Senate reports plainly show that the
2 central pact of the exemption, the crucial part, was
3 intended to be the balancing test, not the threshold
4 test.

And this Court reached the same conclusion in the

5 Rose case.
6,

And the Court of Appeals' interpretation of

7 similar files leais to a number of anomalous results
8 that Congress couldn’t have intended.

For example,

9 under the D.C. Circuit’s approach, information that is
10 part of a government personnel or medical file could be
11 considered for withholding under the Exemption 6
12 balancing test regardless of whether it's generically
_

»

13 intimate because it meets the threshold test by being a
14 personnel or a medical file.

But the identical

15 information if it’s contained in a government file other
16 than a personnel or a medical file, it may be sitting
17 right beside the personnel or medical file, the exact
18 same information, it can’t be considered under the
19 balancing test unless it’s generically intimate, because
20 if it’s not generically intimate, it’s not a similar
21 file under their view.

And this goes, by the way, even

22 if it could be shown that disclosure of the information
23 would work a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
24 privacy.
25

And let me give the Court an example of what I
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

mean.

Let's assuis that one of the individuals involved

If he had, he would

file on him, and he surely would have been

6 asked on the form whether he was a United States
7 citizen, and somewhere in the State Department's
8

personnel files would be the answer to that question.
Sow, if the Washington Post had submitted the

9
10

request they submitted in this case, and if the State

11

Department had found that answer in its personnel file,

12

there's no question that it would have satisfied the

24 personal privacy.
25

Now, I’d like to end by making a point that I
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

alluded to earlier, but I think it's important enough to

2 repeat; ani that is that a broad reading of the term

3 "similar files” in Exemption 5 will not result in the
4 withholding of trivial or innocuous low privacy
5 information in government files.
Despite the impression that the Washington

6

7 Post and the newspaper amici have tried to create, the
8

government's interpretation of "similar files” here

9 would not result in wholesale nondisclosure of
10

information that should be made public.

11

12 earlier,

The Court should keep in mind, as I said
that even if something qualifies as a similar

13 file under a threshold test, a federal agency still
14 can't withhold the information unless the agency also
15 determines first if the information refers to a specific
16 individual; second, that disclosure of that information
17 would invade that individual's privacy; and third and
18 most important, that any such invasion of personal
19 privacy would be clearly unwarranted in view of the
20 public interest in disclosure.
21

That's a very, very difficult burden for a

22 federal agency to meet;

and any determinations it makes

23 in this area is of course judicially reviewable.

But in

24 contrast to the D.C. Circuit's test, at least disclosure
25 decisions under this approach would be made on the basis
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of rational criteria such as the possibility of harm to
2 the individuals involved and not on the basis of whether
3 the information happens to be in one file rather than
4 another, or whether someone might consider it to be
5 generically intimate.
6

Sow, what we ask. here is that we be given the

7 opportunity to show that the information related to
8 specific individuals requested by the Washington Post
9 would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
10 personal privacy before the State Department is forced
11 to release that information to the public.
12

If there are no further questions, I'd like to

13 reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. KENDALL, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MR. KENDALL*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19 please the Courts
20

I waited expectantly for my brother Geller to

21 tell the Court what District Court Judge Robinson found
22 in this case.

Since he didn’t do so, I’m going to have

23 to do so, because we come to this Court having won a
24 judgment in the district court and having sustained that
25 judgment on appeal.
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

flow, as the respondent in this Court, under

2 the settled precedents of this Court we can defend the
3 judgment of the Court of Appeals if there is any ground
4 on which it can be sustained.

And I want to make quite

5 clear at the outset we are defending that judgment not
6 only on the ground that the Court of Appeals was correct
7 in its similar files analysis, but also on the ground
8 that Judge Robinson’s balancing test was correct, even
9 though the Court of Appeals held that superarrogatory on
10 the facts of this case.
11

The government has consistently ignored what

12 the district court did, but I want to emphasize that its
13 conduct of the balancing test, which we submit was
14 correct, is an alternative ground on which we rely,
15 because if this Court were to reverse the opinion of the
16 Court of Appeals, it would have no effect on the outcome
17 of this litigation unless you also find that Judge
18 Robinson was wrong.
19

QUESTION*

Well, we could send it back to the

20 Court of Appeals, I take it, and tall them to review
21 Judge Robinson’s finding.
22

MR. KENDALL*

23 Rehnquist, you would have to find that Judge Robinson’s

We had printed a story saying

that Yazdi was — that the INS, which is in the Justice

Do you say the

6

HR. KENDALLs

Hr. Chief Justice, if that kind

7 of a requirement were announced by a foreign country as
8 a matter of policy, I think the government’s response
9 under the Freedom of Information Act would be an
10 executive order which would classify such information,
11 and then the government would be able to rely on
12 Exemption 1, the national security exemption.

So I

13 think that that would be the response in such a
14 hypothetical case.
15

QUESTION;

Well, then, are you saying that

16 tomorrow an executive order could be entered classifying
17 all information relating to these two gentlemen and that
18 would close the matter?
19

HR. KENDALLs

I ion’t think so, Hr. Chief

20 Justice, and that relates to the balancing test as it
21 was conducted in the district court.

One of the — and

22 I disagree that the Saunders affidavit was unrebutted.

Well, we wanted it as --

If it didn’t have any import, why

you want it?
MR. KENDALL;

We wanted it to make sure that

14 Yazdi was still an American citizen.

One of the ways

15 you can lose your citizenship is to renounce it at an
16 embassy abroad.

What happens then is then the consular

17 official will certify that fact and send a certificate
18 of loss of nationality back to the Justice Department.
19 That’s required by statute.

And then the Justice

20 Department sends it to the Court of

Naturalization.

So

21 we thought that this renunciation might have happened in
22 the interim.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Kendall, on page 20 of your

It makes it either endangering

11

Well, let's not talk about

18

20 public that would endanger the life or safety of

American citizens or foreign persons who had been here?
MR. KENDALL;

22

We think that is quite a

23

different question than the question of a privacy

24

interest.

25

our burden of showing that that information would not in

We believe that in the district court we met

2

QUESTION*

But there are many kinds -I was going to say I thought the

3 privacy issue was a second issue in this case.
4 we don't get to it.

Perhaps

The first issue is a similar test.

5

HR. KENDALL*

6

QUESTION;

That's correct.

But if you reach the privacy issue,

7 as you argue that we should, how do we dispose of that
8 particular argument?
9

MR. KENDALL*

Hell, I think that you do so in

10 light of the evidence of, in this record, a prior
11 Washington Post story citing an official government
12 agency stating that Yazdi was and remained a U.S.
13 citizen.
14

QUESTION*

But that's arguing that

15 republication would not endanger the individual.

The

16 point I'm making, if it would endanger the safety of an
17 individual, are you contending on the balancing test
18 that the information nevertheless should be released?
19

MR. KENDALL:

No.

On the balancing test if

20 the information were such that there was a legitimate
21 expectation of privacy, on the balancing test
22 endangerment would be one of the things weighed in that
23 balance.

We're contending here, however, that because

24 of the way the process of naturalization has been
25 established by Congress, because every part of that
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 process is held open to public scrutiny, because the
2 records of it are required by statute to be public that
3 there is no expectation of privacy, and that the Court
4 of Appeals was correct in holding on that basis that
5 these were not similar files; in other words, that the
6 threshold requirement of Exemption 6 was not met.
7

QUESTION;

Hell, where do you get the

8 expectation of privacy?

That sounds like Fourth

9 Amendment language.
10

!f R. KENDALL;

It's drawn from many cases.

The

11 Court here when it was construing Exemption 6 in Rose
12 talked of the implication of similar privacy values when
13 it was talking about the honor and ethics files of the
14 Air Force Academy.
15

The cases, though, the Court of Appeals cases

16 that we cite in our brief have made quite clear, I
17 think, that privacy expectations are critical in
18 determining whether something qualifies for Exemption 6,
19 because the —

4

QUESTION*

Well, I would think that a

5 personnel file, for example, has a great deal of
6 information that no' one would have much expectation of
7 privacy, if that's the proper test, because a typical
8 personnel file has a person's date of birth, date of
9 marriage, late of divorce sometimes, when you are sworn
10 in at the Army, when you're admitted to the bar -- a lot
11 of factors are facts of public record.

And yet no one

12 denies that a personnel file has to go through this
13 balancing test.
14

MR. KENDALL:

That's exactly right, but what

15 comes out at the end of the balancing test, of course,
16 according to this Court's construction of Exemption 6 in
17 Rose is that all of that information as to which there
18 is no expectation of privacy would be disclosed.
19

QUESTION*

Right.

20

MR. KENDALL*

21

QUESTION*

Couldn't be withheld.

But you have to defend here the

22 Court of Appeals* reasoning that you don't even get to
23 the balancing test because it's not a "similar file."
24

MR. KENDALL:

That's correct, but there the

25 Court of Appeals' reasoning reasoned that as to

the justem generis factor that you apply to get a hold

MR. KENDALL;

I think the best — it's hard to

23

give a description that is very concrete because so many

24

possible kinds of facts may be encompassed.

25

best test is that of this Court in Rose.

I think the

It asked of

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

these Air Force Academy disciplinary files are similar

2 facts or similar privacy values implicated.

The Court

3 also quoted the legislative history which indicated that
4

Congress had in mind intimate facts and personal details

5

about an individual.

6
7

The legislative history of Exemption 6 in both
the House and the Senate is similar in that it quotes

8 some kinds of files, and then it refers to in one house
9

intimate details, in the other highly personal facts.

10

And I think that's the best you can do as a threshold

11

definition.

12

the Court of Appeals was clearly correct in saying that

13

as to naturalization files, those simply do not

14

implicate the same kind of values, they don't relate to

15

a person's family, medical condition, drinking habits,

16

finances, religious practices and many other things.

17

They are generically public.

Well, I frankly don't follow your

suggestion that a naturalization file is all that

This book, "Mission To Iran," was published by

6

William Sullivan, our last ambassador to Iran who was

released last November, and in his book he says at page

8

200, which we quoted in our brief, "Ibrahim Yazdi, an

9

Iranian immigrant to the United States, lived many years

10

in Houston and acquired U.S. nationality."

11

Likewise, the other book, also published last

12

November, "Inside The Iranian Revolution," written by a

13

current State Department employee, director of the

14

Emergency Operations Center, had a similar statement

15

about Yazdi.

Sow, these books are not dispositive, but if

you're going to assume that a regime is so irrational to

visit harm on ons of its people because that person is

they would distinguish in a nicely discriminating

8 fashioa between books written by a former ambassador to
9

Iran and a current high State Department employee and

what we would print on the basis of State Department

So to answer your question, I can’t say for

certain, but we think that the government's claims of

MR. KENDALL:

Sr. Justice Marshall, I think

On that point, would that document

MR. KENDALL:

Yes, it would.

It's required by

1501 that the certificate of loss of

9 nationality be transmitted from the State Department to
10 the Justice Department.

The Justice Department

11 regulations we quote require that in the case of a
12 naturalized citizen to be transmitted back to the
13 Naturalization Court.
14

Now, the affidavit of our researcher, Paul

15 Wolfe, Paul deWolfe, which the government admits is

17 courts is invariably to put the loss of citizenship —

If there is in fact danger to a

8 man's life, it is conceivable that that might be done,
9 isn't it?
10

HR. KENDALL:

Well, I think, though, that

11 you'd only be addressing half the danger.

The danger to

12 the man's life would be the naturalization petition,
13 which has been granted.

Presumably it would not be the

14 renunciation petition.
15

QUESTION:

No, but it would prevent one from

16 finding out whether in fact he had renounced, because
17 conceivably he might have told someone wherever he is I
18 renounced my citizenship.
19 and maybe he isn't.

Maybe he’s telling the truth

But you want to find out whether it

20 would be if that weren't the case.

And I'm suggesting

21 that possibly he could have renounced, and it might not
22 be a matter of public record.

Maybe that's why you

17

SR. KENDALL:

But the protection that would be

18 required hare. Justice Stevens, under the governnmant's
19 own theory would not be a question of the renunciation
20 of citizenship protection.

It would be, and again,

21 under the Saunders affidavit itself, the fact Yazdi was
22 an American citizen.

And there is certainly nothing —

23 the statute affirmatively declares that that record will
24 be Kept public.

So under their theory, to protect Yazdi

25 what you need to do is get rid of the entire file, and

There is a prohibition

QUESTION:

Now, even the dates might be

4 terribly crucial here.

Suppose, for example, that one

5 of these men had renounced his citizenship by a letter
6 to the government, the Secretary of State or whomever,
7 in which he made a strong attack on the former regime of
8 the Shah and renounced his citizenship on that grounds.
9 That would make him a hero in Iran today.

On the other

10 hand, if he renounced — if he gained his citizenship
11 after the revolution, that wouldn't make him much of a
12 hero in Iran today, would it?
13

NR. KENDALL:

From what I know about the

14 Iranian situation, that is correct. Hr. Chief Justice.

How do you think, they

4

SR. KENDALL:

I have some difficulty knowing

5 what their position is, but I don't think it in fact
6 differs very much from ours.

As a definitional matter

7 it seems to me about the best you can do on the similar
8 files question is to say that something will qualify and
9 be treated as a similar file for purposes of possible
10 withholding under Exemption 6 if it implicates the same
11 kinds of personal privacy values -12

Hell, is that different from the

13 Court of Appeals said?

MR. KENDAILs

I believe that's correct

I

2 don't think that iefinitionally there is very much
3 disagreement, because if you look, at the language used,
4 whether the emphasis is on intimate or personal, the
5 thing that makes files potentially like medical or
6 personnel files is the intimacy or the personal detail
7 of those files.
8

The government has what is a very —

QUESTION:

Hell, do you think the government

9 is suggesting that if in any particular file there's
10 something that's embarrassing or dangerous or
11 "personal,” then automatically it's a similar file?
12

MR. KENDALL:

Exactly.

I think their

13 threshold requirement would be so expansive as to let
14 any fact, no matter how publicly known, be a matter of
15 withholding.

And I think that would completely destroy

16 the threshold requirement that Congress has enacted in
17 Exemption 6, and I think it would also distort the shape
18 of the FOIA in a very significant fashion.
19

This Court has always emphasized when it

20 reviewed the legislative history of FOIA that the
21 exemptions were made exclusive, that they were to be
22 construed narrowly, and it was the government's burden
23 to show that information qualified under a particular
24 exemption.

Given the government's theory, we would back

25 in the old days of Section 3 of the Administrative
39

Procedure Act which let a government agency withhold

2 information, any kind of information, simply for good
3 cause shown.

For all these reasons we believe that the

MR. GELLER:

Any — any document.
Any document in the government's

That was the point that I made in my

not much of a threshold determination then, I take it.

2

MR. SELLER;

3

QUESTION;

4

We don’t think — we think —
It really is an empty, almost an

empty gesture.

5

SR. GELLER;

I think — I think not, Justice

6

White.

There’s a lot of information in government files

7

that doesn’t refer to any individuals, and that would

8 not even pass the threshold test.
9

What Congress said, by the way, and what this

10

Court said in the Rose case is that the crucial test is

11

the balancing test, and that Congress did not intend

12

large amounts of information to be screened out from

13

even reaching the balancing test by the threshold test.

14

But that’s what the Washington Post's test would do.

15

I should point out that we're dealing here

16

with a class of information.

This Court's decision in

17

this case will only affect information that, a) does not

18

contain intimate details within the meaning of the D.C.

19

Circuit’s test, but, b) the government could show would

20

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal

21

privacy if it were released.

Because after all, if we

22 couldn’t even meet the balancing test, then regardless
23

of the decision in this case, the information would have

24

to be released, and it would be of only academic

25

importance whether it had to be released because it

20 question.

The Chief Justice asked whether the

21 Washington Post test in this case takes any account of
22 the fact that someone might be harmed by the release of
23 this personal information, and the answer I heard had
24 something to do with balancing, which I didn't
25 understand.

the upshot of the D

The question

2 Circuit's test which the Washington Post embraces in
3 this case is exactly that.

Tha fact that someone might

6 threshold test, and you never have to reach the
7 balancing test.
8

QUESTION!

I took his answer to mean that

9 that's the law and that's the end of it.

NR. SELLER;

The President could

But, counsel, did the district

1

QUESTION

All right.

And then if we sent it

2 back to the Court of Appeals, would it have to apply the
3 clearly erroneous standard?
4

HR. GELLER:

5 Justice O'Connor.

That is an interesting question,

I'm not sure that I've seen any case

6 law on what the standard is.

It is in a sense and in

7 some ways a factual determination, and perhaps the
8 clearly erroneous standard would apply.

But that is not

9 something that I have seen litigated.
10

QUESTION;

I don't see where even if you won

11 up here you'd gain anything.
12

HR. GELLERs

Well, we would gain the

13 opportunity to have an appellate resolution of the
14 question of whether the disclosure of this information
15 would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
16 privacy.
17

QUESTION;

And would you say that even a

18 congressional act that, for instance, required certain
19 employees to file certain public information statements
20 or reports would fall in the similar files category, so
21 that the court has to balance whether that ought to be
22 released to the public?
23

HR. GELLER;

If the government would withhold

24 that information, which is very likely -- we're only
25 talking hece

— obviously the government can release
47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the information under the FCIA.

t,

We’re talking about a

2 case that the government has decided not to release
3 because it believes it would constitute a clearly
i
4 unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
5

The fact that it relates to —

6

QUESTION;

But you would say technically it

7 was a similar file.
8

SR. GELLERs

We would say it’s a similar file,

9 and the fact that it is public or is required to be
10 filed publicly would be very, very weighty in terms of
11 how the balancing test should come out, and it would
12 almost certainly have to be disclosed.

But that’s a

13 separate question from saying that the government is not
'

14 even entitled to make its argument that it would be a
15 clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
16

Now, just one or two more things, if I may.

17 Justice Powell asked a question about whether harm is
18 something the Congress was concerned about, physical
19 harm, when it passed Exemption 6.

And the answer that I

20 heard is that the legislative history is clear that
21 Congress didn't mean to include that.
22

And I would refer the Court to the House

23 report which is quoted at page 19 of the government’s
CM

V

brief in which the House says that, "The limitation.

25 Exemption 6, provides a balance between protection of
/

48

1

the right to privacy and the preservation of the

2 public's right to government information by excluding
3

those kinds of files, the disclosure of which might harm

4

the individual."

5

legislative history is clear.

6

So we agree with Mr. Kendall that the

And just finally in response to Justice

7

Stevens' guestion, the regulations do provide that when

8

an American citizen expatriates himself that the State

9

Department is to send the record to the INS, which is to

10

send the record to the Naturalization Court.

11

Kendall said, there's nothing in the regulation that

12

prohibits keeping that information secret when it's

13

filed; but there is another answer as well, and that is

14

that the regulation doesn’t provide any time limit

15

within which the State Department has to forward the

16

information to the INS or the INS has to forward the

17

information to the Naturalization Court.

As Mr.

18

So it might well be -- we don’t know whether

19

the INS in fact gave the information to the Washington

20 Post that they suggest — but it might well be that the
21

INS was totally unaware if in fact Mr. Yazdi had

22 expatriated himself, if in fact he was a citizen to
23

begin with.
