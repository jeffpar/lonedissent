Mr. Jones, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court;
9

The issue in this case is whether, under standard

10 Atomic Commission management contracts, three private
11 contractors received and disbursed funds of the United
12 States as agents of the federal government and are,
13 therefore, constitutionally immune from New Mexico's gross
14 receipts and compensating use taxes.
15

Each of the contractors is a party to a management

16 contract with the Department of Energy, a form of contract
17 developed by its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.
18

The United States filed this action in the United

19 States District Court for the District of New Mexico,
20 seeking declaratory judgment that sales of tangible personal
21 property to the Department of Energy through the management
22 contractors was a sale to the United States and therefore
23 exempt from the New Mexico gross receipts and compensating
24 taxes.
25

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Jones, you said this is
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 a standard form of contract developed by the predecessor of
2 FERC?
3

MR. JOSES:

Yes.

The management contract concept,

4 I suppose it could be called, was developed by the Atomic
5 Energy Commission shortly after the World War II, and -6

QUESTION:

And I gather everything that it uses is

7 supplied by the government, isn't it?

All the funds it

8 spends and everything else is supplied by the government.
9
10

MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Do they make a profit under these

11 contracts?
12

MR. JONES:

Well, Sandia, one of the contractors,

13 makes no profit, receives no fee and does no other work,
14 other than the work it does for the government.
15

Zia and LACI, the two other contractors in this

16 case, receive a management fee.
17

QUESTION:

18

MR. JONES:

In addition, --

Is that substantial?
I guess it's relative.

If you compare

19 it to the amount of money they spend, it's not substantial,
20 it's a small percentage.

I'm not sure of the fee that Zia

21 received, but it's not -- in the mid-seventies I think it
22 was not more than $50,000.
23

QUESTION:

What is it, the government does this

24 sort of thing just to get the management know-how of these
25 companies?

Is that it?
4

1

MR. JONES;

That’s the primary reason.

It really

2 started —
3

QUESTION;

4

MR. JONES:

Rather than do the job itself.
That's right.

It would be very

5 difficult, I imagine, for the government to do the job
6 because they'd have to hire all of these people who have
7 expertise in particular areas who might well be working for
8 private companies in different areas using that expertise.
9 And very early on -- I think this is primarily historical.
10

The Manhattan Engineer District, which is

11 resposible for the development of the atomic bomb in World
12 War II, decided that the quickest and most efficient way of
13 getting the manpower and the knowledge and the know-how for
14 the development of the atomic bomb was to draw on the
15 resources of private industry.

And Congress after World War

16 II when it created the Atomic Energy Commission and gave it
17 statutory authority to control the development of atomic
18 energy, it specifically indicated that the Commission should
19 be permitted to, or the Commission could continue this
20 policy of drawing on or relying on private contractors for
21 the carrying out of its functions.
22

And although the Atomic Energy Commission replaced

23 the Manhattan Engineers District in 1947 and then was in
24 turn replaced by the Energy Research and Development
25 Administration in, I guess, 1975, and then ERDA, the Energy

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 Research and Development Administration# was replaced by the
2 Department of Energy in 1977, they have all continued to use
3 these same kinds of management contracts for the purpose of
4 carrying out their responsibilities.
5

The United States filed this action seeking a

6 declaratory judgment that sales to the management
7 contractors were sales to its agents# and therefore, to the
8 United States.

And as a result, immune or exempt from New

9 Mexico gross receipts tax.
10

The United States also sought declaratory judgment

11 that the funds disbursed by these three contractors were not
12 subject to either the New Mexico gross receipts tax or the
13 compensating tax.
14

On cross motions for summary judgment, the

15 district court held that the management contractors were, in
16 fact, agents, and that the sales of personal property to
17 them were exempt from both the gross receipts and
18 compensating taxes, and that the disbursements by the
19 contractors were also exempt from such taxes.
20

The Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that the

21 managemewnt contractors were not agents and consequently
22 subject to such taxes.

The court of appeals explained its

23 decision by saying our reiterated antipathy to wholesale
24 deprivations of state treasuries without congressional
25 action requires at the least some special arrangement before
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 tax immunity attaches.
2

The relevance of the court of appeals' hostility

3 to federal immunity or deprivations of state treasuries
4 would be dubious in almost any case.

And I will attempt to

5 show, that the court’s stated antipathy is misdirected is
6 misdirected in this case.
7

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Jones, are you going to

8 elaborate on your footnote on page 27 of your brief of the
9 Carson-Poane and then repeal of 9(b) and then
10 Kern-Limerick?

Because certainly. Congress itself was not

11 entirely happy with the Carson-Poane decision, I take it.
12

MR. JONES;

But, Justice Rehnguist, there's a

13 substantial difference between saying that the -- everyone
14 or all of the contractors with the Atomic Energy Commission
15 are completely immune from state taxation and saying that
16 the contractor shall be immune to the extent that all other
17 contracts with the federal government would be immune.

And

18 Congress clearly recognized the distinction because they
19 made it clear that all they were doing was repealing the
20 decision that this Court had interpreted as creating a
21 statutory immunity.
22

And I’m not sure what further elaboration on that

23 point you were seeking.
24

QUESTION;

In other words, the government concedes

25 that these contractors are on the same footing as any other
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sort of government contractors; they don't occupy any
2 special status by virtue of the earlier legislation that was
3 passed in the forties.
4

MR. JONES;

We concede only that there's no

5 statutory immunity, such as Section 9(b), but it is not our
6 position that these contractors are like any other
7 contractors.

I mean, their immunity from taxation is

8 determined in the same way that any other private
9 contractor's immunity would be determined, but the nature of
10 their relationship with the Atomic Energy Commission we
11 think is very different from that of many other private
12 contractors.
13

QUESTION;

Mr. Jones, is it the position of the

14 government that it is immune from the state tax insofar as
15 it relates to the payments by these contractors for the
16 services of its employees?
17

NR. JONES;

Yes.

It's the position of the

18 government that the disbursements -19

QUESTION;

20

NR. JONES;

As well as the goods that are purchased.
That's right.

In our view, there is

21 no distinction, no reasonable distinction, to be drawn
22 between the disbursements by these contractors of funds for
23 the payment of services and their disbursement of funds for
24 the payment of goods, because in both cases, the contractors
25 are acting on behalf of the United States.

They have no

QUESTION;

Well, it is -- it certainly is true,

4 though, that making the employees technically employees of
5 Sandia rather than the government distinguishes them in very
6 substantial ways from other employees of the government.
7 They aren't civil service people, they aren't subject to the

Sure.

11 those purposes -12

1 District needed to mobilize a great deal of knowledge and
2 resources and energy in a very short time and do it
3 secretly, and they decided that the best way to do it was to

5 resources of private contractors.

And they would hire — they would have

MR. JONES:

I'm not sure that that's what occurred

I know, but Mr. Jones, these employees,

12 do they not, have the protections, for example, of the Fair
13 Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the
14 Davis-Bacon Acts and all the rest of them, don't they?

QUESTION*

Mr. Jones, in that regard, I take it

13 you agree with New Mexico that there are over 10,000 other
14 contracts around the country using advanced funding

16 apparently purchasing agents of the government.

18 position.

MR. JONES*

I don't think that’s Mexico's

I think they say that there are 10,000 other

19 letter of credit arrangements.
20 out, most of

Most of those, as we point

those letter of credit arrangements are grants

21 to private individuals and not contractors.
22

So in our view, the fact that there are these

23 letters of credit available and used by other agencies in
24 other contexts for other purposes has no bearing at all on
25 whether the use of letters of credit by contractors to
12

1 purchase property, title to which passes directly to the
2 United States -3

QUESTION;

Well, does the record show us how many

4 comparable advanced funding arrangements there are in
5 existence that the government has?
6

KB. JONES;

Comparable to these?

Well, I am not sure the record

7 indicates anything specific about the nature of the other
8 contracts.

If you look at the attachments to the deposition

9 of Kr. McGrath, you will see that they are — that the
10 letters of credit are to institutions that are not doing
11 work for the government.

There are about 40 or so attached,

12 and they are all to -- most of them are to grantees.

There

13 is one from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
14 -- it's not that anymore, it's Health and Human Services now
15 -- to a professional review board.

But it's not clear what

16 the nature of the relationship between that organization and
17 HAS is.

So it's not even clear that the one example they

18 point to is comparable to the contracts here.
19

Our impression, however, is that the type of

20 relationship that exists between the management contractors
21 and the Atomic Energy Commission here is virtually unique.
22 There may be other contracts in which various aspects of the
23 relationship are duplicated.

But as far as we know, there's

24 no substantial number of government contracts in which you
25 have the unique combination of elements of a contract that
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 exist between the management contractors and Department of
2 Energy.
3

QUESTION;

When you say unique, you don't mean

4 because they're Atomic Energy contractors, but because of
5 the nature of the relationship.
6

NR. JONES;

That's right, the relationship created

7 by the contract is relatively unique.
8

None of these contractors spend any money under

9 the contract.
10

QUESTION;

11

NR. JONES;

12

QUESTION;

You mean of their own.
Of their own.
Of course, these people aren't doing

13 this out of pure altruism, as indicated by the fact of -- is
14 it Sandia that gets licenses on any of the developments in
15 the laboratory work?
16

NR. JONES;

17 however.

We don't suggest that they're doing it because of

18 altruism.

Well, they give as much as they get,

As the state points out in some detail, there are

19 benefits to the private contractors.

I mean, the knowledge

20 and experience that's developed in these areas.
21

The dissenting opinion in Livingston points out in

22 great detail that these contractors receive a large number
23 of benefits from the government or in the course of their
24 work.

That does not change the nature of their relationship

25 to the government, however.

the federal government and its instrumentalities are

HR. JONES:

Yes.

County of Fresno involved the

question of the state's power to tax an employee of the

government's interest, beneficial interest or beneficial use

5

of government-owned property.
Here, New Mexico hasn't purported to tax the

contractor's interest in or use of the government’s

8 property.
9

They have tried to impose a tax or interpreted

their gross receipts tax to apply to money that the

have no interest in and no use of.

They are

simply acting as agents for, disbursing agents, for the

but as this Court's decision in

13 Kern-Limerick makes clear, the fact that the government
14 could have accomplished its goals in different ways by
15 adopting a different contract than the one it did, does not
16 indicate or nullify the effectiveness of the contract that
17 it did adopt.

And it's our position that the relationship

18 here including the advanced funding for the purchase of
19 goods for the United States and services for the United
20 States indicates an agency relationship, at least as clearly
21 as the relationship indicated in Kern-Limerick.

MR. JONES;

The tax is simply to collect the gross receipts tax

QUESTION;

But in the end in both situations, the

2 United States government pays the tax.
3

MR. JONES;

Oh, that’s for sure.

But the holding

4 in Boyd is simply that the contractor's beneficial use of
5 the property of the government was a taxable interest.
6

QUESTION;

Does all of this depend on precisely

7 the way that the state legislature writes the tax?
8

MR. JONES;

Well, I don't know, precisely the way

9 the state legislature writes a tax.

But it does depend on

10 the nature of the interest that the state purports to tax.
11

For example, this Court last term affirmed the

12 decision of the Tenth Circuit in a case, United States v.
13 State of Colorado precisely because the state of Colorado
14 purported to tax the use by a management contractor of a
15 facility, a government-owned facility, on its full value to
16 the contractor.

And the Tenth Circuit held in that case

17 that there was no meaningful use that the state could tax to
18 the contractor.

If there are no further questions I'd like to

20 reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

I*d like to begin by responding to Justice

1

2 Stevens'

question because I think that question hit the nail

3 on the head.

The only thing that is different, if anything

4 is different, about these contractors compared to the
5 contractors in the Kern-Limerick case or King & Boozer is
6 that they get their

7 fact.

money up front instead of after the

When you read particularly the reply brief of the

8 United States,

it is clear that that is all that they are

9 saying.
10

Now, the benchmark I believe that would assist in

11 analyzing the contractors today is the Boyd case,
12

that this Court considered.

the case

It is true that there a use tax

13 was being considered rather than a gross receipts tax.

But

14 principles were enunciated in that case which indicate that
15 this Court has already scrutinized standard management
16 contractors and said that the mere fact that they contract
17 with the United States, the fact that they operate in a
18 government facility, use advance funds, have a complete
19 absence of risk as a result of advanced funding, undertake
20 important federal duties, have the title to their purchases
21 passed to the United

States, that all of this is simply

22 symptomatic of government contracting.

It does not create

23 agents, it does not create instrumentalities.
24

An important concession found at page 201 of the

25 Appendix is the concession by the United States, which I
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 think is proper following the Boyd decision# that these
2 contractors are not instrumentalities.

Now, I'm never sure

3 what an instrumentality is, but in some way I read that to
4 mean that the mere fact of a contractual association is not
5 enough to make you an agent.

Advanced funding was used from

6 the beginning of the Atomic Energy Commission, it was used
7 at the time this Court decided Roane-Anderson, it is
8 continued to be used after Congress legislatively reversed
9 the Roane-Anderson case.
10

The United States is simply selecting one

11 contractual element of the relationship and after the fact
12 reading in great significance.

There is really no

13 difference, as shown by the history of advance funding
14 within the Atomic Energy Commission.
15

We have cited in our brief and in the transcript

16 the fact that the Atomic Energy Commission has always viewed
17 these contractors as cost plus contractors.

This Court in

18 Boyd called them cost plus contractors, even though they
19 were getting advanced funding.
20

QUESTIONi

Well, there's no plus in the Sandia

21 case.
22

MR. FREIDMANj

No, that is correct, Justice White,

23 and in the fourth part of our brief we discuss at some
24 length the benefits that accure to Sandia.

I believe

25 Justice Brennan pointed out licenses, payments effectively

which the interrogatory was responded to.

QUESTION;

Those license might produce very

4 valuable results for Sandia, might they not?
5

MR. FREIDMAN;

6 and

They might, indeed, Justice Burger,

basically, it's important to remember, I believe, that

7 Sandia, although it was created to undertake these
8 contracts,

was created, if you'll pardon the colloquial

9 expression, by the telephone company.
10 if
11

Sometimes I feel as

the telephone company is the government of the United

States, but that is only in jest.

12

Route 128 around Boston, Silicone Valley in San

13 Francisco, is surrounded by companies that are created to
14 work for the government, that only exist to work for the
15 government.

The real comparison, I believe, is with the

16 corporations that the United States did set up in World War
17 II to build ships, to build munitions.

There were reasons

18 why the United States has chosen to go the private route.
19

And as Justice Brennan asked about G0GC0 plants,

20 government owned,

contractor operated, I believe the

21 Michigan property cases are decisions by this Court
22 recognizing

that even though you are working in a government

23 facility, using government property, you're still subject to
24 taxes.
25

I think what the United States confuses in looking

Apparently not.

And an example

give you is in the Boyd case, after the

And I've cited in my brief from the pleadings in
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that case indicating that it was the contractor who paid the
2 tax, but he paid it with advance funding.
3

The important point I believe from that

4 illustration is that it was the contractor's obligation to
5 pay the tax; he was the one that was liable.

And turning to

6 a question that was asked, similarly with the employees.
7 And remember there are 7000 employees of these contractors,
8 only 160 of whom are involved in procurement, meaning
9 transactions with third parties.
10

Fifty-eight percent of all these contractors'

11 receipts are not in that classic agent relationship of
12 dealing with third parties; 58% are simply to meet the
13 payroll.

And we are in a situation in which the United

14 States has conceded they are not instrumentalities; we are
15 not liable for their torts, we don't want to be involved in
16 their labor relations; we conceived that the contractors are
17 independent contractors in hiring and supervising these
18 employees, and yet when the taxman comes calling, suddenly
19 as the reply brief says, they are simply independent
20 contractors working for a fee for the Zia Company or for
21 Sandia.
22

This to me strains the concept of employee

23 greatly.

The United States has made so many concessions in

24 this case about its relationship vis a vis the contractors'
25 employees that there is no way of finding that the
26

1 contractors'
2 contractual

3

7000 employees in some way have a direct
relationship with the United States.

True, advanced funding is used to meet the

4 payroll, but the question is, is it the United States'
5 obligation to pay those employees or is it the contractor's?
6

I think the distinction has to be that under these

7 contracts, as under any cost plus contract, it is the United
8

States that has an obligation to Sandia, Zia and LACI to pay

9 them .
10

QUESTION:

Do you think -- you don't think that an

11

employee or a vendor of goods to the contractor could ever

12

sue the United States?

13

MR. FREIDMAN;

Your Honor, in the deposition of

Yes, that is correct.

QUESTION:

24 about suing the United States in the Court of Claims?

MR. FREIDMAN:

2 and

frankly, --

3

QUESTION:

What does that mean?

That he could or

4 could not sue in the Court of Claims?

MR. FREIDMAN:

5

I don't know the answer to that,

6 sir .

QUESTION:

7

Well, if the United States is an

8 obligor, why couldn’t he sue them?

QUESTION:

9

I would think he could.

But I thought

10 your message to us was that the only obligation that's owed
11

to any third parties is the contractor's obligation.
MR. FREIDMAN:

QUESTION:

Perhaps we can find out what the United

2 States’ position is on that shortly.
3

ME. FREIDMAN:

At page 120 of the Appendix, there

4 is a clear distinction drawn between the Zia Company as the
5 buyer.

It is defined in the purchase documents as the

6 buyer, and indeed, the government in its reply brief
7 concedes# they call it the nominal buyer, I say it's the
8 buyer and that's what the purchase -9

QUESTION:

You say whatever authority the

10 contractor has in this case, it is your position I take it,
11 that it has no authority to obligate the United States.
12

MR. FREIDMAN:

It has no authority any different

13 from that of any other cost plus contractor.

I do not

14 understand them to have that.
15

As I indicate, by the concessions in this case,

16 there is no direct claim between the contractors' employees
17 and the United States, so that is one segment of these
18 receipts.

In dealing with third parties, the contractors

19 are required to order in their own names.

The purchase

20 documents indicate that the purchase orders could be
21 assigned to the United States, which to me indicates that
22 they are not parties to that purchase, but discovery reveals
23 that they never are assigned.

I suppose if -- well, never mind.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FREIDMAN:

In other jurisdictions, as

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 discussed in our brief I believe in the footnote at page 16,
2 the Atomic Energy Commission deliberately structured
3 transactions in a totally different way from these
4 transactions.

It had the purchase orders assigned to it, it

5 made payments directly to the vendors.

It was done

6 deliberately to avoid taxes.
7

The fact that those procedures have been viewed by

8 the Atomic Energy Commission as a means of avoiding state
9 taxes strongly suggests that the mere contractual interplay
10 that is at issue here does not amount to the same
11 relationship.
12

QUESTION;

Help me again.

I thought the district

13 court in this case found that the relationship insofar as
14 purchasing was concerned made these three companies
15 purchasing agents of the United States, which would seem to
16 me to mean they had the authority to obligate the United
17 States.
18

MR. FREIDMAN;

Justice Stevens, this was done on

19 cross motions for summary judgment.

The district court did

20 find that the contractor was an agent in all respects, based
21 on the contract documents and exhibits, none of which was
22 controverted.
23

The Tenth Circuit reversed.

QUESTION;

The Tenth Circuit reversed saying even

24 if that's true we would reverse.
25

MR. FREIDMAN;

But also, the Tenth Circuit said
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that given all the concessions in regard to the relationship
2 with the contractor's employees, given the fact that the
3 contractors were contractually required to order in their
4 own name, contractually required to use purchase forms that
5 said Zia is the buyer, not the United States, militated the
6 conclusion that the contractors were the only parties that
7 were obligated to the vendors.
8

I agree that it is easier to find agency in the

9 relationship with third parties.
10 use of an agent.

That is the classic agent

And therefore, also, that the relationship

11 with the employees is far more clearly a non-agent
12 relationship, particularly given the concession that these
13 contractors are not instrumentalities.
14

QUESTION:

If one of these contractors buys from a

15 third party and he is required to order in his own name,
16 that's perfectly true.

But upon delivery, the United States

17 owns the property.
18

ME. FREIDKAN:

19

QUESTION:

It does, Justice White, but --

And I suppose there have probably been

20 weaker claims of contract with the United States that have
21 prevailed in the court of claims than this one.
22

MR. FREIDMAN:

Justice White, the United States

23 has advanced no claims in this case in the record or
24 elsewhere; they have purely argued that advanced funding
25 equal the relationship.

They have not brought in examples
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of litigation in the Court of Claims.
2

But the Boyd contractor in the Boyd case also

3 involving these same Atomic Energy Commission contractors,
4 title to the purchase is passed to the United States.

That

5 was true in the Kern-Limerick case, it was true in the
6 Alabama v. King £ Boozer case.
7

I believe that what this Court has consistently

8 said is that the mere fact that title is passed, and the
9 mere fact that contractors in some loose and general sense
10 are operating for the government, or acting as agents for
11 the government -- and this is from the Alabama v. King £
12 Boozer case — does not amount to an agency relationship.
13

QUESTIONi

Your submission I suppose is if the

14 United States wants a tax immunity, it ought to either have
15 what might be called an instrumentality or they just ought
16 to do it with their own employees.
17

HR. FREIDMAN;

That is correct, Justice White, and

18 I believe that that is what was said in the opinion in
19 Boyd.

That

the government knows how to make agents, it

20 knows how to use its own employees; if it wants to, let it
21 go ahead.
22 with here.

That is the same contractors as we are dealing
Yet, it is only two years into the case, and I*m

23 a trial lawyer.
24

In a contract case, if somebody starts changing

25 his contracts in the middle of the case, I start thinking
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 maybe he had a weak case.

And even these contract

2 modifications are still reluctant to come out and say flat
3 out, I am designating you as an agent.
4

Our brief in the first section discusses at great

5 length documentation of the Atomic Energy Commission's
6 reluctance, its fear about designating its contractors as
7 agents, its fear that they will become enmeshed in exactly
8 the sort of red tape that leads the government in the first
9 place to use private companies.
10

Obviously, the government has, on other occasions,

11 created instrumentalities, on other occasions it has created
12 corporations.

Yet that is not the thrust of federal

13 contracting.
14

QUESTION;

Mr. Friedman, what about the first

15 question in the Boyd case that was not appealed?

Isn't it

16 correct that the Tennessee court held that the contractor
17 was a purchasing agent and therefore was immune from the
18 sales tax?
19

MR. FREIDMAN;

20

QUESTION:

That is correct. Justice Stevens.

If that is still good law, why doesn't

21 that apply here?
22

MR. FREIDMAN:

Because of the factual difference

23 between this case and that one.

There, the Atomic Energy

24 Commission, following Roane-Anderson, had gone back and
25 rewritten its purchase documents to say nothing herein shall
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 preclude direct liability of the United States to the third
2 parties.

So there is an excellent example of the Atomic

3 Energy Commission taking the standard contract form which is
4 supposed to have such magic and putting in much stronger
5 language in order to make sure that that happened.
6

QUESTIONi

Do you say that the legal issue here is

7 -- the bottom line is whether the United States had a direct
8 obligation to the vendor?
9

MR. FREIDMAN:

That's really what we have to -Yes, and certainly in regard to the

10 employees, Justice Stevens.

It is unlike the Kern-Limerick

11 case, unlike the Boyd case.
12

QUESTION;

I don't understand what you mean by

13 with regard to the employees.

They don't have

14 responsibility for labor negotiations and all that.

I

15 understand that.
16

MR. FREIDMAN;

Yes.

I'm saying that unlike other

17 cases, the Kern-Limerick case purely involved a relationship
18 between a contractor and a third party supplier.

In this

19 case, 42% of the receipts relate to that sort of
20 transaction? 58% of the receipts are simply meeting the
21 internal payroll of Sandia, Zia and LACI.

And again, as to

22 those relationships, the government has disclaimed a direct
23 relationship with the contractors' employees.
24

The United States in its reply brief I think gives

25 a strained interpretation.

If the government says, in

Mr. Friedman, the gross receipts tax is

Is it also measured by his

MR. FREIDMANi

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

Or is it how much -- or is the tax

9 collected by the vendors?
10

MR. FREIDMAN;

At page 25 of the U.S.'s brief, it

11

is conceded that absent the finding of an agency

12

relationship, the legal incidence of this tax is on the

13 contractor, not on the United States.
14

QUESTIONi

I know that.

But just mechanically, is

15 it the vendor who pays the tax and then adds it to the bill?

MR. FREIDMANi

No.

The contractor pays the tax

17 based on what he has received from the United States.

In

18 transactions in which there is also dealing with a second
19 party in the chain, there is a system of non-taxable
20 transactions.

MR. FREIDMAN;

So there are two gross receipts on —
No, I'm sorry, I appreciate the

4 correction, and let me explain it.
5

I 'm saying -- there are non-taxable transaction

6 certificates made available to insulate one of those levels

Perhaps that —

MR. FREIDMAN;

Because he will have given a resale

That is still -- in New Mexico we have already

12 litigated against White Sands Missile Range contractors, Air
13 Force contractors, various civilian agency contractors.

We

14 are negotiating with them to work out precisely those
15 transactions so that we can give them the non-taxable
16 certificates.
17

QUESTION;

I take it that Sandia occupies quite a

18 bit of property around Albuquerque, and all of that property
19 is tax exempt.
20

MR. FREIDMAN;

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.

21

I think underlying the Court's concern in this

22 area is the need to strike a balance between the needs of
23 the states for revenue and the need to protect the United
24 States from affronts to its supremacy.

I think what

25 distinguishes this type of case from the type of case in
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 which there really is an attempt to tax the United States is
2 that here the affront is, in effect, self-created by the
3 United States.
4

If the tax burden is too onerous, that is for

5 Congress to adjust, if the amount is too great.
6 Court has said in other recent cases.

As this

But we are dealing

7 here with contract drafting by a federal contracting officer
8 designed to assure that there will be an affront to the
9 supremacy of the United States.

And because of the

10 relationship between the Kern-Limerick case and the
11 underlying James v. Dravo case, which established the
12 general rule that federal contractors are liable for state
13 taxes, the arbiter of this balance between the state's needs
14 and the federal interests lies in the hands of individual
15 contracting officers.
16

QUESTION*

Mr. Friedman, do you think that for you

17 to prevail, Kern-Limerick has to be overruled?
18

MR. FREIDMANs

Absolutely not. Justice White.

19 Because —
20

QUESTION*

Anymore than Boyd had to overrule it,

21 is that it?
22

MR. FREIDMAN*

Exactly, that is right.

There is

23 no need to -- we rely on Boyd, and the difference between
24 this case and the Kern-Limerick case is that Kern-Limerick
25 dealt exclusively with transactions with third parties;
38

58% relate to employment relationships —

QUESTION:

Is this case like Kern-Limerick to the

3 extent it has third party dealings —

MR. FREIDMAN:

4

No.

I wanted to continue, Justice

5 White.
6

QUESTION*

7

MR. FREIDMAN:

8

Please do.
Second, in Kern-Limerick the

government plastered the contracts and plastered the

9 purchase orders with clear statements;
10

they are merely our agents, we will pay.

we will be bound,
It was done

11 deliberately to conserve federal funds.

No such language is found here until July 1,

12

13 when very timid contractual modifications are inserted
14 in
15 way

1977,
only

the contracts, leaving the purchase orders exactly the
they were, leaving all the relationships exactly the way

16 they were.

Third, Kern-Limerick inserted all this contractual

17

18 language long in advance of the taxman coming calling.
19 Here,

the contracts are modified two years into a tax case.

20 I think

this is a case in which putting in the -- it

21 indicates the government's interpretation of the
22 Kern-Limerick case.

I don't believe that this Court

23 intended that the mere insertion of certain magic words
l

24 the time the taxman
25 protecting

at

came knocking was the intent of

the government against affronts to its supremacy.
39

1

We are long past the days of McCulloch v. Maryland

2 when there was danger that discriminatory taxation by the
3 states would consume the newly-hatched federal government.
4 If anything, the shoe is on the other foot today.

But

5 having given the power to federal contracting officers to
6 insert agency-creating clauses, whatever the wisdom of that
7 balance may be, it seems to me that great scrutiny should be
8 given when the affront to the supremacy of the United States
9 that is claimed is self-created, and when, in fact, these
10 contractors are indistinguishable from other cost plus
11 contractors.

The only difference here is the advanced

12 f unding.
13

Our brief indicates clearly that advanced funding

14 was viewed by the Atomic Energy Commission only as a
15 reimbursement method for cost plus contractors.

You paid

16 them in advance, but later on you had an audit and you
17 netted out what you would have advanced against what would
18 otherwise be subject to reimbursement.
19

QUESTION:

Didn't the contract in Carson also

20 involve advanced funding?
21

MR. FREIDMAN:

22

QUESTION:

It did. Justice Powell.

So why do you say that's the only

23 difference here?
24

MR. FREIDMAN;

25

QUESTION:

Well, it’s similar.

I'm sorry.

The contract is almost identical, isn't
40

1

it?

The contract involved in Carson is almost identical to

2 the contract here.

3

ME. FREIDMAN;

That is correct. Justice Powell,

4 and I think it is significant that at the time that Congress
5 reversed -- if you will pardon that expression -QUESTION;

6

Congress repealed Section 9(b),

7 following Carson.
MR. FREIDMANs

8

That’s right.

But they left intact

9 Section 4(c) which this Court had referred to in
10

Roane-Anderson.

11

Obviously, in repealing the Roane-Anderson

12 decision, I

don’t believe that Congress intended that chance

13 contractual clauses could be grouped together to equal an
14 agency relationship.

That is simply the way the Atomic

15 Energy Commission has always done business.

Thank you very

16 much.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER -- Rebuttal
MR. JONES;

I have two points.

First, in both

23 and provisions of Sandia’s purchase order, and the purchase
24 order or standard terms of Zia's purchase order they
25 indicate that any claims against the contractor arising out

5 official who supervises the contract, and if —
6

QUESTION:

Excuse me, that’s sort of an

7 arbitration of a dispute.
8

HR. JONES:

And if the dispute is not resolved at

9 that point, the supplier must seek redress before the
10 Department of Energy Contract Board of Appeals.
11

QUESTION:

But that doesn't mean he wins* that

12 just tells him where to go to get -13

MR. JONES:

But that very clearly indicates that

14 he has a claim against the United States.

And if he's not

15 satisfied with the conclusion of the Contract Board of
16 Appeals, his recourse is to seek judicial review.
17

QUESTION:

Well, I don’t know if that follows.

18 The contract might say that he has to go to the American
19 Arbitration Association, but it doesn’t mean the American
20 Arbitration Association will be liable on the contract.
21

But let me ask you a different question.

22 Supposing there was a contract, an order to purchase
23 something for delivery in six months, and there was a -24 then a cancellation of the order, which would be in normal
25 commercial terms, a breach of the contract.

Would you say

1 that the vendor could then sue the United States directly?
2

ME. JONES;

Yes.

Sue both the contractor and the

3 United States.
4

QUESTION;

5 something like that.

Say the contractor went insolvent or
You say there’s definitely a direct

6 obligation -- and that’s the key to your case, is it?

The

7 United States is obligated on the contract.
8

ME. JONES;

Well, it follows from our position

10 necessarily follows.

It

The consequence of having an agent act

11 for you is that you are bound by their actions -12

QUESTION;

That’s even before they’re paid, so you

13 really don’t have to rely on advanced funding, if that’s
14 right.
15

MR. JONES;

16

QUESTION;

17 may.

Well, that's right, yes.
Let me ask one other question if I

With regard to the 50 or 60% of the receipts by the

18 contractor that are used to reimburse his own empl oyees, not
19 to pay vendors, does the government contend that those
20 receipts are also immune from the tax?
21

MR. JONES; Yes.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. JONES; Yes, absolutely.

24

QUESTION;

You do?

And the

whole purchasing relationship

25 has nothing to do with that part of — say you had a
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 contractor that didn't ever buy anything; had all the same
2 contractual setup, but all they did was do a lot of research
3 and services of one kind or another.

You'd say they're

4 still immune?
5

MR. JONES;

That's right, because the contractors

6 have no interest in the money.

They purchase these services

7 of these third parties -8

QUESTION;

No, the third parties here are

9 employees.
10

MR.

JONES;

That's right, but they hire these

11 employees for the United States, to provide services to

the

12 United States.
13

QUESTION;

But the employees are not United States

14 employees.
15

MR. JONES;

16

QUESTION;

That's right.
And if the employees were not paid by

17 the contractor, the employees then go to the Court of
18 Claims, against the United States?
19

MR. JONES;

I suppose they would have a contract

20 claim against the United States in the Court of Claims.
21

QUESTION;

Well, was your answer yes?

22

MR. JONES;

23

And one final point.

Yes.
The contract modifications

24 in this case that the state makes so much of in 1977 simply
25 confirmed what nobody denied until 1967.

Even the state of

this sort were agents of the United States, even though

the case does turn on whether the United States is

What if you were wrong on that?

Would

lose the case?

12

SR. JONES;

No.

Well, I mean I can't be wrong on

13 that if these guys are agents.

If the contractors are

14 agents for the United States, then the United States is
15 bound by their contractual undertakings on behalf of the
16 United States.
