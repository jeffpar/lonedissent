ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. PITLER , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. PITLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court, in this case, federal habeas corpus has been

9 granted to a state prisoner because of so-called
10 reprehensible prosecutorial error, even though an analysis
11 of the case demonstrates that this error did not prejudice
12 the accused.

Thus, the issue that is presented here is

13 whether this prosecutorial conduct in fact prejudiced the
14 accused, and if it did not prejudice him, whether a federal
15 court to express disapproval of that conduct can grant
16 habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner.

17

Also presented in this case is whether this Court

18 should overrule long and well settled precedents.

These

19 precedents establish that the right to an impartial jury
20 guaranteed by the Constitution is one which only requires
21 that jurors remain free from actual bias.
22

Respondent wants this Court to replace that

23 principle with one which requires the removing of a sitting
24 juror upon facts which might render a hypothetical juror
25 biased, even though it is shown that the particular juror in

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the case remained actually impartial.

2

QUESTION;

Would you say that the court of

3 appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge Pierce's grant
4 of habeas corpus in the district court on the same ground?
5

MR. PITLER:

6 different ground.

No, I would think it is a completely

To place that decision in context, I

7 would like to go back to the state proceedings, and then
8 just bring it to the Second

Circuit decision and Judge

9 Pierce's decision.
10

Let me answer your question directly.

11 Pierce used the implied

bias standard.

Judge

The circuit court, I

12 think without regard to prejudice at all, just said the

13 prosecutor's error -- there is prosecutorial error here,
14 consequently there must be a reversal.

They didn't look to

15 implied bias at all.
16

QUESTION;

You mean the court of appeals in

17 effect took a per se standard?
18

MR. PITLER:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, I believe so.
find you think Judge Pierce — implied

20 bias was not the same?

Do you think it is different?

21

MR. PITLER:

I think it is different.

22

This case arose out of a killing on Christmas

23 Eve, 1968, when after unsuccessfully trying to extort money
24 from a person. Respondent William Phillips, then a New York
25 City police officer, killed that person whom he was

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 extorting, or sought to extort,

killed another eye witness,

2 and sought to kill even -- killed an eye witness and sought
3 to kill a second eye witness.

That person survived.

Three years later, in 1971, Respondent was

4

5 indicted and his first trial in
6

because of a hung jury.

1972 ended in a mistrial

In 1974, he was brought to trial

7 again and convicted.

During the voir dire at the second trial, the

8

9 defense found one John Dana Smith acceptable as a juror.
10 Smith was a

Vietnam veteran who was about to graduate

11 Columbia College, and he was accepted by the defense even

12 though he worked as a security guard or in a security
13 position in

Bloomingdale's, and was then actively seeking a

14 law enforcement job, and at the time had an application
15 pending with a federal law enforcement agency.
16

Subsequently, during trial Smith was having lunch

17 with a friend, a court officer in a court that had nothing
18 to do with this case,

and was sitting and talking, and the

19 court officer, who knew Smith's wife from John Jay College,
20 said,

"I am applying for a job in the District Attorney's

21 Office as an investigator.

There may be some jobs there

22 that you might be interested in," and Smith asked about the
23 jobs.

They didn’t know much about it, but Smith said,

24 "Well, how should

I apply," and he says, "Well, write a

25 resume and send a letter to the District Attorney’s Office,

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and

I will find out more details on how to apply for you."

2

And that is what Smith did a week later, sent a

3 letter saying, "I hear you have positions open in major
4 felony investigating unit,
5 Dana Smith,

and he sent his resume.

6 anything about him being a

When did the trial prosecutor learn of

ME. PITLEHi

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. PITLER*

12

QUESTION*

In the middle of the trial.
In the middle of the trial?
That is correct.
And at that time, do I understand that

13 there were several alternates?
14

HR. PITLERs

15

QUESTION*

Yes, there were.
And had this been brought to the

16 attention then of the trial judge, had the trial prosecutor
17 told him about it,

I take it an alternate could have been

18 substituted ?
19

MR. PITLERt

It would have been up to the

20 discretion of the trial judge.
21

QUESTION*

Whether he would or not.

But he might

22 have?
23

MR. PITLER*

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PITLER*

Yes, he could have.
There were four alternates.
I believe that is correct.

1

QUESTION;

Isn't that really the key fact in this

2 whole case?

3

ME. PITLER;

Hell, if you — it seems to me that

4 under New York — if you look under New York law at the
5 time, and even today, the judge would have discretion
6 provided he found the juror actually biased, or actually

/influenced, and that discretion is virtually unreviewable as
8 it is in federal court.
9

QUESTION:

Well, you are not saying he had

10 discretion if there had been actual bias.
11

MR. PITLER:

No.

No, in other words, in making

12 that determination he would give great weight to it, if he
13 found actual —
14

QUESTION;

But if he found actual bias, he would

15 have had a clear duty.
16

MR. PITLER;

That's correct.

Yes, he would have

17 to exclude the juror.
18

QUESTION;

Then he would have risked, I suppose,

19 if the defense hadn’t consented to it, a charge of double
20 jeopardy if he had tried to go ahead with the trial.
21

MR. PITLER:

The exact scope of the double

22 jeopardy clause in that context I am not sure of, whether it
23 would bar a subsequent trial.
24

QUESTION;

Do you mean that in New York, if a

25 juror is excused and replaced by an alternate juror, that

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 gives rise to a double jeopardy
2

MR. PITLERj

3

QUESTION;

No, I don’t think, it does.
Well, if the judge is given this

4 information at that time, and he didn’t find that this man
5 was biased, he could still have removed him.
6

MR. PITLER;

I think a reading of the state -- if

7 he found that he was not biased, I don’t think the judge
8 could have removed him under New York law at the time.
9
10

QUESTION;

He has to have actual bias?

MR. PITLER;

I believe that is correct, under the

11 law at the time.
12

QUESTION;

Give me that case.

I would like to

13 see it.
14

MR. PITLER;

15 would read CPL Section
16

QUESTION;

17

MR. PITLER;

I believe that would be the way I
270.35.
Which one?
Criminal Procedure Law Section

18270.35, Subdivision 2, which is repeated on Page 2A of our
19 brief.

20

QUESTION;

I gather that the Second Circuit, at

21 least, thought that as a matter of the federal Constitution
22 that that situation did not require a determination of
23 actual bais.

Isn’t that right?

24

MR. PITLER;

25

QUESTION;

It is not clear what —
Well, in any event, surely the Second

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Circuit did not follow, as you have now described it, the
2 New York rule, dii it?
ME. PITLEEs

3
4 all.

No, they don’t really discuss it at

They say it is a good likelihood the judge would have

5 removed him and consequently the Defendant was -- Eespondent
6 was denied a fair trial.
7

QUESTIONS

That is all they said.

Well, how do you understand that?

How

8 does that differ, do you think, if it does, if you think so,
9 from the New York —
10

MB. PITLEEs

Well, I think this — at least under

11 New York law they would be suggesting there is a good chance
12 the judge would have found him actually biased and removed
13 him .
14

QUESTIONS

Is that what you think they said?

15

MB. PITLEEs

Well, if they were saying that he

16 would exercise a discretion

that I don’t think he has to

17 remove the juror, then I don’t think that -18

QUESTIONS

Well, surely, I thought there was a

19 difference between how you construe the New York rule and
20 the way the Second Circuit looked at, isn't there?
21

QUESTIONS

That’s right.

22

ME. PITLEEs

I am not sure I understand your

23 question .
24

QUESTIONS

Well, surely, the standard applied by

25 the Second Circuit is different from the one that you

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 suggest is the New

York. rule.

MR. PITLERi

2

3 standard at all.

I don't think they applied any

I think what they said is, the prosecutor

4 failed to disclose that this juror applied
5 his office,
6 and

for a job with

the defendant was entitled to that disclosure,

wherefore we reverse.

They say at the end of the

7 opinion, we simply -- their holding is —
8

QUESTION;

Well, they said, we reverse because we

9 think that fact, circumstance establishes a violation of the
10 federal Constitution.
11

MR. PITLER:

Well, yes, and if they are saying

12 that, if you are suggesting to me that they are saying that
13 that juror is in fact biased -14

QUESTION;

I don't know that they even addressed

15 whether he was in fact biased.
16

MR. PITLER;

Well, but if he is not, if he is not

17 biased, it is hard for me to see what constitutional right
18 would be violated by the prosecutor.
19

QUESTION:

Well, they say just as a matter of per

20 se — that conduct per se was a violation of the federal
21 Constitution.
22

MR. PITLER;

23

QUESTION;

The application for the job.
Yes.

No, the knowledge of the

24 prosecutor, and his failure to disclose it to the trial
25 judge.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. PITLER:

But unless the prosecutor's failure

2 prejudices the defendant in seme way, I think this Court has
3 made clear that you do not get a reversal.

The Agurs case

4 stands for that proposition.
5

QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals said you do

6 get a reversal.
7

MR. PITLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. PITLER:

10 is here.
11

That is why they are wrong.
That is why the case is here?
And I believe that is why the case

Thank you. Justice White.
QUESTION:

Well, does the Second Circuit holding

12 amount to reading the word "may” in 270.35(2), where the
13 provision is, the court may in the circumstances, may if an
14 alterna te juror is available, discharge the juror -- is the
15 Second Circuit in your view reading that as the court must?
16

MR. PITLER:

17

QUESTION:

Well, this is really —
Is that the effect of the Second

18 Circuit holding?
19

MR. PITLER:

Yes, but I think if the judge — the

20 answer to your question is yes, but if the judge in fact
21 found the juror biased, I think the Constitution would
22 require him to remove the juror, but that is not what the
23 Second Circuit's holding is all about.
24

I think they didn’t care about whether this juror

25 was baised actually or impliedly.

They said the prosecutor

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 breached a duty, and that ends our inquiry.

They don't care

2 about whether or not -- you know, what would follow from
3 that, and indeed in their holding at the end of their
4 opinion, we simply hold when someone has applied for a job
5 with the prosecutor’s office, he must disclose it.

That is

6 the holding of the Second Circuit.
7

QUESTION;

Well, Hr. Pitler, in the case of the

8 application of 270.35, if the judge determines somewhere in
9 the course of the trial that a juror is actually biased, and
10 says, I am going to remove this juror and substitute an
11 alternate, does that require the consent of the defendant?
12

MR. PITLERi

No, it would not, although as a

13 practical matter if the defendant objected, it would seem to
14 me he would probably be waiving any right that he might
15 assert, and if I were a trial judge and I said to the
16 defendant that I think this juror is actually biased and the
17 defendant said no, keep him on, as a practical matter I
18 would leave the juror on.

It is the defendant's right.

19 Unless there was prejudice against the prosecutor.
20

QUESTION;

Then wouldn't the defendant have a

21 right to argue on appeal in the New York courts that the
22 judge improperly applied the statute?
23

MR. PITLER;

Not where the defendant consented.

24 I think it would be out of court in the New York courts, if
25 the defendant consented.

Certainly it would be out of court

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in the court of appeals, and I don't think any appellate
2 division would exercise discretion in that case to reverse.

3

But assuming that -- I know this is going to be a

4 hard assumption to take, but assume the prosecutor didn't
5 find out about it until after trial, the juror's
6 application.

What this Court has held the remedy in that

7 situation to be is, you have a post-trial hearing to
8 determine the bias or lack of bias of the juror.

That is

9 what this Court has held.
10

Now, unless we are going to punish the prosecutor

11 -- and that hearing is adequate to protect the defendant's
12 constitutional right to a jury trial.

Now, unless you are

13 going to say, because of the prosecutorial misconduct, that
14 procedure is not adequate, I mean, that is the only way you
15 could say that, and in effect what you are saying is, you
16 are going to punish the state for the prosecutor’s
17 misconduct, even though there is a procedure available which
18 can determine whether or not that

juror was baised, and we

19 don't think the law requires such a holding by this Court.
20

Now, in Agurs, you had — the Court found that

21 there would be prejudice, and Agurs is a case, of course,
22 dealing with guilt or innocence context, where the
23 prosecutor fails to disclose clearly exculpatory evidence or
24 doesn't respond to a request or lets perjured testimony come
25 into trial, and in that context, this Court held that no, it

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is not a rule of automatic reversal.
2 see

You have to look to

whether or not the defendant was prejudiced, and they

3 built into those three standards a prejudice rule, in effect
4

We are saying the same thing — a similar

5 requirement is true here, but the nature of the right is
6 different.

There, you are dealing with a right to submit

7 evidence to the jury, and the only remedy that you could
8 have once you found a prosecutor's breach of duty, the only

9 appropriate remedy is then to submit the case to a new jury.
10

When you are dealing with the impartiality of a

11 juror, however, where the judge was going to hold — would
12 hold an inquiry during trial, how is the defendant
13 prejudiced

if the prosecutor fails to hold — turn over

14 information if the hearing is held after trial?

That

15 hearing has been recognized as adequate.
16

In other words, I think it is what Justice White

17 said in the Morrison case.

You have got to tailor the

18 remedy to the conduct involved.

Here, the conduct involved

19 was the right to an impartial jury, and did the prosecutor
20 -- the appropriate remedy under the Remmer case is to have
21 the pretrial hearing.
22

Now, the Court in Agurs said, well, we have to

23 take into consideration somehow that the prosecutor failed
24 to disclose, and in

Agurs what you did was, you said, well,

25 we won't follow the ordinary newly discovered evidence

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

rule

1 which requires the defendant to prove that he was

pr ove

2 by a preponderance of the evidence that the result would
3 have been different.
4

What the state judge did here is, he required

5 that the prosecutor establish beyond a reasonable doubt that
6 the juror was impartial.
7

QUESTION*

Mr. Pitler, do you think there is a

8 role for a rule of implied bias under some circumstances?

9

MR. PITLER:

Perhaps, yes, but not in the

10 circumstances of this case.

In United States versus Wood,

11 which we cite in our brief, there is a case for the
12 argument that government employees should automatically be
13 impliedly biased in any criminal prosecution of the federal
14 goverment brought, and that case held there would be no
15 requirement of implied bias in that situation, and they went
16 further,

I think, because they talked about particular

17 circumstances, and they raised the situation, what about a

18 situation when a juror works, a potential juror works for an
19 agency very interested in the case, or interested in the
20 case, and the court said there, an inquiry about actual bias
21 is more than enough to deal with that situation.
22

Whether or not there would be situations that one

23 could conjur up where you would want to find someone
24 impliedly biased is a question that is not before the Court
25 today, but certainly on the facts of this case I think the

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Wood case would control, and at least where a juror has only
2 applied for a job there should be no rule of implied bias.
3

QUESTION;

Well, didn't the juror think it was --

4 didn't he mention it to the prosector?
5

HR. PITLER:

6

QUESTION;

No, Your Honor, the juror —
How did the prosecutor find out about

7 this?
8

MR. PITLER;

The way the prosecutor found out is

9 that the letter eventually got to the person in charge of
10 hiring, and a friend of the juror mentioned to an assistant
11 district attorney that this person was on the jury.
12 juror himself never mentioned it.

QUESTION;

And did Fontane then have further

conversations with people in the prosecutor's office?
MR. PITLER;

Yes, he had at least one with an

20 assistant district attorney, where he said, listen,

you

21 know, my friend applied for a job and he is a juror, do you
22 think there is anything wrong about that, and that was when
23 the assistant district attorney said, look, we are not going
24 to process that application, and they -- and he went back
25 and told the person in charge of hiring, and that person put

QUESTION*

And who told the trial prosecutor

3 about all this?

4

MR. PITLERi

The assistant district attorney in

5 charge of hiring for that position, Ms. Sudolnik.
6

QUESTION*

And at that stage, the juror thought

7 that possibly there might be a problem?
8

MR. PITLER*

9

QUESTION*

No.

No.

Well, I misunderstood you.

Why did he

10 ask. him to mention it to the district attorney's office?
11

MR. PITLER*

He didn't ask him to mention it.

He

12 just asked him to submit the application with his, because
13 he was applying at the same time.
14

QUESTION*

And didn't he say to find out whether

15 there was any problem?
16

MR. PITLER*

No,

there is nothing in --.no,

17 nothing, no discussion about any problem or anything.

As a

18 matter of fact, there is a finding, both by the district
19 court and the state court judge that the juror was totally
20 unaware and did not authorize anything that was going on,
21 and the juror testified, which was credited by the state
22 judge, that he saw absolutely no connection with his job
23 application and his service on the jury, he did not know
24 anything that anybody, you know, was talking to anyone.
25

You know, you can look at facts, and you can put

12 it would apply — requiring must, you must remove the juror

such trial juror may not be discharged, and the trial must

MR. PITLER;

1

MS. PITLER;

2

You know, the Court hasn't asked me about why

3 isn 't this hearing

It certainly is.

— why is this hearing adequate.

The

4 Remmer case, of course, held that these post-trial hearings
5 are adequate, and they are adequate in federal court and
6 adequate in

state court, and it seems to me unless you want

7 to say that you have a per se rule because the prosecutor
8 failed

to disclose it, that these hearings should be held

9 adequate on federal habeas corpus review of a state
10 conviction.

11

It seems to me that it might be beneficial for

12 the Court for me to

tell you about Judge Birns's finding,

13 because there is some concern here, and here, Judge Birns
14 found that the juror was honest but naive.

He was naive

15 because, you know, he didn't realize that someone would see
16a connection.

He saw no connection between applying for a

17 job — and the judge found that he was under no influence
18 during the trial.

On the voir dire -- this is not like a

19 juror coming out from nowhere and saying, I want something
20 in exchange for my

21

participation on the jury.

On the voir dire, he indicated that he was

22 interested in law enforcement, and he applied

well into

23 trial, when he just met a friend at lunch, and he did
24 nothing else with respect to this application.
25 sent it.

He merely

That is what the findings of the state court are,

1 and despite Respondent's attempt to change that, those are
2 the facts.

He didn’t do anything, Justice Marshal.

3 merely sent the latter.

He

It was an innocent act by a naive

4 young man, and I don't think, that that calls for the kind of
5 habeas corpus review by a federal court of a state
6 conviction.
7

The state court held the hearing that this Court

8 requires all the time in federal cases.

Why, then, merely

9 because of the prosecutor’s misconduct, is that hearing
10 going to be held inadequate?
11

Returning to your question of implied bias, in

12 Frazier versus United States, and of course the Wood case
13 says you have a right to an impartial jury, and that
14 constitutional right. Wood says, means a jury that is free
15 from actual bias, and if the jury is free from actual bias,
16 that really generally ends the inquiry, and Wood —

QUESTIONS

Mr. Pitler, under that rule in New

18 York, suppose you had a juror who had been the victim of an
19 armed robbery, and then he was called as a juror on an armed
20 robbery case, and he didn’t disclose the fact that he had
21 been himself the victim of an armed robbery.

Would your

22 procedure require a determination of actual bias in that
23 case, no implied bias?

Hr. Pitier, let me just ask one quick

I am not quite sure what your view was.

If the

10

and the judge had found the facts the way he did, do you

11 think he would have let the trial go forward without
12 replacing the juror?

MR. PITLER:

He said in his opinion -- I don’t

He said that as a matter of law, he would not

have found that juror biased.

That is correct.

But you don't know whether he would

have construed New York law nevertheless to authorize it.

19 You -20

MR. PITLER:

No, I think the reality would have

21 been, he would have said to the prosecutor, don't you think
22 You should consent to the removal of the juror, and I don't

13

MR. PITLER;

Of his own view.

That is correct.

14

Again, and I guess it is — your questions to me

15 brought that out, Justice White, that the Second Circuit
16 here is concerned

with the prosecutorial misconduct.

That

17 is how they are —
18

QUESTION:

I didn’t mean to ask for a prediction

19 of what the Second Circuit would do.

I just wondered how

20 you read their opinion.
21

MR. PITLER;

No, I read it that way, but

22 analytically I think that that is important, and the reason
23 I think that is important is that they would have come out
24 the same way, if they would have come out a different way.

What is the rule in the cases in this

HR. PITLER:

With respect to possible bias of a

United States versus Wood, I think, is the leading

11 case, and that is the case I referred to in my discussion
12 with Justice O'Connor, and that says that in recent jury
13 selection, and I think there is a tougher standard during
14 trial, that has to be actual bais, and that case has stood
15 for 45 years as the laws of this Court, and to change that
16 rule, to go to an implied bias standard based on this case,
17 in effect,

you are no going to have to sit in review of all

18 the various state implied bias statutes, and as we point out
19 in our brief, they are many and numerous, and they are going
20 to be sat both in direct appeal to this Court and federal
21 habeas corpus review, and I don't think that is necessary.

Wood has served very well in the 45 years, and

Mr. Kunstler

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. KUNSTLER, ESQ.,

3

ORAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

MR. KUNSTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5 please the Court, I first want to apologize for what may be
6a very hoarse voice, something that I picked up in Oregon

7 two days ago, and there is nothing much I can do about it.
8

This case is a unique one.

It was called that

g not only by myself in our brief, but it was called by the
10 trial judge himself as unprecedented imprudence on the part
11 of the prosecutor, unique misjudgment by the prosecutor,
12 extraordinary, about the submission of the application for a

13 job in the middle of trial.
14

It involves essentially, and I think Mr. Pitler

15 has stated some of it, a juror applying for a job in a
16 capital prosecution, and his course to the application began
17 on the very day that he was selected, when he heard, even
18

before other jurors had been seated, when he heard in a

19 lunch with court officers about the opening of a job on the
20 major felony squad of the district attorney’s office.
21

That was on, I believe, September 23rd, 197U.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Kunstler, do you agree that the

23 reasoning of the court of appeals was somewhat different
24 than the reasoning of Judge Pierce?
25

MR. KUNSTLER:

Justice Rehnquist, I do, but

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 differently than Mr. Pitler does, because I thought that
2 what the court of appeals was doing in using R.gurs as a
3 standard was to say essentially that the prosecution's
4 misconduct prevented the defendant from exercising a right
5 that he had under 270.35, that because he didn’t know about
6 it, he couldn’t go to the trial judge at a time when removal
7 of a juror is far simpler than it is after conviction, and
8 utilize that statute, and that statute does not say that you
9 need an actual biased juror.

It says a juror — the fact

10 that a juror is grossly unqualified to sit in a case -- that
11 is one standard — or, and I think that is what we have
12 here, a juror engaged in misconduct of a substantial nature.
13

Phillips never had that opportunity, because of

14 the non-disclosure.
15

QUESTIONS

But those are state statutes.

I mean,

16 you have got to find the violation of a federal
17 constitutional —
18

MR. KUNSTLER;

I understand that, but I think one

19 of the aspects of due process is preventing the utilization
20 of available statutes, remedial statutes.

I think if a

21 prosecutor engages in conduct that prevents that
22 utilization, you have a substantial due process question
23 that has not been fully briefed on either side here, but I
24 think it has existed.
25

QUESTION:

Even if without the statute there

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 would be no due process violation?
MR. KUNSTLER:

2

Well, to a degree.

I think a

3 statute that gives you a remedial right presents a due
4 process

situation.

The Second Circuit, if it is read the

5 way Mr. Pitler is saying, is saying, under Agurs, you have a
6 right where something is withheld deliberately which may in

7 some way affect your trial to utilize it.
8 you divorce the statutes out of it,

270.35,

And I think if
you can read

9 another ground, but I thought the Second Circuit was very
10 much concerned about the fact that they were denied a right

11 that they had under state law to utilize, which I think is a
12 due

process — rises to due process proportions.

13

If a right is existent under state law and the

14 prosecutor deliberately prevents you from achieving that
15 right, I think it is a due process violation.
16 sure,

But I am not

Justice Rehnquist, which way the circuit went.

I

17 don *t think it is the most artful of opinions that I have
18 ever read, and you can read it under Agurs and you can read
19 it under my interpretation, but either one I accepted
20 because

21

they affirmed it.

The trial was then

His letter went to a district attorney Convoy,

15

16 who referred it to Ms. Suldonik, who was in charge of
17 personnel recruitment at that time.

She referred it to an

18 Assistant District Attorney Lang, who was Suldonik's
19 subordinate, and then there was a lot of comm unication
20

between Lang and not only this court officer but another one

21 in

which Lang is told that Smith is a juror in the Phillips

22 trial.

So, whether Mr. Smith told him to tell that or

They got together, they testified

QUESTION:

21 evening.

MR. KUNSTLER:

No, it was undoubtedly a recess,

In fact, there was one meeting on the

15th

of

22 November, the next day after the prosecutors discovered it,
23 that Holmes, one of the district attorneys who was involved
24 in the processing of the application, met with Mr. LaPenta,
25 who was the second in command of the trial team, and tried

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to talk to him about it, and LaPenta told him, I don’t want
2 to listen to that, I don’t want to hear that any more, and
3 that was the end.

That was the last that you have as far as

4 the prosecutors, but it was deliberate, wilful decision not
5 to tell anyone, including the district attorney himself, Mr.
6 Kuh, who never learned of it.
After — as soon as the trial ended, then, of

7

8 course, Mr. Smith called Ms. Sudolnik up, the very next day
9 after judgment, after verdict, he called Ms. Sudolnik up.
10 He couldn't reach her, and so he got a friend of his, a Mr.
11 Reilly, who ran, and I think still does, the Bloomingdaie
12 security office in New York, he got Mr. Reilly to call up
13 Ms. Sudolnik, and Mr. Reilly said, what gives with Smith’s
14 application.
15 trial.

And I think the implications of that statement were

16 hardly lost

17

He was a juror in the just completed Phillips

on anyone.
In any event, Ms. Sudolnik told him then that the

18 juror’s application would be considered in the normal course
19 of business.

That is the day after the jury’s conviction.

20 The district attorney, Mr. Kuh, never learned of this until
21 December 4th of 1974, some two weeks or so after verdict,
22 when Mr. LaPenta told Mr. Kuh's assistant, John Keenan, in
23 an elevator in the Federal Building where Phillips had a
24 habeas on another matter going, told Mr. Keenan that one of
25 the jurors had applied for a job during the trial.

38

Mr. Keenan told the district attorney, Richard

2 Kuh, and then five days later they informed the trial
3 judge.

find the trial judge did hold a hearing, both on

4 Juror Number Three and Juror Number Six.
5

So, the sequence you have is that at least by the

6 13th of November the district attorney's office, many people
7 knew that Smith was a juror in the Phillips case, and that
8 Smith had an application pending in the office.
9

QUESTION«

Any effort to explain why Mr. Kuh was

10 not told until after the trial?
MR. KUNSTLERi

11

I can't remember the transcript

12 that well. Justice Brennan, but he was not told until
13 December 4th.

I guess the reason is, the prosecutors, the

14 trial prosecutors did not tell Mr. Keenan until that day,
15

when they were at the federal court hearing, when he said,

16

in words of substance, by the way, did you hear this, and

17

told him, and then Mr. Keenan on the 4th told Mr. Kuh, so it

18 was the suppression at the lower level, the trial
19

prosecutor's level, as well as by all these other district

20 attorneys who knew of it.

I think, as I remember the

I am certain

3 jury:

I have an application pending with the very office

4 which is prosecuting the defendant.

Or, if he had said so

5 in the middle, I am certain Judge Birns would have excused
6 him.

Judge Birns is speaking ex post facto.

He has just

7 gone through a highly publicized, very significant murder
8 trial, and the prospect of setting it aside now is a much
9 more difficult task for a trial judge, as we all know, than
10 doing it in the middle of trial, when all you can do is
11 excuse the juror and put an alternate in his place.

Mr. Kunstler, what are the

13 possibilities of biasing the jury if he files this

I don't think so.

Just take this

If they had gone up to Mr. Smith and

13 questioned him after the verdict, I don’t think he would
14 have said, listen, by the way, I sent a letter in in the
15 middle of trial.

I think he would have just said, the

16 questions are, how did you decide, why did you decide this
17 way, I did it for X, Y, and Z.

But you would never find

18 about the letter, and it is the letter that makes the
19 situation -- he is a job seeker with the prosecutor.
20

QUESTIONS

You don't allege that the post-trial

21 hearing which was held was anything but fair, do you?
22

SR. KUNSTLERs

No, but it is an impossible

23 hearing, because it is not like the Remmer hearing, that Mr.
24 Pitler relies on.

In Remmer, the standard was not the

25 internal workings of a juror's mind who is guilty of

Law enforcement was an interim occupation for him.

5 Enforcement Agency, overseas for a year, come back and go to
6 law school.

So, imagine if he had ever said on the stand,

11 in law enforcement.

He could never get a job

And he might be prosecuted for

12 contempt, certainly, if not under the criminal statutes we

I don’t think those criminal statutes, to be

15 candid, apply to this juror.

misconduct.

But certainly contempt would not be

13 me he would be fair and was fair, and I accept it, because
14 all the other evidence had nothing to do with him, when the
15 letters were mailed, and who was spoken to.
16

I might indicate that when he was rejected as

17 being unqualified, he probably knew he was unqualified,
18 because what did he have in life?

He had been a security

19 guard at Bloomingdale's, and he wanted to get on the major
20 case felony squad of the district attorney, and was rejected
21 for being inadequately prepared, and I think he knew that,

^00.

This was a golden opportunity for this man.

He got on

23 the jury of a major case that had been ten to two to for
24 acquittal when Mr. Bailey tried it the first time around.

6 that, Chief Justice Burger, although it came from the

8

QUESTION:

I was speaking of your psychoanalysis

9 of his mental processes.
10

MR. KUNSTLER:

It has to be speculation.

But I

11 think it is speculation -- when you go into implied bias,
12 you have to do it.

When Blackstone said, you can’t have the

13 employer, for example, a juror on a jury who was employed by
14 the other side, that is all speculation, too.

That man

15 could be fair in some actual standard of life, but there are
16 some places you must say, as Chief Justice Marhsall said, we
17 have to draw the line.

1

I might just add in closing, because I see the

2 orange light, that we have submitted a number of cases,
3 very, very extremely recent ones, and Haak against the State
4 in Indiana, I think, is the proper rule, where a juror’s
5 husband had been offered a job with the district attorney’s
6 office, and she knew only his application was pending, and
7 they held that was an implied bias.
We don't think that 2245(D) applies or that the

8

9 Sumner case has any applicability here.

It is a wholly

10 different situation than our case, and in reading the case
11 -- it is mentioned quite prominently in their brief -- we
12 didn’t mention it because we didn’t think it was at all
13 applicable in this case.
14

We don’t think the Remmer type hearing is

15 sufficient here.

You have a serious situation where you

16 have a juror who is expecting a favor, hoping for a favor,
17 and it is more important in this case because he is seeking
18a job.

I wouldn’t feel as strong, although I would be

19 almost as strong, if he had the job already, because I think
20 it is harder to be fired for voting not guilty than it is to
21 be hired.

I think the standards are totally different in

22 this situation.
23

We have raised the appearance of justice

I don’t

5 think this Court would accept that any more than it did in

In Rose against Mitchell, this Court said, the

7

8 harm is not only to the accused, but to society as a whole,
9 when the appearance of justice is destroyed, and I know you
10 could stop 100 people on the streets in Washington, D. C.,
11 and say, do you think it is fair that a juror in a capital
12 case has an application pending with the district attorney,
13 do you think that would be a fair juror, and I would be very
14 seriously surprised if any one of those hundred or thousand
15 or ten thousand would say, that is fair to me.

I just think

16 it affronts the entire law to hold that a juror like that
17 should sit on a jury in a capital case, and that the
18

prosecutor should withhold the information.

19

I like the prophylactic standard that the Second

20 Circuit hinted at in its decision.

I think there are some

21 cases where the prosecutor does deserve to have a new trial.

I didn’t hear that, Mr. Justice.

How many judges refused to set this

And the appellate division?

MR. KUNSTLER:
15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KUNSTLER:

We had five there.

And they didn't —
They did, too, but they are not in

17 the same position, Justice White, because they are seeking
18 to avoid the enormous expense in setting aside of a jury
19 verdict, which is very hard.

The ordinary person in the

20 street on the appearance of justice standard is not a judge
21 and

is not sitting on this kind of a situation.

So I

22 wouldn't have gone to them in the first place.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. PITLER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

MR. PITLERj

Well, listening to Mr. Kunstler

5 describe the case, it has nothing to do with the
6

relationship to reality or the record.

I mean, the

7 suggestion that the prosecutors deliberately met and chose
8 not to disclose this to the court is just not true.
9 happened is that Mr.

Litman was standing outside Mr.

What

He was in the middle of

He said, oh, my God, that is all I have

just don't tell anybody, just don't contact him

at all, have everyone have no contact, and that was the
15 extent of the decision in this case.
16

For Mr. Kunstler to suggest to this Court that

17 the juror then made his move, as soon as he was selected for
18 the jury, I recommend a reading,

Mr. Kunstler, and to the

19 Court, the record in the case.
20

QUESTION*

What about the other juror?

They did

21 tell the judge about the other juror.

MR. PITLERj

while, and

25 they finally disclosed that.

Don't you think, the possibility of

Judge, I really do not think so, and

Mr. Kunstler would make it seem

That is not true.

That was three weeks after he had been sitting

12 about — and that is when he first found out about it.

So,

13 to try to create this impression of prosecutors running

14 around and conspiring and the juror running around and
15 actively seeking is just not true.

It has no -- if you read

16 our brief and if you read the record, you will see what

You had an innocent, naive juror who was

The Constitution requires no more.

The state
