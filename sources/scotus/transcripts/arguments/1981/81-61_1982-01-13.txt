ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. CALVIN GOLUMBIC, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. GOLUMBIC;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

9 Court, the court of appeals in this case decided that the
10 substantive terms of the collective bargaining agreement
11 embodied in an employee benefit trust was subject to review
12 by federal courts for reasonableness, under the sole and
13 exclusive benefit provision of Section 302(c)(5) of the
14 Taft-Hartley Act.
15

This decision, we submit, is inconsistent with the

16 intent of Congress, as revealed by the national labor laws.
17 The national labor laws were based on private bargaining
18 with governmental supervision alone.
19 concerned with

Congress was not

the substantive terms upon which parties

20 agreed.
21

Accordingly, this Court has on numerous occasions

22 rejected attempts by federal courts to substitute their own
23 judgment for that of the collective bargaining parties.
24 course,

collective bargaining agreements and collective

25 bargaining parties are not subject to unqualified
3

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Of

1 authority.

A collective bargaining agreement may be

2 reviewed and revised if it violates the Constitution or
3 federal law, but absent such a violation, the collective
4 bargaining procedure should not be interrupted, so long as
5 that process was conducted in good faith.
6

The record before the court of appeals in this case

7 clearly reflected that the agreement to exclude the widows
8 and respondent's class was the subject of prolonged,
9 intense, and informed bargaining.

In fact, the court below

10 acknowledged that the -11

QUESTION:

But it was bargaining, wasn’t it?

12

MR. GOLUMBIC:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GOLUMBIC:

Excuse me?

It was bargaining?
The issue was bargained from the day

15 the bargaining commenced until, indeed, the parties decided
16 to agree in order to agree to a final bargaining agreement
17 in order to avoid a strike.
18

Given the fact, given the fact that the agreement

19 in this case was the result of good faith collective
20 bargaining, the court should have restrained, or refrained
21 from reviewing it.

Instead, the court decided to become a

22 party to the negotiations and impose its own view of a
23 desirable settlement.
24

The court justifies its intervention in this case

25 by asserting that the eligibility rules of an employee
4

1 benefit trust established through collective bargaining are
2 subject to review for reasonableness pursuant to the sole
3 and exclusive benefit provision in Section 302(c)(5) of the
4 Taft-Hartley Act.
5

The court, in support of that proposition, the

6 court relies on a series of cases decided by the D. C.
7 Circuit which involve acts undertaken by collective
8 bargaining parties — excuse me, which involve acts
9 undertaken not by collective bargaining parties, but by
10 trustees of employee benefit trusts.

These cases do not

11 support the proposition that authority to review eligibility
12 rules for reasonableness emanates from Section 302(c)(5).
13

QUESTION;

Do you think those cases are correctly

14 decided?
15

MR. GOLUMBIC;

I think those cases are correctly

16 decided, Justice Rehnguist, insofar -- insofar as they rest
17 on the jurisdictional basis of a court of equity to review
18 the discretionary acts of trustees, and insofar as they
19 decided that in those particular instances, in those cases
20 the trustees had abused their discretion.
21

QUESTION;

Properly decided under 302(c)(5)?

22

MR. GOLUMBIC;

The cases were decided on the

23 authority of a court of equity to review the discretionary
24 acts of trustees, and in no instance did the cases rest on a
25 jurisdictional basis under the Taft-Hartley Act, such as
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1
2

Section 302(c) or 302(e).
These cases demonstrate that the authority to

3 review in each of the cases rested on the broad authority of
4 a court of equity to review the discretionary acts of
5 Taft-Hartley trustees.

Other courts also decided that they

6 have authority to review the discretionary acts of

7 Taft-Hartley trustees, and these courts based their
8 authority on Section 302(e),

which in their view authorized

9 the review of employee benefit trusts for a structural
10
11

violation of Section 302(c)(5).
The scope for review under the structural violation

12 doctrine remains unsettled.

The Third Circuit has adopted a

13 rather broad scope of review under the doctrine.

The First

14 Circuit has limited review under the doctrine to
15 ascertaining whether employee benefit trusts conform to the
16 express requirements of Section 302(c)(5).
17

The reason for this diversity of views on the scope

18 of review under the structural violation doctrine is
19 apparent when the structural violation doctrine is traced to
20 its origin.
21

Virtually every court which has adopted a broad

construction of review under the doctrine begins with

22 analysis of

Section 302(c), with the cases decided by the

23 D. C. Circuit upon which the court below relied.

But as we

24 have shown, these cases do not rest on an analysis of
25 Section 302(c)(5), but rather on the broad authority of a
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 court of equity to review the discretionary acts of trustees,
2

In this case, in this case the court of appeals

3 lost sight of the equitable origin of its authority and
4 decided that it may review a collective bargaining provision
5 for reasonableness under the sole and exclusive benefit
6 provision of Section 302(c)(5), but to say that Section
7 302(c)(5) imposes a standard of reasonableness under which
8 the courts may review and revise the fruits of collective
9 bargaining is to ignore th- legislative purpose of Congress
10 in adopting the Taft-Hartley Act.
11

Congress adopted the Taft-Hartley Act, among other

12 things, to prevent labor unions from using welfare funds for
13 their own purposes, and to make sure that those funds were
14 used for the benefit of employees of contributing
15 employers.

It is apparent therefore that the requirement in

16 Section 302(c)(5) that welfare funds must be used for the
17 sole and exclusive benefit of employees was intended only to
18 prevent and prohibit the use of those funds for union
19 officials and other non-employees.
20

It is equally apparent that Section 302(c)(5)

21 imposes no limitation upon the eligibility standards adopted
22 through collective bargaining for the payment of benefits to
23 employees.

So long as those collectively bargained

24 elibigility standards do not permit the payment of benefits
25 to persons other than employees, those standards, we submit,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

are not subject to review under Section 302(c)(5) of the

2 Taft-Hartley

3

Act.

Of course, of course those standards and

4 collectively bargained employee benefit plans are subject to
5 review for compliance with ERISA.
6 adopted

In ERISA, Congress

standards for employee benefit trusts, including

7 standards of vesting participation in funding, standards for
8 reporting and disclosure, and

standards of fiduciary

9 conduct, and significantly, Congress provided that any
10 violation of these standards was subject
11
12

to judicial

challenge in federal courts.
Certainly in enacting this comprehensive

13 legislation governing employee benefit trusts, including a
14 provision for the judicial review of a violation thereof,
15 Congress believes that it was filling a regulatory void.
16 And in light of that fact, this -- the existence of this
17 comprehensive legislation undercuts all arguments for
18 permitting the judicial review of collectively bargained
19 employee benefit trusts pursuant to Section 302(c)(5) of the
20 Taft-Hartley Act.
21

I thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY FRANKLIN SWORD, ESQ.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. SWORD:

Mr. Sword?

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Court, it is important at the outset to note the limits of
2 this case.

The trustees concede three important points.

3 First, the trustees concede if they, the trustees, had
4 formulated this provision, that it would be reviewable.
5 Indeed, there is no disagreement among the lower courts over
6 the courts' power to review eligibility provisions which
7 have been formulated by trustees, and that Section 302
8 prohibits the trustees from formulating eligibility
9 provisions which would deny coverage to persons with
10 substantial contributory work histories while granting
11 benefits to persons with lesser contributory work histories,
12 unless there is a rational nexus between the provision and a
13 valid purpose of a 302 trust.
14

QUESTION;

Mr. Sword, even though your opponent

15 concedes that point, and he did in response to Justice
16 Rehnguist's question, this Court has never so held, has it?
17 Assume that discretion was expressly given to the trustees
18 in a collective bargaining agreement to administer the
19 pension.

Has this Court ever held that the exercise of

20 discretion by the trustees be subject to review?
21
22 Court.

MR. SWORD*

That issue has never been before this

However, in the case of NLRB versus Amax, this Court

23 noted that there are fiduciary duties which are placed on --

It didn't say anything about their

duties being reviewable by a court?

2

MR. SWORD;

I don't believe that any court has ever

3 said that their duties are not reviewable.

QUESTION;

Well, has it ever said

5 reviewable, is my question.

that they are

Has this Court ever said they

6 are reviewable?

MR. SWORD;

How about AMAX?
I believe that the AMAX case talks

duties on trustees?

13

MR. SWORD;

14

QUESTION;

But didn’t say that there are fiduciary

Yes, it did.
Subject to the supervision of a court of

15 equity?
16

MR. SWORD;

17

QUESTION;

Indeed.
So they are reviewable, their decisions,

18 in terms of 302 standards?
19

MR. SWORD;

We take the position that trustees are

20 -- their duties are reviewable.
21

QUESTION;

Well, AMAX hardly dealt with the

22 question of reviewing discretion.

That dealt with the

23 manner in which they are appointed.
24

MR. SWORD;

That's correct.

I don't think there is

25 any doubt in any of the cases that the trustee's actions are
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reviewable, and I think that the lower federal courts which
2 have dealt with the issue of whether trustee formulated
3 eligibility provisions can be arbitrary or not have
4 consistently held that the provisions cannot exclude person
5 who have contributory work histories that are substantial
6 unless there is a rational nexus for the provision.
7

QUESTION:

But there are certainly no cases around

8 that say that the courts may modify the eligibility
9 requirements.

I mean, that the trustees may modify the

10 eligibility requirements.
11

MR. SWORD;

Except this one, maybe.

Except this one, maybe, and the

12 Congress has shown in enacting ERISA, it has provided that
13 trustees are to follow the trust documents only insofar as
14 the trust documents do not cause a breach of any fiduciary
15 duty.
16

And the trustees concede a second point, which is

17 that if the respondents’ husbands had quit work and filed
18 applications for retirements instead of continuing to work
19 in contributory work, that then these widows would be
20 granted this benefit.
21

The third point which the trustees —

22

QUESTION;

Of course, on that point, they also

23 would have gotten $5,000 instead of $2,000 in severance pay
24 wouldn ’ t they?

24

benefits for a number of years, and died.

25

That brother's widow would receive this permanent

If his twin brother could have worked

19 years in a contributory mine, or even more, but

5 years in contributory employment, his family would receive
6 absolutely nothing, no death benefits, his widow would
7 receive no health benefits whatsoever.
8

QUESTION;

Well, if that distinction is arbitrary,

9 the distinction between the $5,000 and $2,000 death benefits
10 is equally arbitrary, isn't it?
11

MB. G0LUMBIC;

Not necessarily, because the death

12 benefit, this $5,000, $2,000 difference is talking about a
13 death benefit, which is a benefit that is provided to the
14 widow of an active miner, and there could be some
15 considerations for the payment of a larger benefit to the
16 widow of someone who is actively working at death.

That is

17 in no way related to the —
18

QUESTION;

Well, I thought it was the other way

19 around, that the one who was the widow of a retired miner

22

MR. SWORD;

Yes.

The contract provides that the

23 widow of a pensioner, upon the pensioner's death, received
24 $2,000.

The widow of an active miner who at the time of his

25 death happened to be working in a union mine, regardless of

MR. SWORD*

-- would receive $5,000.

It is more of

4 a funeral payment.
In fact, the facts of our case show the

5

6 arbitrariness of this situation.

Juanita Hager's husband

7 had worked from the time he was a teenager in the mines.
8 had

worked 39 years in the coal mines.

The last 24 years

9 that he worked was for a contributory employer.
10 Juanita Hager is denied
11

find yet

this benefit because Mr. Hager was

still working in contributory employment at the time he

12 died, and he had not filed

13

He

an application.

Likewie, Gracie Robinson's husband had worked more

14 than 30 years in the coal mines.

The last 21 years of his

15 life he spent working in a contributory coal mine, paying
16 into the funds.

find yet these widows are both denied this

17 benefit that is being provided to some widows whose husbands
18 had as little as one year of contributory service.
19

Throughout this litigation, the trustees have not

20 shown any justification for the provision, any rational
21

nexus between the purpose of a fund and this exclusion.

22 Instead they say that because it was collectively bargained,

23 it is immune from judicial review, and that issue, whether
24 the mere collective bargaining of a provision can immunize
25 it from judicial review is the only issue in this case.
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This cass presents a very narrow set of

2 circumstances, and -3

QUESTION;

Well, isn’t the question rather whether

4 it can immunize it from judicial review or whether judicial
5 review is permissible, or authorized?
6

ME. SWORD;

Well, we contend that judicial review

7 is clearly authorized, that without judicial review these
8 beneficiaries of these funds would in no way have protection.
9

QUESTION;

Well, that doesn’t answer the question,

10 to say that someone is without protection, I mean, if there
11 is no judicial review.

You have to point to some

12 affirmative authority by which the courts review the thing.
13

MR. SWORD;

We contend that that authority is

14 within Section 302 of Taft-Hartley, and within the cases
15 that have interpreted that provision.

When Congress enacted

16 Section 302, it was concerned that the earned contributions
17 of workers could be arbitrarily disposed of by the unions
18 unless there was some protection and some control over these
19 funds.

Congress in 1947 saw a potential for abuse whenever

20 unions had any control over these trust funds, and provided
21 that there would be review, and that -- so that these funds
22 would not become a union war chest.
23

Without 302's protections, eligibility decisions

24 could be made solely on terms to further the union's
25 benefit, not in a manner to further the beneficiaries’

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

benefit.

So, Congress intended 302 to be remedial; it

2 provided a private cause of action, so that the rights could
3 be enforced, and so that workers could protect their rights.
4

Subsequent to Section 302's enactment, numerous

5 federal court cases have ruled that eligibility provisions
6 under a Section 302 trust cannot be arbitrary, that you
7 cannot exclude persons with substantial contributory work
8 histories at the same time you are granting benefits to
9 similarly situated persons with lesser contributory work
10 histories unless the trustees can show a rational nexus
11 between that provision and a valid purpose of the fund,
12 which is to reward workers for their contributory work.
13

It is important to note that Congress has added a

14 number of amendments to Section 302(c)(5) through the years,
15 and that has been, even though there have been two decades
16 of court decisions which have imposed on these trusts this
17 arbitrary prohibition, this prohibition that you cannot have
18 these arbitrary provisions in the trust -19

QUESTION;

Mr. Sword, there really isn't anything,

20 is there, in the legislative history that shows a
21 Congressional intent to set a substantive standard for
22 eligibility retirements, is there?
23

MB. SWORD:

There is nothing in the legislative

24 history to show, you know, the substantive requirements as
25 far as how many years of work or anything along those lines,
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 but the legislative intent does show that Congress couched
2 Section 302 in trust terms so that the workers would be
3 protected.
4

QUESTION*

Well, isn’t every indication that the

5 sole and exclusive benefit provision in the legislation was
6 to prevent the union officials from using the trust funds
7 for their own benefit?

Isn’t that really the thrust of the

8 legislative history?
9

MR. SWORD:

The sole and exclusive benefit language

10 shows that Congress wanted these funds to be used for the
11 benefit of the workers, and not for the benefit of the union.
12

QUESTION;

13

MR. SWORD;

Right.
We contend that the evidence in this

14 case shows one example of, if there is no judicial review,
15 of what the trust -- how the trust could be used to further
16 union benefits, because it is clear in the negotiations in
17 this case that the collective bargainers were not concerned
18 with the merits of any of the classes.

They were not

19 concerned with -- As a matter of fact, they did not even

20 consider our class, but instead the union was insisting upon
21 one group's inclusion, because they were concerned that
22 there was a vocal group which wanted benefits for a certain
23 group, and they considered that group a no compromise item
24 because of that vocal group.

25

For instance, there was one memorandum which was
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

drawn up during the negotiations in which -- concerning -- I

2 think this is just an example — benefits for widows of
3 active miners regardless of years of service, and they say,
4 "UMWA sees no compromise possible here, views this as
5 potentially dangerous post-ratification issue, especially in
6 southern West Virginia."

And the importance of that is that

7 there were certain groups, the union was concerned that
8 there could be wildcat strikes or other things which would
9 embarrass the union, and so the -10

QUESTION;

11 too, isn't there?

Well, there is another reason for that,
The people involved here were people

12 whose husbands had died before the negotiation took place,
13 so that I think it would be normal for the union to show a
14 greater interest in the current work force.

There would be

15 no obligation at all to provide retroactive benefits for
16 people who previously died, would there?

The arbitrariness

17 comes in that they provided benefits for some but not all.
18

MR. SWORD*

Yes.

We are not challenging the fact

19 that there were benefits provided to the widows of miners
20 who would be working in the future.
21

QUESTION*

But would you not agree that they could

22 have — if they had denied benefits for all widows of
23 previously deceased miners, you would have no case.
24

MR. SWORD*

We would have a case if they were

25 granting, as they did in this provision, benefits to the

We contend that that would not be

that the distinctions between the persons who

7 receive benefits and the persons who are denied benefits
8 must be drawn on a rational

basis.

If benefits are going to

9 be denied persons with massive contributory work histories,
10 with many years of

working in contributory employment, while

11

at the same time they are granting it to persons with lesser

12

work histories, there must be a rational nexus shown.

MR. SWORD;

Well, the cases have shown that the

of money is not a justification.

If so, any

20 restriction, regardless of how arbitrary, would be justified.
21

It is also interesting to note that after the

22 various court cases which have held

that there is judicial

23 review of eligibility provisions. Congress did enact ERISA,
24 and

ERISA was enacted at a time when it was well established

25 that there was

judicial review of eligibility provisions
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 which were formulated by trustees, and yet ERISA left
2 Section 302(c)(5) in effect and ERISA in effect codified and
3 strengthened sole and exclusive benefit standard which the
4 courts have interpreted under 302(c)(5) to prohibit this
5 type of arbitrary and capricious provisions.
6

The Congress was concerned in enacting 302(c)(5)

7 with the fact that workers’ contributions could be subject
8 to union manipulations, and the evidence in this case shows
9 that that indeed is a possibility whenever the negotiators
10 are involved in this area, and the protection is the
11 judicial review.

The trustees* position that these rules

12 are unreviewable and do not have to bear a rational nexus to
13 a valid purpose of a 302 fund, their position would open the
14 door to union manipulations of these funds, would allow the
15 unions to accomplish at the bargaining table what would be
16 unlawful for them to accomplish as trustees, and it would
17 leave retirees and widows totally unprotected for under the

18 trustees' argument these eligibility provisions could be
19 drawn not for the benefit of the workers, but to further the

20 benefit of the union.
21

The collective bargaining of a provision does not

22 afford any of the protections to an active worker which is
23 required under Section 302(c)(5).
24

The trustees' argument concerning Allied Chemical

25 Workers is not correct, because this case does not involve a

21

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

situation where the parties were being forced to bargain to

2 impasse.

The collective bargainers in this case freely

3 undertook to create a Section 302 trust.

We contend that

4 when they created that 302 trust, they created a creature of
5 federal law, and that trust must comply with federal law.
6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SWORD;

Why do you sue the trustees, though?
Under ERISA, suit can be brought

8 against the trustees, and also under the very trust -9

QUESTION;

Well, I know that solves your case for

10 you very easily, but the people who are at fault are the
11 settlors.

The union and the management.

Now, you may have

12 a right under 302 to have the fairness of the collective
13 bargaining agreement adjudicated, but I don't know why you
14 sue the trustees.

What authority do they have to say they

15 won't enforce the -- or maybe the trustees could even have
16 sued the settlors.
17

MR. SWORD;

That's correct, Justice White.

We feel

18 that the trustees in this situation could have sued to ask
19 for a declaratory judgment.
20

QUESTION;

Why didn't you sue the union and the

21 management to have their agreement declared illegal under
22 federal law?
23

MR. SWORD:

The very wage agreement in this case

24 and the trust documents themselves, Justice White, both
25 provide that the trustees are to reform these trusts to

1

MR. SWORD;

The district court found that the

2 provision in the contract and a provision in the trust
3 document both provided that the trustees were empowered to
4 change this trust document if it was shown that the
5 exclusion of this class was arbitrary and capricious.
6

QUESTION*

7

MR. SWORD;

Shown where?
If a court determined that the

8 exclusion was arbitrary and capricious, the trustees were to
9 change the documents.
10

QUESTION;

But the district judge thought

11 otherwise, didn’t he?
12

MR. SWORD;

The district judge concluded that based

13 on the fact that it was collectively bargained, that
14 therefore we were not entitled to relief.
15

QUESTION;

He said, bad bargain or not, it is a

16 bargain, didn't he?
17

MR. SWORD;

He said that this provision was the

18 result of collective bargaining, and so therefore it was -19

QUESTION;

20

MR. SWORD;

Yes, and good or bad, it was a contract.
That is what the district court found,

21 and that is the incorrect standard to apply to a Section 302
22 trust.

The judicial review which is normally applied to

23 collectively bargained contracts is a limited judicial
24 review.

The review is normally applicable to cases in which

25 you are dealing with issues which are relevant to active
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employees.

Row, the active employee has many remedies and

2 many protections.

The active employee has NLRB protections,

3 is afforded a duty to fair representation, has a voice in
4 the union, has a vote in the contract, and yet the retiree
5 or their survivor has none of these protections.
6

For the respondents' class, the only protection is

7 the requirement in Section 302, and the requirement in the
8 case law that these eligibility provisions not be drawn in
9 an arbitrary and capricious manner.

The testimony shows

10 that the collective bargainers did not even consider the
11 fact that there were men who were age eligible and years of
12 service eligible to retire, but who had not retired and
13 filed applications for pensions because they had continued
14 working past retirement age in contributory employment, and
15 had died while still actively employed.

There was no good

16 faith, active, intense bargaining as to our group.

There

17 was no consideration of the cost of our group or of their
18 merits.
19

The union negotiator, one of the union negotiators,

20 Mr. Pearce, noted that there was no tradeoff, and that the
21 respondents' class was omitted not on the merits.

As we

22 mentioned, the reason that our class was omitted was because
23 they were not considered.

The union only considered the

24 vocal class that the union thought would embarrass the union
25 after ratification of the contract, and when the bargaining
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 stopped, our class was left out for no reason whatsoever.
2

The trustees' position, if adopted, would mean that

3 any provision, regardless of how arbitrary, could be
4 readopted by the collective bargainers, and then there would
5 be judicial immunity.

For instance, the signatory last

6 employment requirement, which the defendant funds had, and
7 which was invalidated in Roark v. Boyle and Roark v. Lewis,
8 if the trustees in those cases had simply gone to the
9 collective bargainers and said, the court says this
10 provision is arbitrary, under their theory, the collective
11 bargainers could say, we, the collective bargainers, think
12 this is a good provision, and therefore the courts would
13 have no review whatsoever.
14

We contend that that position is not supported in

15 the case law, that that total abdication of their fiduciary
16 duties was not envisioned by Congress when it enacted
17 302(c)(5), was not envisioned by Congress when it enacted
18 ERISA, and that there is absolutely no support for that
19 position.
20

The trustees' argument that the cases holding that

21 302 places restrictions on trust funds have mistakenly
22 relied on general equity law is not supported from a reading
23 of the numerous cases from all of the circuits.

It is clear

24 that the courts have held that Section 302, because of the
25 fact that Congress was concerned that those persons who have
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 worked in contributory employment receive benefits, the
2 courts have held that 302 does supply substantive
3 restrictions on the plans themselves.
4

The trustees, of course, do not argue that

5 collective bargaining imposed any protections on this class,
6 and they have not shown any way in which judicial review
7 would harm collective bargaining.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Could I ask you a question?

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. CALVIN GOLUMBIC, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

14

MR. GOLUMBIC;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Suppose the union and management in the

16 collective bargaining agreement had some racial
17 discrimination, limited the benefits to all blacks or all
18 whites.

Would that be reviewable anywhere in the federal

19 law?
20

MR. GOLUMBIC;

It would, Justice White, pursuant to

21 this Court's decision in Steel and in Howard, as a violation
22 of possibly statutory basis upon which the collective
23 bargaining was undertaken, such as the Railway Labor Act, or
24 it might be in violation or Title VII, or it may very well
25 be a constitutional violation.

representation?

MR. GOLUMBIC;

4

under Title VII and -QUESTION;

5

6
7

The right to fair representation

But you say 302 would have no relevance

to it?
MR. GOLUMBIC;

Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act

8

would merely require that benefits be paid to contributing

9

employees, or to employees of contributing employers.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. GOLUMBIC;

12

13
14
15

All of them?
Not at all.

Not at all.

In fact,

let me address my response -QUESTION;

So your answer is, there is no 302

remedy for a situation like that?
MR. GOLUMBIC;

That is your submission?

That’s correct.

In fact, if the

16

Court will permit me in a few words to expand upon my

17

response to your question, in this instance the exclusion of

18

the widows from lifetime health care was undertaken in good

19

faith collective bargaining, and the economic wisdom and

20

judgment of the collective bargaining parties in making that

21

exclusion is not normally subject to review.

22

Absent a violation of federal law, as you pointed

23

out, Justice White, in this instance, there was no such

24

violation of federal law, although the court, the trial

25

court decided it was a violation of Section 302(c)(5) of the
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Taft-Hartley Act, and Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley

2 Act merely requires that benefits not be paid to individuals
3 who are not employees of contributing employers.

It does

4 not impose a duty upon the collective bargaining parties to
5 pay a benefit to any particular group of employees of
6 contributing employers.
7

Interestingly enough, the respondents argue that

8 notwithstanding the fact that the agreement was established
9 in good faith collective bargaining, the trustees have a
10 duty to modify that agreement to make it more equitable.
11 And may I point out to this Court that the trustees have no
12 authority under Section 8 of the National Labor Relations
13 Act to negotiate, and indeed, under Section 406 of ERISA,
14 they are prohibited from acting on behalf of the collective
15 bargaining parties, and to that extent the trustees may not
16 negotiate benefit modifications that were raised in
17 collective bargaining, and they may not negotiate those
18 benefit modifications to the collective bargaining
19 agreement, and try to give effect to benefit proposals that

20 were advanced and rejected during the collective bargaining
21 procedures.
22

To the contrary, to the contrary, the trustees

23 under Section 404(a)(1) of D of ERISA must comply and
24 administer the wage agreement consistent with its terms, and

25 solely for the benefit of the beneficiaries designated
