CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Beal, I think you may proceed whenever you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN E. BEAL, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. BEAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this is an income tax case involving a

11

commonly used estate planning device called a net gift.

12

The issue presented is whether or not the donor of a

13

gift made subject to the condition that the donee pay

14

the resulting gift taxes realizes taxable gain to the

15

extent the gift taxes paid by the donee exceed the

16

donor's adjusted basis in the property transferred.

17

For the purposes of our brief and in this

18

argument, I will define a net gift as a transfer by gift

19

of property subject to a condition that the donee make

20

payment of the resulting gift taxes.

21

does not refer to any other conveyance of property

22

subject to an indebtedness or an obligation.

23

obligation assumed by the donee is the discharge of the

24

gift taxes.

25

The term net gift

the two cases, and I will state the facts with reference

10

There are no material factual variances between

to that particular case.
In 1970 and 1971, Frances G. Grant made

separate gifts of BMA Corporation securities to her son,

subject to the condition that he pay the resulting gift

approximately $1 million, and the total gift taxes

involved on the transfers was $232,000.

that the transfers, the net gift transfers that she had

made resulted in a taxable gain in that they constituted

a part sale and part gift transfer, that she was

2

entitled to capital gain treatment on the transaction,

3

and that her gain was the difference between the gift

4

taxes paid of $232,000 and her basis of $9,000, or

5

approximately a $223,000 capital gain.
Her taxable income was increased by $110,000,

6
7

and an additional $70,000 or so of income taxes were

8

assessed against her.
QUESTION;

9

Suppose at the time of the gift,

10

Mr. Beal, the father said, here's this gift I am going

11

to give you, and with gifts of that size he is likely to

12

have very good legal counsel, and he says to his son,

13

our lawyers tell us the gift tax on this is going to be

14

$232,000 or whatever, and in addition to the gift, here

15

is a check for $232,000 to pay the gift tax when it

16

comes due.

What about that?
MR. BEAL;

17

In that instance, Your Honor, there

18

would be a gift of $232,000 of corporate securities, and

19

there would be an additional gift -- I'm sorry.

20

would be a gift of corporate securities of whatever

21

value, and there would be an additional gift of the

22

$232,000.

23
24
25

There

The using —
QUESTION;

What is the legal difference

between the hypothetical and the case before us?
MR. BEAL;

Well, in -- I don't believe there
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is any difference.

The using of the $232,000 in cash by

2

the donee to pay off the gift taxes wouldn’t, I don’t

3

think, even under the Commissioner's theory, result in

4

any income tax consequences to the donor.

5

the instance where adequate cash to pay off the gift

6

taxes is not transferred that the government asserts

7

that there has been an income tax consequence incurred

8

on the gift.

It is only in

9

If we had $1 million of cash paid over subject

10

to that same condition, without question, there would be

11

no assertion of an income tax consequence, and in our

12

view, it is not because there is no gain to the taxpayer

13

upon the transfer of the money, but it is simply because

14

it was not a taxable transaction from an income tax

15

standpoint to start with.

16

Preliminarily, I would like to point out that

17

the Tax Court in both cases specifically found that the

18

aggregate of the property in Mrs. Grant's case, the

19

$90,000, was conveyed to her son by gift.

20

finding is included in the record.

That factual

The finding was made by the court in ruling

The government's contention is that the intent

24

of Mrs. Grant to make or not make a gift is completely

25

beside the point, and that in effect a rule of law must

1

be imposed that when the gift taxes are discharged by

2

the donee without regard to the other circumstances, an

3

income tax may be payable.

4

The net gift transfer as it relates to income

5

tax consequences came up in the court of appeals for the

6

first time in 1969, in a decision by the Sixth Circuit,

7

Turner versus Commissioner.

8

gifts had been made on a net basis into trusts, and also

9

outright to an individual, and the Commissioner conceded

In that particular case,

10

that the transfers to the trusts were not part sale

11

transactions, but asserted that the gifts to the

12

individuals were part sales and partly in gift, and

13

attempted to assess an income tax on the payment of the

14

gift taxes by the individual.

15

for the taxpayer in that particular case.

16

The Sixth Circuit found

The next decision from the courts of appeals

17

was Estate of Davis versus Commissioner, decided by the

18

Fifth Circuit in 1974.

19

was part gift, part sale, and again it was rejected by

20

the Tax Court, and the Tax Court’s decision was affirmed

21

on a procurium by the Fifth Circuit.

22

Again, the Commissioner’s theory

The next decision in the courts of appeals was

23

rendered by the Fourth Circuit in 1978, in Hirst v.

24

Commissioner.

25

initially decided the issue in favor of the government.

A three-judge panel of the court

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

A motion for rehearing was filed, granted, and in a four

2

to three decision the Fourth Circuit again determined

3

that there was no net gift -- there was no income tax

4

consequence to the donor of a net gift.

5

that case was written for the majority by Chief Judge

6

Hainesworth.

The decision in

The Diedrich decision, which is the case

7
8

before us, is the first instance in which a court has

9

found that the net gift transfer results in an income

10

tax consequence -- results in a taxable gain upon the

11

payment of the gift taxes.
There has been a subsequent ruling made by the

12

13

Sixth Circuit in Owen v. Commissioner.

14

instance, a three-judge panel found for the taxpayer on

15

the basis of the Turner decision by the Sixth Circuit

16

earlier.

17

granted, and the opinion has been vacated, and that case

18

along with several others are being held in abeyance by

19

the Sixth Circuit pending a decision in this case.

A motion for rehearing in that case was

QUESTION*

Mr. Beal, would you agree with the

21

Solicitor General that for some 25 years the

22

Commissioner has consistently said that such a

23

transaction is subject to income tax —

24
25

MB. BEAL*

No, I do not.

In 1953, Estate of

Staley was tried, I believe in the Fifth Circuit, and in
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that particular case, property had been transferred into

2

a trust with a reservation by the donor of sufficient

3

income to pay the gift taxes.

4

that he had retained an income interest in the trust

5

that was taxable to him under the trust provisions of

6

the Internal Revenue Code as ordinary income.

7

taxpayer, on the other hand, said, I did not retain an

8

income interest in that trust, I made a sale in part of

9

the property into the trust, exactly the theory that is

The Commissioner asserted

The

10

now the basis of the claim in this case.

And the

11

government opposed that theory, and it was decided that

12

the part gift, part sale rationale did not apply.

13

In 1957, the --

14

QUESTION;

What case was that?

15

MR. EEAL;

That was Estate of Davis.

16

QUESTION;

Davis, yes.

17

MR. BEAL;

No, I am sorry. Estate of Staley.

18

QUESTION;

Staley.

19

MR. BEAL;

And I don't have the cite.

20
21
22
23

Staley.
I can

give it to you -QUESTION;

No, that's all right.

What is the

next one you were going to talk about?
MR. BEAL;

The next one that I am going to

24

refer to is a revenue ruling by the Commissioner which

25

is cited in the amicus brief, Revenue Ruling 57-564, and
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in that instance, the Commissioner himself responded to

2

the following request.

3

respect to the federal income tax consequences to a

4

donor pursuant to a trust instrument requiring the donee

5

to pay the federal gift tax on a gift of such stock.

6

was replying to a request for an opinion on the federal

7

income tax consequences.

8

9

Advice has been requested with

Again the Commissioner ruled that there was a
retention under these circumstances of an income

10

interest which was taxable, and there is no suggestion

11

whatsoever that there is another tax consequence, that

12

there is perhaps also or in lieu of the reservation of

13

an interest a capital gain consequence.

14

He

In the Turner case itself, the Commissioner

15

made the part gift, part sale argument, and insofar as

16

we can tell, I was able to check, there was no petition

17

for cert filed requesting a review of that decision.

18

QUESTION*

Let me ask you about my

19

understanding of the present situation.

20

pays the gift tax, the amount that the donee pays for

21

the tax is added onto the basis of the property in the

22

hands of the donee.

Is that correct?

23

MR. BEAL;

That is correct.

24

QUESTION;

And to that extent no capital gains

25

If the donee

tax or other income tax would ever be levied on that

1

incremental add-on to the basis.

2

ME. BEALi

That is correct.

3

QUESTIONS

Okay.

4

the donor pays the gift tax?

5

to the donee's basis when the donee gets it?
MR. BEAL*

6

What is the consequence if
Is that same amount added

Yes, it is.

The stepup in basis

7

for the amount of gift taxes paid occurs in both

8

instances.

9

QUESTION*

Yes.

10

QUESTION*

But Mr. Beal, the stepup occurs,

11

but isn't it true that in your case — what is the

12

basis?

13

basis in the donee's hands of the — in this case?

I will ask you.

MR. BEAL*

14

What do you understand the

In our case, the basis of the stock

15

in the donee's hands would be the donor's basis

16

increased by the amount of the gift taxes.
QUESTION*

17
18

So in other words it would be

$9,000 plus $232,000.

19

MR. BEAL*

That's correct.

20

QUESTION;

Under the government's view, as I

21

understand it, it is 232 plus another 232.

22

right?

Is that

23

MR. BEAL*

That's correct.

24

QUESTION*

So there's a difference between you

25

as to -- between the two of you as to what the proper

5

basis is in the donee's hands.
HR. BEAL;

Right, and that is because the

government wants to -QUESTION;

Because they treat that as a sale

to the extent of 232.

6

MR. BEAL;

Exactly.

7

QUESTION;

And then -- but you agree that

8

under their view, you get both the 232 as purchase price

9

plus the 232 in the form of gift tax.

10

MR. BEAL;

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

11

QUESTION;

I understand.

12

QUESTION;

Counsel, be sure to stay as near to

13

the microphones as you can.

14

MR. BEAL;

I am sorry.

15

I want to at this point -- I had better make

16

another point before I slip by it.

17

the government of the part gift, part sale rationale,

18

and in all fairness, the government no longer makes that

19

contention.

20

essence of the transaction is a sale in part of the

21

securities but claims that the payment of the gift

22

taxes, that particular aspect of the transaction is the

23

taxable event for federal income tax purposes.

24
25

I have been accusing

The government no longer asserts that the

Re have a potential, it seems to me, of three
points in time at which we could find there to be a

1

taxable eventi

when the agreement is made, when the

2

condition is imposed and the donee says, I agree to

3

that; when the property itself is conveyed subject to

4

the obligation to pay the gift taxes; or at the time of

5

payment of the gift taxes, and it is this latter point

6

in time that the government now asserts results in a

7

gift tax -- or an income tax consequence, based upon the

8

decision of this Court in Old Colony, in Old Colony

9

Trust Company versus Commissioner in 1929, in which the

10

payment of an individual’s income tax by his employer

11

was found to be additional compensation.

12

QUESTION;

And straight income.

13

MR. BEAL;

Yes.

Ordinary income to him, just

14

as though his salary had been paid -- in fact, his

15

salary was partly paid in the form of money paid over to

16

the Treasury.

17
18
19

QUESTION;

Why shouldn't that have been the

result here, under the government's theory?
MR. BEAL;

Because in that -- in the Old

20

Colony case, there is a taxable transaction for income

21

tax purposes.

22

only is that the manner in which the compensation is

23

paid is immaterial.

24

submit that there has not been —

25

And the decision in that — in that case

QUESTION;

In this particular instance, we

somebody’s obligation results in income.

3

That is

4

MR. BEAL*

I -- I —

5

QUESTION:

Why shouldn’t it be ordinary income?

6

MR. BEAL;

The government’s theory that it is

7

not ordinary income is that it is a gain from dealing in

8

property, and therefore subject to the favorable

9

treatment of capital gains --

10

QUESTION*

Well, then, what if it were cash?

11

MR. BEAL*

Oh, if it were cash, the government

12

would let us go free, without —

MR. BEAL*

The statement --

MR. BEAL;

Mr. Smith would have the answer to

QUESTION;

Well, I will have to ask Mr. — I

that.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

will ask Hr. Smith.

He is very good at explaining it.

2

MR. BEAL:

In his brief, he only states that

3

it is tantamount to giving the tax money to the taxpayer

4

and having him tender it, which is tantamount to the

5

same transaction we are dealing with.
QUESTION:

6

I would like to --

Hr. Halter, normally when a person

7

is said to realize a taxable gain, when someone else

8

pays off his debt or discharges his liabilities, now,

9

how does this differ from that?

10

MR. BEAL:

Okay.

11

QUESTION:

Except that you have the Turner

12

case and its progeny.

13

ruled on that.
MR. BEAL:

14

However, this Court has never

The discharge of indebtedness in

15

connection with a transfer of property really is based

16

upon Crane versus Commissioner, in which a sale of

17

property was made subject to a non-recourse mortgage,

18

and the taxpayer received some boot.

19

held in that case that the mortgage which was on the

20

property at the time she acquired it was not deducted in

21

determining her basis in the property.

The Supreme Court

Under federal estate tax law, she had a fair

22

23

market value basis.

The mortgage that it was subject to

24

was not deducted, so she had a basis of $260,000

25

roughly.

When she conveyed that property to another
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

person in a sale transaction, the government asserted

2

and the court found that the basis — I'm sorry, that

3

the non-recourse indebtedness was a part of what she

4

received.

5

The difference between the cases is this.

6

Number One, there has been in the mortgage encumbrance

7

case, the pre-existing indebtedness case, a realization

8

by the taxpayer of a portion of the value of the

9

property which the taxpayer is free to use or do with as

10

he or she pleases.

11

a pre-existing obligation, and there never is an

12

instance in which the taxpayer has a right to receive

13

any cash to do with as the taxpayer pleases.

14

In the net gift case, there never is

When you encumber property, you in effect

15

withdraw a portion of the value of that property, and

16

the cash that you get in that manner can be used for

17

whatever purpose you choose.

18

difference between the Crane type transaction and the

19

net gift involved here.

20

QUESTION:

That in our opinion is the

If the donee were to pay the amount

21

of the gift tax plus $100, how should that $100

22

additional amount be treated for tax purposes?

23

ME. BEAL:

That would clearly be a taxable

24

amount to the party.

That has -- the receipt of that

25

consideration would represent a conversion of that asset

presumably?

4

HR. BEAL;

Yes, it would be.

5

QUESTION;

Could you tell me why would a donor

6

structure his gift this way rather than himself making a

7

net gift?

8

the amount of $1 million, and he says the gift tax on

9

this is going to be $200,000, so I will give the donee

Say he is thinking of depleting his estate by

10

$800,000 and pay the tax.

Now, why does he not do it

11

that way rather than give the donee $1 million and ask

12

him to pay the tax?

3

MR. BEAL;

Two reasons.

4

QUESTION ;

Yes .

5

MR. BEAL4

The first reason, and the one that

6

applies in the Grant case, is that the donor does not

7

have sufficient cash to pay the gift taxes herself, and

8

she did not want to make a sale.

The family as a unit -

9

QUESTION;

Why didn't she want to make a sale?

20

MR. BEAL;

Because the --

21

QUESTION;

Because it would precipitate some

22

capital gains tax?
MR. BEAL;

23

Well, that is not true in the Grant

The second reason is that if a sale

MR. BEAL;

It is just a — it’s a b racket

Exactly right/ and the problem that

I have just — that you point out is true o f an ordinary

gift.

6

QUESTION;

Yes.

7

MR. BEAL;

If the donor has enoug h cash to pay

8

the tax and gives the stock to a donee who immediately

9

sells it, with the exception of trusts, whi ch are under

10

a certain -- a separate rule, they get the advantage of

11

the lower tax bracket.

12
13
14

QUESTION;

Well, isn’t there a ne w statute

that limits the bracket advantage?
MR. BEAL;

For trusts.

For trans fers into

15

trusts and sales which are made within two years after

16

the transfer has been made, they in effect tax those as

17

though the sale had been made by the donor.

MR. BEAL;

No, not in an outright -- not in a

MR. BEAL;

advantage.
I would like to give two examples, very

3

quickly, on how this would operate in practice.

4

assume that we have two taxpayers, A and B, each with $1

5

million in corporate securities which they want to

6

transfer to their sons, who are running the businesses,

7

as was the case in Grant; that Taxpayer A has a $300,000

8

basis in the property, and Taxpayer B has a $100,000

9

basis in the property; and that the taxes, the gift

10
11

Let's

taxes imposed in each instance are $200,000.
Under the government’s theory of taxation in

12

this case, Taxpayer A, who has a $100,000 basis in that

13

property, realizes a $100,000 capital gain, the

14

difference between the $200,000 gift taxes paid by the

15

donee and her $100,000 basis in the stock.

16

Taxpayer B, who has a $300,000 basis, realizes

17

a $100,000 capital loss as a result of that transaction,

18

which may or may not be recognizable through her return,

19

but nevertheless it is a realized loss.

20

He submit that there is no policy of the

21

Internal Revenue Code or the gift tax laws that dictates

22

that that result should occur with two taxpayers who

23

have exactly the same motivation for entering into the

24

transaction.

25

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1

MR. SMITH:

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

please the Court, the question presented in this case

4

involves, as Mr. Beal has pointed out, the income tax

5

consequences to the donor of a gift of low basis

6

property on the condition that the donee pay the

7

resulting gift tax.

8

question implicates a fundamental principle of tax law

9

deriving from both the statute and this Court’s

10

In our view of the matter, the

decisions.

11

Let me refer the Court, if I may, to Section

12

1001 of the Code, which is set forth at Page 5a of the

13

appendix to our brief.

14

computation of gain or loss as, "The gain from the sale

15

or other disposition of property shall be the excess of

16

the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis,"

17

et cetera, and Section — Subsection (b) of that section

18

says, "The amount realized from the sale or other

19

disposition of property shall be the sum of any money

20

received plus the fair market value of the property

21

other than money received."

22

Subsection (a) defines the

Now, this is very fancy statutory language for

23

the very obvious proposition that if you buy something

24

for a dollar and you sell it for $1,000, your $1,000 is

25

your amount realized under Subsection (b) and your basis
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is a dollar, and therefore your gain under Subsection

2

(a) is $999.

3

Now, this case, in our view, is really nothing

4

more than that transaction dressed up in lawyers'

5

language.

6

which -- for which they paid a very small amount.

7

was family corporation stock.

8

just a dollar a share, and in the other case it was also

9

a very small amount.

10

Here the taxpayers in both cases had property
It

In one case the basis was

11

their bounty, children, what have you, and as the Court

12

knows from the recent opinion yesterday, there is a gift

13

tax that complements the estate tax.

14

tax due, and the Code is very precise that the

15

obligation to pay the gift tax is on the donor.

16

So there is a gift

Section 2502(d), which is set forth at Page 8a

17

of our appendix, says very explicitly, "The tax imposed

18

by Section 2501" -- that's the gift tax -- "shall be

19

paid by the donor."

20

these cases, the taxpayers, had a gift tax obligation.

21

Now, how is it — how is it arranged?

22

that the transfer would be made on the condition that

23

the donees would pay the resulting gift taxes.

So the donors in this case, in

It was arranged

24

Now, in our view, this payment of the gift tax

25

by the donees is an amount realized just as if the -- in

economic terms, the donors sold the property to the

2

donees for the amount of the gift taxes, because indeed

3

it -- these transfers were made on the condition — that

4

is very important here, that they were made on the

5

condition that the donees pay the gift taxes, and in

6

fact, really explains Justice White's query as to why

7

these -- why this amount is tied in with sale or

exchange.

Well -When there is money, and he says to

the donee, please pay the tax, and he does, and

MR. SMITH*

He is, but the view of the

transaction -- these transactions that has been

developed by the Commissioner over the year -- over the

6

years, and indeed it is for a very long time -- We take

9

issue with Mr. Beal's protestation that this is some new

10

development.

11

the view is that the consideration for the transfer was

12

the payment of the gift tax.

13

This is really an old development.

But

Now, indeed, if I were to say, if the

14

transaction would be A just gives the money, gives the

15

stock to B, and then later on there is this gift tax,

would be no income if the donee — if the donee -- if

the donor, excuse me, gives the donee a sum of money and

The basis in cash.
The basis in cash is just -Just the amount of the cash.
— is just the amount of the

The way we view this transaction, and I think it

15

is quite appropriate in statutory terms, is that A

16

decides to give appreciated stock to B on the condition

17

that B pay his gift taxes.

18

please pay my grocer, and B then dutifully says, well,

19

how much is it, and it is $200,000, and that's an amount

20

realized on the transfer, and that has to be netted out

against the donor's basis in the property, and that is

amount of the gift taxes.

I think it is a sound view of the

This is

Now --

Mr. Smith, do you concede, though,

12

that the intent of the donors in these cases was to make

13

a gift, not a sale?
MB. SMITH:

14

Yes, I am sure that the intent of

15

the donors here was to make a gift, but in our view,

16

that intent is irrelevant.

17

economic consequences of the transaction have to be

18

viewed objectively.

19

quite succinctly in a way that the court of appeals has

20

quoted.

21

gift does not alter the fact that despite the

22

transferor's intention, he is actually transferring the

23

entire property and receiving something in return.

24

intent that the transferee receive only a portion of the

25

value of the property cannot eliminate that essential

2

In our view, subjective intent is simply not

3

relevant here, and I think that -- you know, that kind

4

of argument is well known to this Court's jurisprudence.

5

As long ago as 22 years ago, really, in Commissioner

6

versus Duberstein, a celebrated tax case, the Court

7

said, it scarcely needs adding that the parties'

8

expectations or hopes as to the tax treatment of their

9

conduct in themselves have nothing to do with the

10
11

matter, and in our view —
QUESTION*

But that is not the same question

12

as the parties* intent in engaging in the transaction

16

QUESTION;

17
18

I mean, one can

Oh, sure, sure, sure.
-- quite apart from one's

expectations -MR. SMITH*

But I think that in this

19

particular case, to say that, well, gee, all I wanted to

20

do was to give a gift, and I didn't think that I was

21

going to have to have income tax consequences, I didn't

22

think of this as an income taxable transaction, I think

23

that that is a level of unsophistication that really

24

just doesn't wash with respect to -- I mean, I don’t

25

think that has any relevance in determining what the

1

2

income tax consequences are of the transaction.
I suspect that Mrs. Crane in the Crane case

3

had no idea when she stepped away from her house for a

4

very small amount of cash and had the buyer assume a

5

mortgage, and she really didn't have very much, that she

6

in fact wound up having really a large taxable gain.

7

It's the same sort of thing.

8

I mean, one can only think of a case that this

9

Court had several years ago, Commissioner versus Gordon,

10

which involved a very complicated spinoff transaction,

11

in which the court of appeals had analyzed it in much

12

those terms.

13

of paper in one corporation, and then they had them in

14

another, and nothing really very much happened, and this

15

Court very sharply said that these are statutory

16

questions that have to be -- these transactions have to

17

be measured against statutory language.

18

Well, gee, you know, they just had pieces

And here, in our view, the concept of amount

19

realized, and here, you have a transaction in which

20

there is a transfer of property with a low basis for an

21

amount realized which is as real as anything.

22

the donor's gift taxes in this -- in these cases is a --

of the consideration on the transfer.

10

MR. SMITH:

Like all of us.
Perhaps the answer is that the

12

Commissioner's duty is to collect taxes, wherever he can

13

get them.

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, that -- that is -- that is

15

true, but I think there -- there are explanations as to

16

why the -- why the Tax Court has gone astray here.

17

you examine the Turner case, I think one of the things

18

that plagued the decision in that case was the

19

Commissioner's quite unwise conception that the

20

transfers to the trust in those cases didn't produce

21

gain, but that the transfers to the individual donees

22

did, and that involved quite a wrong theory that somehow

23

the trustees didn't have personal liability.

So

MR. SMITH;

It has been reflected in a long

string of rulings which we cite, since 1957, in our

brief, and it is also reflected in Section 1001-1(e) of

15

the regulations which we cite, which talk about

transfers of property and part sale and part gift.

MR. SMITH;

Well, Mr. Beal has -- Mr. Beal has

referred to another line of cases that we don't think

He has referred to a line of cases

We have won some of those cases and

2

the so-called grantor trust provisions of the Internal

3

Revenue Code, Sections 671 through 677, which deal with

4

situations under what conditions a grantor of a trust

5

can be charged with income taxes on the income of the

6

trust, and of course in those instances where we have

7

won those cases, the grantor has -- or the donor has

8

been charged with ordinary income, because in effect it

9

is -- he is deemed to be the owner of the trust’s income.
But those cases don't have — those cases

10
11

don’t signal any inconsistency.

In fact, they simply

reflect the Commissioner’s responding to the particular

13

kind of transaction.
Let me, if I may, you know, refer -- we quote

Raum wrote the opinion for the Tax Court, in which he

but he said at the end that if he were going to write on

24

a clean slate, they might really come out the other way

25

because of the torturous, myriad details of the

2

And he said, and I think with a good deal of

3

candor and sound analysis, "We recognize that there is

4

much force to the government's position.

5

8

the transferred property equal in value to the amount of

the gift tax is not treated as having been part of the

air, and a strong argument can be advanced for the

12

conclusion that it was exchanged for the donee's payment

13

of the gift tax on the net gift, a transaction that may

14

result in the realization of gain or loss depending upon

15

the donor's basis in the property."

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

HR. SMITH;

Whether the donor could take a

2

loss or not really depends upon other Code provisions.

3

While a loss might be realized in such a situation, not

4

every loss is deductible for income tax purposes.

5

may refer the Court to Section 165(c)(1) of the Code,

6

(c)1, 2, 3, which lists a number of losses, kinds of

7

losses that are not deductible.

8

were to sell your personal residence at a loss, it would

9

not be a deductible loss.

10

For example, if you

If I

Don't you

Under the regulation, there is --

14

the regulation flatly says that there is no loss, but

15

without going into that, I can simply say that in this

16

particular case there would be no loss, in these

17

particular cases, and in the typical net gift

transaction there would be no loss, because Section 267

19

of the Code provides for a number of situations of

intra-family transfers in which there is no loss.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN E. BEAL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

8

MR. BEAL:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

You

Thank you very much.

10

Court, I would like to hit a couple of things real fast.

11

The government is asking for a per se rule that any time

12

consideration is paid by a donee in connection with a

13

gift, the donor recognizes taxable gain to the extent

14

that consideration exceeds his adjusted basis in the

15

property .

16

Section 2512(d) of the gift tax code provides

17

that whenever property is transferred for less than an

18

adequate and full consideration in money or money's

19

worth, then the amount by which the value of the

20

property exceeded the value of the consideration shall

21

be deemed a gift.

22

case that the corollary to 2512(d) be judicially adopted.

23

The Commissioner is asking in this

Congress saw fit and saw a necessity to adopt

24

a specific provision making a part -- making a sale in

25

part a gift in an instance where there was less than
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

full consideration.

Congress did not see any necessity

2

to impose a similar income tax requirement in the

3

situation where a gift does involve some payment of

4

consideration by the donee.

5

If the -- if there was a necessity to adopt

6

2512(d) in the first instance, then there has to have

7

been a necessity, or it seems to us there is a necessity

8

for there to be a corollary code, corollary provision in

9

the Income Tax Code, and there is none.
Point Number Two.

10

There is no tax abuse

11

involved in these transactions.

The only thing that is

12

involved is a carryover basis which is a necessary part

13 of any gift transaction, and the -- and a potential for
14

deferral of capital gains or deferral of gain in the

15 hands of the donee, which is another integral part of a
16 gift transactions.

Those aspects of an ordinary gift

17 are the only instances in which there is "any tax gain"
18 off of these transactions.
The third thing I want to hit is the nature of

19
20

the gift tax itself.

The government, relying upon a

21

provision of the gift tax code, states that it is a

22

personal obligation of the donee.

The estate tax code

23 and the gift tax codes are in pari materia.
24

The

provisions -- the interpretations of one apply to the

25 other.

Tha gift tax -- the estate tax code imposes the

1

estate tax on the executor in language that is

2

substantially identical to the language in the gift tax

3

code, yet I don't think even the government would

4

contend that in an instance where most of the property

5

transfers through joint tenancies or through trust

6

estates outside the probate estate, that we would impose

7

an income tax consequence on the executor because the

8

recipient of the property in the joint tenancy situation

9

or as a recipient from a trust made payment of that

10

federal estate tax.

theory is exemplified by the Congressional enactment of
