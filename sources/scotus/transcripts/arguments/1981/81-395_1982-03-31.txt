ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H. GOTTESMAN, ESQ.

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOTTESMANt

At the 1978 convention of the Steelworkers

10

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Union — that is its highest governing body, including

12 several

thousand delegates selected by the members of

13 each of its locals

-- the Constitution of the union was

14 amended by adopting the rule that is at issue in this
15 case .

That rule forbids candidates and their

16

17 supporters -- candidates for office within
18 for high office within

the union,

the union -- from soliciting or

19 accepting campaign support from persons who are not
20 members of the union.

The purpose of the rule was to

21 assure that those who got elected to high office in the

22 union would be beholden only to the members of the
23 union, and not,
24 had

by virtue of the financial benefits they

received from outsiders, be beholden to those

25 outside rs.

2

The analogue in the federal statutes and with
respect to federal elections to the rule that the

3 steelworkers adopted is that provision which makes it
4 unlawful for any candidate for federal office to
5 solicit, accept or receive any contribution from a
6 foreign national.

7

The court below has held that the steelworkers

8 rule violates Section

101(a)(2) of the Landrum-Griffin

9 Act, a part of Title I of that statute.

We sought

10

review, and this Court granted a writ of certiorari to

11

review two questions:

first, whether that construction

12 of the Landrum-Griffin

Act is correct; and second, if it

13 is, whether the Landrum-Griffin Act as thus construed to
14 deprive the union and its members of the right to
15 insulate their elections from outsider involvement,
16 abridges the First Amendment freedom of association of
17 the union's members, by taking from them the power to
18 determine the appropriate standard of participation by
19 others in its elections.
20
21

I will talk first about the statutory
construction issue.

Whenever, as here, the question is

22 the legitimacy of a union’s election rule,

statutory

23 analysis properly begins — though, of course, it
24 doesn't end — with Title IV of the statute.

That is

25 the title, entitled elections, which lays down election

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

rules with respect to union elections
In that title, Congress prescribed a number of

3 rules to govern union elections, frequency of elections,
4 notice of elections and the like.

And one of the

5 subjects that Congress specifically focused on in Title
6 IV was the subject of campaign financing.

In Title IV,

7 Congress expressly provided that union monies and
8 employer monies could not be donated to any candidate in
9 a union election.

And in Title IV, Congress expressly

10 provided that every
11

member of the union would have the

right to provide campaign support to a candidate in a

12 union election.

13

Now, of course, there is a middle ground

14 between that which Congress expressly forbad and
15 which Congress expressly protected.

that

There are

16 non-members of the union whose capacity to contribute is
17 not addressed

on the face of Title IV.

But that does

18 not mean that Title IV has no relevance to that
19 question, because Congress in Title IV, having laid down
20 and mandated for unions certain
21

comply with in their elections, closed the circle; it

22 didn't stop
23

rules that they had to

with it.

It said, beyond the rules that we prescribe in

24 this title,

unions will be free to choose their own

25 election rules.

We have laid down certain minimum

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

requirements, and beyond this we expressly provide that

2 the choice as to any other othe election rules,

not

3 inconsistent with those that we, the Congress, have laid
4 down, rests with the members of the union through their
5 democratic processes.

That decision is reflected in two difference

6

7 places in Title IV.

First, in Section 403 which

8 provides that no labor organization shall be required by
9 law to conduct election of officers in any different
10

former manner than is required by its own constitution

11

and bylaws, except as otherwise provided by this title.

12 And

it is provided again in Section 401(e) which is one

13 of the provisions that lays down the rules unions must
14 obey.

And one of those rules is that the election shall

15 be conducted in accordance with the constitution and
16 bylaws of such organization, insofar as they are not
17 inconsistent with

the provisions of this title.

with his cooperation, they would violate the rule.

If

2 they got money from non-members in order to finance

3 activities of their own, independent of the candidate
4 although expressing their support for him,

that would

5 not be a violation of the union's rule.
In that sense, the distinction between

6

7 expenditure and contribution in the union's rule is
8 parallel to that in the federal statutes.

And indeed,

9 it is I think fairly obvious when you look at the union
10 rule and the way it is structured that those who drafted
11

it were not oblivious to the fact that some of these

12 same questions had

been considered and addressed in the

13 federal statute, and many of the lines are the same,
14 including the exception for volunteered personal time.
QUESTION;

15

Mr. Gottesman, has Section 27 of

16 the union constitution been amended at all since this
17 action was initiated?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

18

I was amended once and that

19 amendment is referred to in the court of appeals'
20 opinion.
21

22

The amendment does not relate to the issues

that are before the Court.
QUESTIONS

And there have been no further

23 amendments.
24

MR. GOTTESMAN;

That is correct.

There has

25 not been another union constitution since the rulings --

1

union convention — since the rulings below.

And the

2 next one is scheduled for this September.

QUESTION;

3

And does this Court have to address

4 the right to sue theory,

in your view?

MR. GOTTESMAN;

5

6 us that the

Well, if the Court agrees with

union rule does not violate 101(a)(2), it

7 has to address that only because respondents have
8 offered it as an alternative basis for invalidating the
9 entire rule.
10 appeals*
11

We did not seek review of the court of

holding that the rule violates that, because

implicit in that, in our view, would simply be an

12 injunction saying

don't apply your rule to litigation,

13 which is no problem for the union because we didn't
14 think it applied to litigation
15

in the first place.

But if the Court agrees with us that the rule

16 does not violate 101(a)(2),

that other provision comes

17 into play only in the sense that respondents are here
18 saying you should use that other provision to invalidate
19 the whole rule.

And therefore, in that sense, the Court

20 would possibly reach that

21 one
22

issue and have to decide it

way or the other.
QUESTION;

23 situation is this?

Mr. Gottesman, how common a

in which Tony Boyle

Beyond that, I personally am not, and the

6 record does not show -- it certainly had been the

It was George

Meany’s statement at that time that it was unprecedented

9 in the history of the AFL-CIO that any of its affiliates
10

had suffered an experience of an organized, concerted

11

outsider involvement such as had occurred in the 1977

12 steelworker election.

13

QUESTION:

Apart from this one, has there been

14 any serious challenge to the incumbency in

the

15 steelworkers?
16

MR. GOTTESMAN;

There have been, yes, three

17 prior ones.

The statement that

2 appears in their briefs that he was the first serious
3

challenger to an incumbent is, therefore, one that comes

4

with some surprise.

5

QUESTION:

I would assume, Nr. Gottesman, that

6

in evolving this rule, some consideration was given to

7

what has been the usual pattern through the public area,

8

the public sector, of requiring sworn statements

9

identifying all the contributors.

If every candidate

10

within the union was required to file a sworn statement,

11

with every contribution identifying the contributor and

12

forbidding a the process that would preclude any

13

anonymous contributions, would that not satisfy this

14

problem ?

HR. GOTTESMAN:

The judgment of the union was

16

that it would not, Your Honor, and the reasons are

explained in our reply brief.

And what happened was, the voters in that

They had a candidate that they would have

was going to be that they were going to have a

Now, it seems to me — and certainly it seemed

— that it is entitled to make the judgment

Now, the congressional scheme --

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION*

1

Mr. Gottesman, does the prohibition

2 in the Landrum-Griffin Act against contributions by

3 employers or unions apply only to the union which is
4 holding the election and only to an employer whose
5 employees are represented by the union?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

6

No, Your Honor, it applies to

7 any union and any officer of another union.

And the

8 defintion of employer, as construed by the Labor

9 Department and enforced by the Sixth Circuit, is so
10 broad
11

that would encompass about 80% of the people to

whom the union's rule is addressed anyway.

The Labor

12 Department's interpretation is that because the word

13 "employer" is not qualified by "interested" employer, as
14 it is in a different provision of the statute, it was
15 Congress' intent that anybody who is an employer within
16 the meaning — in interstate commerce, within the
17 meaning of the statute, even though he has no
18 involvement with this union, this union does not
19 represent his employees, he doesn't do business with
20 this union in any commercial sense — anybody who meets
21

the statutory defintion of an employer cannot

22 contribute.

And that includes any managing person

23 cannot make personal contributions.
24

So that a partner in a law firm, a dentist who

25 employs two assistants, the person who owns the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2346

1

neighborhood bar, all of those people under the Labor

2 Department’s regulation and the Sixth Circuit decision
3 are,

in any event, precluded from contributing.
QUESTION;

4

The term employer then is defined

5 independently of the,National Labor Relations Act,

6 whether they would

be subject to the National Labor

7 Relations Act and their

—

HR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

statute.

So it is

in essence, who employs one or more employees

And the court said that

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

his contribution was a violation of the statute.
So that what the union is doing is filling a

2
3

space that Congress in Title IV left open, but not such

4 a broad
5

space as perhaps is suggested by the briefs of

the respondent.
Now, in that Title IV scheme there is clear

6

7 evidence as
8

to why it is that Congress not only laid

down certain rules but also laid down the additional

9 provision that
10 free to
11

beyond these rules, the union shall be

adopt their own and make their own choices with

respect to election rules.

And what the legislation

12 shows is that Congress was struggling with two
13 objectives.
14

On the one hand, the McClellan hearings had

15 shown without doubt
16 unions,

and

that there were some undemocratic

that there were, in fact, certain statutory

17 necessities

that were going to be required if those

18 unions were

going to be made democratic and put back in

19 the hands of their union officers.
20 said we are

And so, Congress

going to lay down and mandate by federal law

21 those rules that we have determined are essential to the

22 achievement of union democracy, and those we have done
23 in Title IV.
24

But the other congressional concern is that we

25 do not intrude too far on

union autonomy.

This was,

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

after all, the first time that Congress had ever

2 legislated with respect to internal union affairs, and
3

the legislative reports are replete with statements —

4

we are dealing here with private associations.

5

enacting this statute, are tinkering with the mechanisms

We, by

6 by which the leadership of private associations are
7

selected, and in doing so, we want to act as limitedly

8 as we can.
9

We have defined certain evils; we will

mandate the correction of those evils.

Beyond that we

10

will not go.

And more, beyond that, we will make clear

11

that the choice will be for the union members of what

12

their rules will be beyond this.
More than that, the whole point of this

13
14

statute was to return the governance of unions to their

15

members, so the legislative history is replete with

16

statements -- we shouldn't go too far in legislating

17

rules of the unions, not only because we violate their

18

autonomy, but because we are unfaithful to the very

19

purpose of this statute.

The purpose of this statute is

20 we will create minimum standards that will be sufficient
21

to give the union back to its members.
And certainly the record in this case shows

22
23

that the steelworkers union is in the hands of its

24

members.

25

time, incumbents are removed at a rate equal if not

Candidates for office are defeated all the

exceeding that in federal elections.

And we will let

2 the members make choices on all the matters except those
3 that we have specifically dictated here.

And thus,

4
5 the
6

circle.

we have in Title IV the closing of

Certain rules laid down and a specific

mandate that beyond that, the choice is for the union

7 members and

it cannot be dictated by any provision

8 outside of Title IV.

QUESTION

9

Do you think the free speech

10 provision is constitutional, in
11

the sense that -- what

if there were a union rule that would purport to limit

12 free speech beyond

that which is guaranteed with a

13 statute?

Do you think that --

14

MR. GOTTESMAN:

15

QUESTION;

16 and

Oh, it would clearly --

Why would that be constitutional

this — I know your bottom line, at least one of

17 your bottom

lines is that if construed this way, this

18 provision at issue here would be unconstitutional.

MR. GOTTESMAN;

19

20 — I mean,
21

Right.

Sell, what we have got

the constitutional issue in any case is --

this is a private association, it has private

22 decision-making mechanisms, -23
24 just

QUESTION;

Well why couldn’t the union then

limit free speech beyond that which the statute

25 purports to

guarantee?

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

BP. GOTTESBAN;

1

At every stage the question is

2 whether there is a sufficient government justification
3 for the intrusion that it is making on the union
4 autonomy.

And I think there is a distinction in

5 measuring that between a rule whose function it is,

and

6 which is directly aimed at providing the decisionmaking
7 in the hands of the union’s members;

a rule that says

8 there must be elections, a rule that says there will be
9 notice of elections, a rule that says you will not
10 prevent candidates from voicing their views or other
11
12

members from voicing their views.
QUESTION;

Do you think the union has to hold

13 elections rather than,

say, appoint its officer by some

14 other method?
15

UR. GOTTESBAN;

Well, certainly

16 Landrum-Griffin says so, and certainly the First
17 Amendment argument that that would be an intrusion on
18 freedom of association I think would be a much harder
19 one than the one we have got here, because there the
20 governmental interest would be stated and there is a
21

closer nexus between the governmental interest than

22 there is here.
23

QUESTION;

Mr. Gottesman, you referred to a

24 distinction between contributions and expenditures.
25 Will you elaborate on that and suggest some examples of

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the distinction, the way it would operate?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

HR. GOTTESHAN;

That is right, there is no way

7 the union could stop outside expenditures.
8 only has jurisdiction over its members.

The union

All it can do

9 is say to its members you will not take money from
10 outsiders.
11

It cannot stop an outsider who wants to

spend money and not give it to a union member; it just

12 has not control, no jurisdiction over it.

Now turning to 101(a)(2), it has to be looked

13

14 at in the context, it seems to us, of what Title IV has
15 done.

And the question has to be — because this really

16 is the question — did Congress, when it wrote this
17 other title of the same statute, intend to overturn the
18 very decision that it made in Title IV, to leave all
19 other choices to the union members.
20
21

When you look at it, the first thing, the
first right it confers is the right to meet and assemble

22 freely with other members.

Now, that is the only place

23 in 101(a)(2) where the associational right is addressed,
24 and it is expressly and in terms confined to meeting
25 with other members.

24 you couldn't ask for more, sc Sadlowski would have to

Thank you. Your Honor.

There

We are told that what

20 the union did here is a terrible blow to democracy.

But

21 what the union did here is an expression of democracy.
22 There is no debate about the fairness of the union’s
23 convention.

Delegates elected by the members from all

24 over the country came, and overwhelmingly, by a ten to
25 one margin, said we want this rule.

reading Joint Appendix, 74.
MR. GOTTESMAN;

12

Yes, I am sorry. Your Honor, I

13

should have made that clearer, and I had forgotten that

provision.

15

The union does want the candidate to make such efforts

Your Honor, because I —

23

It is rather strongly worded, his

duty to stop that sort of thing.

20
21

The union cannot stop outside expenditure.

The union can't

And I apologize for having forgotten that.
It is important I think to remember the

24

posture of the case, and the posture of this case is

25

that summary judgment was granted to the respondents.

46

1

So that while Kr. Rauh recites as fact that people can't

2 get money from the members of the union, and the staff
3

always supports the incumbents, the evidence in this

4 record is guite the contrary.
5

Indeed, there is

virtually nothing supporting what he is saying, but more

6 importantly,

there is a great deal supporting the other

7 side .

QUESTION:

8

Well, if you are talking about

9 summary judgment, is there really any evidence in the
10 record — I
11

mean, in the sense that you would have after

a case was tried.
SR. GOTTESMAN:

12

Well, there are -- it is not

13 the

same.

And if

But if we are wrong about that and we are

down to fighting about whether the facts are what Mr.
,

5 Rauh says they are, there is not a fact he recited that

6 can be accepted in the present posture of this case.
7 Most of what he said has no record support; all of what
8 he said is flatly contradicted by affidavits that show,
9 as I say, that outsiders have defeated incumbents
10 relying on contributions within the union; that show
11 that Sadlowsky did not make a serious effort to raise
12 money from the union because he did not have to, he had
13 all the money he wanted from outsiders; that show that
¥

14 the staff frequently supports the opponents, sometimes
15 unanimously supports the opponents of incumbents; that
