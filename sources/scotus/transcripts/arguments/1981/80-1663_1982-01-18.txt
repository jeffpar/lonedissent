ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST L. MATHEWS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. MATHEWS;

1 Section 303 suit.

There were other causes of action pleaded

2 which we will allude to, but they are not the subject of the
3 proceeding this afternoon.
4

The union takes the position in this suit that

5 just as Occidental said so strenuously, there is no labor
6 dispute.

We are now echoing it.

There is no labor dispute,

7 because the ingredient of suit on a collective bargaining
8 agreement under a provision to provide labor is not at issue
9 in this lawsuit.

The only dispute here, we say, is that

10 non-labor political, and most important, foreign dispute
11

between the union and the Russians.

12

We feel that the First Circuit was in error when

13 it held that the activities in this case were in commerce so
14 as to be even subject to the provisions of Section 303 of
15 the Act.

We also feel that they were in error when they

16 held that there was a violation of the Act when in this case
17 there just isn’t any primary labor dispute.

And we also

18 would urge this Court that the activity of the longshoremen
19 is protected under

20 down the road.

the First Amendment.

That’s a long way

Actually, the jurisdictional point on

21 whether the case is in commerce disposes of everything, and
22 You 90 beyond there to whether you have a primary labor
23 dispute.

That the Court should get to the First Amendment

24 question is probably doubtful,

but I think it casts, if you

25 will, a shadow forward because so much of what I will say

MR. MATHEWS:

22

Well, yes.

And so why isn't that a labor dispute?

23

It's a dispute over whether or not you can cease furnishing

24

your labor without suffering damages.

25

MR. MATHEWS;

No.

9

Well, but nevertheless, it's a dispute

10 over whether you're going to furnish labor or whether you

Yes, but — well, I don't think we

There may be a secondary labor dispute;

18 that is, whether we have to work or not.

But there is no

19 primary labor dispute, and in the course of my argument I
20 will get to that issue.
21

But much more fundamental is the

threshold issue of whether the activities here are in

22 commerce.

And here the union relies on the decisions of

23 this Court a few years ago, or a whole line of decisions

Over a period of years the Court has ruled that

3 the NLRA was just not intended by Congress to be thrust into
4 affairs that did not concern domestic commerce.

The phrase

5 that the Court has used to denote what was not under the Act
6 is "not in commerce."
7

QUESTION:

But the latter is really a shorthand

8 form of the former.
9

MR. MATHEWS:

Yes.

It's a term of art.

And the Court has said — of course, the

18 ramification if they are not in commerce and not subject to
19 the

Act, then they are not subject to regulation by the

20 NLRB, and they also cannot be made the subject of an action
21 under Section 303 of the

22

Act.

Most of these cases have involved causes of action

23 brought by foreign entities themselves against the union who

And the union said look, what they're arguing here

3 is a secondary boycott subject to Section 8(b)(4) of the
4 Act.

It is under federal jurisdiction and you can't bring a

5 state court action.

And this Court again instructed the

6 union no, that is not true.

We held in the Windward case

7 that your activity directed towards a foreign entity was not
8 in commerce, and we can't say that the same activity, just
9 because it's complained of by a different plaintiff, is now
10 capable of being split off or, and the word the Court uses,
11 the key word, is bifurcated, and made the subject of a

12 domestic dispute.
13

No, leave it to the state courts.

I think this case would not have presented any

14 difficulty to anyone if we had had our companion Windward
15 case.

If the first time that this Russian action of the

16 longshoremen had been triggered was when a Russian ship came
17 into port -- and they were on their way when the thing was

18 called — when this Russian ship came into port if the
19 longshoremen had refused to handle the goods, whatever they

20 might have been, and the Russians had gone into state court,
21 I think anyone would see that the principles in Windward
22 apply even more persuasively than they did in Windward.
23

Not only is this not a dispute aimed at the

24 concerns of the domestic Labor Act -- the wages, conditions,
25 hours of employment, the relations between domestic

trying to affect the conditions aboard an American ship, pay

20 would be in commerce.
21

QUESTION:

Where it's not an American ship —
See, the words "in commerce" define a

22 kind of activity rather than the motive of the people
23

engaged in it, and those cases, it seems to me, could be

24

summarized by saying that the activities of foreign ship

25

owners in delivering goods to the American shores are not in
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON D C 90094 f909* KRA-9A4R

1

2

commerce within the meaning of these statutes.
MR. MATHEWS:

Well, yes — no, I don’t think they

3 could, because the one little exception that proves the
4 rule, that the Court in the Ariadne case where if you looked
5 at what happened, there were the people on the dock and
6 there was the foreign ship, but you really couldn't tell

7 what it was all about, the Court held that was in commerce
8 because what they were disputing over was the foreign ships*
9 wages that they payed American longshoremen on the ground.
10 So it’s really what is the union trying to affect.
11

QUESTION;

In other words, the exclusion from what

12 would normally appear to be commerce is foreign

ship owners

13 insofar as they employ foreign seamen.
14

MR. MATHEWS:

15 that some people make,

Well, that of course is an argument
that the only thing that's not in

16 domestic commerce are foreign ship owners who don't employ
17 or employ foreigners.

I think that's restricting Mobile and

18 Windward to the precise situation raised there, and it's
19 really unrealistic.
20
21

QUESTION;

But the dissents in those cases make a

pretty good argument for not reading them expansively, let

22 me put it that way.
23

MR. MATHEWS;

But for instance, what would you do

24 if the same thing happened at an airport, and we no longer
25 had a foreign ship owner but we had a foreign air fleet, and

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA ME.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the objection was to the way they paid their pilots or
2 something.

I don’t think, there’d be a real distinction

3 there.
4

The real thing is, the controlling factor was what

5 this Court said, that the Congress just didn’t intend to
6 regulate these foreign matters, strain them through the
7 filament of this Act.

And the Court based its holding very

8 strongly on an idea of comity, which I really think I have
9 to address because everyone seems to take this comity to
10 mean they didn't want the National Labor Relations Board
11 getting involved in all this.

And I think that that’s a

12 very oversimplified approach, because there was no question
13 in most of those cases but that the National Labor Relations
14 Board just wasn’t going to get into it.

Nobody could force

15 somebody to bring a charge before the NLRB any more than
16 they could force them to bring a Section 303 action.
17

QUESTION:

Well, would you make the same argument

18 if the strike banners said quit doing business with some

19 shipper that was shipping to Russia?
20

SR. MATHEWS:

21

QUESTION:

Would I make the same argument?

They went to the employer and said quit

22 doing business with Ford shipping to Russia, and they went
23 on strike and said quit doing business with Ford.
24

QUESTION:

And add to that that the objective is

25 to have an influence on the pending labor negotiations which

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 are pending right this minute.

Suppose that was the

2 objective of the union saying don't handle any Ford
3 shipments overseas.
4

MR. MATHEWS:

To have an influence on Ford's

5 pending labor — well, no.

If that were in fact the case,

6 then I don't think you could say it was not in —
7

QUESTION:

8 argument, though.

Well, what about the in commerce
No matter what the purpose of the strike

9 was, what the ultimate objective was, the pressure was
10 placed on the employer by a strike to quit doing business
11

with Ford because Ford was shipping goods to Russia.

12

Now, you wouldn't be making the same commerce

13 argument.
14

MR. MATHEWS:

No,

I don't think -- because you

15 would not have that first confrontation between the union
16 and the foreign power.

I think really there you have a

17 bifurcated -18

QUESTIONS

But what if the result of the action

19 that you took in this case was precisely that:

quit doing

20 business with Ford?
21

MR. MATHEWS:

Well, I don't think that you can do

22 it by the result.
23

QUESTION:

You don't think that’s the purpose?

24

MR. MATHEWS:

25 essential analysis of

Yes.

Well, that’s part of the

any secondary boycott is purpose, and

-

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it seems to run through, as I say in the Ariadne case, it

2 w as what is the purpose of the union.
3

QUESTION;

Are you stuck with the results you

4 predictably produce?
5

MR. MATHEWS;

No, I would not.

If you want to

6 jump to that, Justice White, I think that kind of
7 mechanistic approach is just one reason why this thing
8 should be left to state courts and not given to a
9 bureaucratic agency that tries to put round holes in square
10 pegs.
11

The only thing — and all of the evidence — I

12 mean you do not have before you the analogs -13

QUESTION:

You mean if the state court took this

14 on and then enjoined it you wouldn't be objecting on the
15 ground that the board had exclusive jurisdiction?
16

MR. MATHEWS:

Well, we certainly

wouldn't now, not

17 with what we know about theNLRB, certainly not.
18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. MATHEWS;

No.

And we really

feel that the

20 kind of thing that is involved is really just beyond, I
21 don't want to say competence, but the ken of the board.
22 They look at things from this secondary boycott point of
23 view.

If I can give you an example, we raised First

24 Amendment questions.

They get so far as the finding that

25 the international union did certainly encourage the

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

longshoremen in what they did.

Once you have that, that’s

2 enough to make an inducement for a secondary boycott.

3

But they stop right there and then just don't go

4 into the question of where did this come from, was it really
5 an expression of the will of the individual workers.
6 We’ve satisfied our inducement.

Any predictable,
In fact, they amend

9 Section 8(b)(4) and put ’’effect" instead of "object."

If

10 the union could predict it, it must be an object of the

union to bring to pass.
I, for one, can’t see how a rational person does

12

13 that.

I’ve said to every court if I wished to marry a girl,

14 I get her mother as my mother-in-law.

16 furthest thing from my object in the world.

But in our

17 human life we've got to take the good with the bad.
If the union’s object was nothing more than to

19 themselves refrain from being involved in dealing with the
20 invaders, the predictable results would be

just the same.

OBAL ABGUMENT OF DUANE E. BATISTA, ESQ.
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1

MR. BATISTA;

2
3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Let me first address the issue of jurisdiction and

5 the foreign flagship cases.

One essential thread that comes

6 through all of the foreign flagship cases, starting with
7 Benz through Windward and Mobile, is the question, the
8 concept, the issue of comity.

Again and again this Court in

9 those cases has said it is because of comity and comity
10 considerations alone that we find either the given activity
11
12

in question to be in commerce or not in commerce.
I think initially we need to step back a bit to

13 take a look

at these foreign flagship cases and perhaps put

14 them into perspective.

To my knowledge, and neither the ILA

15 or the AFL-CIO in its amicus has cited anything else, the
16 foreign flagship cases are the only cases anywhere in our
17 jurisprudence that hold that comity considerations preclude
18 a federal statute from applying and

regulating and governing

19 the conduct of Americans on American soil that has a
20 substantial effect on other Americans.
21

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Batista, do you understand

22 that to be, after you’ve gone all through the policy
23 considerations, conclude therefore Congress never intended
24 this Act to reach that conduct?
25

MR. BATISTA;

Well, I think this Court in dealing
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with the particular unique situations presented by the

2 foreign —
3

QUESTION:

Hasn't that ultimately been the — of

4

course, I was in dissent in all those cases — but isn't

5

that ultimately the bottom line, that a statute simply can't

6 be construed to reach conduct of this kind because of the
7

8
9

foreign policy considerations.
MR. BATISTA:

Yes.

Conduct of the kind presented

in the foreign flagship cases.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. BATISTA:

Which I hope to demonstrate is very,

12

very different in terms of comity considerations than the

13

conduct involved in this case.

14

Now, the foreign flagship cases basically by and

15

large, and particularly Windward and Mobile, involved

16

picketing by Americans right at the immediate site of a

17

foreign flagship and its crew.

18

for the purpose of either forcing American law or American

19

standards upon the management and particularly labor

20

relations of that foreign flagship.

21

It was picketing designed

I think one might reasonably view, and certainly

22 one might reasonably not view, but one could reasonably view
23

that kind of conduct as creating a comity problem with

24

respect to relations with the foreign nation under whose

25

flag the ship was flying.
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Rere we have a very, very different, totally

2 different situation.

I think we could perhaps view our

3 situation if we took a mirror image.

Let’s assume that the

4 United States found it necessary to intervene militarily in
5 El Salvador.

Let us assume that as a result of this a

6 Brazilian labor union interfered with trade between Brazil
7 and the United States.

Let us now assume that the

8 Brazilians applied their national labor law, national
9 Brazilian labor law, to regulate or control the action of
10 that labor union.
11

I can't imagine there's anybody in this room that

12 would feel that somehow the Brazilians were interfering with
13 either internal United States law or internal United States
14 policy by applying their Brazilian national law to cover and
15 regulate the conduct of that Brazilian labor union in
16 Brazil.

And that of course, flipping the mirror image back

17 again, is exactly the situation we have in this case.
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Batista, apart from the comity

19 argument, hasn't this Court in the Treefruits case and in

20 the Safeco case indicated that Section 8(b)(4) is directed
21 to an isolated evil, and due to the First Amendment concerns
22 given that a very narrow meaning quite apart from the
23 foreign comity issue?

24

MR. BATISTA:

Well, that really goes to the second

25 issue which is not jurisdiction but whether or not there has

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 bean a violation of the Act

And I think if we turn to that

2 issue, we really, Allied and I think the NLRB, reading their
3 opinion, are strongly relying on Safeco and precisely the
4 distinction made by this Court between Safeco and
5 Treefruits, which is fundamentally that when a union induces
6 employees to, in this case, refuse to handle a product, and
7 it is reasonably foreseeable that substantial business
8 disruption' will result from that inducement, and that
9 inducement can no way be viewed as a primary strike, then by
10 applying the simple, plain language of the National Labor
11 Relations Act, of Section 8(b)(4), you have a secondary
12 boycott.
13

As far as the impact of the constitutional element

14 is concerned, Safeco specifically drew the distinction
15 between on one hand the substantial business disruption; on
16 the other hand contrasting Treefruits, the slight business
17 disruption.
18

Also, I think an excellent point was made by

19 Occidental in

their amicus brief with respect to the

20 constitutional issue, and that was there would be no
21 constitutional issue raised in this case if this were just a
22 run-of-the mill, ordinary hot cargo secondary boycott
23 arising out

of a run-of-the-mill, ordinary labor dispute

24 over wages,

hours,

25 caused

terms, or conditions of employment that

this degree of disruption.
'

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

On the other hand, if this iagrea of disruption

1

2 had been caused arising out of a political objective — for
3

example, protestors blocking exits or entrances to a nuclear

4

power plant — again, there would be no question that those

5

protestors who are disrupting the operation of that nuclear

6 power plant didn’t have First Amendment protection to do
7

this .

8

So in other words, what we're suggesting is what

9

the ILA is trying to do here is add nothing to nothing and

10

get something.

We really submit and we think that the

11

briefs, not only our brief, the brief of the Solicitor

12

General, the briefs of the amici dealing with the

13

constitutional issue show very conclusively that there

14

really is absolutely no substantial constitutional issue

15

here.
The scale of disruption on one hand when balanced

16
17

again against whatever residual constitutional interests

18

might be involved, remember, we are not talking here about

19

rights of individual workers to refuse individually or even

20

spontaneously in concert to handle product.

21

about an order issued by the head of a major labor union who

We are talking

22 has the power -- which labor union has the power to shut
23

down trade, East Coast, Gulf Coast, and the Great Lakes

24

ports .

25

And as far as we can see, the only constitutional
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

right involved is that of allegedly a Mr. Gleason to apply

2 his own beliefs and his own feelings; and we feel that that
3 certainly is not balanced out vis-a-vis
4 disruption involved
5

the extraordinary

in this case.

QUESTION;

Mr. Batista, may I go back, to the

6 jurisdictional issue for a moment?
7 theme that runs through

You emphasize the comity

those cases, and the point being, as

8 I understand it, that the American activity that's not
9 protected would interfere with foreign interests in

running

10 its own affairs with respect to labor relations.
11

But isn't there the same comity interest here in

12 that the activity of the international labor association or
13 —

I'm sorry — the Longshoremen's Association, ILA, clearly

14 must cause friction with Russia if they're not going to ship
15 goods to Russia because of this
16

activity.

Why isn’t the comity — I don't understand why the

17 comity argument you make doesn't cut against you.
18

MR. BATISTA;

Well, for one thing, the activity,

19 governmental regulation of that activity can only create a
20 comity problem if that government regulation tends to
21 protect the activity.

In this situation, as we've tried to

22 develop in our brief and also some of the amici, the
23 activity in question can't be protected because unlike the
24 primary picketing at the primary situs of a foreign
25 flagship, which could be arguably protected activity
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 depending on the nature of the picketing/ statements perhaps
2 some of the pickets have made, and what not -- here, the
3 conduct occurring in the United States, the order of Hr.
4 Gleason, which is the conduct in question, is clearly
5 secondary.
6

And secondly, as also demonstrator argued by Mr.

7 Gies in the JBT case, it can't be protected in any event by
8 Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act because it's
9 devoted towards a political objective by virtue of this
10 Court's — at least language in this Court’s Eastex decision.
11

So for that reason we cannot see —

12

QUESTION;

Your point is that it's friction caused

13 by governmental activity as opposed to the private activity.
14

MR. BATISTA;

15 the private activity.

Well, the friction can be caused by
The question of comity comes into

16 play where the governmental activity tends to protect
17 something that causes the friction.
18

Here we're going in the other direction.

19 here we're going in

I think

the direction really of the question

20 that was raised in the Plumbers Union v. Dorr County case
21 before this Court in the late 1950s where the issue was
22 whether secondary boycott applications law could apply to a
23 dispute with the county or municipality.
24 was

And the question

raised does this interfere with the municipality, and

25 this Court's answer was no,

if anything, applying the

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

secondary boycott provisions to terminate the disruption

2 furthered the interest of the municipality.

So for these reasons we really feel that the

3
4

foreign flagship cases are totally distinguishable and apart

5

from this situation.

6

One final element which is also quite

7

distinguishable and should be kept in mind, the essential

8 inherent dispute or difference in this case revolves around
9

the cargo.

Now, while Mr. Gleason's order also involves

10

Russian ships, Russian ships are not involved in any way,

11

shape or form in this particular case.
He used the example, hypothetical in our brief.

12

13

This case conceptually could have arisen just as easily in

14

the middle of Nebraska where on a trucking dock in Omaha a

15

teamster local union ordered its members not to handle

16

Russian cargo.

17

possible relevance foreign flagship cases could have to this

18

essential product and cargo dispute.

19

dispute and the product dispute that is before this Court

And it just simply escapes Allied what

So it's only the cargo

20 today.
21

QUESTIONS

Your basic comity argument, though,

22 would be equally strong even if there were Russian flagships.
23

MR. BATISTA:

Yes, in our view.

24

I think unless the Court has any further questions

25

— well, let me just cover one point further relating to the
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 secondary boycott issue, and that is that one particular
2 statement that my brother Kr. Mathews made I feel is
3 particularly cogent relating to the situation faced by
4 Allied in terms of the Russian boycott, and that was that a
5 safety factor, he said, in restricting political strikes and
6 disruption of this nature is the union members* need to and
7 interest in being able to eat.
8

The critical element as far as Allied is concerned

9 is we don't have that safety factor here.

Russian trade is

10 but a relatively small percentage of the trade that passes
11

through every or most of the ports in this country.

As long

12 as those ports are reasonably busy, the union can order its
13 members not to handle Russian cargo, and those members will
14 lose little or nothing in terms of wages.
15

Also, the shipping association employers, as a

16 result of this, as long as the ports are reasonably busy,
17 losing little or nothing in profits.

So they have no

18 interest in terminating the dispute, the union members have
19 little or no interest.

It is only Allied and the interests

20 of American foreign policy and others involved in Russian
21 trade that are adversely affected.
22

That's precisely why we feel it is absolutely

23 necessary to

have protection under the National Labor

24 Relations Act to ensure that parties such as Allied can have
25 protection,

and the public can have protection, and the
28

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

15

AS AMICUS CURIAE

16

MR. WALLACE:

17
18 the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Court:
I would like to touch briefly on each of the three

19

20 issues in the case:
21

Nr. Wallace.

the in commerce issue, whether there’s

a violation of 8(b)(4), and the First Amendment issue.

22

The in commerce issue, it seems to us, would be

23 clarified if one would pose the question whether a primary
24 labor dispute with
25 covered,

these particular employers would be

a dispute between the union and what the Court of
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Appeals called the all-American cast of characters here.

It

2 seems that the answer is obvious, and the fact that the
3 dispute here is secondary in nature doesn't give a reason
4 for reaching a different result.

It's only in cases where

5 that dispute and its manifestations coincided with the
6 primary labor dispute that was outside the jurisdiction that
7 the Act that the court has reached a different result.
8 there is no primary labor dispute.

Here

Even though there is a

9 primary dispute of a different nature, there is no concern
10 that somehow the Act or the board's scope because of a
11

primary dispute that coincides with the secondary one will

12 be improperly extended beyond the area where Congress
13 intended it to extend.

And for that reason, there's no

14 reason to reach a different result with respect to a
15 secondary dispute between the union and these employers than
16 would be reached with respect to a primary dispute which
17 would clearly be within

18

the scope of the Act.

Mr. Mathews has posed the hypothetical that a

19 different result or the result would be clearer if this

But what is apparent is that the

he draws to this Court's decision in Windward

24 and Mobile does not seem on

the face of it to be the closest

25 analog, because those two cases involved a dispute about the
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

terms of employment of the foreign seamen on the foreign

2 ship wherein so far as a labor dispute is involved here, the
3 question is
4 foreign

whether American longshoremen will service the

ship.
That is the type of question that was involved in

5

6 the Ariadne case rather than in

7 opposite result was reached.

Windward or Mobile where the

And the Court held that

8 picketing with respect to the longshoremen
9 under which
10 protected by

and the terms

they would service a foreign ship was arguably
the Act and therefore could not be enjoined by

11 the state courts.

And that at least on the face of it seems

12 to be the closer analogy to the hypothetical.

With respect to whether this is a secondary

13

14 boycott prohibited

by 8(b)(4), in one sense it is the

15 classic example of

a secondary boycott, a refusal to handle

16 hot
17 it

cargo, regardless of the reason why the union considers
to be hot cargo.

It certainly, as we show in our brief,

18 within the terms of

8(b)(4), and as we indicate, the

19 legislative history

discussed the purpose of 8(b)(4) in very

20 comprehensive terms.

At one point during the debate Senator

21 Taft said after hearing weeks of testimony no one ever

22 succeeded in explaining to us the difference between a good
23 secondary boycott and a
24
25 most of

bad secondary boycott.

Now, it is true that most of the testimony and
the discussion concerned what typically had been
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 experience,

which was an effort to engage in secondary

2 boycotts in support of primary labor activity.

Political

3 strikes were not commonplace and certainly weren't in the
4 forefront of the discussion.

Minority views were expressed

5 in the committee reports and were supported by President
6 Truman in which they tried to limit the prohibition of
7 8(b)(4) so as to preserve the legality of secondary activity
8 that would be in support of legitimate primary labor-related
9 activity that the union would have an economic interest in.
10 But even that effort to preserve secondary activity in that
11 limited context failed, even when it would be in the union’s
12 economic self-interest to engage in the secondary activity,
13 because the prevailing view was that the secondary activity
14 unfairly had adverse effects on other employers and
15 businesses that were not offending.
16
17 strikes

And there is also one indication that political
were not wholly beyond the attention span of

18 Congress in enacting Taft-Hartley, and that was the fact
19 that they included

in Taft-Hartley a now repealed section,

20 Section 9(h), the anti-communist affidavit section, that was
21 discussed in this Court's opinion in American Communications
22 Associations against Downs, which is not cited in the briefs
23 but it’s 339 U.S. 382.

And the reason that Congress put the

24 non-communist affidavit into Taft-Hartley

was because of

25 concern that union officials with an allegiance to a foreign
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 power or to a party directed by a foreign power might use
2 their office to conduct political strikes, and that would be
3 an unwarranted disruption of commerce.
4

So that this concern was not wholly beyond the

5 purview of those who enacted Taft-Hartley and spoke in such
6 comprehensive terms about prohibiting secondary boycotts.
7

Now, to turn briefly to the First Amendment claim

8 here, which arises not in the context of picketing where
9 there is arguably greater protection of free expression, but
10 in the context of a union-directed work stoppage.
11

The hot cargo, the refusal to handle the hot cargo

12 here really amounts to an adoption by the union of a trade
13 embargo with a foreign power, what might be thought to be a
14 quintessentially governmental decision whether to engage in

15 a trade embargo.
16

The First Amendment claim of a right to do this is

17 really quite an extraordinary claim.

This is a matter that

18 not only is a matter of high governmental policy but a

19 matter of concern to all citizens in the country and to all
20 aspects of opinion in the country, to be expressed through
21 the represen tative processes.

22

But the union, because it is strategically located

23 to do so on its own, is claiming a right to short-circuit
24 anyone else’s discussion of the matter or efforts to
25 influence governmental policy and to decide on its own that

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

9

1

a trade embargo with a foreign nation will in fact be

2 effectuated.

This is an extraordinary claim of a First

3 Amendment right which is really antithetical to the purpose
4 of the First Amendment.
5

QUESTION;

So is your basic submission that it’s

6 conduct rather than speech, is that it?
7

MR. WALLACE;

That is the basic submission.

The

8 fact that it is conduct engaged in for the purpose of
9 expressing a political protest does not mean that the First
10 Amendment immunizes it.
11

QUESTION;

That is —

If they just went ahead and worked but

12 carried the same message around on cardboard it would be all
13 right.
14

MR. WALLACE;

15 they wanted to do.

Or wore black armbands or whatever

And the board has suggested that they

16 could, of course, picket the Russian embassy or consular
17 offices.

But in United States against O'Brien in an opinion

18 of this Court by Chief Justice Warren a similar claim was
19 made with respect to the First Amendment right to burn draft
20 cards as a form of political protest and was rejected by the
21 Court.

And this is certainly conduct that has detrimental

22 effects on other persons that might even be analogized more
23 to a First Amendment claim of right to engage in acts of
24 political terrorisms, but one needn't go that far.

There

25 simply is not a basis for a legitimate First Amendment claim

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST L. MATHEWS, JR., ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MATHEWS;

6

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

7 please the Court;
A word about the safety factor, the asymmetrical

8

9 problem that Mr. Batista mentions.

All I can say is that

10 really it's sort of a naive argument to make.
11

The last time

this union was before this Court it was on the question of

12 containerization, the infamous rules on containers, where
13 the union is going crazy over the loss of work due to
14 technology.

To think that the loss of any day's pay is not

15 a real sacrifice for longshoremen to make or for locals who
16 have particularly heavy traffic in Russian cargo is just
17 simply not to be with the

QUESTION;

Don't you think it's relevant to what

we've got before us in these two cases?
HR. MATHEWS;

It's relevant, but it's not quite

16

the same thing that you have before you; because as I said

17

at the start, this is a transdendent thing.

18

Afghanistan and the Folish thing is such a horrible

I do feel outraged at what

3 happened in Poland and what happened in Afghanistan, and the

5

QUESTION;

I'm talking about the pocketbook issue,

6 which is normally what unions are interested in.
7

MS. MATHEWS:

Yes.

But that's why I say this

8 isn't a pocketbook issue.

It's not a labor dispute.

It's

9 not a commercial dispute.

It's a political dispute.

It’s a

Yes.

I think it has to be

MR. MATHEWS;

Sure.

That’s a personal — what

7 outrageous means.
8

QUESTION;

Don’t you put yourself above the

9 government?
10

MR. MATHEWS;

Not above the government.

What

11 we’re saying is you don’t use a labor act to squelch

12 activity that doesn't have anything to do with labor.
13 That's the problem here.

You're trying to take the National

14 Labor Relations Act, which as Justice O'Connor said had
15 certain specific evils to regulate, and those evils weren’t

the

8 association that was doing the picketing was engaged in a
9 secondary boycott.

10

HR. MATHEWS;

I do.

And I think that, you know,

11 we shouldn’t have the protection of the Act in that
12 situation.

In that situation you have no Norris-LaGuardia.

13 Send it to state court.
14

You know, in doing the research of this case I was

15 amazed at the number of times that the federal district

take a case which somebody tries to bring as a

QUESTION

Do you know of an instance where a

MR. MATHEWS:

No,

I don’t, Your Honor.
