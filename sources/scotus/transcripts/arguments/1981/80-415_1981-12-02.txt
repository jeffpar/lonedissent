ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN O’B. CLARKE, JR., ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6

MR. CLARKE;

7

8 the Court,
9

We will hear arguments next

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

about 18 months ago Congress enacted the Rock

Island Transition and Employee Assistance Act, and as it

10

considered to be an integral part of that Act it added what

11

it considered to be essential to the continuation of rail

12

service in the midwest, and that is, it added an alternative

13

employee protective program that it said should be made

14

available immediately to the employees of the Rock Island

15

who were displaced as a result of the demise of that

16 carryover.
That program was enjoined approximately nine days,

17
18

ten days after it was enacted, signed into law by President

19 Carter.

20 summer of

Congress readdressed the situation during the
1980, and in the Staggers Rail Act enacted an

21 amendment to the Rock Island Act which
22 into law on October

14th, 1980.

On October 16th, an order dated October 15th but

23
24 actually
25

was passed and signed

entered on the 16th, the Court again enjoined, the

district court again enjoined the Act, because it said the

4

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Staggers Rail Act was really only a cosmetic change in the
2 law.

It didn't change the substance of the Act.
At that point, the Railway Labor Executives'

3

4 Association, the appellant in these consolidated cases,

had

5 earlier taken an appeal to this court from the June 9th
6 injunctive order.

That appeal is 80-415.

7 entered the injunctive order on

Once the court

October 16th, RLEA took an

8 appeal to the Seventh Circuit, because in amending the
9 Staggers Act Congress had also amended where the appeal
10

should go.
So we went to the Seventh Circuit, and the Sevent h

11
12

Circuit was required by the Staggers Rail Act amendments to

13 decide the case en banc within 60 days.

It did, but

14 unfortunately it split 3-3, and on December 16th it entered
15 an order affirming the district court's decision.

16

The next appeal was then taken by RLEA to this

17 Court, and on April 27th this Court accepted — or noted
18 probable jurisdiction in the second appeal,

the 1239 case,

19 and deferrad probable jurisdiction in the -- or deferred
20 consideration of probable jurisdiction in the first case.
21

22 point.

At the outset, I would like to clear up one
RLEA submits that the first case, 8415, the appeal

23 was properly filed and timely filed in this Court.

However

24 the Staggers Rail Act Amendments mooted that case, because
25 the Act, the injunctive order which is preventing the

#

1 implementation of the Rock Island Act on employee protection
2is actually the October injunction and not the June
3injunction.

The June injunction is now moot, and we submit

4 probable jurisdiction should be noted and the case vacated
5on grounds of mootness.
6

Going to the questions that are before this Court,

7the first thing that the Court, we submit, has to address is
8the question raised in the -- noting the probable
9 jurisdiction.

That is basically, what issues are before the

lOCourt at this time?

We would submit that when we filed our

11 brief, the only issue that was really before this Court was
12the question of whether or not the Staggers Rail Act
13amendments and the Rock Island Act had granted the estate a
I4remedy or means to obtain compensation.

If compensation was

15available, there cannot be, we submit, an unconstitutional
16taking of property, because the whole substance of the --

17what can be called the just compensation clause or the
18taking clause of the Fifth Amendment is the adequate

l9provision of compensation.
20

QUESTION;

21

MR. CLARKE;

22

QUESTION;

Mr. Clarke -Yes, Your Honor.
-- do you think that Congress acting

23under its commerce power can impair the obligation of
24contracts which the state is specifically prohibited from
25doing by the Constitution?

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. CLARKEt

No, Your Honor.

We do not believe

2 that Congress has that power under the commerce clause to
3impair the obligation of contracts, but the problem in this
4case is, first of all, is that issue really before this
5 Court?

That is basically in the taking issue.

The second

6point is, are the obligations of contract being impaired,
7 and that gets into the question of whether there was a
8 pre-existing obligation on the part of the estate, which we
9 submit there was, and I will get into that in a second or
10 two.
11

The trustee, the creditors and the trustee below

12and the court below, the district court, found that the Rock
13 Island Act affected an unconstitutional taking of property
14because the court indicated it came as a startling concept
15to him, to the court, that Congress could impose an
16obligation upon the estate and take $75 million to be paid
17 to employees.
18

As he went on to say, "Congress does not have the

igpower to take private property for public use."

We submit

20that that is looking at the wrong part of the just
21 compensation or taking clause.

What has to be looked at, as

22 this Court indicated before, is, at the time of the taking,
23was there an adequate provision made for compensation?
24there was in fact an adequate provision, even though the
25money is not paid up front, then there cannot be an

Yes, Your Honor.
Does everyone agree in this case that

10 assuming there was a taking in

the sense that you are taking

11

money out of the state, that it was a taking for public use

12

rather than a transfer of property from one group of private

13 people to another group of private people?

MR. CLARKE;

Your Honor, I do not believe that

15 everyone agrees to that.

1a taking from the railroad to the employees, who are private
2parties, is it necessarily a Tucker Act remedy?
3

MR. CLARKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

We submit if it is

4a taking as a direction of Congress, by an Act of Congress —
5

QUESTION:Even if not for public use?

6

MR. CLARKE:

— even if not for public use.

If

7 Congress believes it was necessary, it would not be a taking
8clause violation.

You might have a due process clause

9violation, but as far as the taking clause is concerned, we
lOwould submit it is not a violation.
11

QUESTION:

What is your authority for the

12 proposition that even if it is not for a public use, there
13 nevertheless is a Tucker Act remedy?
14

MR. CLARKE:

Your Honor, basically, if you take a

15 look at the Rail Act cases, where the Court -16

That's correct. Your Honor, but then

igin the part of the decision that had Footnote 16 to it, the
20court talked about the power of the Tucker Act, and the

21 Tucker Act being a remedy available for a taking that is
22authorized by the government.
23is by the Act of Congress.

Authorized by the government

Here Congress has specifically

24authorized the taking because at the time of the Act it

No, Your Honor.

If there is a

this is discounting, of course, a proper statute, a

regulatory type statute such as in the Turner and Usery

12

case, but if we have a — the only justification for the Act

taking of property.

20 the Tucker

Namely,

Act is there, and that solves the compensation

21 issue.
22

The question of whether there is a taking or not

24 presented in a factual situation where it is a clearcut,
25 concrete situation,

and that situation is not adequate and

QUESTION*

What is your submission as to where

3 that should be determined?
4

NR. CLARKE*

Basically under the Tucker Act

5 provisions in the court of the claim
6

QUESTION*

7

HR. CLARKE*

8 one thing.

Before the court of claims?
Yes, Your Honor, and I might clarify

In our initial brief we indicated that the

9taking issue can arise where either the creditors and the
10 trustees sue the government in the court of claims for the
11 recovery of moneys that were paid out pursuant to the Act.
l2We submit that a more likely scenario, however, would be
13that the creditors, the estate would actually borrow the
14money from the federal government, because Congress had
15provided that money there, and then the question of the
16legality of the priority that 101.10(a) granted to that debt
l7would then be resolved either in the reorganization court or
18the court of claims.
19

QUESTION*

Mr. Clarke, it may be that if the

20United States takes property for public use, that the taking

21 is not subject to an injunction because there is a —
22compensation has been promised, but how about the situation
23where there is a taking — say the United States says, we
24are taking your property, but we are going to take it for
25private use, and you can't complain now because you can go

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to the court of claims and get paid for it.

We are going to

2 take your money, and you can get it back by going to the
3court of claims, but the plaintiff then says, well, that
4 rule may be just find when the taking is for public use, but
5this is for private use, and we should be able to enjoin you.
6

MR. CLARKE;

7

QUESTION;

Your Honor, we would submit -Do you have some authority on that

8 point ?
9
10

MR. CLARKE;
QUESTION;

No, I do not.
I don't think you do, if you don't have

11 it on the point that Justice Stevens asked you about.
12

MR. CLARKE;

The only authority that might come

l3close to that point is -14

QUESTION;

That is what -- The issue here is,

15should the district court have enjoined?
16

MR. CLARKE;

That is correct, Your Honor, and we

17submit it should not have enjoined because the Tucker Act
18was available, and the -- this is not -- the Wilson versus

igNew case is sort of on this one point, because in order to
20determine that Congress is taking property for private as

21 compared to public use, you have to look behind the
22enactment of — Congress’s enactment, and you have to look
23at the reasons that Congress did what it did.

24

Granted, this Court has the right to see if there

25 is a rational connection, but if Congress states in the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 preamble of its Act that it is exercising its powers under
2the commerce clause to enact legislation which it believes
3has a public purpose, and that the Act it is doing is simply
4 compromising an obligation that already existed, and this is
5 why we submit that the taking issue when it finally does
6come up is not really -7

QUESTION*

Well, if the district court thought,

8though, that it was entitled to give an injunction if there
9was a taking for private use, it seems to me the taking
10issue is fairly posed here.

If you happen to agree with --

11 if you happen to agree that an injunction would be
12authorized in the event of a taking for a private use, then
I3the taking issue is posed.
14

MR. CLARKE*

Your Honor, it goes back to the

15guestion — it is not so much the taking issue, because the
16taking issue in this case is really, when does a regulation
17 become a taking?
I8issue.

That is the ultimate part of the taking

One aspect of the taking issue here would be the

igguestion of whether or not the Act that Congress did was
20public or private benefit.
21

Now, one thing that has been sort of missed or not

22highlighted in this case is the actual factual situation
23which leads to the conclusion that this was in fact an Act
24of Congress under its commerce clause for a public benefit,
25a very strong public interest.

When the Rock Island Act was

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 being considered by Congress, it started back in February
2and March of 1980, before the abandonment order was even
3authorized to be sought for.

That didn't occur until April

414th, and when Congress was considering what to do with the
5demise of the Rock Island and the directed service which was
6 to end on May 31st, at that point there was no more
7authority in the ICC to authorize any continued operation
8over that line, and the line would completely cease and all
9service would end at that point.
10

So, Congress had to address that issue, and in

11 addressing that issue. Congress realized, as this Court has
vindicated from back in the 1930s, the interest of employees
I3was an extremely important element in the perpetuation of
I4that service, and in order to afford that employee
15protection, if you want to call it that, arrangements to
16help the people who are being affected, and to preserve the

I7public interest, Congress had to look at the interest of
isemployees, which this Court has again said is part of the
ignational interest.
20

And in doing that. Congress worked, and as the

21 legislative history indicates, Congress worked along with
22labor and representatives of rail management, and the
23arrangement that came out of that combination of the parties
24was a combination of the Miami Accords for the March 4
25hiring agreement and this particular piece of legislation.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The basic illogic that the court found in this

2 legislation only comes because he is disregarding the March
34 agreement.

The March 4 agreement is an integral part of

4the Rock Island legislation, and between the two, they
5provide a form of protection for employees who have spent
6their time in operating this railroad, who would then be
7available for continued rail operations over that line.
8

It takes experienced people to operate a railroad ,

9operate it safely and efficiently.
10

QUESTION*

Mr. Clarke, isn't it correct the March

114 agreement related to employees who were going to continue
12 to work?
13

MR. CLARKE*

14

QUESTION*

That is correct, Your Honor.
Whereas this protection is for people

15who are terminated.
16

MR. CLARKE;

17 protect ion.

That is the second half of the

The protection to be adequate for an employee

18of a railroad has to cover the situation of an employee who
I9is hired and an employee who is not hired.

The March 4

20 agreement was to encourage carriers to hire people.
21

QUESTION*

Right.

22

MR. CLARKE*

And then when they are hired to give

23 them some form of protection.

24

QUESTION*

But is it not true that the benefits of

25this statute, if it is held valid, will all go to terminated

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employees, not to the same people who benefit from the March
2 4 agreement?
3

MR. CLARKE;

Terminated employees, but who are

4still available for continued rail service in that area.
5

QUESTION;

Well, yes, but —

6

MR. CLARKE;

7

QUESTION;

And there is another advantage --- but the purpose of it is to protect

8them in the event they don't get further jobs.
9

MR. CLARKE;

Yes, but that purpose, that is the

10immediate, I mean, that is the way Congress -- the end that
11 Congress used to accomplish its purpose, but its purpose
I2that Congress said it was doing was to provide a protection
l3for employees to enable to continued operation of lines.
14

QUESTION;

But it just doesn't fit the facts.

15

MR. CLARKE;

But we submit it does, Your Honor,

16when you look at the agreement, the March 4 hiring
I7agreement, together with the Rock Island protection, just
18like the Milwaukee situation.

The Milwaukee Section 9

19agreement combined with the March 4 agreement gave the

20Protection for the interim operations -21

QUESTION;

22Working.

I understand that, but --

23

MR. CLARKE;

24Your Honor.

Those are all for people who are still

But not on the Milwaukee agreement,

The Milwaukee agreement had protection for

25People who were not working, and then the March 4 agreement

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 protected those who were carried over, but there is a very
2strong public benefit that comes out of this type of
3enactment, and that is the fact that railroad workers do not
4have the type of pension systems that other people have, and
5 their whole collective bargaining agreements have protective
6 arrangements built into it.

Those protective arrangements

7have provided a sort of guaranteed security for employees,
8that in the event of any cessation of operations, that they
9are not just going to be forgotten.
10

QUESTION:

Is the Railroad Retirement Act gone?

11

HR. CLARKE:

It is not gone, Your Honor, but the

12benefits to these people —
13

QUESTION:

Well,

I thought you said they had no

l4protection at all.
15

MR. CLARKE:

16

QUESTION:

The only protection they have -But that is a protection, though, isn’t

17 it?
18

MR. CLARKE:

$25 a day for five days a week,

igand those benefits are almost exhausted
20

QUESTION:

But it is something.

21

MR. CLARKE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CLARKE:

24

QUESTION:

That is $125 a day -- $125 a week
It is something.
That is correct, Your Honor
That is all I was trying to get you to

25 say .

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. CLARKE;

There is protection of that sort, but

2the guaranteed job security that these people have enjoyed
3over the years guaranteed them more than that type of
4protection.

It guaranteed them a different form of

5protection.

It guaranteed them sort of a preservation of

6their jobs.

And what we are facing here is a situation

7where Congress, when it enacted this legislation, believed
8that its earlier enactments had required that that be
9imposed in this case, and in order to make sure that that
10protection, which it submitted was in the public interest,
11 be imposed, it enacted Section 106 of the Act.
12

I realize my time is very near the end.

I would

13ask to reserve whatever time I have left for rebuttal.
14

QUESTION;

May I ask you a question without

I5intruding on your time?
16

MR. CLARKE;

Yes, sir.

I appreciate that.

17

QUESTION;

I8«lustice.

Your position in part is that this did not create

19a new obligation, but merely compromised a pre-existing

MR. CLARKE;

QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.
Could you tell me what in your view the

23 magnitude of the pre-existing obligation was, and was it
24larger or smaller than the new obligation?

25

MR. CLARKE;

Your Honor, it is hard to place an

18

1 actual figure on it, but the levels of protection which we
2submit 11-347 require, the Interstate Commerce Act, which is
3made mandatory here by 17(a)(1) of the -- 17(a) of the
4 Milwaukee Act, is that there be guaranteed income for six
5 years with all cost of living adjustments added into it, in
6other words, 100 percent of your income for six years from
7 the date of your effect, or an option on the employee to
Stake a separation allowance which equals three -- and for
9 people with over ten years — five years of service, 360
lOtimes your last daily rate of pay.
11

QUESTION;

And is it your position that the

12employees would have been entitled to that if this statute
13had never been enacted?
14

ME. CLARKE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

15Unfortuntely, the Seventh Circuit has taken a different
16position, but the important thing on this is, the ICC up
17until 1976 always considered itself to have the discretion
181o impose this level -- this type of protection in an entire

igline abandonment case, that in 1979, when Congress -- 1976,
20we submit Congress took that discretion away.

In 1979, it

21 transferred the remaining discretion and the power the ICC
22had to authorize abandonments over to the reorganization
23court, and the legislative history in the Rock Island Act,

24Prior to the whole confirmation of the abandonment coming up
25in the reorganization court indicates that Congress believed

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1that the '79 Act and the '76 Act, based on the '76 Act, had
2required that level of protection in this case.
3

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELINOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLEES SUPPORTING APPELLANT

7

MRS. STILLMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8please the Court, federal appellees appear here today in
9support of RLEA's appeal from the October order -- from the
lOSeventh Circuit’s affirmance of the district court's October
11 order holding an Act of Congress -- enjoining an Act of
l2Congress on grounds of its unconstitutionality.

We regard

13 the earlier case as moot.
14

The federal appellees submit that the amended Rock

15lsland Act does not, as the district court concluded, affect
16an unconstitutional taking of private property.

I7basic arguments on this point.

We make two

First, we submit that the

18 Act does not take property within the meaning of the Fifth
l9Amendment, and second, if, contrary to our submission, the
20Court were to find that it did effect a taking of property,
21 we submit that a reasonable, proper, and adequate provision
22for compensation has been made in the Tucker Act, and
23therefore, for two reasons it was improper for the district
24court to enter this injunction.

Either there was an

25adequate remedy at law, or there was no violation to remedy.

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I am going to address the taking question first, a

1

2 question that we do urge the Court to decide in this case.
3 And to understand what — why we
4 Act is not

are trying to say that this

a taking, you have to step back for a moment and

5 consider the crisis that Congress was responding to when it
6 was considering and when it enacted the Rock Island Act, and
7 you have to consider also the legal and historical context
8 with respect to employee protection against which Congress
9was also — to which Congress was also responding.
10

The Rock Island Act did not, as the private

11 appellees occasionally suggest, leap unannounced out of
l2Congress's

brow three days before the district court

l3authorized

the abandonment here.

In September of 1979, the

14Rock Island Act totally ceased operations over all of its
15 lines.

It was of critical importance to the middle west,

16 particulariy to the shipment of farm products out there, and
I7in months thereafter this transportation system was held
18 together just essentially by direct service orders given by
19 the ICC.
20

Congress was justifiably concerned with the effect

21 of the liquidiation of so large a railroad, not only on the
22 middle west but on transportation services generally, on its
23 ripple effect with respect to other lines, and the Rock
24 I si and Act,

which was a Congressional response to this, the

25 Senate report on this issued in March of 1980, this Act

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 called for, among other things, the implementation of a plan
2 either negotiated by the parties or devised by the ICC for
3providing limited compensation for those employees who were
4displaced as a result of the Rock Island's termination of
5 operations.
6

It further provided that the cost of the plan

7would be charged to administrative expenses of the estate,
8that the benefits could be paid through federally guaranteed
9loans, and that there would be a top, a maximum of $75
lOmillion.

It could not exceed that amount.

11

QUESTION;

But Congress didn’t attempt to

I2intervene in the proceeding to say that the Rock Island
13should continue to operate.
14

MRS. STILLMAN;

No, it gave certain directed

I5service authority to the ICC.
16

QUESTION;

It just accepted what the reality was.

17

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, it was trying -- what

isCongress was really trying to do here was create a situation
igwhich would encourage buyers for these lines.

They want

20these lines to stay in business with other buyers.

They

21 have put money in the Act for non-railroad carriers to buy
22some of these lines.

They want the existing service to stay

23there to the extent possible, and the states want this, too,
24and they viewed this labor protection, as counsel for RLEA
25has tried to suggest, as integral to holding the system

22

1 together, and I think what he was trying to suggest to you
2here when he was talking about the March 4th agreement is
3 that a large incentive for the union to enter into that
4 agreement was that they assumed that Congress was proceeding
5along the lines to enact this other legislation which would
6take care of these other employees.
7think, as part of a package.
8incentives.

It regarded it, I

That was one of the

Now, maybe they would have been wiser not to

9sign this agreement on March 4th, 1980, and wait to see if
10the other thing would be upheld, but they didn't.
11

QUESTION*

Well, my question really is, do you

12 think Congress intended to amend or repeal any part of the
13 reorganization laws?
14

MRS. STILLMAN*

No.

I think Congress — here what

15 I would like to say —
16

QUESTION*

It didn't attempt to intervene in the

l7proceeding to overturn any -18

MRS. STILLMAN*

No, I don’t believe Congress

19thought it was overturning anything.

As the counsel for

20RLEA has suggested. Congress as they looked at the law

21 affecting employee protection arrangements when they were -22when they were devising this statute, what was on the books
23then affecting this railroad was the Milwaukee Act, Section

2417(a) of the Milwaukee Act, which said, certificates of
25 abandonment shall include conditions providing fair and

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 equitable arrangements for the employees, shall include

It

2was absolute language.
3

Now, it is true that there had been

4interpretations of that language as giving discretion to the
5 reorganization court, similar to what the ICC had considered
6that it had under the Four R Act, discretion not to impose
7employee protection arrangements in some cases of whole line
8abandonments, but just as the ICC had always thought they
9had the discretion to create exceptions to their general
lOrule that they wouldn’t apply these conditions in whole line
11 abandonments, that discretion remained here.
12

There was a very real possibility, while Congress

I3was devising this legislation, that this estate could have
14had imposed on it what are called the New York dock
15 conditions, and that is a very high level of employee
16protection which goes up to six years, and as to the
17guestion of how much liability there might have been here

l8for this railroad, for the estate, if the New York dock
19conditions had been imposed, I think you get some idea of
20that from Footnote 27 on Page 52 of the private appellees’
21 brief, where they discuss what happened under the Milwaukee
22statute.

You know the Rock Island provisions here were

23tnodeled on Section 6 and Section —

24

QUESTION:

Mrs. Stillman?

25

MRS. STILLMAN:

Excuse me.

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION: A moment ago, you used

the term

2 federally guaranteed loans.
3

MRS. STILLMAN:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

Does that mean that

if the original

5obligor defaults and the federal government has to come in
6and make good on its guarantee, the government has recourse
7against the original obligor?
8

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

I think that money is put in

9escrow funds, but yes, I would say the government would have
10 recourse.
11

What I am trying to suggest is that there was a

12 very large potential liability here.
13whether it would be imposed.

Now, it wasn't certain

It was just, it could be

14 imposed.
15

QUESTION:

Well, it has now been decided that

I6there was no such liability, hasn't it?
17

MRS. STILLMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, this is after the fact.

Right.
At the time Congress was

20legislating this, there was --

21

QUESTION:

But you are not suggesting that the

22unions didn't really want this legislation, are you?

23

MRS. STILLMAN:

No, I will say that neither the

24unions nor the estate had any concrete, absolute guarantee
25that that --

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

No, but there was a history of ICC

2 total abandonments where they had not -3

MRS. STILLMAN*

Yes, but the ICC had always said,

4 well, we make exceptions in appropriate cases, and the ICC
5has never -6

QUESTION*

7take the risk.
8

But the union really didn't want to

That is rather clear, I think.

MRS. STILLMAN*

Well, there were risks on both

9sides, and Congress —
10

QUESTION*

Well, the other side doesn't think

11 there was much of a risk.
12

MRS. STILLMAN*

-- Congress addressing these

I3risks, and I might say again in terms of the amount of money
14that they were talking about here, Footnote 27 in the
I5private appellees' brief says that it was calculated for the
16Milwaukee Railroad that if New York dock conditions had been

I7applied there, the liability might have been anything up to
18$1 billion.

They say the best estimate was $350 million.

19The Milwaukee Railroad was roughly comparable in size to the
20Rock Island.

I think it had a few more employees, but not

21 very many more employees.

22

And the ICC in its recommendation report to the

23reorganization court when it recommended approving the
24abandonment, they had a brief section on labor protection.
25They made no recommendation because they said as far as we

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 are concerned this is being taken care of by Congress, so we
2 don't feel that we should make a recommendation.

They did

3 note their policy of not having applied it in whole line
4 abandonments, but they nevertheless told the reorganization
5court a viable option is imposition of New York dock
6conditions.

That was a very large liability, and Congress,

7looking at the state of the law, which would have permitted
8the imposition of that liability, simply said, we think,
9 considering all of the factors here, the necessity to have
lOlabor stability which will encourage other rail buyers to
11 buy these lines, we think we also want to, by the way,
12 encourage employees of other marginal carriers.
13

QUESTION;

Wasn't the March 4th agreement intended

14to enable sale of the lines by reducing the obligation of
15the employees?
16

MBS. STILLMAN;

17

QUESTION;

That's true.

That's true.

Mrs. Stillman, supposing that Rock

18lsland had been a going concern.

Do you think Congress

19could have singled it out and said to its management, every
20employee on the Rock Island shall receive hourly wage of $5

21 an hour or more?
22

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, that would be an exercise of

23Congress's commerce power, which always would have to be
24tested for a rational basis as to whether that was a
25rational decision, a reasonable consideration of the class.

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 And I think it would stand or fall on that
2

We think here this was a rational response.

The

3Rock Island was the only large railroad in the middle west
4 that was in these desperate straits.

They were simply

Sapplying a legislative solution that fit the particular
6problem that they were addressing, a serious problem of
7interstate commerce which they had every right under the
8commerce power to address.
9

I would like also to address the question of

lOwhether this was just giving private property from one group
11 of people to another group of people.

12

QUESTION:

On that subject —

13

MRS. STILLMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- let me just pose a question, because

151 am glad to are getting to that.

In your brief, although I

16notice, and perhaps other wrote the brief, on Page 19 you
I7have the sentence,

"When a government regulation adjusting

I8the burdens and benefits of economic life between private
19parites is held to be a taking,

the government ordinarily

20should be given an opportunity to make a choice whether to
21 rescind the regulation or pay just compensation."

Do you

22contend this case comes within that sentence?

23

MRS. STILLMAN:

I think there are two ideas that

24are included there in the sentence.

I think there is one

25idea that was suggested --

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

Is this an adjustment between private

2 parties?
3

MRS. STILLMAN;

An adjustment between private

4 parties which is critical to the public interest, and to
5 address that point, what I would like to call the Court's
6attention to is the case of Dayton Goose Creek Railway
7 against United States, a very early case which involved -8

QUESTION;

Well, I would first like to know

9 whether you think that sentence applies to this case.
10

MRS. STILLMAN;

Yes, I think it does.

But then I

11 would like to explain why I think that is -12

QUESTION;

And you think Congress should be given

13a chance to decide whether or not, if it is a taking, they
14 want to pay for it?
15

MRS. STILLMAN;

16

QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

And that they have not yet made an

17 unequivocal determination -18

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, let me say this.

If

igCongress failed to act now and that money is paid out, and
20this Court considers it a taking, they will be bound.

I

21 mean, there is nothing they can do once the money is paid
22 out.
23

QUESTION;

It isn't paid out yet.

24

MRS. STILLMAN;

25

QUESTION;

It isn't paid out yet.

And if we said there was a taking, you

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 think

you would like to know whether it is a taking or

2not so Congress could know whether to repeal?
3

MRS. STILLMAN;

That’s correct.

That's correct,

4 yes .
5

QUESTION;

They have to act within 15 days, as I

6understand it, of our judgment.
7

MRS. STILLMAN;

8

QUESTION;

9would they not?

Excuse me?

They would have to act within

15 days,

Because if the injunctio is set aside,

lOthere is a duty to decide the matter within 15 days.
11

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, that’s right, but then what

I2happens is, the ICC then has to devise a plan, and then it
I3is approved by — then the —
14

QUESTION;

It is a rather accelerated time

15 schedule.
16

MRS. STILLMAN;

Yes, that's true.

That's true.

l7There is some dispute, I think, between the private
18appellees and the RLEA as to how long it would take before
igyou could get actual payments of money.
20

But what I would like to say,

going to this

21 question of the private parties, in the Dayton Goose Creek
22Bailway case, what happened there was, the ICC had a
23regulation according to which they said, if railroads are
24earning profits over a certain amount, above a certain rate
25of return, we consider those excess profits, and we are

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 going to require that they put half of those excess profits
2 into this general fund, and this general fund will provide
3eguipment and loans for other weaker carriers, and we see
4 this as essential to the national transportation system.
5

This Court upheld that.

Now, that was taking

6property from one party and giving it to another party, and
7 the Court found that a proper use of ICC power.
8

Now, what we say here is that the money that was

9 in the estate, the $75 million, if you want to segregate it
lOout, at all times existed under the potential liability,
11 under the Milwaukee Act, under Section 17(a), of being
12awarded to the union under an employee protection
13arrangement.

That was the state of the law.

That potential

I4claim existed there.
15

All that Congress did was fix that claim at a

16lower amount and make it certain that there would be $75
17million.

So really all it did was amend the law to take

18vhat was potential, make it actual, and to fix it at a lower
19level.

We don't see this as a taking of property.

We don’t

20 see this as an irrational exercise of the commerce power,

21 nor do we see it as an intervention into the reorganization
22court's jurisdiction.

23

QUESTION;

Well, do you see this case as one

24within the Tucker Act, if we. A, said there was a taking, or
25B, we said there was not a taking?

and it later is

11 determined to be a taking, and if the estate has paid out
12 $75 million, the estate would have a claim in the court of
13claims -14

QUESTION*

But Mrs. Stillman, what if we say it is

15a taking for private use?
16

MRS. STILLMAN:

Then what happens?
This is a somewhat more difficult

17question, because, of course, under United States against

18Testin, this Court has said that there is no liability
igagainst the United States in the court of claims except
20where there is a right for damages, and of course the just
21 compensation clause provides such a right.

22

We certainly would have to agree that

if there

23were a separation of powers violation or anything like that,
24there probably would not be a money remedy in the court of

25Claims.

1

QUESTION!

In which event the question of an

2injunction comes up.
3

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes, in which event -- but we very

4 strongly argue here that there is no serious question that
5there is not in rational terms some benefit to the public
6 interest.
7

QUESTION*

Do you think the United States would be

8foreclosed from arguing in the court of claims that it was a
9taking for private use and therefore the remedy is not
10 available?

I know the appellees here, of course, argue that

11 the remedy is available because they don’t want to get -I2they want to get the money somewhere, presumably.

But would

13not the United States have the right to argue, oh, no, this
14was not a taking for public use, this was -- there was
15evidence of Congressional intent to make it administrative
16expense and not incur an absolute liability?
17

MRS. STILLMAN*

Your Honor, Congress made a

I8finding in this legislation that it was in the public
19interest.
20

Now -QUESTION*

That is not the same as a taking for

That

Would that be a taking for public

They said interstate commerce will benefit because

4they are more efficient, and all that sort of thing.
5

MRS. STILLMAN:

I guess one reason this is

6difficult is because that is a sort of substantive due
7process test, and as you suggest —
8

QUESTION*

Well, yes, and I think it is difficult

9because there is no precedent -10

HRS. STILLMAN*

11

QUESTION*

12

MRS. STILLMAN*

Yes, that's right.

-- that really supports your position.
Well, you have suggested, I think,

13in your opinion in Moore against City of East Cleveland that
14what the Court has done at some times in the past is apply
15what you called a fused test, a substantive due process test
16with a taking test.

It is sometimes hard to tell which test

17the Court is applying, because to some extent when you talk
18about justice and fairness under the takings test, you are

igtalking about some of the same factors that you talk about
20under substantive due process.

21

QUESTION*

But if you are not talking about a real

22taking, but just an unconstitutional interference with

23Property, then you can't avoid the injunction question.
24

MRS. STILLMAN:

25

Well, I don't —

Can you?

1

MBS. STILLMAN:

2 that there is a public

It seems to me it is so clear here

-- that the public use of this money

3 is the benefit to the public.

The fact that it is being

4 given to private parties just doesn't bear on that question.
5

QUESTION:

Your avoidance of the question I take

6 it is an answer.

7

MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, I am reluctant to recklessly

8 open up the Treasury and the court of claims, but on the

9 other hand I don't want to suggest that this injunction
10 should

stand, because we think clearly there is no basis for

standing.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

13

MRS. STILLMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

In deciding its position in this case,

15 did the government give any consideration whatever to the
16 position of the investors in this railroad concededly
17 bankrupt and unable to operate further with assets of $204
18 million, and the government imposing an administrative claim
19 of $75 million ahead of those investors?
20

MRS. STILLMAN:

21

QUESTION:

22 in another railroad

Yes.

Do you think anybody would ever invest
if this can happen?

Under your theory,

23 the government could have asserted, approved, or authorized
24 an administrative claim, and brand new one, of $204
25 million.

Why stop at six years' compensation?

Could it

41iability.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. MURRAY, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE NON-FEDERAL APPELLEES

18

MR. MURRAY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I9the Court, the principal issue presented in this appeal is
20whether by special legislation Congress can impose upon a
21 bankrupt railroad already in liquidation a new obligation
22solely for the benefit of its former employees who are no
23longer going to be working in the railroad industry, an
24obligation that will displace the interests of the creditors
25and the shareholders of that railroad.

1

This proceeding pends under Section 77 of the

2Bankruptcy Act, and this Act has two purposes, first, the
3public interest in continued rail service, and secondly, and
4 an equally important purpose, the conservation of the estate
5in the interest of the creditors and the shareholders.

Now,

6at the outset of these proceedings, when they were filed on
7Karch 17, 1975, Judge McGarr ordered the trustee to continue
8operations of the Rock Island, and at that time he had to
9mak a determination that the railroad was reorganizable, and
lOthat the security of the creditors would not be impaired,
Hand I would submit to the Court that if Judge McGarr had
12thought at that time that there was a possibility of labor
13 protection being imposed in the amounts that the RLEA and
14the government contend was possible, he never would have
15permitted reorganization to go on at that time.

He would

16have stopped it right then and there, because the thought of
izimposing six years of wages, giving that to employees in the
18event of liquidation, would mean that there would be no way
19that the security of the creditors could be protected if

20reorganization proceedings would be ongoing, and I submit
21 that that would be true in almost every railroad

22 reorganization proceeding, that the proceeding would have to
23stop right there if a liability of that magnitude could be
24imposed upon the estate of a railroad.

25

Now, in pursuit of these public interest

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 objectives of Section 77, however, the reorganization court
2 permitted the ongoing rail operations, and for five years,
3the trustee of the Rock Island paid out $1 billion in wages
4and benefits to the Rock Island employees while the estate
5eroded in an amount in excess of $210 million, and in answer
6to Justice Marshal's question about the continuation of the
7 Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and the Railroad
8Retirement Fund, I should point out that during this time of
9 reorganization, the Rock Island trustee contributed over $14
10million to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Fund, and in
11 excess of $100 million to the Railroad Retirement Fund, just
I2as the Rock Island had done in years prior to
13 reorganization.

Of course, we have no question about the

l4propriety of those contributions.
15

As the reorganization entered its fifth year,

16three key events occurred, and they have been alluded to
I7thus far in the argument.
18of

The first occurred in the summer

1979, when the employees of the Rock Island struck the

19Rock Island, and as a result it ceased rail operations, and
20on September 26th,

1979, the Interstate Commerce Commission

21 declared the Rock Island trustee cashless,

and from that

22Point forward the trustee himself was not able to conduct
23any rail operations.
24

The second key event was on January 25, 1980, when

25the reorganization court found that there no longer was any

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 possibility of a successful reorganization of the Bock
2Island, and he ordered the trustee to commence liquidation.
3And really, from that point forward, the Rock Island's fate
4 was sealed.

From that point forward, it was clear that the

5Rock Island was withdrawing from the public interest service.
6

Then, on June 2 of 1980, the reorganization court

7 formally confirmed the total abandonment of all of its
81ines, and at that time declined to condition abandonment on
9the payment of any form of the so-called traditional labor
10 protection, and that order was affirmed by the Seventh
11 Circuit court of appeals.
12

It was just on the eve of that particular order

13 that Congress enacted and President Carter signed into law
14the Rock Island Transition and Employee Assistance Act with
I5its new labor protection obligation of $75 million, and that
16Act in essence would impose a payment of 80 percent of a
17former employee's salary for up to three years or a lump sum
18payment to each employee of $25,000, depending upon
19 seniority.
20

Congress stated the purpose of that Act to be a

21 public purpose, to continue rail service in the midwest, but
22as Judge McGarr found, there was no connection between the

23Payment of a lump sum severance pay to a former employee who
24 was no longer going to continue in any rail service, there
25was no connection between that and ongoing rail operations

QUESTION*

This Act didn’t reactivate the

3 operations of the Rock Island?
4

MR. MURRAY*

5 by the trustee.

It did not reactivate the operation

There was some directed service that was

6ongoing, imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and
7that is the subject of separate litigation, but as of
8September when the strike occurred, September of 1979, the
9Rock Island trustee no longer operated any railroad.

That

10 was the point at which the Rock Island stopped all rail
11 operations.
12

He question the public purpose of this Act,

13because in our view it is not being paid to employees who
I4are continuing in rail service.

It is being paid to

15employees who are no longer in the railroad industry, who
16have not been employed by railroads who are continuing
17operations, other railroads.

So there is no relationship.

18This case is quite unlike the Loudon case, for example,

igwhich the RLEA relies upon, where there was an ongoing rail
20service by the Rock Island in one of its earlier
21 reorganizations, and there was a rationale in that case to
22Pay labor severance pay because it was a -- that case
23involved a partial merger or consolidation.
24was ongoing.

The railroad

It was obtaining net income that was generated

25by the savings that were affected by the consolidation of

Our case is one where this railroad has totally

QUESTION:

Well, if the Interstat e Commerce

6

MR. MURRAY:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And then Congress came along and said,

8well, we ace going to exercise your discret ion for you.

Well, I submit that in this case they

25Profits

MR. MURRAY:

Well, that was a case where a

that was ongoing was required to share its excess
with other railroads, and I think it is understood

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that all railroads operate in a kind of community of
2 interest.

They operate their interline payments that are

3generated.

There are all kinds of -- there is a common

4 carrier — there is a common fleet of cars.

It is important

5 to one ongoing railroad that all the other ongoing railroads
6are healthy, but that is not the situation of the Rock
7Island.

The Rock Island is withdrawing from the railroad

8 business.
9

Under the Brooks-Scanlon case, the creditors and

10the shareholders of the Rock Island cannot be compelled to
11 continue their investment in a railroad for an indefinite
12period with continuing losses.
13 some point to that.

There has to come an end at

And that is what Judge McGarr held

14happened on January 25, 1980.
15

So, the Rock Island is withdrawing from that group

16of common carriers that have a common enterprise together,
I7and I think that is the distinction of that Dayton case.
18

The Seventh Circuit's reasoning has been followed

I9by the court in the Third Circuit in the Susguehannah case,
20and by the special court in the valuation proceedings case,
21 in a decision just handed down on November 24,

1981 , in

22which the court stated that we would have considerable doubt
23tegarding the constitutionality of Interstate Commerce
24Commission imposition of labor protection conditions in the
25abandonment of a hopelessly losing railroad.

QUESTIONS

Let me see if I understand your earlier

Suppose a railroad decided that it was going to just

3cut off some of its outlying services and the ICC approved,
4and severance pay was ordered as a condition by the ICC.
5That would certainly be an appropriate corporate purpose,
6would it not?
7

MR. MURRAY:

Absolutely.

That’s correct, Your

8 Hon or.
9

QUESTION:

Is there any relationship between that

10 — Let me put it this way.

I got an impression from you

11 that if the railroad were an ongoing operation, you would
12have a different situation with respect to the hypothetical
131 just presented to you.
14

MR. MURRAY*

We would be in the position, for

15example, of the Milwaukee Road, which is an ongoing rail
16operation, and it is in the process of contracting, and it
17does have a labor protection obligation under the
l8traditional form of labor protection, and the Milwaukee
igRailroad Restructuring Act does benefit it, because it takes
20vhat would be a larger obligation and scales it down, but

21 the Commission has always drawn a distinction between a
22total abandonment and a partial abandonment.
23

In a partial abandonment situation, the railroad

24has an interest in cutting back, scaling back that
250bligation.

There is a savings that is generated that

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 creates a greater net income that the ICC has said should be
2 shared with the employees who have to bear the brunt of that
3 loss.
4
5situation.
6

In a total abandonment situation, it is a loss
There is no net income from ongoing -QUESTION;

What if it is just a total abandonment,

7 just a withdrawal, no liquidation, or no -- it is not in a
8 Section 77 reorganization, and it is not liquidating?
9

MR. MURRAY;

I think that is the exception I posed

10earlier, that there might be a situation where a perfectly
11 healthy railroad, for whatever reason, is withdrawing.
12

QUESTION;

Yes.

13

MR. MURRAY;

I think that is a different case, and

14 perhaps as a matter of statutory law a labor protection
15obligation could be imposed in that case.

Brooks-Scanlon

16and the Brooks-Scanlon precedent would not be operating
17 there.
18

QUESTION;

So the railroad says, we are going to

19withdraw from the railroad business, but we have got a lot
20of money and we are going to go to some other business.
21

MR. HURRAY;

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. MURRAY;

Right.
Do you think
That would

that -be a differentcase,

and

But that is not this case.

I

1

MR. MURRAY;

That is not the Brooks-Scanlon case

2 This is a situation in which this railroad has had massive
31osses over the last five years, and is simply in the
4 process of withdrawing and trying to provide for a
5liquidation, a complete liquidation.
6

QUESTION;

What about an employer who is in a

Zlosing situation when the Fair Labor Standards Act was
Spassed providing for minimum wages?

Do you think that he

9could claim an exemption because he was in a bad financial
10 position ?
11

MR. MURRAY;

No.

As a matter of fact, I would sa

12that under the — I have already indicated in the case of
13the Rock Island the Rock Island was paying, even though it
I4was losing money over the course of the reorganization and
15was making contributions to the Railroad Retirement Fund an
16to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Fund, and I would
17suggest that that is an instance in which there is

I8legitimate investment-backed expectation, which is one of
19the tests under the New York Central cases, that that is a
20legitimate investment-backed expectation that an ongoing
21 business, even if it suffers a loss, has to make some
22contributions, for example,

to health insurance or to

23unemployment insurance.

24

What is so unusual about this case is that it was

25a retroactive obligation,

that it was imposed in one lump

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sum and it was utterly unprecedented.
2

QUESTION*

But if the employer in Justice

3Rehnquist*s example said, well, as long as I operate I have
4 to live up to the law, but it is too expensive, I am going
5 to quit, and if he quit, it would be a different question if
6the government then said, well, you can quit but you are
7 going to have to pay your employees for a couple of years.
8

MR. MURRAY*

That would be a problem.

I think

9that is right.
10

QUESTION*

Well, that is what you claim your case.

11

MR. MURRAY*

Yes.

Right.

That's correct, Your

12 Honor .
13

The government has argued that the Rock Island has

14benefitted from the labor stability that was created in the
15case of the Rock Island, and we think this is belied by the
16record.

In the first place, there was a strike by the

l7employees of the Rock Island that was the proximate cause of
18its collapse.

But in any event, we would have to suggest

I9that the Rock Island had suffered massive losses over the
20five years of operation, and how it can be suggested that

21 the Rock Island benefitted in this particular situation is
22guite distinct in the record.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. MURRAY, ESQ.,

4

Counsel, you may resume.

ON BEHALF OF THE NON-FEDERAL APPELLEES - CONTINUED

5

MR. MURRAY:

6

This morning, I alluded to the decision of the

Thank you very much, Your Honor

7 Seventh Circuit court of appeals finding that there was no
81abor protection in the Rock Island abandonment situation,
9 and I would like to explain the reasoning that the Seventh
lOCircuit provided and the reasoning that we have stated in
Hour brief which was filed before the Seventh Circuit
12 decision.
13

Labor protection arose originally in connection

14 with mergers and consolidations, and the theory behind labor
15protection was that to the extent that a merger or
16 consolidation resulted in a savings for a particular ongoing
17 railroad, and jobs were lost in the process, those savings
18ought to be shared with the employees who lost their jobs.

19

Subsequently, Congress provided that labor

20protection should also be accorded in an abandonment
21 situation.

And in doing so. Congress cross-referenced the

22statute on abandonment with the statute on consolidations
23and mergers, and said that the labor protection that would
24be imposed in an abandonment situation would be the same as
25that imposed in a merger and consolidation situation.

49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

This

1 involved the payment of the so-called New York dock
2 conditions,

which were applied in a partial abandonment

3situation, the six years of labor protection, 80 percent of
4an employee's wages.

5

The ICC developed a consistent practice of

6exempting or declining to impose any labor protection in a
7 total abandonment situation, and when Congress recodified
8the Interstate Commerce Act, it indicated in the legislative
9history of the adoption of that statute that no change in
lOthe law developed by the ICC respecting total abandonments
11 was intended, and that same point was made when Congress
12 transferred authority over abandonments in bankruptcy
13situations from the ICC to the reorganization court, and I
14should note as an aside that in the Rock Island case it is
15the reorganization court, under Section 17 of the Milwaukee
16Road Restructuring Act, that has authority and discretion as
17to whether to impose labor protection in an abandonment
issituation.
19

But all the time that Congress was recodifying

2othese languages and amending it and transferring it, it
21 always referred back to the language of the statute that had
22been interpreted by the ICC as not requiring labor

23Protection in a total abandonment situation, and that is
24What the —

25

QUESTION*

Has the ICC ever said it was forbidden?

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

BE. MURRAY*

2impose it.

The ICC indicated that they would not

They did not say it was forbidden.

That is

3correct, Your Honor.
4

QUESTION*

Well, you are saying it is forbidden,

5aren’t you?
6

MR. MURRAY*

It is forbidden in the situation of a

71iquidation where the — under Brooks-Scanlon, where a
8railroad has operated at a loss consistently -9

QUESTION;

Well, the ICC has never said that.

10 Nobody has said that.
11

MR. MURRAY*

12

QUESTION*

13

MR. MURRAY*

That is correct, Your Honor.
That is a new question.
It has been indicated by Judge McGarr

I4in his abandonment order, and that is correct.

That is the

15one place it has been mentioned.
16

The particular vice of the Rock Island Transition

17Act is that it attempts to retroactively impose labor
18protection in a situation where the Rock Island has already
19been adjudicated entitled to liquidate.

This is not a

20situation where Congress is trying to enact legislation

that

21 will apply to all railroads or all railroads that

22subsequently enter into liquidation -- into reorganization.
2311 applies only to the situation where -- only the situation
24of the Rock

Island after it has been adjudicated entitled to

25liquidate.

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The vice of this kind of retroactive legislation

2 in part is that it impacts upon the creditors and the
3 shareholders of the Eock Island, because they made their
4investment in the railroad industry on the understanding
5that under this consistent ICC practice that it developed
6over the years, there would be no labor protection imposed
7in a total liquidation situation, that there would come a
Spoint —
9

QUESTION:

But that is true of all investors in

10any corporation prior to 1938 and the passage of the Fair
11 Labor Standards Act, isn't it?

They made their investment

12with the understanding that the company could pay its help
I3as little as it could get by with.
14

HR. KURRAY;

It's true that that was the situation

I5with the Fair Labor Standards Act, but what we are saying
16here is that this is a substantial obligation that is being
l7imposed upon this particular railroad estate that has
18already served the public interest five years with $210

igmillion.

In an ordinary situation, if a corporation, a

2onon-railroad went into bankruptcy, it would just go into
21 straight liquidation.

There would be no requirement that it

22continue in operation for five years with $210 million of
23losses.
24

What is special about this case is that under

25Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, because a railroad has a

52
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 partial public service obligation, this railroad has been
2reguired to continue operations, unlike any other
3 corporation, has been required to continue operations for
4five years with immense losses, and it has served the public
5interest totally, and it can give no more to the public
6interest.

That is the meaning of Judge McGarr's liquidation

7order of January 25, 1980, and that is the distinction from
8any other non-railroad corporation under the Fair Labor
9Standards Act.
10

QUESTIONS

What if Congress in 1970, say, prior to

11 the Milwaukee liquidation, prior to the Pock Island
12 liquidation, had said affirmatively, there will be labor
13benefit programs for all railroads that subsequently go into
14 liquidation?
15

MR. MURRAY;

That would clearly be a more

16difficult case for us.

It would -- there would not be the

17same degree of retroactivity that exists in this particular
18case.

This case is exacerbated by the fact that it occurred

19after the reorganization entered its liquidation phase, and
20the relevance of that point is that during the course of

21 reorganization, this railroad amassed $250 million of
22expenses of administration.

These are administrative

23claimants, small businesses, various group — companies that
24dealt with the Rock Island on the assumption —

25

QUESTION;

Lawyers?

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

(General laughter.)

2

MR. MURRAY*

Anybody, that would be on the

3assumption that they would be entitled to priority under the
4Railroad Reorganization Statute, under Section 77, and under
5the very first order that Judge McGarr entered in the case.
6

Now, Congress, after the liquidation, is

7 attempting to impose a claim that is either on the same
8plane with or prior to that, but it is going to have the
9effect of displacing or diluting those administrative
10claims, people who relied upon the provisions of Section 77
11 with respect to the priority of expenses of administration,
I2and that will have an impact upon — if Congress can
13 constitutionally impose such a prior claim at the twelfth
14hour, you know, in the course of liquidation, that will have
I5an impact upon the ability of the courts to conduct
16reorganizations where there is a precarious financial
izsituation for a particular railroad or any company, for that
18matter,

because the possibility always exists then that

igCongress could come along, enact a new statute, and displace
20the interests of the expense of administration claimants.

21

QUESTION;

Well, are you really suggesting that

22the state is so depleted that it would not cover all
23administrative expenses, including the $75 million if it is

24imposed?
25

QUESTION!

Or do you know?

2

MR. MURRAY;

We do have some idea, Your Honor,

3 that at the present time there are $250 million of expense
4 of administration claims.

There are between principal and

5interest, somewhere around $75 million of claims of first
6mortgage bondholders, and the sales that have been made to
7date have been minimal.
8

QUESTION;

So what is the estate valued at?

9

MR. MURRAY;

At the present time, the escrow fund

10amounts to approximately $130, $135 million, and there are
11 no major sales pending.
12

QUESTION;

But there certainly is a liquidation

13value on the remaining assets.
14

MR. MURRAY;

15

QUESTION;

16them, I guess.
17

We have -Except you can't find any value in

Is that it?

MR. MURRAY;

That's correct. Your Honor.

It is

18very difficult to --

19

QUESTION;

So you are really saying if $75 million

20is imposed, it will — if it is going to be paid in toto, it
21 necessarily will be a priority administrative expense, and
22 will dilute the other claimants to administrative expenses.

23

MR. MURRAY;

At least dilute them, and perhaps

24displace them, depending upon the priority that is accorded
25by the reorganization court.

55
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Murray, how realistic is the $75

2million figure?
3

MR. MURRAY;

Your Honor, we have in the record an

4affidavit by the trustee indicating that assuming 3,700
5eligible employees -- this appears at Page 122A of the joint
6appendix -- there would be an immediate payout of $46
7million and a total payout of $69 million.

That was

8calculated in — based upon figures that were available in
9December of 1979, assuming 3,700 eligible employees.
10

Subsequently, it appears that there are even fewer

11 employees who have been employed by other railroads, and
12therefore the number is expected to be higher, so it would
13appear in all likelihood that it would be the full $75
14 million.
15

QUESTION;

Counsel, assuming that the Court were

16to find that it was not a taking for a private purpose,

the

17railroad could then, would you concede, recover that amount

I8that it paid out under the Tucker Act?
19

MR. MURRAY;

Well, assuming that it could not be

20 — that this was not a — for a private purpose, we would -21 we would say that there was still irreparable harm to the
22Rock Island estate,

because this estate is in the process of

23withdrawing from the rail service and from the public
24service, and the effect that would have is to prevent a

25Partial distribution that the reorganization court wants to

56
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1make to ths expense of administration claimants.
2

QUESTIONf

How long would it take to process a

3Tucker Act claim?
4

MR. MURRAY*

It has taken — this Act was passed

5over a year ago, and it has taken a year to litigate this.
61 would imagine it would take at least a year or two years,
7assuming the government raises certain defenses, and there
8 is a question about the amount.
9

QUESTION*

So what really is the problem is that

lOit delays a partial distribution.
11

MR. MURRAY*

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

I2real problem here is with the cost of administration -13

QUESTION*

The harm will be the difference between

the interest rate that you would get on your Tucker Act
claim and what you could do with your money if you got it
now .
17

MR. MURRAY*

Your Honor, the problem there is that

I8there are -- there are cost of administration claimants, as
19 Judge McGarr found, who can't afford to wait for their
20money.

These are people, businesses who dealt with the

21 trustee as they would deal with any other ongoing business,
22assuming they would be paid, and what happened in September
23of 1979, when the strike occurred, and when the Rock Island
24became cashless, is that it was unable to pay those expenses
25 of administration that would be paid in any case, and those

57
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 people are now being deferred.
2

Judge McGarr indicated that he receives letters

3each week from these people, who are very necessitous,
4including local governments and state —
5

QUESTION:

Why could the partial distribution not

6be made?
7

MR. MURRAY:

Because the escrow fund is not large

Senough to cover both the first mortgage bonds and the $75
9million lien that would be imposed upon the estate, and that
lOis why he is not able to proceed, and he has so indicated to
11 the various cost of administration claimants who come to his
12court on each status report date asking when are they going
13to be paid.

It is because the amount of this lien that is

14overhanging the Rock Island estate and will overhang it if
15it waits until a Tucker Act claim is prosecuted, that makes
I6it impossible to make that partial distribution.
17

QUESTION:

What about a partial pro-rata

l8distribution?
19

MR. MURRAY:

Your Honor, the difficulty with that

2ois that again, the escrow fund is not large enough to cover
21 both the first mortgage bondholders and this $75 million, so
22that there would be nothing left at that point, or just a
23miniscule amount left for the expense of administration

24 claimants.
25

QUESTION:

What is the priority between

58
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 administrative expenses and the first mortgage bondholders?
2

MR. MURRAY;

Your Honor, that has not been

3 adjudica ted by the reorganization court.

It is a very

4 complicated question, and I am sure that is going to take
5 quite a bit of time in the reorganization court.

It would

6appear in some aspects, some aspects of the expense of
/administration claims are subordinate to the first mortgage
8 bondholders , but -9

QUESTION;

But a lot of them are not, to the

lOextent the first mortgage bondholders have profited by it.
11

MR. MURRAY;

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. MURRAY;

Again -If ever.
I would have to say that I think that

l4most of the first mortgage bonds would be prior to the cost
15 of administration claimants, but that is a question under
16Section 77, and Judge McGarr has not ruled upon that, and
17you would get different answers to that question from
18different --

19

QUESTION;

And need not do so if the fund were

20large enough to cover both.

21

MR. MURRAY;

That's correct.

And the problem

22there, of course, is, you would get different answers to
23that question from different counsel for whom I am speaking
24today, so I should make that clear.

25

<Je are concerned, of course, in connection with

1 the Tucker Act remedy, that it may not be available here
2because it is a taking for private benefit of the employees,
3former employees of the Pock Island, and we believe does not

The government and the RLEA has

5tried to indicate that some public purpose is served by
6this, but we are suggesting that the payments that are going
7 to be made are not payments -8

QUESTION;

Counsel, would you say that in the case

9of an ongoing enterprise or even a reorganization of the
iQrailroad, that for the government to impose such liability
11 would also lack a public purpose?
12

MR. MURRAY;

In that particular situation. Your

13Honor, because the railroad remains in the railroad
14business, I think it would be a harder question.

I mean,

15that would be a -- in fact, the court has held in RLEA
16versus ICC that it is a -17

QUESTION;

Yes, it was my understanding we really

18have upheld legislation of that kind.
19

MR. MURRAY:

That is correct. Your Honor, but

20there the thought is that it -- the rationale there is the

21 connection between the fact that an ongoing railroad profits
22from the partial abandonment that is effected, and that the
23Congress can regulate the sharing of that profit with
24employees who are displaced because only a few employees
25have to bear the burden for which the entire railroad

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 profits
2

QUESTION:

How do you deal with the argument that

3 presumably the investors and the railroad understood that
4 some liability might well attach in any event under the
5other Act that was in force, the Milwaukee Act?
6

MR. MURRAY;

Well, I think they understood it to

7 mean that if the -- I think they understood Brooks-Scanlon
8and the cases that have followed Brooks-Scanlon, like New
9Haven Inclusion, to say that if a railroad operates at a
lOloss consistently over the years, they have a right to
11 withdraw their investment from rail service, and that cannot
12be subject to conditions such as that Congress tried to
13 attach here.
14

I think that is really the bottom line in terms of

15the constitutional right, that they assumed they could
16withdraw their investment, and they assumed that that could
17not be conditioned by the imposition of a large labor
18 protection claim, particularly in light of the consistent
19ICC interpretation of the abandonment statutes.
20

I want to address very briefly the question of the

21 problem

of this law as a non-uniform law in bankruptcy,

22because

I think that is a matter that is of concern to us

23this particular
24is that

situation.

in

One of the aspects of this law

it does not attempt to generally amend Section 77

25the Bankruptcy Act to apply to all railroads, and it does

61

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

of

1 not attempt even to deal with all railroads that are now
2currently in Section 77.
3

It applies only to one railroad, which is the Rock

4Island Railroad, and the difficulty we have with that is, of
5course, that it permits Congress to tamper with an
6individual bankrupt estate, and we think that that -- the
7vice of that is that we think there is some protection that
8exists in the uniform law on bankruptcy clause of the
9 Constitution, because the framers required that legislation
lOfor one must apply to all, and it prevents some tampering
11 with one individual railroad estate, and that is -12

QUESTION:

Was the Milwaukee reorganized out of

13the Northern District of Illinois?
14

MR. MURRAY:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

15 But the Milwaukee is in a different situation.

Yes, it is.
In fact, the

16way the Act applied to the Milwaukee Railroad case was quite
17different than the way it applied to the Rock Island case.
18The Milwaukee was, when the Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring

igAct was enacted, and is now an ongoing railroad, and of
20course there was a partial abandonment labor protection
2lliability there.

We don't have that situation here.

When

220ur Act was enacted, we had already been adjudicated
23entitled to liquidate.

24

The government argues that this is a law affecting

25commerce and therefore they are not bound by the uniformity

62
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 requirement of the bankruptcy power in the Constitution.
2 The difficulty with this argument, I think, is that -- is
3twofold.

On the one hand, Congress — almost every

4 bankruptcy law attempts -- involves in some way interstate
5 commerce, I think one would have to say, and secondly, we
6think that just as the -- we think that the commerce power
7 is qualified by other more specific constitutional
8provisions, and we think that is the case here.
9 more specific constitutional provision.

This is a

Any law on

lObankruptcy must in some sense be uniform.

If a bankruptcy

11 Act can apply only to one railroad, that seems to us to
12suggest that the uniformity clause really doesn't have any
I3meaning any longer.
14

Another concern that this particular Act raises is

15 the disregard for the doctrine of separation of powers, and
16in that particular connection I should note that this
17particular legislation compells Judge McGarr to enter an

l8order without any exercise of his own discretion, just
19 immedia tely preceding the date on which he was scheduled to
20enter his decision on the particular matter.
21

In a sense, this particular legislation dictated

22the decision only days before the decision was to be made.
23 It is thus like United States versus Klein.

It is unlike Ex

24Parte KcCardle, because there was no attempt to withdraw
25 jurisdiction.

They simply imposed a particular rule of

63
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 decision on Judge McGarr.
2

QUESTION:

But if Congress had added a bottom line

3 and said, by the way, to the extent the Bankruptcy Acts must

4 be amended to achieve the above, they are so amended?
5

MR. MURRAY*

I don’t believe they did that,

6though, Your Honor.
7

QUESTION*

If they had, there would be no

8separation of powers problem, would there?
9

MR. MURRAY*

lOrailroads, and did it in connection with this -11

12means it has to be uniform.

13for that.

MR. MURRAY:

It wouldn't, but in this particular

They said that the decision that the ICC would

22enter would be one that was fair and equitable, but they
23define that to mean, whatever happened in the Milwaukee Road
24must happen here.

Of course, the two are utterly unalike.

2

ME. MURRAY:

Your Honor, we have cited the United

3 States versus Klein case.

I would say that it is very rare

4that Congress has enacted a piece of legislation in this
5 circumstance.
6

QUESTION:

My question is, are there any

7 precedents that you can -8

MR. MURRAY:

The Klein case is the one precedent

9 on which we rely.
10

QUESTION:

Only the Klein case?

11

MR. MURRAY:

We are particularly concerned about

12the way this particular Act operates when you combine the
l3uniformity point that it operates only on one particular
l4railroad, and the fact that it operates on the eve of when
15the court was to make a decision, and precludes a court's
l6decision on a matter that is then pending and about to be
17decided.

We think that raises very grave constitutional

18 questions.
19

QUESTION:

Mr. Murray, are there any specific

20 authorities that truly resolve the question of whether this

21 particular Act may be said to be an Act of bankruptcy, the

Your Honor, our concern there is with

22Purpose.

It doesn't serve any specific public

It doesn't benefit the Rock Island in any way,

23because the Rock Island has no pre-existing claim in our
24view.

Therefore, we are concerned that the government could

25raise the defense at the time of the Tucker Act proceeding

67
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1that it was not an appropriate matter under ther Tucker Set.

2

All the Staggers Act says is that a Tucker Act

3remedy -- nothing in this Act shall preclude or limit a
4Tucker Act remedy.

It does not say whether in fact a Tucker

5 Act remedy exists.

It is very careful not to say that.

The

61egislation is very careful not to say that particular point.
7

The government in their brief indicates that there

8are situations where a Tucker Act remedy would not be
9available.

For example, where there is no legislative

10authority for a particular taking, they say that that would
11 not be an appropriate remedy under the Tucker Act.
12

What we are saying here is that there may also be

13 — there is no direct precedent on the point, but they may
14also raise the defense that this is not serving a
l5governmental public purpose, and therefore there is no right
16to bring an action for compensation under the Tucker Act,
I7and we won't know that until a later date, which will be of
18— preclude any remedy to us.

We are not granted the Tucker

19Act remedy by that Act.

QUESTION:

Who would litigate the Tucker Act

Would the trustee do it, or would creditors, or

22who ?

I would assume that the trustee would

Of course, if

25there is no Tucker Act remedy, then the money is paid out to

6and I believe they are very careful in their brief, as I

QUESTION:

Are you concerned that they might make

9that kind of defense, notwithstanding the argument they made
lOhere today?
11

MR. MURRAY:

Yes, Your Honor, I would have concern

l2about that, but there is also the point that there is
13 irreparable harm to the Rock Island in that an estate which
14has already been existent in reorganization for five years,
I5with immense losses, and all of these costs of
16administration claims, that is going to be prolonged for
l7another several years while the Tucker Act claim is being
18prosecuted, and there is no reason for that.

There might

19have been a reason for that in the Three R Act cases, where
20the government had to see specific property to maintain rail
21 service in the northeast.

Here we are talking about

22fungible money that could just as well come from the
23Qovernment if in fact any public purpose is being served -24we don't think there is -- it could just as well come from
25the government as it could come from a bankrupt estate.

You have three minutes

MR. CLARKE:

Okay.

12

The one point that has been — seems to be focused

Now, we submit that the rationale given by the

17creditors for what is the purpose, the whole purpose behind
iSlabor protection misses the mark.

I9case and then in the ICC versus the Railway Labor
20Executives' Association case, stresse that the only

18say that.

MR. CLARKE;

Brooks-Scanlon doesn't, Your Honor,

20but the New Haven case, I believe the Penn Central merger

2land the Denver and Rio Grande case, which we have cited in
22our brief, indicate that the Brooks-Scanlon doctrine is
23Qualified by the fact that although a railroad cannot be
24allowed to continue indefinitely at a loss, there can be a
25reasonable period of time while the public solution, public

1 interest solution is found, and we submit the difference
2 that we have with the creditors and the trustee on this is
3 that part of the public interest solution that has to be
4found here is how do you provide for a stabilized labor
5 f orce .
6

Now, the ICC case goes on to indicate that the

7Loudon case specifically recoqnized that the imposition of
8conditions similar to those sought here might strengthen the
9national system through their effect on the morale and
10stability of railway workers generally.

Exactly the same

11 considerations of national importance are applicable and
l2operative here, and we submit they are applicable and
13operative here as well because the entire purpose of labor
14protection is not just for Rock Island people, it is for all
15railroad employees.
16

Mr. Murray has indicated that the railway system

17is a national community type of establishment.

What happens

18 to -- what happens to one railroad here affects another
l9railroad, either through direct intercourse of commerce or
20through the passing of the word of mouth.

21

If employees know that if the railroad goes

22bankrupt and they are going to be cut out in the cold unless
23they are lucky enough to get a job with somebody else, why
24should a railroad employee stay with any other carrier today
25that is in financial problems?

It is because of that

1 consideration and the need to continue railroad workers on
2their jobs, and have that supply available, that this
3continues.

This is exactly what the Act did.

I realize my time is up.
