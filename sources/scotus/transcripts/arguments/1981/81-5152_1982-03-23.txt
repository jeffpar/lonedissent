ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. BENO, ESQ.

6
7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BENOs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

8 this honorable Court:
9

This case comes out of the State of Alabama in

10 reference to an arrest made on January 4, 1979.

Now,

11 the background, which I think is very important in all
12 criminal cases, especially when the Fourth Amendment is
13 involved, of the facts and circumstances applicable to
14 the record generally turn — make the case turn one way
15 or the other.
16

Now, there was a robbery, without question, on

17 the 2nd day of December, 1978.

Subsequent to that time,

18 in the middle days of December a Charles Martin

was

19 arrested in reference to a completely different and
20 separate rape and robbery, and he was in the county —
21 or in the city jail in Montgomery, Alabama.
22

QUESTION:

Do you acknowledge that whoever

23 committed the robbery at the supermarket that you have
24 just described left some fingerprints there?
25

MR. BENO:

There's no argument to that effect,

3

1 Your Honor.

In fact, one issue here is whether or not

2 — there are several — how many people were involved in
3 the robbery.
4

Initially —

QUESTIONS

Well,

today we're only really

5 concerned about one of them, aren't we.

MR. BENOs

7 confession,

right.

The fingerprints and the
And at the trial we didn't argue and

8 did not move to suppress the fingerprints taken from the
9 hotdogs and the package of sugar.

That's not at issue

10 here.
11

The point here today is whether or not, first

12 of all, there was an illegal arrest.
13 issue,

That's a critical

because if there's no illegal arrest there's no

14 need to be in front of the Court today.
15

We have a situation where Mr. Martin said to

16 the police officer, Mr. Mobley -- I think if you'll
17 refer to the record at page 7 of the record,

his

18 statement to the court was that he had heard — that's
19 not in the appendix, that's in

the record -- he had

20 heard.
21

At which time I moved or I objected, and there

22 was a discussion in front of the court and in front of
23 the officer, and during that discussion
24 to the conclusion and stated that, well,
25 this,

the judge came
I think that

what he heard from someone else, if it cannot be

2 credibility upon which an arrest can follow.
Hell, if you’ll notice, on page 15 — no, on

4 page

13 of the record,

after this discussion is over we

5 come back and

we ask Hr. Hobley another question, and

6 now he says.*

"Well, I don’t know where he got it.

I

7 don’t know where he got it."
8

This certainly — the element of credibility

9 is involved

here.

Once in front of the court and the

10 court has said that, well, just hearing this is not
11 sufficient, it appears that his testimony changes.

I

12 think that’s critical, because credibility is very
13 important when this court decides this case.
14

At any rate --

15

QUESTION;

16 second?

May I interrupt you for just a

The question presented that you framed in your

17 brief is whether or not a confession taken from
18 Petitioner following a warrantless arrest based on less

19 than probable cause.

20

MR. BENO:

That’s correct.

21

QUESTION;

And so you — for purposes of our

22 consideration of the case, do we assume there was less
23 than probable cause?
24

MR. BENO;

That’s correct.

That’s what I’m

25 getting ready to show you.

QUESTION

Yes

2

MR. BENOi

Now, Mr. Martin, who was as I said

3 an alleged -- or a suspect in a separate and completely
4 different rape and robbery, was then questioned at the
5 police station by Mr. Mobley, all right.

Now, he said,

6 and it's on the record, that he had heard such and
7 such.
8

The court then said:

Well, hearsay is fine if

9 it’s credible and can be substantiated or give some
10 credibility in reference to the statement.
11 question was asked

Well, the

to Mr. Mobley, was there anything

12 that you can base your credibility or you can give
13 credit -- credibility to the informant?

Well, Your

14 Honor, all he told me was that he had heard.

He did not

15 tell me who he heard it from or how he got this
16 knowledge.
17

I would suggest, based on that and quite

18 frankly until this brief by Petitioner -- I mean, by
19 Respondent — it has never been argued

20 probable cause.

that there was

In fact, at the oral argument in front

21 of the Supreme Court of Alabama he readily admitted that
22 there was no probable cause.
23

In fact, one of the judges at that time

24 indicated that,

well, I was kind of thinking about

25 reversing this case,

but if you admit that there's no

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) S54-2345

1 probable cause I'm going to have a little bit more
2 difficulty.

Well, now he suggests, and he tries to

3 gloss over this failure to produce probable cause by
4 saying that, well, we did have probable cause perhaps.
5

He says that this Hr. Martin was a suspect in

6 the robbery at Moseley's Grocery Store at that time.
7 Hell, the record indicates that the only reason he was a
8 suspect is because he was arrested on some other
9 robberies.

And another time in the record he says,

10 well, he was a suspect to me.
11 reason on which to base his

He never indicates any

suspicion that Mr. Martin

12 was even a suspect, other than the fact that he was in
13 jail on another crime.
14

I don't believe that can be sufficient

15 evidence on which to give credibility.

MR. BEND;

Simply that he knew that Omar

What was the

Nothing further to indicate any

21 amount of credibility.

22

Dunaway falls very close to this case in

23 reference to

the fact that there was no evidence on

24 which to substantiate the testimony or

the statement mde

25 by the alleged individual incarcerated.

Now, a lot of

Tell me, why are you arguing -- are

you arguing that there was no probable cause?
MR. BENO*

Right.

And why are you doing that?

MR. BENO*

Well, if there's probable cause —

MR. BENO*

14

MR. BENO;

No.

15

QUESTION;

Do you think that that is open to

16

the Respondent to make that claim here?
MR. BENO;

18

argue that.

Well, I know that he is going to

I'll move along.

Assuming that there is no probable cause, then

19

20 we come to the point in fact of the arrest.
21

QUESTION*

Yes.

22

MR. BENO;

All right.

23

QUESTION*

What are you relying on for the

24

proposition that there’s no probable cause, Aguilar and

25

Spinelli?

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BEND;

Aguilar and Spinelli.

There's also

2 an Alabama case which I argued originally, Berry.
3

QUESTION;

Hell, presumably that’s not open to

4 you if that's a state law.
5

MR. BEND;

I understand.

But under Aguilar

6 and under the petition filed by the Defendant, he states
7 clearly that Aguilar and Spinelli are involved here.
8 And on brief by the amicus curiae raised this also.
9

QUESTION;

Well, but Aguilar and Spinelli were

10 both warrant cases, weren't they?

There was no warrant

11 here.

12

MR. BENO;

They spell out the necessary basis

13 for the credibility of the informant.
14

QUESTION;

To be supplied to a neutral

15 magistrate.

MR. BENO;

That's correct.

QUESTION;

But here you're not talking about a

You don't even have that here.

19

20 understand that.
21

I

I agree with you on that, Your Honor.

Now, Omar Taylor was arrested following this

22 information, without a warrant, which makes it different

23 from Dunaway in that in Dunaway the Justices, I believe
24 Mr. Burger, Chief Justice Burger, indicated that, well,
25 I'm not so sure that this wasn't a consent to follow the

1 police officer to the station
2

We certainly don't have that issue in the

3 present case.

We have no issue — there’s no question

4 but that he was arrested at the time he was taken into
5 custody by the police.
6

In fact, he was handcuffed.

Sow we come to the question under Dunaway and

7 under Brown.

There are three temporal — I mean, there

8 are three circumstances which the court would look to.
9 Certainly, the temporal proximity is involved, and Hr.
10 Justice Stevens in Dunaway indicated that that is an
11 ambiguous term in that certainly the longer an

12 individual is incarcerated, considering the facts and
13 circumstances of his incarceration can not — will not
14 necessarily dilute the detention, but will only increase
15 the confusion on the part of the incarcerated
16 individual.
17

I think it’s clear here that the Defendant was

18 -- or the Petitioner was questioned at least three
19 times,

perhaps four;

that he was fingerprinted prior to

20 being placed in a lineup.

Now, it's interesting in

21 discussing the fingerprinting that you ruled in Davis v.
22 Mississippi that under narrowly defined circumstances
23 perhaps the limits of probable cause can be

removed to

24 some extent.
25

QUESTION;

Was he fingerprinted again after

10

1 that occasion?
2

MR. BENO:

After the arrest.

3

QUESTION:

Was he fingerprinted a second

MR. BENO:

He was not — he was indeed — yes,

4 time?
5

6 he was indeed fingerprinted.

At the trial he was

7 fingerprinted.

8

QUESTION:

Well, those were the only

9 fingerprints that were introduced.

10

MR. BENO:

That’s correct.

11

QUESTION:

Well, why were the fingerprints

12 taken immediately after arrest excluded?

They were

13 excluded?
14

MR. BENO:

They were excluded.

15

QUESTION:

Why?

16

MR. BENO:

Under Mississippi versus Davis.

17 And under Mississippi —
18

QUESTION:

And the trial court then ruled

19 that. A, there was no probable cause for arrest —
20

MR. BENO:

That’s correct.

21

QUESTION:

That the fingerprints

were

22 excludable as the fruits of an illegal arrest —
23

MR. BENO:

That’s correct.

24

QUESTION:

And then the AlabamaSupreme Court

25 holds that the taint has been removed.

1

ME. BENO

Well, quite frankly —

2

QUESTION:

Is that right?

3

MR. BENO:

That's what they ruled.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, that's what — but the trial

6 the holding that there was no probable cause?

MR. BENO:

No, they indicate that.

QUESTION:

11 ruling that

They didn't disagree with the

the first set of fingerprints were fruit of

12 an illegal arrest?
13

MR. BENO.-

They did not.

14

QUESTION:

Yes .

15

MR. BENO:

It's interesting that the Alabama

16 Supreme Court basically said in its opinion that they
17 were rather discouraged by

the exclusionary rule, and

18 that they were just, quite frankly, not going to follow
19 it.

That is basically what they said, because they did

20 not delineate the reasons upon which they reversed the
21 case.

They did not delineate the factors on which they

22 overturned the case.
23

Going a little bit further now, it's

24 interesting in the fact that in
25 that perhaps there

Davis you all indicated

will be a case in which the

12

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

fingerprints on less than probable cause can be

2 permitted.

But this case is not the one, because the

3 individual was fingerprinted twice, he was questioned on
4 at least — at least questioned during that period of
5

time.

In other words, they did not arrest him or pick

6 him up specifically to get the fingerprints and then
7

match them up.
I cited in my brief M.B. v. State of New

8
9

Jersey, a New Jersey case, In Be the Fingerprinting of

10 M.B., which seemed to fall within the confines of what
11

you all consider reasonable under Davis.

In other

12

words, they went to a magistrate and indicated that we

13

have the possibility of determining the murderer of an

14

eighth grade child, because we found a ring which has a

fingerprint on it.

MR. BENO;

Well, I'll explain something to

that it's so important.

In Dunaway you all talk

20 about the flagrancy, purpose and flagrancy of the police
21 conduct,

all right.

You discuss the fact that when the

22 police conduct is excessively flagrant the intervening
23 circumstances perhaps should be

more credible.

At any rate, there's no question in this case
that there were an illegal arrest, three cases of,

It is my position that in reference to the

9 same, that the flagrancy of the police conduct, which
10 appears to be under Dunaway what you all were looking
11 at, mainly because of temporal proximity can be

12 ambiguous.

But the flagrancy in this case is that the

13 police had two weeks between the time they got this
14 information and the time they went and got and picked up
15 the Defendant to make a determination of whether or not

16 thare was probable cause.
17

There are no exigent circumstances in this

18 case. Your Honor.
19 which

There are no exigent circumstances in

to determine that they can go out and pick up this

20 individual.

They had plenty of time to go before a

21 magistrate and ask the question of whether or not there

22 was probable cause.
23

QUESTION;

Well, but if a magistrate issued a

24 warrant for his arrest, I presume you would have argued
25 that it was subject to attack.

MR. BENO;

Hell, I’m just trying to point out

that — and maybe I should hold this for response —

that the Petitioner — or the Respondent in this case is

going to argue that there may have been probable cause.

there certainly was not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. ALLISON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ALLISON;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
Prior to the trial in Omar Taylor’s case, a

23

pretrial motion to suppress the confession and to

24

declare the arrest illegal was filed.

25

hearing was held and much testimony taken.

A full-blown

1 of this hearing the trial judge denied this motion and
2 found the confession admissible on the —
3

QUESTION;

But the court found that the

4 fingerprints were inadmissible and had to be suppressed,
5 right?
6

HR. ALLISON:

The fingerprint issue arose in

7 the trial, and the very first time that the fingerprint
8 issue came up, on page 20 of the record, the trial judge
9 says:

Now, then you come along and you say that you

10 object to the fingerprints because of the illegal arrest
11 and because of the language of Davis v. Mississippi.

12 And the content in which the fingerprints were objected
13 to was the admissibility of the fingerprint comparison

14 in the trial of the case.
15

This is the first time that the fingerprint

16 issue was argued.
17

QUESTION:

18 presumably,
19

Well, weren't they kept out,

because the arrest was illegal?

MR. ALLISON:

The reason that the trial judge

20 suppressed those fingerprints and ordered him
21 re-fingerprinted was that he considered, apparently, the

22 arrest based on less than probable cause.
23

QUESTION;

Right.

And didn't you — didn't

24 the State virtually concede that at the time, that there
25 was no probable cause?

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ALLISONs

Reading the arguments of the

2 district attorney, he attempts to establish probable
3 cause, but concedes that the arrest was based on less
4 than probable cause.
5

QUESTION;

Yes, and so everybody assumed at

6 the trial court level there was no probable cause and

7 the confession came in under the Dunaway concept,

isn't

8 that basically right?
9

MR. ALLISONs

Your Honor, that's correct.

10 That is exactly what the trial judge said.
11

There are

circumstances under Dunaway that would make this

12 confession admissible.

13

QUESTIONS

Intervening circumstances.

14

MR. ALLISONs

15

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

But it was not a fruit of an

16 illegal arrest.
17

MR. ALLISON:

No, sir.

There were certain

18 attenuation factors that I will compare shortly.
19

QUESTION:

Now, the state didn't appeal that

20 finding of no probable cause.
21

MR. ALLISON:

On argument before the Court of

22 Criminal Appeals the State argued that there was
23 probable cause, and the Court of Criminal Appeals
24 rejected that argument.
25

QUESTION;

And you never appealed the trial

MR. ALLISON;

No, Your Honor, there was no

QUESTION;

So presumably that issue is at

So do we not have to assume, then, that the

6 arrest was illegal?
7

MR. ALLISON;

Was based on less than probable

8 cause.
9

QUESTION;

Yes.

10

QUESTION;

Well,

but youalso have with

you

11 the favorable ruling on the pretrial suppression motion,
12 which refused to exclude the confession, did you not?
13

MR. ALLISON;

14

QUESTION;

Yes, sir, that's true.

And that was appealed as a part of

15 the Defendant’s appeal to the Court of Appeals?
16

MR. ALLISON;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. ALLISON;

19

QUESTION;

To the Alabama appellate court.

Yes.
Yes, sir.

Thatwasn'tbased on the notion

20 that there was probable cause, was it?
21

MR. ALLISON;

The one issue that the Court of

22 Criminal Appeals considered was, is a voluntarily given
23 confession admissible in an instance where there is less
24 than probable cause.

And what the Alabama appellate

25 court did was to look at Dunaway and Brown and to weigh

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the facts, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals
2 found nothing to distinguish Omar Taylor's case from
3 Brown and Dunaway.

4

Then on appeal the Alabama Supreme Court

5 reviewed the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal

6 Appeals.

The Alabama Supreme Court found that the

7 causal connection between the illegal risk and the
8 confession had been sufficiently broken, and that any
9 taint of an illegal arrest had been sufficiently
10 attenuated by the three factors as set forth in Brown

11 and Dunaway.
12

And what I would first like to do is to look

13 at these three factors as set forth in Brown and
14 Dunaway, and to see the correctness of the decision of
15 the Alabama Supreme Court.
16

The three factors:

First of all, the first factor is the temporal

17 proximity of the arrest and the confession.
18 Brown and Dunaway,

In both

the Defendant was arrested and had

19 confessed in less than two hours.
20 there was a period of six hours.

In Taylor's case
And in order to show

21 the importance of the six-hour period, we have to look
22 at the circumstances that occurred.

23

We know that there are four things that

24 occurred during this period of time, and we know the
25 approximate time, or the record shows the approximate

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 time in three of these.

When Omar Taylor was arrested

2 at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon and taken directly to the
3 police station, the first thing that happened, he was
4 processed.

He was fingerprinted, he was photographed,

5 and by his own statement they talked to him for 15
6 minutes.
7
8 lineup.

He know then that he was taken directly to a
According to Omar Taylor’s estimate, this

9 lineup lasted one hour.

Then, ten minutes later,

10 Detective Wilson read him his Miranda rights and
11 confronted him with the fingerprint comparison.

While

12 he was being placed in the lineup, the police officers
13 had taken the latent print from the crime scene, they
14 had compared them with these roll prints, and he was
15 confronted with these prints and he declined to make any
16 statement.
17

He was then placed in his cell.

Then Omar

18 Taylor says, that afternoon I talked to my girlfriend
19 and I confessed.

But it was not the girl -- but it was

20 not that afternoon.

If you look at the record, his

21 confession came at 9:00 p.m. that night.
22

So if you add up this time between 3:00 p.m.

23 and 9:00 p.m. that night, some six hours, the activities
24 that occurred immediately after his arrest consumed some
25 two and a half hours, approximately, or three hours at

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the most.

But this leaves a three-hour period, and this

2 is important, I think, from the length of time, because
3 during this period he sat in the solitude of his cell.
4 He had an opportunity to compose his thoughts and to
5 ensure that the confession was a product of his free
6 will.
7

The second factor to be considered,

8 intervening circumstances.
9 were none.

In Brown and Dunaway there

But I think there are several circumstances

10 that are significant and should be considered.
11 all,

First of

I use the period of solitude in his cell as an

12 example to show what happened to him during this
13 six-hour period.

But I think as an intervening

14 circumstance we would have to consider this period of
15 solitude in his cell.
16

His Miranda rights were read to him or given

17 to him on three occasions, and

18 minutes before he confessed.
19 grade student,

the final time was just
Omar Taylor was a twelfth

and just before making his confession the

20 police also read him his Miranda rights.

He gave him a

21 copy, Omar Taylor read it and signed the waiver of
22 rights form.
23

Another intervening circumstance is the visit

24 between Omar Taylor’s girlfriend and neighbor.

There is

25 a difference in the versions of exactly what happened

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 when you look at the record.

Omar Taylor gives a

2 different version from that of the police officer.
3

Recording to the police officer, at 8;50 p.m.

4 that night he took Omar Taylor out of his cell, read him
5 his Miranda rights, and had been talking to him for
6 approximately ten minutes.

At that time Omar Taylor's

7 girlfriend and neighbor arrived.
8 Omar Taylor.
9

She wanted to talk to

Omar Taylor wanted to talk to her.

So the police officer allowed them to have a

10 private conversation in the detective's office.
11 this private conversation,

12 Omar Taylor confessed.

After

approximately ten minutes,

But I think that as an

13 intervening circumstance you would have to consider the

14 conversation, in which Omar Taylor was free to discuss
15 anything in the privacy there with a person with whom he
16 was very closely associated.
17

And the last intervening circumstance which is

18 given weight by the

Alabama Supreme Court -- and this is

19 prior to the confession — an arrest warrant was

20 obtained based on an affidavit that the officers made.
21 This affidavit included information about the

22 fingerprint information.

The arrest warrant was issued

23 prior to the confession.
24
25 exclude

During the exclusion — during the motion to
the confession, this evidence pertaining to the

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 issuance of the search warrant was before the trial
2 judge.

During this hearing the information was placed

3 before him that these fingerprints were used as a basis
4 for the warrant.

There was no specific objection on

5 this point.
6

The first time that the fingerprint issue

7 arose was in the trial itself, when the district
8 attorney attempted to introduce into evidence a
9 comparison of the fingerprints from the roll prints and
10 the fingerprints from the crime scene, at which time the
11

trial court sustained the objection and ordered the

12 Defendant re-fingerprinted.
13

3UESTI0N:

14 one thing.

General Allison, I'm curious about

Didn’t I detect something in the record

15 about a request on his part during this period for an
16 attorney?
17

MR. ALLISON:

18 on this point.
19 both stated,

There is a conflict of testimony

The two police officers that testified

no, he did not ask for an attorney.

20 Detective Hicks very clearly testified on two occasions,
21 no, he never requested an attorney.

So what you have, I

22 think that when the trial judge considered the totality
23 of the circumstances,

he was considering two things when

24 he considered this first motion.

He was considering

25 also a Fifth Amendment question,

the voluntariness of

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that confession

2

And in considering all the facts and

3 circumstances surrounding it, I think that the trial
4 judge had to consider this conflict of testimony between
5 the officer and then the Defendant.

6 a number of things.

The Defendant said

He said, I signed the statement of

7 rights form after I confessed.

But then when he was

8 shown the date on it, he changed the story and said, no,
9 I believe I signed the statement of rights form before I
10 confessed.
11

But I would say that there you have a direct

12 conflict of testimony that had to be resolved by the
13 trial court.

14

The third factor that I would like to look at

15 is the purpose and the flagrancy of the official
16 misconduct of the officers.

I want to compare the

17 conduct of the officers in this case with that in Davis
18 v. Mississippi, Dunaway and Brown.
19

In Davis, the police officers had a latent

20 fingerprint from a crime scene.

The only description

21 the rape victim could give was that it was a young Negro
22 youth.

That was all.

The police go out in a dragnet

23 situation and arrest some 24 people, in a complete
24 absence of probable cause.
25

In Dunaway, the officers maintained that the

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 defendant was simply detained.
2 they maintained.

They did not arrest him,

They merely took, him to the police

3 station for interrogation.

The information in Dunaway

4 came from a person being held in jail.

It passed

5 through several hands.
6

We find a completely different situation when

7 you look, at the fact situation in Taylor.

In Brown,

8 Brown was nothing more than an associate of a murder
9 victim.

He was not even a real suspect.

And yet the

10 officers go to his apartment at 7&30 at night, they
11 search his apartment without a warrant.

They jump out

12 and arrest him, and they arrest him in such a manner
13 that would cause fright and shock and confusion.
14 take him to the police station.

They

He has confessed in

15 less than two hours.
16

In Taylor’s case, the investigation had

17 focused on one individual,

Omar Taylor.

The officers go

18 to Omar Taylor and they say, Omar Taylor, you are under
19 arrest for the robbery of Moseley’s Grocery, and they

20 take him to the police station.
21

I want to look at the probable cause that the

22 officers had.
23
24 parallels.

QUESTION;

Of course there are some

In both Dunaway and this case, it was a man

25 in jail who made the suggestion.

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ALLISONs

2

QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

And in this case Martin himself was

3 ultimately convicted, was he not, or implicated at
4 least, in the robbery?
MR. ALLISONs

5

When Omar Taylor gave his

6 statement, he named Charles Martin as his accomplice.
I think that we can show that in this case

7

8 there is much more probable cause and there’s much that
9 would distinguish this case from Dunaway.

Some 20 days

10 after the robbery of Moseley's Grocery — and this
11 robbery of Moseley’s Grocery had been one of a series of

12 armed robberies in the same neighborhood.
13

20 days after the robbery, Charles Martin was

14 arrested in a robbery in the same neighborhood.

During

15 the week following the arrest of Charles Martin,
16 Detective Mobley began to talk to Martin.

He knew

17 Martin as one of the three suspects in the Moseley’s

18 Grocery robbery.

Charles Martin and Detective Mobley

19 began to have conversations over a period of a whole

20 week .
On numerous occasions Mobley talked to

21

22 Martin.

He impressed upon him the importance of telling

23 the truth if he wanted the information to be known to
24 the

judge.

He emphasizes the adverse consequences that

25 any false information would have.

Detective Mobley

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

said, that over a period of a week, I developed a

2 rapport with this man.

He convinced me that he was

3 telling the truth.

Now, there is a difference in the testimony,

4

5 because on one or two occasions Mobley says, Charles
6

Martin told me he heard.

And I’m sure that over a

7 period of talking to this man for at least a week,
8 sure that on occasion he said, I heard,

9 occasions he said,

but on other

I know.

And the district attorney attempted to clarify

10
11

I'm

this point.

On page 15 of the record, which is not in

12 the joint appendix — part of page 15 is — but on page
13 15, on redirect examination the district attorney
14 attempts to clarify this point.

He asks the direct

15 question:
16

"Now, when Martin gave you this information,

17 was it in the sense that Omar Taylor did the robbery or
18 X told me that Omar Taylor did the robbery?"
19
20

21

And his answer was:

"It was in the sense that

Omar Taylor was involved."
He repeatedly told him that he knew that he

22 was involved.

On the following page he states;

"He

23 didn't say anything else other than the fact that he
24 knew that Omar Taylor was involved in the robbery."
25

I think that an experienced police officer,

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 knowing that Charles Martin was a suspect in the very
2 same robbery, I think that an experienced police officer
3 would know that this man could not tell him how he knew
4 without confessing, without saying, I was there standing
5 beside him and robbing Mr. Moseley.
6

The officer knew that he could not tell all

7 the circumstances or the basis of his information, but I
8 think the fact that this man was known as one of the
9 three suspects gave weight to this officer's information

10 and his belief —
11

2UESTI0N:

What did Martin get as a result of

12 this?
13

MR. ALLISON;

The record does not show what

14 the police officer told him.

He said, if you give me

15 reliable information I will see that any help you have
16 given us will be presented to the trial judge for
17 whatever benefit he can give you.

He could not promise

18 him anything, but he could only tell him that the judge

19 would be made aware of it.
20

QUESTION;

Well, what did he end up with?

21

MR. ALLISON;

I have no idea, Your Honor.

The

22 record shows nothing about Charles Martin and his
23 sentence in his case.
24

I think that —

25

QUESTION;

Mr. Allison, I take it from your

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 argument you’re not going to press upon us the necessity
2 to apply some good faith exception to the exclusionary
3 rule or any modification of it?
4

MR. ALLISON;

What I would ask Your Honor is

5 that — I think I’m going to look a little bit further
6 in the probable cause area, but I think what you will
7 find is that if the officers were technically short of
8 probable cause, that they acted in good faith; that
9 whether they acted in good faith could not be a
10 subjective matter with the officers.
11

You would have to

look at it in an objective manner.

12

But if there is an objective, reasonable basis

13 for that belief, then you find this evidence admissible
14 under a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule as
15 set forth in the Fifth Circuit case of United States v.
16 Williams.
QUESTION;

17

Was there any finding by the courts

18 below specifically of the good faith of the officers?
MR. ALLISON;

19

Your Honor, the language of the

20 Alabama Supreme Court when they discussed the
21 exclusionary rule,

it is very difficult to determine

22 exactly what they had in mind.
23 and

It is a detailed history

discussion of the exclusionary rule.

24 Honor,

I cannot answer that question.

But Your

Your

25 interpretation of the second half of the opinion is open

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to interpretation, I would think, Your Honor.
2

QUESTION;

But you can’t point to any specific

3 finding in the courts below on the good faith?
4

NR. ALLISON;

Your Honor, there was none.

5

But to conclude in the area of probable cause,

6 I don’t think that in the suppression hearing the extent
7 of probable cause was ever brought -- or was fully
8 developed.

The officers had — also had a description,

9 not like Davis v. Mississippi, but of a colored male,
10 five foot six inches, 150 pounds, 20 to 25 years old.
11 The record doesn’t even show —
12

QUESTION;

Did they know what the Petitioner

13 looked like before they went out and picked him up?
14

HR. ALLISON;

15 I was going to say.

Your Honor,

that’s exactly what

The record is completely silent.

16 This was never developed.
17

QUESTION:

So that we can’t assume that they

18 relied on the description, then?

The record suggested

19 to me they relied entirely on Officer Mobley’s

20 conversation with this man, with Martin.
21

MR. ALLISON;

I think that the — I think that

22 that is an accurate interpretation.
23
24 himself,

QUESTION;

In fact, he didn’t arrest him

if I understand.

25 go out and pick

He got two other officers to

him up, didn’t he?

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. ALLISON;

1

He relayed the information to a

2 detective, I believe it was Detective Alford,

I believe,

3 who actually made the arrest.

QUESTION;

4

In that relay did he tell him what

5 the Respondent looked like — what the Petitioner

looked

6 like?

MR. ALLISON:

7

The record is silent.

It

8 doesn't go into that.

And if you'd like me to, I would make my

9

10 remarks about the exclusionary rule.
11

If you don't want

to hear those, then —
QUESTION:

13 brief,

They're covered quite fully in your

I think, aren't they?

14

MR. ALLISON:

15 if I might add, that in
16 balancing process in

With the exception of one thing,
the past this Court has used a

making a determination as to

17 whether or not to apply the

exclusionary rule.

In a

18 number of cases this Court has stated exactly what
19 factors were balanced.

20

In U.S. v. Calandra this Court weighed the

21 potential injury to the functions of a grand jury on

the

22 one hand and the effect the suppression of evidence
23 would have as to a deterrence of police misconduct on
24 the other,

and this Court found that illegally seized

25 evidence could

be admitted as an exception to the

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 exclusionary rule.
2

In Waldor v. United States, this Court weighed

3 the need to

prevent perjury and the public interest in

4 determining

the truth on the one hand, and the interest

5 safeguarded

by the exclusionary rule on the other, and

6 this Court that illegally seized evidence could be used
7 for

impeachment purposes.

8

In Michigan v. Tucker, this Court weighed

9 society’s interest

in the effective prosecution of

10 criminals on the one hand and the need to provide an
11 effective sanction to a constitutional right on the
12 other.

MR. ALLISON:

Your Honor, what I would ask the

17 Court to do if they found this evidence otherwise
18 inadmissible is to weigh society's interest in the

19 prevention of crime on the one hand and the benefits
20 derived in applying the exclusionary rule in an
21 objective good faith situation on the other, and
22 consider — I'll name these very briefly — the high
23 cost to society in the release of criminals.

You can

24 see the agony of the Court of Criminal Appeals when they
25 say, we are loath to reverse the conviction of a man so

1 obviously guilty.

Guilt drips from the fingers of both

2 hands, and yet we are lighted by — our path is lighted
3 by Dunaway.
4

Consider the suppresion of the truth in a

5 criminal trial.

Here what could be more reliable than

6 fingerprints?
7

Consider judicial integrity.

Consider the

8 reaction of the public in what they see, where robbers,
9 murderers, rapists are released on what the public calls
10 a technicality.
11 not injured

And consider that judicial integrity is

to the same extent when there is a good

12 faith mistake on the part of officers.
13

And consider proportionality.

Consider the

14 difference between the flagrant violation on the one
15 hand and the good faith action of the police officers on
16 the other.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Do you have anything

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. BENO, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BENO;

21

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

22 the Court;
23

Respondent's statement to you in reference to

24 the facts in this case certainly finds no support in
25 record.

the

He indicates that Charles Martin was a suspect

38

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in the crime.

There is no factual evidence from the

2 record to indicate on what basis he finds that
3 conclusion.
4

He tries to change the events which occurred

5 at the police station and give you some indication that

6 the continuous questioning and police investigation on
7 this crime took place in a very short period of time.

I

8 think it's clear from the record that the Defendant was
9 arrested at 3«00 o'clock, that from that point until he

10 got to the police station, although there is a conflict
11 in the testimony, that he was at least questioned by the
12 police officer in the car; that he was questioned prior
13 to his fingerprints being taken; that he was placed in a
14 lineup prior to a warrant being issued; that he was
15 again questioned.
16

And it's clear on the record that a Detective

17 Wilson -- and this was without rebuttal by the State —
18 that a Detective Wilson threatened to shove his head

19 through the wall if he did confess.
20

2UESTI0N;

Well, you don't — I didn't think

21 you were making any claim that the confession was
22 coerced; are you?

You're just saying it’s a product of

23 an illegal arrest.
24

MR. BENOs

I understand, but I think it's

25 clear that --

1

QUESTIONi

Well, you've never raised the

2 made a coerced confession claim in this case.
3

MR. BENO;

But I'm pointing out, we're now

4 looking at the flagrancy of the police conduct.

Now,

5 that’s certainly a consideration of Dunaway.
6

QUESTIONi

That's quite different from

8

MR. BENOi

Yes, that's correct.

9

QUESTION;

That's what he's suggesting.

10

MR. BENOi

But we're talking about the

7 coercion.

11 flagrancy of the police conduct and the purposefulness

12 from which the arrest was made.

It seemed almost

13 impossible in my mind that Respondent can argue a good
14 faith action on the part of the police.
15

QUESTION;

Well, you wouldn't — if there were

16 probable cause to arrest and the arrest had been legal,
17 you don't suggest that any of this evidence would then
18 be inadmissible, do you?

If there had been probable

19 cause?

20

NR. BENO;

If there's no illegal arrest, we

21 have no grounds for being up here.

22

QUESTION;

Yes, yes.

23 the police officers mistakenly

Exactly, exactly.

So if

thought there was

24 probable cause but there wasn't,

they just proceeded as

25 though there was.

MR. BENOj

That's correct

That's how they

QUESTIONS

4 outrageous?

What makes you think that's so

I mean, they may be wrong.

5

MR. BENOs

I understand.

6

QUESTION;

And under the law it may be that

7 the evidence is inadmissible.

What makes their conduct

8 so outrageous?
9

MR. BENOs

10 of them for

They had this information in front

a period of over a week, Your Honor, over a

11 week to make a determination as to whether or not there
12 was probable cause to make this arrest.
13

QUESTIONS

I suppose this wasn't the only case

14 on the police blotter,
15

MR. BENOs

was it?

I understand that, Your Honor.

16 certainly you’re not going

But

to — it's not going to be

17 contended that because of the number of cases on the
18 police blotter that a police group can go out, even when

19 there is time, in fact time to go to a magistrate or at
20 least contact a district attorney or something of that
21 nature to determine whether or not, based on the bald
22 statement of an alleged rapist and robber, that you can
23 go out and make an arrest.

I don’t think this Court is

24 going to come to that conclusion.
25

If this was a case where after the information

2 and

in good faith made an arrest, that might have been a

3 situation where it was simply a

mistake.

4 case where there is simply a mistake.

This is not a

This is a case

5 where the police obviously knew that they did not have
6

probable cause, that they had time to make a

7 determination — have a determination made as to whether
8 or not there was probable cause,

that the only purpose

9 that the Defendant was picked up in this case was in
10 order to find out whether or not they could,

through

11 their flagrant and purposeful measures, whether or not
12 they could bring in

certain evidence during the

13 detentionary period on
14

which to hold the Defendant.

That is certainly the only fact before you in

15 this case.

If this Court is of the opinion that the

16 police can purposefully and when knowing they have no
17 probable cause go out and pick up an individual in order
18 to determine through investigation of that defendant's
19 condition at the police station whether or not they have
20 a case against the defendant, then we're in a situation
21 where the exclusionary rule no

longer serves a deterrent

22 purpose.
