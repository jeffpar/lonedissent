ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We will hear arguments

HR. SCHULDER*

Thank you.

Hr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, on April 17th,

1980, this

10

Court held in Payton versus New York that absent exigent

11

circumstances or consent, the Fourth Amendment requires

12

law enforcement officers to obtain an arrest warrant

13

before entering a suspect's home to arrest him on

14

probable cause.

15

1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth

16

Circuit had reached a similar conclusion in United

17

States versus Prescott, holding that a warrantless entry

18

into private premises to arrest a suspect violated the

19

Fourth Amendment.

20

Prior to Payton, on September 14th,

The question in this case is whether the

21

Fourth Amendment rule announced in Payton and Prescott

22

should be applied retroactively to suppress evidence

23

obtained as a result of the warrantless arrest entries

24

occurring before the dates of those decisions.

25

The facts of this case are as follows.

containing a United States Treasury check to a woman

named Lena Kearney.

keep the check and try to cash it.

5

Respondent and two other men met at Kearney’s house to

6

discuss possible ways of cashing the check.

7

making a telephone call, Respondent announced that he

believed he had found someone who could help them cash

9

the check.

Kearney and a friend decided to

Respondent and the other men then left

11

Kearney's house with the check in their possession.

12

Some time later, a Secret Service agent investigating

13

this matter learned from Kearney and her friend about

14

Respondent's involvement in the scheme to cash the check.

15

On May 5th,

1977, two federal agents went to

16

Respondent's house to question him about his involvement

17

in the scheme.

Respondent's arrest, the agents did not obtain an arrest

19

warrant for Respondent before proceeding to his house.

20

The agents approached the door and knocked on it, and

21

when Respondent opened the door, the agents identified

22

themselves, and Respondent invited them inside.

23

Although they had probable cause for

Once inside the house, the agents gave

24

Respondent his Miranda warnings, and Respondent revealed

25

his role in the scheme to cash the check.

The agents

2

brought him to the police station, where he signed a

3

written confession.

and abetting the obstruction of correspondence.

to trial, he moved to suppress his statements on the

6

ground that they were the fruits of an unlawful arrest

after a jury trial.

Respondent was charged with aiding
Prior

The district

On appeal, the court of appeals, in December

10

11

of 1978, initially affirmed Respondent’s conviction.

12

The court concluded that even though the agents were not

13

armed with a warrant when they entered Respondent’s

14

house to arrest him, the agents' actions did not violate

15

the Fourth Amendment, because they had probable cause to

16

arrest Respondent prior to their entry.
Relying on the Ninth Circuit's decision in

17
18

United States versus Prescott, Respondent petitioned for

19

rehearing, arguing for the first time that the

20

warrantless entry into his house violated the Fourth

21

Amendment.

22

distinguishing this case from Prescott and holding that

23

the agents' actions were permissible under the Fourth

24

Amendment.

25

The panel issued an amended opinion

Following this Court's decision in Payton
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

versus New York, the court of appeals issued a third

2

decision, this time reversing Respondent’s conviction,

3

relying on Payton,

4

retroactivity principles.

5

warrantless entry into the Respondent’s house violated

6

the Fourth Amendment, and that Respondent’s statements

7

should have been suppressed as the fruits of that

8

illegality.

but without any discussion of
The court held that the

9

The government then petitioned for rehearing,

10

arguing that the rule announced in Payton should not be

11

applied retroactively.

12

that the government had to address the retroactivity

13

question before the court of appeals.

14

the government's arguments, the court of appeals revised

15

its opinion to explain that its suppression ruling was

16

based both on Payton and on its earlier decision in

17

Prescott.

18

This was the first opportunity

In response to

Although the arrest entry in this case

19

occurred prior to either of those decisions, the court

20

noted that it held in another case that Prescott would

21

be given retroactive effect in this circuit to arrest

22

entries that occurred prior to Prescott.

23

the court applied the warrant requirement established in

24

Payton and Prescott to the arrest entry in this case.

25

Accordingly,

It is our position that the ruling of the
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court of appeals is inconsistent with established

2

principles governing the retroactivity of decisions that

3

expand the scope of Fourth Amendment protections.

4

United States versus Peltier, this Court observed that

5

in every case in which it considered the retroactivity

6

of a decision announcing a new Fourth Amendment

7

standard, the Court had concluded that the new standard

8

would be applied prospectively only.

9

In

The Court 's consistent refusal to give

10

retroactive effect to these Fourth Amendment decisions

11

stems from its reluctance to apply the exclusionary rule

12

to suppress the fruits of law enforcement conduct that

13

took place before the new standards were announced.

14

As the Court has stated on many occasions, the

15

exclusionary rule is a judge-made rule primarily

16

designed to deter law enforcement officers from

17

violating the Fourth Amendment.

18

personal right of the party aggrieved by the search or

19

seizure, but rather it is intended to protect Fourth

20

Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect .

21

The rule is not a

In addition, the application of the

22

exclusionary rule, as the Court has noted many times,

23

imposes heavy costs on society, by withholding relevant,

24

probative evidence, with the result that the

25

truthfinding function of the criminal trial is

1

impaired.

2

the exclusionary rule in a variety of different settings

3

where the social costs were deemed to outweigh the

4

deterrent benefits.

5

Accordingly, the Court has refused to apply

For example, the Court has held the

6

exclusionary rule does not apply to suppress evidence in

7

grand jury proceedings, that evidence seized illegally

8

by state police is not subject to suppression in federal

9

civil proceedings, and that illegally seized evidence,

10

while inadmissible on the government's case in chief,

11

may be used to impeach a defendant's testimony in a

12

criminal trial.

13

The retroactivity cases present yet another

14

setting in which the Court has concluded that the costs

15

to society of suppressing reliable evidence outweigh the

16

benefits of exclusion.

17

Peltier, neither the deterrent purpose of the

18

exclusionary rule nor the imperative of judicial

19

integrity are served by suppressing evidence obtained by

20

law enforcement officers in good faith compliance with

21

then prevailing constitutional norms.

22

As the Court made clear in

Thus, once a new Fourth Amendment standard is

23

announced, the police will be guided by that standard,

24

and if the premise behind the exclusionary rule is

25

sound, they will be deterred from violating the new
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

standard by the threat of suppression.

However, there

2

is little or nothing to be gained by imposing the

3

exclusionary sanction to police conduct that occurred

4

before the new standard was established, since the

5

police could not have known that their conduct

6

transgressed constitutional limits.
Respondent does not appear to take issue with

7

8

any of these general principles.

His main argument here

9

is that Payton and Prescott should not be applied

10

retroactively because in Respondent's view those

11

decisions did not establish a new Fourth Amendment

12

rule.

13

principles, the retroactivity of that decision is a moot

14

question, since any subsequent case would be governed by

15

the same pre-existing principles.

16

where a decision in the Fourth Amendment area overrules

17

past precedent, even Respondent would agree that such a

18

decision should not be applied retroactively.

19

Of course, if a decision is based on existing

On the other hand,

The focus of the dispute in this case is

20

whether decisions resolving previously unsettled Fourth

21

Amendment questions are new, and thus under the test in

22

Peltier are not to be applied retroactively.

23

There is no doubt, and Respondent concedes

24

that the constitutionality of warrantless arrest entries

25

was an open question in the Ninth Circuit prior to

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Prescott, and in this Court prior to Payton.

Indeed, in

2

Payton the Court pointed out that the practice of making

3

warrantless arrest entries was long-standing and

4

widespread, and that most of the states that had taken a

5

position on the question had approved the practice.

6

Moreover, most of the state and federal court decisions

7

cited in Payton as disapproving the practice of making

8

warrantless arrest entries were issued after the entry

9

into Respondent's house in May, 1977.

10

For many years, therefore, this Court was

11

aware that warrantless arrest entries were standard

12

police practice, yet it did not declare that practice to

13

be unlawful until its decision in Payton.
In light of this background, we submit that

14
15

Payton -- that before Payton was decided, law

16

enforcement agencies throughout the country were

17

justified in believing that warrantless arrest entries

18

were constitutionally acceptable unless controlling

19

lower courts within a particular jurisdiction had

20

already held that such conduct was prohibited.

We

would submit that the controlling federal court within a

particular circuit would be the court of appeals for

that circuit.

QUESTIONi

10

So that if there simply were a

11

conflict in district court decisions, there would be no

12

question of retroactivity one way or the other?

13

MR. SCHULDER;

14

QUESTION;

That's correct.

Why pick out the court of appeals

15

as opposed to the district court?

16

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, because the decision of

17

one district judge is not binding on any other judge

18

within a particular district, whereas the decision of

19

the court of appeals is controlling within — within the

20

circuit.
QUESTION;

21
22
23

What if he is the only judge in the

district?
MR. SCHULDER;

Well, if he is the only judge

24

in -- well, presumably the government will have an

25

opportunity to test the correctness of his decision on

11

appeal to the court of appeals.
QUESTION:

2

And assume he is affirmed.

Then

3

when did the law first become binding on the officers in

4

that district?

5

of his first ruling?

6

ignore the district judge's ruling in that district even

7

though it is later affirmed on appeal?

10

Can the law -- Can the FBI just

The date of the affirmance, or the date

I would think that in that

limited situation, they might be doing so to their own
detriment.
QUESTION:

11

Well, a court of appeals opinion

12

can always be — you can always petition for certiorari

13

here from that opinion.

14

MR. SCHULDER:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So why does the court of appeals

16

opinion become a milestone if a district court opinion

17

doesn *t ?

18

QUESTION:

The only possible difference, I

19

suggest, counsel, is that review here is in virtually

20

every instance a matter of discretion by this Court,

21

where a review by the court of appeals is mandatory, and

22

I am not suggesting that is a significant difference.

23

MR. SCHULDER;

24

QUESTION;

25

That's correct.

Otherwise, is there any difference

in the posture of the two cases?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Well, a decision of a district

2

court would not be considered stare decisis in the same

3

way that a court of appeals decision would be.
QUESTION;

I believe you said it is not

binding even on his fellow district judges.

6

MR. SCHULDER;

That’s correct.

Whereas a court of appeals opinion

is binding on everyone in the circuit.
MR. SCHULDER;

That’s correct.

11

within the particular circuit.
QUESTION;

12
13

though, do they?
MR. SCHULDER;

14
15

Perhaps not in certain cases,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

16
17

They don’t uniformly observe that,

That is what we call intra-circuit

conflicts.

18

MR. SCHULDER;

19

QUESTION;

That's correct.

There are some districts in which

20

the judges more or less informally adopt a sort of a

21

stare decisis practice of their own, treating similar

22

problems in the same way, to have uniform law within the

23

district.

24

here, would that make a difference, or would you still

25

just ignore the district judge?

If they had such a rule within the district

We believe that the agents

to decisions of the district court.

You would say this case would be

decided differently if the Ninth Circuit were not so far

behind in its backlog of cases, and this had gotten here

in a number of cases, Stovall, Desist, and others, that

QUESTION;

Peltier had gotten here before Almeida-Sanchez, Peltier
might have been the deciding case.
ME. SCHULDER:

That's correct, and it's true

12

of a number of other decisions where the Court has

13

concluded that we look at the actual time at which the

14

search or seizure or other law enforcement practice

15

that's involved took place, rather that at any -- at any

16

other point, because it is the time at which the law

17

enforcement officers actually acted, at which they are

18

charged with knowing or not knowing what the law was at

19

a given — at a given point in time.

20

Furthermore, the whole purpose underlying the

21

exclusionary rule is the deterrent purpose, and if the

22

agents at a given time have no way of knowing that their

23

action is unlawful, no deterrent purpose or no

24

significant deterrent purpose would be served by

25

suppressing evidence as a result of search and seizure
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that was later leclared to be unlawful, especially since

2

now that Payton and Prescott have been decided.

3

is a clear rule that law enforcement officers know they

4

have to follow.

5

There

Respondent argues in this case that the

6

decisions in Payton and Prescott were clearly

7

foreshadowed by dicta in the decisions of this Court and

8

the Ninth Circuit, and by the Court's so-called

9

persistent avoidance of this issue, which in

10

Respondent's view should have signalled to law

11

enforcement agencies that the issue would eventually be

12

decided adversely to the government.

13

out in our briefs, we do not believe that the decisions

14

in Payton and Prescott were clearly foreshadowed.

15

As we have pointed

In any case. Respondent's test is the wrong

16

one for deciding whether to apply the exclusionary rule

17

to suppress evidence acquired during a search or seizure

18

that occurred prior to the decision that established the

19

practice in question to be unconstitutional.

20

To paraphrase Judge Wilkie's dissent in United

21

States versus Ross in the District of Columbia court of

22

appeals, the proper inquiry is not whether lawyers and

23

judges would describe a new Fourth Amendment decision as

24

having been clearly foreshadowed, but whether law

25

enforcement agencies can properly be charged with having
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

had notice at the time of the search or seizure that the

2

practice violated the Fourth Amendment.

3

In this very case, the court of appeals judges

4

who initially affirmed Respondent's conviction in

5

December, 1978, and upheld the warrantless entry into

6

his house, apparently did not believe that the Fourth

7

Amendment required a warrant.

8

himself did not challenge the warrantless entry until

9

after Prescott announced such a requirement.

10

In fact, Respondent

In these circumstances, it would be peculiar,

11

we suggest,

12

have known of the need for a warrant some 16 months

13

before Prescott announced that requirement and some

14

three years before the Court in Payton announced the

15

requirement.

16

to conclude that the arresting agents should

In our view, Petitioner's argument here

17

ignores the social costs of imposing the exclusionary

18

rule in this context.

19

the -- is that the search for truth at criminal trials

20

is impaired by the exclusion of reliable evidence, with

21

the result that guilty defendants may go free.

22

Payton and Prescott have established a clear rule for

23

law enforcement officers, there is no reason for the

24

Court to suppress evidence to accomplish that deterrent

25

effect, because the agents now know that any searches,

The primary cost, of course, is

Now that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

any arrest entries that they conduct in the absence of

2

exigent circumstances in the future may result in the

3

suppression of evidence.
In a more general way, it is arguable that the

4
5

retroactive application of decisions like Payton,

which

6

involve previously unsettled questions, may deter law

7

enforcement officers from engaging in conduct that is

8

not yet settled as being lawful.

12

an issue is unsettled, officers must conform their

13

conduct to suggestions in dicta made from the bench by

14

district judges, then the effectiveness of law

15

enforcement officers will be measurably diminished.

In fact, if, as Respondent argues, whenever

HR. SCHULDER:

I agree with you. Your Honor.

8

Whatever incremental deterrent benefit, that

9

is, the deterrence of some unlawful conduct that might

10

arise from suppression in this context hardly justifies

11

the costs of such a policy, especially since the period

12

of uncertainty as to any particular law enforcement

13

practice will last only until that practice is

14

challenged in court and its validity is judicially

15

determined.

16

Of course, as I said earlier, once the courts

17

hold that a particular practice is unconstitutional,

18

then under our system of government, society must be

19

willing to pay the price of both exclusion of evidence

20

and -- and of reduced law enforcement.

21

Court's decision in Payton, the Court noted that the

required the police to obtain a warrant, whatever costs

Those costs had to give

cases.

Why was it appropriate to decide them both?

6

shouldn't we have picked one and let the other one --

7

what justification was there for reversing both

con victions?
MR. SCHULDER:

9

Why

Well, the Court granted

10

certiorari in both cases, and heard arguments in both

11

cases.

12

QUESTION:

But really, it is kind of unfair to

13

the officers in the later of the two searches, I

14

suppose, and there were a bunch of cases that we held

15

for decision in those.

16

that, either.

17

MR. SCHULDER:

I suppose we shouldn't have done

Well, we don't feel that —

18

apparently the Court has developed a practice of holding

19

cases pending its decision in cases that it has

20

accepted, but there is no requirement that the Court do

21

so, and there is --

22

QUESTION:

But at the time a Fourth Amendment

23

issue comes to us for the first time with several cases,

24

I would suppose the government's view is that we should

25

decide just one of them, because there is really no

2

MR. SCHULDER;

That's correct.

3

Finally, Respondent argues that he should

4

benefit from the rule announced in Payton and Prescott

5

because his case was on direct review at the time those

6

decisions were announced.

earlier, because the exclusionary rule is not a personal

violations,

It is our position that because the Court has

said in numerous cases that the exclusionary rule should

be limited and applied only in order to -- only in those

cases where its application serves a deterrent benefit,

8

that it simply should not be applied even to cases on

direct review after the Court has announced a new Fourth

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. WALTER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. WALTER*

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

2

please the Court, I agree basically with the recitation

3

of the procedural history of this case made by

4

government counsel, except in one major respect, and

5

that is, as the Court is aware, this case has had a

6

sored -- not a sored, but a troubled path through the

7

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The first opinion of the Ninth Circuit Court

8
9

of Appeals did something which I think is very important

10

in this Court's analysis of the issue that is present

11

before the Court, and that is, it made a de novo finding

12

that there was probable cause for the arrest of my

13

client.

14

the motion to suppress and also during the — during the

15

course of the trial, and the trial judge so found, that

16

there was no probable cause for my client's arrest on

17

the day that Agents Hemingway and Pickering went to the

18

home to interrogate him.

19

The -- It was clear in the trial court during

The lack of probable cause was a determination

20

made by the trial court based upon the testimony

21

elicited, I believe, from -- it was Agent Pickering.

22

Agent Pickering testified that it was his belief that at

23

the time that they went to my client's home, that they

24

did not have sufficient evidence to arrest my client.

25

According to Agent Pickering, or Hemingway -- I can't
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

recall which agent -- the purpose of going to my

2

client’s home was to question him with respect to his

3

involvement regarding this Treasury check.
However, it was further developed at the

4
5

motion to suppress that the agents intended to arrest my

6

client depending upon the degree of my client's

7

statements at the time of the interview at his home.
That was a direct finding by the trial court.

8
9

In the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit took the

10

position that it was appropriate for them to undertake a

11

de novo review and as a result of that de novo review,

12

determined that there was probable cause for the

13

arrest.

14

relied on facts that were developed during the course of

15

the trial relating to a conversation that took place

16

between my client on the telephone and supposedly the

17

person who was trying to cash the check.

What the Ninth Circuit failed to do is, they

of probable cause.

Well, I am attacking the finding

I am not attacking the analysis of

10

the Ninth Circuit with respect to the retroactivity

11

question, but I think the fact that the agents didn't

12

have probable cause when they went to the home is

13

important in the Peltier test of the agents' knowledge

14

in connection with whether or not the principles of

15

Payton and Prescott should be applied retroactively in

16

this case.

17

QUESTION*

But if the case comes to us, it

18

comes with a finding by the Court we are reviewing that

19

there was probable cause.

20

MR. WALTER*

That's correct. Your Honor, but I

21

think it is -- the Ninth Circuit's finding is erroneous,

22

because it is not supportable by the record .

23

trial court’s finding based upon the motion to suppress

24

that there was no probable cause.

25

It was the

appeals' finding at any time in the court of appeals?
MR. WALTER;

2

In all candor, Your Honor, I

3

can’t — I believe that I -- in one of the petitions for

4

rehearing, I pointed out to the Ninth Circuit that their

5

analysis of the probable cause issue was incorrect,

6

because they were relying on facts developed during the

7

trial and not facts developed in the motion to suppress.
QUESTION;

8

At what stage was that in the court

of appeals?
MR. WALTER;

10

That was on -- I believe it was

11

the first petition for rehearing when I requested the

12

court to consider the case in light of Prescott.

opportunity to object to that, and there was no

2

objection by the -- by the government.

3

QUESTION;

But the court of appeals has never

4

directly addressed itself to your argument that there

5

was no probable cause?

6

MR. WALTER;

No, it has not.

But I think it

7

is important, Your Honors, in terms of analyzing the

8

particular conduct of these law enforcement agents,

9

these are not local law enforcement agents, these are

10

highly trained Secret Service agents.

If I understand

11

the test in Peltier, and I am not -- I am not quite sure

12

that I do -- I don't think many circuits understand the

13

test in Peltier -- it has to do with the knowledge that

14

is chargeable to the agents or properly chargeable to

15

the agents or the actual knowledge of the agents.

16

I am not clear which of those approaches is

17

really meant to be adopted by this Court, and I think

18

that is one of the problems in this case, where the

19

government relies on Judge Wilkie's dissent in Ross, and

20

indicating that it is not for judges or lawyers to make

21

a determination as to whether or not there is a

22

principle that is clearly foreshadowed, or a decision

23

that clearly foreshadows a principle, but whether or not

24

the law enforcement officers had knowledge.

25

If that is the test for — in connection with
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

the retroactivity, it seems to me that it opens a whole

area of additional questions or inquiry in a motion to

suppress.

4

searching officer at the time that he conducts the

5

search, which is the knowledge requirement that is

6

required by Peltier, then it seems to me defense counsel

7

as well as the government is going to want to put on

8

evidence as to the specific training, understanding, or

9

knowledge of that particular officer.

issue is there before us other than the retroactivity?

12
13

If it is the subjective intent of the

Well, what is all of this you have

MR. WALTER:

Well, I think in terms of

17

analyzing the retroactivity question, Your Honor, if we

18

assume that Peltier applies in this case, we have to

19

determine what the standards of Peltier are in terms of

20

assessing the actual knowledge of the law enforcement

21

officers or the knowledge that may be properly

22

chargeable.

23

QUESTION:

You just assume that it applies.

24

MR. WALTER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, and if it does —
Well, that is the whole point it is
28

here.

Once you assume that, the case is over.

2

MR. WALTER;

3

QUESTION;

4

If we assume that it is

retroactive, don't you automatically win?

5

MR. WALTER;

6

QUESTION;

7
8

9

No, Your Honor, I don't --

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, why would we grant cert to

assume that?
MR. WALTER;

Your Honor, I believe that the

analysis, the retroactivity question begins with an

10

analysis of what knowledge is probably chargeable to the

11

law enforcement officers at the time of the conduct in

12

question, and in order to make that analysis, the

13

government argues that the issue in this case is not

14

whether this — Payton or Prescott overruled any cases,

15

but that it established or resolved a previously

16

unsettled constitutional principle.

17

And the question that we have presented here

18

is, what knowledge with respect to that new

19

constitutional principle should have been chargeable to

20

the law enforcement officer at the time that they went

21

to my client's home in May of 1977, and I submit that if

22

we accept the — in analyzing the -- I believe it is

23

appropriate to analyze the state of the law at the time

24

of the conduct in question in the particular circuit,

25

which happens to be the Ninth Circuit in Prescott, to

make a determination as to whether or not Prescott was

2

clearly foreshadowed and therefore whether or not the

3

law enforcement officers should have been properly

4

charged with the knowledge that there was going to be a

5

warrant requirement.
I think we have to also keep in mind that this

6
7

particular case doesn't deal with a practice that had

8

continuing administrative approval such as that in

9

Almeida-Sanchez, or had received continuous judicial

10

approval.

11

specific judicial approval.

12

which permitted law enforcement officers to go into

13

someone's home absent exigent circumstances for

14

arresting, for purposes of an arrest.

15

This was a practice which had never received
There were no regulations

This was a area that had been continuously and

constantly expressly reserved by opinions of this Court

and also opinions of the Ninth Circuit.

contain merely dicta.

important that the case in 19 — I believe it was 1976,

of the Ninth Circuit panel in that case that in that

particular case, that if the court -- that an arrest

12

particular defendant in that case, because the arrest

13

took place in his home.

And I think it is also

In that case, the

14

I think that the device —

15

QUESTION*

Mr. Walter, doesn’t -- doesn’t the

16

opinion in Payton itself outline the division of

17

thinking that existed in this country about the

18

requirement of the warrant, and doesn't it outline quite

19

thoroughly in the majority opinion as well as the

20

dissent why this was not a settled matter at all at the

21

time Payton was decided?

22

MR. WALTER*

Yes, I agree with Your Honor,

23

except I think that the -- I think that is absolutely

24

correct, but then the next step is whether or not the

25

law enforcement officers should have known or could have
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

was going to be required.

3

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that it is

4

appropriate policy for us to charge the average peace

5

officer with the requirement of anticipating the rulings

of this Court in matters of this kind that are unsettled?

MR. WALTER:

Not the average peace officer,

Your Honor, but here we are dealing with not the average

11

QUESTION:

We are dealing with a

And you think that the rules should

differ depending upon the particular training and

background of the particular police officer and how

sophisticated that officer is --

Well —
-- as to whether a particular

MR. WALTER:

20

MR. WALTER:

No, I —
Is that a desirable approach?
I don’t think so. Your Honor,

21

because again, I think that would get into the

22

subjective analysis of the knowledge of the particular

23

law enforcement officer, but I think that you can have a

24

-- the hypothetical law enforcement officer in the

25

particular jurisdiction, and in this case it's the

Secret Service in the Ninth Circuit.

2

Your Honor, in the state of California, we had People

3

versus Ramey, which was a California Supreme Court case,

4

which was decided in 1976, which was not dicta, it was

5

very clear that there was going to be an arrest warrant

6

that was going to be required of law enforcement

7

officers to effect an arrest inside the home absent

8

exigent circumstances.

9

For that matter,

In the Central District, the Secret Service

10

agents work very closely, as do the FBI and other -- the

11

DEA agents work very closely with local law

12

enforcement.

13

question —

14

More importantly, and I think there was a

QUESTION*

How about the, say, the

15

hypothetical court of appeals judge.

16

panel of the court of appeals on December 19th, 1978,

17

that affirms this judgment.

18

that a law enforcement officer should have anticipated

19

the state of the law in the Ninth Circuit in 1978, when

20

three judges of the court of appeals couldn't do it?

21

MR. WALTER;

Here you have a

I mean, is it fair to say

Well, Your Honor, I -- yes, I do,

22

and I -- and I believe so because of the peculiar facts

23

in this case, and that is, Judge Ferguson's decision,

24

admittedly dicta, and it wasn't even a reported

25

decision, in the district court three months prior to my
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

client’s arrest, where he told the government that if

2

you bring a case to me again where there is no arrest

3

warrant, and you arrest someone in the home without

4

exigent circumstances, I am going to suppress the

5

evidence, because it is my belief that People versus

6

Ramey and United States versus Dorman is the law.

12

QUESTION!

How many judges are there on the --

were there in the Central District at that time?
MR. WALTER:
QUESTION!

I would say a dozen, Your Honor.
Do you think they all would have

followed Judge Ferguson's ruling?
MR. WALTER!

No, Your Honor, but I know for a

13

fact that what happened as a result of Judge Ferguson's

14

rule is that there was a memorandum that was generated

15

in the United States Attorney's office which indicated

16

that Judge Ferguson had so held, and that memorandum

17

went out to define precisely what Judge Ferguson's

18

ruling was, and suggested to at that time the chief of

19

the Criminal Division that from now on we had better

20

start having agents obtain arrest warrants if they are

21

going to arrest someone in their home.

22

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting then that it

23

goes all the way down to the district court, and that if

24

one district judge has so ruled, that is what the law is

25

in the district?
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. WALTER;

No, Your Honor.

I am not

2

suggesting it is the law that is in the district, but if

3

as a result of that district court judge's announcement,

4

the government in the form of the United States

5

Attorney’s office takes the position that they are going

6

to institute now a warrant requirement, then I think

7

that it is incumbent upon the United States Attorney's

8

office to disseminate that information to various law

9

enforcement agencies that when you come to us for

10

purposes of seeking a complaint or authority to arrest

11

someone, that we are going to require arrest warrants,

12

and I think that is what happened in this case.

13

This is not the situation, as the government

14

would paint it, that there is a fast-moving series of

15

events by these law enforcement officers who were

16

fearful for their life.

17

Hemingway, they conducted a thorough investigation, and

18

as the result of that investigation they went to the

There is absolutely no reason to believe that

2

there was any difference between Oscar Dodd and my

3

client, Raymond Johnson, with respect to obtaining a

4

warrant, and I think -- and I was precluded from

5

exploring this at the trial court level, and I think the

6

reason for that was is that the Assistant United States

7

Attorney informed the Secret Service agents that there

8

wasn't sufficient probable cause and that they had

9

better go out and interview Mr. Johnson, and hopefully

10

obtain some admissions from Mr. Johnson, so that then

11

they could come back and they would have sufficient

12

probable cause for an arrest warrant.

13

QUESTION*

Mr. Walker -- oh, excuse me.

14

QUESTION:

As a matter of administration of

15

the U.S. Attorney’s office, as a practical matter, since

16

they know they might come with their cases before the

17

same judge, just as a practical matter, wouldn’t they

18

try to be prepared to meet that judge’s standards even

19

if they didn’t agree with them?

20

MR. WALTER*

21

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor, except that -Why should that be binding on

22

anybody else?

23

that has any significance in the whole scheme of things.

24
25

I am not quite sure why you suggest that

MR. WALTER*

Well, again, I think it is

significant in terms of the — of the knowledge properly

submit that if --

The government argues

Law enforcement officers must have notice of

I contend that based upon the -- what

QUESTION:

They had notice that that

particular judge would react that particular way.
MR. WALTER:

That's correct.

The problem is

13

is that you don't know which judge the case is going to

be assigned to, so --

QUESTION:

That's right.

So it is something

16

like the converse of the strength is the strength of the

weakest link.

MR. WALTER:

Well, Judge Ferguson -- although

19

Judge Ferguson was the only one that I could find that

20

articulated those views, I know that he had several -- I

21

know he still does, has several of his fellow judges who

22

-- at least two or three or four that come to mind, that

23

had a great deal of respect for Judge Ferguson, and

probably in a si milar situation would have gone -- would

Mr. Walter, I think it is way over

QUESTION

2

MR. WALTER4

And no other case
-- and I believe that this Court

3

can affirm the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judgment

4

on the limited basis that Prescott applied retroactively

5

in this case, the Johnson case, and it is not necessary

6

to decide whether or not Payton applies retroactively,

7

because that was clearly the law of the Ninth Circuit,

8

at least in my view, at the time.

9

In conclusion. Your Honors, the government's

10

position in terms of marginal deterrence and not

11

resolving Fourth Amendment issues in favor of obtaining

12

a warrant or its approach in terms of analyzing the

13

state of the law suggest that the law enforcement

can

14

adopt a wait and see attitude or somehow they can

be

15

purposefully ignorant until a Ninth Circuit Court

of

16

Appeals decision or opinion of this Court is handed down

17

which clearly settles a particular question.

18

I think that that is something that should not

19

be condoned by this Court.

I think that the law

20

enforcement officers in the federal system are

21

surrounded by very capable

and competent lawyers, and

22

those lawyers are under an

obligation — As indicated in

23

the government's brief, the Department of Justice, after

24

the Second Circuit decision, issued a policy memorandum

25

advising law enforcement that they should now seek

arrest warrants
I think that the law enforcement agencies,

2
3

because they have access to counsel, should rely on

4

counsel, counsel should be able to interpret the

5

particular decisions and arrive at some form of action

6

which will be consistent with what the law will be.

7

Thank you.

That's correct.

MR. WALTER*

Based upon the circumstances of

what happened at the home, and how they entered, and the

inside the premises, and I truly believe it was a search

search each room in the house, they did not go into

closets or drawers -- also, the manner in which they

have met him as soon as he got out of the car.

record that when one of the agents went into the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

12

MR. SCHULDER:

One or two brief points. Your

13

Honor.

14

that this case is on direct review again, Mr. Justice

15

Stevens.

16

policy, leaving aside Article III considerations, the

17

first litigant to establish the rule in a particular

18

case shouldn't benefit either from the new rule, but as

19

the Court established in Stovall versus Denno, sound

20

policies of decision-making rooted in Article III

21

require the Court to apply the new rule to that

22

particular litigant.

23

I would like to address the question of the fact

As a matter of purely exclusionary rule

So that in effect it was really Payton who got

24

a windfall if we are looking at it simply from the

25

exclusionary rule policy standpoint.
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTIONi

1

Let me test that with you for just

2

a moment.

You recall in his opinion in Desist, Justice

3

Harlan draws a distinction between a court of law and a

4

superlegislature, and if you treat the decisions of this

5

Court as creating new law just out of whole cloth as a

6

superlegislature could, then you can justify that in

7

terms of policies of the exclusionary rule, but

8

supposing in the second argument of the Payton case --

9

it didn't happen this way -- somebody had done some

10

original historical research and found that the Framers

11

of the Fourth Amendment, some unambiguous language that

12

said, we don’t intend to let anybody arrest anybody in

13

his home without a warrant, so that at the time of the

14

decision it was clear that the Court wasn't making some

15

new rule of law like a superlegislature, but was

16

announcing what had always been the law but had not been

17

perceived to be before, and had been the law since the

18

Constitution was first adopted.

19

the same argument?

20

Would you still make

All the other policy things are the same.

The

21

officer didn't know about it at the time he entered the

22

home, and so forth.

MR. SCHULDER»

Well, if no one else knew about

this particular piece of history -QUESTIONi

Right.

1

MR. SCHULDER;

2

it through the years -QUESTION;

3

— and everyone had relied on

But the fact of the matter is that

4

what the Court did is not make law.

It merely

5

discovered what the law had been since the Constitution

6

was adopted.

Would your argument be the same?

7

MR. SCHULDER;

8

Another point I would like to make just very

9
10

Yes, it would.

Yes, it would.

briefly is that there are occasions, as in Payton, where
the Court does take more than one -QUESTION;

11

Are you troubled at all when you

12

make the same argument there, that different litigants

13

whose cases are pending at the same time, only one of

14

them gets the benefit of a rule of law that was part of

15

our constitution ever since it was adopted?

16

bother you at all?
MR. SCHULDER;

17

Does that

It doesn’t bother me in the

18

context of the exclusionary rule, where the social costs

19

of exclusion are so great.

20

address myself to the fact that the Court took both

21

Payton and Riddick's cases up, and it sometimes does

22

that —

23

QUESTION;

I would also like to just

Well, Mr. Schulder, there is a

24

possibly real matter, the District of Columbia code

25

involving civil rights, a whole provision was lost in

2

later, it was found, and this Court said it was the law

all along.

4

talking about.

That is what I think Justice Stevens was
There was no new law.

5

QUESTION*

Going back to --

6

QUESTION*

It was a statute that was lost.

7

QUESTION;

Going back to the hypothetical

8

suggestion, is there any evidence that from

1790 until

9

the Weeks case, that anybody involved in drafting the

10

Constitution or writing the Federalist Papers or

11

anything else ever thought that a court had authority to

12

exclude the evidence of a dead body, the victim of a

13

murder, or pistols, or heroin, or what-not?
MR. SCHULDER*

14

Not that I’m aware of, Your

15

Honor.

In fact, one of the points involved here is that

16

we are talking about the exclusionary remedy here,

17

whether the remedy should be applied, not whether the

18

substantive right was or was not the law, however we may

19

want to define that.

20

The Court will sometimes, as I was about to

21

say in reference to Justice Stevens’ earlier question

22

about why the Court may take two cases or more, there

23

may be certain instances where there are different

24

factual settings in which the Court may want to examine

25

a particular issue.

For example, in Payton's case, I
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I don't

1

believe Payton was not at home and Riddick was

2

suggest that that is the reason the Court took both

3

cases, but there are several -- there are occasions when

4

the Court may want to examine a difficult question by --

5

by looking at different factual settings in which that

6

issue may arise.
QUESTIONi

7

Wouldn't you agree, though, that

8

there are -- maybe you would say it is outweighed by the

9

costs and the interest of law enforcement, but isn't

10

there at least an interest in treating identically

11

situated litigants alike in a court of law?

12

some interest in doing that?

13

two litigants from different parts of the country who

14

have the same problem?

15

happened at the same time in the federal system.

16

there some interest in having them treated alike?

17

MR. SCHULDER:

18

QUESTION;

19

20

Isn't there

Applying the same rule to

Whatever happened to them
Isn't

Well, but --

Some interest, sometimes called

justice?
MR. SCHULDER;

Well, but Article III would

21

require the Court to treat one litigant one way and

22

another litigant --

23

QUESTION;

And the law enforcement policy of

24

no deterrence and all would say, well, we can forget

25

about the other fellow?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

HR. SCHULDER:

That's correct.

2

QUESTION;

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

Hell, on several of the opinions

4

announced this morning, isn't there an indication that

5

for a significant period of time, litigants similarly

6

situated in different circuits were treated differently

7

until we resolved the conflicts with today’s opinions in

8

four or five of the cases decided this morning,

9

announced this morning?

10

MR. SCHULDER:

11

QUESTION:

That’s correct.

I suppose in all those cases in

12

which the judgments are not final, they are subject to

13

re-examination, so they could all be treated alike.

14

After a judgment is final, the problem is a little

15

different.

16

MR. SCHULDER:

Well, I don't believe those

17

cases involve the remedy of exclusion of reliable

18

evidence in a criminal trial, Your Honor.
