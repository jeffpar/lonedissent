ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 80-1436

7
8

AND THE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 80-1781
MR. SCHULDER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

gplease the Court, these two cases present the question
lowhether Congress in the Census Act has prohibited the
11 disclosure to local government officials of address lists
I2prepared by the Census Bureau in the course of conducting
I3the dicennial census.
14

Baldrige versus Shapiro involves a request under

I5the Freedom of Information Act for the Bureau's lists of all
16Street addresses of residential units within Essex County,
17New Jersey.

McNichols versus Baldrige concerns a civil

18discovery request made during a lawsuit challenging the
igcensus results for the Bureau's lists of vacant dwelling
2ounits in Denver, Colorado.
21

We submit that the different factual postures of

22the two cases should not lead to different results.

Our

23view is that the language, structure, history, and purpose
24of the Census Act compell the conclusion that raw census
25data in the hands of the Census Bureau relating to

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 particular census respondents, including the address data at
2 issue here, may not be disclosed.

3

My argument will proceed as follows.

First, I

4 will give a brief description of the enumeration procedures
5 employed in the 1980 census.

Second, I will outline the

6 procedural backgrounds of the two cases.

Third, I will

7explain why the Census Bureau's address lists come within

8the confidentiality mandate of the Census Act.

Finally, I

9 will show that the confidentiality mandate applies

loregardless of whether the information is sought under the
11 FOIA or under civil discovery rules.

12

QUESTION;

Mr. Schulder, will your argument

13 include a discussion of the plain language of the statute?

14

MB. SCHULDER;

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. SCHULDER;

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Perhaps of all the statutes.
The 1980 census, like the two

I7dicennial censuses that preceded it, was conducted primarily
18through the use of the mails.

The Census Bureau mailed out

19 questionnaires for response on or about the census date of
2oApril 1st,

1980.

Beforehand, the Bureau had compiled master

21 address registers for each of some 300,000 enumeration
22districts in the country.

In urban areas an enumeration

23district consists of fewer than 325 street addresses.
24

The master address registers are bound books

25listing separate street addresses for each residential unit,

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

land it includes such information as householders' names, the
2number of units at that address, whether the unit is vacant
3 or occupied, and the number of persons in each unit.
4

The appendix to the amicus brief filed by the MDL

5plaintiffs, the Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs,
6contains a sample copy of the page from -- of a page from
7the address register, and I refer the Court to that
8appendix, if the Court is interested in seeing what one of
9these things actually looks like.
10

The lists of addresses included in the registers

11 were compiled from commercial mailing lists, census postal
I2checks, pre-enumeration canvassing in the field by census
13personnel, and from direct responses to census
14guestionnaires and to interviews conducted by census
15employees during the enumeration process.
16

After most of the guestionnaries were returned,

17the Bureau conducted two follow-up procedures to check the
18status of addresses from which responses had not been

igreceived, and to check units that originally had been listed
2oas vacant.

The enumerators were instructed not to classify

21 a unit as vacant without verifying that fact through
22interviews with either the owner or a neighbor.

23

In addition to these follow-up procedures, the

24Census Bureau gave local government officials an opportunity
25 to review and comment on the Bureau's population and housing

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 tabulations.

As part of this local review program, the

2 Bureau provided aggregate information for each enumeration
3district, including the number of housing units, the number
4 of vacant units, and population figures.
5

In the Shapiro case, Respondent, the executive of

6 Essex County, New Jersey, filed an action under the Freedom
7 of Information Act seeking disclosure of the Census Bureau’s
8address registers for all of the enumeration districts in
9the county.

Respondent Shapiro contended that as part of

lOhis participation in the Bureau’s local review program, he
11 needed the address registers in order to compare the
l2Bureau's address lists with the county’s lists, and thereby
13 to determine whether the Bureau had counted all of the
l4housing units within Essex County.
15

The Bureau claimed that the Census Act bars

I6release of all raw census information relating to particular
I7census respondents, including lists containing addresses of
I8buildings in which individuals reside.

And the Bureau

I9further claimed that this information was therefore exempt
20from disclosure under Exemption 3 of the FOIA.

21

The district court in an oral opinion held that

22the Census Act does not bar disclosure of Census Bureau
23address lists to local government officials seeking to

24 participate in the local review program.

The court ordered

25 the Bureau to disclose its address lists to Respondent

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Shapiro and his agents

The court further ordered that the

2 lists were to be edited as far as possible to delete

3 information other than street addresses.

Finally, the court

4 directed that Respondent's agents be sworn to observe the
5 confidentiality requirements of the Census Act.
6

The third circuit affirmed without opinion.

7

QUESTION:

Wore or less deputizing them as federal

8 employees.

9
10

MR. SCHULDER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In McNichols, after the Census Bureau submitted to

11

Denver officials its working figures for each enumeration

12

district as part of the local review program, Denver

13 challenged the Bureau's vacancy figures, claiming that its
14 own vacancy estimates were much lower.

Denver requested the

15 Bureau to produce address lists of all vacant housing units
16 within the city, so that the city could determine the
17 validity of the Bureau's data.

The Bureau refused to turn

18 over the requested information, contending as it did in the
19 Shapiro case that its address lists of housing units are
20 subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act.
21

Petitioner McNichols, the Mayor of Denver, then

22 filed an action claiming that the Bureau had substantially

23 undercounted Denver's population in reliance on its
24 allegedly arbitrary and unreasonable vacancy figures.
25 Denver requested discovery of the Bureau's updated address

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

registers.

The Bureau again responded that this material

2 was confidential.

The district court, however, ruled that

3 Denver needed the address registers in order to mount a
4 meaningful challenge to the

Bureau's vacancy figures, and

5 did order the Bureau to disclose either the address
6 registers themselves or an

address list of vacant units

7 derived from the registers.

The Bureau was directed to delete the names and

8

9 other information

that might identify census respondents.

QUESTIONi

10

Did that request fix a time frame with

11

respect to the vacancy?

12

MR. SCHULDERi

19 Honor, insofar as the dicennial census is concerned,

1,

1980, which was the date on which everyone was

supposed to have been counted, and as we mentioned in our

22 opening
23

is

brief in Shapiro, or — no, I believe in -QUESTIONi

I am now addressing myself to the

24 request, not to the April

1st date of the Census Bureau.

25 Did the request fix a narrow time frame, or was it addressed

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to April 1st?
2

MR. SCHULDERi

The actual request by the

3 petitioners in McNichols was for a list of the follow-up
4 address registers that had been compiled by the Census
5Bureau.

Those registers/ as far as I am aware/ were

6directed as ascertaining the status of individual housing
7units as of April 1, 1980, the census date.
8

The Tenth Circuit reversed the district court's

9discovery order in McNichols.

The court noted that public

10cooperation with the census depends to a great extent upon
11 the government's promise to keep census information
l2confidential, and it held that both the language and history
13of the Census Act established that Congress intended, and I
l4quote, "both a rigid immunity from publication or discovery
I5and a liberal construction of that immunity that would
I6assure confidentiality."
17

Our argument, in a nutshell, is that the language,

18structure, history, and purpose of the Census Act's
19confidentiality provisions all point to the conclusion that
20the Census Bureau may not reveal raw census data relating to

2lindividual census respondents, including address lists.

We

22have developed these points at length in our briefs, and
23will not repeat them in detail here.

However, I would like

241o highlight some key themes.
25

First, examination of the language and structure

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the Act reveals Congress's purpose to erect a wall of
2 confidentiality for identifiable individual census data.
3 Section 8(b) of the Act provides that the Bureau, or the
4 Secretary of Commerce and his agents, which in this case
5essentially means the Census Bureau, may disclose numerical
6 tabulations and statistical materials, but there is a very
7important limitation placed upon that disclosure.
8

Even numerical tabulations and statistical

9materials may not be disclosed if that disclosure would
10 reveal information reported by or on behalf of any
11 particular census respondent.

This limiting language serves

I2the same essential purpose as the confidentiality provisions
13that are contained in Section 9(a) of the Census Act.
14

Section 9(a)(1) of the Act prohibits the Secretary

15 of Commerce and his agents from using information furnished
I6under the Act for any purpose other than the statistical
l7purposes for which it is supplied.
18

The local governments in these cases have asserted

I9that they are entilted to the address lists because they
20wish to use those lists for statistical purposes.

But the

21 Census Act provides that only the Secretary and his agents
22may use information furnised under the Act, and then only
23for statistical purposes.

There is no provision for use of

24this material outside the Census Bureau.

25

And I might add that in a 1937 report by the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Director of the Census Bureau to the Secretary of Commerce,
2the Director noted that it was then the practice of the
3 Bureau not to -- not to employ any outside individuals for
4the purpose of tabulating the Bureau’s statistical
5 information.
6

QUESTIONS

Mr. Schulder, I have great problems

7 with the danger of somebody's address being turned loose.
8

MR. SCHULDER»

I will turn to that a little bit

91ater, Justice Marshal.
10

QUESTION»

All right, fine.

11

MR. SCHULDER»

In any event, even if disclosure to

l21ocal officials challenging the census may be deemed a
13statistical purpose, our submission is that disclosure is
14nevertheless barred under other provisions of the Census
15 Act.

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act bars any publication

16whereby the data furnished by any particular census
17respondent can be identified.

The local governments in

18these cases have argued that the Census Act bars only
l9disclosures that would identify individual census
2orespondents, and that they seek not names but merely
21 addresses.

But this contention ignores the language of

22Section 9(a)(2) which prohibits the Secretary from making
23any publication that could identify the data furnished by
24any particular establishment or individual.

25

QUESTION»

Mr. Schulder, if we go along with you

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 on your desired broad interpretation of 9(a)(1), aren't we
2in effect making (a)(2) and (a)(3) superfluous?
3

ME. SCHULDER;

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

The

4point of all of these provisions in Section 9(a) is that
5Congress wanted to make it clear and meant to leave no room
6for doubt that all raw census data within the hands of the
7Census Bureau could not be disclosed to outside persons.
8

QUESTIONS

So even if they overlap, it is in your

9 f a vor.
10

MR. SCHULDERs

11

QUESTION;

That is absolutely correct.

First to (1), would you say that if the

12 court ordered the Census Bureau to turn over an address
13list, would the Census Bureau be making use of that address
14 list within the meaning of 9(a)(1)?
15

MR. SCHULDER;

We submit that the disclosure of

16this information would come under the term "use”.
17

QUESTION;

Would be a use?

18

MR. SCHULDER;

Would be a use?

That's correct, and one that is

19 inconsistent with the whole purpose and statutory scheme.
20
21 be right.

QUESTION;

Then of course Justice Blackmun would

If that is a use, then you don't need anything

22 else.
23

MR. SCHULDER;

24

QUESTION;

That's correct.

And then under Number (2), would you

25tell me — maybe this overlaps Justice Marshal's question,

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 but how is the disclosure of an address list
2 any

way come within (2), any particular establishment or --

3 how does that relate to any
4

MR. SCHULDER:

5

QUESTION:

6 any

does that in

individual?

Kell, the —

How does it relate -- how does it make

publication whereby the data furnished by any particular

7 establishment or individual under this title can
8 identified?

be

How, by looking at an address list, could you

9 identify the source of the address?

MR. SCHULDER:

10

The point is that this particular

11

provision does not only bar disclosures that could lead to

12

identification of the source of the information.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCHULDER:

It bars --

That is what it says.

15 disclosure that could

No, it bars -- it bars any

lead to identification of the data

16 furnished by any particular establishment or individual.

It

17 doesn't go solely to identifying names of census respondents.

QUESTION:

18

Well, then, what you are saying is that

19 it really precludes all disclosure, because any disclosure
20 would include some data that came from somebody.

MR. SCHULDER:

21
22 any
23

Our point is that

-QUESTION:

24 that kind of a
25

Well, precisely.

It is a rather strange way to write

--

MR. SCHULDER:

Well, that may be true.

These

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 particular provisions of the statute were developed in the
2early part of this century.

Some of them were added at

3 different stages along the way, but the point of the
4 statutes and the legislative history bears this out, is that
5 each time that an additional provision was added to the
6Census Act, Congress made it clear that it was attempting to
7tighten the confidentiality provisions.
8

QUESTION*

I thought that all would be consistent

9with the view that they were attempting to avoid the
10disclosure of individual responses, the copy of the census
11 report and that sort of thing.
12

MR. SCHULDER*

That's true, but that -- that's

13true in part, but -14

QUESTION*

This language surely reads that way.

15

MR. SCHULDER*

Well, street address information is

l6recorded on individual responses.
17

QUESTION*

Right.

18

MR. SCHULDER*

Right.

And the mere fact that the local

19governments in these cases have asked -20

QUESTION*

But giving a list of addresses doesn't

2lreally tell you anything about what was in the response
22other than the fact that that address obviously was -23

MR. SCHULDER*

Well, except for the fact that each

24of the addresses that are listed disclosed the fact that

25those addresses contain residential dwelling units.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

But it doesn't necessarily indicate

2 that a particular address was learned through a response.
311 might have also been learned by the census taker going
4 out and looking at the building.
5

MR. SCHULDER:

6

QUESTIONS

7

MR. SCHULDER:

8

QUESTION;

Well —

Isn't that true?
That's true, but —

And if all you give is a bunch of

9addresses, how does that tell anybody who just has that list
10which ones were provided by individual responses, and which
Hones were obtained by observation?
12

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, the point is that most of the

13information here, most of the street addresses were actually
I4either confirmed -15

QUESTION;

But you can't tell from the list which

l6ones were.
17

MR. SCHULDER;

You can't -- no, that’s true, that

l8you can 't.
19

QUESTION;

But under the instructions given to the

20census takers, would they have been justified in listing an
2laddress as occupied by simply looking, say, at a number

22Plate on a door and saying, there’s a building, it must
23 h a v e —

24

MR. SCHULDER;

Absolutely not. Justice Rehnguist.

25The enumerators were specifically instructed, and the record

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in the McNichols case bears this out, that before they could
21ist an address as vacant, they had to confirm that
3 information either with a neighbor or with the owner of the
4property in question.

So there was information even as to

5 vacant units that was derived from responses to inquiries
6conducted by census employees.
7

Section 9(a)(3) of the statute prohibits anyone

8other than sworn officers of the Department of Commerce or
9the Census Bureau to examine individual reports.

The local

10 governments contend that they do not wish to examine the
11 individual census reports, which they agree may not be
l2disclosed, but the address registers are a compilation of
I3address data that appear on individual reports.

In many

I4cases, addresses are added to the registers solely as a
15result of the reports, and the reports, as I indicated
I6earlier, also verify address information obtained by the
izBureau from other sources.
18

It is hard to believe that Congress meant on the

19one hand to prohibit examination of raw information in
20individual reports and on the other to permit the
21 examination of the same information after it is transferred
22 to a different piece of paper.
23

QUESTION*

Section 9(b) --

Well, unless their interest was in

24protecting individuals from having their own private
25information disclosed.

They don't want to know -- The

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 individual presumably has an interest in not being
2identified as the source of any information, and it seems to
3 me that interest is protected by a literal reading of the
4 statute.
5

Isn't there a difference between knowing whether I

6told the census taker something and having the census taker
7 report the fact?
8

MR. SCHULDERi

It may not be possible to, as you

9indicated earlier, Justice Stevens, to ascertain -"lOcertainly the address registers don't indicate the
11 particular source of the information, and as I will develop
12a little bit later, the whole purpose underlying these
l3provisions would be undercut by any type of exceptions to
14 the confidentiality provisions that the local governments
I5propose in these cases.
16

Section 9(b) confirms the broad scope of these

17confidentiality protections that are contained in 9(a) of
I8the Census Act.

Section 9(b) refers to the provisions of

199(a), and I quote, "relating to the confidential treatment
20of data for particular individuals and establishments," and
21 the whole theme of erecting a wall of confidentiality is
22Underscored by other provisions in the Act.

23

For example, Section 1 of the Act, the

24definitional section, has a very broad definition of
25respondent that defines a respondent as any individual,

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 organization, or entity that reports information or on
2 behalf of whom information is reported.
3

Section 6 of the Act provides that to the extent

4 possible, the Census Bureau is to obtain information from
5sources other than individual respondents.

The purpose of

6 that provision was to limit the burden on respondents for
7having to respond to census inquiries.
8

It seems to me difficult to believe that Congress

9meant to subject the information obtained from other sources
lOto disclosure merely because it may have been obtained from
11 other sources.

It would be inconsistent with the purpose of

I2reducing the respondent burden and heightening the privacy
13 protections of the Act to say that information obtained from
l4other sources could be disclosed, whereas information
15obtained only from the census respondents themselves could
l6not be disclosed.
17

The legislative history of the Census Act, of the

18F0IA, and of the Privacy Act also support our reading of the
I9statute.

The history of the Census Act shows that over the

20years Congress has continuously tightened the
21 confidentiality protections of the Act.
22century, in

Early in this

1909, Congress provided the first explicit

23provision that is the forerunner of Section 9(a), which was
24applicable only to industrial establishments and mining
25 establishments.

MR. SCHULDER;

I don't believe it did, Your

We have referred to it in our reply brief in the

11 Shapiro case.
12

QUESTION:

Yes, but I wasn't sure how far it had

l3progressed in the Congress.
14

MR. SCHULDER:

I don't believe it had gotten out

15of committee.
16

In 1919, Congress enacted additional legislation

I7that is the forerunner of Section 8(c) of the Act.

That

18legislation provided essentially that information could not
I9be used to the detriment of any respondent or other person
20to whom the information related.

Now, that might lead

21 someone to argue that since Congress inserted a specific
22provision forbidding use to the detriment of any individual,
23that Congress thereby recognized

that certain information

24could be disclosed, but the point of fact is that the
25legislative history of this provision in

1919 specifically

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 underscores the fact that Congress did not mean by this
2 provision to imply that there was any kind of disclosure
3permitted under the Act.
4

QUESTION;

To what extent, if any, is the

5 confidential status of this information based on the
6 proposition that the Census Bureau must get on with the job,
7and do it within a reasonable time after the cutoff date?
8

ME. SCHULDEE;

Hell, I was just about to address,

9 Your Honor, the basic purposes of these provisions.

The

lOfirst purpose, of course, is to protect the privacy of
11 census respondents, but the confidentiality mandate of the
l2Census Act goes beyond ordinary privacy considerations.
13 Much of the census information that is being sought in this
I4case or that is collected by the Census Bureau is not
I5inherently private.

It is the sort of information that an

I6individual could gather by walking down the street and
I7making inquiries, as we indicated in our opening brief in
18Shapiro at Pages 34 to 36.
19

The point is here, though, that the major purpose

20 of these confidentiality provisions, and this is borne out

21 by the case law examining the statute and by the legislative
22history, is that the confidentiality mandate of the Act is
23meant to assure the public that the information they submit
24 will be kept secret, and by doing this, Congress sought to
25encourage public cooperation with the census.

4

MR. SCHULDER;

Of course, that is another of the

5problems involved in this -- in this and other cases that
6have raised questions concerning the conduct of the census,
7but I do want to make the point that disclosure that certain
8buildings are used as residences, may be used to the
9detriment of individuals who are occupying buildings that
10are zoned for commercial use only, or that are occupying

how many units are at a particular location , because there

is a separate address listing for each unit, so if the

address, that will reveal to local officials that there are

in fact five dwelling units within that building, and in an

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Honor, and in fact the plaintiffs were, I am sure, able to
2develop their own address lists based on tax, local taxes
3and various other local government activities.

There is no

4question that they had numerous other sources for the same
5 information.
6

One of the points we are trying to make here is

7that each of these local governments is trying to carve out
8a special exception, a special narrow exception to the
9Census Act's confidentiality mandate.

For example,

lORespondent Shapiro argues that unlike the petitioners in
HMcNichols, he should be entitled to disclosure of address
12lists, because those lists will not reveal the occupancy
13status of a building.
14

The McNichol petitioners, on the other hand, claim

15that disclosure of addresses of vacant dwellings is
16permissible because that information supposedly concerns
17non-existent persons.

These approaches demonstrate the

18unworkability of a policy providing for a limited, piecemeal

igdisclosure.

The next case that may come down the road will

20seek yet another exception to the confidentiality provisions
21 of the Act.

22

Exceptions of this sort would undermine the

23confidence of the public in the security of census
24information in the hands of the Census Bureau, and in the
25long run would reduce census accuracy by deterring numerous

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 persons from cooperating in the census.

We submit that our

2 construction of the statute, unlike that of the local
3 governments in these cases, is both workable and consistent
4with the language and history of the statute.
5

Because the Census Act absolutely bars disclosure

6of the information at issue here, there can be no exceptions
7 of the sort urged by the local governments, regardless of
8 whether the information is sought under the FOIA or under
9civil discovery rules, and regardless of the motives of the
lOparticular local government seeking the information.
11

Under the FOIA, if a particular matter is exempt

12from disclosure, the FOIA simply does not apply, and the
13needs of a requester are irrelevant.

Similarly, under the

I4civil discovery rules, privileged matter is not
15 discoverable.

In the Census Act, as we have argued, and as

16we argue more fully in our brief in the McNichols case,
17Congress established an absolute privilege barring official
l8disclosure of raw census data relating to individual
19 respondents.
20

Thus, Congress has already struck the balance, and

21 there is no occasion to balance a party’s need for this
22 information against the public's need to preserve

23confidentiality in a particular case.
24

Finally, even if the needs of the particular

25tequesters here were relevant, they are not sufficient to

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 overcome the important public policy against disclosure.

As

21 indicated at the outset of my argument, in its local
3 review program, the Census Bureau provided local governments
4with aggregate statistical information on housing,
5 vacancies, and population for each enumeration district, and
6as I pointed out earlier, enumeration districts constitute
7very small geographical units within urban areas, less than
8325 street addresses.
9

Now, the local review program was established to

lOenable local officials to provide information to the Bureau,
Hand was not intended to provide local governments with an
12opportunity to conduct what would amount to an internal
13audit of the Bureau’s operations.
14

There is no reason why Essex County and Denver

15could not have participated in the local review program in a
I6meaningful way without access to confidential census
17information.

18

For the reasons I have stated today and those

19articulated in our briefs, we submit that the Court should
2oreverse the judgment of the Third Circuit in Shapiro and
21 affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit in McNichols.

22

I would like to reserve the balance of my time for

23rebuttal .

KR. BEN-ASHERi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3 please the Court, the issue before this Court is one of
4first impression, and it is most properly framed as
5follows.

Is a bare list of undifferentiated street

6 addresses in the possession of the United States Bureau of
7the Census absolutely privileged from disclosure and
8furnishing under the Freedom of Information Act.

Our

9 position is that Title 13 does not provide a blanket of
10 confidentiality for all census materials, but rather is
11 restricted exclusively to barring disclosure of information
12which would identify any individual census respondent.

That

13 is the conclusion which has been reached by the Third
l4Circuit, by the concurring opinion of Judge Stevens in the
15Second Circuit in Carey versus Klutznick , and by the
16district courts of Colorado, New York, and New Jersey.
17

What the county of Essex is not seeking in this

I8case is access to vacancy information, to use information,
19to occupancy information, or as to units, and it is not
20seeking discovery,

and it is not seeking at this juncture to

21 challenge the validity of the census.

Rather, the county's

22Purpose is to ascertain what addresses, if any, have been
230verlooked by the Bureau,

with the result that those

24addresses would not have been canvassed, and any persons
25residing within those addresses would not have been

that the Freedom of Information Act would not

further incursions into whatever privileges and

20 confidentiality was established by the exception to the
21

22 entire legislative history.

Well, there has been a certain

23 narrowing of the exception.

It has always been a carefully

24 constructed

one, so as to avoid a ban on all census data,

25 which would

have been a rather facile means of accomplishing

1 that result had it been intended by Congress, but rather, a
2focusing on how that information might be damaging to an
3 individual, and to what extent it might reveal his or her
4 identity.
5

The thrust of the Freedom of Information Act is to

6create, in effect, a presumption that information is
7disclosable to the public because it is so critical to the
8public’s participation in the governmental process in a

Under the position for which we contend it

11 would not be protected beyond -12

QUESTION:

How long do you think that

13 realistically that would be effective, to keep it out of the
Mhands of real estate speculators, contractors wanting to

17

ME. BEN-ASHEE;

It would not be effective, and it

18should not be effective because the data on its face does
ignot provide any information as to individuals, and that is
20the prescription in the exceptions to the Census Act.

By

21 the same token, as perhaps I will discuss later, much of the
22block data which is published by the Census Bureau as part
23of its dicennial census reveals as much as if not more
24information that could be utilized in that manner, presuming
25some kind of herculean investigatory effort on the part of

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 members of the public who might choose to treat information
2in that manner, but it would not be a manner which would be

3harmful to individual census respondents or to the
4 confidentiality purposes of the statute.
5

The primary purpose of Congress, as this Court has

6enunciated in enacting the Freedom of Information Act, was

7 to assure that government would not attempt to hide its
8mistakes, and that is precisely the purpose which the county

9in this case is attempting to avoid, to engage in this
10 process and meaningfully participate in the review process
11 so as to help assure that there will not be an undercount in

I2such a critical area in which the Constitution has directed
I3enactment of this statutory scheme for the purposes -14

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 general rule.

The exception is one which the government

2must establish under its burden, and it must do so in a de
3novo trial, in which there is an opportunity to challenge
4 and obtain judicial review of their determinations.
5

The Census Act itself, which is at the heart of

6the determination which this Court must make, is one which
7 must be examined in the context of the recognition that it
8is the interest of the citizenry as opposed to the interest
9 of the Bureau which is primary, and that the confidentiality
10 provisions of the statute were enacted precisely for the
11 purpose of ensuring that there would be an accurate census
12and that individual would participate in that census.
13

Section 9, 9(a) of that statute is one which is

14 exclusively directed towards affecting the activities of
15Census Bureau personnel.

That is, that they should not

I6engage in abuses with that information when it is in their
17hands, such as using it for personal gain, not that it
18 should affect the public.

igwith disclosure.

That section has nothing to do

Even the petitioners concede in their

20court of appeals brief that 9(a)(1)

is not intended to

21 create standards and criteria for release of information to
22the public.
23

This Court has directed itself and concurred in

24that conclusion in the St. Regis case, and the express
25introductory language to 9(a) indicates that.

If in fact

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

19(a)(1) were construed to apply to the citizenry, then
2 citizens could only use published census data to the extent

3that it was not used for non-statistical purposes, and that
4is not a workable standard, and it is not one that the
5 Congress conceivably could have intended once information
6was in the hands of the public.

7

So, it is our position that it is irrelevant

8whether or not there is a statistical purpose on the part of

9an inquirer under the statute.

Alternatively, if Section

109(a) does require a statistical purpose, it is clear that
11 the purpose of Essex County in this case is statistical in

I2nature because it is directed towards enhancing the accuracy
13 of the enumeration, the precise goal for which the Bureau
14was created.

15

Whatever the meaning of Section 9, it describes

l6Section 8 as the exception to its prohibitions, and because
179 does not prohibit the disclosure of this information we
18need not reach the question as to whether Section 8 permits

I9it.

Rather, the authorization section here for this

20disclosure is the Freedom of Information Act, but Section
218(b) does require the disclosure of statistical materials,
22and any reasonable reading of that term semantically must

23Conclude that the address lists are indeed statistical
24materials.

QUESTION:

New Jersey, of course, is going to the

Bureau to get the information, and therefore we run into the

11

problem.

The Bureau may not release it, and data must mean

12 something other than names of individuals,

13
14

MR. BEN-ASHER:

I suppose.

Yes, and certainly the county does

not contend that, as the government represents, that it is

15 limited to individuals.

The interpretation of 9(a)(2),

to

16 the extent that that language helps us construe the meaning
17 of the prohibitions in

is critical to the case, you are

18 correct, and it is our position that in referring to that
19 data. Congress intended to bar the disclosure of information
20 which would identify any particular individual.
21

The government argues that 9(a)(2) means that what

22 is prescribed as the disclosure of identifiable data
23 relating to individuals.

Well, of course, all census data

24 relates to individuals, but that test is more amorphous and
25 more unworkable and less in keeping with the legislative

QUESTION;

Whether it identifies a particular

14 individual, and not whether it identifies a particular

16

MR. BEN-ASHER;

No.

The source is not the focus.

17And the location of the data in the records is not the basis
18for the inquiry.

The question is as to what it discloses,

igwhat the nature and content of that data is.
20

QUESTION;

Is that perhaps a little bit of a

21 distortion of the plain language when it says the data

MR. BEN-ASHER;

There are difficulties that all

We are focusing on the content of the information

15as opposed to its location, and St. Regis dealt, Justice
160'Connor, with the point you raise as to the meaning of
179(a)(2).

I think the reference in the St. Regis case by

I8this Court to that statute is even a narrower reading than
igthe one for which the county contends, because there it was
20characterized as referring to the name or identity of those
21 furnishing information being revealed.

22

The Bureau implies that if information can lead to

23further information about an individual, it would be barred

But it doesn’t say that, does it?

11

MR. BEN-ASHER:

Neither does the statute expressly

utilize the language which the Bureau is contending for, but

13

what we are attempting here to do and what the Court’s duty

14

to do is to construe the language in a common sense way in

15

light of the legislative history and its practical

16

application, and what we have said is that if that section

17

is applied mechanically, it would bar our information, but

18

it would also bar the Bureau from publishing the forms which

generally publishes as a result of the dicennial census.

MR. BEN-ASHER:

What is on that list are a number

3 of items which are correctly characterized by the
4government, but we are not seeking all of the items on that
5 register.

We are only seeking what is found in Column 2 and

63 of the sample master address register which is attached to
7 the multi-district litigation brief, which is that showing
8the number of a lot and the street name of the lot.

That is

9 exclusively what we have sought throughout this case.
10

QUESTION:

Isn't that list available in Essex

12

MR. BEN-ASHER:

There are various versions of

13lists that are available from various sources, but what has
14not been available to this point is the Bureau's address
15list, and that is the one that the government correctly
16characterizes as being at the core of the census process.
17

QUESTION:

You want the government's list rather

18than the list.

MR. BEN-ASHER:

We don't want the list.

Well, to the extent that human

3 addresses, that's correct.

It’s from a number of sources.

4 It is pre-collected in effect and represents a passive
5 effort of the Bureau to a certain
6 contention that that is not the

extent, but it is our

test.

The ultimate question

MR. BEN-ASHER*

That is a result which they could

But was that their purpose in mind?

8

MR. BER-ASHERs

No, the purpose of the Congress

9was to preclude the disclosure of individually identifiable
lOdata which would be harmful to an individual.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Ben-Asher, on that point, after the

12 St. Regis paper case, in which this Court said that certain
13copies of census reports kept by a business establishment

I5in effect overruled this Court's holding, did it not?

And

I6it indicated when it did that that it changed this Court's
17 ruling to add further protection of privacy.

18

Now, let me read you from the Senate report, and

igthen ask you to comment on that, where it explained that it
20was doing this to ensure that the authority of the Secretary
21 of Commerce to furnish statistical tabulations or other

22material to public and private entities does not extend to
23any material which might disclose information reported by or

MR. BEN-ASHER:

I think the language of the
The amendment was a very narrow

3one, directed towards precluding disclosure of a very narrow
4category of information.

The holding of this Court in St.

5Regis was a broad one, to the effect that 9(a)(1) and the
69(a) sections applied only to the government, and that the
7 statute did not generally clothe census data with

13

MR. BEN-ASHER;

Congress when it accomplished that

141962 amendment did not rethink or clarify the fundamental
I5nature of the exception in the statute, as it could have
I6easily by simply prescribing release of any census data.
17Rather, its response was a very narrow one, to indicate that

MR. CERRONE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

1 Court the general chronological order of events in the
2McNichols case.

If I may, I would add only very briefly to

3 his description.
4

One of the very important things that happened

5 during the census or just subsequent to the actual census
6day in Colorado as well as all through the nation is what
7 was enumerated or described as a local review program.

This

8 local review program has been mentioned by the government as
9being an opportunity wherein the local governments and local
lOofficials can participate in the review of the census.
11

One of the things that is in the record, and which

121 feel obligated to bring forward to the Court, is the fact
13 that whether or not and to what extent living units were
14 vacant could not be discussed was not an issue in the local
15review program.
16

Subsequent to that, the city and county of Denver

17did file our action, and have made our request, but prior to
18making our request, we had a hearing before the district
19court on our application for a preliminary injunction.

At

20that hearing, we presented evidence showing very clearly, I
21 believe, that the total count of the population of the city

22and county of Denver was too low, and the total count of the
23vacancy units, that is, the living units in the city and
24county of Denver was too high, and that there was a causal
25connection between the too high vacancy rate and the too low

17of legal issue is going to be floating up and down in the
18case, too?

19

MR. CERRONE;

Your Honor, first of all, with

2orespect to the Colorado case,

there is no way that we can

2igain the number of persons required to change the
22apportionment of the 435 seats in Congress.

But to answer

23your question fully, it may very well be that as a result of
240ur success,

other localities may feel that they should

25challenge the census in a like fashion that we have,

and it

54

1 is possible that the numbers may be such that it will result
2 in such a consequence.

3

My answer. Your Honor, is very simple, that if in

4 the event that there was a miscount in New Mexico, or if
5 there was an undercount in New York, or wherever it happens
6 to be, then

7

that has got to be corrected.

The question that was posed by one of the Justices

8 earlier regarding -- regarded the expediency, and the Chief

9 Justice also mentioned the time which it would take us to do
10

this, but also the uses to which the census data are put,

11 and
12

we all know that in 1982 we are going to have a national

election for the House of Representatives, and in fact in

13 Colorado we have a governor’s race and so forth, that
14 obviously these kinds of data are going to be used for those
15 purposes.
16

QUESTIONS

How?

You say you couldn’t come up with

17 enough extra numbers to get Colorado another seat.

MR. CERRONEs

Yes, Your Honor.

So is it really just a question then of

There is no —

Our cases don't say that apportionment

9

MR. CERRONE*

There is no requirement in the

10 Constitution or the statutes or any case of this Court with
11 respect to whether or not states must use federal census
12data for reapportionment, but the fact of the matter is that
I3every one of them do, and the reason that they do is because
14it is the only game in town.
15

QUESTION*

Yes, but if somebody sues, and says

MR. CERRONE;

Your Honor, to continue, the issue

18conduct our own census.

The fact of the matter is, we don't

ighave the wherewithal to do it.

We didn't gin up to do it.

2011 would cost us probably more to get to the point where the

QUESTION:

3

MR. CERRONE:

No, we haven't.

And in 1970 there was no lawsuit
In

1970, Your Honor, we weren’t

4aware — or our awareness of the fallibility and peccability
5 of the Census Bureau wasn't as high as it is today, after
6having looked into it, and after having suspected for one
7reason or another in 1980 that they didn’t do their job
8properly, we did become aware.

Not only did we become

9aware, but 50, 60 other jurisdictions have become aware.
10

There are, as I understand it, at least 50 cases

11 now in a consolidated case, consolidated by the U. S. Panel
12 of Multi-District Litigation in the district in Baltimore,
13in Maryland.
14

Justice Stevens asked earlier to address the plain

15language of the statute.

I will address the plain language

l6of the statute. Justice Stevens, by saying that there is
iznothing in that statute that is applicable to a court except
18how Congress amended the Act with respect to respondent
19retaining copies, and that is the only place where there is
20any mention as to restrictions on judicial disclosure.

QUESTION*

If that is your point about no mention

4 of courts.
5

MR. CERRONEs

That is one of the legs of our

6argument, Your Honor, but we would go further, and I think
7we brought this out in our brief, that -- and as the
8district court held, that it is obvious that there was some
9sort of intent and purpose of Congress in enacting this
lOentire scheme in the statute, and that in view of that, that
11-- and the district court held that the purposes and intent
12 of the statute can be maintained by having a discovery order
I3that recognizes the purposes and intent of the statute, and
14that is what the district court did.
15

It has been -- I could characterize it as a

I6gualified privilege.

I can characterize it as coming under

17the government reprort doctrine, all of which has gone into
18the brief.

What I want to say today, however, is that the

igdistrict court recognized, and I think that it was correct
20in recognizing that the intent and purpose of the statute
2lhas to be maintained, if for no other reason, for the public

22 perception.
23

Public perception is --

24

QUESTION:

Well, you are saying, well, sure, this

60
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the Congress didn’t want to keep it from being discovered in
2 litigation as long as the court entered a proper order that

3 would protect the secrecy of it.
4

QUESTION:

5 Justice White.

So long as -- so long as two things,

Not only that the court order a proper

6 protection order --

QUESTION:

So you disagree with your colleague

8 from New Jersey, or do you,

that Section 9 reaches —

9 protects this information, or not?
HR. CERRONE:

10
11

Fortunately, Your Honor, for my case

I don’t think it matters.
QUESTION:

12

You can say, assume that it does.

The

13 court amply protected it.
14

MR. CERRONE:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

How long do you think it could remain

16 protected, once it is part of a deposition or other pretrial
17 discove ry?
MR. CERRONE:

18

19 a deposition.

Your Honor, it will not be a part of

What was ordered by our district court was

20 that these lists be provided to our
21 been sworn
22 out

23

people, who have already

to secrecy, and that they use these lists to go

and check the vacancies.
QUESTION:

And this would be an in camera analysis

24 by the judge and the -- presumably the lawyers in opposition?
25

MR. CERRONE:

Your Honor, the district court also

61

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 suggested -- he recognized that he couldn’t order -- I think
2he could have ordered, but he did not order, but he
3suggested that the Bureau go along with us, have somebody
4come along with our people when they go out there and check
5as to whether or not it is vacant, and that would increase
6the speed at which this can be done.
7

QUESTION*

How long do you think it would be

8before the Denver Post and the other newspaper out there
9would be in court either as an intervenor or plaintiff to
lOstop this pernicious secrecy?
11

MR. CERRONE:

12

QUESTION;

Your Honor, I don't think that --

Do you think that might have a tendency

l3to slow up the whole litigation process?
14

MR. CERRONE:

No, Your Honor.

As I was starting

15 to say with Justice White, there are two conditions under
I6which this information was made available to us, not only
17the protective orders, but the fact that we had shown in an
18application on preliminary injunction in which one of the
19issues is the likelihood of success, we showed that we had
20something there.

We showed that it wasn’t a frivolous

2iaction, that we were — that the purposes of our asking for
22this information were the same purposes for which it is used
23by the Census Bureau, that is, ensuring an accurate count of
24the people of the city and county of Denver.

25

QUESTION*

You could show that the taking of a

62
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 census was not a traditional First Amendment place where
2 people gather to discuss public issues, too, I suppose.
3

MR. CERRONEs

4

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor, I suppose we can.

It is sort of ironic, I suppose.

Under

5your opponent's reading of the statute, they couldn’t rebut
6your case by putting in their own list of vacant places,
7 either, could they?

I suppose they couldn't use the

8 information in court in order to defend the accuracy of
9their own results.
10

MR. CERROhE*

Your Honor, it goes right to the

11 issue of the case in total.

The issue of our case is

I2whether or not their list of vacancy units is correct.

The

13court has given them the opportunity to come along with us
14 to verify it.

If their list is correct, it is correct.

If

I5it isn't, then we are going to -16

QUESTION;

Well, going along with you doesn't

17 necessarily answer the question whether it was vacant on
18April 1st of 1980, of course.

19

MR. CERROHE*

Your Honor, as I have indicated

20earlier, it is going to be difficult, and especially in view
21 of this protracted litigation, but it can be done and it
22must be done.

It must be done because, as the Court knows,

23this case and especially in our locality, in our region, has
24?otten an awful lot of publicity.

The public perception has

25been mentioned before, and I think that the public will be

63
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 able to distinguish when this Court has approved a discovery
2order with all the protections that are involved.

I don’t

3think that the press is going to mislead them, and I think
4that they are intelligent enough to make the distinction.
5 But they also know that the city and county of Denver
6believes that its people were not correctly counted.
7

QUESTION;

Counsel, the trouble with me is, you

8want to keep the names confidential, you do and the
9government does.

So you go out and you find that this house

lOwhich the government said was vacant on April 1 wasn’t
11 really vacant, it was occupied by John Jones.

Now, there is

12his name right out in the public.
13

ME. CERRONE;

Your Honor, and that is exactly, I

I4believe, why the district court required that our people be
15deputized in the words of Justice Rehnquist, that is, sworn
16to the same type of secrecy that the regular Bureau people
17are, because that is exactly what this fellow is going to

l8do.

That is, the employee of the city and county of

igDenver.

He is going to find out that Johnny Jones lived

20there, and he is going to take Johnny Jones' name and give
21 it to them.

22

And he is going to hopefully forget it.

But in any event, as many protections in that

23Process that are possible have been made by the district
24COurt.
25

Your Honor, the last point I would like to make to

64
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the Court, or observation I would make to the Court is, with
2 respect to the St. Regis case, which has been mentioned
3earlier, the St. Regis case developed on the facts, as we
4 all know, that suddenly the FTC wanted to have respondent
5 retain copies of census reports.
6before.

This had never happened

There was never, at least insofar as we can tell,

7 an occasion where another branch of government wanted to
8have these kinds of things which are retained by the
9 respondents.
10

When this case came to this Court almost 18, 20

11 years ago, this Court held that Congress didn’t provide for
I2that, therefore they have to be resolved.
13situation exists in this case.

That same

No one really dreamt, as it

14was brought up by some of the questions that I have
I5answered, in '70 and in *60 that we would, that is, the
l6localities would be so aware that there is a problem with
I7the Census Bureau.

No one anticipated that in learning that

I8there was a problem, that we would start asking for
19 information such as this, least of all Congress.
20the identical situation.

This is

This statute which restricts the

21 truth, this privilege must be strictly construed, just as it
22was in St. Regis, and in the event that Congress doesn’t
23feel that it is correct, in the event that Congress feels
24that this is a hole in the dike, that a finger must be
25pushed,

then it is up to them as they get into St. Regis to

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 80-1436 AND

7

THE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 80-1781 - REBUTTAL

8

MR. SCHULDER t

Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to

9make several brief points.

Counsel for Essex County has

lOattempted to argue that if our interpretation of the Census
11 Act is correct, then the Census Bureau has no authority to
l2disclose even the statistical information that it normally
13does after conducting the dicennial census.
14

Well, the point is that Section 8(b) of the Act

I5specifically provides authority for disclosure of
16 tabulations and statistical materials, so long as those
17disclosures do not refer to information reported by or on

18behalf of individual respondents.
19

Now, the test that we have proposed for

20interpreting the confidentiality mandate of the Census Act
2ican be found at — summarized at Page 17 of our brief in
22McNichols.

And basically what that test is, under the Act,

23°nly aggregate statistical information may be disclosed, and
24even then the information may not be disclosed if those
25statistical figures may disclose information reported by or

66

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 on behalf of an individual respondent.
2

This interpretation is supported by the opinion of

3 the Attorney General that we have cited in a footnote on
4Page 30 of our brief in Shapiro.

In that opinion, the

5 Attorney General addressed an inquiry concerning the
6disclosure of names and addresses of certain employees in an
7upstate New York city, and also names and addresses of
8people who the Census Bureau had found were illiterate.

The

91atter group of names and addresses were sought by
10 educational and other public service institutions that were
11 attempting to conduct a literacy campaign.
12

The Attorney General's opinion indicated that the

13Census Bureau felt its obligation to preserve the secrecy of
I4this sort of information to be so strict that it would not
l5disclose even statistical information in certain
16communities, if that information would lead an individual to
I7identify the particular establishments or individuals that
18the information related to.
19

Next, I would like to point out and underscore

20what I attempted to say earlier, that even a bare list of

21 addresses such as is being sought by Essex County could be
22harmful to individual respondents, because the address lists
23that are maintained by the Bureau refer not to commercial
24properties but to residences, so that if a commercial
25Property contained a residence, and the Bureau discovered

67
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this in the course of the census, that address would be
21isted on the Census Bureau's address lists.
3

Now, the address on the county's -- the county may

4not have a residential listing for that particular address.
5Therefore, the disclosure of this information would identify
6particular units that are being used for residential
7purposes that the county or local government may not know
8about, and such use may be in violation of local housing
9codes or zoning ordinances.
10

QUESTION*

In the McNichols case, suppose they

11 filed an affidavit or a series of affidavits which showed
I2that 100 percent of the houses you declared vacant were
I3actually occupied on April 1.

How would you go about

I4disputing that?
15

MB. SCHULDER*

If that information were brought to

I6the attention of the Census Bureau in the course of the
17conduct of the local review program that I described
I8earlier, and if the information were sufficiently broken
igdown into enumeration district totals, so that the Census
2oBureau could check the city's figures against its own
21 figures, then presumably the Census Bureau would be able to
22correct its figures in line with what the city had found.

23

QUESTION*

Suppose they did not.

24

MR. SCHULDER*

Suppose that the Bureau did not

25correct its own figures?

HR. SCHULDER;

In a court

4that there is any room for judicial review of the census
5 process.

I mean, that is your position, that you

11 can't just -- you can't get in court on it.

19

MR.

20

QUESTION*

SCHULDER*

Perhaps, yes.

Well, you have to take that position,

21 because under your reading of the statute, which may be
22right, you couldn’t put in countervailing evidence on
23specific locations, I don't think.

24

MR. SCHULDER*

I believe that that is probably

25 correct.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

QUESTION;

So you almost have to take the position

2that this sort of issue doesn't belong in Court.
3

MR. SCHULDER;

That would be a use that would be

4barred by the statute under our reading.

That is correct,

5 Your Honor.
6

QUESTION;

Doesn't it go even beyond the statute?

7Doesn't it come down to the question of, under the
8Constitution, what entity is charged with conducting the
9census, the executive branch, the legislative branch, or the
lOjudicial branch?
11

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, I believe that is correct.

12The Constitution specifically provides that the dicennial
I3census shall be conducted in a manner that Congress shall
Mdirect and Congress has provided in the Census Act for the
l5conduct of the census by the Secretary of Commerce and his
16delegates, in this case the Census Bureau.

Was there a preliminaryinjunction?

5Yes, there was.

MR. SCHULDER:

A preliminaryinjunction

was not

The case is still pending technically in the

8district court at the preliminary injunction stage.

QUESTION:

Well, apparently they have gone to it

10 in part at least on a claim for judicial review of
11 administrative action.

That is the allegation in the

12 complaint.
13

QUESTION:

Mr. Schulder, I guess your case is a

I4little more difficult, isn’t it, in the McNichols situation,
15where we are dealing with possibly, anyway, only a qualified
16privilege as far as a judicial discovery order is concerned .

MR. SCHULDER:

Well, we don’t believe so, Justice

Our position is that the Census Act establishes

igan absolute privilege, and in fact the advisory committee
2onotes to the Federal Rules of Evidence seem to indicate that
21 there was an absolute privilege established by the Census
22 Act.

QUESTION:

Even though Congress didn't expressly

24say so

QUESTION:

-- although it does in many instances.

HR. SCHULDER:

That's correct.

Well, counsel for

3 Denver points out that the only specific language in the
4 Census Act that actually immunizes Census Bureau or census
5information from discovery and lawsuits is the legislation
6 that was enacted after St. Regis that discusses retained
7copies by census respondents, but if his theory is correct,
8 that would mean that copies of individual reports could be
9 discoverable if
10 and

they were in the hands of theCensus Bureau,

that simply cannot be the case, and theCourt

in St.

11 Regis made it quite clear that census information in the
I2hands of the Census Bureau simply was not discoverable in
13any

judicial or administrative proceeding.

Thank

you very much.
