CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We will hear arguments next

You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Tyler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD R. TYLER, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TYLERi

8

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

9 Court, the petition of the American Society of Mechanical
10 Engineers,
11

which as you know is frequently referred to in

the record as ASME, submits that this case casts up in

12 simple terms the following issue,

and that is the question

13 of on what basis can the acts of two of the society's
14 voluntary members of this non-profit, scientific and
15 technical society be imputed to that society for purposes of
16 establishing liability under the Sherman Act.
Now, the panel below answered this question

17

18 substantially as follows, and I am really quoting in large
19 measure from Page 19 of the joint appendix.
20 for
21

The panel said,

ASME to be liable then, Hydrolevel, the plaintiff, had

to demonstrate only that ASME's agents, that is, two

22 voluntary members,

acted within their apparent authority

23 when participating in the conspiracy.

It, Hydrolevel, did

24 not have to demonstrate that they also acted in part to
25 benefit ASME or that ASME ratified their activities.

1

We contend that this holding is incorrect, and that

2 this Court should reverse the reasoning and

judgment of

3 liability entered by the court of appeals.

Sow, the facts which set the stage for this

4

5 relatively simply stated issue here in this Court --

QUESTION:

6

On that point, might I ask you, Mr.

7 Tyler, whether it isn’t true that the trial court instructed
8 on

quite a different standard than apparent authority?
MR. TYLER:

9
10

He certainly did, Justice O’Connor, and

as a matter of fact —
QUESTION:

11

You have no quarrel with the trial

12 court’s instructions or the results thereof?

MR. TYLER:

13

No, we don’t believe that we have any

14 purpose or right to be quarreling with Judge Weinstein's
15 instructions.

QUESTION;

16
17 not

That is correct.
And the court of appeals, however, did

review the record in terms of those instructions?

18

MR. TYLER:

19 happened in

Essentially, that is correct.

What

the --

20

QUESTION:

But you want us to.

21 reverse,

we would -- if we agreed with you that the court of

22 appeals’

reasoning was wrong, the basis for his decision was

23 wrong, in order to reverse,

If you ask us to

we would have to then review the

24 record ourselves.
25

MR. TYLER:

Well, I think that we would agree with
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that, but what we are really urging is two things
2 two possibilities here, Justice White.

We see

One, we concede that

3 you, if you agree with us, could reverse and remand this
4 case for consideration under appropriate principles of law
5 to the court of appeals.
6

QUESTION;

7

MR. TYLER;

Right.
We would like to persuade you, however,

8 that if you look at the record, the facts are really very
9 simple, and not really in contest, and that on the basis of
10 those facts —
11

QUESTION;

Yes, except that the jury found against

12 you.
13

MR. TYLER;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. TYLER:

-- we claim that there is no -Except that the jury found against you.
Indeed, we have to conceded that the

16 jury found
17

QUESTION:

find so somebody would have to say that

18 no reasonable juror could arrive at that position on the
19 record.
20

MR. TYLER;

21

QUESTION;

Yes, I know you do.

22

QUESTION;

Mr. Tyler, don’t you run the risk, if

We do contend that.

23 you ask us to look at the record -- say we agreed with your
24 legal theory — that we might look at it and say, yes, there
25 is enough evidence here to support the jury finding, and
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

therefore affirm on a different basis?

You only have one

2 shot.
3

MR. TYLER;

4

QUESTION*

5

MR. TYLER*

6 evidence point here
7

You are willing to take that risk.
But we claim that the sufficiency of
is very acute, and we stand on the

proposition that if you look at the facts, there is no

8 basis,
9

I understand that.

whether we are talking about apparent authority,

actual authority to hold this society, particularly when the

10 agents were not working for the society when they did what
11

they did to bring themselves into the conspiracy.

12

Let me just repeat these facts.

I am sure you will

13

recall most of them.

14

issues here really occurred in 1971.

15

two long-time members of the society, one of them a man

16

named James who then was the vice president of McDonald and

17

Miller, which then and now was a major manufacturer and

18

distributor of low water cutoff devices for pressure vessels

19

and boilers, Hardin, who was the vice president of Hartford

20 C.
21

The facts which set up the legal
In March of that year,

Boyler, a big insurance company, sat down in the Drape

Hotel for dinner with some other officers of McDonald and

22 Miller.
23

For our purposes, the principal subject of talking

24

was how they could use the knowledge of Hardin and James to

25

put a letter in in the normal course or what appeared to be

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the normal coarse to the Boiler Pressure Vessel Committee of
2 ASME and to get an answer which might help McDonald and
3 Miller or MEM compete against Hydrolevel unfairly in the
4 marketplace.

Hydrolevel, as you will recall, at the time

5 was a small company, had never had any commercial success,
6 but had developed a so-called probe type of low water cutoff
7 device for boilers, which incorporated a time principle.
8

As a result of that meeting in Chicago, a letter

9 was prepared with the help of Hardin and James, signed by a
10 man named Mitchell, a sales official of MEM, sent in what
11

purported to be in the regular course to this committee of

12 ASME.
13

It came into the hands of the secretary of the

14 committee, a man named Hoyt, who in the regular course
15 transmitted it to Hardin, who was then chairman of the
16 relevant subcommittee of the Boiler and Pressure Vessel
17 Committee.
18

It appears quite clear that Hardin had something to

19 do, a great deal to do with the preparation of the response
20 which went out to M£M on or about April 12th.

Hydrolevel's

21 counsel suggests that Hardin did this almost alone.
22 isn't quite true.

That

It is true, however, that James, oddly

23 enough, wasn't visible at that time, and hence it seems to
24 us he can't be held to have had any apparent authority
25 because he really wasn't visible.
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

In any case, the loaded letter got a loaded

1

2

response.

3

that sales representatives of M8M went out into the

4

marketplace and used this letter unfairly to depreciate, if

5

you will, the Hydrolevel prop.

6

And after that, the record is perfectly clear

Now, I will stop there, although of course there

7

are other facts in the record, and I am sure not only my

8

opponents but perhaps myself will get to those, but these

9

are really sufficient to set up the legal problem, because

10

we contend that contrary to what the court of appeals held,

11

these facts show that these two men, Hardin and James, or

12

one of them, weren't acting to benefit the society at all.

13

They quite clearly were acting to benefit another principal,

14

McDonald and Miller.

15

Now, to step back a moment, you will remember in

16

the court of appeals there were two issues of liability that

17

Hydrolevel and ASME addressed.

18

that on these simple facts, Hardin and James appeared to be

19

acting as members of the society, and therefore somehow they

20

had actual authority to join this anticompetitive scheme.

21

We argued to the contrary.

22

First, Hydrolevel contended

In addition to that, Hydrolevel said, look, if we

23

are wrong about actual authority, later on, somehow, the

24

society, with full awareness of what was going on, ratified
what Hardin and James were up to.

The court of appeals

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

didn’t really confront either of those issues

2 an apparent

They came to

authority analysis of this case, as you know,

3 and it is something which neither side did brief at all.
4

Now, very briefly, we contend that whether we are

5 dealing with relevant, appropriate provisions of master and
6 servant law or agency law,

and furthermore, if you look at

7 settled law on what it takes to have someone become a member
8 of

a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade under

9 the Sherman Act, the court of appeals analysis just doesn’t
10 hold water.
11

Now, you will recall that the court of appeals does

12 refer to in

its opinion a number of sections of the

13 restatement of agency, which they say fit this case.

It is

14 interesting because those sections in the 240s, if you look
15 in the table of contents of the restatement of agency, it is
16 instructive to see that those are regarded by the draftsman
17 as dealing with specific and limited torts of an agent, and
18 thus permitting under certain circumstances tying in those
19 agents, masters, or principals.
20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Tyler, can I interrupt you with one

question that troubles me a little bit?

I think the

22 predicate of your argument is that Hardin did not benefit

23 ASHE at all when he answered the phoney letter of inquiry.
24

MR. TYLER:

25

QUESTION:

That’s right.

He --

Supposing the letter had not been a
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

phoney, but had been a routine inquiry, and he had answered

2 it in a

3

routine fashion.
MR. TYLER;

Would he then have benefitted ASME?

Well, I suppose that if he by some

4 quirk had said something which was obviously not in keeping
5 with ASME's rules, or in some other fashion obviously was
6 designed on its face to help somebody in

the marketplace

7 unfairly compete with a competitor, but I don't see how -QUESTION;

8

Is the function of a person in his

9 capacity of answering letters of inquiry, does that provide
10 any

benefit to his principal?

11

MR. TYLER;

12

QUESTION;

Well, in the sense -Supposing it is an innocent letter, a

13 routine inquiry, do you have a code that applies to cutoff
14 valves.

He writes back and says, yes, we do, the section

15 number is so and so.
16

MR. TYLER;

Does that benefit —
Yes.

That is fairly close to what

17 Hydrolevel, I think, is arguing.

My answer to that is, for

18 purposes of establishing treble damages, particularly, under
19 the antitrust laws, it cannot be said that he would be
20 benefitting his principal,
21

22

writing a letter which turned out

to be unfair, incorrect, or whatever, used against -QUESTION;

In other words, does the question of

23 whether he was benefitting his principal depend on the
24 nature of the inquiry and the nature of the response?
MR. TYLER;

If you look at Section 235 of the
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

restatement, it is quite clear that that deals with an agent

2 who intends
3

not to benefit the society, for example, in

these circumstances, but somebody else.

4 hypothetical,

Taking your

I suppose it could be said that there, he

5 didn't intend to benefit anybody outside, and since he was
6 doing his normal work as a volunteer,

but that leaves out

7 the point that you wouldn't have knowing involvement in

an

8 antitrust conspiracy.
9
10

QUESTION;

Well, maybe the benefit is insufficient,

but it seems to me that --

11

MB. TYLER;

12

QUESTION;

It is insufficient.
— answering mail for a principal does

13 provide at least the benefit of getting

the letter off the

14 desk and getting it answered.
15

MR. TYLER;

16 happened, he would

I cannot deny that if that is all that
be performing in the normal course in his

17 role at that time as chairman of
18 think that removes us from
19 treble damages in

22

what we have got here, a suit for

which the pleadings and the arguments of

20 the plaintiff were that
21

this subcommittee, but I

Hydrolevel -- excuse me, ASME

somehow became a knowing member of a Sherman Act conspiracy.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tyler, aren't you -- did you

23 really want to make this jury speech here?

It seems to me

24 that your threshold submission is that this case should
25 judged on the basis that let's assume that

there was no

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

be

1 benefit, that the court of appeals couldn't have cared less
2 whether there was benefit or not, so we judge the case on
3 the assumption there was no benefit for the principal.
4

MP. TYLERi

5

QUESTION:

There was no benefit for the principal
Well, I know, but whether there was or

6 not, the court of appeals didn’t decide.

They said, even i

7 there is no benefit for the principal whatsoever, the
8 principal is liable.
9

MR. TYLER:

10

QUESTION;

11

HR. TYLER;

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TYLER;

14

QUESTION;

That's right.

And we say --

That is what you want to —
We say that that -You want us to reverse that.
Absolutely.
And so we don't have to get into an

15 argument about whether there was or wasn't benefit, writing
16 this letter.
17

MR. TYLER;

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. TYLER;

Oh, yes, we do.
Well, I know, you -Because the court of appeals put the

20 issue up here, by saying -21

QUESTION;

No, they said even if there is no

22 benefit, the principal is liable.
23

MR. TYLER;

24

QUESTION:

And we say that is wrong.
I know, but then you want us also to go

25 on and say there was no benefit.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1
2

MR. TYLER;

No, no, we are saying — we don't ask

you to do any more than agree with us that if you look at

3 this record -4

QUESTION;

I thought, if the case comes here, the

5 court of appeals said, even if there is no benefit, the
6

principal is liable.

7

MR. TYLER;

8

QUESTION;

And the court of appeals is wrong.
All right, but you don't have to argue

9 then whether the letter was a benefit or not.

You just

10 assume that it wasn't.
11
12

13

MR. TYLER;

No, no, I was attempting to address

Justice Stevens' hypothetical.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but he just picked you up

14 on an argument that you were making that there was no
15 benefit —
16

MR. TYLER;

17

QUESTION;

Fair enough.
— which is irrelevant to your first

18 submission.
19

MR. TYLER;

No, it is not irrelevant.

If you look

20 at Section 235 —
21

QUESTION;

Well, if you have to convince me that

22 there was no benefit here in order to reverse the court of

23 appeals decision in this case, you are going to have a lot
24 of trouble.
25

MR. TYLER;

All right.

I will take that trouble on.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

All right.

2

(General laughter.)

3

HR. TYLER;

Well, don't bother for now

There was, in every situation that you

4 can find discussing liability, Justice White, under the
5 antitrust laws or any other case where a plaintiff is
6 seeking more than compensatory damages, punitive damages,
7 exemplary damages, there is no case by this Court or any
8 lower federal court, including an antitrust case, that has
9 ever allowed Sherman Act liability where an employer
10 obviously didn’t benefit if only because the agents were
11 doing things like -12

QUESTION;

I can understand that argument.

I can

13 understand that argument.
14

MR. TYLER;

15 not here.

All right, and we are saying, that is

We are saying that for a long period of time,

16 ASME didn't even know what Hardin or James were up to, and
17 whatever they did or didn't know, there was no benefit to
18 ASHE except this lawsuit, which is expensive —
19

QUESTION;

The court of appeals said, even if there

20 was no benefit, they are liable.
21

MR. TYLER;

22 than that.

The court of appeals said a little more

The court of appeals said, they are responsible,

23 that is, the society, because of the acts of these two men,
24 even though they didn't know about them, and even though the

25 society did not benefit, and that involves a very important
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 principle of law.
2

QUESTION:

Mr. Tyler, you have cited a number of

3 cases in support of your argument, including something
4 called United States versus American Radiator and Standard
5 Sanitary Corporation, in which we had denied cert.

That was

6 apparently an antitrust case.
7

MR. TYLER:

8

QUESTION:

9 spoke as follows:

Yes.
And the Court's opinion in that case
"A corporation is legally bound by the

10 acts and statements of its agents done or made within the
11 scope of their employment or their apparent authority.”

*

12

MR. TYLER:

13

QUESTION:

Ah, yes.
And it goes on and says, "When the act

14 of the agent is within the scope of his employment or his
15 apparent authority, the corporation is held legally
16 responsible for it."
17

MR. TYLER:

I didn't understand why you cited it.
Well, I will tell you why we cite it,

18 because in that case, unlike this case, and there are a
19 number of additional ones we cite of this type, Justice

20 O'Connor, it was quite clear that the agents or employees
21 were doing in an anticompetitive sense things that they
22 thought would benefit their principal.
23

QUESTION:

But certainly the language which I read

24 you of the opinion would indicate that the court would not
25 share your view.
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. TYLERi

Standing alone on that language, I

2 understand you fully.

But if you will analyze the case in

3 its entirety, you will see, quite obviously, unlike here,
4 the employer in question was in commerce, at least in the
5 commerce subject of the case, and the employees were acting
6 in the scope of their employment, doing the things they
7 shouldn't have been doing under the antitrust laws.
8

We have no quarrel with that kind of holding.

9 presents quite a different case.

This

Here is a society which by

10 statute and as a practical matter is made up of about
11 100,000 individuals, now, not companies, not firms, and here
12 were Hardin and James, sitting down and agreeing with a
13 commercial organization, which is a competitor of
14 Hydrolevel, we can do some things to skew the procedures of
15 the society to help you in the marketplace.
16

That wasn't done to benefit the society.

That is

17 quite different from the case you cite, and others, Hilton
18 Hotels and others, as you quite perceptively point out.

We

19 really discuss in large measure both sides here, a lot of

20 these cases, but we say that it is important to keep this
21 distinction in mind.
22

Let me turn to something else which the court of

23 appeals did which standing alone the case is still a good
24 case.

You remember, they decided that this turned on

25 something called the Gleason case, which was decided in the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 late 1920s, and counsel for Hydrolevel, of course,
2 understandably relies on that, and that was a case where,
3 unlike here, the plaintiff was seeking to recover
4 compensatory damages only against a common carrier, where
5 the facts show very clearly that the agent was really
6 faithless to his master.
7

And there, this Court held, and we do not quarrel

8 with that holding, that for purposes of allocating risk of
9 loss to a plaintiff like this, or put differently, to allow
10 a plaintiff to be compensated, the principal would be
11 charged even though he didn *t know at the time what the
12 agent was up to.
13

»

However, we say that this Court long ago recognized
that distinction in a case which oddly enough was handed

15 down by this Court two years after the Sherman Act was
16 passed.

It is a great case to read, not just because we

17 think it supports us, but because it analyzes both themes or
18 threads of authority in the law.
19

First, Hr. Justice Gray, writing for this Court,

20 said, look, the law — he discussed for the Court the
21 evolution of common law in certain classes of cases where to
22 allocate the risk of loss to somebody's damage, the courts
23 would permit the imputation of liability for compensatory
24 damages to such a plaintiff, where it was clear from the
25 record that the principal didn't kwow what was going on, and
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the agent seemed to be seeking to benefit himself and not
2 the principal.
3

But then, the case facing this Court, and it is

4 called, by the way, Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway
5 versus Prentiss -- it is in our reply brief -- Mr. Justice

6 Gray said, but there is another rule where a plaintiff goes
7 further and seeks to get exemplary, deterrent, or punitive

8 damages, and there the law is that that plaintiff will have
9 to show that the principal of this agent benefitted from

10 what he was up to.
11

Now, that seems to me to go back to what you

12 raised. Justice White, and today, that case is followed
13 consistently by the lower federal courts.

It is the federal

14 rule, we maintain.
15

Therefore, to sum all this up, we say that on the

16 peculiar facts of this case, about which there is no

17 dispute, here we have a plaintiff which admittedly had other
18 remedies which it abandoned in the court below for suing

19 ASME, for example, for what New York calls a prima facie
20 tort, plaintiff now seeking to recover treble damages
21 against this society, even though the plaintiff well knows
22 that the society didn’t have the requisite understanding of
23 the Sherman Act cases to know that an anticompetitive scheme
24 was going on, and received no benefit.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SCHWARZ;

it please the Court, this appeal is from a jury verdict

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

ASME, liable for treble damages under

both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, a verdict rendered

10 upon instructions from the trial judge that are not being
11

challenged on appeal, as we have just heard.

12

Indeed, the jury's conclusion that the law was

13

violated is also not being challenged, but is expressly

14

conceded by the ASME.
The only issue before this court is whether the

15
16

ASME, as a corporation, is to be held responsible under the

17

doctrine of respondeat superior for the damage caused by

18

that violation.
With the Court’s indulgence, I would like to make

19

20 two observations at the outset.
21

First, there were two

physical exhibits introduced at the trial, the two devices

22 in question.

We have brought them here so that the Court

23

can see.

This is the probe; this is the float.

3

filed on behalf of Hydrolevel.

4

Ackerman, who is an ASHE member, and one of the amicus

5

curiae, developed in his brief, one which I highly recommend

6

to the Court, that the ASME's presentation in this Court

7

totally fails to address two principles that are basic to

8

agency law, and that should be most important to every

9

professional, and particularly the professional soceities

11

that administer standards that have the force of law.
Those two principles are duty and responsibility.

12

Those that assume a great responsibility should have a

13

correspondingly great duty, not only to Hydrolevel for fair

'

treatment, not only to the public at large for setting
15

standards that promote competition and do not entrench

16

monopolists, but to itself and its own members, as Hr.

The second observation I would like to make at the

I listened in vain to my brother’s presentation and
the words "duty” and "responsibility" were never mentioned.
The case as presented to the court of appeals

21

involved only the question, as my brother has pointed out,

22

whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to

23

support the jury’s conclusion that the ASME's agents were at

24

least in part, at least in part, acting on behalf of or for

25

the benefit of the ASHE, or secondly, whether the ASME by
20

1

its subsequent acts and statements or failures to act

2

ratified the unlawful activity.
The court of appeals found it unnecessary to reach

3
4

these two questions, because it decided that a third

5 principle of

respondeat superior, that of apparent

6 authority, had clearly been satisfied,
7

and justified the

imposition of liability.

8

I would like in my presentation first to explain

9

why the decision of the court of appeals was correct, and

10

then to demonstrate why there are two alternative grounds

11

for affirmance, that of actual authority with intent to

12

benefit and ratification, and I note in this respect that

5

MB. SCHWARZi

Which is not a bad result.

Your Honor, on the ASME’s challenge

6

to the holding of the court of appeals with respect to the

7

issue of apparent authority, it really is on two levels.

8

First, it argues that because the doctrine of apparent

9 authority does not

require an intent to benefit, which all

10

agree is the case, even though the ASME suggested a charge

11

to the jury which the district court adopted to the

12 contrary, that

that doctrine should not be available in any

13

antitrust case, and as a matter of fact, they argued that it

14

should not be available in any case with even arguably

15 punitive aspects.
16

It is, the argument goes, somehow unfair to punish

17 the principal for acts of dishonest or disloyal agents where
18

those acts were not intentionally authorized by or known to

19 the principal,
20 benefit the
21

principal by the disloyal agent.

QUESTIONi

and where those acts were not intended to

Is that a factor?

MR. SCHWARZ:

25 agree now that the

apparent authority issue, I think all

issue of benefit is not relevant.
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Whether there was benefit or no benefit, the important
2 thing, as the court of appeals pointed out at some length,
3 is whether there was an aura of agency and authority imposed
4 upon the agent by the principal which was relied upon by
5 third parties to the detriment in this case of Hydrolevel.
6

Now, I submit that if this Court accepts that

7 argument, it would be rejecting the very reasons for the
8 existence and development of the law of respondeat
9 superior.

It would be overturning decades of settled law,

10 and that law has never made any exceptions to the
11

application of respondeat superior law or the law of agency

12 to particular cases such as this.
13

QUESTION;

How about the Lake Shore case, relied

14 upon by your opponent?
15

MR. SCHWARZ:

Your Honor, that Lake Shore case,

16 with all due respect, says that a corporation cannot be
17 assessed with damages that are punitive unless the president
18 or general manager knew of in advance and approved those -19

in that case, I believe, a conductor beat up a passenger --

20 those acts in advance.

I suggest with all due respect that

21 that case has not been followed.

I suggest that in effect,

22 that is the General Electric defense in the antitrust
23 cases.

He didn't

I think that case is no longer being

25 followed, in that respect.

QUESTION:

There is a fair body of law, though,

isn't there, in all fields that says that where you seek to

3 assess either punitive or treble damages,
4 higher test

you are held to a

than where you are merely talking about

5 compensatory damages?

MR. SCHWARZ:

6

Your Honor, I believe you may have

7 reference to the Standard
8

Oil of Texas case, which our

opponets have made a great point of in their brief.

9 like to distinguish

I would

that case and that line of cases in one

10

respect.

Those cases relied basically upon the assumption,

11

or those cases that I am thinking of relied basically on the

12 assumption that there has to be a specific intent involved
13 in the very

violation.

In that case, for example, there was

14 a statute at issue which required knowing and

wilful

15 violation of that statute.
16

In that case, the two disloyal and dishonest agents

17 were stealing from

the principal, and the court of appeals

18 was faced with a situation where the government was arguing
19 that the intent,

the dishonest intent of the two employees

20 that were stealing from the principal should be imputed
21

to

the principal for purposes of criminal prosecution of the

22 principal.
23

In those circumstances, I have no quarrel with the

24 holding of
25 that should

the court of appeals that that is not the result
follow.

Our case, on the other hand, is a
25

Sherman Act case.

The Sherman Act, Sections 1 and 2 of the

2

Sherman Act do not require a specific intent.

The statute

4 that has the purpose or effect —

MR. SCHWARZ;

No, sir.

I am not saying that.

I

9 suspect —
10

QUESTION;

Then what is your distinction?

11

MR. SCHWARZ;

Well, I want to point the Court's

12 attention to the A£P Trucking case.

In the United States

13 versus A&P Trucking, this Court held, and that, I might
14 point out, was also a criminal case, and this is why I do
15 believe that the Lake Shore case, even though it has not
16 been expressly overruled, is no longer valid, the A£P
17 Trucking case said, and I quote, “It is elementary that such
18 impersonal entities," referring to corporations, "can be
19 guilty of

'knowing ' or wilful violations of regulatory

20 statutes through the doctrine of

22

QUESTION;

respondeat superior."

That

I do suggest --

Was that before or after the Gypsum case

23 that this court decided a few years ago?
24

MR. SCHWARZ;

25

QUESTION;

That was before.

Do you think in the antitrust context it
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would survive Gypsum?

2

MR. SCHWARZ;

Yes, sir, I do.

I think Gypsum

3

expressly stated basically the same concept.

Now, the

4

doctrine of apparent authority, like the law of agency as a

5

whole, is really bottomed on one premise, and that is that a

6 person who extends his power and influence by utilizing
7 others to do his work should be responsible for the damage
8 caused in the course of doing that work.
9

In an actual authority situation, the principal is

10

bound by the exercise of authority he actually gives to the

11

agent.

12

bound by the exercise of authority he represents to the

13

world that the agent has.

In an apparent authority situation, the principal is

14 exclusive.

The two are not mutually

An agent may and frequently does have both

15 actual and apparent authority from the principal, and that,
16 we submit, is exactly what

is the principal bound on a theory of negligence,

except insofar as he has made a poor choice of agents.

22 both cases,

In

the principal is bound by his own act of

23 conferring actual or apparent authority.
24

Now, apparent authority is not, as the ASME would

25 have this Court believe,

an exception to the general rule of
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 respondeat superior.

Fraud and the other torts that were

2 mentioned by my brother during his presentation is no less a
3 conventional tort than assault, and I submit that apparent
4 authority is designed and has always been a part of the law
5 of respondeat superior simply to take into account those
6 types of torts where it can most commonly occur.

That rule

7 of apparent authority has been around as long as the Sherman
8 Act.
9

If Congress had intended that corporations or

10 non-profit associations were to be liable only for
11 anticompetitive acts expressly authorized or ratified by the
12 board of directors of a corporation, or intended to benefit
13 the corporation, it could have easily done so.

As a matter

14 of fact, as the court of appeals pointed out, the fact that
15 the antitrust laws are so basic to this country's economy
16 makes it that much more important that the courts not remove
17 any legal incentive for antitrust vigilence on behalf of

18 industry.
19

The second level of the ASME’s argument on apparent

20 authority is that even if apparent authority is applied to
21 other corporations, industrial corporations, it should be

22 not available against non-profit corporations such as the
23 ASKE, because they are organized only to do good things for
24 the public,

and they should not have to bear the terrible

25 financial risks that the antitrust laws impose.

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I suggest that there is nothing in the legislative

2 history of the antitrust laws to suggest that Congress
3 intended any special treatment for any class of persons, and
4 the definition of persons in the Sherman and the Clayton
5 Acts clearly encompasses non-profit as well as even
6 eleemosynary institutions such as churches and others.
7

I suggest that the opposite is true.

It is more

8 important to continue the apparent authority concept in
9 effect against non-profit corporations because otherwise
10 they would be exempt from the antitrust laws altogether.
11 The proposition advanced by my opposition that everything
12 done by the ASHE is for the benefit of the public, and not
13 for the benefit of the ASHE, means that it could never be
^

14 held responsible for any unlawful act except through an
15 apparent authority concept or by direct ratification.
I would like to address one point that I think is

16

17 important from the context of the brief of the other side.
18 It is said frequently, what could we have done to avoid
19 this?

We have 10,000 people writing codes, 100,000

20 members.

What could the ASHE have done to avoid what

21 happened to Hydrolevel?
22

The ASHE suggests that it is being asked to pay

23 astronomical damages for something caused by only two
24 disloyal agents.

I submit that very few basic changes in

>
25 the way they do business would protect the ASHE quite

The record fully supports the verdict on the ground

The ASHE's

as I have just pointed out, treated the jury

7 to a barrage of testimony and judicial admissions to the
8 effect that the interpretation, the

letter was accurate,

9 proper, issued in full accordance with the ASHE's
10
11

procedures, and ASHE stood by it.
In the face of those admissions, it would have been

12 impossible for the

jury not to have concluded that it was

I would like first to explain

24 why the jury's verdict should be sustained, and then
25 describe the serious adverse effects which would result from
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 acceptance of ASME's contrary theories.
2

As the briefs in the record in this case vividly

3 demonstrate, private organizations which prescribe standards
4 for products sold in interstate commerce have great power to
5 improve economic performance and great power to inflict
6 economic harm.

Standardmaking activities can facilitate

7 commerce by increasing consumer information and by promoting
8 product safety.

However, those activities also can deprive

9 consumers of new and valuable products, and inflict serious
10 injury on competitors, dangers which are heightened by
11 conflicts of interest which often are present in codemaking
12 bodies.
13

The code interpretation which caused the

14 competitive harm in this case appears as the first appendix
15 to the red brief filed by Hydrolevel.

That interpretation

16 bears the names of all of the officers of ASME' Boiler and
17 Pressure Vessel Committee, is signed by the secretary of the
18 committee, and expresses the views of the chairman of the
19 concerned subcommittee on the intent of the ASME code.

20

The evidence at trial showed that the chairman of

21 the subcommittee had expressly delegated authority to render
22 code interpretations of this kind, and it is conceded that
23 the interpretation was made pursuant to ASME's standard
24 operating procedures.

ASME persuaded the district court

25 that it should not be held accountable for this document

3

QUESTION*

Is it your position that apparent

4 authority is sufficient for liability in this case?
5

MR. SHAPIRO*

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

It is

6 indeed.

We agree with the court of appeals that the

7 doctrine of apparent authority is available in antitrust
8 cases as in comparable tort suits.

Apparent authority has

9 been the basis for many jury charges in federal antitrust
10 cases in the past, some of which are collected in the
11 American Bar Association’s volume entitled Jury Instructions

12 in Criminal Antitrust Cases.
13

The apparent authority doctrine has been approved

14 in antitrust cases by the Sixth, the Third, and the Second
15 Circuits, and the -16

QUESTION*

Now, is there a difference in those

17 approaches on whether it is an organization created for a

18 profit, a conventional manufacturing institution, or an
19 organization like this?

20

MR. SHAPIRO*

The courts have never drawn any such

21 line, and indeed this Court’s decisions have held in many
22 situations that the non-profit entity is subject to
23 precisely the same rules as the profitmaking entity.
24 Congress extended the prohibitions of the Sherman Act to
25 every person, including non-profit associations, as this

QUESTION;

2

That wouldn't be necessarily the

3 complete answer, would it?
MR. SHAPIRO;

4

Your Honor is correct.

None of the

5 apparent authority cases in the antitrust area that we rely
6 on dealt specifically with non-profit entities.

That is

7 quite correct, and I do acknowledge that point.

However,

8

this Court's decisions have treated non-profit entities on a

9 par with other profitmaking entities in the past, and we
10

think the same approach is appropriate here.
ASME nonetheless argues that codemaking bodies in

11

12 the situation should

13 unawareness.

be able to rely on a plea of

This, we submit, if accepted, would undermine

14 the incentives that Congress created under the antitrust
15 laws.

If courts were to accept this plea, it would

16 encourage codemaking bodies to look the other way in the
17 face of the everpresent danger of anticompetitive behavior
18 by officers with conflicts of interest.
19

Effective deterrence of anticompetitive behavior in

20 organizations such as ASME is of

crucial importance to the

As the House Subcommittee on Small

22 Business stated in its Report Number

1981, in the 90th

23 Congress, Second Session, at Page 75, and I quote, "Private
24 bodies for promulgating standards are performing what is
25 essentially a governmental function.

The standard may

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 result in economic prosperity or economic failure for a
2 number of businesses of all sizes throughout the country."
3

If ASHE wishes to take upon itself authority to

4 render interpretations that have life or death importance
5 for American businesses, it must also take responsibility
6 for the actions of those persons to whom it commits
7 codemaking power.

It is clear enough that ASME is willing

8 to take credit for the achievements of its codemaking
9 officers, and to receive many millions of dollars annually
10 from the sale of its codes.
11

Hr. Shapiro, is your argument directed

12 solely to organizations such as this that promulgate
13 standards?

14 standards.

Would you be making the same argument?

16 principles of agency law apply regardless of the —
17

QUESTION;

So your emphasis on that aspect of the

18 case does not affect your basic position or limit it.
19

HR. SHAPIRO»

It does not.

It reflects our

20 enforcement concern, however, with this category of case.
21 There are 400 standardmaking bodies affecting products sold
22 in interstate commerce, and our concern there is that the
23 antitrust laws be enforced effectively to prevent restraints
24 of trade which these entities can so easily impose.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD R. TYLER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. TYLER;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

on rebuttal, let me make a few points.

return first of all to something which I think Justice White

8 got into this morning,
9 answered him, and

and I am not sure that I clearly

I think I should.

We concede that at the minimum, we are seeking to

10
11

Let me

have this Court remand this case to the court of appeals to

12 decide under what we regard as the appropriate rules of
13 antitrust liability.

whether or not there was a benefit

16 to the company.

MR. TYLER;

We would say that — The court of

that even if there was no benefit, that there

was liability, and we would have to say that was wrong, if

22 we agreed
23

with you.
MR. TYLER;

That’s right, and as a matter of fact,

24 that leads me to my second
25 Messrs.

point, because as I understand

Schwarz and Shapiro, they continue to try to argue
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that somehow we are seeking some sort of antitrust immunity

2

or benefit that others do not have under the antitrust laws

3 of the United States because this is a not for profit
4 organization.

That is not the case at all.

We wish to

5 simply see ASME governed by the rules that commercial
6 organizations or individuals are governed by, and here,

for

7 example, what they continue to do is to say that we want you
8 to somehow think that we are standing the rule of respondeat

9 superior on its head.

We are not.

It is very simple.

10
11

the first comment thereunder.

12

always been the law.

Let me read you Section 235 in
It is right here.

It has

"An act of a servant is not within the

13 scope of employment if it is done with no intention to
14 perform it as a part of or incident to a service on account
15 of which he is employed.

Comment.

The rule stated in this

16 section applies, although the servant would be authorized to
17 do the very act done if it were done for the purpose of
18 serving the master, and although outwardly the act appeared
19 to be done on the master's account."
That puts it very neatly.

20
21

In other words, we admit

that these two men did these things apparently cloaked in

22 their role as members, but that is what this rule is all

23 about.
24

Let me turn to another point which I think is very

25 important, and I think we can -- it is not really another
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 point, but it illustrates the perniciousness of this
2 argument that somehow we should be bound in this kind of a
3 case on these facts.

Like I assume many of us here, I am a

4 member of the bar association, the City Bar of New York.
5 am an officer.

I

I am a member of the executive committee,

6 and thus I would have power to go to, let's say, the ethics
7 committee in that bar association, and because I wanted to
8 serve my law firm, not the bar association, I saw a chance
9 to diminish a competing firm which had a very juicy client
10 if I could skew up an opinion of the ethics committee
11 dealing with the behavior of that law firm.
12

I would think we would all agree, no one would want

13 to say that the City Bar of the city of New York was liable
14 for my faithless conduct.

I wasn’t acting for them.

15 using their authority in a very real sense.

I was

I was

16 masquerading using their trappings, their building, my role
17 as an officer, and so on.

But no one would think I — I

18 hope we would all agree — that the city bar would be liable
19 just because I did something awful.

20

QUESTION:

When you say no one, do you include your

21 people on the other side?
22

NR. TYLER:

I hope they would agree.

23 members of the bar association.

They are

Maybe not the City Bar of

24 New York.

25

I turn to my third point.

Mr. Schwarz is just

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 wrong when he says that Lake Shore and Michigan Southern
2 Railway is no longer good law.

As a matter of fact, the

3 court of appeals panel in this case cited, albeit on a
4 slightly different point, they cited a case which upholds
5 Lake Shore, discusses it.
6 the Ridgely Bank case.

It is the United States versus

Our own main brief and reply brief

7 discuss other cases, including cases in the Second Circuit
8 of very recent vintage, which recognize that 1892 decision
9 by this Court is still good law.
10

Another point.

I turn to this argument which Mr.

11 Shapiro made here this morning -- the government brief I

12 think also casts it up -- suggesting that ASME and similarly
13 situated voluntary member societies have enormous power.

I

14 think he uses the phrase "economic power", or whatever kind
15 of coercive power.

Well, I don’t want to say that ASME can

16 go around recklessly avoiding its purposes and its duties to
17 with whom it ever deals, but the fact is that the real power
18 only comes to ASME’s codes and standards when a government
19 like Mr. Shapiro's and my federal government adopts those

20 standards, or the states, or the provinces of Canada.
21

That is when the real coercive power.

22 an interesting thing in another way.

And this is

If you will notice in

23 the record, the joint appendix -- I think it appears at 79
24 -- of just what happened here, after Hydrolevel complained
25 to ASME, after April of 1971, about this letter, which of

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

Hydrolevel at all, Hydrolevel complained.

There was a swift

3 response, which again Mr. Schwarz tries to tell you never
4 occurred and never does even now.
5 case.
6

It occurred right in this

On May 4 and 5 of 1972, in St. Paul, Minnesota, for

two days, all kinds of people came in and on the docket was

7 the complaint of Hydrolevel.
Thereafter, contrary to what he insinuates even

8

9 here today, the final June 9th,
10 to 300.

’72, letter was circularized

He tries to suggest it is less, but the record is

11

clear, 300 persons.

But finally, if you will notice who was

12

shown in the record to be in those meetings, it is very

13 important to the government point, there were government
14 people present.

You will see on 79 what are called

15 conference members.

These are men clearly identified, and

16 women, who are officials of state governments, who were
17 there listening, and the reason, of course, is, these were
18 regulatory officials whose states had adopted some form or
19 another of a code or standard put forth by ASME.
20
21

So, it is just not so that ASME has been recklessly
and indifferently careening around the landscape of

22 America —
