CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. McDONOUGH, ESQ. ON BEHALF

8

OF PETITIONERS BOHEMIAN DISTRIBUTING COMPANY

9

AND WINE 6 SPIRITS WHOLESALERS OF CALIFORNIA

10
11
12

MR. McDONOUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
The California statute at issue in today's

13

proceeding is Section 23672 of the California Business

14

and Professions Code.

15

importer shall not purchase or accept delivery of any

16

brand of distilled spirits unless he is designated as an

17

authorized importer of such brand by the brand owner or

18

his authorized agent.”

19

this statute and I will refer to it in argument as the

20

California designation statute.

21

It provides:

"A licensed

The parties have referred to

The judgment below ordered Respondent Rice,

22

who is the Director of the California Department of

23

Alcoholic Beverage Control, to refrain from enforcing

24

the designation statute, this determination based upon

25

the Court of Appeals' judgment that the statute is

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

invalid under the Sherman Act

2

The court did not quite say that the statute

3

was being held invalid per se, but that indeed was the

4

thrust of the opinion and that could only have been the

5

basis of the judgment, because there was no factual

6

record before the Court of Appeals of California

7

pertaining to the effect of the statute on either

8

intrabrand competition in the sale of distilled spirits

9

in California or interbrand competition, and indeed

10

because by virtue of various stays that were ordered

11

during the course of the proceedings below, the statute

12

never did go into effect for practical purposes.
Now, the case was necessarily decided under

13
14

the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution,

15

although that constitutional provision was not mentioned

16

in the Court of Appeals' opinion.

17

be a preemption case in the true sense under the

18

supremacy clause, because it has long been decided th8at

19

the Sherman Act does not preempt for exclusive federal

20

regulation economic matters and affairs of the several

21

states.

22

This of course cannot

From Parker v. Brown to the New Motor Vehicle

23

Board case, it is clear that the states may regulate

24

economic enterprise.

25

as a case in which it is contended that the designation

So this can only be then adjudged

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statute conflicts with the Sherman Act in such a fashion

2

as to be invalid under the supremacy clause.
This Court has often said and held, and we

3
4

have quoted those opinions in our brief, that every

5

effort should be made in adjudging a conflict or claim

6

to conflict case under the supremacy clause to interpret

7

the two statutes in such fashion in relation to each

8

other as to avoid a conflict between the federal and

9

state law.

The court below did not mention those cases,

10

nor did the court proceed in accordance with their

11

teaching .
There is no conflict between the designation

12
13

statute and the Sherman Act, for the Sherman Act surely

14

does not require that every California wholesaler of

15

distilled spirits have the right to vend every brand of

16

distilled spirits that is manufactured in the land and

17

sold in California.

18

universal compulsion on everyone to deal with everyone

19

else .

The Sherman Act does not lay any

20

Nor does the Sherman Act impose any restraint

21

on every device, agreement, or statute which may impose

22

some limitation on intrabrand competition.

23

court so held even with respect to private arrangements

24

imposing limitations on intrabrand competition in the

25

GTE-Sylvania case, where the Court held that such

Indeed, the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

restraints must be adjudged under the rule of reason

2

rather than on the basis of holding a statute or a

3

practice per se in violation of the Sherman Act.
The Court of Appeals did not apply the rule of

4
5

reason in adjudging the validity of the designation

6

statute.

7

because there was no factual record before the court

8

with respect to the factors that would be relevant to a

9

rule of reason analysis or determination of the validity

10

Indeed, the court could not have done so

of the statute.

11

The statute was struck, down without regard,

12

for example, to the market share of any distiller who

13

might in the future decline to designate any particular

14

wholesaler, without regard to whether in the facts of a

15

particular case there was a large amount of intrabrand

16

competition because the particular distiller had elected

17

to appoint a substantial number of wholesalers.

18

was no consideration of what the interbrand competition

19

situation might be.

There

So the case was not adjudged under the rule of

20
21

reason.

Now, we think that the California designation

22

statute cannot be held to be in conflict with the

23

Sherman Act for two individual, separate and sufficient

24

reasons;

25

contemplate or provide for, authorize or purport to

The first, because it does not involve or

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

immunize any combination or contract or conspiracy by

2

anybody to do anything; and because it does not compel

3

or authorize or immunize any particular restraints on

4

intrabrand competition that might be established by any

5

particular pattern of designations and non-designations

6

by any particular brand owner.

7

is a sufficient reason.
Ever since Parker against Brown it has been

8

9

Each of those we think

clear, of course, that the mere fact that a legislature

10

enacts a statute does not violate the Sherman Act.

11

question of violation can only come up if the statute

12

authorizes some conduct by private individuals which may

3

The

violate the Sherman Act or which does.
It is the statute here that precludes the

4
5

importation of non-designated brands.

6

operates, as of course many statutes do, by reference to

7

private conduct which may have preceded it and made it

8

effective.

9

QUESTION*

The statute

Kr. McDonough, can I ask you a

20

question there?

21

that Oklahoma has finally decided the effect of its own

22

statute is to prevent the import — the export of these

23

products to California.

24

continuing significance as a practical manner?

25

I think we’ve recently been advised

MR. McDONOUGHi

Does the case have much

Yes, I think it does, Your

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Honor, for several reasons.

2

Supreme Court decided was that there was no requirement

3

that an Oklahoma -- that a brand owner sell to an

4

Oklahoma distributor for sale outside the state.

5

appears — that appears to leave it open to brand owners

6

now to impose contractual limitations on Oklahoma

7

wholesalers.

That

Whether those can be effectively enforced is

8
9

First, what the Oklahoma

not clear.

The lawyers who have been involved in that

10

case are not at all clear what remedies would be

11

available to a brand owner who imposed that limitation

12

if it were not observed.

13

Second, Your Honor —

14

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t they have the remedy

15

of just refusing to continue to deal with that

16

wholesaler?

17

MR. McDONOUGH:

Well, I think it's not at all

18

clear, because of the fact that Oklahoma is an open

19

wholesaling state, until we get a specific case in which

20

such a limitation is imposed and violated, the thing is

21

taken to court and there’s been a discontinuance.

22

The second thing is that in the briefs of the

23

Respondents they have assured the Court that there are

24

sources of supply available to them from various sources

25

outside the state and that this is a situation in which

g

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

they can obtain the liquor and sell it.

2

understand their representation to the Court to be.
QUESTION;

3
4

This is what I

Is that a post-Oklahoma decision

representation ?

5

HR. McDONOUGH;

6

QUESTION;

7

HR. KcDONOUGH:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

I see.
Finally, Your Honor, I think

8

that California is entitled to have this statute on its

9

books in any event, because there have been at least two

10

situations in the recent past where there were open

11

wholesaling states, Hinnesota first, now Oklahoma, in

12

which there was an opportunity to sell outside the

3

state.

4

may go to an open wholesaling law and permit sales

5

outside the state.

6

would be entitled to have the statute on its books

7

against the possibility.

8
9

It's not clear whether and when some other state

So it would appear that California

I think it is the case that at the moment we
can suppose the Oklahoma connection is not quite as

20

alive and well as it once was, but I don’t think it’s

21

disappeared, particularly in light of the

22

representations of the Respondents.

23

QUESTION;

Would the volume of such sales have

24

any relevance?

Assuming you're correct, that there

25

should not have been an invalidation on a more or less

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

per se basis, one of your arguments at least is that

2

maybe there should be sort of a rule of reason analysis.
If that approach were taken — although I

3
4

understand you go beyond that in your argument -- if

5

that approach were taken, would the volume of this kind

6

of — these sales be relevant?
MR. McDQSCUGHi

7

Yes, I would think it would,

8

Your Honor, in connection with any individualized case.

9

We have to suppose a particular case in which a

10

particular California wholesaler would seek an

11

opportunity to vend a particular brand , in which

12

opportunity was denied him, and then the question would

13

come up as to what effect this particular set of facts

14

had had upon competition in the sale of distilled

15

spirits in California.

The market share of the distiller would be

16
17

relevant, one would think.

18

competition, the volume of sales; if it were a de

19

minimis volume, it probably wouldn't raise the

20

question.

21

The amount of intrabrand

But I think the question is still there,

22

because again one of the situations in which this kind

23

of statute and the kind of vertical arrangement that is

24

necessary or desirable, at least from the point of view

25

of the Petitioners and many commentators, is a situation

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

where someone is trying to introduce a new brand into

2

the state and wants to, in order to make that

3

introduction most effective, to have his wholesaling in

4

the hands of a relatively small number of people who

5

will have the incentive to promote it.
So again, in that situation it may be that the

6
7

volume involved is relatively small, but the

8

justification for the restraint on interbrand

9

competition would be at its maximum.
QUESTION*

10

Could I ask, I take it your

11

position is, though, that even if on a rule of reason

12

analysis you would conclude that, absent this

13

designation law, there was a violation of the Sherman

14

Act, that even so the law would protect it from attack

15

under the Sherman Act?

MR. McDQNOUGH;

16
17
18

Honor.

No, no, not at all, Your

Our view is exactly the —
QUESTION*

Oh, really?

So that if absent this

19

law this would be a violation of the Sherman Act you

20

would say that the law could not — the California law

21

could not immunize it?

22

MR. McDONOUGH:

Exactly, exactly.

If the

23

situation were one, for example, where the Department of

24

Justice thought it appropriate to —

25

QUESTION*

Well, do you think that's the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

situation of the amicus brief filed by the Department

2

here ?

3

MR. McDONOUGHs

Yes, it*s my understanding

4

that that indeed is the thrust, the precise thrust of

5

the amicus brief.

6

validity of the designation statute on the understanding

7

that it does not purport to immunize any conduct that

8

would otherwise violate the Sherman Act from being

9

adjudged in such violation.

The Department's brief argues for the

And it is indeed, that is

10

the basis upon which we think the statute clearly does

11

not offend the Sherman Act.

12

It is as though -- and every state statute

13

must be enacted as though it said, and this one

14

certainly does say that, subject to whatever

15

restrictions the Sherman Act may otherwise place on

16

interbrand competition or on restrictions of interbrand

17

competition, the statute undertakes to support.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

So this conduct is not protected

under the Parker against Brown analysis for any reason?
MR. McDONOUGH;

Well, Your Honor, that's not

21

the -- we have made a separate argument under Parker

22

against Brown.

We have further made a separate argument

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, if you've made a separate

argument under that, why wouldn't — aren’t you arguing.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

then, that your conduct is just immune from Sherman Act

2

liability?
MR. McDONOUGHs

3

All right, Your Honor, I

4

understand the point you’re making.

5

separate argument under the Twenty-First Amendment.

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. McDONOUGH:

We have also made a

I understand that, too.
All right.

Now what I'm

8

addressing at this moment is, independently of whether

9

those arguments prevail or do not prevail,

and assuming

10

that they do not and that this Court were then

11

nevertheless to reverse this particular case on the

12

ground that there is -- that the case has to be adjudged

13

under the rule of reason and we fail to prevail on our

14

other grounds, then in that event the statute would not

15

immunize the conduct from inquiry under -QUESTION;

16

My question, my first question, was

17

whether you weren’t submitting that, however violative

18

of the Sherman Act your conduct might otherwise be, this

19

law protects you from Sherman Act liability on the

20

Parker v. Brown basis.
MR. McDONOUGH;

21
22

arguments.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. McDONOUGH;

25

We have made both of those

Honor.

Yes, yes.
You're quite right. Your

But independently of those, we think the statute

©

1

-- if those arguments do not prevail with the Court and

2

if the situation is one where the Court says that the

3

statute is not valid under those provisions, then we say

4

it’s still valid under the Sherman Act because it does

5

not seek to immunize the conduct of individuals that

6

otherwise would be in violation of the Sherman Act.
Your Honor, I believe 1*11 reserve the balance

I'm here today on behalf of the states that

import of the Court of Appeals' decision that's before

us today.

23

very easy to get the impression that if any state liquor

statute affects competition in some material way,

25

automatically you must say, let's start with the Sherman

They're worried because if you read that it's

Act
He believe that the Court has told us for some

3

45 years, starting with the Young's Market case and

4

going through all of the cases — Ziffrin, Seagram's,

5

McKittrick, and Midcal — that where we have a pure

6

importation situation, or in Midcal they talk about the

7

structure of the distribution system, that then we look

8

to see first if the Twenty-First Amendment applies.

9

And I think it's important as to where you

10

start, because if you start with the Sherman Act you

11

possibly and very readily come to a different

12

conclusion.

13

Amendment, then you say that the burden is on the people

14

attacking the statute, because they have to show that

15

the Twenty-First Amendment has not granted this power

16

over importation to the state.

17

Sherman Act, the state has to come in, it’s a negative

18

kind of a thing, and say, well, the Sherman Act doesn't

19

cover us because.

20

If you start with the Twenty-First

If you start with the

And so the states feel that we don't want you

21

to change the law, we don’t want you to do anything

22

except tell us that what we think you’ve told us for 45

23

years is still the law, that we're in a pure importation

24

case, we have the right to regulate the industry.

25

Now, if you look at the Midcal case upon which

can see a great difference.

concern whatever with importation.

6

the statute.

7

The Midcal case had no
The Midcal case was

In California, the wholesaler in the very

8

statute we're talking about, or the importer, must bring

9

the goods to rest.

It's the second sentence of that

10

particular section that the court said wasn't relevant.

11

But they have to bring the goods to rest in the state.

12

So that by the time in Midcal you get to the

13

price-fixing law you have nothing whatsoever to do with

14

importation at all.

15

And the other thing I would like to mention.

16

Your Honors, is that the briefs both of the Respondent

17

and the Solicitor seem to infer that there's very meager

18

evidence of any state purpose, and I must confess that

19

when I first got this case and looked at it, I looked at

20

this statute and I tried to find legislative history.

21

Your Honors well know that when you're dealing with

22

state legislative history it's a difficult problem to

23

find anything except most of the time mere supposition.

24

But then -- I guess it's serendipity of some

25

kind or another — I started to read the statute again

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and I started to read the other night the whole

2

Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, and it suddenly dawned

3

on me that there is a specific purpose.

4

purposes we’ve discussed is the preservation of the

5

three-tier structure of the distribution system, and I

6

want to go into that.

Now, one of the

But Your Honors, the first section of the

7
8

Alcoholic Beverage Act is Section 23001, and it says:

9

"This division is an exercise of the police powers of

10

the state for the protection of the safety, welfare,

11

health, peace and morals of the state, to eliminate the

12

evils of unlicensed and unlawful manufacture, selling

13

and disposing of alcoholic beverages, and to promote

14

temperance in the use and consumption of alcoholic

15

beverages."
Then it goes on to say:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Weickhardt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE G. WEICKHARDT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
HR. WEICKHARDT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
What is fundamentally wrong with this statute

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is that it authorizes private parties to prohibit

2

otherwise legal interstate commerce which would exist in

3

a free market.

4

a distiller may prevent interstate movement of goods

5

which he originally and voluntarily sold without any

6

restrictions on resale as to customer or territory.

Under this private system of regulation,

Now, the Respondents are fully licensed by the

7

8

State of California to import liquor.

They purchase

9

liquor in Oklahoma from Oklahoma jobbers who obtain this

10

liquor from the distillers without any restrictions on

11

resale.

12

California wholesalers, also without restriction.

The liquor is resold by the jobbers to the

Now, both the California wholesalers, the

13
14

Respondents here, and the Oklahoma jobbers observe all

15

applicable state and federal regulations as to the

16

interstate movement of this liquor.

17

Respondent wholesalers compete with wholesalers who

18

purchase directly from the distiller — these are the

19

so-called franchise wholesalers — except the

20

Respondents sell to California retailers for less than

21

the franchise wholesalers because they charge a lower

22

markup.

23

In California, the

Now, the designation procedure at issue here

24

works like this.

If the distiller agrees to designate

25

his franchisees to import but nobody else, then all

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

non-designated importers are prohibited from importing

2

that brand.

3

prohibit trade in goods which were not purchased

4

directly'from the distiller, but were purchased from a

5

third party without any restriction on resale, goods

6

which have become the full legal property of the

7

Respondent and which in all previous sales, these goods

8

have been sold without restriction.
Now, this designation procedure is a violation

So to recapitulate, the distiller may

There's nothing wrong with that, is there, if that's as

18

far as it goes?

19

He designates a -- one
Now, isn't that

Suppose the state law authorizes him to do that.

MR. WEICKHARDT:

The violation is the

exclusion of the Respondents.

22

for him to agree .to designate a particular wholesaler.

23

MR. WEICKHARDT;

3

Yes, because this statute

gives that -QUESTION;

4

I’m not asking about this statute.

I'm just saying, in the first place, all the state

So far isn't — that doesn't violate the Sherman

MR. WEICKHARDT;

9
10

would be innocuous if it were not that the statute -QUESTION;

11

12

He designates one and he refuses to

designate anybody else.
MR. WEICKHARDT;

13
14

Just that agreement itself

Yes.

Now, that agreement

alone would be innocuous but -QUESTION;

15

Agreement?

There's no agreement.

16

There’s just that he designates one and refuses to

17

designate others.

That's not an agreement.

MR. WEICKHARDT;

18

Well, I assume that he’s not

19

designating someone who is unwilling to serve as an

20

importer.

21

QUESTION;

Ch, sure.

22

MR. WEICKHARDT;

23

QUESTION;

I think the Court —

He serves as an importer.

But

24

there’s no agreement between the two that he won't

25

designate anybody else.

He just doesn’t designate

29

anybody else
MR. WEICKHARDTi

2

Yes, but the statute here

3

gives the agreement to designate that effect.

4

agrees —
QUESTION;

5

If he

I know, but the state law just

6

comes along and says, anybody who isn’t designated as an

7

importer by the distiller may not import that brand.

8

That's what it says.

9

liquor control people suddenly find somebody who isn’t

That’s all it says.

And the state

10

designated importing that brand, and they prosecute

11

him .

12

Now, is that a violation of the Sherman Act?

13

MR. WEICKHARDT;

14
15

I believe the violation here

is the exclusion of someone —
QUESTION;

The importer — the distiller

16

doesn’t do anything but designate one licensee in the

17

whole state.

18

That's all he does.

MR. WEICKHARDT;

Well, the result of that

19

conduct under the statute is that people who can get

20

these goods elsewhere free of restriction are thereby

21

prohibited.

22

QUESTION;

That's the statute that does that.

23

MR. WEICKHARDT;

Well, I don’t think you can

24

say that the statute does the restriction, because the

25

statute is not self-actuating.

Basically what happens

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

under the statute is that only those importers who are

2

authorized by the distiller may import.

3

substantially different from a statute that would say

4

that he can agree to import some and prohibit others

5

from importing.
QUESTION:

6

It's not

What if the distiller found that a

7

non-designated wholesaler was in fact getting a-hcld of

8

some of the distiller's products from another wholesaler

9

out of state, and the distiller simply sued the

10

out-of-state wholesaler for a breach of a private

11

agreement between them that the out-of-state wholesaler

12

wouldn't sell to people in California.

13

violation?

14

would that be a violation of the antitrust laws?

15

Would that be a

Simply a state court action on contract;

Well, certainly the question

16

demonstrates that the distiller can — does have a

17

remedy for that particular problem.

18

franchisees is selling to a non-designated wholesaler,

19

he's certainly free under the Sylvania case to refuse to

20

deal with that franchise wholesaler further.

21

remedy there.

22

QUESTION:

If one of his

He has a

That wouldn't violate the antitrust

23

laws.

Why does the state statute that simply really

24

authorizes that sort of a thing and says, you won't be

25

prosecuted under state law, it's no violation of state

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

law to do this, why is that any different?
MR. WEICKHARDTi

2

The difference is that this

3

state statute essentially delegates the power to decide

4

who can import to private parties without supervision.
QUESTION;

5

They could easily have -- they

6

probably did have that power without the statute, didn't

7

they ?
MR. WEICKHARDTi

8

9

Yes, but they did without —

they could not without this statute keep out goods that

10

they let out of their franchise system.

You see, the

11

problem here is that the distillers are voluntarily

12

selling goods outside their franchise system without any

3

territorial restrictions.

And what they're saying under

4

this statute is, I want a second bite at the apple to

5

stop these goods from coming into California.
Now, they don't need that because they can

6
7

impose those restrictions by private contractual means,

8

Sylvania restrictions, in the original deals that they

9

make with the wholesalers that they sell to throughout

20

the United States.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. WEICKHARDT;

23

But they can't in Oklahoma.
They can in Oklahoma now-,

because —

24

QUESTION;

25

MR.

Well, now, but they couldn't --

WEICKHARDT;

— since the Central Liquor

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decision, which was decided after this case was taken,

2

it is legal for distillers to impose Sylvania

3

restrictions in Oklahoma.

4

case was decided, most distillers have imposed those

5

restrictions.

6

right to do so under Oklahoma law.

Now, since the Central Liquor

Some have not, even though they have the

But if they have not imposed those

7

8

restrictions, they are voluntarily and with full

9

knowledge and consent selling those goods to an Oklahoma

10

jobber with knowledge that they will be exported to

11

California.
QUESTION;

12

You want to say that these

13

distillers -- the distiller by designating one importer

14

in California is violating the antitrust law because the

15

state has passed a statute.
HR. WEICKHARDT*

16

Well, what I’m saying is that

17

what the statute does is it gives that designation the

18

effect, tha lagal effect of excluding everybody else,

19

including people who could operate in a free market.
QUESTION;

20

Why do you hang that on the — why

21

do you blame the distillers for that law?

22

doing is what otherwise would be legal, designating one

23

importer.

24

MR. WEICKHARDT;

25

QUESTION:

All they’re

It would otherwise --

The state comes along and says, no

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

one else may import.
MB. WEICKHARDT;

2

It would otherwise be legal.

3

Without this statute, of course, people who existed in

4

the free market such as the Respondents could continue

5

to trade.

6

agree to designate that one wholesaler, then everyone

7

else is excluded.
It gives -- the statute gives exclusionary

8

9
10

But what the statute does is say, if you

effect to that designation and thereby excludes people
who would be operating in a free market.

11

Now, the -- it's been argued here that there

12

is essentially only a unilateral act by the distiller,

3

that the designation process is not an agreement or

4

conspiracy.

5

more than a unilateral action, because to make the

6

restrictive scheme work the distiller has to agree to

7

authorize his franchisees to import.

8

agreement is an essential part of the restrictive scheme

9

here.

But the operation of the restraint requires

QUESTION;

20

So the designation

How do we know that without any

21

record, when the statute's simply being challenged on

22

its face?

23

MR. WEICKHARDT;

Well, I think, as I said

24

earlier, I think it's safe to presume that the distiller

25

is not going to designate people who are unwilling to

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sell his product.

He's certainly going to designate

2

people that he thinks are willing to promote the

3

product, willing to serve as his wholesalers in the

4

state .
Now, I think the argument that there is not a

5
6

per se violation here has largely hinged on the

7

contention that this statute somehow facilitates

8

Sylvania type restrictions and it therefore has

9

pro-competitive benefits.

Now, there's no basis for

10

saying this as to the California-Oklahoma trade after

11

the Central Liquor case.

12

The Central Liquor case says that -- decided

13

by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in February of this year

14

— says that the distiller may refuse to sell in

15

Oklahoma to a jobber if the goods are destined for out

So after the Central Liquor case, the liquor

2

industry is like any other industry.

Sylvania

3

restrictions may be imposed by private contractual

4

devices, and no statutory enabling act is necessary to

5

do that.
The issue here, therefore, is not whether the

6
7

statute is necessary to facilitate Sylvania , but it is

8

whether once having sold the good without restriction in

9

Olkahoma or elsewhere, the distiller may reassert

10

control over the goods in the hands of a subsequent

11

purchaser who purchased them without restriction.

12

at this point the distiller has transferred all property

13

and contractual rights in the goods, and the subsequent

14

purchaser has full title to the goods and has obtained

15

them without restriction.

16

distiller, although he could have originally imposed

17

these restrictions in Oklahoma and didn’t, wants a

18

second bite at the apple.

19

to effectuate any vertical restrictions on distribution.

And

And nonetheless, the

And it's just not necessary

Now, theoretically there is no difference,

20
21

because the Respondents purchased these goods without

22

restriction, there's no difference between these goods,

23

between the distiller restricting trade in these goods

24

and goods which were manufactured by some other

25

distiller.

In fact, if this Court accepts a

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

restriction, a reassertion of control over goods that

2

were originally sold without restriction, there is

3

nothing to prevent the distiller from reasserting

4

control, even when the goods are in the hands of a

5

consumer.

6

Now, you might say that the Respondents here

7

are like the consumer in the Sylvania case.

Sylvania

8

put restrictions on Continental T.V., and that was all

9

right, but when Continental T.V. sold the television to

10

the consumer, it sold the television — it sells the

11

television without restriction, and there's nothing in

12

Sylvania that says, that keeps that consumer now from

13

taking that television to Nevada and selling it to

14

somebody else.

15

there’s no argument for the reassertion of such control

16

by the manufacturer.

17

If you get it without restriction,

And this statute, the state court

2

found in its opinion, is counterproductive to the

purposes of the three-tier system because it authorizes

the distillers to exert more control over the

6

One other thing --

7

QUESTIONS

Well, that's the statutory purpose,

8

isn't it?

The statutory purpose is to enable the

9

distiller to control the vertical line of distribution

10

of his own product more effectively than he could do by

11

private contract.
MR. WEICKHARDT:

12

Well he doesn't need it, he

13

doesn *t need it to control the distribution of his own

14

product because he can do that by private contractual

15

means under the Sylvania decision.

16

Well, I say he apparently can do it

17

more effectively with the state behind him than he can

do it by just private agreement.

or not.

statute serves some of these grand promotion purposes

2

which the Petitioners argue, they say that the statute

3

will guarantee higher prices in California and thereby

4

allow the franchise wholesalers to advertise the brands

5

more, and that will strengthen interbrand

6

competition —

7

QUESTION

It serves precisely the same

8

purpose as a resale price maintenance scheme serves,

9

effectively, too.

I think that's the purpose that the

10

distillers would attempt to serve with the statute.

11

They would attempt to eliminate the discountes.

12

probably why the statute was passed in the first place,

13

because it's clear that the Respondents were the

14

discounters in the market, and they sell this liguor —

15

the difference at the retail level is about a dollar a

16

bottle, and that liquor would stay out, and there

17

wouldn’t be any price — there would be much less price

18

competition if this statute were in force.

19

^hat's

But I wanted to say, Mr. Justice Stevens, that

20

even if we concede that the statute has all of these

grand promotional purposes, that it will help the

distillers to finance more advertising in California,

the State of California has absolutely no regulatory

interest in that.

We think the statute falls clearly within the

18

area indicated in Mr. Justice Powell’s decision in

19

Midcal of a statute that regulates both importation and

20

the structure of the industry, and therefore, that you

21

don't get to a weighing test in a 21st Amendment

22

analysis of this statute.

23

But if you do, let me make the suggestion that

24

the court below did the weighing in this fashion.

On

25

the one hand, on the federal side, the Court put the

entire weight of the majesty of the Sherman Act as a

charter of economic freedom, and on the other hand put a

3

modestly weighted amount of state interest.

really, I think, is not what one does or ought to do and

5

what this Court ought to do in the weighing analysis if

6

you get to it.

That

What you have to do is compare the impairment

8

of the federal Sherman Act interest on the one hand with

9

whatever state values are served on the other.

And in

10

this kind of a statute where we are dealing with a

11

statute that give some collateral support to vertical

12

allocation which has been held in GTE Sylvania not to

13

violate the Sherman Act, we are obviously not dealing

14

with a heavy impairment of any Sherman Act interest.

15

there is an interest to be put on the federal side, it

16

is a relatively light one.

17

seems to me, that must be made, not put the whole

18

Sherman Act on one side and state interest on the other,

19

but how much does it impair any Sherman Act values here,

20

and how many state interests are served there.

21

If

And that is the analysis, it

Both questions are federal questions.

Both

22

questions are for this Court to resolve, and they should

23

be resolved, we think, by adjusting the balance in favor

24

of the statute if you get to the weighing analysis.

25

Thank you.
