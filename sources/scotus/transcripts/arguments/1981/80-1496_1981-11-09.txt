ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE R. BOEHM, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. BOEHM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

14 the Court, this case raises the question whether the Indiana
15 judgments relating to the rehabilitation of UNAC, as the
16 insurance company involved in this case is colloquially
17 called, are entitled to full faith and credit in North
18 Carolina as a result of the procedures that were
19 implemented .
20

There are two judgments of the Indiana Court that

21 UNAC submits are entitled to full faith and credit, and
22 preclude relitigation of the issues that the Respondents
23 seek to raise.
24

The history of this proceeding started in 1974,

25 when the Indiana Department of Insurance, pursuant to a

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C 20024 1202^ 554-2345

1 statutory mandate to take over the operations of a failing
2 insurance company organized under Indiana law, did just
3 that.

As a result, pursuant to the Indiana statute, the

4 Indiana Insurance Commissioner, as rehabilitator, became in
5 possession of the business and assets of UNAC.

That is the

6 statutory language.
7
8 the Court.

Subsequent to that time, a notice was sent out by
The first notice that went out in 1975 was a

9 Buie 23(B)(3) notice with which this Court is fully
10 familiar, because Indiana trial procedure is exactly the
11 same as federal trial procedure in this respect, and just
12 about exactly at the same time that the Indiana Commissioner
13 took over UNAC, UNAC was sued in two class actions, one in
14 state court in Illinois and one in federal court in
15 Virginia.
16

The state court in Illinois case was removed to

17 federal court in Illinois, and each case was then stayed
18 pursuant initially to an injunction issued by the Indiana
19 court and then ultimately by agreement.

The class

20 plaintiffs in those two lawsuits then intervened in the
21 Indiana proceeding, and those class plaintiffs were
22 ultimately certified as class plaintiffs on behalf of all
23 policyholders.
24

The claims they were asserting were essentially

25 that UNAC had defrauded the policyholders into entering into

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the policyholder relationship.

So, the first thing that

2 went out was a Rule 23(B)(3) notice with respect to those
3 claims.

It also explicitly told the policyholders that

4 whether or not you opt out of the class pursuant to Rule
5 23(B)(3), you may ultimately be bound by a plan of
6 rehabilitation in your capacity as a policyholder.

We don't

7 know at this time whether there will be a plan of
8 rehabilitation, but if there is one, you are in court in
9 Indiana in your policyholder capacity, irrespective of
10 whether you want these plaintiffs to represent you in
11 prosecuting these fraud claims.

So, there are two

12 jurisdictional hooks, if you will, operating on this
13 situtaion.
14

No North Carolina policyholder opted out.

As a

15 result, all of the North Carolina policyholders were in
'16 court in Indiana, both as class plaintiffs and as
17 policyholders.
18

QUESTION*

If one had opted out, would we have a

19 different situation?
20

MR. BOEHM*

Well, we would have a different

21 situation with respect to one issue, but not as to the
22 fundamental issue that UNAC relies on, which is that qua
23 policyholders, the policyholders are bound by the plan of
24 rehabilitation, which is entitled to full faith and credit
25 in all states once entered as a judicial decree.

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 f202) 554-2345

1

There is a second, if you will, fail-back position

2 that UNAC has that they are also bound as non-opting out
3 plaintiffs by a settlement of their class claims as well,
4 but that raises another whole complex of issues as to the
5 nature of a multi-state Rule 23(B)(3) claim, and how the
6 plaintiffs relate to the state of jurisdiction.
7

There are cases that hold, and they are cited in

8 our brief — the Kansas Supreme Court Shutts case is the
9 leading one, that holds that a plaintiff who is a member of
10 a class is in court and can be bound even though he is not a
11 resident of the state and has no other jurisdictional
12 connection with the state, but that issue is only reached in
13 this case if you should hold, which we submit would be
14 incorrect, that UNAC's plan of rehabilitation cannot bind
15 the policyholders as such.
16

QUESTION:

Hr. Boehm, in one of the two Indiana

17 actions, some of the North Carolina parties' action
18 intervened, did they not?
19

MR. BOEHM:

Yes, sir.

20 narrative, that happened.

At that point in my

The North Carolina Guaranty

21 Association intervened at the point after the class was
22 certified, and after the time for opting out had expired,
23 but before any

24

plan of rehabilitation had been implemented.

The North Carolina Guaranty Association, as you

25 know, is here in its capacity as assignee of the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 policyholders* claims by operation of the North Carolina
2 statutory framework., which makes them liable to make good on
3 the policyholders but also gives them whatever rights it
4 gives the company.
5

QUESTION;

Mr. Boehm, is that the group that has

6 an appeal pending in the Indiana courts?
7

HR. BOEHM;

8

QUESTION:

Yes.
From which of the judgments, the

9 rehabilitation —

16

MR. BOEHM;

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BOEHM;

The second.
The second?
The second.
And that is the basic one, is it?
That is really the supplemental.
Supplemental.
Yes, sir.
What is the status of that appeal now?
It is pending.

Oral argument was held

19a few months ago, and the court took it under submission and
20 indicated

that it would stay proceedings pending a

21 resolution of this Court's proceeding.
22

QUESTION;

23

HR. BOEHM:

Until this Court decides.
They are waiting for you, is what it

24 boils down to.
25

QUESTION:

But there was never any appeal from the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 1976
2

HR. BOEHM*

That is correct, and that is the key

3 point, or a key point.

That 1976 judgment that implemented

4 the plan of rehabilitation is binding, and the time for
5 appeal has run, and it is entitled to full faith and credit.
6

Now, when the North Carolina Guaranty Association,

7 subsequent to the plan's implementation, and subsequent to
8 its becoming a binding final judgment, instituted a lawsuit
9 in North Carolina.

At that point, UNAC went back into court

10 under the continuing jurisdiction provisions of the
11 rehabilitation decree and said essentially, court, what do
12 we do?

We have been sued in North Carolina, we think we

13 shouldn't be continuing to honor the service agreement that
14 we've got with the Guaranty Association, if they are
15 claiming they are entitled to something beyond what they get
16 under the rehabilitation plan.
17
18 which

The Indiana court then held another hearing at
the North Carolina Guaranty Association appeared and

19 argued and was heard and presented its arguments.
20 Essentially, the issue presented by that hearing was, is the
21 first judgment conclusive, and the Indiana court said, yes,
22 I decided this once before, and I am deciding it again, and
23 I had jurisdiction then and I have it now, and that is the
24 end of the matter.
25

Now, that is what is on appeal, that second order.

1

QUESTIONS

Mr. Boehm, did that occur after the

2 proceeding in North Carolina?
3

MR. BOEHM*

It occurred before any judgment was

4 entered in North Carolina.

It was after the complaint was

5 filed and before any judgment or summary judgment motion was
6 entered.
7

QUESTION*

8

MR. BOEHM:

9

QUESTION*

So which takes precedence —
The Indiana court.
-- on the litigation of the

10 jurisdictional question?
11

MR. BOEHM*

The Indiana court clearly under

12 settled rules of res judicata.

The first judgment wins, I

13 think, under settled rules of both Indiana and federal
14 procedure.
15

QUESTION*

Is it your position that the question

16 of subject matter jurisdiction was fully litigated in the
17 Indiana court?
18

MR. BOEHM*

Yes, although I am frank to say,

19 Justice O'Connor, I don't know what subject matter
20 jurisdiction means in this context.

Subject matter

21 jurisdiction in the federal context means, is there a
22 federal question, is there diversity.

In the state context,

23 we had a court here of general jurisdiction in Indiana,

and

24 it had jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute, any dispute
25 that is cognizable by an Indiana court, and this is one of

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON D C. 20024 <202^ E54-234S

1 them.

The only question is, did it have personal

2 jurisdiction, we submit, over the parties, and it clearly
3 did as to the North Carolina Guaranty Association.
4

QUESTIONS

Mr. Boehm, does the Indiana statutory

5 scheme provide for judicial review of the administrative
6 proceedings leading to rehabilitation?
7

MR. BOEHM i

Oh, yes.

Indeed, it is a judicial

8 decree, Your Honor.

All the —

9

Yes.

QUESTION:

The ultimate rehabilitation

10 decree is a judicial decree.
11

MR. BOEHM:

Yes, sir, it is a judgment of a court

12 of general jurisdiction.

Indeed, all the administrative

13 proceeding is, it is not an administrative proceeding at
14 all.

The administrator is a party to the proceeding, and he

15 proposes a plan of rehabilitation.

You then send out a

16 notice to everybody in the world who might be affected by
17 it, which included, by the way, the state insurance
18 commissioners of all 50 states as well as policyholders,
19 creditors, agents, all manner of people.
20

You then hold a hearing at which everybody —

21

QUESTION:

Including the custodian of this North

22 Carolina fund?
23

MR. BOEHM:

Well, it is argued that the

24 Commissioner of Insurance is the custodian.

Now, apparently

25 under Indiana — under North Carolina law the deposit is

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 made with the Insurance Commissioner, who then registers it
2 in the name of the treasurer, but it is the Insurance
3 Commissioner who receives the deposit and to whom UNAC gave
4 it.

Now, if he turned around and holds it in street name,

5 if you will, that is his business, is our view.

It is the

6 Insurance Commissioner who is the arm of the state of North
7 Carolina that is involved here, and he was given notice.
8

QUESTION;

Is this not in effect a streamlined

9 statutory receivership, much like an old-fashioned
10 receivership?
11

MR. BOEHM;

Yes, sir, that is exactly what it is,

121 think, in common sense terms.
13

QUESTION;

It merely is tailored to fit the

14 particular industry here.
15

MR. BOEHM;

That is right, and the reason, of

16 course, that you have a statutory proceeding is that the
17 bankruptcy laws don't apply to insurance.

Otherwise, you

18 really wouldn't need this -- this relatively unusual state
19 law creature.
20

QUESTION;

Did the Insurance Commissioner of North

21 Carolina take any part in the Indiana case?
22

MR. BOEHM:

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. BOEHM:

25

QUESTION;

No.
You said he did receive notice.
Yes .

3

QUESTION;

That’s correct.
And both of those officers are parties

6

MR. BOEHM;

That's correct.

7 defendant, by the way.

They are parties

The plaintiffs sued them along with

8 UNAC for whatever interest they may have.

They then filed a

9 cross claim that in effect asked for no relief.

It is our

10 view that they are nominal parties at best.
11

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Boehm, I gather, of course,

12 the Indiana court took the position that this fund, whatever
13 you want to call it, the deposit was before it.
14

MR. BOEHM;

15

QUESTION;

Right.

16

QUESTION;

Justice Brennan, what was before it was

Not exactly, sir.

17 the beneficial interest of UNAC in the fund.

In other

18 words, this — the Indiana courts did not adjudicate the
19 trust, if you want to use the parlance of the North Carolina
20 parties, was invalid.

It adjudicated, to use the trust

21 analogy, that the beneficiaries had assigned their interest
22 to UNAC in exchange for ongoing insurance.
23

QUESTION;

And is that the holding of the Indiana

24 rehabilitation court?
25

MR. BOEHM;

I think that is a fair

1 characterization of it in those terms.
2

QUESTION*

How did it say the deposit or the

3 interest in the deposit got before it?
4

ME. BOEHM*

It said that all parties before it are

5 before -- the policyholders are before it, and that whatever
6 claims they have against any asset of UNAC,

which includes

7 UNAC's beneficial interest in the trust, are hereby
8 compromised and dismissed.
9

QUESTION:

Has that resisted?

Was that issue

10 contested in the Indiana court?
11

MR. BOEHM: No.

12

QUESTION*

Of course, as you said, the North

13 Carolina authorities never appeared.
14

MR. BOEHM*

Well, the policyholders appeared and

15 the North Carolina Guaranty Association appeared, and the
16 Commissioner —

20 interest belonged -21

MR. BOEHM*

There was no argument about that

22 deposit or any deposit in any other state.

The only issue

23 about deposits that caused problems were those outside the
24 United States, where there was a real question,

and the plan

25 explicitly dealt with the problem that we don't have a full

I know, that is your fail-back position
No, no, that is not our fail-back

22 position, if I may respectfully —

QUESTION:

Well, you say you were there only

24 because they were parties to a class action.

25

No, that’s the fail-back position.

2 company, and if no policyholder had intervened, we still
3 could have had a valid rehabilitation, simply by sending
4 them notice.

Well, you ought to be glad you don't

6 have to argue that.

QUESTION*

Well —
Because you certainly can argue that

Sure.

We've got three, really.

Does that position depend on North

17

MR. BOEHM*

18

QUESTION*

No.

No, it depends on Indiana law.

Indiana decides as to who has

19 possession of that money in North Carolina?

MR. BOEHM*

21

QUESTION*

22

MR. BOEHM*

No, sir.

Indiana decides --

Well, that is what I am talking about.
Indiana does not decide that it had

23 that pot, nor did Indiana decide that if the North Carolina
24 policyholder had wished to assert a claim against that pot
25 in North Carolina it couldn *t have done so.

They could hav

MR. EOEHM*

— because the Indiana court

2 adjudicated all that and it is res judicata.
3

QUESTION*

May I ask, Mr. Boehm, I gather — or is

4 it your position that because you had those — or Indiana
5 courts, rather, had the Guaranty Association before it, it
6 had that jurisdiction.

Even if it had no jurisdiction over

7 the fund itself, nevertheless the Indiana court may enforce
8 its order requiring that the fund be part of the assets.

Is

9 that it?
10

MR. BOEHM*

Yes, sir.

That is a position.

11 is actually another fall-back position.

That

The basic position

12 is that a rehabilitation works even if nobody appears in
13 Indiana court, that all you need to do to adjust the rights
14 of the Indiana policyholders and all policyholders in the
15 United States is send them a notice and say, .here is our
16 plan of reorganization, just like a bankruptcy court does,
17 and to the extent that you are a policyholder of this
18 company,

unless you appear and object, your rights are going

19 to be adjusted by this plan,

and if you can't do that, you

20 can*t rehabilitate an insurance company.
21

QUESTION*

Do you think you have some old

22 receivership cases that said that the receivership court
23 could adjudicate the claims to assets outside the state if
24 no one who has — who had any claim to those assets appeared
25 in the receivership court?

QUESTION;

Well, I -That this rehabilitation proceeding

4 could adjudicate claims to property in North Carolina even
5 though the people who also had claims to that property never
6 appeared in the receivership proceeding?

That seems to be

7 your basic position.
8

MR. BOEHM;

9

QUESTION;

I am not sure.
And yet — I don't know.

Must you win

10 on this ground?
11

MR. BOEHM;

No.

No, we can win on the ground that

12 Justice Brennan articulated, and that —
13

QUESTION;

Well, then you can win on the ground

14 that the policyholders are there through the association.
15

MR. BOEHM;

Sure. That only works for North

16 Carolina .
17

And that they — and that they had a

2

MR. BOEHM;

3

QUESTION;

Absolutely.
Well, yes,

that is if it is bound by

4 the jurisdictional holding, but who is bound by a
5 jurisdictional determination if he hasn't had a chance to
6 litigate it?
7

MR. BOEHM;

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. BOEHM;

Well, Your Honor -And who litigated it in Indiana?
The North Carolina Guaranty

10 Association did, the second time.
11

QUESTION;

12

MR. BOEHM;

13

QUESTION;

Right.
The first time —
There is it, and there are the

14 shareholders, the policyholders, and they are there
15 litigating jurisdiction, or at least they had a chance to.
16

MR. BOEHM;

I don't disagree for a moment that

17 that is dispositive of this case, but there is another, more
18 fundamental point.
19

QUESTION;

If the question of jurisdiction had

20 never come up in the Indiana court and the policyholders
21 weren't there, they had never had a chance to litigate it
22 except from way back, in North Carolina, just the recitation
23 of having jurisdiction would be —

No, but the policyholders —

All right.

I know that.

I want you to assume that

No, but I am saying, they were there

They were there at

There is

But not with respect to their claims

QUESTION;

They took on --

Well, I don't think you can have it

Either they were there through the Association

21 or they weren't.

MR. BOEHM;

Well, they were there through the

In other

25 words, they were there in three capacities, in our

8

QUESTION*

What would be the situation if this

There would be no question that a

That would be, of course, as a matter of

Now, I am not a bankruptcy expert, but I am

14 quite confident that is correct, that a reorganization under
15 the bankruptcy laws works nationwide*
16

QUESTION*

Mr. Boehm, let's assume for the moment

17 that there was a creditor in North Carolina, your insurance
18 company, and that that creditor had, let's say had a
19 mortgage on North Carolina property or he had a North
20 Carolina judgment that gave him a lien on North Carolina
21 property.

Is it your position that the Indiana court,

22 without the presence of either the rece or the creditor
23 could have wiped it out or adjusted it, taken the property
24 away and given him a general claim?
25

QUESTION:

Just by sending him notice and say,

2

MR. BOEHM:

I think ultimately that would be our

3 position, yes, that that is what it means to say that the
4 Indiana statute has — that the Indiana commissioner assumes
5 title to whatever beneficial interest the company has.
6

QUESTION:

Do you think an old-fashioned receiver

7 could do that?
8

MR. BOEHM:

No, I think that the Indiana statute

9 gives the insurance rehabilitator, because of the unique
10 nature of insurance, that power.

In that sense, the

11 receivership analogy breaks down, I think.
12

QUESTION;

Yes.

That is where it — the Indiana
i

13 law can take away the rights of the North Carolina
14 policyholders.

MR. BOEHM;

MR. BOEHM:

You see, that is my problem.
That is the deal the policyholder

QUESTION:

He shouldn't buy insurance in an out of

20 state company if he doesn't want to take that risk.

Is that

21 your position?
22

MR. BOEHM;

That is exactly what it amounts to.

23 And indeed, consider what the situation is if that is not
24 the law, if

we can't bind all creditors everywhere.

How do

25 you rehabilitate an insurance company.

Oh, it does.

It does.

And if a North

QUESTION*

Mr. Boehm, do you make anything of

7 McCarren-Ferguson in respect of the authority of the Indiana
8 Insurance Commissioner?
9

MR. BOEHM*

The only point we make of

10 McCarren-Ferguson is that it evidences a Congressional
11 policy to support state regulatory schemes, and to that
12 extent it supports the notion that the Indiana Commissioner
13 can do exactly —
14

QUESTION*

That still doesn’t eliminate the full

15 faith and credit federal constitutional question we have
16 here .
17

MR. BOEHM*

It does not, I don’t believe, although

18 it could be viewed as a Congressional policy in part
19 implementing the delegation of Congress to legislate under

20 full faith and credit to support these state schemes, and
21 indeed, what the Indiana Commissioner did here is what every
22 rehabilitater does in every multi-state rehabilitation, and
23 there is no

alternative.

24 things, where are we?

If they cannot adjust all these

HR. BOEHH:

There is no federal tribunal, and

2 there is only one state that seeks to do this.

This is

3 completely unlike the Delaware Stott sequestration
4 situation, where the jurisdiction that is asserted is
5 different from the claim that is being adjusted.

Here, the only jurisdiction that is being asserted

Now, just exactly what does it get?

4 Does that help it pay premiums, or help it pay claims?
5

HR. BOEHM*

It just gets the money, and it puts it

6 in its general asset, and it is that much richer, so that it
7 can -- I mean, it is going to pay the claims whether or not
8 it gets the money from us.

It is solvent.

It is an

10 insurance companies that do business in North Carolina.

And it does business in states other

12 than North Carolina?

HR. BOEHM:

No.

QUESTION:

What obligation do they have that they did not

4

ME. BOEHM:

They have to make up the difference

5 between what the policyholders will get under the
6 restructured policy and what they had under the original
7 policy as written.

In other words, essentially what caused

8 the rehabilitation to take place was, the company was
9 writing Cadillac policies at Volkswagen prices.

The

10 Guaranty Association has to now deliver that Cadillac, and
11 gets the Volkswagen income, if that is —
12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BOEHM:

14

QUESTION;

They are basically a reinsurer.
It puts them in that posture, yes.
Mr. Boehm, before the Guaranty Fund was

15 created, the policyholders would have had a very serious
16 interest in the outcome of this case, wouldn't they?
17

MR. BOEHM:

Yes.

Well, assuming they — yes, and

18 they could have then elected to assert a claim against the
19 deposit.

Now, there is one point that needs to be made.

20 They have no practical need -- I mean, this is a little
21 deposit.

It is a $>100,000 face bond.

It may be $50,000.

22 One judgment that the Indiana Commissioner had to make was,

24 mini-liquidations going around all over the nation over
25 essentially immaterial amounts of money?

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. PATTERSON*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, as a condition to its doing business in

17

North Carolina, UNAC agreed to transfer title to securities

18

to a trust located in North Carolina, and subject to North

19

Carolina trustees.

20

this trustee, of this trust would be for the protection of

21

North Carolina policyholders in the event that UNAC should

UNAC agreed that the sole purpose of

22 default on any of its obligations, whether by reason of
23
24
25

insolvency or otherwise.
UNAC subsequently became insolvent.

The final

order of rehabilitation in the Indiana court allowed UNAC to

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 substantially diminish its policy obligations owed to
2 policyholders in return for UNAC being allowed to continue
3 to do business.
4

During the entire pendency of the rehabilitation

5 proceeding, there was not one single notice to the
6 policyholders of the existence of this deposit or their
7 special statutory rights in the deposit.

UNAC -- or the

8 rehabilitation proceeding in Indiana was conducted as if the
9 deposit did not exist.

No one, least of all the

10 policyholders, had any idea that UNAC was -- or that the
11 rehabilitation proceeding was attempting to assert
12 jurisdiction over this deposit.
13

QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, your client knew about

14 it, didn *t it?
15

MR. PATTERSON:

Our client was aware of the

16 deposit, Justice Stevens, but it had absolutely no reason to
17 believe that UNAC was attempting to assert jurisdiction over
18 it.
19

This was —
QUESTION:

Didn't they schedule it as an asset in

20 their balance sheet, whatever it was?
21

MR. PATTERSON:

The deposit was scheduled, and I

22 think this is discussed at some length in the briefs,
23 because of this discrepancy, the deposit was listed in the

24 balance sheet of the convention blanks that UNAC filed with
25 the North Carolina Department of Insurance and with the

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON D C 90094 (909^ R54-934S

1 other Departments of Insurance.

However» the deposit in

2 that convention blank was listed as a general asset of the
3 insolvent insurer, which is patently incorrect.

I don't

4 think UNAC would object to that description of the listing
5 as being — as being just as incorrect as it could possibly
6 be.
7

If one were to look at this convention blank, the

8 only assumption that he could draw is that this was a
9 general asset of the insolvent insurer, which is just not
10 the truth.

It was a -- not only was it not a general asset,

11 it was an asset to which UNAC did not even hold title.
12 had been transferred to a trust.

It

The terms of the trust are

13 the terms of the Uniform Insurance Liquidation Act in North
14 Carolina.

They quite explicitly say that in the event that

15 there is a default, the deposit will be used for the benefit
16 of the North Carolina policyholders.
17

QUESTIONi

Mr. Patterson, is it your position that

18 the proposed final plan for rehabilitation and the first
19 final judgment did not in any way indicate to the North
20 Carolina Guaranty Association that UNAC was assuming and the
21 Indiana court was assuming that it had control in effect
22 over that deposit?
23

MR. PATTERSON:

That is correct. Justice O'Connor,

24 and it is consistent with — with the many cases at the
25 state court level that have been decided with regard to

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
4(10 VIRGINIA AVF

SW

WASHINGTON n O

IO(Y>\ SSA-QrUS

1 deposits.

Indeed, there are two cases in North Carolina,

2 one a federal court case interpreting North Carolina law,
3 and the second a very recent North Carolina Supreme Court
4 case that specifically says that these deposits are a trust,
5 and they are not an asset of the insolvent insurer, and they
6 are not subject to the jurisdiction of the domiciliary
7 insolvency proceeding.
8

So, consistent with North Carolina law, the

9 Guaranty Association certainly had no basis on which to
10 conclude that UNAC was going to assert jurisdiction in this
11 deposit.
12

QUESTION;

But North Carolina can't determine for

13 itself, can it, whether or not Indiana has jurisdiction over
14 a particular rece or a particular set of facts, or a
15 particular case?

That remains for the Fourteenth Amendment

16 and the International Shoe and that type of case?
17
18 Rehnquist.

MR. PATTERSON:

That’s correct, Justice

It can't determine for itself, but I think under

19 Durfee v. Duke, it is certainly entitled to determine
20 whether jurisdiction was fully and fairly considered in the
21 proceeding in the other state, which is exactly what
22 happened in the subsequent North Carolina proceeding.
23 court looked at the

Indiana proceeding.

24 absolutely no mention of the deposit.

The

There was
There was no notice

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

SW

WASHINGTON GO 90094 f9091 5S4-934S

1 rights in it.
2

The court looked to the entire record and saw

3 absolutely no mention of this deposit within the insolvency
4 proceeding.

Indeed, the closest mention of any -- of the

5 interplay of an insolvency proceeding with this sort of
6 deposit occurs in the brief that UNAC's current counsel
7 submitted to the rehabilitation court in support of
8 rehabilitation.
9

In that brief, counsel quotes from Couch on

10 Insurance, a very well recognized treatise that acknowledges
11 -- a passage that acknowledges that a rehabilitation
12 proceeding does not have priority over -- or does not have
13 control over assets in another jurisdiction when there are
14 special statutes in that jurisdiction pertaining to this
15 asset.
16

QUESTION;

But isn't at least the second Indiana

17 judgment, remaining unreversed as it is, an official act or
18 entry subject to the full faith and credit clause even
19 though it may not be final in Indiana?
20

NR. PATTERSON:

Well, Justice Rehnguist, that

21 proposition is a little bit hard to swallow if you look at
22 it from the North Carolina side.

North Carolina first

23 challenges the jurisdiction of Indiana to determine the
24 right of the proceeding.

The Guaranty Association initiated

25 a proceeding in North Carolina saying that the Indiana

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 proceeding lacked jurisdiction over the deposit.
2 right.

All

Under, I think, the cases that this Court has handed

3 down dealing with collateral attack, it is fairly obvious
4 that a court can come up with the wrong conclusion as to
5 jurisdiction, but if it appears that jurisdiction was fully
6 and fairly considered, it can't be attacked.
7

All right.

Now, what we have here is a situation

8 where the Court didn't come up with any conclusion, didn't
9 fully and fairly consider jurisdiction as to the deposit at
10 all in its first proceeding.

Then, when it is about — when

11 a proceeding is filed in another state, starting a
12 collateral attack as to jurisdiction, and one, I think, that
13 UNAC could truly lose, UNAC initiates another proceeding in
14 Indiana and says, all right, we missed — we neglected to
15 fully and fairly consider jurisdiction in the original
16 proceeding, but we will fully and fairly consider it now,
17 and that will relate back to the rehabilitation proceeding.
18 In

19

other words, the —
QUESTION:

Isn't the assumption that a judicial

20 decree of any state or federal court presumptively had
21 jurisdiction, and it is up to the person attacking it to
22 show that it did not have jurisdiction?

23

NR. PATTERSON:

That is correct, and I think that

24 is exactly what happened in North Carolina when the
25 rehabilitation proceeding was collaterally attacked in North

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 Carolina.

It was very clear that the Indiana proceedings

2 seemed to have swept this asset in by mistake, as much as
3 anything.

It was just totally unaware of the nature of the

4 asset, of the fact that it was subject to statutes in North
5 Carolina.
6

What UNAC seems to be arguing is almost — could

7 best be termed jurisdiction by mistake rather than
8 jurisdiction by necessity or anything else.

We just think

9 jurisdiction would not lie in this situation, and the North
10 Carolina court is free to conclude that, after looking at
11 the record and determining whether jurisdiction had been
12 fully and fairly considered.
13

QUESTION;

Well, I gather, Hr. Patterson, that is

14 that the nature of this trust was such that that deposit
15 could never be an asset of UNAC in the rehabilitation
16 proceeding unless what?
17

1

QUESTION;

And the Association accepted a plan

2 which defined fully the extent of its interests.
3

MR. PATTERSON;

Yes, but if you will look at the

4 definition of the Guaranty Association’s interest in that
5 plan, the definition of the Guaranty Association's interest
6 is that it has the — it has the same rights that the
7 policyholders that it made whole would have.

So, by virtue

8 of subrogation, it stands on —
9

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but they — suppose it

10 had been just as express as it could possibly be in the plan
11 that not only — they would put a footnote, and you also,
12 Mr. Association, release any claim you have to the fund in
13 North Carolina.

Suppose the plan had just said that, in

14 just plain black and white, and they accepted it.

Do you

15 think the association would be permitted under those
16 circumstances nevertheless to say, we still own the fund in
17 North Carolina?

QUESTION;

I think it would be inequitable to

I am talking about the law.

And in

21 those circumstances, in those circumstances it is claimed
22 that the judgment of the Indiana Court is entitled to full
23 faith and credit,

because the Association certainly had a

25 say that.

5

HE. PATTERSONj

Well, the first issue that would

6 have to be answered is whether the Indiana court had any
7 right to adjudicate rights at all in this deposit.
8

QUESTION:

Well, I think that gets back to what

9 you answered me earlier, doesn't it, Hr. Patterson, that
10 this fund simply never can be and never was under any
11 circumstances part of the assets of UNAC.
12

HR. PATTERSON:

13

QUESTION;

14

HR. PATTERSONj

It is not an asset of UNAC --

It never was, I think, is your position.
The Guaranty Association's

15 position is that no matter what the Indiana rehabilitation
16 proceedings said about this asset, it simply lacked
17 jurisdiction to deal with

18

QUESTION:

19 claims to the fund,
20 the

the asset.

Even though the people who own the
who were the beneficiaries of the fund,

policyholders, had given their interest to the

21 Association, you say the Association was powerless to
22 surrender its interest in the fund in Indiana litigation?
23 That sounds

24

strange.

MR. PATTERSONj

I don't think the Indiana court

25 had any jurisdiction to require it to do anything with the

40

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 deposit.

The deposit was clearly a North Carolina asset.

2

QUESTION:

What if the Association had employed a

3 driver to drive an automobile to St. Louis to attend an
4 insurance convention, and drove through Indiana, and was
5 involved in an accident, and Indiana sought to exert long
6 arm jurisdiction over the Association.

Would you say that

7 the assets of the fund were not available to satisfy any
8 judgment if a long arm jurisdiction were profferred?
9
10

NR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

Any judgment against Indiana?

Any judgment against the North Carolina

11 Association.

12

MR. PATTERSON:

I am afraid I don't understand the

13 question, Justice Rehnquist.
14

QUESTION:

Well, you are saying somehow that this

15 fund can never be reached, no matter what the North Carolina
16 Association does, and I am suggesting to you that if the
17 North Carolina Association engages in perhaps ventures that
18 it may not be empowered to do under state law, if those
19 ventures have an effect in another state, and the other
20 state can get jurisdiction over the Association by a long

21 arm statute, the fund may be an asset which can be used to
22 satisfy a judgment rendered in those proceedings.
23

MR. PATTERSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PATTERSON:

Against the Guaranty Association?

Yes.
Would this be based on an

41

1 assumption that the Guaranty Association had become a -2 been assigned some sort of beneficial interest in the trust?
3

QUESTION:

4 misapprehension.
5

Well, perhaps I am laboring under a

Just what is this trust?

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, the trust is for the sole

6 benefit and protection of North Carolina policyholders.

The

7 Guaranty Association has absolutely no right to this trust
8 until there has been a default by some insurance company,
9 UNAC here.

At that point, the Guaranty Association would

10 pay the policyholders of UNAC the amount of the fault, and
11 could then move against the deposit, which is where the
12 policyholders would have gone absent the Guaranty
13 Association.
14

The North Carolina statutory scheme is such that

15 the policyholders really have two sources to make them
16 whole.

First, they have the Guaranty Association, which is

17 statutorily required to step in.

If the Guaranty

18 Association weren't there, they would still have this
19 deposit that the policyholders could have gone to.

The

20 statutory scheme intermeshes, and what happens is, if the

21 Guaranty Association pays the policyholders off then and
22 only then does the Guaranty Association become subrogated to
23 the policyholders’ rights in such a way that it can move
24 against the deposit.
25

QUESTION:

Would you say that in effect North

6

lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in the deposit,

7 which North
8

I think the initial question, though, should be,

did Indiana get around applying the full faith and

the North Carolina statute, which

12 specified the policyholder

QUESTION:

rights in this deposit?

Well, if the North Carolina — if the

14 Indiana court did purport to do that, and did it wrongly,
15 wasn’t the North Carolina Association's remedy by appeal
16 through the Indiana courts rather than collateral attack?
17

KR. PATTERSON:

I think it would have been had

18 Indiana or had the rehabilitator given anyone even the
19 slightest hint that it purported to be dealing with this
20 deposit.

Until — It was over a year after the

9

MR. PATTERSON;
QUESTION;

10
11

That's correct.

Mr. Patterson, let me ask you a

question about how the fund may be used.

12 it,

As I understand

the rehabilitation proceeding has modified the rights of

13 the policyholders so that, to take an example, a claim for a
14 $1,000 injury before the rehabilitation proceeding might now
15 only be worth $700.
16

All right.

Now, if such a claim is made arising out of an

17 incident that occurs after the plan had been approved, would
18 it be your view that the policyholder just has the $700
19 entitlement, in my hypothetical example?
20 in turn mean that

And doesn't that

the likelihood that the fund may be

21 exhausted has changed because the obligations that it might

22 have to satisfy have been reduced?

23

So, inevitably, has not the possibility that that

24 fund will be used in certain ways have been changed by what
25 happened in Indiana?

Well, they did — in this case, I

bankrupt.

Now they would get from the state the $100,000 on

of $1,000.

12

MR. PATTERSONS

But they get that from the Association.

14

HR. PATTERSON;

That’s correct.

policyholders whole.
QUESTION;

6

MR. PATTERSON;

QUESTION:

Yes.

Then you would need to resort to the

8 bond, and you would have a lesser claim against the bond
9 because the policyholders there have received — have a
10 different bargain than they had before the Indiana
11 proceeding went forward.
12

You don't challenge the power of the Indiana court

13 to modify the kind of claim the policyholder can make
14 against that bond.
15

MR. PATTERSON:

No.

I think it is well settled

16 that a rehabilitation proceeding in one jurisdiction can
17 alter contractual policy rights and rights against the
18 general assets of an insurer, and in such a way that it will
19 affect policyholders in other jurisdictions.
20 settled.

That is well

But what is not at all settled is how deposits fit

21 into this scheme.

Deposits have been -- and there is a

22 great deal of state law, and there is a very interesting
23 guote from this Court as to the status of deposits, and as
24 to the fact that it is a special asset, and not subject to

This Court stated, "Insurance funds set apart in

15 insurance company doing business in the state on a trust

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, is it your position that

6

the Indiana court could not at any time litigate the

7

question of the subject matter jurisdiction insofar as the

8 deposit is concerned?
9
10

MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

The Indiana court in your view could

11

not even deal with the question in its courts of

12

jurisdiction.

13

Is that your position?

MR. PATTERSON:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor,

14

since it wasn't an asset of the insolvent insurer, it wasn't

15

an asset before the rehabilitation court.

16

QUESTION:

Even though you would concede that the

Indiana court had general jurisdiction over the

21

MR. PATTERSON:

said here about the general jurisdictional proposition that

1 if UNAC wanted to attempt to adjudicate these rights prior
2 to its final order of rehabilitation, then an ancillary
3 proceeding in North Carolina would have been appropriate.
4 This would not have been a burden on UNAC, who did business
5 in, I believe, 40 some states.
6

QUESTION:

All right, and there were other states

HR. PATTERSON;

Only four, Justice O'Conor.

And they did not make similar claims

10 such as North Carolin?
11

MR. PATTERSON:

Again, they are, were then and

12 probably are to this day completely unaware that UNAC has
13 asserted that its order cut off rights in this — in the
14 deposit made in their state.
15

I think in addition to the question of subject

17 certainly other jurisdictional claims here.
18 issue, I think, is quite significant.

25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Patterson, you refer to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 subject matter jurisdiction of a trial court of general
2 jurisdiction of a state.

Don’t they have subject matter

3 jurisdiction of all matters that are brought before them,
4 unless excluded by the law of the state in which they sit?
5

HR. PATTERSON;

Well, Indiana law, I think, is

6 fairly clear that to adjudicate rights in the trust, it must
7 have either the trust assets or the trustee before it.

Here

8 it had neither.
9

QUESTION;

Well, supposing that the Indiana court

10 made a wrong decision.

It still is entitled to full faith

11 and credit unless it had no jurisdiction.
12

MR. PATTERSON;

Well, assuming it fully and fairly

13 considered jurisdiction, I think that is correct.

The issue

14 here would be — in a collateral procedure, I think the
15 relevant inquiry is, was jurisdiction fully and fairly
16 considered, not whether the Indiana court actually had
17 jurisdiction.

Conceivably, Indiana could have fully and

18 fairly considered jurisdiction and incorrectly asserted it,
19 and

North Carolina would have been foreclosed, but that is

20 not what happened here.

There was no consideration of

21 jurisdiction at all.

QUESTION:

What happened between 1973 and the

3 beginning of the rehabilitation?
4

BE. PATTERSON:

At that point, the interest was

5 being collected and paid over to UNAC.

However, it was —

6 UNAC or the Department of Insurance had the right to stop
7 these payments at any time, and did so.
8

QUESTION:

Right.

And then after the

9 rehabilitation proceeding started, what happened to the
10 interest then?

Was it accumulated right away, or was it

QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, did the Guaranty

22 Association file a claim in the proceeding in Indiana, and
23 if so, what did it claim?

1 What happened is, the original draft of the plan of

The rehabilitation proceeding did not — said

6 that any of these future recoveries would go to the

Justice Stevens, if past practice

of the department were followed, the interest would begin to

To the insurance company.

In addition to being an income —

I suppose it would be fair to

UNAC as a contingent income beneficiary as

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

The asset is UNAC's, always is, always was,

It is pledged to secure against the default, and

the event of default, and only then can the North

22 Carolina Commissioner arrest the interest payments and do

There is

UNAC and the policyholders reached an agreement

25 whereby UNAC would offer ongoing insurance and

QUESTION*

Can't North Carolina tell you to

redeposit the $100,000 tomorrow?
MR. BOEHM;

4

Oh, we agree.

It is there.

It is in

5

the deposit, and we can't withdraw it unless we stop writing

6

the insurance on North Carolina insureds, but it is there to

7

secure a future default should we go in the tank again.
QUESTION;

10

I don't see what -- it seems to me it

is going to be there no matter who wins.

That is what

puzzles me.
MR. BOEHM*

11

We.ll, they are seeking to liquidate.

12

The remedy they request is that it be paid over to the

13

Guaranty Association.
QUESTION;

14
15

And then you would have to make another

deposit, if you wanted to write insurance in North Carolina.

16

MR. BOEHM;

MR. BOEHM;

19

QUESTION;

That is correct, I suppose.
Yes.
Although the basic —
That is what is really at stake, isn't

20 it?
21

MR. BOEHM;

Yes.

Yes.

I suppose that is

22 correct.

We haven’t anticipated that point, but the logic

23

of what you say seems correct, and we would have to make

24

another deposit, although I expect we would as a practical

25

matter stop writing insurance in that state.

QUESTION:

Hell, there was a time when some

2 insurance companies declined to do business in certain
3 states,

notably Texas, for reasons of that kind.

Is that

I

so?
MR. BOEHM:

6

Oh, yes, and that is, again, the basic

point of this case from our point of view is that this is an

7 insurance case, and

it is a regulated industry that has a

8 state statutory framework that tells the state Commissioner
9 in the state of domicile to do what the Indiana Commissioner
10 did here, and purports to make it stick

Mr. Boehm, I just didn’t really have a

the facts here.

Is the reason they

are entitled to the $100,000 because there has

that much in defaults subsequent to this plan?
MR. BOEHM:

16 default

No, there is no claim that UNAC is in

of any post-rehabilitation obligation.

UNAC is

17 honoring its policies as restructured today.
18

QUESTION;

And so they are claiming it on account

19 of default pre-rehabilitation —

20

MR. BOEHM;

21

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.
-- defaults, but I thought the

22 policyholders had accepted the new plan, so

I don't

what — what are the defaults on which they want

MR. BOEHM;

Your confusion is the same as ours,

1 Your Honor.

We think it is as simple as day that the

2 policyholders accepted the restructured policy, we are not
3 in default, and the money is there in its pledged state, if
4 you would, to secure future defaults.
5

QUESTION:

Mr. Boehm, I thought the funds were to

6 be used to pay the increased premium charges that arose out
7 of the rehabilitation.
8

MR. BOEHM:

That is going to be paid regardless of

9 the disposition of this case.

As a matter of the North

10 Carolina Guaranty Association’s statutory obligation to the
11 policyholders, it has to make up the additional benefits to
12 the policyholders in — UNAC — as between UNAC and the
13 policyholders, the policies are written down.

Now, it is

14 hard to explain this in a few words, because there is
15 disability income insurance, and what in effect they did is
16 change them

from non-cancellable, which means you can’t

17 raise the premium,

to guaranteed renewable, which means we

18 keep insuring these people.
19

QUESTION:

MR. EOEHM:

And the premiums have gone up.
The premiums have gone up, and —

Yes.

MR. BOEHM;

That is part of the —

5

QUESTION;

-- and the benefits have gone down.

Yes.

Yes, it —

Isn't that what we are talking about?
Yes, as I understand it —

6 There are two changes, basically.

And so it is a rather

7 complicated actuarial proposition.
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Boehm, don't other states have laws

9 similar to North Carolina's —
10

MR. BOEHM;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. BOEHM;

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. BOEHM;

Yes.
— concerning these deposits?
Yes.
Are they identical in fact?
I can't represent that, but I

15 believe —
16

QUESTION;

Do most states have laws that are

17 similar?
18

MR. BOEHM:

Oh, I think so.

It is a question of

19 administrative discretion whether they require a deposit
20 before they will admit a company, but I think most states
21 have a procedure for getting a deposit from a company that
22 they regard as suspect.

And in many cases you end up with

23 the situation we have here, where the amount of the deposit
24 is really miniscule, not enough to warrant the very

25 proceeding that your question focuses on.

58

Consider what would have happened if every

2 policyholder were perfectly delighted with the plan of
3 rehabilitation and nobody wanted to litigate or anything.
4 Nonetheless, the Respondent’s view would force a
5 mini-liquidation or rehabilitation in eight states where
6 there was nobody who was upset about it, because there would
7 be no way to make the thing a binding adjudication in one
8 form even though nobody was upset about anything.
9

QUESTION:

Has the North Carolina court yet held

10 that if you lose in this proceeding, that your opponent is
11 entitled to use the bond to reimburse itself for the
12 increased premium?
13

HR. BOEHM:

Yes, I think that is what the trial

14 court held.
15

QUESTION:

Yes, and you think the appellate court

16 approved of that?
17

MR. BOEHM:

I think so.

I find the appellate

18 court opinion a little opaque.

19

QUESTION:

Nell, frankly, I didn't get that out of

20 the appellate court opinion.

21

MR. BOEHM:

That is one reason —

Hell, I may be prejudiced — I mean,

22 my view of the appellate court opinion may be colored by
23 what went on in the trial court that I am aware of.

That is

24 what the trial court ordered, and —
25

QUESTION:

Well, was that order affirmed by the

59
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 appellate court?
2

HR. BOEHM:

I think so.

The word "affirmed" ends

3 up at the end of the opinion.
4

QUESTIONS

Well, that is usually what it means,

5 then, doesn't it?
6

HR. BOEHH:

I am trying to parse the logic of that

7 opinion.
8

QUESTION:

We often say around here it is

9 judgments we reveiw, not opinions.
10

HR. BOEHM:

Yes, sir.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
