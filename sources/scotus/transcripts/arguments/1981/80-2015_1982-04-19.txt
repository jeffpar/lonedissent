ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. BEATTY, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8
9

MR. BEATTY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the taxpayer Appellant in this state

10

income tax case is ASARCO, a New Jersey company which

11

has its corporate headquarters in New York.

12

business consists of mining, smelting, and refining

13

copper and various other metals at locations throughout

14

the United States.

15

the operation of a silver mine.

16

mining and processing operations are closely integrated

ASARCO’s

Its principal activity in Idaho is
Because all of ASARCO’s

t

17

in a functional sense, everyone agrees that it is

18

appropriate for Idaho to apply its three-factor

19

apportionment formula to ASARCO’s total operating income

20

in order to determine what portion of that income is

21

properly attributable to the Idaho activities and

22

therefore subject to Idaho tax.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BEATTY;

25

Their total business —
Their total business income from

the coordinated operation of their mining, smelting, and

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

refining operations in the United States

2

QUESTION;

Yes.

3

MR. BEATTY*

The issue here is whether Idaho

4

can apply the same apportionment formula to dividends,

5

interest, and capital gains that ASARCO received from

6

investments in five other companies which conducted all

7

of their operations totally outside Idaho.

8

QUESTION;

Doing what kind of business?

9

MR. BEATTY;

Three of them were in the mining

10

business comparable to ASARCO's.

11

metal fabricators who did no mining themselves but

12

simply manufactured metal products.

13

QUESTION;

The other two were

Would it be any different in your

14

view if they had a chain of hotels and a chain of

15

supermarkets?

16

MR. BEATTY;

I think there is no question,

/

17

Your Honor, at all, that if ASARCO operated a chain of

18

hotels, either as a division of ASARCO or as a

19

separately incorporated subsidiary that was wholly owned

20

by ASARCO, that Idaho would be constitutionally barred

21

by the due process clause from taxing any of the income

22

from the hotel operations, whether paid to ASARCO as a

23

share of divisional profits or as a dividend from a

24

separately incorporated subsidiary.

25

is, I think, clear from this Court's prior decisions.

The reason for that

Absent functional integration at the operational level.

2

there is no basis for combining the income of two

3

distinct operations and treating them as though it were

4

one unitary business which earned its income as a whole.

5

QUESTION*

Unless they had a hotel in Idaho.

6

ME. BEATTYs

I am assuming. Your Honor, that

7

the hotel operations are conducted entirely outside

8

Idaho.

9

dictum in the Adams Express case years ago, when this

I think this point was first established in a

10

Court posited exactly the type of question that the

11

Chief Justice just raised, and assumed that a single

12

party owned two separate and distinct operations in

13

different states.

14

operations were wholly owned by the same party so that

15

there was complete common control, this Court indicated

16

that there would be no basis for treating them as parts

Despite the fact that those

*

17

of a unitary operation, precisely because they were

18

separate and distinct at the operational level.

19

I think the same point came out very clearly

20

in the dialogue between Justice Stevens and Mr. Dexter

21

of the MTC during the Mobil oral argument several years

22

ago, when you posited the case very similar to the Chief

23

Justice's of a toy operation being conducted by Mobil as

24

a division totally outside Vermont, the taxing state in

25

that case, and I think Mr. Dexter properly recognized

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

that Vermont would be constitutionally barred from

2

taxing any portion of the profits generated by the toy

3

business in that type of situation precisely because

4

there is no functional integration that would call into

5

question the accounting for the separate and distinct

6

operations.
QUESTION*

7

8

That is whether it was operated as

a division or as a sub —
QUESTION*

9

Yes.

I think that Justice

10

Blackmun's opinion in Mobil makes it absolutely clear

11

that the focal point for the inquiry ought to be the

12

economic realities and not the legal form of doing

13

business.

14

was that the legal distinction between a subsidiary and

15

a division doesn’t affect the economic realities and

16

ought not to affect the apportionability of the income

Specifically, what the Court said in Nobil

/

17
18

the parent receives, and so —
QUESTION*

On that subject, let me ask you,

19

Nr. Beatty, now, I suppose as to the short-term interest

20

earnings that ASARCO might have in the money market, or

21

short-term securities to maintain cash needs, you

22 concede that that can be taxable by Idaho.
23

MR. BEATTY*

We do.

That, it seems to us, is

24

clearly income earned from ASARCO's regular business

25

activities.

It is employing its —

MR. BEATTY:

3
4

Well, all right.
— working capital on a

short-term basis.
QUESTION:

Now, what if it is places it on a

5

little longer term basis, then?

6

MR. BEATTY:

What is the difference?

I think if it places it in

7

permanent investments, in sizeable stock investments, or

8

in debentures, which are involved here to an extent,

9

that that type of permanent investment becomes

10
11

disassociated from the normal operating —
QUESTION:

But it is kind of hard to draw the

12

line, isn't it?

Some of these investments are for

13

longer periods, and some for shorter, and all of a

14

sudden you have a stock acquisition.

15

reasonably draw the line there?

16

MR. BEATTY:

How do you

I think as in all instances that

/

17

basically involve factual determinations, that you've

18

got to do it gradually, on a case by case basis, as you

19

see appropriate factual situations developing.

20

there is a clear difference between a very short-term

21

investment, which we are not contesting here, and a

22

permanent long-term investment that is held for many

23

years, as the investments here were.

24

the dividing line should be drawn, whether it should be

25

at a five-year, ten-year, or some other stated maturity,

I think

I don't frankly know, but I think —
QUESTION:

Well, what standard are we to lay

down constitutionally then to make the distinction?
MR. BEATTY*

The basic issue, it seems to me,

5

in these cases is not the treatment of the interest

6

income, but rather the treatment of the dividend income

7

flowing from investments in major operating companies,

8

and there, I think it is clear that the test that you

9

ought to apply is the one suggested in Mobil, Justice

10

Brennan, and that is, are the underlying operations that

11

generate the income used to pay the dividends

12

functionally related with the business activities of the

13

recipient, so that it is impossible to unscramble the

14

business and break it into separate component parts.

15

so, then it is a unitary business and the dividends

16

ought to be apportioned along with all the other income

'

of the unitary business.
QUESTION*

Without otherwise affecting the

apportionment formula?
MR. BEATTY*

Certainly not.

If the dividends

are going to be treated as apportionable income, then I

22 think it is absolutely essential that the property,
23

payroll, and sales that generated that income be taken

24

into account in the apportionment factors.

MR. EEATTY*

2

QUESTION*

All of them
So you think there are only two

3

categories in this business.

4

not.

5
6

MR. BEATTY:

They are either unitary or

I think that is correct.

It

seems to me that if the operations are going to be

7 treated as unitary, and the income is going to be
8

apportioned. Justice White, that it is essential in

9

order to get true apportionment to reflect all of the

10 factors associated with the earning of that income.
11
12
13

QUESTION*

So no dividend income can be taken

into account unless the denominator changes, too.
MR. BEATTY*

Let me indicate our recognition

14 of conceivable exceptions to that rule.
15

We noted in our

brief the possibility that ownership of stock could be a

16 necessary part of the taxpayer's business in the sense
t

17

that applying the functional standards of Mobil, the

18 ownership is an indispensible adjunct to the conduct of
19

the business, as it would be clearly if the taxpayer

20 holding the stock investments that produced the income
21

were a securities dealer whose business was the buying

22 and selling of stocks.
23

Another possible example would be that of a

24 conractor who has to post bond in order to bid and
25

perform on jobs, and for that purpose maintains a

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

portfolio of investment securities, be they debt or

2

equity securities that he can use to fulfill his bonding

3

obligations.

4

securities is clearly an adjunct to the actual conduct

5

of the taxpayer’s own business, and in that type of

6

situation I think the proper application of Mobil is to

7

look at the functional relationship between the

8

ownership of those securities and the conduct of the

9

taxpayer’s business, but nothing of that sort is

10
11
12

There, the ownership of the stock, and

involved here.
QUESTIONi

Well, what if ASARCO, in order to

develop some sources for materials, wants to get some

13 copper out of some foreign country, and it finds out
14

that in order to do it it has to form a domestic

15 corporation, domestic in that other country, and it can
16 only buy 48 percent of it, and if it wants any of that
$

17 copper, that’s the way it has to do business.

Now, is

18 that one of your exceptions or not?
19

MR. BEATTY*

We have several situations here,

20 and I think it might be helpful to deal with the facts
21

of those situations, because one of the dividend-paying

22 companies here. Southern Peru, comes approximately into

23 the range that you are describing.
24

QUESTION*

Well, are you going to address that?

25

MR. BEATTY:

I will indeed.

Let me describe

It does not.

We own 53 percent.
I suppose you know, but if it isn’t

16 in the record, I won't ask.
17

MR. BEATTY*

The operations of MIM, as I said,

18 are conducted entirely in Australia and England.

The

19 state district court made an undisputed finding that
20

those operations were carried on entirely independently

21

of ASARCO.

22

transactions between the two companies, and there were

There were virtually no inter-company

23 no common officers or directors.
24

QUESTION*

Well, there is an intimation in the

25 other briefs that economic realities were the cause of

11

1

this.

Do you agree with that?

2

MR. BEATTY*

Well, there was testimony at

3

trial to the effect that ASARCO decided not to exercise

4

its controlling stock, interest in order to elect the

5

board bf directors or the officers of HIM because MIM

6

was performing admirably on its own.

7

free-standing enterprise, run and managed by

8

Australians.

9

control should not be controlling.

It was a separate,

I think that our capacity theoretically to
What ought to be

10

controlling is the actual undisputed facts, and there is

11

no dispute about the fact that ASARCO played no role

12

whatsoever in the management or the operation of MIM's

mining and smelting activities in Australia and England.
QUESTION*

14

Well, let me go back to my

MR. BEATTYs

There was an indication that

2

because of the distance between Australia and the United

3

States, it would have been uneconomic in most instances

4

to ship ores and concentrates from Australia to the

United States, but I think it is immaterial why there

were no inter-company transactions.

is that there were none.

QUESTIONS

The important fact

Do you think it would make a

difference if ASARCO had exercised its control and
elected all members of the board?
MR. BEATTYs

By simply electing board members,

12

Justice White, I don't think ASARCO should have changed

13

the result here.

14

there were an indication that the management of the

15

working operations was being dictated by ASARCO.

16

major stock investment is going to involve participation

17

by the investor in an oversight manner.

To me it would be significant only if

23

Why would that make it different from a

MR. BEATTY:

I don’t think that participation

24

in management in and of itself would be significant.

25

Justice Stevens.

I think it would begin to point in the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

direction of functional integration, and would perhaps

2

call for a closer inquiry as to —

3
4

QUESTION:

Would that be because you are

allocating part of the central office expense —

5

MR. BEATTY:

QUESTION:

7

— to the management?

Is that what

it would be?

8

SR. BEATTY:

QUESTION:

10

hotel company, too?

11

Yes.

Yes.
Why wouldn't that be true of a

MR. BEATTY:

Well, to the extent that there is

12

overlapping centralized management so that the hotel

13

company benefits in some way from the operations of the

14

mining company or vice versa, you start to approach the

15

functional integration that was involved in the Exxon

16

case, but you only start to approach it.

Again, I

i

17

think, as I indicated to Justice O'Connor, all these

18

questions are ones of degree.

19

QUESTION:

Do you think, Mr. Beatty, our cases

20

have laid down any criteria by which one determines

21

functional integration?

22

suggested it in the sense that every case --

QUESTIONS

2

Have you any suggestions what they

ought to be?

3

HR. BEATTY;

I think, basically you need to

4

look at three factors, Justice Brennan.

5

the different enterprises is clearly necessary, but not

6

sufficient.

7

common ownership, clearly, there is no basis for finding

8

a unitary business simply because of transactions

9

between the various elements of the activity that you

Ownership of

Unless there is a substantial degree of

are looking at.

As I indicated earlier, though, 100

11

percent common ownership I don’t think is sufficient to

12

create a unitary business.

13

that.

14

at is the management aspect, and by that I am not

15

referring to the board of directors’ supervision of a

16

stewardship nature.

You have got to go beyond

The second factor that I think should be looked

I am referring to management

t

17
18

participation at an operational level.
QUESTION*

In other words, ASARCO*s management

19 has to participate at the operational level of the
20
21

subsidary before you have functional integration.
MR. BEATTYs

I think so, yes.

But again, I

22

don’t think that that is sufficient.

The third and most

23

important criteria that I think you have to look at is

24

the degree to which the various business activities

25

involved are interrelated in some sort of functional

2

presented, I think, clear examples of that.

instance, you were looking at a vertically integrated

from exploration to drilling to production to refining

to marketing of the end product, and clearly —

But it wouldn't be enough that both

are copper mines.

9

MR. BEATTY;

The fact that both are engaged in

10

the same line of business doesn't thus mean that there

11

is any functional integration.

12

there are two parallel lines of business which may never

13

intersect, and in the case of MIM virtually never did

14

intersect.

15

this same emphasis on functional integration.

So that if you had both in the

copper business and the subsidiary’s product was

3

marketed to customers of the parent, that would be

enough ?

5

That is certainly abnormal

7

conceivable you might have exceptions, and —

9

QUESTION:

It is

But if it is all marketed in

England, and never sees any of the — no customer in the

10

United States so the parent ever gets to it, then there

11

is no functional integration.

12

MR. BEATTY:

I am not necessarily suggesting

13

that geographical boundary lines determine the extent of

14

a functionally related business.

15

fact, ale manufactured in Great Britain was sold in New

16

Y.ork by the same company, and you, I think properly,

17

treated that as one unitary business.

18

pointed out there, the manufacturing arm earned no

19

income until the product was sold, and it is equally

20

clear that the sales organization could have earned no

21

income unless it had a manufactured product to sell, so

22

that is the classic type of functional integration case.

Now, you were going to get to

another polar case, I guess.
MR. BEATTY:

The other case that we do need to

deal with is Southern Peru, which is at the opposite end

2

of the spectrum from HIM in the array of individual

3

situations presented to you here, because we admittedly

4

did have substantial business dealings with Southern

Peru, and it was a source of supply to ASARCO.

important factors, though, I think, are that ASAPCO is

the major custom smelter of copper in the United

States.

comparable to those which ASARCO had with Southern

charged under those contracts were the same as the

None whatsoever.
Mr. Beatty, would you concede that

any state can include this income for tax purposes, the

21

MR. BEATTY*

I think that the domiciliary

apportionable income.

It is your position that the

QUESTION*

Well, one of your factors is

present here that isn't true with the other.
MR. BEATTY*

That is absolutely correct, and

7

we recognize that Southern Peru is not as strong a case

8

from our standpoint as HIM for that precise reason.

9

I don’t think that it reaches the point of functional

But

10

integration or unity that is involved in a situation

11

like Exxon’s, where a wholly owned enterprise was being

12

conducted in a way that maximized the operating

13

efficiencies.

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose you would say, Mr.

15

Beatty, that even if the third criterion is met, the

16

second is not, in the case of Southern Peru.

MR. BEATTY*

Correct, although we have the

capacity to manage, and although ASARCO’s officers --

But you don’t in fact.

20

MR. BEATTY*

-- ASARCO’s officers do in fact

21

serve in some years as officers of Southern Peru, we

22

cannot unilaterally control Southern Peru by virtue of

23

this bylaw structure that ensures that the other

24

shareholders collectively can outvote us.

25

QUESTION*

Would your claim on Southern Peru

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

from that mine to a Utah smelter, and it was a

completely different metal, you just bought the metal,

you were in the mining business, but none of that metal

ever came to Idaho, that would be an HIM case.
HR. BEATTY*

No.

I doubt that, because our

domestic operations are so functionally integrated.

Perhaps we have been unduly

generous to Idaho and the other states in the reaction

19

that we have pursued thus far.

20

(General laughter.)

21

HR. BEATTY*

But we have not challenged the

22 idea that all of our domestic metals operations are

2

formula that Idaho applies.

3

QUESTION*

4

MR. BEATTY*

All right.
Let me, if I could, turn just

5 briefly to the alternative questions relating to
6

adjustment of the apportionment factor.

The state urges

7 that no adjustment be made because the income that we
8

are receiving is income from intangibles, and that

9 somehow those intangibles should be viewed as being
10

owned everywhere where our domestic business is being

11

conducted.
That is not the economic realities of this

12

13 case at all.

The economic realities are that the income

14 in question was generated by the property, payroll, and
15 sales of Mount Isa and Southern Peru and General Cable.
16 The stipulated record shows that the five
/

17 dividend-paying companies had aggregate sales in each
18 year of over $1,100,000,000.

Idaho didn't take into

19 account one cent of that money in its apportionment
20

formula.

The record shows that the five dividend-paying

21

companies owned smelters, refineries, mines, seaports, a

22

whole host of property values, none of which Idaho took

23 into account.
24

QUESTION*

But you are saying they have to

25 take all of it into account.

MR. BEATTY;

We are talking here, the state

has conceded in its brief that these operations are not

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. SPANGLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

please the Court, Idaho's position in this case is

2

really quite simple, and very fundamental, and, we

3

think., entirely consistent with the previous decisions

4

of this Court.

5

as, for example, shares of stock, are found to be a part

6

of a taxpayer's own unitary business, that is, when

7

they, the intangibles, contribute to or relate to or are

8

some way in furtherance of the taxpayer’s own trade or

9

business, there is no logical or constitutional reason

That is that when intangible assets such

10

why the income from those same intangibles should be

11

treated any differently than any other business income

12

that that taxpayer might earn.

13
14
15

QUESTION;

How about the income from the hotel

chain, or the dividends from the hotel chain?
MR. SPAHGLER;

Mr. Justice, I might answer

16

that question by pointing out that the Idaho Supreme

17

Court in this case did not permit apportionment of

18

dividends from a company that was engaged in asbestos

19

mining in Canada.

20

that the intangible asset was not held for purposes that

21

were specifically related to or in furtherance of this

22

unitary business that ASARCO admittedly conducts partly

23

in the state of Idaho.

»

What the Idaho court found there was

24

The issue for due process purposes, we think,

25

is whether or not the intangible asset itself, like any

purposes relating to or in furtherance of that unitary

What they said, sir, was that

Was there record evidence on this

that because they had shown a complete lack of

relationship between the asset, the intangible asset,

18

the shares of stock, and their mining, smelting, and

refining of non-ferrous metals activities that they

conducted in the United States, that those were not

MR. SPANGLER:

Precisely, sir.

In regard to

2

the five corporations at issue here, the Idaho court

specifically said that ASARCO had acquired and

maintained its ownership interest in these companies as

an integral and necessary part of its mining and

MR. SPANGLER:

QUESTION:

10

Again based on record evidence?
Yes, sir.

Had those findings been made by

your trial court as well?
MR. SPANGLER:

11

At the trial court level, the

12

trial judge had concluded to the contrary in regard to

13

these particular subsidiaries, and what the Idaho court

14

said was that in regard to these particular

15

subsidiaries, the trial court’s conclusion was not

16

consistent with the evidence that was in the record.

MR. SPANGLER:

Yes, sir, I do.

You mean, in furtherance of?
The language of the Uniform

Act, which is really — the constitutionality of which

25

is really at issue here, the statutory standard that the

Idaho court followed was, were these -- was this income

2

from tangible or intangible property acquired, managed,

3

or disposed of in the regular course of the taxpayer’s

trade or business, and that is — before they ever got

to the constitutional issue, the Idaho court had to

conclude under that uniform statute standard that the

intangible assets were related to and in furtherance of

the unitary business activity.

You then have on the other end of the

spectrum, and there were six subsidiaries with ASARCO

should be included in a combined report, with the result

that all of the income was in the apportionable base,

This is really the third case.

This is the

11

that are an integral and necessary part of that

unitary —

QUESTION:

May I ask, to be sure we have it

14 clearly understood, do you concede that this
15

intermediate category is not part of the unitary

16

17

MS. SPANGLER:

We have conceded, or we have

not asserted that those subsidiary corporations are

And unless it affects the

profitability of the in-state operations, you are

13

MR. SPANGLERs

Yes, sir, and our point is that

14

it does affect the profitability of the in-state

operation, because that in-state operation is part of

16

this inseparable unitary business, and these intangible

17

assets, as'distinguished from the corporations, the

18

other corporations themselves, are also part of that

19

inseparable unitary business, and because intangibles by

20

their very nature have no particular geographic source,

21

then when they relate to where — to every place where

22

the business activity occurs, that it is entirely

reasonable and constitutional to say that all of the

I would not draw the line

would look to what is the purpose for making this

23

investment, whether it is an investment in a — whether

24

25

whether it is a long-term investment in shares of stock.

2

look to the purpose of the investment and say, is this

3

investment being made for purposes which are an integral

4

and necessary part of the taxpayer's unitary trade or

5

business, and I would not apply, as ASARCO is asking the

6

Court to do here, a different due process standard to

7

one category of investment as opposed to another.

8

9

I would

What ASARCO is saying is that fine, if it is
an investment, a short-term investment of working

10

capital, the fact that that is part of the unitary trade

11

or business is sufficient to allow it to be fairly

12

apportioned, but they want to establish a stricter or a

13

more — a higher standard when the investment happens to

14

be in shares of stock.

15

Now, we don't think that the standard is

16

different, whether it is investments in shares of stock,

17

whether it is investments in working capital, whether

18

the income is being earned from short-term accounts

19

receivable, or whether it is investment in the physical

20

operating factories and mines, that the same due process

21

standard applies, and once — you know, they have not

22

contended that the Idaho court was wrong in its factual

23

conclusion.

24

intangible shares of stock were not acquired and

25

maintained as part of ASARCO's integral and necessary

That is, they have not contended that the

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

trade or business.
Shat they have said is that in the case of the

3

shares of stock, there is an additional standard, that

4

is, functional integration, and as we read Mobil, what

5

this Court rejected in that Mobil decision was the idea

6

that some special due process standard applied to

7

dividends, that instead, whether -- whatever the

8

category of intangible or whatever the category of asset

9

producing the income, the Court said that it was still

10

incumbent upon the taxpayer to carve out some clear and

11

cogent exception.

12

Now, the functional integration language in

13

ASARCO is useful to help show that there was a business

14

purpose, that the -- was a part of or that — at least

15

that Mobil had not shown that these assets were not part

16
17

of its regular trade or business activities, but it is
/
the business purpose for which those intangibles were

18

held, in our view, that is the significant thing for due

19

process purposes, not whether or not there was or wasn't

20

functional integration.

21

If there was functional integration, then we

22

would combine, and we would view that as one single

23

business entity, and we would in Idaho recognize the

24

property, payroll, and sales of the entire business

25

activity, and we would eliminate the inter-company

1

2

transfers, including the dividends.
Once that’s clear, you know, once it's clear

3

that the justification for the apportionment is the fact

4

that this is an asset which is part of that business

5

activity, then it becomes clear, we think, that there is

6

no logic at all to reaching outside the confines of that

7

unitary business activity to bring in the property,

8

payroll, and sales of some other business for the

9

purpose of apportioning that, any more than you would in

10

the case of interest on a trade account receivable.

11

would not say that the customer must be functionally

12

integrated, or that you must reflect the property,

13

payroll, and sales of that trade —

14

QUESTION*

Hr. Spangler, would you take the

15

position that if they were part of the functionally

16

integrated business, then you would apply the sales,

17

property, and payroll factors?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE V. SPANGLER, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE - CONTINUED

6

MR. SPANGLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

and may it please the Court, returning to the discussion

8

that we had this morning about the standard that was

9

applied, of course, the standard that the Idaho court

10

applied first, in the first instance, was a statutory

11

standard, and then it proceeded to say that that

12

statutory standard was consistent with the due process

13

requirements of the Constitution.

14

of course, that the statutory standard is necessarily,

15

as applied by the Idaho court, is necessarily equal to

16

the full extent of what that constitutional standard

17

might be.

18

That is not to say,

I would think in terms of trying to formulate

19

a constitutional standard there are probably two

20

questions that should be asked in regard to income such

21

as that that is at issue here, to determine whether or

22

not there is a violation of the due process clause.

23

two questions are, what is the purpose of the

24

investment, and the second is, how is the income used?

has conceded in its brief, and Mr. Spangler has twice

said during oral argument today that the five

dividend-paying companies involved in this case were not

part of ASARCO's unitary business.

5

undisputed facts in the record of this case, and there

is absolutely no dispute about those facts, bears out

the correctness of that concession, and on that we rest

our case.

QUESTION:

He think, the

But may I ask one question?

That

just makes this income from those companies like the

11

income in Mobil from, say, the utility company.

12

Remember the list of subsidiaries.

13

utility companies were not part of Mobil's unitary

14

business.

15

state in that case could have proved that Mobil could

16

only sell its products to one of those utilities if it

Now, clearly, the

But supposing Mobil could — or supposing the

was also a shareholder, that it was just necessary in

18

order to generate the sales.

19

utility stock then have been treated as part of the

20

unitary business?

MR. EEATTY:

Would the income from the

May I first begin with the

observation that in Mobil, there was absolutely no proof

23

at all of the relationship —

companies, so the decision in Mobil, it seems to me,

proves nothing.

The taxpayer lost in that case because

QUESTION*

5

MR. BEATTY*

I understand.
If the record shoved that an

6 investment was made purely and simply for the purpose of
7 obtaining needed supplies or providing a customer
8 outlook, if that were the only purpose of the
9 investment, I think it might indeed be relevant.

It

10 might be one of the cases that you were suggesting
11

earlier where ownership of the stock was so integrally

12 involved in the taxpayer's own business activities that
13 it would be a part of the unitary business.
14

QUESTION*

So you would acknowledge then there

15 could be an intermediate category, but you just define
16 it more strictly than the state would.
17

MR. BEATTY:

I do.

You might in that

18 connection want to take a look at a case called W.W.
19 Windell, 65 TC 694, which discussed somewhat similar
20 problems as they arise under federal tax law.

That case

21 held that the existence of a significant business
22 motivation for an investment did not convert the
23 business investment from the normal capital asset status
24 that it would have for federal tax purposes into a
25 business asset that would give rise to ordinary income

54

or loss on disposition.
I do not want to suggest in any sense that the

3

constitutional test ought to be the same as the federal

4

income tax test, but if you wanted to pursue that line

5

of inquiry, it seems to me that that is a line Of cases

6

that you might want to look at.

7

8

QUESTIONi

Hr. Beatty, when you answered

Justice Stevens, yes, there is an intermediate category,

9 but you would define it more strictly, I take it you
10

would still insist on the other leg of your argument,

11

that there should be a change in the denominator.
