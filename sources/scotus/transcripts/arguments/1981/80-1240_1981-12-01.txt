ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. WEINSTEIN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court, this case is here on a petition for
10 certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
11 Seventh Circuit.

The issue presented is whether the court

12 of appeals decision conflicts with this Court's 1979
13 decision in United States versus Timmreck, and thereby goes
14 beyond those due process requirements required for a knowing
15 and voluntary guilty plea.

In other words, does Timmreck

16 mandate a contrary result?
17

It is our position that the court of appeals

18 decision does indeed conflict with Timmreck.

We believe

19 that if any error occurred, it was only a failure to comply
20 with the formal requirements of Illinois Supreme Court Rule
21402.

That is the Illinois rule which pertains to the entry

22 of guilty pleas, and it is the state counterpart to Rule 11
23 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which was the
24 issue, or which was the rule involved in Timmreck.
25

We also submit that Rule 402 is very similar in

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 content to the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 11 -2 Criminal Procedure.

Therefore, we believe —

3

Mr. Weinstein, before you get into your

QUESTION:

4 argument, may I ask you a question about the facts?

As I

5 understand it, the relief granted by Judge Marshall, was it,
6 in this case, was to cancel the three-year mandatory parole
7 term, to modify the sentence.
8

MR. WEINSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct. Your Honor.

And as I also understand it, these two

10 Respondents have actually served their sentences.
11

MR. WEINSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WEINSTEIN:

That is correct.

Why isn't the case moot?
The question arose in the Seventh

14 Circuit the first time it was before the Seventh Circuit,
15 and that court ruled and, we believe, correctly, that there
16 were certain collateral consequences that would attach to
17 the Petitioners -- at that time there were three, actually
18 four -- if the use of their parole term or the fact that
19 they had violated parole and had started to serve a parole
20 term could later be used if they committed another crime in
21 that regard.
22

However, more importantly, perhaps, we perceive a

23 situation of, because the parole terms are so short -- at
24 that time they were five, three, and two years, and now they
25 have been modified by statute to three, two, and one — we

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

have a situation where we have a problem wh ich is capable of

2 repetition yet evading review.
3

QUESTION;

Well, but all the judg e has to do is

4

order — I mean, if he had granted relief i n the form of

5

requiring that the man be allowed to plead again, to enter a

6 new plea, then it wouldn't be moot, because you would set
7

aside the judgment of guilt, which would se em to me to be

8 the correct relief on habeas corpus.
9

I don't understand the relief on habeas corpus

10

where you modify a sentence.

11

power to do that?

12

MR. WEINSTEIN;

Where does th e judge get the

I assume that -- and far be it

13

from me to assume what Judge Marshall felt, but I a ssum e

14

that his feeling was that it would be unfai r to all ow t he

15

individuals to replead because in fact they had air eady

16

started serving their time, that is, the ma ndato ry paro le

17

If they were allowed to replead, the state could th en

18

prosecute them all over again, and who know s --

19

QUESTION;

Well, maybe they are u nwise to seek

20 that relief, but isn't that the only relief the statute
21

22

offered them?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

Well, the Seventh Circuit didn’t

23

allow that type of relief in Baker versus F inkbeiner, which

24

was the first case, and Judge Marshall was obviously

25

applying the Baker case to these particular facts.

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Weinstein, certainly this Court has

2

virtually bent itself into a corkscrew on mootness on behalf

3

of habeas plaintiffs in cases like Sedbaum versus New York

4

and Carafas versus Lavalay, talking about the future

5

consequences, denial of job opportunities, and that sort of

6

thing, as to mootness, hasn’t it?

7

MR. WEINSTEIN;

Yes, Justice Rehnquist.

The point

8

that I want to make is that Judge Marshall has before him a

9

class action involving the same issue.

He has certified the

10

class already.

I assume that if this Court were to

11

determine that this case were moot, and from our particular

12

standpoint, of course, the decision would be vacated and we

13

would technically win, nevertheless Judge Marshall will

14

probably go ahead and still make the same ruling with regard

15

to the class, and we would be back -- well, we may not be

16

back here --

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. WEINSTEIN;

19

Yes, but the question is --- but we would be back arguing

the case once again.
QUESTION;

20

Well, maybe it would be unfortunate,

21

but if it is moot, we don’t have any power to do anything

22

about it.

23

MR. WEINSTEIN;

24

QUESTION;

25

I understand.

And the cases Justice Rehnquist

referred to were cases where there were collateral

6

1

KR. WEINSTEIN*

Initially it was granted in

2 January of 1978.
3

QUESTION*

And they were in prison then?

4

KR. WEINSTEIN*

They were.

One of them was not

5 actually in prison, but he was still in custody because he
6 was serving out the remainder of his sentence on a new
7 parole.
8

QUESTION;

Was there any question about their

9 having exhausted state remedies?
10

MR. WEINSTEIN;

Yes.

In the first case Williams

11 won, when we went to the Seventh Circuit the first time, we
12 argued the substantive issues, but we also argued the
13 question of exhaustion of state court remedies.
14
15 remedies?
16

QUESTION;

Well, why had they exhausted state

You still don't know, do you?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

Well, Your Honor, the Seventh

17 Circuit ruled that they had to exhaust state remedies.
18 case was returned to Judge Marshall.

Judge Marshall placed

19 it on what he called his past case calendar.
20 held it in abeyance.

The

Actually, he

There was another case which did not

21 involve these Petitioners that was pending before the
22 Illinois Supreme Court on a petition for leave to appeal,
23 which is the same as petition for certiorari.
24

The Illinois Supreme Court denied that petition.

25 Judge Marshall then felt that taking that into --

MR. WEINSTEIN:

That it would he futile.
That it would be futile.

That is

correct.

4

QUESTION;

And is that the rule around in

Illinois, that you don't need to exhaust state remedies in

those --

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Well, I don't believe it is, Your

Honor.

We did not -- We did not subsequently re-raise the

11

Hearing Act, which is our belief what these Respondents

12

should have exhausted, the Post-Conviction Hearing Act in

13

Illinois specifies they must be in prison, and at that time

14

they were no longer in prison.

The first was that the Post-Conviction

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WEINSTEIN:

I see.
Secondly, there was and still is

17

another case pending in the Seventh Circuit, Norman versus

18

Scott, in which the exhaustion once again --

19

QUESTION:

So there is no collateral relief --

20

there was no -- at least there is no collateral relief

21

available now in Illinois for these people?

22
23
24
25

MR. WEINSTEIN;

For these particular people, I do

not believe so.
QUESTION:

I don’t understand, Mr. Weinstein,

getting back to my brother Stevens' question to you, what

them back in prison, as I understand you.

2

MR. WEINSTEIN*

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. WEINSTEIN;

5

QUESTION;

6

Do you want to?
Do we want to?

Well --

You just want to restore their

mandatory parole, don't you?

7

MR. WEINSTEIN;

8

QUESTION;

9

No, we cannot.

That is correct, Your Honor, and

Will there then be, if you prevail,

will they from now on be on mandatory parole?

10

MR. WEINSTEIN;

The individuals were both -- or

11

one of them was released on bail pending the first Seventh

12

Circuit decision, and the Department of Corrections let

13

their time run out.

14

They would not have revoked them had they done something

15

else.

16

QUESTION;

They then subsequently released them.

Well, your answer to me then is, they

17

do not -- if you prevail, they will not be restored to

18

mandatory parole.

19

20

MR. WEINSTEIN;

I do not believe

that they will be.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. WEINSTEIN;

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. WEINSTEIN;

25

No, Your Honor.

Then why isn't it moot?
Excuse me?

Why isn't the case moot?
Again, Your Honor, we believe it

is not moot because of the possible collateral consequences

2

QUESTION i

If they commit, crimes in the future.

3

MR. WEINSTEIN;

If they commit crimes in the

4 future.
5

QUESTION;

No matter what you do, the records are

6 going to be the same.
7

QUESTION;

Certainly the recidivist statute --

8 this would be a conviction of a crime with a mandatory
9 parole sentence on their record that if we reversed and it
10 would not be if we affirmed.
11

MR.

WEINSTEIN;

That is my point exactly. Justice

12 Rehnquist.
13

QUESTION;

You have to explain that to me.

As I

14 understand it, the conviction of the crime will remain, no
15 matter what happens in this case.
16

MR. WEINSTEIN;

The conviction of the crime will

17 remain.
18

QUESTION;

And the records that show that they

19 violated their parole will remain there.
20

MR. WEINSTEIN;

The records show at the present

21 time that the district court entered a writ of habeas
22 corpus, that their mandatory parole terms could not continue
23 to be served, and if in fact we were to prevail, that would
24 be expunged from the records.

There would be no indication

25 that they ever prevailed at all in the district court and in

MR. WEINSTEIN:

In which event if you lose this case -- but that the relief --

-- he would be entitled to have his

MR. WEINSTEIN*

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And have a new trial.

10

MR. WEINSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Excuse me, Your Honor?

And have a new trial.
And have a new trial.

The key is

13 that the relief -- the relief that was granted was simply
14 the expungement of the parole term.
15

QUESTION*

It was not --

That may be the relief, but the

16 rationale was that he was never convicted.
17

MR. WEINSTEIN*

18

QUESTION*

That's correct.

That is correct.

And you don't want that kind of a

19 record to -- you want the record to show he was properly
20 convicted.
21

MR. WEINSTEIN*

22

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Justice White.

And you surely, I take it, do not want

23 it sent back if Judge Marshall, District Judge Marshall was
24 in error.
25

You don't want it sent back and have a new trial
MR. WEINSTEIN:

No, Your Honor.

1

QUESTION ;

Although -- the potential sentence was

2 up to 20 years here, wasn't it?
3

MR. WEINSTEIN;

The potential sentence, both of

4 the individuals plead guilty to the crime of burglary.

At

5 that time burglary carried a potential sentence of anywhere
3 from one to 20 years incarceration.
7

QUESTION;

In a new trial, in your view, could

8 they be given a sentence exceeding the one that was
9 originally given, even though it would have then been
10 declared to be a nullity?
11

MR. WEINSTEIN;

I hesitate to go that far,

Mr.

12 Chief Justice.
13

QUESTION;

But, Mr. Weinstein, I thought you

14 answered me earlier that if you win, nothing can happen to
15 these fellows.

You can't get them back to prison.

How can

16 they retry them?
17

MR. WEINSTEIN;

As Justice White has pointed out,

18 while the relief that was ordered was that they would
19 expunge the mandatory parole term,

the rationale is that the

20 underlying plea was invalid because they had never been
21 admonished -22

QUESTION;

Well, is there any judgment setting

23 aside the conviction?

Judge Marshall certainly entered no

24 such judgment.
25

MR. WEINSTEIN;

I don't believe he actually

They didn’t ask for any such judgment

I suspect that the --

They didn't even allege they wouldn't

MR. WEINSTEIN:

T suspect that th ey probably

because both of these petiti ons were filed

12 just after the Seventh Circuit decided

In fact, one of the petit ions quite

refers right to that Baker case, an d I think it is

15 very clear

that they saw the Baker case and

they said, aha

MR. WEINSTEIN:

they would be out right then and there.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 another case to test whether they could have an increased
2 sentence the second time around.
3

MR. WEINSTEIN:

4

QUESTION:

Well,

that is possible.

Mr. Weinstein, how can you retry them

5 without setting aside the judgment of convictions?
6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

QUESTION ;

How can you treat this as if it were an

8 invalid plea,
9
10

which meanst that the conviction was improper?

MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, unfortunately --

That is not the way the case comes to

11 us.

12

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Unfortunately,

that is the

13 rationale that Judge Marshall used.
14

QUESTION:

The rationale that the district court

QUESTION:

Well, it was one of the questions from

15 used.
16

17 the bench that raised the question whether Judge Marshall
18 had authority to do what he did, that is, to modify the
19 sentence by striking the mandatory parole.

He either had to

20 grant full relief, which meant a new trial, or nothing.
21

MR. WEINSTEIN:

22 the Baker disposition.

Judge Marshall was relying upon
I believe Baker was relying,

23 perchance, on the Santobello disposition.

QUESTION:

Did Baker come here, Mr. Weinstein?

Baker did not come here.

9 present in this case.

That is our belief.

That is not

In Timmreck, the Solicitor General's

10 office stated the question as being whether a defendant may
11 obtain collateral relief from his conviction under Section
122255 solely because the district court violated Rule 11 in
13 accepting his guilty plea.

We submit that if one

14 substitutes Section 2254 for 2255, and Illinois Supreme
15 Court Rule 402 for Rule 11, our case raises the same issue.
16

We believe that Timmreck held that the failure to

17 admonish as to a mandatory parole term, in Timmreck's case
18 the mandatory special parole term, merely constitutes a
19 failure to comply with the formal requirements of a rule
20 governing the entry of guilty pleas, and does not constitute
21 a constitutional defect so as to give rise to habeas corpus
22 relief.
23

Indeed, habeas corpus relief should not be allowed

24 to do service for an appeal.

In this particular case,

25 neither of the Petitioners ever took a direct appeal, nor

18

1 did they file an Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act.
2 Indeed, they have not filed any type of petition, sought any
3 type of appeal in the Illinois courts.
4

We believe the cases are similar in that both

5 case and Timmreck involved a plea bargain.

this

Neither in

6 Timmreck nor here was a direct appeal taken.

Indeed, as we

7 indicated, this issue was not raised at all until after the
8 Baker decision of -- in response to that decision making the
9 rounds of Stateville.
10

And most importantly, neither respondent has ever

11 alleged or argued that he would not have plead guilty had he
12 known of the mandatory parole term.
13

The Illinois Supreme Court in the People versus

14 Wills decision found that the mandatory parole term
15 admonishment is required under Supreme Court Pule 402.
16 However, it also found that the failure to admonish, while
17 error, is not of constitutional significance.

It is simply

18 one factor to be taken into account when determining whether
19 or not the plea
20

was voluntary.

QUESTION:

Would that be particularly so if there

21 is no allegation that the man was -- had not been informed
22 by his counsel, for example, of the three-year mandatory
23 sentence -- mandatory parole provision?
24

MR. WEINSTEIN:

25

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

I don't —

If the Petitioner seeking habeas corpus

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 failed to allege that he was misled/ that is, that his
2 lawyer didn’t tell him that there was a three-year mandatory
3 parole, and that the court didn’t tell him, are you
4 suggesting that that is a prerequisite to any relief in a
5 case like this, under the Illinois rules?
6

MR. WEINSTEIN;

Well, I don’t know for sure under

7 the Illinois rules, but as I have stated under the Illinois
8 rules, the court will take -- will look at each case on a
9 case by case basis and decide whether or not the failure to
10 admonish was of sufficient importance as to indicate that
11 the plea itself was not knowing and voluntary.
12

We believe that the -- by the way, the Wills

13 decision is not specifically applicable to these cases
14 because Wills was decided in May of 1975.

Both of the

15 Respondents in this case were -- plead guilty in March of
161975, and Wills was specifically made prospective only.
17

Indeed, at the time that these individuals plead

18 guilty, there existed in Illinois a decision entitled People
19 versus Krantz, which had been decided approximately ten
20 months prior to Wills, and in the Krantz opinion, the
21 Illinois Supreme Court indicta indicated that no
22 admonishment as to the mandatory parole term was required at
23 all.
24

The Wills decision overrules Krantz to that extent.
We believe that the appropriate inquiry on

25 collateral attack is not whether an error of law occurred,

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 but rather whether the resulting conviction violated due
2 process.

We submit that in this case it did not.

We

3 believe that the mandatory parole term is not a direct
4 consequence of the plea, since reincarceration comes into
5 play only if a defendant violates the terms of parole.
6

As Judge Tone noted in the Bachner case, the

7 Seventh Circuit decision in Bachner versus United States -8 here we are — "The failure to advise a defendant of the
9 mandatory parole term does not inherently result in a
10 complete miscarriage of justice.
11 parole,

Unlike ineligibility for

the mandatory parole term has no effect on the

12 period of incarceration, and does not ever become material
13 unless the defendant violates the conditions of his parole.
14 It would be as unrealistic, we think, to assume that he
15 would expect to do so and be influenced by that expectation
16 at the time he is considering whether to plead guilty as it
17 would be to assume that he would be influenced by other
18 contingencies he is not advised about."
19

QUESTION:

Mr. Weinstein, I would like to get back

20 to the mcotness point for a minute, since several of my
21 colleagues as well as I seem to be interested in it.

The

22 decision we are reviewing is that of the Seventh Circuit set
23 forth -- which begins on Page 45 of

Yes, Justice Rehnguist.

It does

12 not bind this Court, but the issue was raised in the Seventh
13 Circuit and the Seventh Circuit felt it was not moot.

In conclusion, we believe that if the federal

3 courts are not to grant Section 2255 relief due to a failure
4 to admonish as to the mandatory special parole term, since
5 the error is "neither constitutional nor jurisdictional" in

Court in the Timmreck decision, then they

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

15 the Court, we are talking about a -- just one issue in this
16 case, and that is the fairness of a negotiated plea

to drop.

So in that sense his

2 plea agreement was kept.

3

The court was not a party to that agreement.

The

4 court merely informed him of the sentence, later sentenced
5 him to a term which included mandato ry parole, which he had
6 not

told him about,

but that was not highly relevant in his

7 case as the maximum sentence he got was well within the

Well, you wouldn't think -- would you

7 knew of the special parole term, but the judge didn't advise
8 us of it ?
9

KS. MILLS:

No, I think that would put it in a

10 Timmreck class where it is more of a technical violation.
11 Here they don’t know.

If I recall, and I hesitate to say

12 this because I don’t want to misrepresent anything to the
13 Court, and I mixed up the four petitioners we had originally
14-- there are affidavits from both counsel and judge, I
15 believe, saying that this was a negotiated plea agreement
16 that they all entered into,

and looking at the record, and

17 there was no mention of mandatory parole here.

QUESTION:

I am sure there wasn't a mention of it,

19 but how about knowledge that there was on the part of at

21

KS. MILLS;

22

QUESTION:

That is not in the record.

I thought the

he found out just about a month before he was to be released.

MS. MILLS;

Mr. Williams found out two months

before he was released, when the parole board gave him the

6 terms of his release, and Mr.
7

Southall said that -- he

didn’t say what date he found out, but he did say he found

8 out after the date to appeal had expired.

QUESTION;

I thought therefore, it seemed to me,

10

the record did establish that at the time of the plea they

11

did not know about the mandatory parole.

MS. KILLSi

I assume the public defender had a

2 duty, the judge had a duty, and the prosecutor had a duty,
3 and obviously this is a case in which nobody did it.
4

QUESTION;

5

MS. MILLS;

They all neglected it.
In Timmreck, when Timmreck was

6 sentenced, he was told that there would be a provision of
7 mandatory parole attached to his incarceration.
8 say anything at that time about that.
9 He sat on his rights.

Re did not

He did not appeal.

That was not true in this case.

10 These defendants, petitioners, habeas petitioners, did not
11 know until long after their pleas, plea changes, long after
12 the time to appeal had gone, that there would be a provision
13 of mandatory parole, and they did not sit on their rights,
14 and that therefore changes or makes less compelling the good
15 policy that one would prefer errors to come by direct appeal
16 rather than belatedly by habeas corpus.

Collateral attack

17 is these petitioners’ only remedy.
18

The state argues that this is a technical,

19 procedural sort of defect.

It very definitely is not.

In

20 the case of Mr. Williams, he agreed to change his plea from
21 not guilty to guilty.

He agreed to waive his panoply of

22 rights in connection with the criminal trial in exchange for
23 an agreement entered into by himself, the prosecutor, and
24 the court of a sentence of one to two years.

The plea was an invalid plea because

QUESTION:

Perhaps it is not relevant, but if, as
