First Amendment issues are present which would call for a

2 stricter test.

The Seventh Circuit did not reach that

3 issue, did not apply those issues.
4

So, before the Court today in the briefs. First

6 less rigorous standard,

in

that this is a civil licensing

We do not have constitutionally protected
We do not have a criminal ordinance, and we are

Well,

MR. WILLIAMS:

they said it was vague.

They said it was vague, but they

11

MR. WILLIAMS:

12

QUESTION:

I believe they were.

What if they were wrong that there is

13 at least one object that you can identify?
14

MR. WILLIAMS:

Then I think under what the Second

15 Circuit just came down with in Brockey, that then there is
16 nothing more to review, that the matter goes back, until
17 there is in fact a

real challenge.

QUESTION:

court opinions.

This was written in February

'78, at the direction of the village board to myself.

22 Since then,

as you can see, there has been an explosion of

23 litigation in both state and federal courts.

As draftsman

24 of the ordinance, I had to meet many concerns, of course,
25 not guided by the case law as we now know it.

The first consideration was to determine, should

1

2 we criminalize or should we license because of the
3 proliferation of what we believe was in the rational
4 interest of
5 recognized

roach clips, bong pipes, and the like.

It was

that most of these items are legal in and of

6 themselves,

that there is not, as Justice White states,

7 obviously that

they are illegal.

There are some items, however, that are, so we

8

9 have approached it

two ways, those items that are designed

10 for

use with illegal drugs and those items that are marketed

11 for

use, and of course our emphasis would be on the

12 marketing,

because this is no different than milk, food,

13 flowers, paint, clothing, and

so on.

Every municipality

14 licenses its retailers within the confines of its
15 jurisdiction, and this is regulating at the commercial
16 source.

So we chose not to definitely define each of these

17
18 items.

We chose to avoid those issues even though I think

4 under Virginia State Eoard of Pharmacy and

Pittsburgh Press,

5 that if they did advertise these items, clearly this would
6 not be protected speech, and we could proceed,

and since

7 then, I believe both the Eighth Circuit, Tenth Circuit, and
8 a number of the other federal opinions have found that these

9 are not first amendment issues when they are promoting the
10 sale of these items for illegal purposes.

QUESTION:

Counsel.
Yes.

How do you

draw adistinction

between

15 advertising them for sale and holding them out for sale,
16 except that you have the articulation in the newspaper ad or
17 whatever?
18

MR. WILLIAMS:

The advertisement

goes

to the broad

19 spectrum of the community, and it would be argued as First
20 Amendment expression.

They would argue that the fact that

21 they merely displayed these items together is a form of free
22 expression and free speech.

I believe that in the retail

23 setting, that if you -- these things fall together.
24 find that our language,

If you

"marketed for use with illegal

25 drugs" is not vague, then even if their argument on display

the Carterella case, looked at display

8 courts have just gone right over that issue and not even

addressed was not written by the Drug Enforcement Agency of

12 the Department of Justice until

So this is not to say today that we

14 may prefer to take that particular action that in fact
15 criminalizes this conduct.

In fact, it gives us a stronger

16 control over this proliferation in the community.

But at

17 that time we went with what we had, but I think their
18 argument addresses very clearly the issue of intent in the
19 words "designed for use".

I think there is only one common denominator here,

22 is the one common use that can be used with these items?

24 would be to be used with illegal substances.

7 Tott-Leary presumption that this is more likely than not in
8 this situation, or, Two, take judicial notice that that is

9 what they are selling these items for in the stores when
10 they display them together, when they market them together.

11

One other concern we had by the Seventh Circuit

12 is,

they said, we fear this type of legislation on

13 lifestyles, and I can't make the argument strong enough that
14 I think under the rational interest of the community and the
15 state we have a right to legislate against lifestyles, such
16 as homicidal maniacs, burglars, and drug abusers, and this
17 is one way, a civil remedy to go after a drug abuser.
18

We

don't like his lifestyle in Hoffman Estates, and I don't

19 think anywhere else in the country do they care for that
20 lifestyle, and I believe we have a right to legislate.

I would state that the Hejira versus McFarlane

QUESTION;

10

Well, Hr. Pritzker, what do you do with

11

Justice Holmes' language in the Nash case in 229, where he

12

says that the law is full of instances where a man's fate

13 depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury
14 subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree?
MR. PRITZKER;

15

Certainly that is relevant to other

16 issues which in this case were commented on by the Seventh
17 Circuit, that in fact language does not lend itself to
18 precision.

Certainly, as Justice Holmes noted, there is

19 some amount of looseness, of a lack of precision, that peopl
20 must act in almost all events with a certain amount of lack
21

of certainty as to the significance and the consequences of

22 their actions, but I think

10 there is no intrinsic differences.

11

I think the Sixth Circuit recognized that when

12 they talked about, criticized Judge Kanos for ignoring his

13 own trial record, where even the police agreed with the pipe
14 expert in that case, Mr. Basai, who testified that there are
15 no design differentials between the things ostensibly
16 designated as drug paraphernalia in the enumeration of items
17 in the DEA Act at that time and pipes which are both
18 historically and customarily used and collected and desired
19 by pipe collectors and by pipe smokers.

QUESTION:

What if this ordinance, instead of

21 reading the way it did, had simply regulated the sale of
22 hypodermic needles?

23

ME. PRITZKER:

Illinois has a statute which does

24 that, and probably many states did.

Because, I believe,

25 Your Honor, that we are from an urban area, we assume and

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 automatically associate that hypodermics are unlawful.

In

2 Illinois it is a misdemeanor publishable for up to a year to
3 have or sell without prescription a syringe.

4 pharmacies may dispense them.

So only

However, in North Dakota, and

5 in most livestock-oriented states, they are available over
6 the counter, and in those states they have a tendency and
7 custom to strike hypodermic syringe from enactment of any
8 drug paraphernalia law.
9

QUESTION:

My question was, if the ordinance read

10 as I posited, that the sale of hypodermic needles was

11 unlawful, would you say that was vague?
12

MR. PRITZKER:

13 clearly definable.

No, Your Honor, I would not.

It

is

It lends itself to a clear definition.

14 We know what a hypodermic syringe is.

Then I think its

15 constitutionality must stand like the bamboo paper case, on
16 the overbreadth.

If in fact it reached either some

17 fundamental right, like the need to receive medicine, if it
18 was an outright prohibition as opposed to prescription
19 available, no, that is clear.

Actually, I

9 selected it, and I see now that it was a trial error, but I
10 selected it as evidence because I assumed -- now
11 incorrectly, I

suppose -- that it would be so clear that if

12 a child cannot

possess liquor, would it be unlawful for him

13 to possess a Schlitz glass, a beer mug with the word Schlitz
14 on it?

And since he can’t drink, would it be unlawful for

15 him to have a Johnny Walker Red mirror?

And so I introduced

16 mirrors of various different kinds which were sold at the
17 plaintiff's store, one of which had the word "cocaine" on
18 it, and that was focused upon by the trial court as saying,
19 well, see, it had the word "cocaine" on the mirror, that is
20 drug paraphernalia.

The essence of the decorative mirror

21 has not changed; although I wouldn’t care for it to hang on
22 my wall, it was the expression of their attitude, and
23 certainly many people hold the belief that cocaine should
24 not be unlawful.

7

QUESTION;

Don't you think in Boyce there would

8 have been standing to litigate a declaratory judgment?

9

HR. PRITZKER;

I think that this Court was very

10 clear, and I believe stressed heavily the fact that Boyce,
11

the statute in Boyce was the result of heavy industry

12 participation, and several times in the opening notes,

13 statement of the case, and in its conclusion, the Court
14 reiterated again and again the important role that truck
15 regulations, and that those affected by the statute had in
16 participating in drafting the subject statute.
17
18
19

20

It was in

fact an industry participated bill.
QUESTION;

But that wouldn’t go to standing to

litigate a declaratory judgment.
HR. PRITZKER;

No, but they did not choose to.

21 Instead, they chose to violate the law, and so they violated
22 it at their own risk.

We had standing and yet chose not to

23 violate the law in order to litigate our federal claims, and
24 so certainly if Boyce had had standing, then it would have
25 been a different matter.

McGowan, too.

McGowan didn't have

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to stand in violation of the law and sell items in the
2 department store without going to the beach.

If he had had

3 standing, if there was an imminent threat of enforcement,
4 and he had otherwise complied, then he perhaps could have
5 filed in federal court.

Perhaps it would have been a

6 situation where he would have had to litigate his federal
7 claims in state court, because there was no imminent threat.
8

However, instead he chose to violate the law.

9 They sold stuff on Sunday, didn't bother to litigate their
10 federal claims, and didn't bother to go to the beach.

And

11 certainly somebody maybe shouldn't be responsible, or maybe
12 it's not constitutional to make everybody go to the beach
13 every Sunday to find out what by virtue of popular demand is
14 being sold,
15 not

but he at least should have done it or sue, but

just flagrantly violate the law and say, well, gee, that

16 is vague,

I didn't know I was supposed to go down to the

17 beach, when the statute set it out.
18

In the other cases, for example, in the one case

19 mentioned for display, Danovitz,

in the appellate decision

20 it was clear that as a part of the array, and this is the
21 only case I am aware of where a marketing case was found a a
22 Part of the array, was alcohol, and it is a bootleg case,
23 and so when you talk about the bottles and corks that were
24 present in the Danovitz case, I think it is essential when
25 you read the Feitler -- Feitler died before its

44

QUESTION;

MR. PRITZKER;

Because intent does not give a

just as the example

24 anything to

the detriment of society.

25 intent cannot add

It still does not --

a standard, does not give somebody notice

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 of what is expected of them.
2

QUESTION;

You mean, you think the ordinance would

3 be invalid if it were interpreted as meaning that somebody

4 who sells any of these items which he intends be used with
5 illegal drugs is an invalid ordinance?
6

MR. PRITZKER:

The standard for compliance is the

7 problem, because how is the intent inferred?
8

QUESTION;

Like any other kind of intent.

9

QUESTION;

Like in Screws.

10

MR. PRITZKER;

Well, but again, in Screws, he had

11 the hard conduct from which to -- from which to argue from.
12 He could not argue overbreadth where, first of all, his

13 conduct was such that it clearly was not First Amendment,
14 and secondly, where in fact his conduct was before the
15 bench.

He also had to argue as a merchant does in his

16 situation from his own set of facts, and he could not argue

17 the vagueness in the nature of the conduct.

As I said, the

18 Seventh Circuit talked about the Bence case, conduct
19 unbecoming a police officer, and said, making it intention,
20 intentionally committing conduct unbecoming to a police
21 officer doesn’t aid any standard for adjudication.

As I

22 said in the — well, in the Cohn Grocery case, where it says
23 unlawful to do anything detrimental to the public interest.
24 Would intent add anything to that?

It shall be unlawful to

25 wilfully, intentionally, knowingly, and any other mens ray

find you kick a cat.

Some people think it

3 is wrong, some people don’t think it is wrong.

But what is

5

And assuming that you in your heart think maybe it

7 one know if kicking a cat is wrong or not?

How does

Again, here,

10 enforce it?

11

How does one

Suppose that there were standards --

QUESTION:

Well, that is a separate problem, but

12 it would certainly seem to affect the vagueness argument.
13

MR. PRITZKER;

I submit, Your Honor, it does not.

14 It may affect the first prong of the vagueness standard,

15 that is, standards for compliance.
16 affect the second.

I think that it doesn't

In the First Circuit decision in Smith

17 v. Gogan, they talked about conduct which was outwardly
18 indistinguishable.

19 disdain for the flag, holding the flag over his head and
20 letting it be rained upon.

And doing it out of disdain, as

21 opposed to a Legionnaire filled with grief over having to
22 let the flag get wet, but committing the same conduct, where
23 intent or the action -- certainly you are intentionally
24 holding the flag over your head.
