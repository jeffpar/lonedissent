ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. RICHMOND, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PICHMOND:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court,

the question in this case is the

11 constitutionality

of a New Jersey statute which places

12

unique discriminatory burdens on corporations which are

13 located

entirely outside the state of New Jersey.

On its

the statute involved here is one that simply states

15 that the

New Jersey tolling statute will not run against a

16 corporation

-- unless -- I am sorry -- will not run as long

17 as the corporation

is not represented in the state of New

18 Jersey.

Our position is that the purpose of the tolling

jurisdiction and service of process.

QUESTION;

There is no question

Mr . Richmond , is

3 there, that Searle does business in New Jersey, and is
4 subject to the long arm statute?
5

MR. RICHMOND;

6 Your Honor,

There is no dispute in this case,

that New Jersey does have long arm jurisdiction

7 over G. D. Searle and Company.

That is correct.

There is

8 also no dispute in this case that Searle does not do
9 business within the state for purposes of its qualification
10 sta

te.
Tolling statutes exist in many states, but their

11

12 pur
purpose is to protect a plaintiff against having his cause
13 of action lost as a result of not being able to serve the
14 def
defendant within the state, but the New Jersey statute has a
15 uni
unique and critical difference.

In New Jersey, the only way

16 a fforeign corporation may get the benefit of a statute of
lim
is by registering to do business within the
17 limitations
sta
18 state.

This means that New Jersey denies the statute of

19 limitations

to all corporations that may be served by long

25

MR. RICHMOND;

Yes, sir.

Our position is that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 there is simply no procedure under New Jersey law by which a
2 corporation could appoint an agent for service of process
3 without more.

The plaintiffs—

4

QUESTION;

Does your opposition agree with that?

5

MR. RICHMOND;

No, but the opposition's position

6 is based upon a footnote in the Velmohos case from the New

7 Jersey Supreme Court.

The court was not considering in that

8 footnote the extent of the qualification which would be

9 necessary in order to appoint an agent for service of
10 process.

All the court was doing was addressing the

11 question of whether a corporation could terminate the
12 running of the statute of limitations by appointing an

13 agent, and the body of the Velmohos case makes it obvious
14 that the court was considering that only two kinds of
15 defendants could be exempted from the statute of
16 limitations.

One was the domestic corporation and the other

17 one was the one that was licensed within the state.

As I

18 say —
19

QUESTION;

If there is any question about the New

20 Jersey law here, certainly we can't determine it, can we?
21

MR. RICHMOND;

No, sir.

We agree entirely that

22 the New Jersey Supreme Court has the right to interpret its
23 statute.

However --

24

QUESTION;

25 though?

What about the court of appeals,

Did the court of appeals have anything to say about

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 it?
2

The Third Circuit?
MF. RICHMOND*

The court of appeals, as a matter

3 of fact, adopted obviously the interpretation of the Sew

4 Jersey law by the Supreme Court of New Jersey.

However, the

5 New Jersey Supreme Court was not addressing the point that
6 the respondent here is arguing.

The New Jersey Supreme

7 Court in Velmohos was not stating that in fact the New
8 Jersey statutes permitted a designation of agents for

9 service of process without more.
10

As I say, it was merely that footnote.

The body

11 of the case makes it obvious that what they were addressing
12 was the question of only two exemptions.

One was for the

13 domestic corporation, and the other was for the corporation
14 license in the state, that is, qualified.

Now, many

15 companies, like Searle, may not be sued in New Jersey except
16 under long arm jurisdiction.
17

All they do in New Jersey is

send their products into the state for eventual sale, and

18 they promote the products.

They don't have offices there,

19 other facilities, and they are not doing business there.
20

These companies are subject, however, to product

21 liability suits for — in instances where citizens of New
22 Jersey claim that the products have caused them some harm.

23 Then, long arm jurisdiction is available.

As a matter of

24 fact, in this case, long arm jurisdiction was in fact used
25 to serve process on Searle.

This happened ten years after

1

MR. RICHMOND;

It must be evenhanded, Your Honor

2 It cannot discriminate as this one does merely on the basis
3 of whether or not you are a foreign corporation, and in this

4 instance we believe that the statute of limitations which is
5 here, that is, with the tolling provision as part of it,
6 definitely does discriminate.

The state of New Jersey is

7 perfectly free to adopt a two-year, four-year, ten-year,
8 whatever statute of limitations or none at all if it
9 chooses, but it must do so evenhandedly, and that is our
10 position.

1 argument and on the other constitutional bases as well.
2 Now, what happens in connection with the commerce clause is
3 that this does indeed constitute a heavy burden on
4 interstate commerce because the defendants are placed in a
5 position of having the added expense and the possibility of
6 adverse judgments when New Jersey defendants would not be
7 subjected to those risks.

There is no justification for

8 this discrimination, and every one of the legitimate state
9 interests can be fully accomplished by less discriminatory
10 means.
11

The justification for the tolling statute has been

12 basically on the ground that it makes it easier to serve
13 process, or that there are purported difficulties in service
14 of process for New Jersey residents against unrepresented
15 foreign corporations.

However, when you look at the

16 justifications, we believe that it is clear that they are
17 either fictional or

18

that they are in themselves improper.

The first of these is that it said that it is

19 harder to locate perhaps the out

of state defendant.

20 However, in this case Searle is a Fortune 500 company.
21 There was never any question in this case as to whether or
22 not
23

the defendant could be located.
Furthermore,

the tolling statute really goes too

24 far in that it permits the plaintiff to avoid the statute of
25 limitations indefinitely, even though he does indeed find

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

of the defendant.

yet he would not be subject to the statute of

Also under existing law, as a matter of fact, the

is trying to find the defendant but has been unable to do so.
Finally, I suppose the state could adopt the

8
9
10

As a practical matter, cases are not

statute which tolls only when the defendant cannot be
located.
A second justification of the three -- there are

11
12

three justifications basically which have been used -- is

13

that the statute relieves the plaintiff of his burden under

14

New Jersey rules of satisfying the court that long arm

15

jurisdiction may not -- or that long arm service may not be

16

made within a state and of filing an affidavit to that

17

effect, but the alternative obviously is to ease access to

18

the use of long arm jurisdiction and service of process.
This would lift any burden that the plaintiff has

19

20

without continuing the discrimination against interstate

21

commerce.

22

all could be eliminated, and that would lift some of the

23

burden of the plaintiff.

24

could be adopted whereby elimination of proof to the court

25

at all that service of process by long arm jurisdiction

For example, the requirement for an affidavit at

It could be adopted, a provision

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 isn't possible would be an alternative.
2
3 provision,

I think few, if any, states have this affidavit
probably because its only purpose is -- or the

4 only purpose it really serves is to facilitate harassment of

5 the plaintiff by the defendants in connection with service.
6

The third and last justification for the tolling

7 statute is that it relieves plaintiff of the burden of
8 satisfying the court that long arm jurisdiction or service
9 is consistent with due process.

Respondent is apparently

10 saying that New Jersey has some interest in forcing the

11 defendant to waive its right to due process or in
12 simplifying litigation by eliminating the jurisdictional

13 questions.
14
15 commerce.

This is too heavy a burden on interstate
The burden can't be justified on the basis that

16 the state is relieving the plaintiff of satisfying minimum

17 contact requirements.

This Court in Shaffer v. Heitner said

18 that cost is just too high.
19

None of the justifications raised to support the

20 tolling statute based on the alleged difficulty of services
21 justifies the indefinite tolling of the statute of
22 limitations only against out of state corporations.
23 Requiring plaintiffs to utilize long arm jurisdiction is a
24 far less burdensome alternative to the present tolling
25 statute, but there,

the respondents contend that this is not

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 a burden on interstate commerce at all, this tolling
2 statute.

That is just plain wrong.

It is a very heavy

3 burden, because the corporations are subjected to having
4 their assets and -- placed under constant jeopardy, being

5 subjected to suits and possibly judgments with local or in
6 state defendants would be able to have dismissed on summary

7 judgment or preliminarily.
8

The lower courts never relied on this

9 justification, presumably because they recognized, as this
10 Court has held in cases like Rllenburg, that interstate

11 businesses may not be compelled to register, but the statute
12 effectively requires a registration by the corporation.

13 Indeed, the plaintiff argued in the district court that one
14 of the purposes of the tolling statute was to compel
15 registration by the interstate corporation.
16

The defendant is faced with choices under this

17 tolling statute which we believe to be improper.

On the one

18 hand, it can fail to register, in which case it continues to
19

suffer the burden that has been imposed upon it, and may be

20 paying judgments when other corporations would not have to.

21

On the other hand, it can qualify in New Jersey,

22 but by qualifying, and nothing short of qualification is

23 available, by qualifying, it therefore gives up its right
24 not to be treated as a domestic corporation, and is
25 consenting to any and every suit, whether or not it

I

1 satisfies the minimum contacts requirement.
2

It is subjected also by compulsion to a licensing

3 scheme with all the attendant requirements for maintaining
4 an office, a registered office, filing reports, and paying
5 franchise taxes.
6

We also believe this statute violates --

7

QUESTION

Hr. Richmond, how is the franchise tax

8 computed in New Jersey?

Do you know?

9

I do not know, Your Honor, how it

MR. RICHMONDi

10 is computed.

We also believe that the tolling statute

11 violates the Fourteenth Amendment, and it is a problem in
12 that it requires the corporation to give up its fundamental
13 right under due process not to be sued in the state unless
14 minimum contacts are met, that there is no substantial
15 relationship between this discrimination and any legitimate
16 state goal.
17

I might add that it is important to realize that

18 even if one were to qualify today, it would not cure the
19 harm caused by the tolling statute, because for two years,
20 the statute of limitations period, the corporation would
21 continue to be subject to suits which may have arisen many
22 years in the past and are still viable because of the prior
23 applicability of the tolling statute.
24

We respectfully submit on the basis of the

25 foregoing facts that the decision of the Third Circuit court

17

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Cohn?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER R. COHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6 the Court, the grayjpian of counsel's argument today appears

7 to have shifted greatly from a constitutional argument to a
8 burden because they have to register in New Jersey,

and I

9 submit to this Court that that is not a proper statement of
10 the law of New Jersey.

11

QUESTION:

Well, if it is a burden on interstate

12 commerce, that is a constitutional question, isn't it?

13

MR. COHN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but it isn't a

14 burden, I submit to this Court, because of the fact that
15 just because they have representation in New Jersey, there
16 is nothing in the law and nothing before this Court which
17 says that they must register and become domesticated and
18 become subject to the franchise taxes.
19

The franchise taxes, Mr. Justice, are based upon

20 our gross income of the amount of business done in New
21 Jersey.
22 that.

It is a minimum tax.

And they can be exempt from

There is another section of the New Jersey

23 Corporation Business Act, part of the Act quoted by both
24 counsel and myself, which gives a reporting section, and I
25 know it is not before the Court, but it is the same Act that

18

1 is before the Court.

And in the reporting section, a foreign

3 corporation has the option of exempting itself from any
4 franchise taxes by reporting and by having a representative
5 in New Jersey and by filing a form with the Secretary of
6 State.

It is an amendment to the Act which was passed in

7 1973, and will you indulge me by mentioning it, and permit
8 me to, because of the question raised by the Court today?

10 corporation, can report to the Secretary of State filing the
11 name of their agent, filing the name of their principal
12 office.

The graveman of counsel's argument forgets the fact

13 that the purpose of this tolling statute is so that the
14 plaintiff can find the out of state defendant.

There is no

15 problem on the in state defendant, as counsel says.

They

16 must register with the Secretary of State to file a
17 certificate of incorporation in New Jersey, and they do, and
18 it is a simple procedure to find out the name and the
19 registered agent of an in state corporation.

Just write to

20 the Secretary of State.
21

It is a simple procedure to find out the name and

22 address of the representative of the foreign corporation if
23 there is a representative available, and the very purpose of
24 this tolling statute is to have that representative
25 available so you can find your defendant.

It

4 was fortunate that I could find the defendant here, because
5 it is a well known company.

What about the companies, Your

The small company, which

8 can secrete itself intentionally or not.

The company from

Counsel argues that the tolling of the statute is

11 a detriment to a company because there is no respose.

There

13 into that argument at the present time that I present to the
14 Court the fact that even with a two-year statute, the

In New Jersey, we have many cases on this

1 Jersey
The fact that we have this fixed and fast rule of

2

3 two years is not unique in New Jersey.

We have statute of

4 limitations in the 50 states, and every one is different.
5 New Jersey happens to be one that has a distinction between
6 foreign and domestic corporations with respect to the
7 statute,

and the legislature made that distinction, and I

8 submit to the Court
9 to determine,
10 decision

that is a decision for the state court

as it has in Velmohos, and Justice Pashman's

that that is a proper distinction.
As a result, we have four types of corporations in

11

12 New Jersey when it comes to the tolling statute.

You have

13 your domestic corporation, you have your foreign corporation
14 that

is authorized to do business in New Jersey by

15 domesticating.

You have your foreign corporation that is

16 not domesticated but has a representative, as Justice
17 Pashman

says they must have, and you have the foreign

18 corporation such as Searle that has not domesticated and
19 does not have a

statute.
The legislature has made that decision, and we can

that Searle must have known about it since 1949, the

time the tolling statute was amended by the New Jersey

The legislature did that at the time for a

purpose, and I maintain to this court that that

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reason still remains.

The burden upon Searle or any out of

2 state corporation for registering is one burden.

The burden

3 for having a representative, which is all that is required
4 to stop the tolling of the statute, is another burden so
5 minimal that I maintain that that has not in any way

Let me ask you, what would your

-- responding to Your Honor's question,

19 the domestication of the foreign corporation in New Jersey

20 is not as burdensome as counsel would have this Court
21 believe.

If you do become domesticated in New Jersey and

22 are subject to franchise taxes, those cannot be duplicative
23 taxes.

If Searle files in Illinois, and I don't know

24 whether or not they do -- they are a Delaware corporation
25 with a home office in Illinois — wherever they file they

32

2

QUESTION;

Well, do you think a state could say to

3 a corporation that is engaged only in interstate commerce in
4 New Jersey, that is the only kind of business it does in New
5 Jersey, do you think the state could say, well, we wish you
6 would register, and if you don't we are going to charge you
7 $10 a year?
8

NR. COHN:

I think the state under this statute

9 can say you must have a representative in the state, and
10 even if that representive requires registration to the point
11 of domestication, Your Honor, I think that is not a
12 burdensome event in interstate commerce, because if it is
13 really filing a form, and because of that form this
14 defendant and any other state defendant can obtain the
15 benefit of the tolling statute, then that is a minimum
16 burden that the defendant must bear if they wish to raise
17 this defense.
18
19 Jersey.

They are not prevented from doing business in New
Their argument is that this is a burden.

There

20 isn’t a scintilla of evidence in the record or before this
21 Court that it is a burden.

They have done business to this

22 date and continue to do business, and there is no indication
23 of any loss of business because to our knowledge there
24 hasn't been .
25

QUESTION;

Well, one way it is a burden is that

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

they don 't have the benefit of the statute of limitations.
MR. COHN;

2

There are many reasons that people

3

don't have benefits in a state, and if this benefit doesn't

4

burden interstate commerce, then it is not a burden under

5

the theory of the defendant.

6

if it is, and I only say if it is because of Your Honor's

7

question, because I don’t admit under any theory that they

8

must domesticate in order to have the benefit of this

9

statute, they must have a representative, and Justice

This burden is so miniscule,

10

Pashman in Velmohos is quite clear about that.

The

11

representative can be many types of representatives.

12

only so that you can write some place where everyone knows

13

and find that person who is authorized to accept service.

It is

If you write to the Secretary of State, albeit for

14
15

a registered agent, for a representative, for the person

16

trading as, you can determine that person who can accept

17

process, and thus the defendant will be able to avoid the

18

argument that they have today and avoid the problem they are

19

in.
Presuming that there is any burden, it is so

20
21

miniscule that I submit to this Court that it is not such

22

that you can overturn a statute which can easily be complied

23

with.

There is a companion case

There is the Cumbs Honda case which

14 they are all pending the decision in this case.

QUESTION:

And do all of them sustain the statute?

16

MR. COHN;

So far, this Court is asked to overturn

17 the Third Circuit on the issue,

the New Jersey Supreme Court

18 on the issue, the U. S. District Court, Judge Brockman in
19 the Kelsey-Hayes case on the issue, all cases upholding the

20 statute.

And the only one who did not uphold the statute is

21 my trial judge in my case, and he did it for a different
22 reason.

He stated that the long arm was sufficient to

23 obtain jurisdiction so the statute should not toll.

QUESTION;

Now, I submit that is a very different

The long arm is a court rule.

4 defendant.

The very purpose of the statute is to obviate

5 the situation in the long arm rule instance, where you can’t

7 Jersey, at least have somebody for process, and that is what
8 we are after here, the maintaining of the ability to find

That is the penalty the
