PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments first

3 this morning in Mills against Habluetzel.

Mr. Mankins, you

4 may proceed whenever you are ready.
5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. MANKINS, ESQ.

6
7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MANKINS;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8 Court, the suit today is to determine whether the state of
9 Texas can prohibit.illegitimate children over the age of one
10 year from seeking a determination of paternity and obtaining
11 child support from their natural fathers.
12

This prohibition is found in Section 13.01 of the

13 Texas Family Code, which is a one-year statute of
14 limitations.

Stated simply, a suit to establish the

15 parent-child relationship cannot be filed after the child
16 turns one year old if the child is illegitimate.
17

Now, what Texas has done is to establish two

18 limitations periods; one of one year for illegitimate
19 children, and one of 18 years for legitimate children.

There

20 is no limitation at all for legitimate children, or children
21 born during a marriage.

They can file for child support under

22 Texas law at any time until they turn 18.
23

Now, it is important to note and keep in mind that

24 this 13.01 is the only limitation period that applies for any
25 interest that a child may have in the state of Texas for any
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE. S W. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 1202} 554-234S

1 other kind of lawsuit.

All other limitations involving an

2 interest in children are tolled either by statute in Texas cr
3 by case law in Texas.

Only 13.01 applies to an interest that

4 a child might have.
5

This suit was originally filed by the natural mother

6 of the child# Lois Mae Mills# and the Department of Human
7 Resources against the appellee.

At the time the suit was

8 filed Archie Burton Duncan, the illegitimate child who is the
9 subject of the suit# was approximately 20 months old.

The

10 trial court dismissed the case# citing 13.01 on the — at that
11

time — respondent's motion.

The Corpus Christi Court of

12 Civil Appeals affirmed and did note that the Fourteenth
13 Amendment allegations of the petitioner at the Court of Civil
14 Appeals was meritless.

The Texas Supreme Court refused writ

15 of error and refused to hear the case on a motion for
16 rehearing.
17

QDESTIONi

Counsel, I noticed in the very short

18 opinion of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals on page 16 of the
19 appendix beginning there that simply about one sentence is
20 devoted to the constitutional provision.

They simply say by

21 points of error, such-and-such — TDHR asserts that Section
22 13.01 of the Family Code is unconstitutional, or in the
23 alternative, is tolled by reason of infancy.

"We have

24 addressed these issues and found them to be meritless in the
25 Hernandez case above-mentioned, and based on the reasons set

In Hernandez they don’t either.

MR. HANKINS*

Okay.

The only thing I can say is it

was argued at some length, or was briefed and argued at some

12 length in the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, and that's all the
13 court chose to say about it.

Now, there has been one change, or a major change,
this law since this suit was filed and since it was

16 determined in Texas.

The one-year statute of limitations has

17 been changed now under
18 limitations.

13.01 to a four-year statute of

This went into effect on September 1, 1981.

It

19 does not affect this case in any way, first because Texas has
20 ruled that limitations are a subtantial procedure and that
21 once the limitation has run it becomes a vested right of the

22 defendant to use it as a defense; and secondly, the child in
23 this suit was over four years old on September 1,
24 even if it could have been used,

1981, so

the child here could not have

25 used the four-year statute of limitations.

QUESTION;

And I gather the new statute has no

2 tolling provision, either.

3

MR. MANKINS;

There is no tolling provision.

The

4 only change in the new statute is they deleted the word "one"
5 and added the word "four.”
6

QUESTION*

Now, did you say that the tolling

7 provisions are either by statute or decision?

Those by

8 statute, do they expressly write in the tolling provision,

do

9 they, for infancy?
10
11

MR. MANKINS*

Yes.

It is Article 5535 of the Texas

Revised Civil Statutes that toll all of the limitations found

12 in Title 91

of the Texas Laws.

Title 91 has your two-year

13 statute of limitations for torts, your four-year statute of
14 limitations for written contracts, and all of your general
15 land limitations.

That is a five, a ten and even a 25-year

16 statute.

All of those are tolled under 5535.

17

There are other limitations, such as found in

18 worker’s compensation cases, and under Texas law
19 municipalities can have limitations on suits against cities
20 written into the municipal code.
21

tolled by common law.

Those limitations have been

The Texas Supreme Court has ruled that,

22 for instance, in worker’s compensation cases where a minor has

23 a worker’s compensation claim, that the six-month limitation
24 there is tolled because of past cases and by public policy.
25 It is only 13.01 which is not tolled.

QUESTION*

Hr. Hankins, would it be your position

2 that a longer statute of limitations than the one year might
3 be

valid?

4

HR. HANKINS*

Well, one year — if you look at what

5 legitimate children can do,

which is file at any time up until

6 they are no longer minors, which is 18 in Texas.
7 done this by making it four years now.

Texas has

But since there is no

8 tolling provision, the difference between four years and 18
9

years — I still say all of the arguments are still the same

10 and really feel that there is no real difference, since we
11

have a difference.

12

Texas, for children, can make any kind of limitation

13 period they

want.

The problem is they have made one for

14 legitimate children and another one for illegitimate children.
15

QUESTION;

Can you think of any reason why they did

16 that?
17

HR. HANKINS;

Well, the only reason we have is what

18 the Texas courts have said, and

this is the standard reasons

19 that first-year law students learn, and also,

the standard

20 reasons that have been cited in other states that have upheld
21 these type of limitations for illegitimate children.

That is,

22 prevention of stale and fraudulent claims.
23

There are no other reasons —

MR. MANKINS*

No.

In Texas it is presumed that the

the marriage.
QUESTION*

And you don't think that that difference

is enough to justify the statute of limitations, of any kind.
MR. HANKINS*

Well, I don’t think it is, mainly

because first, the blood test evidence which I think this

8 Court recognized the validity of in little v. Streater decided
9

in June of last year, plus the fact that you've got the

10

situation, which has happened in Texas, where under Texas law

11

a husband, a father, of children born during a marriage can

12

disclaim paternity at any time during a divorce proceeding,

13

and show, through blood test, that he is not, in fact, the

14

natural father of the children or the child of the marriage.

15

Under Texas law, if the child is over one year old

16

and now over four years old, that child is without a remedy to

17

go against his true natural father and obtain child support.

19

QUESTION*

Tell me, Mr. Mankins, those statutes that

you said tolled during infancy, this by legislation, would

Illegitimates on any other type of

sir.

QUESTION*

In other words, the limitation without

tolling is limited to a paternity suit, is that it?
MR. MANKINS*

Only in paternity suits —

QUESTION*

In every other respect, there would be

2 tolling in favor of the illegitimate.
3

HE. HANKINS*

That is right.

If the illegitimate

child was struck down by a car, the two-year limitation for

torts in Texas would not start running until that child turned

6 eighteen.

QUESTION*

Hr. Hankins, do I correctly understand

MR. HANKINS*

Yes, Your Honor.

Are they waiting for this Court, or

But whether that is correct or not, I have no idea.

2

QUESTION*

What is the normal pattern in that court

3 in terms of the time?

Do they normally get all their opinions

4 out before they arise?

HR. MANKINS*

6 quicker than that;

They are determined generally much

90 days to six months, I have been told.

7 do not have extensive experience even in the Texas Supreme
8 Court.

Much quicker.

The cases I have had up there have been

9 decided quicker than that.
10

QUESTION*

11

MR. MANKINSt

You are not in the Ft. Worth case?
No, Your Honor.

Under a strange

12 interpretation of the Texas Supreme Court's rules on

taking

13 conflicts, our case, even though the Ft. Worth case was
14 decided just shortly after our case was decided and before our
15 case had gotten — we were already past the Court of Civil
16 Appeals in Corpus Christi, had filed our writ in the Supreme
17 Court of Texas, but we could not claim conflict under the
18 Texas Supreme Court rules.

The Ft. Worth case conflicted with

19 us, but our case does not conflict with theirs.
20

21

QUESTION*

Can you tell me whether there was a

challenge to the statute under the Texas Constitution in that

22 case, or is it just the federal question?

2 Fourteenth Amendment.
3

QUESTIONS

This case is stiled in the Court of Civil

4 Appeals "In the Hatter of A.B.D., a Minor Child."

And one

5 gets the impression from reading it, being unfamiliar with
6 Texas procedure anyway, as I am, that the Texas Department of
7 Human Resources was the plaintiff.
8

MR. MANKINS;

Hell, the Department of Human

9 Resources, by both federal law and state law, they were
10 supplying support.

Archie Burton Duncan and his mother were

11 receiving AFDC, $86 a month in the state of Texas, and when
12 you receive AFDC both by federal law and state law, which has
13 been enacted, automatically any rights to child support are
14 assigned by law to the state.
15

QUESTION*

And the state must bring the action.

16

MR. MANKINS*

And the state must bring the action.

17 Well, the mother could theoretically bring the action by
18 herself, but generally, in an AFDC case, it will be the state
19 who will bring the action.
20

QUESTION*

Did you represent the Texas Department of

21 Human Resources in the state proceedings?
22

MR. MANKINS*

Not in this proceeding.

I worked for

23 the Department of Human Resources in this area and filed
24 numerous suits exactly like this.

Then I switched jobs and

25 went to work for Coastal Bend Legal Services with an office in

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

Sinton, and I was familiar with this case.

And because the

2 Texas Constitution prohibits anyone but the Texas Attorney
3 General from representing the case on appeal,

I took over the

4 case on appeal for the Department of Human Resources.
5

QUESTION4

Isn't there something of a parties

6 problem there?
7

HR. MAHKINSi

8

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

Well, if your client, Lois Mae Mills, was

9 not a party before the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, can she
10 then step in and be a party in this Court?
11

MR. MANKINS:

Well, she was a party at the Court of

12 Civil Appeals.
13

QUESTION:

14 understand.
15

Well, that is probably what I don't

She was a party as well —

MR. MANKINS*

16 original petition,
17 parties.

She was a party.

In fact, in the

both her and the child were named as

Under Texas law, these are confidential cases until

18 there is a final decree, and at the request of either side
19 and I do not know who requested — well, I

—

believe it was the

20 appellee here — this case was styled "In the Interest of
21

22

A.B.D."
Now, this case is the 16th case, I believe, that

23 this Court has heard involving the rights of illegitimate
24 children since

1968.

Now, this Court has, in these cases,

25 basically determined that where a state attempts to restrict

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the rights of illegitimate children and where these rights are

2 fundamental personal rights, then the state must shew some, as
3 this Court has said, significant interest or significant
4 relationship to be served.
5

In other words, the rule seems to be under the

6 Fourteenth Amendment that we are going to look behind the

7 words and look at the reality of the situation.

The reason

8 being that the state is seeking to restrict what is
9 fundamental personal rights.

Clearly, the determination of

10 paternity, the establishment of paternity and the obtaining of
11
12

child support is such a fundamental personal right.
Texas can discriminate against illegitimate

13 children, under the Fourteenth

Amendment.

But in order to do

14 so, it must have some awfully good reason for doing so.

In

15 other words, we are not going to let states simply use any
16 reason that comes to mind in order to foster a classification
17 or a disfavored class of illegitimate children.

And clearly,

18 a very short limitation time does not serve the purposes of
19 illegitimate children, and in fact, it hinders their obtaining
20 child support and getting their paternity determined.
21

QUESTION &

Did I get the impression from what you
a

22 said earlier that any limitation short of

18 years would be

23 unconstitutional?
24

MR.

MANKINSi

No, I don't.

I think, once again,

25 Texas can establish any limitation it wants for obtaining

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

child support.

I think it could establish for legitimate and

2 illegitimate children.
3
4
5

It's the fact that we have two of them

here that is the problem.
QUESTIONi

That is what I'm talking about, just this

case for illegitimate children.

Do I understand you to say

6 there cannot be any statute of limitations short of age 18?
7

MR. MANKINS:

I think as long as its legitimate

8 children have that right until 18 I think illegitimate
9
10

children should have that right.
QUESTION*

I think that is correct.

Mr. Mankins, do you also have an argument

11

that in any event, illegitimates are discriminated against

12

only in parternity suits?

13

MR. MANKINS:

14

QUESTION:

I think you already told me —

That is —

And in every other kind of suit where a

15

legitimate may benefit from tolling, a minor benefit from

16

tolling, so also does an illegitimate.

17

MR. MANKINS:

18

QUESTION*

19

That is correct.

It is only in this particular kind of

proceeding that there is a discrimination against the

20 illegitimate.
21

MR. MANKINS:

22

QUESTION*

23

That is right.

So it's more than just a discrimination

as between legitimates and illegitimates, isn't it?

24

MR. MANKINS*

25

QUESTION:

Well, that is correct.

It is within the class of illegitimates

there's also a discrimination, you contend.

2

MR. MANKINS;

That is correct.

If having this

3

limitation is important, -- and in Department of Human

4

Resources v. Chapman which said this was a valid law for the

5

reason that we are going tc prevent stale and fraudulent

6 claims — if that was so important an interest that the state

7 needed to protect, the question, of course, is then why isn’t
8 it important in any other case?
9

Why is preventing stale and

fraudulent claims so important here when it is not important

10

in a worker's comp case, when it is not important in an

11

automobile wreck case, in effect

12

an illegitimate has an interest in land?

QUESTION;

Well, the problem with that is that

paternity is probably — paternity suits are probably better

20 at withstanding time as far as evidence is concerned, the
21

stale evidence argument for restricting these cases, because

22 of the availability of blood tests.

Here, the blood test --

23

that is very good evidence and it lasts as long as you've got

24

blood in your veins, and they can do these blood tests at any

25

time.

3

MB. NANKINS*

Well, it is a negative test, but the

They are expensive but they are

With that kind of evidence, the evidence itself in

8 the case does not become stale.
9

Plus, in paternity cases, generally blood test

10 evidence is the only real objective evidence you ever have.
11

The question is did the alleged father have sexual relations

12

with the natural mother nine months before the birth of the

13 child.
14

And then, is he the father of the child.

Whether or

not he had sexual relations with the natural mother is

you don’t have any other

witnesses whose memories are going to fade, who are going to

18 get lost,

and you are not going to be losing any sort of

19 documentary evidence.

20

If anybody is harmed by the passage of time, it

21

would be the natural mother and the child themselves, but

22 clearly, they have the burden of proof, and if there’s going
23 to be any evidence that is lost,

it is going to be their

24 evidence.
25

QUESTION*

Would you agree that the state could
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

rationally require the plaintiff in this case to have a

2 heavier burden of proof than the plaintiff in a case of
3 establishing paternity by a legitimate parent?

In other

4 words, in the legitimate case, presumably you could say that
5 all he has to do is prove that the person who was

married to

6 his mother is — that the male was married to his

mother, and

7 that would be sufficient to establish paternity.
8

But in this case, could the state rationally say

9 that in addition to proving that the two parties were living
10 together at the time of birth, or prior to the birth, that
11 they had certain other things that had to be proved?

Would

12 that be constitutional?
13

MB. MANKINS;

I would say it would not be.

Clearly

14 it makes a better situation because it is going to be easier
15 to prove.

But once again, what interest would that serve in

16 having a higher burden of proof in an illegitimate case
17 proving paternity as opposed to a case where the father of an
18 illegitimate child is trying to disprove paternity?

It seem

19 to me the proof is —
20

QUESTION;

I suppose the answer to that might be

21 that common experience teaches us there is a greater
22 probability of accuracy in one situation than the other.

They, in talking about tolling generally and about

13 limitation in paternity anyway.

Implying that estoppal, which

14 would also defeat the policy of limitation in paternity, would
15 also not apply.
16

But Texas, unlike other states, does not have any

17 estoppal clause in their limitation period.

Well, why isn’t it in the case?
Because only the one-year applies to

MB. HANKINS:

Nell, they would have to read the

3 year — certainly, I think if the one year is

5 is the same situation all over again.

Why have a limitation

6 of four years when there is no other limitation involving the
7 rights of children or illegitimate children in any other kind
8 of lawsuit.
9

QUESTION:

Is there another reason why the four-year

10 statute is before us?

The statute of limitations is an

11 affirmative defense; did your opponent plead the four-year
12 statute of limitations as a defense in this case?
13

HR. MANKINS:

No, because it didn't — it wasn't the

14 law.
15

QUESTION:

How can it be before us?

16

MR. MANKINS:

That is what I'm saying — it is not

17 before this Court at this time.

But my argument is that even

18 though it is not before the Court, certainly, if the one year
19 is unconstitutional, for all the same reasons the four year is
20 going to be unconstitutional.

Why have the four year statute

21 here when you don't have a limitation for anybody else.

And,

22 of course, the evidence for four years is just as good 36
23 months later as it would be after one year.

It gives

5 that illegitimate child an opportunity to qualify for social
6 security benefits in the event of the death of the worker
7 holding a social security account number.

It likewise gives

8 that illegitimate child an opportunity to establish paternity
9 for the purpose of becoming entitled to worker's compensation,
10 to life insurance policies and those kinds of things.
11

Now, this avenue in Texas was not available to an

12 illegitimate child until September 1, 1975.

It was this

13 Court's mandate in a support case entitled Gomez v. Perez, but
14 it goes far beyond enabling an illegitimate child to enforce
15 support.

It does other things.

16

Appellant takes the position that a legitimate child

17 in Texas can enforce support at any time until it attains the
18 age of 18 years, under our Texas law.

So can the illegitimate

19 child if it will take the step to prove paternity.

If the

20 illegitimate child takes that step and establishes paternity,
21 then it, too, may enforce support until it attains the age of
22 18 years.
23

QUESTION*

Now they can do it over a span of four

24 years — establish paternity.
25

MS. BONNEB*

That is correct, establish paternity,

1

which is a necessary prerequisite in illegitimacy.

2 how do you enforce support?

Otherwise,

Do you enforce it against all of

3

the men of the world, or must you not establish this is the

4

proper father, biological father, from whom I am going to seek

5

my support.

6
7

Now, the Texas legislature did not limit the right
of the trial to bring this suit within the one-year period of

8 time to establish this paternity.
9

It obviously gave the Texas

Department of Human Resources the right.

It gave anyone who

10

had an interest in that child the right to bring the suit,

11

including the father.

12

Now, on September 1, 1975, we had our first —

13

QUESTION:

14

Who would the father sue in such

litigation?

15

NS. BONNER:

16

QUESTION:

17

NS. BONNER:

18

To establish paternity?
Yes.
He may establish paternity voluntarily

by going into —

19

QUESTION:

That doesn't require a lawsuit.

20

NS. BONNER:

21

QUESTION:

Well, but he may —
And he can do it more than one year after

22 the child was born, couldn't he?

NS. BONNER:

23
24

correct.

25

blood test.

Yes, he could waive that.

Yes, that is

And incidentally, I want to touch on this, about the
Now, I know nothing about the blood test.
35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

All I

1

know is what I read from the opinions rendered by this Court.

2 But it is my understanding that a blood test does not show
3

that you are the father; it simply shows that you are not the

4 father.
5

Now, at that point, you must proceed on other

6 evidence.
7

If the one-year statute is held to be

unconstitutional by this Court, then we revert to pre-1975

8 law, which is governed by Gomez v. Perez, and in the case of
9

the Texas Department of Human Resources v. Delley, that court

10 has held, and so far as I know or believe,

this is the law —

11

that a pre-1975 child has until four years passed, attaining

12

the age of 18.

13

So that a child in Texas, should this one-year

14 statute of limitations be held unconstitutional, may wait
15

until they are 21 years,

11 months old, and file the suit to

16 establish paternity.
17

Now, if that blood test does not show that the

18 alleged father is not the father,

then the case proceeds on

19 other evidence.
20
21

QUESTION;

Well, how does that help the child here?

It doesn’t help the child involved in this case.
a

22
23
24

MS. BONNERs

It wouldn't help any child, because his

right to support has —
QUESTION.*

Well, if you say that this child was

25 bound by the one-year statute and therefore has no cause of

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 action, are you saying that that child can, 18 years from now,
2 say that it is?
3

MS. BONNERi

Only if this Court says that that

4 one-year statute of limitations which governed this case is
5 unconstitutional.
6

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

I thought you said just the

QUESTION*

Just to clarify this a little more, if

7 opposite.
8

9 this Court were to rule the one-year statute of limitations
10 invalid, then the appellant would be able to proceed to
11 establish paternity.
12

MS. BONNER:

13

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And then thereafter, conceivably could

14 seek, support from the father if paternity is established.
15

MS. BONNER:

16

QUESTION:

Right.
And you are still asserting the one-year

17 statute of limitations as a defense on behalf of your client.
18
19 yes.

MS. BONNER:

I did at the trial level of this case,

The trial of this case was never heard on the merits.

20 Paternity wasn’t even mentioned.

The case was dismissed

21 because it was barred by a statute of limitations.
22 on the merits was held.

No trial

Which is the reason I requested in

23 the Texas court that the style be changed to "In Re:

A.B.D."

24 in lieu of the manner in which appeal was taken to the United
25 States of America, because — and counsel pointed out the fact
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 1202) 554-2345

1

that these cases are confidential.

2 with that.

I respectfully disagree

We have my client's name all over the pleadings in

3 these cases which are very public.

There have been articles

4 in our state concerning this very case, naming my client,
5 against whom paternity has never been established.
6

But walking further in the proof of these cases

7 where the blood test does not show that the father is not the
8 child, what man has kept records for 21 years and eight months
9 which could possibly disprove that the mother of the putative
10 child had access to him, or vice versa?
11

QUESTION:

It would be unlikely you would have a

12 21-year old suing for support, isn't it?
13

MS. BONNEB:

14 16-year old.

That is correct.

But if you had a

In one of the cases in which I am presently

15 involved we have a three-year old.
16

QUESTION:

You were referring to the other

17 consequences; rights of inheritance and so forth, which might
18 be worth a great deal more than the support.
19

MS. BONNER:

20

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

Are you saying in your earlier remarks

21 that essentially, this is not a support case; this is just
22 another paternity case, and that the support is simply a
23 collateral consequence of the results of the paternity case.
24

MS. BONNER:

No.

This is a support case.

I am

25 suggesting that Article 13.01, the statute being attacked, is
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 1202) 554-2345

1

not a support statute.

It is a paternity statute.

And our

2 state legislature has said fine, to illegitimate children we
3 will afford

you an opportunity to establish paternity.

Now,

4 once you do that you are entitled to support, inheritance,
5 social security benefits, worker's compensation and on and
6 on.

Which is the point I was attempting to make.

7

We take the position that the state legislature has

8 the right to set a limit, a time limit, on the right of the
9 illegitimate child or its mother or the TDHB or anyone else
10 interested in the child to bring that.
11

have more than 12 months anyway.

12 months.

And obviously, you

You actually have 21

Dnder our statute, the suit to establish paternity

13 may be filed before the child is born.
14

Now, there is a provision that if that happens, then

15 the blood test for the child should be made after the child is
16 born.

But a woman is going to know that she is enciente long

17 before the nine-month period of time has expired.

So in

18 addition to that nine months, then she has the one-year period
19 additionally, because the statute, subject of this case, says
20 that a suit to establish paternity may be brought within —
21 must be brought within one year from the date of the birth of

22 the child; otherwise, it is barred.
23

QUESTION*

In any event, you do concede that the

24 statute was the Texas legislature's response to Gomez against
25 Perez.

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

MS. BONNER*

I think I would have to say that is

2 true.

3

QUESTION*

To that extent, it’s a support statute.

4 To that extent, anyway.
5

MS. BONNER*

6 other things.

I think that's true, but it does do

It does do other things.

It provides an

7 illegitimate child an avenue.
8

In attempting to look down the road as to what might

9 happen, I would hate for our state to end up with a situation
10 where we have discrimination among the class,

that class being

11

known as illegitimates.

12

1, 1981, an illegitimate child has four years in which to file

13 the suit.

For example, from and after September

If this Court holds that Texas did not have the

14 right to set a one-year statute of limitations in paternity
15 matters, holds it unconstitutional, under the existing Texas
16 law, that child will have until four years after it attains
17 the age of
18

18.
So you have one illegitimate child who has four

19 years to bring the suit, and you have another illegitimate
20 child

who has until they are 22 years of age to bring the suit

21

22

QUESTION*

Well, Texas can enact another statute to

23 take care of that, can't they?
24

MS. BONNER*

Yes, they could.

And frankly, I

25 anticipated the question, why do you think the Texas

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 12021 554-2345

1

legislature said one year at first and now it is saying four.

2 And the only answer that I can give is that you know the
3

thinking minds of the legislators better than I, and we have

4

all seen in our lifetimes that when a new act or a new law is

5

effectuated or promulgated and enacted, they start off

6 somewhat easily, and then perhaps bear down.
7

We see that more

frequently I think in the tax field than we do in fields like

8 paternity.
9

QUESTION*

Your opponent argued that the four-year

10

statute had run and that he would be barred for one reason or

11

another if he went back.

12

he surely has, under the one-year statute, do you believe the

13

four-year statute has already run on him?

14

MS. BONNES*

But if he has a pending case, which

I do.

Even if our Texas courts gave

15

retroactive effect, which I believe they will, to the new law,

16

the new four-year statute, it would cover children born from

17

and after September 1, 1977, that this case would, at that

18

point, be barred because of the birth of this child in

19

February of 1977.

20
21

QUESTION*

Even though the suit was brought within

the four years?

22

MS. BONNES*

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

That is just my opinion.

Ms. Bonner, do you know anything about

24

the Miller case?

It is the situation challenged under the

25

Texas Constitution as well as the United States Constitution.

mentioned.

Article 1 of the Texas Constitution is

However, the case was decided on discrimination

3 under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
4 Constitution, but not because of illegitimate children.

That

6 because it was a paternity suit and not a maternity.

7 was no provision for a maternity suit.

result, it was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment
