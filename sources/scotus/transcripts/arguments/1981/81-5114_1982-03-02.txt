Mr. Beller, you may proceed

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. BELLER, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. BELLER:

7

8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

9

I received the briefs, both the brief of the

10

United States as amicus curiae and the answering brief

11

from the State of Florida.

12

been misstated in the answering brief for the State of

13

Florida.

14

constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy

15

precludes retrial of the Petitioner where the appellate

16

court, acting as a thirteenth juror, assessed the

17

credibility of the witnesses and re-weighed the

18

evidence, concluding that although the evidence was

19

sufficient as a matter of law to sustain the verdicts,

20

the Petitioner should be afforded a new trial.

21

I think the question has

The question that they cite is whether the

I think the question is just pure and simple,

22

as stated in my original brief, whether or not the

23

double jeopardy applies where the Court has grounds for

24

retrial under the double jeopardy clause because of the

25

fact that the court originally weighed and found the

evidence insufficient to convict the Petitioner
QUESTIONi

2

3

Mr. Beller, where is Mr. Tibbs

now?

4

MR. BELLER;

Mr. Tibbs is in Chicago.

He was

5

-- on the motion to dismiss, the case was discharged.

6

He was out on bond at that particular time, but of

7

course the bond would then be dropped.

8

QUESTION;

But he is not incarcerated now?

9

MR. BELLER;

No, he is not.

10

The question of double jeopardy, as opposed to

11

weight, is presented in the Government's brief as amicus

12

curiae, and they say it would affect Rule 33 of the

13

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

14

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applies to the trial

15

court, who in effect is sitting as a,thirteenth juror,

16

because the trial court does see the evidence, does see

17

the witnesses, weighs the credibility of the witnesses.

Rule 33 of the

I don't think anything that this Court does in

18
19

the Delbert Tibbs case should have any effect upon Rule

20

33.

21

sitting as a thirteenth juror -- that’s the trial court,

22

not an appellate court — has the same opportunity as

23

the parties who are the jurors to weigh the evidence.

24

And if the trial court feels under Rule 33 that there

25

should be a new trial, it orders a new trial in the

I think that's a good rule.

The trial court

interest of justice

2

Now, what happened in this particular case is

3

that the appellate court of the State of Florida, the

4

Supreme Court, who is the direct court of appeals in a

5

murder trial, under Rule 9.140 of the Florida Pules of

6

Criminal Procedure — or Appellate Procedure -- (f), did

7

review the case and reviewed the totality of the case,

8

did, as it is required to do, did a total review of the

9

evidence.
And I'm sure the Court is aware of the various

10

11

points of evidence that it did review.

12

was this.

13

It didn't use that phraseology.

14

evidence was — there were insufficiences in the

15

evidence.

16

then it went on to list —

It said that this evidence is insufficient.
It said that the

There were things about the evidence.

QUESTION*

17

But what it did

And

Did they not say in effect there

18

was not enough evidence here for the jury to reach the

19

verdict that it reached?
MR. BELLERs

20

Correct.

They concluded that

21

there was not enough evidence for a reasonable man to

22

conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant

23

was guilty.

24

evidence.

25

And that's weighing the sufficiency of the

And they concluded by saying, rather than risk

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the very real possibility that Tibbs had nothing to do

2

with these crimes, we reverse his conviction and remand

3

for a new trial.
Now, this happened prior to this Court's

4
5

decision in Burks and Greene, and there was a concurring

6

opinion by Justice Boyd at that particular time, who

7

said, I believe that this man should not be retried, but

8

under the current law he probably can be retried.

9

and Greene, if my understanding of them is correct, said

Burks

10

simply this:

that where a trial court — where an

11

appellate court reweighs the evidence and finds that the

12

evidence is not enough to convict beyond and to the

13

exclusion of every reasonable doubt, that it’s the same

14

as finding that there is insufficient evidence and that

15

he cannot retry them under the double jeopardy clause.
QUESTION:

16

Hr. Beller, I thought the trial

17

court simply made a determination that in the interest

18

of justice the Defendant should have a new trial.

19

pointed out seven so-called weaknesses in the state's

20

case and then said there should be a new trial.

21

that so?

22

MR. BELLER:

They

Isn't

When they reviewed their initial

23

decision, yes, they said there should be a new trial.

24

But that was prior to Burks and Greene, and Burks and

25

Greene simply set up the proposition that you did not

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

waive the right to the double jeopardy clause by asking

2

for a new trial.

3

that if you applied to an appellate court for a new

4

trial and the court granted you a new trial, it was

5

simply doing what you asked for and you had waived your

6

right to the double jeopardy clause when you got your

7

new trial, even if it was a question of evidentiary

8

insufficiency.
And the problem here is, what did they reverse

9
10

I think previous to that the law was

on.

They did set up a series of nine various
l

11

deficiencies, and they all go to evidentiary weight.

12

None of them go to any question of a legal

13

insufficiency, whether or not he had admitted something

14

improperly,

15

that should have been excluded.

16

raised.

None of these were

So it was a question of whether or not the

entire evidence was sufficient to convict.
QUESTION*

19

Well, in their second opinion they

20

certainly take a different view of what they did in

21

their first opinion than you do.
NR. BELLER;

22

Let me apply it to the second

23

opinion.

The second opinion, through the fifth section

24

of the second opinion — in fact, when I read the second

25

opinion — and you'll find that the dissenting judges

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

all concur in it through Roman numeral number V, their

2

fifth section, which is the majority of the second

3

opinion.

4

The second opinion reviews the District Court,

5

the Second District Court of Appeals opinion, which said

6

that he should be retried because the reversal was not

7

based on insufficiency, but was based on weight of the

8

evidence, that though there was enough evidence to

9

legally convict Tibbs, yet because of the weight in the

10

interest of justice they felt he should have a new

11

trial.

They went through and reviewed it, the

12

13

majority in the second opinion, and they said, well,

14

weight and insufficiency are so close we're never going

15

to do that again.

19

the evidence is tenuous or insubstantial.

21

reversal as based on evidentiary weight should be

22

reconsidered in light of our decision today, and under

23

the doctrine of Burks and Greene any retrial of those

24

cases may or may not be barred on the basis of former

25

jeopardy."

In fact, quoting from their second

"Henceforth, no appellate court should reverse a

QUESTION*

Well, let me call your attention to

2

page 22 of the Joint Appendix, which is part of part

3

five of the court's second opinion, down at the bottom

4

of the page where they says

5

cannot fairly conclude from our original opinion that

6

Tibbs* convictions were reversed on the grounds of

7

evidentiary insufficiency."

8
9

"The fact remains that we

Now, don't you agree that at- least the second
time around in interpreting their first opinion they

10

said that they had not reversed for evidentiary

11

insufficiency?

12

MR. BELLERs

I would agree with that.

What

13

they said is that they're never going to do it again.

14

But what they said is that in this particular case they

15

had reversed on the weight.

16

no Supreme Court cases that establish weight versus

17

insufficiency.

18

Now, there really have been

And as I said, through paragraph five — I

19

thought, in fact, when I read the case through number

20

five, I thought I had won the case.

21

were going to let Tibbs go.

22

concurring opinions — the dissenting opinions, they all

23

agree through paragraph five, because the court does, it

24

dissects — dissects; pardon me — the original

25

application of weight versus insufficiency, and says

I thought that they

And if you look at the

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it's too hard to determine.
In fact, they went through — if you look at,

2

3

and I'm sure you have — but they went through and

4

delineated all the cases in Florida that had used the

5

weight theory and said that they were very tenuous, and

6

that most of these cases were reversed on insufficient

7

evidence, and therefore, as I said before, they then

8

concluded that no court should reverse on the weight

9

again.

10

However, they left in effect Rule 9.140(f) of

11

the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, and that rule

12

says:

13

any relief to which any of the parties is entitled in

14

capital cases.

15

capital case -- the court shall review the evidence to

16

determine if the interest of justice requires a new

17

trial, whether or not insufficiency of the evidence is

18

an issue presented for review."

"In the interest of justice, the court may grant

In capital cases" — and this was a

But then they went on to say that if a court

19
20

does under 9.140 review the insufficiency of the

21

evidence to determine whether or not it's sufficient and

22

reverses — and this is, I'm quoting from 21, the second

23

paragraph.

24
25

This is from the Joint Appendix:
"With respect to the special mention of

capital cases in the second sentence of the rule, we

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

take that sentence to mean no more than that an

2

additional review requirement is imposed when

3

insufficiency of the evidence is not specifically raised

4

on appeal -- namely, that the reviewing court shall

5

consider sufficiency anyhow and, if warranted, reverse

6

the conviction.

7

to bar retrial under the double jeopardy clause."
They're saying if a court does review the

8
9

The consequence of that action would be

sufficiency of the evidence it would bar it.

Now, I

10

raised this point in my brief and I think it's important

11

to raise the point, because it's a question of

12

interpretation of what the court originally said.
The three dissents here, the three justices

13
14

that say that the evidence was insufficient, and there

15

is a very -- and I quoted extensively from Justice

16

Sundberg's opinion in my brief, because I think he said

17

it better than I can.
But the three justices there were part of the

18
19

original majority that had reversed for a new trial.

20

There was only one justice of the original majority that

21

didn't join in, and the reason he didn't join in is

22

because he wasn't on the court, as far as I could

23

determine.

24

course.

25

And nobody can read the man's mind, of

But what I'm saying is that the people who

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

wrote the opinion — Justice England, who wrote the

2

opinion, the original opinion, said in the interest of

3

justice we should let him go.

4

applying — and he did quote Rule 9.140(f).

5

doing is saying, under Rule 9.140(f), as the majority

6

said here, we reviewed the evidence, we found it

7

insufficient, therefore double jeopardy bars a retrial.

8

In the interest of justice he should not be retried.

9

What he's doing is

And he did it very shortly.

What he's

Justice Englander

10

in his dissent said, I agree with the court through part

11

five.

12

I agree with the court through part five, too.
Justice Sundberg in his dissent started out

13

with saying, I agree with the court through part five.

14

Because through part five the court says, we shouldn't

15

use the standard of weight or insufficiency, because

16

weight is too tenuous.

17

they do come to the conclusion in this particular case

18

that they had made an error, that they had used the

19

standard of weight rather than insufficiency.

20

And then they finally come --

And they said we could do three things.

21

could vacate our original order and say that we

22

shouldn’t have reversed and sustain the original

23

conviction.

24

could release him.

QUESTION;

Well, I suppose one of the

3

questions is whether that is an appropriate remedy for a

4

reviewing court, is it not?
MR. BELLER;

5

Sure.

I really do not think that

6

the first option is a viable option, where they could

7

say at this late date their original conviction should

8

stand .
QUESTION;

9

I’m just talking about the second

10

alternative that they took.

11

least the arguable suggestion that they were sitting as

12

a jury?

13

MR. BELLER;

Are they not open to at

To a certain extent, I think

14

every court sits as a jury, though the law — and they

15

fairly pronounce what they consider law now.

16

we should not sit as a juror, we should not do — we

17

should just determine whether as a legal matter the

18

evidence was insufficient.

19

did determine, because, just to give you a brief resume

20

of the case, because I know this Court is familiar with

21

the briefs, this was a one-witness case.

MR. BELLER;

QUESTIONS

1

Don’t we have to accept what the

2

court said that it did?

3

the question and say that the Florida court did

4

something else, are you?
MR. BELLER:

5

You're not asking us to reweigh

I’m asking you to determine what

6

the Florida court did in the original Tibbs decision in

7

the light of Burks and Greene, which is the subsequent

8

decisions of this particular court.
QUESTION:

9

Well, I thought you were asking us

10

to say that if a conviction is set aside because it's

11

against the weight of the evidence that we should apply

12

double jeopardy to it.

13

saying is that we should re-examine this whole question

14

for the Florida court to say they did something other

15

than what they said they did.
MR. BELLER:

16

But what I think I hear you

Whether they call it weight or

17

insufficiency, if the court ruled on the evidence and

18

didn't rule on any legal point other than just the

19

evidence, that brings it within the double jeopardy

20

clause.
QUESTION:

21

Well, what do you do in the case

22

where the trial court simply sets aside the verdict and

23

grants a new trial, sitting as a so-called thirteenth

24

juror ?

25

MR. BELLER:

I think that's a different

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

situation, because the trial court is a thirteenth

2

juror.
QUESTION:

3

Well, but within a system of state

4

procedure certainly the appellate court can decide it

5

will sit as a thirteenth juror too, can't it?
ME. BELLER:

6

Under Rule 9.140 the court has

7

left itself that option.

It says they should never

8

reverse — review the weight of the evidence.

9

again, the Florida Supreme Court has set out what it can

But then

10

do.

It said under Rule 9.140(f), if we do review the

11

evidence and determine that it's not enough, then they

12

say the consequence of that act would be to bar retrial

13

under the double jeopardy clause.
What we’re saying is the original court didn’t

14
15

know Burks and Greene.

Burks and Greene came

afterwards.

than the factor that there was a so-called confession to

Mr. Beller, may I ask, Justice Boyd

not ?

11

MR. BELLER:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
And certainly in the second

13

go-around in his dissent he took the position clearly --

14

or I’m asking whether he did — that his vote was on

15

insufficiency.
MR. BELLER;

16

20

Well, there's no question about

QUESTION;

So it gets down to what the three

of the plurality of the first go-around held.
MR. BELLER;

What I’m saying is that the

original majority have all said that their vote was on

earlier meant?

MR. BELLER:

I certainly think they did.

And

18

certainly -- let's not lose sight of one particular

19

aspect of the double jeopardy clause.

20

exactly what the double jeopardy clause means to me, is

21

that the state doesn't get a second bite at the apple,

22

that the state, if it doesn't have sufficient evidence

or enough evidence or the weight of the evidence at the

first trial — whatever you want to call it, but the

25

court says it has to be enough evidence to convince a

the double jeopardy feature.

QUESTION:

10

And I'm sure they feel

Mr. Beller, when a court gives a

11

new trial to a Defendant because the conviction is

12

against the weight of the evidence, isn’t the court

13

merely granting the Defendant a second opportunity to

14

get an acquittal?

15

double jeopardy has to apply, wouldn’t you preclude

16

state court judges from, in the interest of justice,

17

giving a Defendant that kind of an opportunity?

And if your rule were adopted, if

MR. BELLERi

18

The Supreme Court of the State of

19

Florida said it didn’t do that in this particular case.

20

It said, we specifically reserve the right under Rule

21

9.140(f) to grant new trials in the interest of

22

justice.

23

under 9.140(f) we reweigh the evidence, then double

24

jeopardy applies.

25

they said, and I’m not sure that they’re clear in what

Then they went on to interpret it and say, if

At least that's my thinking of what

They said, but we don't preclude an appellate

court granting a new trial under Rule 9.140(f).

And

14

then they went on to say that if they do consider the

15

sufficiency of the evidence under Rule 9.140(f), in

16

light of Burks and Greene they would have to say that he

could not be retried.
There was no other consideration, no other

Suppose an appellate court, suppose

Double jeopardy?

Under that supposition, granting

the rule and not knowing what the court’s consideration

motion that I made before the trial court now.

22

3

they did say was, we reversed on weight in this

4

particular case, though we’ve never done it before, and

5

we’re never going to do it again.

6

QUESTIONS

And what

Well, Hr. Beller, isn’t that

7

logical to believe that it’s true, where you have a

8

situation where the evidence in the case consisted of

9

the testimony of the eyewitness victim, hardly

insufficient as a matter of law?

11

the court of appeals said, we didn't believe her?

Reading the cold record, we just don’t believe here.

13

We’re going to weigh it differently.

14

Isn’t it a case where

But that isn’t insufficient evidence as a

15

matter of law, is it?

MR. BELLER:

might be, unless there’s some even very faint

corroboration.

the court went into, the fact that there wasn’t the

vaguest point of corroboration other than her story, and

23

that there were reasons to judge her story suspect, not

the least of which was the factor that she made an

I think that most cases that have held

but that strikes me as almost the classic example of

fruits of a poisonous tree.

by the court, not as a major reason for the reversal,

6

but as the reason to suspect Nadeau’s testimony, to find

7

that her testimony wasn't completely within the bounds

of the law, that it was based on a faulty exhibition of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

QUESTION;

No, but my question was, assuming

2

they correctly summarized the law and you agreed with

3

it, before this decision and after this decision, would

4

it be constitutionally permissible to have this case be

5

decided on the weight of the evidence, whereas all other

6

cases like it have been decided on sufficiency grounds?

7

MR. PALECKI:

Well, one thing I think

8

throughout the country I would say pretty much

9

universally — perhaps there are some exceptions — the

10

courts throughout the country for the last century have

11

been saying appellate courts should not reweigh the

12

evidence.

13

it’s one of the elementary principals of appellate law.

14

And we learned this in law school.

You know,

Yet, time and time again appellate courts do

15

reweigh the evidence.

16

read dissenting opinions of this Court where the dissent

17

says the majority here reweighs the evidence.

18

also this Court has written majority opinions saying

19

that the dissent is reweighing the evidence.

20

It*s a matter of fact.

I have

I believe

So we have an area of law which it appears

21

that very often courts try to dodge or evade, and courts

22

are continuously reweighing the evidence, even though

23

they say that they aren't.

24

the State of Florida in this particular case perhaps is

25

not clear that the courts can't reweigh the evidence.

But in any event, the law in

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And I would refer the Court to the opinion of the Second

2

District Court of Appeal, which is in the appendix,

3

where the Second District Court of Appeal cites at least

4

ten cases in the State of Florida where appellate courts

5

had reweighed the evidence.

6

is that there is a bulk of caselaw in Florida which has

7

the effect of saying that in Florida the appellate

8

courts up until that time can reweigh the evidence.

So the fact of the matter

Now, in this case not only did the Florida

9
10

Supreme Court rule that Tibbs* reversal was not based

1.1

upon evidentiary insufficiency; the court ruled that it

12

had improperly reweighed the evidence and described

13

Tibbs* reversal as an appellate reversal improperly

14

entered.

15

it reweighed the evidence and has described its earlier

16

decision as an appellate reversal improperly entered.

17

So the Florida Supreme Court has conceded that

And the court went on to states

"We could

18

simply apply the principles enunciated in today’s

19

decision, vacate our previous reversal, and affirm

20

Tibbs’ conviction."

21

an acquittal here; it should not even have been a

22

reversal, according to the Supreme Court of Florida.

23

So not only was Tibbs’ reversal not

Here retrial does not give the State a second

How long under Florida law do you

QUESTION:

Suppose he goes back and he's tried

again and the 12 jurors find him guilty, he goes up to

doubts.

Can they send "it back again?

12

SR. PALECKIs

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, Your Honor, they can.

How long?

My question is, how long

can that go on?
MR. PALECKI:

15

Well, I would answer that

16

question by referring the Court to its caselaw on hung

17

juries.

18

say when there is a hung jury there can be a retrial.
QUESTION:

19
20

MR. PALECKI:

25

That's true, Your Honor, there

is no verdict.
QUESTION:

23
24

Yes, but then there is no verdict.

That's quite a different situation.

21

22

This Court has written several opinions which

And there's been no determination

at all.
MR. PALECKI:

But in this regard the hung jury

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case is closer to one terminating in an acquittal than

2

the case where the appellate court reverses, despite the

3

technical sufficiency of the evidence.

4
5

QUESTION;

You mean it's a hung jury because

the thirteenth juror is holding out?
MR. PALECKI:

6

It's very analogous to a hung

7

jury, because the appellate court as a thirteenth juror

8

is merely saying, we disagree with the other twelve

9

jurors.

So in that case, in that way, it is very

10

analogous to a hung jury.

But as I stated earlier, the

11

situation of a hung jury is even closer to an acquittal

12

than in the case where an appellate court reverses

13

despite the technical sufficiency of the evidence.

14

Because after a hung jury the prosecutor knows his case

15

has not led to a conviction, whereas in the case here

16

the prosecutor knows that his case has led to a

17

conviction and that the twelve jurors have believed the

18

Defendant Tibbs was guilty.

19

I would cite this Court — excuse me.

20

I would argue that in this situation it is

21

Tibbs who gets the proverbial second bite at the apple

22

and not the State of Florida, because Tibbs gets to go

23

in front of a jury again and perhaps Tibbs can be

24

acquitted the second time.

25

QUESTION;

Where did Tibbs get the right to

2

HE. PALECKI;

3

QUESTION;

Well —

That was your phrase.

I never knew

4

we required anybody to prove their innocence.

5

that was the Napoleonic Code.
MR. PALECKI;

6

I thought

Well, Your Honor, that was a

7

slip of the tongue.

8

that Tibbs will be found innocent by the — found

9

innocent by the jury in his second trial, not that he’ll

10

Perhaps I should have used the word

have to prove his innocence.
QUESTION;

11

Well, I don't think that the

12

average citizen is required to have a jury to declare

13

him innocent.

I thought he was presumed a little bit.

MR. PALECKI;

14

Well, at this time he is

15

presumed innocent, because the Florida Supreme Court has

16

reversed his conviction and said that Tibbs starts off

17

on a clean slate.
QUESTION;

18

And if he’s presumed to be

19

innocent, he doesn’t have the right to prove his

20

innocence.

21

22
23

HR. PALECKI;

That’s correct. Your Honor, and

he does not have to prove his innocence.
In upholding the Massachusetts dual tier trial

24

system, this Court held that nothing in the double

25

2

secure an acquittal.

3

in this case.

4

And that's merely what I'm saying

Under Burks, the Defendant will go free only

5

when the prosecution's failure is clear.

Petitioner

6

requests a drastic broadening of Burks to cover the

7

situation where not only isn't failure clear, but where

8

there is no failure at all, because here the Florida

9

Supreme Court has said that its reversal was improperly

10

entered, that they made a mistake and they should never

11

even have reversed it in the first place.
So in this case there has been no failure at

12
13

all , and to extend Burks to a situation where there has

14

been no failure at all is completely uncalled for.

15

this —

16

QUESTION:

Is it your position that the

17

opinion in the first case by the Supreme Court is

18

vacated totally, or is it merely modified?

19

Now,

HR. PALECKI;

Well, they state that we could

20

simply apply the principles enunciated in today's

21

decision, vacate our previous reversal, and affirm

22

Tibbs' conviction, but they chose not to do so.

23

felt that Tibbs would be prejudiced by doing so because

they've already told Tibbs he can have another trial and

25

they're going to let him have the second trial.

decision, its previous — it reweighed the testimony in

22

its previous decision, and that this was not a case that

23

was overturned based on evidentiary insufficiency.

In this case the

proposition that the Supreme Court of the United States

QUESTION;

6

Here

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that

if they had stopped there we wouldn't have any of the

10

problems that we have right here, because the facts are

11

very clear that Cynthia Nadeau on two occasions

12

specifically identified Mr. Tibbs in the courtroom,

13

pointed to him and said, that is the man that raped me,

14

he is the man that murdered Terry Milroy.
She testified that Tibbs shot Milroy in the

15
16

back, that he then went over to Milroy, who was pleading

17

for his life, pleading, don't shoot me again, and said

18

to Milroy, does it hurt, boy, are you in pain?

19

after he was done taunting Milroy he dispatched him with

20

a single bullet to the head.

Finally,

Thereafter, he went on to rape Cynthia

21
22

Nadeau.

There was the testimony of the doctor that she

23

did have sperm in her vagina.

24

corroborating testimony of Tibbs' jailmate, who

25

testified that Tibbs had told him he committed the

murder and went into some detail, stated that he, Tibbs,

2

had told him that he was driving down the road in Fort

3

Myer when he saw a couple hitchhiking, and he mentioned

4

the name of the road, Cleveland or Fowler.

5

Tibbs told his cellmate that he, on the

6

pretense of running out of gas, he went out into a field

7

where there was some farm machinery, presumably to

8

siphon gas out of it.

9

had offered the fellow money if he walked off; that

Tibbs' cellmate said that Tibbs

10

Tibbs told him that he pulled out his gun and told the

11

dude to start running; that Tibbs told him that he shot

12

the dude that was running; that Tibbs said that he had

13

sex with the girl and walked over and shot the dude

14

again; that Tibbs said he was fixing to kill the girl,

15

but she swayed him not to by telling him she would be

16

his woman; and finally, that the girl jumped out of the

17

truck and that a car was coming at that time, so he had

18

to get going.

19

So in detail Tibbs' cellmate gave the story of

20

the crime, and it corroborates on many points with the

21

testimony of Ms. Nadeau.

22

QUESTION;

Did his cellmate explain what

23

happened to the truck?

24

MR. PALECKI;

25

He testified that Tibbs had told

him that the truck had run out of gas between Fort Myers

If there is any question at all that the

11
12

Florida Supreme Court didn't act in good faith here,

13

that their second opinion was merely a ruse used in

14

order to get by Burks, I think it's clear that that's

15

not the case, because the Florida Supreme Court in a

16

similar case, McArthur v. Nourse, just some weeks before

17

this case had ruled that Burks applied.

18

case they said they had based their opinion upon

19

insufficiency.

Because in that

So the Florida Supreme Court — there's no

showing that the Florida Supreme Court used its second

22

opinion as a means of somehow evading the Burks

23

opinion.

whatsoever to be precise in your language concerning

evidentiary insufficiency, because Burks broke with a

2

long line of precedent reaching all the way back to

3

1896, United States versus Ball.

4

So there was no reason for the Florida Supreme

5

Court to believe in the first case that this question

6

would ever arise.

8

saying, this is what we meant, and being precise with

9

our language here now that we know what Burks is the

10

law, this is what we meant when we came out with our

11

first opinion.

And I don’t see any problem with the

Now, the Petitioner incorrectly analyzes

12
13

United States v. Scott in his brief, and comes up with a

14

nice neat test, that there are two categories:

15

reversals based on fact, which means there must be an

16

acquittal; and the other is reversals based on trial

17

error, under which case there cannot be an acquittal.

But the Petitioner fails to recognize the

18
19

distinction between a dismissal at trial and a reversal

22

the defendant not guilty, whereas on appeal we know that

2

test used in Burks, because the test in Scott does not

work on an appellate reversal, because every appellate

4

reversal based upon facts isn't necessarily an

acquittal.

6

In Burks this Court said that an acquittal

So for these reasons, the nice neat package we

14

have in Scott, where we have two categories — reversal

15

based upon facts and reversal based upon trial error —

16

does not work on an appeal situation.

17

situation we must have two different categories.

18

have — and this is, I think, supported by Burks —

19

those categories are reversals based upon evidentiary

20

insufficiency and-every other ground for reversal.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. BELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

7

MR. BELLER;

Well, just shortly, Your Honor,

8

the State has brought up the District Court of Appeals

9

review of various courts.

I would call the Court’s

10

attention to the joint appendix, page 16, in which the

11

Supreme Court of Florida reviewed all those cases that

12

the appellate court brought up and said they all were

13

reversals on insufficient evidence, in the concluding

14

paragraph.

MR. BELLER;

18

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
Suppose during the argument the

19

court said, we have concluded there’s enough evidence to

20

affirm the conviction, but we think maybe in the

21

interest of justice we would grant a new trial if you

22

want one.

23

affirm the conviction.

24

But if you don't want one, why, we’ll just

Could the state put that to you, fairly put
that to you, without violating the double jeopardy

cla use?

2

MR. BELLER*

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

3

think that's the problem that this Court faced in Greene

4

and Burks, the old problem of, if you ask for a new

5

trial you waive your right to double jeopardy.

6

Certainly any defendant faced with the possibility of

7

either affirmation of a conviction or a new trial will

8

take the new trial, if the court put it in that blunt

9

words.

10

QUESTION:

All right, suppose you took it.

11

And then you think you should win a motion, then, in the

12

trial court based on double jeopardy grounds?

13

MR. BELLER:

Because subsequent this Court

14

said that’s exactly what we should win, that we don’t

waive our rights to new trial — pardon me, I may have
