CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

We will hear arguments

first today in the case of the United States against

4

Ross.

Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10

may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of

11

certiorari for the United States Court of Appeals for

12

the District of Columbia Circuit, which reversed

13

Respondent's conviction on the ground that certain

14

evidence should have been suppressed.

15

heroin found in a paper bag seized on probable cause

16

from the trunk of Respondent's automobile and searched

17

without a warrant.

The evidence was

18

So the issue in this case is whether police

19

officers who possess probable cause to search a paper

20

bag found during the lawful search of an automobile must

21

procure a search warrant before examining the contents

22

of that bag.

23

I think this divides itself into two

24

sub-issues, first, in general, whether a paper bag is a

25

container of the kind to which the warrant requirement

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

applies, and secondly, assuming that it is outside an

2

automobile, whether the requirement applies when it is

3

discovered in the course of a probable cause search of

4

an automobile.

5

I don't usually employ visual aids in my

6

arguments before this Court, but I think in this case it

7

is important not to stick solely to abstractions, so I

8

do have a paper bag which resembles, although it is not

9

the actual bag that was involved in this case.

Now,

10

what this case is about is whether the Fourth Amendment

11

requires officers who needed no warrant to arrest

12

Respondent, no warrant to carefully examine the

13

passenger compartment and glove compartment of his car,

14

and to unlock and search its trunk, to stop their search

15

upon coming across a paper bag like this, which they

16

have probable cause to believe contains heroin, to carry

17

the bag carefully to the courthouse, to spend several

18

hours preparing and presenting a warrant application to

19

a magistrate before they may open the top of the bag and

20

look inside.

21

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, can I ask a question

about the visual aid?

23

MR. FREY:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

Is that bag stapled together?

25

MR. FREY:

No, it is not.

QUESTION*

1

2

Would it make any difference in

your argument?
MR. FREY*

3

Well, I am sure that I would

4

contend for the same result, for a number of reasons

5

which I will get to, but it is potentially a relevant

6

consideration, because the steps that may have been

7

taken to preserve an interest of privacy have some

8

bearing, in my view, on the application of the warrant

9

requirement.

I think stapling a paper bag together

10

would clearly be insufficient to activate the

11

requirements.
Now, I would like to make some preliminary

12
13

observations —

14

QUESTION*

What could you do with it?

15

MR. FREYs

Excuse me?

16

QUESTION:

What could be done with it if

17

stapling is not enough?

18

MR. FREYs

With a paper bag?

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MR. FREY*

Well, I am not sure that anything

21

could be done with a paper bag that would be sufficient

22

to --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, that is really your position,

MR. FREY:

Well, that is — that is our

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

position, but in order for us to prevail in this case,

2

it is not necessary for the Court to decide the

3

exceptional case in which a paper bag were stapled,

4

taped, marked "Private contents, do not open," and so

5

on.

6

unsuitable container to maintain substantial privacy

7

interests that the costs of the warrant requirement are

8

not justified, but that would present an exceptional

9

case, and I think that what is before the Court today

10

must be judged in terms of the general class of cases

11

involving searches of containers that ordinarily are not

12

used as a repository for highly private or personal

13

effects.

14

We would still argue that the paper bag is such an

Now, I wanted to make a couple of preliminary

15

observations, and the first is that search and seizure

16

issues generally have two facets.

17

substantive inquiry into the amount and quality of the

18

justification the police must possess before they may

19

conduct a search, and the second is the procedural

20

inquiry into whether a warrant should be required as a

21

precondition to the search.

22

The first is the

Now, without denegrating the importance of the

23

warrant in appropriate cases, I submit that the

24

substantive requirement in cases like this, probable

25

cause, is the far more important protection in
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

safeguarding basic Fourth Amendment values.

2

case, it is conceded that the substantive requirements

3

were satisfied by the existence of probable cause, so

4

the only question is whether the additional procedural

5

prophylaxis of the warrant requirement is appropriate in

6

this context.

7

QUESTION:

In this

Nr. Frey, could I ask you, just

8

while you are — so I can keep it in mind while you go

9

along, suppose what they were hunting for was, say, a

10

waffle iron, a stolen waffle iron, or something else

11

that couldn’t go in the paper bag.

12

probable cause to search the car for the waffle iron,

13

but if you got to the paper bag, you wouldn’t be

14

searching it, would you?

You might have

NR. FREYi

No, and I want to make —

police can look in paper bags any time they feel like

We are not saying that a paper bag, as

QUESTION:

But you have to have probable cause

to look for what can go in a paper bag.
NR. FREY:

The scope of your search is

determined by what you are looking for.

In this case it

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2024 554-2345

1

was reasonable to look, for heroin in a paper bag.
Now, the second preliminary point I wanted to

2
3

make is that the question here is not whether the

4

lawfulness of the search will be subject to judicial

5

review, but simply the timing of that review.

6

will it occur by a magistrate before the search or will

7

it occur in some other forum after the search, a

8

suppression hearing or a Bivens action.

That is,

Also, without wanting to belabor the point, I

9
10

do want to remind the Court that it is really beyond

11

serious dispute that neither the language nor the

12

history of the Fourth Amendment directly supports the

13

imposition of a warrant requirement in a case like

14

this.

15

created one designed to implement the reasonableness

16

requirement of the first clause of the Fourth Amendment.

17

The warrant requirement is rather a judicially

I say this not as a criticism of the judicial

18

imposition of a warrant requirement, because I believe

19

that the Court has correctly perceived that it is

20

ordinarily unreasonable to permit certain kinds of

21

searches to proceed solely on the basis of the judgment

22

of a police officer.

23

What I hope to persuade the Court today is

24

that any inquiry into the wisdom of ruling certain

25

classes of searches unreasonable per se in the absence

of a warrant depends on a consideration of the extent to

2

which the warrant requirement serves the basic purposes

3

of the Fourth Amendment in the particular context.

4

requires weighing the benefits that may be derived from

5

the warrant requirement against the costs that are

6

associated with the procedure, and the analysis that we

7

espouse for assessing the value of the warrant procedure

8

is precisely that employed by the Court for determining

9

the procedures required to satisfy due process in

the decisions of this Court have essentially identified

that the warrant limits the scope of the search by

already been seized, the area of the search is quite

practical way to limit the scope of the search inside

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Frey, that does assume

that you could hold the bag.

15

MR. FREY;

Yes, it is a —

QUESTION;

MR. FREY;

You could not have a meaningful

of the item.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, on the Sanders case, is

8

it your position that we have to address the question of

whether Sanders was retroactive in this case?

MR. FREY:

No, we have not raised that issue.

11

That issue was in the case.

MR. FREY:

I don't believe that Sanders

7

QUESTION:

And why not?

8

MR. FREY;

Because of the difference between

9

luggage and insubstantial containers of the type we are

10

arguing about here.

11

QUESTION:

And do you take the position that

12

we should deal then and adopt some rule based on the

13

worthiness of the container?

15

MR. FREY:

Do you think that is

Hell, I wouldn't use that

16

particular rhetoric in describing it, but I do think

17

that it is desirable, and I hope to show in my

18

argument —

19

QUESTION;

Is that more desirable than

20

addressing ourselves to whether any article contained in

21

an automobile when you have probable cause for the

22

search can be searched?

23

MR. FREY;

Well, that — that would be an

24

alternative line of analysis that three Justices have

25

employed in dissent in line with Sanders.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

2
3

QUESTION;

Is that a better approach than to

examine the worthiness of the container, in your opinion?
MR. FREY;

Well, in my -- as I analyze the

4

case, I think, it is logically prior to decide whether

5

the container is a kind that is generally entitled to

6

the warrant protection before deciding whether the fact

7

that it is found in the course of an automobile search

8

justifies a warrantless search, and I think the reason

9

why I take that position is because in my view the

10

outcome of the automobile search issue might very well

11

depend on the outcome of the other issue.

12

If the Court's conclusion were that only a

13

small category of containers, to wit, luggage, attache

14

cases, containers inevitably associated with an

15

expectation of privacy, have the protection of the

16

warrant clause if they are found on a sidewalk or a park

17

bench or a restaurant table or some place like that,

18

then that seems to me that it would affect the analysis

19

of the automobile search issue, because it could be

20

argued that those items have substantially greater

21

privacy protection than the automobile itself, and there

22

would — against that framework, there would be some

23

logical basis for refusing to apply the automobile

24

search exception.

25

QUESTION;

Well, given the fact that you have
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

an automobile search exception, and that you can reached

2

closed containers even in a locked glove compartment of

3

a car, is there a logical distinction then between that

4

and a closed container in a trunk?
ME. FREYi

5

No, but I take it the rule as to

6

searching that closed container would be the same

7

whether it was located in the glove compartment or the

8

trunk.

9

I must say that — that Justices Blackmun and —
QUESTION*

Do you think Belton allows

10

currently that you could search the article in the

11

12

MR. FREY:

Well, I view Belton as presenting a

13

completely different issue, because the search there is

14

not justified by probable cause.

15

substantive justification for the search, and therefore

16

I don’t think that it necessarily sheds light on the

17

appropriate rule when you are not dealing with a search

justified by some quantum of particular suspicion —

I was going to get to

this a little later, because of the way my analysis was

that he could be arrested, he was arrested, he could be

taken with the bag to the place where he was to be

19

searched him, legally, and there would be no Fourth

20

MR. FREY:

Well, there —

QUESTION:

can just consent to their looking in the bag if he is

innocent, and that is what the Court suggested in the

footnote in Sanders, and it has been suggested

13

elsewhere, but if you were the chief of police or the

14

United States attorney, and you were instructing your

15

agents on what to do in an important case when they had

16

seized a container that they believed, let's say, had 20

17

pounds of cocaine in it, whether or not to accept the

consent, I think you would be most hesitant before

telling them to accept a consent, because if it does

have the cocaine in it, you can be sure that in 95

percent of those cases you are going to have a

Is there a difference, Mr. Frey, in

MR. FREYs

Well, there is a difference, but I

— I have to say that in applying the cost benefit

analysis, the difference in cost between two to four

22

hours of a couple of officers being off the street

24

not all that great.

costs of a warrant requirement are substantial.

QUESTION;

7

I take it that the basic point you

8

are making is that if you can search the interior of the

10

in what we call the interior of the car, there isn't a

11

logical reason why that should not be extended and

12

enlarged.

13

MR. FRET;

That is an important -- that is

14

part of our argument, or in a sense the lynchpin of our

15

argument in terms of looking at precedent, which is that

16

the Court has — in the past, the results that the Court

17

has reached have been dependent on the Court's

18

evaluation of the magnitude of the expectation of

19

privacy in the area that is to be searched.

20

automobiles, as the Court explained in Chadwick, in

21

contrasting automobiles to luggage, the privacy interest

22

is significantly less in automobiles than in luggage,

23

and that is why the Court held that a warrant is

24

required for luggage and not for automobiles.

In

before you can impose a warrant requirement on

containers is whether there is any substantial basis for

saying that a container is more private than the locked

QUESTIONi

5

Are there problems being created in

the application of the rules that we are discussing here

by the change in the structure of automobiles/ that is,

8

the hatchbacks, the newer types of cars where they do

9

not have a trunk which is distinct from the rest of the

10

11

interior?
HR. FREY:

Well, I think that would be

12

relevant in search incident cases, but I don't think it

13

is relevant in investigative search cases, because the

14

Court's rules clearly allow a full search of all

15

portions of the car, so whether you had a hatchback, a

16

station wagon, or a conventional sedan with a closed

17

trunk, the rule still is that you don't need a warrant.

20

QUESTION:

Well, under Belton — under Belton,

what is the limit of the search?
MR. FREY:

In Belton, the limit of the search

21

is the area within the reach of the arrested individual

compartment of the car.

As I say, I think it is relevant in

10

terms of the permissible scope of search incident to

11

arrest, but if we are talking about an investigative

12

search on probable cause, and whether a warrant is

13

required, after all, for a search incident you don't

14

need probable cause.

15

warrant requirement has nothing to do with search

16

incident to arrest.

That is one of the reasons the

In any event, let me get back briefly to the

17
18

benefits of the warrant procedure, because I think it is

19

very important for the Court to have in mind the limited

20

extent to which those benefits apply to searches of

21

insubstantial or low privacy containers.

22

the particularity benefit there is also the notice

23

benefit.

25

has been judicially authorized.

In addition to

That is, the warrant provides notice to the

Again, in the case of the container search,

2

the search on the spot is the only one that the

3

defendant is likely to observe.

4

to be locked away in a cell, and the search won't even

5

take place in his presence, and the notice function is a

6

pretty insubstantial function in the context of

7

container searches.

8
9

Otherwise, he is going

Now, there is a third function, and it is, I
think, the most important one, and the only one that is

10

relevant here, and that is that when the warrant

11

procedure is working properly, it will guard against

12

unjustified searches by overzealous police officers who

13

mistakenly believe they possess probable cause.

14

value of this benefit, I submit, is inescapably tied to

15

the privacy interest that is generally associated with

16

the thing or the place to be searched.

17

The

In those areas where society attaches high

18

privacy value, the home or office, mail, telephone

19

communications, the damage to Fourth Amendment interests

20

caused by an unjustified search are high, and

21

accordingly the prophylaxis of the warrant procedure, if

22

it succeeds in preventing even a few unjustified

23

searches, is well worth its cost.

24

But, I repeat, the value of the warrant

25

requirement here is solely a product of the costs
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

associated with the unjustified search which is going to

2

be prevented.

3

unlikely to contain anything very private, the costs of

4

a mistake in the search are dramatically reduced.

5

If the search is of an area that is

For example, in Robbins, if the officer had

6

been mistaken in believing that the parcel contained

7

marijuana bricks, and instead had found that it

8

contained highway flares, as one judge suggested it

9

looked like, the costs of the officer seeing the highway

10

flares in terms of an invasion on Robbins’ personal

11

privacy would have been relatively slight.

12

This is also true in cases involving, for

13

instance, burlap bags full of marijuana, which might

14

turn out to contain straw if the officer is mistaken,

15

and generally in cases of containers, grocery bags and

16

other things that don’t ordinarily contain highly

17

private items.

18

Now, against these very limited benefits when

19

we are talking about container searches, we have to

20

weigh the costs in terms of two respects.

21

governmental resources consumed in the warrant

22

procedure, and again, I — it is very easy to pooh-pooh,

23

as the ACLU has done in its amicus brief, the costs of

24

the warrant procedure as though they were a moderate

25

convenience, like having a remote control to turn on and

that nature.

substantial period of time while they get a warrant, and

5

I think it is the duty of this Court not to require

6

those kinds of procedures unless it is satisfied that

7

some substantial protection of Fourth Amendment

8

interests is going to be derived from it.

It is a matter of taking working law

The second is the point that I have already

9
10

discussed with Justice Marshall, which is even the

11

interests of the innocent suspect are not well guarded

12

by this rule, because that individual may be subject to

13

a custodial arrest lasting some hours before the

14

magistrate decides there is not probable cause and

15

orders him released, and I suspect that, to use the

16

greater intrusion, lesser intrusion analogy, most people

17

would vastly prefer an immediate search if you are

18

dealing with a low privacy container than they would the

19

alternative of arrest, seizure, warrant procedure, and

20

so on .

21

Now, in view of the time, I think I will sit

22

down now if there are no further questions and reserve

23

the rest of my time for rebuttal.

MR. GARBER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

please the Court, on behalf of the Respondent, our

4

position is succinctly that the circuit court was

correct in invalidating the search in this case, and

that the circuit court's opinion has been reinforced by

7

this Court's judgment in Robbins versus California.

QUESTION:

Suppose, Mr. Garber, that when they

actually opened and tested this container, this brown

10

paper bag, and found that it was just powdered sugar and

11

nothing else, or some other innocuous subject, or

12

substance, how much damage has the -- have the privacy

13

interests of the person been impinged?

would that be, if they have made a mistake?

that Ross in this case was initially arrested on a

So, in this particular case, even if the

substance had turned out to be an innocuous substance,

Ross still would have been in custody by virtue of the

When they opened the trunk, not

13

at that point, because we would have to concede, and of

14

course the main thrust of our argument is that at that

15

point there may have been exigent circumstances for

16

conducting a search of the vehicle on the scene, but

17

that once they had opened the trunk, and after Ross had

18

been in custody, and they observed — they didn't

observe contraband in plain view, at that point the

20

exigencies were gone.

Well, they were still looking for

They were still looking for contraband.

QUESTION;

Well, they were still looking when

7

they opened the paper bag, but I don't understand, very

8

frankly, why in — under your analysis it is all right

9

to open the trunk, but it is not all right to probe

10
11

around in the trunk and open bags and things.
MR. GARBER;

Because, as we stated in our

12

brief, and as we -- as we attempt to argue here, the

13

violation of the Fourth Amendment occurs at a point

14

where the exigent circumstances cease, and the exigent

15

circumstances ceased at the point where Ross was in

16

custody,, the vehicle was in custody, and the officers

17

did not find the fruits of the contraband until they

18

were able to open the container on the scene.

19

Now, at that point, we submit that both the

20

vehicle and its contents should have been removed, and a

21

warrant applied for.

22

Now, the government takes the position that

23

there is a cost involved in obtaining a warrant.

Hr. Garber, would you agree that

QUESTION;

23

MR. GARBER;

24
25

Right, and it — okay.
-- and that would be a search

QUESTION;

And if it had been in the locked

glove compartment, the police could have opened the bag

2

and examined the content.

3

MR. GARBER;

4

QUESTION;

Correct.
All right, and just because there

5

is some little partition between the back seat and the

6

trunk, there should be a different rule.

7

MR. GARBER;

Is that it?

Yes, because the area of the

8

trunk is an area which was removed from the area which

9

is considered incident to an arrest.

Now, of course, I

10

am not here to reargue Belton, because we -- the facts

11

in Belton and the facts in this case are different, but

12

I do say that there is a distinction between the

13

interior of the vehicle and the trunk of the vehicle as

14

far as police officers being permitted to invade that

15

area once an arrest has taken place, and there is no

16

danger that evidence is going to be destroyed, or that

17

the arrested person can grab a weapon.

18

QUESTION;

But as the Chief Justice has

19

pointed out in some of his questions, with today's motor

vehicle design, there isn’t much of a difference in many

21

instances, is there?

Robbins, because —

QUESTION:

MR. GARBER*

Well, is you answer to me yes?

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GARBER:

The answer is yes.
We would have to overrule Robbins?
I would think the Court would

12

have to, for this reason, that in the Robbins case, as

13

in this case, there was an arrest after the police

14

officers had probable cause to believe that contraband

15

was contained in the car.

16

cause didn't arise until after the officer smelled the

17

odor of marijuana emanating from the passenger

18

compartment, and it was at that point that a search of

19

the car was conducted.

20

In Robbins, that probable

Now, in this particular case, the only

21

difference between Robbins and Ross is that the police

22

acted on the basis of an informant's tip, but Robbins

23

started out as an automobile search, and Ross was an

24

automobile search, but the point of departure came where

25

the police in Robbins seized the plastic bag, and the
34

police in Ross seized a paper bag.
I don't think we have to get into a worthy or

2
3

an unworthy container rule, because if we apply the

4

exigent circumstance doctrine in all of these cases,

5

then all we have to determine is at what point the

6

exigencies ceased, and at the point where the exigencies

7

ceased, then the warrant requirement comes into play.
QUESTIONS

8

10

Well, do you regard the so-called

automobile exception, whatever it may consist of, as
simply a branch of exigent circumstances?
MR. GARBERs

11

The automobile exception has been

12

held by this Court to be an exception, to be an

13

exception, starting with Carroll.

14

Carroll, in Carroll there was no — there was no cause

15

to arrest the occupants in that case, because the

16

offense, transporting liquor, was a misdemeanor, and it

17

had to have been committed within the presence of the

18

officers.

But if we look at

So, the exigencies were in searching the

19

20

vehicle to see whether or not contraband was in the

QUESTION»

Well, that isn’t the rule that we

follow, is it?
SR. GARBER»

Not since Chambers, and I think

4

one of the problems in this whole area is Chambers,

5

when Chambers permits a search of a vehicle to take

6

place at a location other than where the initial arrest

7

occurred, and perhaps it is Chambers, as we have

8

indicated, that really needs to be reconsidered.

Well, maybe it is Robbins.

Well, of course, I am aware of

Your Honors* position in these matters.

QUESTION:

The Court can

The Court —

What you mean is, you are aware of

the majority’s position, isn’t it?

15

MR. GARBER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well —

I would have thought, Mr. Garber,

17

that your position would be that as soon as there was

18

any effort to open the trunk, as distinguished from the

19

interior of the car, whatever the interior of the car

20

really is, that that is when the Fourth Amendment

21

violation began.

22
23

MR. GARBER:

But the intrusion went beyond

that. Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

Well —

25

MR. GARBER:

The intrusion went into the

container itself
QUESTION;

2

That might well be so, but the

3

question is, when was the first instant when the Fourth

4

Amendment was violated, in your view?
MR. GARBER;

5

When the police opened the bag,

6

because in Robbins, for example, the police opened the

7

tailgate, and also lifted up the luggage —
QUESTION;

8

9

And you equate that to opening the

trunk?
MR. GARBER;

10

Oh, yes.

I would think --

11

because we are talking about automobile design.

12

think these cases should turn on the design of a

13

vehicle.

14

the case turn on the configuration or the worthiness of

15

the particular container.

16

I don’t think that is the issue.

QUESTION;

I don't

Nor should

Well, you say the design is

17

irrelevant.

18

what are the limits on the interior as the Court applied

19

it in the Belton case?

20

You suggest that.

MR. GARBER;

But then how do you —

The limits of the interior would

21

be that area which had been occupied by either the

22

driver or the passenger, because it was in that area

23

that weapons could be concealed and evidence could be

24

hidden, so we are talking about the passenger

25

compartment of the vehicle as opposed to the trunk or
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 <2021 554-2345

1

storage area, and again, we get into automobile design.

2

I don't think design is relevant.

3

about area within the arrestee's control, and in Belton,

4

of course, the decision was that the — actually the

5

passenger area of the car was the area that could be

6

permissibly — permissibly searched.

7

We are talking now

But the problem with the automobile exception

8

as it has now evolved is the — well, it started out

9

with an inherent mobility factor, and that — then it

10

evolved into a diminished expectation of privacy, and

11

then state and governmental regulation.

12

the inherently — inherent mobility factor is really the

13

only true and genuine factor that should play a part in

14

these cases, because, let's face it, an automobile is a

15

very expensive piece of personal property.

16

house, it is the most expensive investment an individual

17

can make, and to say that merely because you own a car,

18

that once you get in that car your expectation of

19

privacy diminishes, I don't think that that is

20

compatible with the real world as we know it.

21

22
23

We submit that

Next to a

The automobile today is much different than
the automobile of 30, 40, 50 years ago.
QUESTIONj

Well, certainly your expectation of

24

privacy when you are driving down a public street with

25

no shades on the windows of present-day cars is not as
38

1

great in a car as when you are sitting in your house.

2

MR. GARBER;

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. GARBER;

That may be true.
People can look in the windows.
That's true, but there are areas

5

of that vehicle where that expectation of privacy can be

6

manifested, and it is those areas that we are talking

7

about.

8

briefcase or a paper bag or some other container in the

9

trunk of a vehicle, as opposed to the interior, I think

10
11

In other words, if an individual places, say, a

that manifests an expectation of privacy.
QUESTION;

Well, it is true also"that if a

12

person places an envelop in his inside pocket of his

13

coat as he walks down the street, that manifests an

14

expectation of privacy, and yet a search incident to

15

arrest, you can search the entire person.

16
17
18
19
20

MR. GARBER;

Yes, but this isn’t a search

incident to an arrest case.
QUESTION;

Well, but certainly the same

general factors should govern.
MR. GARBER;

Well, I don’t think so, because

21

search incident to arrest is entirely different from the

22

automobile search that we are talking about here.

23

you have a search incident to an arrest, you are

24

attempting either to seize evidence immediately

25

associated with the person or means by which the

When

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

individual can escape, and therefore this Court and

2

other courts have permitted a search not only of the

3

person, a full-blown search of the person, but also of

4

the immediate area.

5

But in this particular case, in the Ross case,

6

as in the Robbins case, this wasn't a search incident to

7

an arrest, because the arrest had been effected, and

8

when — once again I stress this inherent mobility

9

factor.

If — if this factor is applied in these types

10

of cases, we don't have to worry about paper bags and

11

cardboard boxes and shaving kits.

12

at whether or not the exigencies permitted the scope of

13

the intrusion at the particular time, and if that is

14

removed, then any search conducted without a warrant is

15

-- is unreasonable.

We only have to look

Now, I still don't understand the government's

16
17

argument as to the costs involved in obtaining a

18

warrant.

19

essentially a one or two-page affidavit, an affidavit

20

that could have been prepared within the time period

21

that the processing in this case occurred, an affidavit

22

that could have been taken to the magistrate either that

23

evening or the following day, or even telephoned in.

24
25

We are talking about, in this type of case,

QUESTION!

Is the magistrate housed in the

HR. GARBER:

1

The magistrates, of course, their

2

offices were in the — in the courthouse, but they do --

3

they are available at home, and I do know that, from

4

talking to the magistrates, that one of the procedures

5

is the ability to record the oral affidavit as it is

6

given over the phone, and then to reduce that to writing

7

later.

8

in the morning, the magistrate on duty could take the

9

oral affidavit, and could give the authorization to

So, even assuming it is midnight or 2:00 o’clock

10

conduct the search under the amendment to the rule, and

11

it is that technology which I think undercuts the

12

government's argument.

13

QUESTION:

Do you think there is no difference

14

between the practical problems, if you are talking about

15

Washington, D. C., or out in the prairies and the

16

mountains in the west and other parts of the country —

17

MR. GARBER:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Oh, I think -— where you might be

100 or 200

miles from the nearest magistrate?
MR. GARBER:

Oh, I think there is a

21

difference, because assuming you have a single law

22

enforcement officer who is covering 90 square miles of

23

territory in a vehicle, and he encounters a situation

24

such as Robbins, for example, and it is going to take

25

maybe — maybe 45 minutes or an hour before he gets
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

backup, the exigencies of that situation may permit a

2

result which is different from this case.

3

That is why the exigent circumstances factor

4

has a plasticity and a flexibility which allows it to be

5

applied nationwide.

6

enforcement are much different in sparsely populated

7

areas than they are in large metropolitan areas.

8

this case, we had three police officers on the scene.

9

They were there within ten minutes of the call.

So, of course, problems of law

In

They

10

took the vehicle back to the police headquarters within

11

— within minutes.

12

And to further undercut the government's

13

argument, the following day, as the record of this case

14

will show, when the complaint was filed with the

15

magistrate, that complaint contained a statement of

16

facts, a probable cause statement of facts which was

17

really tantamount to a warrant affidavit, so there was

18

no reason in this case why a warrant could not have been

19

obtained, any more than there was a reason in Robbins

20

for not obtaining a warrant.

21

We submit that Robbins is good law, that the

22

— that the plurality of opinion in the case is good

23

because it -- it upholds the — the philosophical and

24

the considerations of the Fourth Amendment.

25

the - the judicial branch of the government before the

executive, and of course the more you whittle away on

2

the warrant requirements, the more danger you have of —

3

of one branch actually encroaching on the powers of the

4

other.

5

So, we submit that the warrant requirement has

6

a real function, and that this business about the

7

warrant in the case of a dwelling sets the perimeter of

8

the search, that’s not the — that’s not the point.

9

point is that it places a natural and detached

The

10

magistrate between the citizen and the police officer.

11

And look at the savings.

12

in support of a search warrant in this case, we probably

13

wouldn’t be here, because the reviewing court could look

14

at the face of the affidavit and determine whether or

15

not the affidavit established probable cause.

16

If there had been an affidavit

I could recite that affidavit to this Court

17

within five minutes, as to what was needed.

The

18

affidavit in the first paragraph could have obtained the

19

informant information which would have satisfied the

21

officer which corroborated the fact that the car was

22

there and the defendant matched the description given by

observed two containers in the trunk compartment of the

2

car, and they had probable cause to believe that they

3

contained narcotics.
These containers could have been seized.

4

The

5

magistrate or the judge could have given his

6

authorization, and they could have been opened, and

7

instead of having a evidentiary hearing in which a

8

police officer, counsel, and the court were involved,

9

say, in hours of testimony — in this case there were

10

109 pages of transcript on this motion to suppress.

11

there had been a warrant, the judge would have been able

12

to pass upon the legality of the search by looking at

13

the affidavit, unless you can show that the affidavit

14

could be attacked, as in Franks versus Delaware, but you

15

would have to prove at that point that the police

officer deliberately lied.

So your nationwide — your

MR. GARBER*

No, it says don’t look in those

articles or containers which have been immobilized,

which are in the custody of the police, where there is

18

no danger of these articles being lost or destroyed, and

there is ample opportunity to secure judicial approval.

police officer, and he can ascertain by the weight and

the feel of the bag that there is a weapon in there —

QUESTION:

Or a monkey wrench?

18

MR. GARBER:

If he is in doubt, then I think

19

he needs a warrant.

As I say, all of these — we are

20

dealing here with relative factors, where the facts in

21

each case is different, but arguing the facts of this

22

particular case, I don’t see any distinction between

23

this case and Robinson at all, and in Robbins, where the

tailgate was opened and the luggage compartment was

25

opened, all of that was sanctioned by the Court.

It was

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. FREY:

10

Thank you.
Mr. Frey.

Justice Stevens asked my colleague

11

about lifting up a blanket that might be covering some

12

items in the back of the car, and I think this touches

13

upon the point which, as far as I am aware, is the only

14

substantive argument of policy advanced for requiring

15

warrants for searching insubstantial containers, and

16

that is the bright line test, argument.
Now, we submit that the bright line argument

17
18

that if you require a warrant for all containers

19

officers will know what they have to do is faulty for a

20

number of reasons.

21

is only to prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures

22

under the Fourth Amendment, and there is a limit to the

23

extent to which you can characterize reasonable searches

24

as unreasonable for purposes of applying a bright line

25

test.

The first reason is that your power

But in any event, it is illusory to suppose

1

2

that you will have a bright line test by the all

3

container rule suggested in the Robbins plurality, and

4

in the opinion of the court of appeals below, since

5

there is enormous room for confusion, as your question

6

pointed out, over what constitutes a container.

7

QUESTION:

So you want us to overrule Robbins?

8

HR. FREY:

Well, that is certainly one of the

9

things that we would like you to do, and I believe that

10

is open, and I do disagree, the government does disagree

11

with the views expressed in the plurality opinion in

12

Robbins.

13

framework, although not with his actual application of

14

his analysis to the facts of Robbins.

We do agree with Justice Powell's analytical

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Frey, may I ask this question

16

about your bright line point insofar as it is relevant

17

to a choice between the two submissions that the

18

government makes?

19

containers, private and non-private, and your second

20

submission is that once you can get into the car, you

21

can search everything within the car that might contain

22

the contraband for which you are searching.

23

the two submissions would be better from a law

24

enforcement standpoint in terms of simplicity of the

25

rule?

One is that there are two kinds of

MR. FREY t

1

That -- that was the point that I

2

was coming to.

Our position is, of course, that if you

3

do need a bright line, then in the context of an

4

automobile it is unquestionable that the bright line is

5

— is supplied by the rule that you may search

6

containers within an automobile instead of trying to

7

decide whether something is a container or is not.

8

we pointed out in our brief, there is a First Circuit

9

case that held a rolled up raincoat from which a

As

with stolen goods, shopping bags open at the top but not

13

revealing to plain view all of their contents.

14

are going to do is shift the area of uncertainty.

15

are not going to relieve any uncertainty, and in fact,

16

the post-Chadwick experience in dealing with the

17

expectation of privacy analysis has shown very little

18

confusion on the part of the courts between discerning

19

what kinds of containers have high privacy attributes

20

and require the additional prophylaxis of a warrant

21

requirement to protect privacy interests and what kinds

22

of containers don't.

Pockets of clothing, pillow cases stuffed

Now, I wanted to make a point briefly about

24

telephonic warrants, because that was raised.

25

Telephonic warrants are to be used only in extraordinary

1

circumstances.

The policy of the Department of Justice

2

and I think the policy under the rule is that it is only

3

to be used in cases where there is something on the

4

verge of exigent circumstances.

5

designed, in fact, for the Wyoming kind of case, where

6

the magistrate may be several hundred miles away.

7

are still required to write out in full your warrant

8

application, and then read it over the phone for the

9

magistrate.

It is normally

The time savings from a telephonic warrant

10

which, as I say, would never be used in a case lik.e

11

this, are in fact very slight.

12

You

Mow, I think that my colleague has been put in

13

a position of essentially arguing for overruling the

14

automobile search exception, because I think he

15

implicitly acknowledges that it makes no sense to say

16

that automobiles can be searched as a matter of

17

expectation of privacy analysis without a warrant, but

18

containers cannot be searched, and I think it is quite

19

clear from the recent decisions of this Court, and

20

Chadwick says so explicitly, that the automobile search

21

exception is not based on exigency that occurs at the

22

time the item is searched.

23

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that there is no

24

greater invasion of legitimate privacy to go into the

25

trunk and open everything in the trunk than to go into
56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the interior of the car, however that is defined, and

2

open everything in the interior of the car?

3

difference in privacy -HR. FREY:

4

No

No, I think there may be some

5

difference, but I think it is clearly settled that

6

whatever that difference is, it is not dispositive of

7

the right of the officers to make a warrantless probable

8

cause search of the trunk.

9

I think a glove compartment is probably a relatively

I think there is — I mean,

10

private area compared to many kinds of containers that

11

may be searched which may be governed by the decision in

12

this case.
QUESTION;

13

May I ask you another question, Mr.

14

Frey?

You don't contend there is no privacy interest in

15

a paper bag, do you?

16

MR. FREY;

That's correct.

17

QUESTION:

In other words, say you had an

18

airport case, and you had enough of a suspicion to stop

19

a person and ask him a question or two.

20

follow that you could say, open up your paper bag and

21

let me look in it, would it?

It wouldn't

22

MR. FREY:

It would not follow, no.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, because there is some privacy

24
25

even in the paper bag.
MR. FREY;

We are not saying that the police
57

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

could go to some location where there happened to be a

2

number of paper bags in the luggage room and start just

3

looking through them.

4

is that the substantive requirement of focused

5

reasonable suspicion in these cases amounting to

6

probable cause to believe that there is evidence of a

7

crime is the critical protection of the privacy

8

interests that the Fourth Amendment supplies, and in

9

this context it is an ample protection, and the

That is not the point.

The point

10

protection of the warrant clause is very, very slight in

11

this context.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, if — you say then that

13

the — that you should get a different result where the

14

container is in a car than if you find it somewhere

15

else, say in a — say you know a person has checked a

16

container in a checkroom, and you have probable cause to

17

believe it contains contraband.

18

MS. FREY:

No, our — our principal submission

19

is that the result should be the same, that probable

20

cause suffices to justify searching —

MR. FREY:

Well, I wouldn’t say just the lower

expectation of privacy.

9

suitcase, and you have probable cause to search them

10

12

QUESTION:

Maybe we posed the wrong question.

13

MR. FREY:

Well, we would — I would be

14

prepared to argue if the Court wanted to reconsider

15

Chadwick and Sanders, but I don’t think — I want to

16

stress that Chadwick and Sanders focused on the question

17

of whether suitcases and luggage are the kinds of items

18

that require the protection of the warrant procedure,

19

and it looked in that to the customary uses of the

20

items, their structural integrity, and the value that

21

society attached to them, and it made a conclusion which

22

I think is the Court’s job to make, yea or nay, that

23

these have sufficient privacy attributes that a warrant

24

requirement was appropriate.

25

QUESTION:

Just suppose for a moment — do you

draw a line between a locked trunk and an open trunk,

and an unlocked trunk?

MR. FREY;

I do for purposes of search

In this case you would?

6

MR. FREY;

No, in this case we are not

suggesting that a warrantless search of either would be

appropriate.

But I thought you said you could

10

search the bag but you couldn't search the locked
