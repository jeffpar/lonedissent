ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

MR. LEE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10 Court:
11

At issue in this case is the constitutionality of

12 the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, one of five
13 statutes enacted in

1978 as part of a comprehensive effort

14 to deal with this nation's energy problems.

It would be

15 helpful to consider the statute in two basic parts.

The

16 first part consists of Titles I and III, which share three
17 common statutorially-identified goals.
18

The first is to promote the conservation of energy

19 supplied by utilities; second is to optimize the efficient
20 use of facilities and resources by utilities; and the third
21 is to ensure equitable rights to consumers.

Title I deals

22 with electricity, and Title III with gas.
23

Title I requires state regulatory authorities and

24 non-regulated electric utilities to consider the adoption of
25 one set of standards, six in number, dealing with electric

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 rates, and a second set of standards, five in number,
2 dealing with terms and conditions of electric service.

The

3 rate standards, all of them, and some of the electric
4 service standards are directed toward two objectives.
5

The first is to cut down the amount of electric

6 energy, and therefore imported oil, that is consumed in this
7 country.

And the second objective is to shift electric

8 demand away from peak, periods, thereby diminishing the use
9 of less efficient generating facilities and scarce fuels;
10 notably, oil.
11

As to gas, Title III requires consideration of only

12 two of the terms service standards.

Each of the standards,

13 both Title I and Title III, is to be considered in a hearing
14 after public notice, and a written statement of the reasons
15 for declining to implement or adopt — in the event of a
16 declamation to implement or adopt — any of the standards is
17 to be made available to the public.
18

In addition, Titles I and III require that within

19 one year after enactment of the statute and annually
20 thereafter for ten years, state regulatory authorities and
21 non-regulated utilities report the progress of their
22 consideration of these standards to the Secretary of Energy
23 who in turn is to submit a summary and analysis of the
24 reports to Congress.
25

The other part of the statute is Title II, probably

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202)-554-2345

1

the most controversial.

Specifically, Section 210, whose

2 objective is to encourage the development of cogeneration
3 and small power production facilities.

Cogeneration is the

4 combined product of both electrical energy and useful
5 thermal energy such as heat or steam from a single process.
6 It has great potential as a source of energy conservation.

7 At one time it accounted for some 15% of this nation's
8 energy total, but with the advent of cheap fossile fuel
9 power, that has diminished to 4%.
10

A small power production facility is a facility

11

having a capacity of no more than 80 megawatts and using

12

something other fossile fuels, defined by the statute as

13 biomass, waste, geothermal or renewable resources such as
14 wind, water, solar energy, for the purpose of producing
15 electric power.
16

Congress identified two impediments to the

17 potential of cogeneration and small power production
18 facilities as additional sources of domestic power with

19 consequent lessening of dependence on foreign oil.

The

20 first was its conclusion that subjecting cogeneration and
21

small power production facilities to the usual state and

22 federal regulatory burdens was unnecessary and would unduly
23 discourage their development.
24

The more controversial aspect of the congressional

25 determination was the second.

These two types of facilities

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) -554-2345

1 must rely on traditional electric utilities, both as a
2 source of backup power, and also as a market for their
3 surplus power.

They do not sell generally to the public.

4 They use them only for their own purposes.
5

Evidence before Congress showed that since these

6 facilities are potential competitors of public utilities,
7 utilities were often less than cooperative in supplying
8 either backup power or markets.
9

PURPA deals with each of these impediments.

Its

10 response to the problem of surplus and backup power is the
11 most hotly-contested of the Act’s provisions.

What Congress

12 eventually adopted in this respect represents a compromise.
13 The administration’s proposal, which passed the House and
14 was sent to the Senate, would have established a regulatory
15 program virtually identical to that upheld by this Court in
16 the Virginia Surface Mining Act case last term, under which
17 the regulatory burden would have been assumed by federal
18 authorities in tha event that state authorities chose not to
19 participate.
20

At the other end of the spectrum, the Senate bill

21 would have required the Secretary to follow basically the
22 Title I/Title III approach, which is simply to recommend
23 guidelines to state public service commissions that they
24 could adopt or not.
25

Opponents of the administration House bill, by the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202)-554-2345

1 time it got to the Senate, presented to Congress substantial
2 testimony and arguments to the effect that it was state
3 rather than federal officials who possess the necessary
4 expertise to implement reforms.

The legislation dealing

5 with these issues should be responsive to local needs and
6 local differences, and that what might be appropriate for
7 Florida might not necessarily be appropriate for Oregon.
8 And that the states should be allowed to continue to
9 experiment in the national interest with different
10 regulatory approaches.
11

The compromise that became law was responsive to

12 these arguments, which were grounded in the preservation of
13 state interests.

The Act, in fact, gives the authority to

4

14 make general rules to the Federal Energy Regulatory
15 Commission in order to achieve the general objectives of the
16 Act, but with the more specific authority to implement the
17 statute being left to the states.
18

The Commission has, in fact, adopted regulations

19 which afford the states great latitude in determining how
20 the congressional objectives are to be achieved.

Under

21 these regulations, state implementation may be accomplished
22 by any one of three ways.
23 regulations.

First of all, by the issuance of

Second, and probably most important for

24 purposes of this lawsuit, by the resolution of disputes
25 between utilities and qualifying facilities on a

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202)-554-2345

1 case-by-case basis.

find the third is a general catch-all;

2 by any other action reasonably designed to give effect to
3 the Commission’s rules.
4

This suit was brought by the state of Mississippi

5 and its public service commission with Mississippi Power and
6 Light being permitted to intervene, against the Secretary of
7 Energy who has general responsibility for Titles I and III,
8 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which has
9 general responsibility for Title II, Section 210, seeking a
10 declaratory judgment that the entire Act is beyond the scope
11 of Congress’ Commerce Clause power and an unconstitutional
12 invasion of state sovereignty as declared by this Court in
13 National League of Cities and Towns v. Usery.
14

Judge Cox’s decision holding the statute

15 unconstitutional on both grounds preceded this Court's
16 decision in Hodel v. Indiana and Virginia Surface Mining,
17 and this appeal followed.
18

There are two independent reasons in the

19 government’s view why the decision of the lower court must
20 be reversed.
21

First, —

QUESTION;

May I ask, Mr. Lee, you did say that

22 whatever federal regulations are needed have now been
23 promulgated?
24

MR. LEE;

That is correct.

That is correct.

25

And they are extremely deferential to the states.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

2 proponents of that approach before Congress said they should
3 —

6

QUESTIONt
'

MR. LEE*

How long have they been effective?
They were adopted — I’ll find that out.

The two reasons why this decision must be reversed,

7 in our view, are, first, applying the standards announced by
8 this Court in Hodel and earlier in Usery, there is no
9 constitutional violation, looking at it as an exercise of
10 Congress’ Commerce Clause power.

And second, the Act is

11 also a legitimate exercise of Congress’ power to provide for
12 our national defense.
13

I will look at the Commerce Clause issues first.

14 Last term in the Virginia Surface Mining case, this Court
15 identified three hurdles plus a balancing test that a
16 challenge to a congressional exercise of the Commerce power
17 on Tenth Amendment grounds must surmount.

Before turning to

18 a specific discussion of those three issues, however, I
19 would like first to point out the aspect of this case that
20 distinguishes it from National League of Cities and Towns v.
21 Usery, and simply makes the rationale of that case
22 inapplicable to this case.
23

The evil against which this Court's holding in

24 National League of Cities and Towns protects is intrusion by
25 one sovereign in a federal system into the prerogatives of

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 another.

And that problem simply does not exist where, as

2 here, the only reason that the states are exercising
3 authority in the field at all is that Congress chooses to
4 permit them to do so.

This difference between the Act in

5 both of the predecessors to this case and this case is
6 illustrated both by the history and also by the content of
7 this legislation.
8

The appellees concede, as they must, that the state

9 functions of whose federal invasion they complain could have
10 been totally preempted by Congress.

The reason that

11 Congress did not do so is that it was persuaded by the
12 advocates of Federalism that the wiser policy and the more
13 effective policy was to preserve a larger role for the
14 states.
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Lee, do you think Congress could

16 direct, for instance, a state legislature to consider
17 certain statutes?

Mandate that under the Tenth Amendment?

18

I believe, Justice O'Connor, that if it

MR. LEE;

19 was in an area, that if it was in an area, that clearly
20 could be preempted by Congress, in which Congress itself
21 could have acted, and then Congress —
22

QUESTION*

So in the Commerce area you would argue

23 that Congress could go so far as to even mandate state
24 legislatures to consider certain laws.
25

MR. LEE;

Of course, the word "mandate" triggers

10

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202)-554-2345

S

sensitive nerves in the Tenth Amendment area.

But mandate a

2 consideration, particularly in a circumstance such as you
3 have in Titles I and III where the only obligation is simply
4 to consider but not to adopt one way or the other -5

QUESTION;

But these public utility commissions of

6 states are an administrative arm of the Legislative Branch
7 of the government» and they are being told that they must
8 consider certain action.

They are not being told they have

9 to implement it, but they must consider it, isn’t that so?
10

MR. LEE;

That is absolutely correct, and for

11 reasons that I attempt to discuss, we believe that that is
12 constitutional.
13
7

The principal reason is, aside from the three

14 hurdles, when you consider the balance of relevant
15 interests, state and federal, particularly as applied to
16 this kind of case, it is not that much of an intrusion,
17 certainly not an unconstitutional intrusion, when you’re
18 dealing in areas like the Commerce Clause -- and I reiterate
19 that there is no dispute in this case that the turf on which
20 we are operating is federal turf — it is congressional
21 turf, the kind of regulatory area in which Congress could
22 legislate if it chose to do so.
23

Instead, what Congress concluded was that its

24 federal purposes would be better served if it permitted the
25 states to consider certain basic objectives, not to adopt

them but simply to consider them.
QUESTION:

General Lee, what is the mechanism by

which the FEBC is entitled to enforce this duty to consider?
MR. LEE:

The duty to consider the Title I and III

standards is vested in the Secretary.

And the mechanism is

6 as follows.
7

There is the authority in the Secretary as to both

8 Title I and Title III to intervene before the state
9

regulatory proceedings.

In the event that the matter then

10

proceeds to court, as to Title I the Secretary has the

11

authority to participate as a party as an intervenor.

12

Title III, with respect to gas, he has the authority to

13

participate only as an amicus.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LEE:

What court does it proceed to?
The state courts.

And whatever courts

16

properly review the proceedings — whatever courts the

17

states have designated as those that are proper to —

18
19

QUESTION:
consider it.

As to

Well, the law says that the body must

How does it — if the agency just — nothing

20 ever comes before the agency, they don’t put it on the
21

docket, no one — does somebody suggest to them that they

22 are under a legal obligation?
23
24
25

MR. LEE:

I suppose the Secretary could appear and

suggest they are under a legal obligation.
QUESTION:

Could appear before them and say I move

1

you or perhaps you should — and then they reject him and

2 then —
3

MR. LEE;

4

QUESTION;

And then they reject him.
And then he can take them to state court

5 to review an administrative agency —

MR. LEE;

6

As I read the statute, what it is talking

7 about is that in the event that it is taken to state court,
8 he does have the right to take —

QUESTION;

9

Oh, if it is taken to state court.

10

Well, how does it ever get there?

11

want to go to court.

12

MR. LEE;

Right.

The agency says we don't

The way the Act handles that,

13 Justice White, is that in the event that the regulatory
14 agency does not consider it, then in the next rate
15 proceeding,

which is basically an adjudicatory proceeding to

16 -- well, whether adjudicatory or legislative — in the next
17 rate proceeding, it must consider it at that time.
18

Now, there is, of course, --

19

QUESTION;

What if it decides it isn't going to do

20 it?
21

MR. LEE;

There is always that possibility that it

22 can simply decide not to.

We assume, in light of the fact

23 that states recognize the rule of law and that this is an
24 area of federal authority, that they will conform in one way
25 or another.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

Is there some authority or even if there

2 isn't, could the Secretary bring a suit and get an
3 injunction ordering them to consider it, or not?
4

MR. LEE:

5

QUESTION:

Apparently not.

There is a —

There is no provision for it, anyway, in

6 the Act.
7

MR. LEE:

No.

Apparently, the only authority that

8 the Secretary has to enforce through federal court is his
9 right to intervene in state court.
10

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor, is there anymore

11 effectiveness to this than there is to the Constitution’s
12 provision that the state officers must take an oath and
13 support the Constitution of the United States?

Is it

14 anymore effective than that?
15

MR. LEE:

My opponent, I am sure,

would say that it

16 does impose more extensive obligations than that.

The

17 obligations that are imposed on the state that are to be
18 balanced against the very substantial interest that the
19 federal government has in regulating its energy program with
20 concomitant consequences not only on energy savings
21 themselves but on no such lesser interests as inflation,
22 interstate commerce and national security are as follows.
23

On the one hand, the state must consider it; it

24 must hold hearings, must give public notice.

Second, it

25 must give written determination or written statements

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202)-554-2345

1

concerning its reasons.

In the event that it decides not to

2 adopt one of the Title I or Title III standards», then it

3 must give written statement of the reasons to do so.

And

4 finally,- the fourth is that it has to report on an annual
5 basis for ten years.

And that's it under Title I and Title

6 III.

7

Now, with regard to Section 210 — this, as I say,

8 is where we go beyond considering and actually having to do
9 something — it would be anomalous in the extreme, I submit,
10 to

hold the Surface Mining Act, held constitutional last

11

term, constitutional, and at the same time hold an act

12

unconstitutional which was enacted as a compromise in direct

13 response, in direct reaction, to Federalism interests asking
14 for lesser intrusion in the state prerogatives and hold it
15 unconstitutional in the name of the Tenth Amendment, which
16 of course preserves state prerogatives.
17

QUESTION;

Because, —

Mr. Lee, in the Surface Mining case,

18 couldn't the states continue regulating in that field as
19 long as they didn't conflict with federal law?

I mean,

20 there is a section preserving state law and procedure if it
21

doesn't conflict.

And in this case, the state can't choose

22 not to participate unless it just wants to get out public

23 utility regulation totally.
24

So the choice for the states is much harder here,

25 is it not, than it was in the Surface Mining case?

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1

MR. LEEj

Two answers to that, Justice O'Connor

2 The first is I don’t think it was harder because while both
3 of them are complex pieces of legislation, the basic
4 approach as to the Surface Mining Act was that state plans
5 were submitted to the Secretary, and if they were
6 acceptable, then the states could regulate.

Otherwise, the

7 state took over and regulated directly.
8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LEE:

You mean the federal government.
Excuse me, the federal government took

10 over and regulated directly.
11

But the more persuasive distinction is that

12 whatever the distinction, whatever the comparative intrusion
13 on state interests, I think the best judge of that has to be
14 the states themselves.

And it was organizations such as the

15 National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and
16 others that presented extensive testimony before the Senate
17 saying do not adopt the Virginia Surface Mining model
18 because if you do, three things will happen.
19

One is it will be a greater than necessary

20 intrusion in the state prerogatives; number two, we need the
21 flexibility in this area of electric generation regulation
22 to make adaptation for the differences that exist from one
23 locality to the other; and the final one is we need the
24 opportunity to continue to experiment.
25

It was in — I think there is no doubt that if the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

1 House bill had passed it would be constitutional.

My

2 opponents concede that it was a Virginia Surface Mining type
3 statute.

The reason that the House bill did not pass was

4 because the advocates of Federalism came in and said, this
5 is too much of an intrusion under our prerogatives.
6

The other matter that needs to be mentioned in this

7 respect —
8

QUESTION;

I'm just curious, Mr. Solicitor, do we

9 know what the recorded vote of the Mississippi senators and
10 the House delegation were on this compromise?
11

MR. LEE;

That's one thing I haven't checked into,

12 Justice Brennan.
13

(Laughter. )

14

But it is significant in that respect that the

15 group that is perhaps the most intensely affected, the
16 regulatory commissioners themselves, were at the forefront
17 of this plea, don't adopt the Virginia Surface Mining model,
18 and they were also the ones who praised before the Federal
19 Energy Regulatory Commission the approach that was followed.
20

QUESTION;

Hell, maybe they just talked

Congress

21 into passing a law that gave them an unconstitutional order.
22

MR. LEE;

Oh, so that they could win in this

23 lawsuit.
24

(Laughter. )

25

At least if

they did, they did

a verysophisticated

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

1 job of it in presenting their evidence before the Congress.
2

I'd like to deal now with the compliance by the

3 states with the Section 210 requirements for the sale of
4 surplus power and the purchase of backup power.
5

There are three opportunities; there are three ways

6 that the states are given to comply, and the third one, of
7 course, is the very broad one, "any other means" by which
8 the policies of the federal regulation may be obtained.
9

But one of those options is simply to entertain

10 disputes between regulated utilities on the one hand and
11 qualifying facilities, cogeneration or small power
12 production facilities, on the other on a case-by-case
13 basis.

Thus viewed, all that Section 210, as certainly as

14 implemented by the FERC regulations, does is simply to
15 provide a federal rule of decision that is applicable in
16 those cases where the state entertains lawsuits for other
17 type of adjudicatory proceedings.
18

Thus viewed, regardless of what the constitutional

19 rule might be in the event that regulations had been
20 required, — in further answer to Justice O'Connor's
21 question — or that legislation had been required, that
22 obligation can be performed, can be satisfied, simply by
23 entertaining disputes.

And that brings the case squarely

24 within this Court's holding in Testa v. Katt, that it is not
25 unconstitutional for the federal government, for Congress,

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

1 to supply the rule of decision applicable in state
2 adjudicatory proceedings so long as that same kind of rule,
3 if enacted as a source of state law, would be constitutional.
4

I'd like to say just a word about the comparative

5 weight of the federal and the state interests in this case.
6 This case demonstrates better than either of predecessor the
7 wisdom of what this Court implied in National League of
8 Cities and Towns, and expressly stated in the Virginia
9 Surface Mining case, that the federal interest — that
10 regardless of the three tests, that the federal interest
11 nevertheless may be such that it justifies state submission.
12

On the federal side of the balance scale, it would

13 be impossible to overstate the magnitude of this nation's
14 energy problem.

It's important not only in its own right,

15 but also because of its effect on inflation, the
16 environment, interstate trade and national security.
17

Our opponents have said that it’s in the future,

18 and that it's not something that Congress has to deal with
19 yet.

I submit that Congress is to be praised, rather than

20 its statute to be held unconstitutional simply because it
21 anticipated and dealt with the problem before we have, once
22 again, such severe problems as we have had in the past.
23

The other side of the balance scale is the adverse

24 effect on state interests.

I submit that for reasons

25 discussed, these are minimal as to Titles I and III; they

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

1 require only consideration.

And as to Section 210, since

2 they can be satisfied by a means that has already been
3 validated by this Court in Testa v. Katt, the comparative
4- balance between state and federal interests clearly favors
5 the constitutionality.
6

And finally, this statute is a proper exercise of

7 Congress’ national security powers.

The linkage between

8 national security on the one hand, and on the other, the
9 dependence on foreign oil in this case and controlling the
10 price of timber sales involved in Case v. Bowles greatly
11 favors the balance in this particular case.

The courts of

12 appeals that have dealt with this issue have uniformly
13 upheld congressional statutes enacted in the interest of
14 national security when attacked on Tenth Amendment grounds.
15

I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEX A. ALSTON, JR., ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

19

MR. ALSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20 the Court:
21

I think probably the best place to start with the

22 question of constitutionality of PURPA would be look at the
23 Act itself.

The Solicitor General went through the Act with

24 some detail, and the mechanics of the Act that he did
25 discuss I do not disagree with.

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

1

However, this is certainly more than just simply a

2 suggestion to the state of Mississippi on how to regulate
3 their public service commission.

It's certainly more than

4 just a study telling the public service commission what to
5 do.
6

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the federal authority

7 could have done all the things that they hoped the states
8 would do?
9

MR. ALSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, if, as a matter of

10 fact, in the findings they found that this did have a
11 substantial effect on interstate commerce, and if indeed
12 they found that the Act itself was reasonable to affect the
13 utilities themselves, then perhaps they could do that.
14 may be absolutely so.
15 question.
16

It

I don't know the answer to that

They may could have preempted the area.
But in the field of Federalism, if we talk, about

17 Federalism, that does not destroy the principles of
18 Federalism.

I disagree with the Solicitor General.

If the

19 federal government takes over an area, if they have a
20 constitutional right to take over that area in the
21 Constitution, if it's permissible under the Commerce Clause,
22 the federal government at that point carries the burden;
23 they are the responsible party to exercise that law.
24

One of the great principles of Federalism, as a

25 citizen of the state of Mississippi, I can look to my public

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 officials.

We elect our public service commissioners.

I

2 can look, to them to implement, to promulgate state law.
3 do not want for them to implement federal law.

I

I have no

4 control over that.
5

It's deceptively simple to say, when they are

6 looking at a statute like this, to say well, this is good.
7 A transient majority of Congress may say look, this is very
8 good for the state of Mississippi, and what we'll do is
9 we're going to tell the state of Mississippi what they are
10 going to do.

That makes it easy.

But it completely

11 destroys the concept of Federalism.
4

12

I*m not looking now to my public service

13 commissioners to implement state law.

The public service

14 commission is the one that gets called when the rates go
15 up.

The burdens should not be placed on them unless they

16 have consented to, by the electorate in the state of
17 Mississippi.
18

QUESTION*

What specifically do you object to?

The

19 fact that -- the Act saying that they must consider certain
20 things, put certain things on their agenda?
21

MR. ALSTON:

Mr. Justice White, they completely set

22 up an agenda for the state of Mississippi, and I was just
23 going to go over that before the question was asked by Mr.
24 Chief Justice.
25

It starts out in Section 111, "The state of

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 Mississippi is ordered...”

You are hereby required —

2 Section 111 says — to consider very, very complicated
9

3 rate-making standards.

Okay.

Section 113 says "You

4 must..." you are absolutely required, public service
5 commission, to consider all of these other standards, six or
6 eight standards.
7

Turning now to 302, 303 in the gas section, it says

8 "You must...” consider all of these standards.

Not only

9 that, if the Court please, it tells you the procedure.

It

10 sets the agenda for my public service commission, tells of
11 the procedures that I have to follow.
12
h

Also, if these procedures disagee with what the

13 procedures of the Act are, they override state law.

It's

14 interesting, too, the Act says, that the purposes of this
15 Act supplement state law.

Difficult to me to see how the

16 federal government can supplement the state law to give our
17 public service commissioners additional discretion.
18

But the Act goes further.

They mandate, they order

19 that we do this, they tell the procedures that we're going
20 to have to follow.

In addition to that, if you turn to

21 Section 115, if the Court please, it says, here's the
22 evidence you've got to look at when you consider these
23 standards.

)

24
25 the Act.

You go to 210 — 210 is not just a minor section of
It says the state tax commission shall give notice

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and hearing and implement the rules as promulgated by the
2 federal government, in connection with 210.
3

As far as any enforcement of the Act is concerned,

4 I submit that the Solicitor General was just wrong in his
5 answer to the Court, because as a matter of fact, under
6 Section 123 it says any person can enforce upon the state
7 tax commission what the Act is about.
8

You turn to the Conference Report, and I just

9 happened to open to it when the Solicitor General was
10 speaking — the Conference Report says specifically, this
11 enforcement provision of obligation of state regulatory
12 authorities and non-regulated utilities to hold hearings, to
13 make — comply — requirements A and B.
*

14

They are reviewable under the orders of this Court,

15 and they may be forced — the enforcement provision
16 contemplates enforcement by writs of mandamus.

Furthermore,

17 under —
18

QUESTION;

19

HR. ALSTON:

Yes.

The Act, in 123, if the Court

20 please, says they can enforce these provisions; any person
21 can enforce these provisions.
22

What does that mean, can enforce the

23 provisions?

HR. ALSTON:

25 Conference Report says, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION*

Well, any person couldn't do that

4 without a case or a controversy.

I mean, just some wiseacre

5 off the street couldn't go in and enforce it.
6

MR. ALSTONS

Yes.

So who —

The statute says any person,

7 including the Secretary, speaking of the Secretary of Energy
8 may bring an action to enforce the requirements of this
9 title in the appropriate state court.
10

QUESTION;

In the appropriate state court.

11

MR. ALSTON:

12

QUESTION;

Yes.
So he could bring an action in his own

13 name against the regulatory commission seeking an order or
14 an injunction or a writ of mandamus to make them carry out
15 their obligations under the Act.

That's the way you read

16 the Act.
17

MR. ALSTON:

That's exactly the way I read it, if

18 the Court pleases.
19

QUESTION:

Has any such action ever been brought,

20 do you know?
21

MR. ALSTON:

Not that I know of.

22

Furthermore, under Section 210 — that's under

23 Titles I and III.

Furthermore, under Section 210 they are

24 subject to' civil and criminal penalties, they are subject to
25 any penalty under the Federal Power Act.

In turning to the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 Federal Power Act, refusal to comply with the provisions
2 would subject you to the penalties under that.
3

QUESTIONS

If the Act had said we request, rather

4 than order, and some state utility commission had complied
5 with the request but rejected all — and went through the
6 motions but then -- would you object to the Secretary having
7 the right to appeal and challenge the agency decision?
8

MS. ALSTON*

9

QUESTION;

I believe I would, Your Honor.
Under the Tenth Amendment?

I know you

10 object to it, but would —
11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. ALSTON;

Yes, I believe, because — Mr. Justice

13 White, are you talking about the intervention in the court
14 proceedings and appeal from that?
15

QUESTION*

I meant he can appear before the agency,

16 I gather.
17

MR. ALSTON*

18

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.
And suppose the agency has voluntarily

19 gone through these motions.

They have been requested to but

20 not ordered to, and they go through the motions.
21 consider all these things.

They reject them all.

They
And the

22 Secretary says, well, you certainly made a mistake; I'm
23 going to go to court, I'm going to take you up.

And they

24 say go ahead.
25

Would you say that’s unconstitutional?

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ALSTON

I think, it would

The fact that he

2 can intervene in my state proceedings, and the fact that
3 this is not consistent with the law of the state — you have
4 to have a hearing, a determination, whether someone can
5 intervene in any state proceedings, if the Court please.
6 That flies in the face of the principles and the procedures
7 of our courts.
8

And then if he could appeal any of these decisions,

9 — as a matter of fact, this appeal causes me some concern,
10 Mr. Justice White, because if, really and truly, the federal
11 government didn’t care whether these were implemented or
12 not, if they did care, why did they give them a right to
13 appeal?
14

QUESTION:

Well, what do you conceive the issue to

15 be on appeal, say, before one of your state courts?

Or do

16 you ordinarily hear an appeal from the utility commission?
17

MR. ALSTON:

I guess the issue on appeal would be

18 whether or not the decision of the public service commission
19 was arbitrary or capricious and not based on the proper
20 standard, if the Court please, not based on substantial
21 evidence.
22

QUESTION;

So you think it would just be the

23 ordinary state standard, and would vary from state to state,
24 I suppose?
25

MR. ALSTON:

It would vary from state to state

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) ,554-2345

1 except that the procedure itself would be highly changed in
2 connection with the state in the proceeding before the
3 public service commission.

Because the rules of evidence

4 and every other part of it would go into the question of
5 whether or not the action was reasonable or based on
6 substantial evidence.
7

QUESTION*

I gather from that, the ultimate

8 decision of your highest state court would not be reviewable
9 here?
10

MB. ALSTON*

I think it would be reviewable under

11 the Act all the way up to the United States Supreme Court,
12 as by writs of certiorari and otherwise.

Review of the

13 action in the Supreme Court in accordance with Sections 1257

MR. ALSTON*

A federal question would be perhaps,

21 if we said we would not let the Secretary of Energy
22 intervene, perhaps.
23

QUESTION*

That —
Maybe, but he intervenes.

He intervenes

24 and the court affirms the rejection of all the federal
25 standards.

Secondly, if the Court please, we fail

We failed to do that.

24

MR. ALSTON*

25

QUESTION:

That's true.
Let me ask.

Could a consumer in

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 Mississippi raise the same question in some of your agency
2 procedures?

Could a consumer come in and file a petition

3 and say I’d like to ask the commission to adopt a rule
4 against declining block rates, or whatever they are,
5 time-a-day rates — .
6

MR. ALSTON;

I think the rule is 25 consumers under

7 certain procedures, under the procedures set up by the
8 court, could come in and ask for changes in the rules and
9 rate-making —
10

QUESTION;

Would it have been constitutional for

11 Congress to pass a statute saying that the Secretary of
12 Energy can direct 25 federal employees within the city of
13 Jackson to file such a petition?
14

MR. ALSTON;

Who are all consumers.

I don't know that I know the answer to

15 that question.
16

QUESTION;

Under the procedures, you'd be required

17 to consider the standard.
18

MR. ALSTON;

Yes.

If 25 consumers came before

19 them, they would have to make the decision of whether or not
20 they wanted to proceed further with whatever was before
21 them, the agency, at that time.
22

If it please the Court, we contend that this — the

23 manner in which this Act was written is most unique.

They

24 did not follow, the federal government did not follow, the
25 provisions as they followed, or the scheme that they

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1

followed in all of the other regulatory provisions.

They

2 gave the state the option of whether or not — as they did
3

in the Surface Mining case, if the Court please -- the

4

option of whether or not they would desire to follow the

5

procedures or not, and gave them the right to get out.

They

6 didn't want to.
7

Under those circumstances, the federal government,

8 at that point, would take over the whole administration of
9

that area.

This is entirely different from what we are

10

talking about today.

11

trying to find some statute or some authority — and

12

certainly the Solicitor General hasn't given me any

13

authority — that would be constitutional where a statute is

14

mandated on a state regulatory commission and they are

15

required to follow the mandates of that statute.

16

matter of fact, they commandeer the public service

17

commission's machinery into going about this Act.

And as a

ME. ALSTON;

The Solicitor General admitted that it

7

4 believe, in 1977 that the issue was moot.
5

The only other time that I can recall anything that

6 has been considered, if the Court please, is when Congress
7 was attempting to pass no-fault insurance.

And I remember

8 that the then-Attorney General Edward Levy was asked what
9 his opinion on the constitutionality of requiring certain
10 affirmative obligation on the state, and he was quick to
11 tell Congress in those hearings that indeed, they could not.

)

QUESTION;

Mr. Alston, would you agree that at

13 least some portion of Section 210 simply preempt, as a
14 matter of federal law, some applicable rules and don't pose
15 a Tenth Amendment problem?

Would you agree with that?

That

16 certainly some sections of Section 210 don't have that kind
17 of a —
18

MR. ALSTON;

Your Honor, I do agree with that.

I

19 think Section (e) could have been passed separately, and I
20 think that would be severable, so that the small power
21 plants and the cogeneration could be exempted from the
22 Federal Power Act.
23
7

I would think that primarily 210 was executed so

24 that the federal government would implement these rules and
25 the states were forced to comply with these rules to see

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that the utilities followed the federal mandate.
2

QUESTION;

Do you think that Section 210 would

3 significantly hinder states in their ability to perform
4 other functions?
5

MR. ALSTON;

I think that they would significantly

6 impair the state of Mississippi and the public service
7 commission in their choices.

Section 210, they have not

8 chosen to go into the area that’s mentioned in Section 210.
9 As a matter of fact, they don't even have authority to go
10 into — in some of the areas that are mentioned in 210, they
11 have no jurisdiction whatsoever over interstate rates.
12

For example, in purchasing power from a small power

13 plant, that would be an interstate transaction, as I
14 understand the law on it.

The only authority the

15 Mississippi Public Service Commission has would be to -- for
16 the regulation of interstate rates.
17

QUESTION;

Do you think that Congress could say not

18 only consider these, but what if Congress just said we find
19 that it is essential to regulation of commerce that in
20 ratemaking, state public utilities commissions shall follow
21 the following standard.
22 is.
23

And it just says what the standard

They don’t say consider it, they prescribe it.
MR. ALSTON*

Do I consider that to be

24 constitutional under the Tenth Amendment?
25 not.

No, sir, I would

sovereignty of the state.

QUESTION*

Hell, would you say that a — there are

5

a lot of federal laws that affect the rates that a public

6

utility commission can allow.

7

MR. ALSTON*

I*m not familiar of any such law.

The

8 interstate rates that are promulgated by the Mississippi
9

Public Service Commission are promulgated under the

10

authority of the Mississippi Public Service Commision, and I

11

don’t know of any federal law that would change —

12

QUESTION:

Do you think the federal law could limit

13

the ratemaking activities of the — say in the railroad

business?

18 prohibited throughout the United States because we make
19 findings that they use up too much energy?

Could they do

20 that?
21

MR. ALSTON;

It's a possibility.

That's not

22 putting an affirmative burden.
23

Well, it's an affirmative prohibition.

That's it.

spelled out in the findings.
MR. ALSTON*

That perhaps would be constitutional

if that was — if they didn’t tell the state tax commission

about the rules and it was certainly just the statement that

And

You apparently, if you say that rule was

5

MS. ALSTONS

6

QUESTION:

7 v. Katt reliance?

I don’t know of any enforcement.
How about the Solicitor General’s Testa

There, certainly, the federal government

8 prescribed a rule of decision and said a state court had to
9 follow it.
10

QUESTION;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don’t think

11 Testa v. Katt applies at all in this case.

As I read the

12 case, I see it is that a state court simply cannot
13 discriminate in a federal cause of action if they hear state
14 causes of action under the same cause.
15

Of course, the statute that we’re talking about

16 goes much further.

The statute that is before the Court

17 today, it first is an administrative agency, it is not a
18 court, to start off with. This is a legislative functioning,
19 it’s ratemaking, it’s legislative in Mississippi, and these
20 are affirmative burdens placed on the Mississippi Public
21 Service Commission.
22

That’s a far cry from what Testa v. Katt is being

23 cited for.

Secondly, it would seem to me that certainly,

24 the public service commission wouldn’t even have
25 jurisdiction over the question of wholesale rates in that

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202),554-2345

1 connection, and certainly Testa v. Katt would never say that
2 you can force jurisdiction on a court such as this.
3

There's no doubt that a statute such as we are

4 talking about is attractive to Congress.

I can see where

5 they can say that they do not want to take care of the
6 burden of enforcing it, and put it on the states to
7 enforce.

This is where we say that you run into the

8 questions of Federalism, and this is where we say that we
9 run into trouble.
10

QUESTIONS

Hr. Alston, the statute may also be more

11 attractive to many states than the alternative of total
12 federal regulation, wouldn't you say?
13

HR. ALSTON:

14 attractive or not.
15 question.

I don't know whether it would be more
I don't know how to answer that

I know it's not more attractive to the state of

16 Hississippi.

I know it's not more attractive to the state

17 of Louisiana, that also has filed an amicus brief in this
18 case.
19

QUESTION:

Federal preemption would be preferable,

20 then.
21

HR. ALSTON:

No, I'm certainly not saying federal

22 preemption would be preferable.

But I'm making the

23 distinction in opposition to what the Solicitor General.

He

24 said if you could preempt, of course, you have authority to
25 do all of these things against state agencies.

I say that

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 just does not follow.
2

Certainly, if you preempt that puts the burden on

3 the national government.

Under our system of Federalism I

4 know who to look to for my rate structure.
5

QUESTION:

I suggest to you that there is that

6 middle ground of preemption, and instead of taking over the
7 whole regulatory job you just mandate a series of standards
8 that must be followed.

There shall be time-of-day rates

9 everywhere, or, they go right through the list.
10 this is what the rule of the game is.

They say

That doesn't — and

11 if that’s constitutional, that doesn't mean the federal
12 government is taking over the regulation.
13

MR. ALSTON;

But what it does. Your Honor, I think

14 it runs completely afoul to the three tests of Hodel.
15 first, they are tailing the state as a state what to do.
16 Certainly, —
17

QUESTION:

They tell them the rules of the game,

18 that’s right.
19

MR. ALSTON:

And they’re telling them how to follow

20 it, the rules they’ve got to play, what they've got to
21 consider.
22 rules.

They’ve got to let anybody intervene under the

As a matter of fact, the purposes supplement state

23 law, the procedures would override state law.

In addition

24 to that, it involves attributes of state sovereignty.
25 That's the paradigm of state sovereignty, the ability to

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 pass laws and to pass regulations.

Thirdly, we contend that it significantly impairs

3 the ability of the state —
4

QUESTIONS

Is a highway patrolman in Mississippi

5 bound to enforce the 55 mile speed limit, or do you know?

MR. ALSTON:

Yes, sir, he is.

Of course, that's

8 money from federal funds, we —

10 that it?

QUESTION:

Is

11 supported by the federal government?

What about — is a

12 state officer required to enforce —
13

MR. ALSTON;

Yes, sir, would be to enforce the 55

14 mile an hour speed limit.
15

QUESTION;

Even if it isn't tied with a grant for

16 federal highways?
17

MR. ALSTON:

If it was not tied to the grant to

18 federal highways, I don't know that he would be.
19

QUESTION:

Well, if the 55 mile an hour speed limit

20 is one promulgated by Mississippi because it feels that
21 otherwise it would lose its federal highway entitlement —
22

MR. ALSTON;

23

QUESTION:

That's true.
Let's assume — I took Justice White's

24 question to be — that if there were no grants involved and
25 this wasn't a quid pro quo, a condition of the grant, if

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 there is a federal statute for 55 mile speed limit for the
2 purpose of conserving gasoline and energy in the national
3 interest, in your view, must Mississippi enforce that or
4 does it have a choice?
5

MR. ALSTONs

I don't know if it would be necessary

6 that it enforce that obligation .

I am not sure that you can

7 force a state officer to enforce a federal regulation of
8 that nature.
9

QUESTIONS

Even if they’re related to commerce and

10 the national security?
11

MR. ALSTON:

Even if they have made that claim?
And the 55 mile speed limit is

12 applicable to all of them?

I would think then under those

13 circumstances that he would, if the Court please.
14

QUESTIONS

15

MR. ALSTON:

16

QUESTION*

Would be enforced?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Alston, let's back up a minute.

17 Doesn't your public service commission feel itself bound by
18 the Due Process Clause of the Constitution?
19

MR. ALSTON:

I think we all are bound by the Due

20 Process Clause.
21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ALSTON:

So that's — so it's not absolutely free.
That is absolutely so.

We are bound

23 by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.

And the

24 public service commission -25

QUESTION:

I hear you talking about mandamus.

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

Do

1 you have mandamus in your state laws?
2

MR. ALSTON;

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. ALSTON;

5

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Right now.
Yes, sir.
So that's not anything new, either, is

6 it?
7

MR. ALSTON;

Mandamus is an old remedy, if the

8 Court please, that we have followed for a long time.
9

QUESTION;

I thought so.

And it would apply

10 against the public service commission under the right state
11 of facts.
12

MR. ALSTON;

And under the right state of facts,

13 they could.
14

QUESTION;

And without this provision you read from

15 the report.
16

MR. ALSTON;

Mandamus would apply if the public

17 service commission did not comply with administerial duties
18 in doing certain things; the writ of mandamus may just apply.
19

In conclusion, I just wanted to state that

20 certainly, it's no question the government recognizes that
21 these mandates are forced on state's estates.

Certainly,

22 the right to make the laws of the state of Mississippi,
23 certainly the right to promulgate the regulations of the
24 state of Mississippi, is an attribute of sovereignty.
25 is the attribute of sovereignty.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) ,554-2345

That

We further contend that certainly, this impairs,

2 the Act impairs the ability of the state of Mississippi to
3 structure its integral operations in area of traditional
4 functions, and this is indeed a

traditional function.

AFTERNOON SESSION

(1;00 p.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Mr. Lee, do you have

4 rebuttal?
5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — Rebuttal

7

MR. LEE*

Two brief matters.

First of all, the

8 FERC regulations were promulgated in February of 1980.
9 Second, and finally, aside from whatever this Court's
10 decision in National League of Cities and Towns v. Usery,
11 may mean in another context, we simply submit that it should
12 not apply whereas here, you have a true example of
13 cooperative Federalism, where Congress is sharing some of
14 its authority with the states in the interest of both
15 federal and state government and out of plea in response to
16 the request of the states.
17

And that, at a minimum, must be what this Court's

18 articulation of a balancing test, both in National League of
19 Cities and Towns and also in Hodel, means.
20

With regard to Titles I and III, Congress clearly

21 could have set the rates if it had chosen to do so.

What an

22 anomaly it would be if the Tenth Amendment were to become
23 the vehicle for preventing Congress from responding to state
24 pleas for flexibility and experimentation in the perceived
25 interest of both federal and state governments to give

1

States

a

larger

role

in

that

particular

governmental

2 function.
3

With regard to Section 210, Hr. Alston

4 distinguished Testa v. Katt on the ground that no state
5 functions were displaced.
6 either.

Really, they haven't been here,

The states are given several options as to what

7 they can do, but they are not required to bring into
8 existence any new entity of government.

They are not

9 required to have any of their existing public service
10 commissions perform any functions that they are not now
11 performing.
12

The obligation imposed by Section 210 and the

13 implementing regulations can be performed by simply
14 entertaining disputes before appropriate adjudicatory
15 entities.

And that does not mean that any new entity must

16 be brought into existence.

That point is made, for example,

17 with respect to Nebraska, which has no public utility
18 commission with authority to set rates.

In Nebraska,

19 presumably, that responsibility can be performed simply by
20 entertaining that kind of suit before the courts.
21
22 says.

And that, at a very minimum, is what Testa v. Katt
And in that respect. Testa v. Katt is

23 indistinguishable, that states are simply required to
24 observe a federal rule of decision that is prescribed by the
25 federal government but to be observed in state proceedings.

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1

QUESTION:

In that respect, you analogize it, I

2 suppose, to the 55 mile an hour hypothetical that we
3 proposed.
4

MR. LEEs

Yes.

And clearly, Mr. Chief Justice, if

5 the federal government has the authority under the Spending
6 Clause to impose that kind of an obligation on the states,
7 then clearly, under its —
8

QUESTION:

Would that be purely under the Spending

9 Clause, or under the Commerce Clause?
10

MR. LEE:

Well, the Spending Clause or the Commerce

11 Clause.

Then clearly, if you take into account the kind of

12 balancing and recognition of the comparative weights of
13 federal and state interests, particularly where in many
14 instances, in the view of many states in this case, they are
15 identical, then Congress certainly, in light of that
16 balancing approach, should have that kind of flexibility.
17

And if it has that kind of power under the Taxing

18 and Spending and the Commerce Clauses over a 55 mile an hour
19 speed limit, then clearly, under its powers over national
20 security it should have the flexibility to deal in as
21 cooperative Federalism approach as it has in 1978.
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, are you disturbed

23 at all by the breadth of the Standing Clauses in this
24 statute?

Clauses that provide standing for, in one section,

25 any consumer of electricity, which means every citizen,

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) .554-2345

1 really; and in another section, standing for any person
2 providing attorney's fees and other reasonable expenses?

A

3 field day for lawyers, at least.
4

Are there other federal statutes that have gone

5 that far in changing the state rules of standing before
6 regulatory commissions, or courts?
7

MB. LEE;

Well, of course, those are problems that

8 will have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis as those
9 matters come before the state.

Since most of the

10 proceedings are going to be in state court, it is not the
11 Article III case or controversy requirement that will apply,
12 but rather, state rules.

And in my view, they're governed

13 by state law.
