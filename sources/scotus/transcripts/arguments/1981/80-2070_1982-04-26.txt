ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAM CHAYES, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF SUMITOMO SHOJI AMERICA, INC.

7

MR. CHAYES:

9

We will hear arguments

please the Court,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

this case concerns the international

10

obligations of the United States under the Treaty of

11

Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Japan and

12

similar treaties with many other countries, an

13

obligation to permit a foreign investor to manage and

14

control its investment in this country by engaging

15

executives and other specialists of its choice.
Sumitomo Shoji America is a company organized

16
17

and existing under the laws of the State of New York.

18

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Japan, a

19

general trading company or Sogo Shoji, with more than

20

100 offices around the world.

allege that Sumitomo discriminated against them by

2

restricting them to clerical positions on the ground

3

that they were women, and second, in Paragraph

4

Sumitomo had discriminated against them by restricting

5

them to clerical positions on the ground cf their

6

nationality.

13, that

Sumitomo answered denying the claims of

7
8

discrimination and asserting that its employment

9

practices challenged in the complaint were authorized by

10

the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty, and on

11

this basis Sumitomo moved to dismiss the complaint for

12

failure to state a claim on which relief could be

13

granted.

14

The district court denied this motion, holding

15

that Sumitomo as a New York company was not entitled to

16

the benefit of the Treaty.

17

for interlocutory appeal under Section 1292(b) of the

18

judicial code.

19

Circuit reversed the district court.

20

the Fifth Circuit in a substantially identical case,

21

Spiess versus C. Itoh, Incorporated, that a wholly owned

22

U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese investor could indeed

23

invoke the protection of the Treaty, but contrary to the

24

Fifth Circuit, the Second Circuit went on to hold that

25

on the merits the Treaty did not preclude examination

That question was certified

On the issue certified, the Second

under Title VII of Sumitomo’s employment practices with

2

respect to senior personnel.
On this ground, it affirmed the district

3
4

court’s denial of the motion to dismiss, and we took our

5

petition for certiorari from that decision.

6

Now, I want to go directly to the Treaty

7

issues that I think are at the heart of this case.

8

Indeed, in my view, the deeper question of this case is

9

whether the United States will faithfully carry out

10

Treaty obligations undertaken with two dozen foreign

11

countries, obligations that it placed in the Treaty and

12

placed in the Treaty for its own purposes.
There are two issues under the Treaty, two

13
14

components to the Treaty question.

The first is who may

15

invoke the employment right under the Treaty, and the

16

second is what is the scope of that right.

17

first, who may invoke the right, I think that need not

18

detain us long.

19

wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign investor was

20

entitled to the benefit of the employment right.

21

why?

22

any sound reason or basis in policy for distinguishing

23

in terms of the employment right between foreign

24

investment carried out through a branch and foreign

25

investment carried out through a locally organized

As to the

Both courts of appeals decided that a

QUESTION:

2

3

I suppose. Professor Chayes, you

would carry that down to a subsidiary of a subsidiary.
KB. CHAYES:

4

Well, I think that is true.

That

5

is our — our position is that the foreign investor has

6

a right to manage and control his investment in the

7

United States by engaging executive personnel of his

8

choice, and if his investment is — takes the form of a

9

subsidiary of a subsidiary, the answer is the same.
QUESTION;

10

What about a subsidiary, if you

11

want to call it that, owned 40 percent by a foreign

12

parent, or 55 percent?
MR. CHAYES;

13
14

bother me.

Fifty-five percent wouldn't

The regulations —

15

QUESTION:

How wouldn't it bother you?

16

MR. CHAYES:

Well, the regulations under the

17

Immigration and Naturalization Act provide and have

18

provided always that a 51-percent controlled subsidiary

19

has the nationality of the state of its owner.

20

go below that, below 51 percent, then you are not

21

talking about a controlled subsidiary, and it is the

22

right to control and manage the investment that is at

23

stake.

24

Article VII says that the foreign investor has the right

25

to invest in this country in any lawful juridical form.

If you

If you look at Article VII of the Treaty,

Well, it is hard to say —
At least the legal advisor's name

is on the brief.
MR. CHAYES*

Yes.

I was going to say, it is

8

hard to say in whose behalf the brief on the part of the

9

United States was filed, because --

Or whom it supports.

MR. CHAYES*

Yes, or whom it supports.

It seems to be that the brief

4

discloses a compromise between various points of view in

5

the government, and that is what I would like to say on

6

this branch of the case.

and subsidiary investment.

adduce a reason why one should distinguish between

investment carried out through branches or investment

21

carried out through subsidiaries.

22

On the contrary, the major objective of these

23

treaties, post-World War Two treaties, was to

24

accommodate investment through locally incorporated

25

subsidiaries.

That was a new element in 1952, although

in a moment —

(General laughter.)

12

MR. CHAYES*

— but I want to say that as late

13

as July, 1979, the State Department said that an

14

interpretation of the Treaty that would exclude locally

incorporated subsidiaries would gut the Treaty of much

16

of its value for the United States.

QUESTION:

What are the differences

2

functionally between the two types of structures, the

3

subsidiary and the branch?

4

MB. CHAYES:

Well, of course, the subsidiary

5

is a corporation.

6

taxed as a separate entity, and so on.

7

part of the foreign enterprise, and it does not have

8

limited liability.

9

jurisdiction of a foreign enterprise, and so on.

10
11

12

13

It has limited liability.

QUESTION:

For the purposes we are here today,

what do you think are the critical differences?
MR. CHAYES:

I think, there are no differences

for the purposes we are here today.
QUESTION:

MR. CHAYES:

QUESTION:

Functionally, they are the same.
Functionally, none, and —
There may be — conceivably there

might be some tax consequences of being one or the other?
MR. CHAYES:

Well, yes, but not for the

19

purposes of employment. Your Honor.

20

Article VI-C, it says, first, the foreign investor may

21

establish branches.

22

establish locally incorporated subsidiaries, and then

23

VI-1-C says, it may manage and control its enterprises

24

without distinguishing at all between them.

1

Justice White's question, because I do think it is

2

important to see that although the State Department

3

doesn't want to call us the company of Japan for the

4

purposes of Article VIII, it is perfectly willing that

5

we should have the benefits of Article VIII protection

6

derivatively, so to speak, through the right of our

7

parent.

8

United States in its summary of argument, it says that

9

in so many words.

10

If you look at Page 6 of the brief of the

Accordingly, it says, as a wholly Japanese

11

owned trading company, Sumitomo may continue to obtain

12

the services of Japanese nationals to the extent they

13

qualify for treaty trade or visas under the standards

14

described above even if the court concludes that

15

Sumitomo is not a company of Japan that may invoke the

16

special employment privileges of the Treaty, and you

17

will find similar expressions scattered throughout the

18

State Department's brief, wherever one side or the other

19

won the particular negotiating battle.

20

21
22

QUESTIONS

How would you distinguish that

statement from a functional analysis?
MR. CHAYESs

I would not at all, sir.

I would

23

say that that — we are perfectly prepared that this

24

Court should decide that we are a company of Japan for

25

the purposes of Article VIII, or that we get the right

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

derivatively from the right of the parent.

We have no

2

vested interest in which rationale the Court uses to

3

reach that result, and as we suggested in our brief, the

4

courts below apparently look both ways on the question

5

of rationale, and they do so for the very reason you

6

say. Your Honor, because functionally there is no

7

difference.

8

investor to manage and control has got to be the same

9

and was designed to be the same in this Treaty, whether

Functionally, the right of the foreign

10

his investment took the form of a branch or of a

11

subsidiary.
Now, I would like, therefore, Your Honor,

Hay I just interrupt with one

15

question?

16

XXII perform in your view?

17

What function does the definition in Article

HR. CHAYES:

Well, that, as you see from the

18

briefs, is the subject of a lot of scholastic exigesis.

19

I think that it performs a function that has not been

20

very fully called to our attention, and that is this.

21

think Article XXII was really designed to say what

22

companies of — what kinds of enterprises or entities in

23

the foreign country did we have to recognize, and

24

conversely,

25

the Japanese have to recognize, and all this talk about

what kinds of entities in our country did

a single simple case is not a test about the nationality

2

of the company.
It is really a test about what kind of entity

3
4

in the foreign milieu we have to recognize as a company,

5

and the reason why this article was drafted in these

6

terms was that previously, previously in the U.S.

7

Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with

8

Germany, for example, or with Japan, the Treaties in the

9

19 teens and the twenties, a whole series of

10

requirements were established before a company could

11

claim recognition by the other party.

Japanese when they have to recognize my enterprise, and

that is when it is incorporated in the other party’s —

21

little or nothing to do, I think, Hr. Justice Stevens,

22

with what we have to do about companies organized under

23

our own laws.

24
25

Let’s have a simple test that tells me when I

It has

But even if you take that view, then it seems
to me, as I said before, it may be that the State

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Department has some concerns about calling a company

2

organized under the United States, a "company of Japan"

3

for the purposes of Article VIII, because that may have

4

a carry-over, a carry-over effect in other parts of the

5

Treaty, but in fact, the State Department says, you can

6

get there by a different route.

7

it is the parent that is —

MR. CHAYES:

QUESTION;

Excuse me, sir?
Don't they just say that for tire

13

All you have to say is,

No.
— individuals who would be treaty

traders?
MR. CHAYES:

No, sir.

I think they say,

17

again, if you want to look at another example, the

18

government's brief at Page, I think, 21, "Because

19

Sumitomo's parent corporation" -- I am reading now down

20

at the bottom — "apparently is a company of Japan" —

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CHAYES;

23

Where are you reading?
Down at the bottom of the

government's brief at Page 21, sir.

24

QUESTION;

Twenty-one.

25

MR. CHAYES:

Yes.

Okay.

And it says, "apparently a

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

denies that Sumitomo Japan is a company of Japan.

3

parent might well have discretion protected by the

4

Treaty to select Japanese nationals for certain top

5

level managerial positions in Sumitomo through the

6

exercise of the parent's right under Article XIII-1 to

7

engage executive personnel."
QUESTION;

I don't think there is anybody who

that we have the right to engage anything other than

Well, maybe you are going to tell

19

me what the Treaty means, then.

20

MR. CHAYES;

That’s right.

I want to talk

21

about what the scope of the treaty right is, because I

22

honestly think there isn't much substance to the

23

argument that whatever the Treaty right is, this company

24

doesn't get the benefit of it.

25

scope of the Treaty right, I want to make two points.

And in talking about the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

First, Sumitomo is not claiming a general immunity from

2

Title VII.
We are speaking only of a narrow group of top

3
4

executives and specialists necessary to manage and

5

control the investment, and second, I think it is

6

essential to keep in mind that these employment rights

7

were put in the Treaty not by the Japenese, not by the

8

Germans, not by the Danish, not by the Israelis, but by

9

the United States.

We were the draftsmen of this

10

Treaty, and what we wanted out of Article VIII of this

11

Treaty is also stated in the government's brief.
It appears in Footnote 14 at Page 24-25, and

12

13

what we wanted was, it says, the purpose of Article VIII

14

was to override these restrictions, host country

15

restrictions on employment of aliens, and I am quoting

16

now, "so that American businessmen operating abroad

17

would be able to select U.S. nationals for essential

18

positions," and that is the right that Sumitomo is

19

seeking.

20

Now, to define the scope of that right, as I

21

say, I think the government in sort of general terms

22

accepts that statement of what the right is, but then

23

they say, oh, well, on this record we can't say that all

24

these people that occupy challenged positions are really

25

executive personnel, are really specialists of the kind

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

WASHINGTON n C 90094 f909^ SK4-934K

1

mentioned in the treaty, so we have got to send the

2

whole thing back for a case by case examination of what

3

these executive positions amount to and what these

4

specialist positions amount to.

5

Your Honors, we believe that that question can

6

be settled as a matter of law on this record by this

7

Court, and it can be settled if we expand our horizon a

8

little bit and take into account additional legal

9

materials that are not referred to by the government,

10

and essentially the legal materials involved are the

11

Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 and the

12

regulations thereunder.

MR. CHAYES:

Hell, it is executive personnel

attorneys, agents, and other specialists of their choice.

3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MR. CHAYES:

Hell, Mr. Justice Stevens, let me

5

say that if we had nothing but the Treaty to go on, that

6

would be a fair or a possible reading, but we do have

7

more than the Treaty to go on, and that is what I am

8

trying to bring into the picture right now.

9

QUESTION:

But what I am really asking, you

10

don’t construe their brief as conceding that those two

11

concepts are coextensive.

12

MR. CHAYES:

I do not, and I am saying that on

13

the face — we don’t have to confine ourselves to the

14

face of the Treaty, because we’ve got the Immigration

15

and Naturalization Act, which was passed at the same

16

time, contemporaneously.

17

Immigration and Naturalization Act was the part of the

18

Immigration and Naturalization Act designed to carry out

19

these provisions of the Treaty, and if you look at that

20

section of the Act and the regulations promulgated

21

thereunder, they evidence contemporaneous and continuous

22

contemporaneous statute by which the Congress attempted

this Treaty when they had to administer it.

there are interpretative notes, and as you look at the

provided in the government's brief at Appendix B-A, I

will see what it says about executives, and it says they

do have to be top executives in order to qualify for a

isn't whether they should have been let into the country

9

to afford a defense to a Title VII action.
MR. CHAYES*

10

Our argument, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, is that it has been determined by the

12

consular officer that they do qualify under the Treaty.

13

Now you say, well, why shouldn't we review that

the determination ought not to be reviewed, not because

it wouldn’t be a nice thing to have a review of this

Hr. Chayes, may I ask you another

question that troubles me about the way in which the

appeal was just on the issue of what kind of a company

12

is the subsidiary.

their own choice.

Well, it is that, sir, that —
-- and it is perfectly clear that

everything can be resolved beyond the first issue.
HR. CHAYES:

20

Hr. Justice Stevens, that is our

21

position.

Our position is that the Treaty, which might

22

be ambiguous on its face, is defined in the Immigration

23

and Naturalization Act that was passed to implement it,

24

and in the regulations thereunder, and all those issues

25

are determined as a matter of law.

that this Court has been very careful,

QUESTIONS

11

Yes, but as Mr. Justice Rehnq'uist

12

points out, it is quite one thing — it is one thing to

13

say that these people may come in and work here, give

14

them permission to come, and quite another thing to say

15

that that necessarily means that no woman in New York

16

can be eligible for any of these jobs, which is in fact

17

what they are claiming.
MR. CHAYES;

18

Well, our reply to that is quite

19

different.

We say that we are entitled to executives of

20

our choice — I am sorry, I will have to answer your

21

question — as long as we have somebody we want to put

22

there and we can get an E-1 visa for him.

23

him out of there and don't substitute another person

with an E-1

If we take

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I am sorry to have gone over --

women below was a Japanese national, was she not?

We —

There are two answers to that.

13

QUESTION*

So Title VII applies to her.

14

MR. CHAYES*

Well, there are two answers to

15

that question. Your Honor.

In the first place, we

16

conceded, and it appears in our reply brief, that as to

17

that person, the Japanese national, who was a plaintiff,

18

female Japanese national, she might have a claim that

19

withstands a motion to dismiss, but on the other hand --

20

and so that concession stands in the record, and, I

21

think, meets your question, but on the other hand, if

22

you are talking about executive personnel of their

23

choice, and you are talking about how a Japanese company

24

manages its top executives worldwide, it does seem to me

25

that this Court might wish to hesitate before it imposed

our notions, to which I subscribe wholeheartedly, of

2

non-discrimination, on decisions taken by Japanese

3

companies in Japan to send people to the United States,

4

but that is by the side.
The main answer to your question. Justice

5

O'Connor, is that we have conceded that as to her, a

claim that is proof against 12(d)(6) has been stated.

5

person in that company with the exception of a few white

males, except clericals, so that we have a real live

7

issue on that score which in no way has been answered by

8

the pleadings, and must be answered by a trial on the

merits .

10

I would like to say that we are presenting

11

here two propositions.

12

Shoji America is a domestic corporation, and therefore

13

it has no rights under Article VIII of the Treaty.

14

is, the of their choice provision.

15

that even if Article VIII were to applv to an American

16

subsidiary, then the of their choice language would not

17

exempt Sumitomo from American civil rights laws, and

18

would not grant it a license to discriminate.

Second, we claim

Mr. Steel, what would you suggest

are the differences functionally between a branch and a

you could have questions as to immunity from

20

There may well be some advantages which have

One of them could be in the field of tax.
Thirdly,

It seems to me there are many possibilities

21

why a parent in Japan might well choose the protection

22

of using a corporate form here, a domestic corporate

23

form rather than appearing in this country as a branch,

24

and I think, that some of those have been developed in my

25

brief, some of those have been developed and alluded to,

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I think, in both the government brief and also in the

2

amicus AJC et al. brief, and I think those well could be

3

significant, but I don't think we have that burden of

4

trying to resolve that question because, contrary to

5

counsel for Sumitomo's statement that the Treaty is

6

ambiguous, it is not ambiguous at all.

7

Section 22-3 has a precise definition and

8

precisely states that companies such as Sumitomo will be

9

treated as American corporations, not corporations of

10

Japan, and Article VIII within the article refers to

11

situations involving both nationals and companies of

12

Japan in the very first sentence, which discusses the

13

"of their choice" right, and in a final sentence in the

14

very same subsection of Article VIII refers to a

15

situation where a subsidiary corporation would gain

16

certain rights, and

17

accountants and other experts are needed by the

18

subsidiary.

that is the situation where

19

So, you start out here in your analysis by

20

looking at this case from its plain language, and it

21

seems to me that once you do that, the burden is really

22

on Sumitomo to overcome a very clear situation, because

23

I do understand there are cases from this Court

24

indicating that you can look behind plain language, but

25

certainly plain language is very important.

Certainly,

22

23

carefully reviewed the documents in question and the

24

negotiating history.

25

QUESTION;

The court of appeals described both

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the letters as cursory, didn't it?
MR. STEEL?

2
3

They both certainly were short,

Your Honor, but when you —

4

(General laughter.)

5

MR. STEEL?

That is cursory.

I would have

6

liked from Mr. Atwood more detail.

I agree with that.

7

But you see, when you look at the Atwood letter, you

8

know, as we know now, that certain documents were

9

available to Atwood that apparently Marks didn't

10

consider.

For example, there is a very, very long

11

communication which we discuss in our brief relating to

12

the concept of subsidiaries being put into Article VI(4)
Now, you have a back and forth in the

13
14

correspondence between Japan and the United States about

15

Article

16

Article VI the way it was originally written would not

protect subsidiaries from certain problems, namely,

18

expropriation.

19

VI(4),

and the State Department concludes that

protection, VI(4) was put in, which put into that

section the concept of protecting a controlled

it seems to me that the letter is entitled to weight,

3

and we do know that after the Atwood letter, the

position of the State Department in conformity with the

5

Atwood letter was communicated to the government of

6

Denmark, and that letter is also in the record.

7

I would like to turn to a major argument of

8

counsel for Sumitomo.

Even though I believe that

9

Sumitomo, given the plain language of the Treaty, has

10

the burden of persuasion, counsel attempts to put that

11

burden on us, and says, we have not shown any reason

12

whatsoever for the distinction between branches and

13

14

I would suggest that if Your Honors look at

15

the section in our brief concerning legislative history.

16

which is the section involving what the State Department

17

representatives said to Senator Hickenlooper and his

18

committee when this Treaty and the series of treaties in

19

1952 were presented to that body, that -- those

20

questions and answers and those statements are very

21

significant, because they tell us what we all know from

22

understanding our history, and that was, back in 1950,

23

and throughout that entire period, the United States

24

Senate was very, very concerned about the rights of

25

Americans and American entities, and the mood of the

/
34

1

Senate was that it would object to treaties which

2

infringed upon American sovereignty at home.

3

Very clearly, the State Department

4

representatives, who not only had the burden of

5

convincing foreign governments to sign treaties, but

6

also had the burden of convincing the Senate to ratify

7

those treaties, was trying to do everything that it

8

could possibly do to let the Senate know that it was not

9

taking away from either the federal government or state

10

governments their traditional powers to regulate

11

corporations.

12

And if we have to speculate as to why people

13

would make that type of distinction between branches and

14

corporations, we have the dialogues in those two

15

hearings which tell us very, very clearly that Senator

16

Hickenlooper was extremely concerned lest this Treaty

17

would take away the traditional rights of the state

18

governments to regulate corporations, and each and every

19

time that question was asked of State Department

20

representatives over a period of two years, the State

21

Department representative made clear that this Treaty

22

and its companion Treaties would take nothing away from

23

the states to regulate — to regulate in this area.

24
25

{fow, that is very, very significant, because
in 1953, as we have pointed out in our brief, there were

35

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

States that had antidiscrimination laws.

2

were in effect, and it is clear that it was not the

3

purpose of Congress or of the Senate in ratifying these

4

treaties to in any way infringe upon the States of New

5

York, where Sumitomo is incorporated, to enforce its

6

law, or other states.

7

QUESTION*

Those laws

Do the states have any reciprocal

8

problems with other states of the United States that

9

Americans have with overseas operations?

I am

10

addressing now the reciprocity aspect that has been

11

mentioned of Article VIII.

12

HR. STEEL:

Well, let me say this.

Obviously,

13

the State of New York is not in the same situation as

14

the United States in terms of the fact that it doesn't

15

have a foreign policy to consider, but very, very

16

clearly it did have an antidiscrimination statute on its

17

books which meant a lot to it.

18

filed an amicus brief in this Court.

19

importantly, Senator Hickenlooper and his committee was

20

very concerned that these treaties would not erode the

21

powers of the states to regulate domestic corporations,

22

and that is precisely what Sumitomo America is, and I

23

suggest if we have to look for an answer as to why the

24

Treaty was structured in this way, we may well look to

25

those Congressional hearings.

You are going to -- He spent a lot

of time on that.
BE. STEEL;

9

Yes, I would like to turn my

10

attention to that, and I would like also in turning my

11

attention to that to refer to the Senate hearings which

12

is set forth on Page 23, I believe, of our brief, in

13

which when the Senate was considering this, the State

14

Department representatives said that the Treaty rights

15

were to be, and I quote, "upon as favorable terms", and

16

let me stop and underline that, "upon as favorable terms

17

as the nationals of the country, the right of the owner

18

to manage his own affairs and employ personnel of his

19

own choice."

20

Now, Sumitomo maintains that Article VIII sets

21

up a non-contingent right, that it is an absolute right,

22

and yet the State Department representative very clearly

23

told the Senate committee in question that the right was

24

to be upon as favorable terms as the nationals of the

25

country.

That is a contingent right.

That is not a

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

right which is non-contingent, because it must be the

2

same right as is available to nationals at home.

3

very clear that the employer — that the employment

4

rights in this Treaty are national rights, are national

5

treatment rights, and not rights that go above the

6

concept of national treatment.

It is

I would like therefore to suggest that at the

7

8

point in time that this Treaty was passed, it was

9

perfectly appropriate for Congress to pass Title VII and

10

not have that statute be in conflict with this

11

particular Treaty.

12

that the parties could have contemplated the passage of

13

Title VII, because of the U.N. charter provisions which

14

are in our brief and concepts of equality which were

15

developing at that point in time.

More than that, it is very clear

Secondly, I point out that Title VII has

16
17

specific exemptions.

18

have a section in my brief about that, that it could

19

exempt certain areas from Title VII protection, and in

20

fact did so, and did so in two areas relating to foreign

21

policy, and those sections are also set forth in my

22

brief.

23

Congress well understood, and I

I would like to make a comment about the

24

government.

25

wonders whether or not Article VIII constitutes a

2

that that is entirely an unnecessary approach to take,

3

precisely because the business necessity concept under

Title VII would give Sumitomo all the protection that it

needs there, and you must remember when you are talking

about top jobs, business necessity becomes a very potent

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF CF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

5

MR. WALLACE*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6

please the Court, in the view of the United States, the

7

dispositive issue before this Court at the present stage

8

of the case is whether the special employment privilege

9

of Article VIII is conferred on a subsidiary

10
11

incorporated in the host country, such as the Petitioner.
The answer given by the Treaty's text is that

12

that privilege is not conferred on such a subsidiary,

13

and the contracting parties to the Treaty are in

14

agreement that the textual answer is the correct one,

15

that the Treaty means what it says in this regard.

16

Now, the Court has noted that the views of the

17

contracting parties to a treaty are entitled to great

18

weight, and I think that principle applies particularly

19

when we are talking about the interpretation of a

20

provision that is obviously meant to impose reciprocal

21

obligations because it is only by a decision agreeing

22

with the views of the contracting parties that the

23

actual application of the reciprocal obligation can be

24

assured, and otherwise, there is some question

25

introduced that will cause questions to be resolved in

3

determined not to be the correct views.

QUESTION:

4

Now, the view of the Japanese

5

government is consistent with the view you have taken.

6

Is that correct?
MR. WALLACE:

7

That is correct.

One thing that

8

we have set forth with great clarity is that both

9

governments, and the Japanese government has

10

consistently taken this position, agree on the meaning

11

of Article VIII of the Treaty with respect to

12

subsidiaries incorporated in the host country, and this

view comports completely with the plain text of the

QUESTION»

1

In your view, should we stop there.

2

Nr. Wallace, or should we go on and resolve the question

3

raised about the difficulty of interpreting who is

4

covered by the Treaty trader?
NR. WALLACEs

5

Well, I don't really think there

6

is a difficulty.

Perhaps I should turn to that

7

immediately.

8

about Article VIII itself, gives an example of the usage

9

of these terms in a way, in the second sentence of

I was just going to further elucidate

10

Article VIII, it is obviously designed to draw a

11

distinction between the subsidiary incorporated in the

12

host country which would not be allowed to have

13

accountants and others practicing for it who could not

14

qualify under local law, whereas the parent in the

15

foreign country would be allowed to send in such a

16

person.

17

And right there, in Article VIII itself, the

18

distinction is drawn for a very plausible reason, and

19

there is no reason to think that the first sentence of

20

Article VIII means anything different, and let me try to

21

clarify what has been said about our discussion of

22

Treaty trader visas, because I think considerable

23

confusion has been introduced by the Petitioner's

24

contention that the securing of a Treaty trader visa in

25

any way illuminates the rights of the employing company.

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

>

All we meant on Page 6 of our brief, in the

1
2

sentence that was quoted, if one hypothesizes that as we

3

contend, Title VII applies to the subsidiary and to its

4

hiring decisions, nonetheless, the Treaty, through

5

Article I and through Article VII, gives the subsidiary

6

rights with respect to its operations here, and it can

7

consider Japanese nationals in filling its positions,

8

and it can do that consistently with Title VII either on

9

a non-discriminatory basis by deciding that the Japanese

10

national is the better qualified person for a particular

11

position, or by showing as a matter of business

12

necessity that others need not be considered for that

13

position.

QUESTION*

14
15

Would that be quite independently

of the Treaty?
MR. WALLACE*

16

It is independent of the

17

Treaty.

18

needed from the Treaty is the way to get that person

19

into the country to be employed, and that is what is

20

conferred by Article I of the Treaty and by the

21

Immigration and Naturalization law that allows these

22

people to some in under Treaty trader visas.

23

It is a right under Title VII, but what is

The heart of the

Treaty, as it has been defined.

But this has no

implications for whether Title VII applies or not.

So, it would have nothing to do with his right

to enter the United States to take the job, and we were

6

talking about something quite separate on Page 21 when

7

we talked about the possibility that the parent company

8

may claim a right to assign certain persons to the

9

subsidiary.

10

It is premature in this case to know

whether that question is presented at all.

11

On the face of things, all of these people are

12

employees of the subsidiary, and there has been no proof

13

made that any of them were assigned to the subsidiary by

14

the parent company, nor do we know yet the circumstances

15

under which that assignment was made, whether it really

16

could be argued to have been made in exercise of the

17

parent company's treaty right to manage and control the

18

subsidiary, or whether it might have been, for example,

19

just part of a training program for the parent company’s

20

personnel, to give them some experience here and there,

21

so that they will be better employees in the parent

22

company in future years, which would raise a different

23

question of whether there is a right under the Treaty to

24

assign persons for that kind of reason.

25
