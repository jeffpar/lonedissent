ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H. GOTTESMAN, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR.

8

GOTTESMANi

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court, this case, like the last one,
10 involves the question

11

whether a seniority system is

protected by Section 703(h), but the issues that are before

12 this

Court are entirely different.

13 system.

This is a pre-Act

No one disputes that it is a seniority system.

And

14 indeed, no one disputes that the ultimate outcome of this
15 case turns on the resolution of a single dispositive
16 question of fact,

that is,

whether this system was

17 negotiated or maintained with a discriminatory purpose.
18

The issues that are before this Court relate not to

19 the meaning of 703(h) as such.

That is something which is

20 common ground in both lower courts and
21

with all the parties

in amici, but rather, with the -- the respective roles of

22 district courts and courts of appeals in making

the factual

23 determination of discriminatory purpose, and with a
24 methodology that the Fifth Circuit has sought to impose,
25 both on the district courts and on itself, for treating with
3

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the evidence that bears on the resolution of that factual

2 question.

3

Now, this case was before the district court in

4 successive trials that amounted to 19 days, in which his
5 focus throughout was principally on the seniority system,
6 and

he had in addition to 19 days of testimony, a mass,

7 literally a mass of documentary evidence, and on the basis
8 of

that the district court found as fact that the seniority

9 system in this case, a system which provided that
10 departmental seniority

11

would be the measure of seniority for

layoffs, recalls, and promotions, had not been adopted with

12 a discriminatory purpose,

and had not been maintained with a

13 discriminatory purpose, and he cited a number of subsidiary
14 findings, if you will, that led him to that ultimate
15 conclusion.
16

First, this system was neutral on its face, made no

17 distinction on the basis of race, and was in fact applied
18 equally to blacks and whites throughout its existence.
19 Second, he found the system was essentially the product of
20 the union's aims and
21 company's.

policies at that plant, not the

He found that at each stage in its development

22 it was the union that

was making the demands for particular

23 seniority features, and

that the features that emanated from

24 bargaining were those that the union had sought.
25

He therefore thought it particularly important to

4

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

look at the attitudes of that union on questions of race and

2

the roles that blacks and whites respectively played within

3 that union in determining its policy.

He found that this

4 was a union rather unique in Alabama in the early 1940s that
5 pursued colorblind objections -- objectives, excuse me.
6

He

found that the work force at this particular plant was

7 roughly half black at all times, that blacks had been a
8

major force, indeed the major force in organizing the union,

9 that blacks had at all times been actively involved in the
10

leadership of the union, holding officer positions, holding

11

a majority of the shop steward positions, that blacks at all

12

times had been on the union’s negotiating committee, had

13 participated in negotiating the very seniority system in
14 question, indeed, had proposed many of the very elements of
15 the system that were under question in the negotiation, that
16 each element of the system when negotiated was brought back
17 to the membership for approval at membership meetings in
18 which blacks and whites participated equally, both in
19 speaking about the system and in voting on it, that the
20

votes on the seniority system had never divided along racial

21

lines, and he made two ultimate conclusions about the role

22

of this union that had negotiated this system.

23

One, this was not a local dominated by whites in

24 any sense -25

QUESTION;

Well, how come it was divided into two
5

separate units on racial lines?

2
3

MR. GOTTESMAN:

By two units, do you mean the plant

was divided into two bargaining units?

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. GOTTESMAN;

Yes.
Is that Your Honor’s question?

6 union was not divided into two units.
7

Union was one union.

The

The Steelworkers

8 entire plant.
9

QUESTION;

Was the plant divided into two sections?

MR. GOTTESMAN;

10

What happened was, another rival

union -- this was the CIO, the Steelworkers union.

12

came and said, we are an industrial union, we want to

13

organize the entire plant.

14

QUESTION;

15

That wasn’t my question.

MR. GOTTESMAN;

17

QUESTION;

19

Were there two

separate units, one white and one black, in this plant?

16

18

They

No.

Well, were blacks and whites in the same

jobs?
MR. GOTTESMAN;

They were in the same departments,

20 They were historically not in the same jobs.
21

QUESTION;

My point was, were they in the same jobs?

22

MR. GOTTESMAN;

No, the company assigned blacks to

23

some jobs and whites to others, and it was this seniority

24

system that --

25

QUESTION;

And the union permitted it?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

No, the union did not

2 permit it.

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. GOTTESMAN;

Well, did the union represent it?
The union negotiated a seniority

5 system that enabled blacks to exercise seniority to get to
6 the white jobs.

QUESTION;

And the union allowed them to have

MR. GOTTESMAN;

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. GOTTESMAN;

Well, did they stop it?
Pardon me?

Did they stop it?
They stopped it before the

15 effective date of Title 7, and they stopped it with this
16 very seniority system.
17

QUESTION;

Those were the findings.

Yes, and it is still based on the same

18 thing .
19

MR. GOTTESMAN;

20

QUESTION;

21
22

I am sorry?

I still don't understand how the union

agreed to this all along.
MR. GOTTESMAN;

Well, Your Honor,

the union walked

23 into a plant in which the company had discriminatorily
24 assigned people to jobs on the basis of race.

It had not by

25 virtue of that put all blacks in this department and all

1 blacks in that department.

Departments were set up for

2 operational purposes, long before there was a union, long
3 before there was a seniority —
4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GOTTESMANi

6 Honor.

And just accidentally -It wasn’t accidental at all. Your

The company for racial motivations found by the

7 district court discriminatorily assigned people to jobs.
8 When the union came on the scene, there was a department.
9 That department had jobs with black people on them and it
10 had jobs with white people on them, and the union said, we
11 want a departmental seniority system, and that system, when
12 they got it and when they finally got promotion rights under
13 it, meant that blacks on a job where the company had put
14 them because they were black could now exercise their
15 seniority to promote to the jobs that had previously been
16 assigned to the whites.
17

QUESTION:

But they started off on an unequal

18 footing.
19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Absolutely.

Started off, because

20 the company assigned them different jobs.
21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GOTTESMAN:

23 footing, Your Honor.

They ended up on an unequal footing.
No, they ended up on an equal

That is the important thing, because

24 since departmental seniority was the measure, the time that
25 a black had spent on that black job that the company

assigned him to counted just as much as the time that a

2

white spent on a white job.

QUESTION;

So if I started off in the plant solely

4 because of race the same day you did, and I started eight
5 steps below you on the seniority level, solely because of my

very important fact here.

10

No

QUESTION;

I’ll bet you you don’t know what my

hypothetical is.
MR. GOTTESMAN;

11

12 Honor.

I am sorry.

Excuse me, Your

You are entirely --

13

(General laughter.)

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. GOTTESMAN:

16

QUESTION:

I'll bet you you don’t.
Okay.

And I start off eight steps behind you,

17 solely because of my race, and

I am told

I can't advance,

18 and then 85 years later they tell me I can advance to the
19 same extent that you advance, you say I am not discriminated
20 against?
21

MR. GOTTESMAN:

There is no question you were

22 discriminated against before the passage of Title 7.

23

QUESTION;

Well, what difference is it except the

24 85 years?
25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Your Honor, there is no doubt that

9

1

but for the Section 703(h) and the decision in Teamsters,

2 there is an

injury suffered by people by reason of pre-Act

3 discrimination.

It happens to be much less here than in

4 most cases, because here the hypothetical Your Honor gave,
5 that you were eight steps below, doesn’t exist.
6 were no

lines of progression.

Here there

That was one of the very

7 important things the district court pointed out as evidence
8 of innocent motivation.

9

Here, everyone was told, promotions from now on

10

within this department will be on the basis of departmental

11

seniority, without any lines of progression, so that a black

12 who had

been in that plant longer, even though he had been

13 assigned to the bottom job, or the lowest paying job -14 there was no bottom job as such in the department -- would
15 be free to use that seniority to claim any job in that
16 department that he wished the minute a vacancy arose.
17

In other words, this -- the design of this system

18 was found by the district court to be positive evidence of
19 innocent motivation, because although many people for
20 non-discriminatory reasons,

in all-white plants, for

21 example, where race couldn't be a factor, do in fact develop
22 lines of progression.

There is nothing inherently vicious

23 about lines of progression.
24 contain those.

In fact, this system didn't

This system contained a much quicker route

9 the

parties' choice of that measure of seniority was badly

10 motivated.

And the court said, I have nothing to support such

11

12 an inference.
13

On the contrary, every plant in America of

this size and with this disparity of jobs is either a

The only

of seniority system you can create that doesn’t have

in assignments, is one that says, from now on,

18 whenever

it will go to the most senior person in the plant who

20 bids for it.

5

You wouldn’t know from day to day where you were

So that there was no such thing as the only kind of

6

seniority system that would not have disparate impact, and

7

what that meant was, and this was the point the district

8

court found absolutely most important in his analysis, what

9

that meant was, when a union organized a plant, a large

10

plant where the employer had historically discriminated, and

11

that discrimination was still manifested in the placement of

12

people in the plant, it was not conceivable that innocently

13

motivated parties would have negotiated a system that would

14

not have dispa rate impact.

15

To choose to have a seniority system meant that you

16

were going to have a system that had disparate impact.

Now,

17

I suppose one could say, well, the fact that these parties

18

chose to have a seniority system of any kind is evidence of

19

bad motives.

20

wouldn't have chosen to have a seniority system.

And it is not possible in the face of a history of

assignments to negotiate however innocently a

seniority system that doesn't have a disparate impact.

Now,

it happens that among the choices that

The widest kind of seniority anybody ever

adopted anywhere was departmental seniority without lines of

Now, that,

I think, indicates what is the danger of

placing undue emphasis on evidence of disparate impact in

22 measuring seniority systems, and this would be true of a

Simply to choose to

have a seniority system is to create something that will

2

have disparate impact.

3

QUESTIONf

Hr. Gottesman, what test did the

4

district court employ for determining the intent in setting

5

up the system?

6

MB. GOTTESMAN;

When you say what test, he said the

7

question before me is, were the parties motivated by a

8

racial purpose.

9

from Teamsters, and foreseeability, Teamsters eliminated as

That was his test.

He derived that test

10

an element in the inquiry foreseeability.

11

true if a union comes on a plant that has had disparate

12

assignments, to choose to have a seniority system will

13

foreseeably have a disparate impact, but what Teamsters said

14

is, that the is the very thing Congress wanted to protect in

15

703(h).

16

system would have those effects, and it wanted to say,

17

because it wanted to protect seniority systems, that

18

notwithstanding that it was inevitable that those systems

19

would have that effect, we want to protect those systems,

20

and we will not invalidate them, as this Court also said in

21

Feeney, in the Fourteenth Amendment context, and it said it

22

again in Teamsters in the Title 7 context, we will only

23

allow the invalidation of those systems that were set up

24

because of, not in spite of their disparate impact.

25

Now, it is always

It knew that it was foreseeable that any seniority

So that if you find that these parties designed the
14

system for the purpose of hurting blacks, or fencing them

2

out, or whatever, that system will not be protected, but if

3 these parties with

innocent purpose set up the same

or everybody were black,

up if everybody were

that is to say, a system

6 which was not shaped by racial purpose, then the mere fact
7 that that system has a continuing effect because of the
8 company's independent discrimination will not invalidate
9 that system.

the efforts to reject it led by the minority employees,

they proceed to recite their own

standard, which is, while we are bound by findings of fact

10

under the clearly erroneous rule, if there are subsidiary

non-discrimination, that is a finding of ultimate fact in

Court has said that where all the evidence is undisputed

2

the inference to be drawn when it is the dispositive fact is

3 to be drawn by the district court and is to be reviewed
4 under Pule 52(a).

There is not to be de novo review.

This

5 Court has repeatedly said that, and we have cited those
6

cases in our brief.

7

So that I won't go through — we have done it in

8

our brief -- the reasons why this limited scope of review

9 has been provided, but there is no question, this Court has
10

definitively decided enumerable times that the standard of

11

review the Fifth Circuit is now applying is wrong.
Now, the other issue that comes here is that the

12

13 Fifth Circuit, after having assumed this responsibility of
14 independent factfinder, proceeded to apply the so-called
15 James factors as its methodology for resolving that fact.
16 Now, the James factors carry with them two kinds of
17 problems.

The first problem is, they list four factors that

18 are relevant, and Number Four happens to be whether the
19 system has a -- was negotiated or maintained with a
20

discriminatory purpose.

Well, since we know that that is

21

the only question under Teamsters, the fact that there are

22

three up there before it has an intrinsic potential for

23 creating three additional tests that a seniority system must
24 meet, and indeed, that is the way it effectively works in
25 the Fifth Circuit.
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Our position is that there ought not to be any

2 elevation of particular items of evidence as the most
3 important items to
4

find discriminatory purpose.

As this

Fifth Circuit is doing.

It would be wrong to do that even if the three

11

12 touchstones

they cited were particularly probative, but in

13 fact they are not.
14 already

The first is impact, and as I have

talked, and I won't go through that again, impact is

15 a very unreliable indicator of the

motive of a seniority

16 system,

where the company has historically discriminated,

17 because

if the parties chose any system at all, it was going

18 to have bad

impact, and that doesn’t mean the parties were

19 badly motivated.

The degree of impact is going to be a

20 product of how badly the employer discriminated
21

in

assignments, not how meanly the parties designed their

22 seniority system.
23
24 rather,

We have talked in our brief, in our reply brief,
about the other two, and shown why they likewise are

25 not reliable indicators.

So there ought not to be a

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

hierarchy of evidentiary points at all, but if there were

2 one,

it should certainly not include the three that the

3 Fifth Circuit has made dispositive.
4

And what they did here, they reversed the district

8 wasn't to be looked

at.

They had their three little

9 touchstones, impact, the employer was engaging in other
10 discrimination at that time,
11

and there were some differences

between this system and the system at the company's northern

12 plant,

all of which

the district court explained, it seems

13 to us, quite convincingly.
14

So, we suggest that for both of these reasons, the

15 Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed, and

I would

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MISS JONES:

Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court, some 15 years ago, less than two years

22 after the passage and

the effective date of Title 7, black

23 employees at the Pullman-Standard Company filed charges of
24 discrimination with the EEOC, seeking their rightful place
25 in the employment picture of the company.

25 but one is, the court also determined that NLRB

i

3 we have is a Machinist, an all-white Machinist bargaining
4 unit which excluded blacks by reason of race, with its
5 seniority system, and it was able to get the all-black
6 bargaining unit through entering into an agreement with the
7 Machinists, and the IAM system has two departments, the
8 Machinists, the IAN system, the Machinist system, has two
9 departments; the Steelworkers system has 26 departments.
10 The two IAM departments are all white departments culled
11 from departments which were in -- which were previously
12 racially mixed departments before unionization.
13

The court of appeals was absolutely correct in its

14 conclusion that the seniority system was not bona fide.
15 Now, it is important to review for purposes of our argument
16 the context in which the court of appeals reached its
17 con elusion.
18

All right.

Arlington Heights tells us to look at

19 the historical background in which a decision was made.

The

20 company negotiated seniority rules at Pullman-Standard.

It

21 was the only actor who negotiated every seniority rule in
22 this litigation.

From the time it opened its doors to do

23 business in Bessemer, Alabama, in 1929, it racially
24 stratified the plant.

There were black jobs, white jobs.

25 It had some all-white departments, some all-black

15 This case was remanded in light of Teamsters, and it was a

The only

17 witnesses at the hearing were two witnesses called by

19 seniority documentation in this case and the record is all
20 documents, and anything that was referred to in an earlier

There is no testimony that goes

22 to the question of bona fides.
23

Also, I invite the Court to look at the memorandum

25 he granted a hearing in light of Teamsters on bona fides,

30

that leads to the virtually inescapable inference of intent

regarding the IAM’s exclusion of blacks from its bargaining

unit, how at the representational hearing in 1941-42, how it

8

maneuvered jobs based on race and not job function, how it

9

hop-skipped over jobs based on the race of the job

10

incumbent, how the IAN selected a patchwork guilt of

11

production and craft jobs, and excluded any blacks that were

12

in production jobs but included whites that were in related

production jobs.

Now, the Machinists also represented both craft and

production jobs until the close of the plant.

17

was not completely successful because the Machinists

bargaining unit was certified and included some blacks.

When NLRB certified the union it included some blacks.

20

the Machinist was able to rid itself of all of the blacks in

21

its bargaining unit when it entered into an agreement with

Then, during the

the company and the

12

The

13 company maintained the segregative purpose of the seniority
14 system, not only in dye and tool, but in every racially
15 disproportionate department at the company.
Now, the discriminatory departmental assignments in

16

17 this case, which is the law of the case before, during, and

19 very strong evidence of an intent to discriminate entering

QUESTION:

When a reviewing court finds that the

3 initial tryer has applied erroneous rules of law to guide
4 the factfinding process, is the correct solution for the
5 reviewing court to make its own findings, or to send it back
6 for making findings under the corrected rule of law?

MISS JONES;

Well, in this case, Chief Justice

8 Burger, the record is documentary.
9 to the facts.

There is no dispute as

The argument is over the inferences to be

10 drawn from those facts.

The Fifth Circuit -- this was the

11 second time the Fifth Circuit had reviewed this case, and it
12 remanded it the first time.

This time, when it saw the

13 legal errors of the court of appeals, it was in the same
14 posture to make the inferences as the court of appeals -- as
15 the district court.

The district court had failed to look

16 at huge chunks of its evidence, because of its erroneous
17 application of legal principles.

It had ruled out the NLRB

18 -- decided that the NLRB, what had happened was irrelevant.
19 It had decided that the motives of one of the architects of
20 the seniority system was irrelevant.

The court of appeals

21 had told it before to look at the IAM departments.
22

And so, in this instance, the rationale behind Rule

23 52, which is demeanor of witnesses and credibility findings
24 of trial courts, it didn't apply, but --

11

And those were the three errors you

12 described earlier.

13

MISS JONES;

And because of those errors, the

14 district court’s view of the evidence completely changed,
15 would change in terms of motive.

The impact of the IAM on

16 the Steelworkers unit, the division of the departments, the
17 manipulation between the unions, that evidence was simply -18 the district court just didn't look at that, and had not
19 looked at it, and so therefore any of the findings that it
20 did
21

make, the court of appeals respected the subsidiary

findings and applied the clearly erroneous rule to that,

22 because

it uses the language in the opinion, and I assume

23 when it looked at the facts of the district court, the
24 subsidiary facts,
25

those that could stand, stood.

But the guestion as to whether intent, you know, is

There are no disputed facts in this case.

The

16 argument is the inference to be drawn from those facts, and
17 in these cases,

there should not be a hard and fast rule

18 that the court must decide the case or that it must send the

The official administration of justice in these
