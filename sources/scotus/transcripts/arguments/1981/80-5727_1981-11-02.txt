Twenty years of age.

Because of the treatment of the case by the

1 brief, one special point should

be made.

We are not here

2 talking about accountability or criminal responsibility.

I

3 concede to the state their right to fix the age of criminal
4 responsibility.

The state in essence asked for that

5 latitude which they receive under the due process clause
6 under the Eighth

Amendment.

It is our position this is a

7 very narrow issue, the imposition of the death penalty upon
8 a 16-year-old child.

Whatever age the state wishes to fix

9 for relinquishing children to the adult court system, I
10 grant

their power.

11

There is in my argument one assumption.

That

12 assumption is that there is an age somewhere below which it

13 is cruel and unusual punishment to put a child

to death.

14 The question is, what is that age?
15

In Gregg, this Court stated that death is a

16 punishment unique in its severity and irrevocability,
17 different in kind from any other punishment imposed, and
18 indeed it is.

In subsequent cases such as Lockett and

19 Woodson, the Court stated it is necessary to focus upon the
20 particular character of the defendant to determine if

the

21 punishment is proportionate to the offense and to the
22 person.

This Court has on innumerable occasions

23 acknowledged youth as a most mitigating circumstance.

In

24 fact, in every instance in which the Court has made
25 reference to mitigating factors or given examples of them.

MR. BAKER;

That would certainly be one solution.

Lockett would mandate a remand.

If we were to do that, then I guess we

would not reach the issue of the age limit problem for an

MR. BAKER;

MR. BAKER:

I don't see how they could think such,

They gave such a broad standard there that --

QUESTION:

Well, do you think simply pulling over

6 and shooting a highway patrolman who thinks he is stopping

11 atrocious.

Going back to Godfrey, the crime was a

Any murder involves an element of being cruel.

12 The crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed are

Studies in fact suggest that at about the point

15 or 16 — I am referring to studies by Renn, Colberg,

21 and Turrell which are mentioned in our brief -- there is a
22 regression during the years of stormy adolescence.

When the

23 kids start to develop into adolescence, are subjected to
24 these pressures, they actually regress in terms of making
25 judgmental decisions.

Further, any such testing like that would subject

2 the cultural minorities to the death penalty because the
3 tests are biased against them.
4

My position is that we grant them measureable

5 exposure to living, to the life experience before we hold
6 them accountable as adults.

I suggest the age of 18 because

7 that is the age accepted universally, and it has
8 constitutional significance, too.
9

QUESTION*

Don't some 20 odd states not require

10 the age of 18, but say, youth may be considered as a
11 mitigating circumstance below that age, but is not an
12 absolute bar ?
13

MR. BAKER*

There ae 24 states, I believe, that

14 provide that youth is to be considered as a mitigating
15 circumstance.

Six states state boldly, we will not execute

16 anyone under the age of 18.
17

QUESTION:

Well, under the test of the evolving

18 social mores that this Court has stated on times for cruel,
19 unusual punishment, if you've got six lined up against 24,
20 you can't really say that you have a majority on your side,
21 can you?
22

MR. BAKER*

It is my suggestion, Your Honor, that

23 we judge these evolving standards by not the availability of
24 capital punishment but by its use.

In our history, and

25 things today show without question that this country just

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

It has been 1948 since a

2 16-year-old was executed.

MR. BAKER*

I would be making the same argument

16-year-old.
QUESTION*

What is the difference about this

5 alcoholic mother and all?
6

MR. BAKER*

It is my suggestion that there are

7 mitigating circumstances, that there are other circumstances
8 besides youth that mitigate the imposition of capital
9 punishment in this case.
10

QUESTION*

I thought your position was that under

11 no circumstances ever did a person who comitted a murder at
12 the age of 16 when the act was committed could suffer the
13 capital punishment.

I thought that is the narrow issue that

14 we had.
15

MR. BAKER*

That is Proposition One.

16 narrow issue, Your Honor.

That is the

I just superimpose upon that the

17 particular circumstances of this particular defendant.
18

QUESTION*

Well, you do have a second question in

19 your brief that whether or not you prevail on your
20 16-year-old argument, that the case should be remanded.
21

MR. BAKER*

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. BAKER;

Yes.
Because of what you call a plain error.
Because of the Lockett violation, and

24 because of the other mitigating circumstances.

Otherwise,

QUESTION:

Do you have a case where we have ever

2 recognized what you call a plain error coming from a state
3 court that wasn't raised or litigated below?
4

MR. BAKER:

There is one cited in the brief.

I

5 don't have it off the top of my head.
6

QUESTION:

Do you think then that the Court should

7 under Lockett, although the trial judge allowed all of this
3 testimony to come in, nonetheless, re-evaluate for itself
9 whether or not the mitigating circumstances outweighed the
10 aggravating circum stances?
11

MR. BAKER:

I would welcome the Court doing that.

12 There are two ways you can read Godfrey.

One way would

13 indicate that is what the Court did in Godfrey.
14 the way I read it.

That is not

I read Godfrey as just saying the lower

15 court gave too broad an interpretation to the death penalty.
16

QUESTION:

Well, certainly Proffitt and Gregg and

17 Jurek simply said if the states set up these systems which
18 were subject to the safeguards that were incorporated in
19 them, they were entitled to impose capital punishment.
20

MR. BAKER;

21 construed, yes.

If the statutes are properly

There are, I suggest, many reasons why 18

22 should be the point below which we don't impose capital

23 punishment.

The Twenty-Sixth Amendment of our Constitution.

24 The American Law Institute in their model penal code has a
25 provision that absolutely forbids execution of any juvenile

1 under the age of 18
2

All European countries vhich still retain capital

3 punishment have an absolute prohibition against the
4 execution of anyone under the age of 18.

President Carter

5 has signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political
6 Rights, which prohibits the execution of defendants under
7 the age of 18.
8

QUESTIONS

Mr. Baker, are you talking now about

9 execution at the time of execution or time of the offense?
10

MR. BAKERs

11

The American Convention on Human Rights, also

12 signed by President Carter, has an absolute prohibition
13 against the execution of juveniles.

I mention it only to show that the current

21 thought in Europe and apparently in South America is that
22 execution of juveniles is barbaric.

There is no longer a

24 of the eastern European countries that have capital
25 punishment, they all forbid the execution of persons under

QUESTION;

Perhaps they don’t have a Constitution

3 like ours that affirmatively authorizes the death penalty,
4 but places no limit on it.
5

MR. BAKER;

No country has a Constitution like

6 ours.

whether the Court should address the plain

12 error
13

MR.

BAKER;

14

QUESTION;

Yes.
-- I don't find it in your petition for

15 certiorari.
16

MR. BAKER;

I believe it is there.

It has been a

17 long time since I read the petition for cert.
18

QUESTION;

19

MR. BAKER;

I know it is in the brief.
I think we should make a distinction,

20 too, between a certified juvenile and an adult.

The mere

21 fact that Monty Eddings or any other child is certified for
22 trial in the adult court system does not make him an adult.
23 He is still a child.

I see us as we are striving in our

24 development, where we will reach a point some day where I
25 don’t believe that capital punishment will be tolerated at

Probably not in my lifetime, but as we march in this

2 progress, as we strive to become better, I urge that we not
3 regress to the point where we execute children.
4

QUESTION;

Well, would you consider the so-called

5 march that you have referred to from Furman to Proffitt and
6 Jurek and Gregg as a march in the direction that you are
7 talking about?

Quite honestly, Your Honor, I believe

12

MR. BAKER*

You have a lot of company.
I would just like to make one

13 statement, and that is, the only purpose I can see in

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
2

3

Mr. Lee?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. LEE , ESQ.,

4
5

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

6 Court, the facts of this case reveal that the Petitioner in
7 this case, Monty Eddings, was 16 years old at the time he
8 intentionally murdered an Oklahoma highway patrol trooper, a
9 man by the name of Larry Crabtree, with a sawed-off shotgun
10 as the trooper approached the vehicle which Mr. Eddings had
11 been driving.

The murder occurred after Mr. Eddings

12 announced to the other members of the car that he would blow
13 the trooper away if he hassled him, then loaded the
14 sawed-off shotgun, waited as the trooper approached, and
15 fired the shotgun, striking him in the heart from a distance
16 of approximately six or seven feet.
17

The issues in this case are. Number One, whether

18 the United States Constitution prohibits a state from
19 imposing a penalty of death in every case involving a person
20 who was under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of
21 the crime without a consideration of the circumstances of
22 the offense and without a consideration of the character and
23 record of the individual defendant.
24

The Petitioners also raise the question whether or

25 not the punishment imposed in this case, the penalty of

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 death, by a person who was 16 years old at the time of the
2 commission of the crime for the crime of the intentional
3 murder of a law enforcement officer is disproportionate, in
4 violation of the Constitution.
5

The state contends that the adoption of a

6 chronological age as the sole determinative factor in making
7 the decision as to whether to impose the penalty of death to
8 the exclusion of all other considerations has support
9 neither in reason nor in the previous decisions of this
10 Court.
11

We submit that under the facts and circumstances

12 of this individual case, that Oklahoma’s decision to impose
13 the death penalty upon the Petitioner who intentionally
14 murdered one of our law enforcement officers does not
15 violate the Eighth Amendment.
16

QUESTION:

General Lee, before you get into your

17 argument too far, I would like to ask you about the very
18 first premise that your opponent suggested, and I don’t know
19 whether it is right or not, but he said something to the
20 effect that everybody would agree that there is some minimum
21 age that you can’t go below.
22 age?

The question is, what is that

In other words, would you deny that there is any

23 minimum age?

Should you execute, say, a ten-year-old or a

24 nine-year-old?
25

MR. LEE;

Well, first, of course, our contention

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is that should be

2 age limi t,
3
4

if there is going to be a chronological

it should be a legislative decision.
QUESTION;

I mean, is there any consti tutiona1

barrier, is what the question is.

5

MR. LEE;

I feel like that this Court should never

6 have to answer that question.
7

This Court, in Ba rker versus

WingO/ w as asked to set the six-month period of time within

8 which a defendant had to receive a speedy trial.
9

It

declined to do so, stating that its approach in setting

10

fixed li nes like that must not be -- cannot be r igid .

11

Instead, it set forth four factors which must be

12

con sider ed.

13

has used in the Woodson case and --

14

I feel like that is the approach th at the Court

QUESTION;

Well, let's hope we never h ave to

15

answer t he question as to a nine or a ten-year-o Id, but I

16

guess in England there were times when very, ver y young

17

people w ere executed.

18

con stitu tional limit on the age of a person that could be

19

executed ?

20

MR. LEE;

21

QUESTION;

Would you say there is an y

I don't know what that age would be.
I am not asking you what the age is.

22 am askin g you if you think

there is any constitutional

Specifically, say, would it be constitutional for a

23

limit,

24

state to execute a ten-year-old for committing this crime?

25

MR. LEE;

If the individual was ten years old, I

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 would assume that the objective factors would not support
2 the imposition of the death penalty.
3

QUESTION;

Kell, that is not my question.

If you

4 don't want to answer it, of course, I can’t force you to,
5 but do you have a view on a proper answer to my question?
6

MR. LEE;

Okay.

Yes, Your Honor.

I think it

7 would be cruel and unusual punishment to impose the death
8 penalty on an individual who was ten years old.
9

QUESTION;

And if that was the only mitigating

10 circumstance in the case?
11

MR. LEE;

I think that looking at that by itself

12 would be enough to convince anybody, including this Court,
13 that a ten-year-old person under no circumstances should
14 receive the death penalty.

Like I say,

I don’t think the

15 objective factors which the Court used in striking down
16 Georgia’s death penalty, when it noted that Georgia was the
17 only state in the union that imposed the penalty of death
18 for the crime of rape -- I think that in that case it could
19 look toward the 50 states and see that a very small minority
20 of states would impose a penalty of death.
21

Also, I don’t anticipate that Oklahoma will ever

22 be in that position.

I am glad of the fact that we only

23 have one individual on our death row that is in this
24 position , and I would hate to be in the position of arguing,
25 look, we’ve got a number of juveniles on death row, that

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 shows that it is not cruel and unusual punishment to do so.
2 I think we have been -- the cases cited by the Petitioner
3 have shown that we have been very careful in making that
4 decision, and have not abused our discretion.
5

However, the facts in this case support our

6 decision to impose the death penalty, considering the victim
7 and the character and record of this individual defendant.
8

We urge the Court to uphold the punishment of

9 death in this case.

We ask the Court to recognize that we

10 have covered and followed our own certification procedures
11 very carefully in this case.

We have found that under our

12 statute on certification, the test being if the individual
13 is able to make a distinction between right and wrong and is
14 to be held accountable for his acts in accordance with eight
15 specific guidelines.
16

QUESTION:

We think the evidence supports -General, what about the ten-year-old

17 that knows the difference between right and wrong?
18

MR. LEE:

Well, there are a number of other

19 guidelines that the sentencer would have to take into
20 consideration.

There are eight specific guidelines, and

21 sophistication and maturity are one of those guidelines.
22

QUESTION:

23 off on that road.
24

MR. LEE:

I just didn't want you to get too far
You might find trouble.
Well, certification statutes in general

25 are an admission by the state that there is a certain time

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in life when we don't know whether an individual should be
2 held accountable for his actions.

As this Court noted in

3 Breed versus Jones, an overwhelming number of jurisdictions
4 in this country have certification procedures.
5 federal government.
6 are not

So does the

And we think that if we admit that we

able to make that decision on every 16-year-old

7 person, as long as we followed our statute in that regard in
8 this case,

which we think we have, as long as the sentencer

9 has found one or more aggravating circumstances, pursuant to
10 our death penalty
11 discretion,

statute, in order to guide him in his

as long as he has taken age to be a mitigating

12 circumstance,

as he did in this case, we feel like the death

13 penalty should be upheld.
14

In the case of Bell versus Ohio, this Court

15 reversed a conviction of a person who was 16 years old at
16 the time of the commission of the murder.

It said that the

17 Ohio statute was incorrect because it prohibited the
18 sentencer from taking into consideration such things such as
19 the age of the defendant, but this Court in that decision
20 did

not in any way suggest or imply that the age of the

21 offender,

Mr. Bell in that case, would be considered to be

22 anything more than

23

one of several mitigating circumstances.

We ask that this Court's decision in that case and

24 in Lockett, and Woodson not be extended to completely bar
25 the execution of persons who were 16 years old at the time

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the commission of the crime without a consideration of
2 their background, character, and the circumstances
3 surrounding the individual offense.
4

We believe that the adoption by this Court of a

5 chronological age below which the state could never go in
6 imposing the penalty of death would create an arbitrary and
1 artificial line in the determination of the death penalty.
8

As I stated earlier, by analogy, this Court,

when

9 requested to adopt a six-month guideline within which a
10 defendant in a criminal case should receive a trial under
11 the mandates of the speedy trial provision of the Sixth
12 Amendment, this Court declined to do so, setting forth
13 factors for the trial court to weigh and consider in making
14a determination whether the speedy trial provision of the
15 Sixth Amendment had been violated.
16

We feel like the determination by the state as far

17 as the accountability and responsibility of a criminal
18 defendant, if anything, is a much more complex decision.
19

Furthermore, as we have stated in our brief, we

20 contend that the legislatures in this country should be
21 allowed to respond to sociological and technological changes
22 which may occur in their society, and to recognize that
23 younger people in this country are becoming mature at an
24 ear lier age .
25

We feel like the state should be allowed to react

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to the increase in and the horror of juvenile crime, and to
2 impose the penalty of death in a proper case.
3

We think that the record in this case is

4 Oklahoma’s best record that the penalty of death should be
5 imposed.

The facts as I have stated earlier reveal a murder

6 which by all standards and definitions was an intentional
7 one.

It was undertaken with malice aforethought, which is

8 required by our statute.

We have an individual defendant

9 who at the time of the commission of the murder by all
10 accounts was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
11 He is an individual who the other occupants of the vehicle
12 attempted to persuade him not to shoot the trooper as he
13 approached the car.

This includes three people in the car

14 who were younger than the Petitioner, two 14-year-old people
15 and a 15-year-old person.

They all testified they tried to

16 stop him from killing the trooper as he approached the car.
17

He is an individual who, according to the

18 testimony of the four expert witnesses on the subject of his
19 mental status who testified, according to none of them was
20 he insane or psychotic.

All the doctors testified that he

21 knew the difference between right or wrong, that he was not
22 mentally ill.

Even in his own -- even his own expert

23 witnesses -- he had a psychologist who testified, and he
24 contended that his problem was the fact that he had an
25 antisocial behavior problem.

He was a sociopath.

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Both the psychiatrists that testified for the

2 Petitioner stated that he was not the victim of parental
3 abuse.

Dr. Gagliano, who testified -- who was the

4 psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the Petitioner
5 stated that he knew the difference between right or wrong at
6 the time he pulled the trigger, but that it did not apply to
7 him.

He said that there was something wrong with Mr.

SEddings' personality, but there was nothing wrong with his
9 mind.
10

He also testified, as did the other psychiatrist,

11 that there was no thinking disorder, no psychosis, and that
12 he knew the difference between right or wrong, as I stated.
13

Also, the testimony of his juvenile probation

14 officer from the state of Missouri, Steven Dorn, testified,
15 "Monty is sharp".

He stated he was an individual of average

16 intelligence.
17

In addition, we have an individual who expressed

18 absolutely no remorse for what he did.

This was evidenced

19 by statements he made to the other law enforcement officers
20 in jail after he was arrested.

He stated at one point, "If

21 you don’t turn out this light, I will shoot you just like I
22 -- I have already shot one of your people and I will shoot
23 you, too, unless you turn out that light."

He made the

24 statement immediately after the murder to two law
25 enforcement officers, "I have already killed one of your

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 people, I will kill you, too, if I get out."
2

QUESTION;

3

HR. LEE;

And all this was before the Court?
Yes, Your Honor.

This was -- those

4 particular statements were what the sentencer used in his
5 determination that the defendant was capable of criminal
6 acts of violence in the future.

That was one of the

7 aggravating circumstances which were found.
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Lee, the trial court -- there was

9 no jury in this case, as I understand it.

The trial court

10 held that the only mitigating factor he could consider was
11 the age cf the defendant.

He therefore did not consider in

12 determining that the sentence should be death the family
13 background of this 16-year-old, nor his extreme emotional
14 disorder, nor the other circumstances possibly relevant to
15 the commission of the crime.

Is that the general law in

16 Oklahoma ?
17

HR. LEE;

Well, Your Honor, the law in Oklahoma,

18 according to our statute, is that the sentencer is to
19 consider any mitigating circumstances which the defendant
20 might have to offer.
21

QUESTION;

So that any mitigating circumstances

22 could have been considered?
23

MR. LEE;

24

QUESTION;

Yes.
Do you think it was error not to have

25 considered those that I mentioned?

Are you saying that issue was not

brought here, even though it was considered in the court in

13 Oklahoma?

MR. LEE;

14

One of his propositions was that the

15 defendant should not receive the death penalty because of
16 his background.
17 the

That was one of the issues he raised, and

Court of Criminal Appeals said that the family

18 background of the Petitioner was useful in
19 behaved the way he did.

explaining why he

It does not excuse his behavior.

20 So I suppose indirectly they dealt with that particular
21

22

part

of it.
But in answer to your question, I think the remark

23 is ambiguous.

It could be interpreted to mean that he was

24 not going to consider the juvenile’s previous juvenile
25 record in Missouri, which was extensive, although

it was not

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 anything approaching what he did in this particular case.
2 It could mean, and I think -- my interpretation of it is
3 that the trial court did not consider the fact of his family
4 background as a mitigating circumstance.
5

He listened to evidence.

He allowed him to

6 introduce into evidence anything he wished, but the violent
7 background, which I assume he meant was -- I believe his
8 juvenile officer testified on one occasion Eddings had
9 washed the walls and his stepfather came home and slapped
10 him around a little bit, and then he was subject to some
11 slapping around and some beating by his father.

I think

12 that should be weighed with the fact that his own two expert
13 witnesses said that he was not the victim of parental abuse.
14

Now, I think that if he was the victim of parental

15 abuse to the fact that it causes some mental retardation or
16 psychosis or something like that, that might -17

QUESTION:

I have trouble with no abuse.

Slapping

18 around is not abuse?
19

MR. LEE:

I don’t think that is what we normally

20 consider to be severe child abuse.
21

QUESTION:

What do you consider slapping around to

22 be?
23

MR. LEE:

I don't -- well, for one thing, he was

24 14 years old before he went to live again with his father.
25

QUESTION:

Well, what do you consider slapping

HR. LEE:

Well, I don't consider it to be the kind

3 of severe

MR. LEE;

Just a little bit of slapping

6 degrees of slapping around, and I don't think this is the -7

QUESTION:

8 kill.
9

MR. LEE:

That's correct, and I think if there is

10 abuse which affects an individual to the point which he is
11 psychotic, mentally retarded, where it directly causes an
12 extreme emotional disturbance which this Court said may be a
13 circumstance that might accompany the killing of a police
14 officer — I think that was in Roberts versus Louisiana -15 that is —
16

QUESTION:

Does the record show these were

17 isolated incidences, or a general pattern of behavior in
18 that setting?
19

MR. LEE;

Well, the juvenile officer said that the

20 beatings were inconsistent, or the slappings around, or -- I
21 think he said slappings, beatings.
22 stated.

I believe that's what he

They were not to the extent where he stated that he

23 noted the Petitioner coming in with any marks on him.

The

24 Petitioner’s own sister said that she had never seen any
25 marks on the Petitioner.

Mr. Dorn, the probation officer,

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 said that he had never

there was nothing in his file to

2 indicate that he was a victim of parental abuse.
3

So, in defense of what the judge said, this

4 individual was a product of a middle class background.

He

5 was an individual who came from a broken home, but in order
6 to consider what happened to him to be mitigating, I think
7 probably you would have to consider the backgrounds of most
8 criminals to be mitigating, and he was just not legally
9 convinced that this provided a legal excuse for what the
10 Petitioner did.
11

Going back to the lack of the Petitioner that is

12 also reflected in the examination that was conducted at the
13 state's reguest at the state mental institution, the
14 psychiatrist there stated that the Petitioner showed no
15 remorse at any time for what he had done.
16

We contend that the only fact in this record that

17 is mitigating in the Petitioner's behalf is his age.

If he

18 was not 16 years old, this would be nothing more than a
19 cold-blooded murder of a law enforcement officer for no
20 legal justification whatsoever.
21

This Court in Roberts versus Louisiana noted that

22 there are circumstances that might attend the killing of a
23 police officer which might be considered to be mitigating.
24 The Court listed youth, the absence of any prior
25 convictions, the influence of drugs or alcohol, and I am

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 quoting here, "an extreme emotional disturbance or the
2 existence of circumstances which the offender reasonably
3 provided a moral justification for his conduct."

However,

4 here —
5

QUESTION:

Counsel, is it your position then that

6 there is no circumstance in this case that could have
7 constituted a mitigating circumstance other than the youth?
8

MR. LEE:

9

QUESTION;

That is our position.

Yes, Your Honor.

Your state appellate court or supreme

10 court said, there is no doubt that the Petitioner has a
11 personality disorder, and you would say under no
12 circumstances could that be a mitigating circumstance?
13

MR. LEE;

A personality disorder, and I believe

14 they talked about it being in terms of antisocial
15 personality or the fact he is a sociopath -16

QUESTION;

Well, it says, he stressed his family

17 history, in saying he was suffering from severe
18 psychological and emotional disorders, and that the killing
19 was in actuality an inevitable product of the way he was
20 raised, and then the Court says, there is no doubt that the
21 Petitioner has a personality disorder, then concluded that
22 that did not excuse the offense in any way, but is it your
23 view that could never constitute a mitigating circumstance ?
24

MR. LEE;

25a sociopath.

That would be our position.

The man is

Dr. Gagliano said that there is nothing wrong

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 with his mind.

What is wrong is with his personality.

And

2 as we pointed out in our brief, he demonstrated all the
3 characteristics of a sociopath, and even his own
4 psychiatrist admitted that he had an antisocial
5 personality.

This is a lack of development in some aspects

6 of his personality, and it is demonstrated by his inability
7 to express remorse, impulsiveness, inability to respond to
8 punishment, which this Petitioner demonstrated, and
9 apparently it showed up very clearly , according to the
10 observations of all psychiatrists.
11

No, we don't think that the fact that a person is

12 a sociopath should be considered to be a mitigating
13 circumstance.
14

We don't think --

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, would you argue also that his

15 lack of maturity should not be considered, his lack of
16 development, or his lack of maturity?
17

MR. LEE:

18

QUESTION:

That is a characteristic -You would say just the chronological

19 age is a mitigating circumstance?
20

MR. LEE:

Well, as was pointed out earlier, that

21 is one of the guidelines, sophistication and maturity.
22 sociopaths -23

QUESTION:

I think it was also noted that the

24 Court doesn't have to make the finding of maturity, just
25 whether he knew right from wrong.

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

But

1

MR. LEE:

Well, It makes a determination of right

2 from wrong based on those eight guidelines, and that is
3 Guideline 6, and the certifying judge in this case
4 specifically dealth with that specific guideline.

He noted

5 that the Petitioner was in the tenth grade, but physically
6 he appeared to be much older than the way he was.
7

QUESTION:

Should that in your argument be the

8 possible mitigating circumstance, or just the chronological
9 age?
10

MR. LEE;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. LEE;

The lack of maturity?
Yes.
I think that sociopaths generally, no

13 matter what age, are going to display immature conduct.
14 They are irresponsible, and certainly the act of murder is
15 certainly an irresponsible and immature act, and our court
16 has specifically said that emotional maturity is not
17 something that the court needs to specifically find in a
18 certification proceeding.

I don’t have that listed in my

19 brief, but it is in Shurfield versus State, 511 Pacific
20 Second.

And I don't think the state should be required to

21 show that a killer is emotionally mature, because probably
22 he is not going to be, and certainly a sociopath is not
23 going to be.
24

QUESTION:

I am just asking whether that should be

25 one of the mitigating circumstances that the Court must

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 consider.
2

MR. LEE;

I would argue against it.

I would say

3 as long as he is not psychotic, as long as his thinking is
4 ordered, as long as he knows the difference between right or
5 wrong, as long as he is of average intelligence, he is not
6 suffering from mental retardation, and as long as the state
7 has properly made a certification finding, then he -- that
8 should not be a mitigating circumstance, the fact that he
9 doesn't respond to values in society like the rest of us do.
10

QUESTION;

11

MR. LEE;

That is the McNaughton rule.
Well, it is the McNaughton rule

12 according to eight guidelines.
13

QUESTION;

It is still the McNaughton rule.

He

14 mentioned it, didn't he?
15

MR. LEE;

16

QUESTION;

Yes.

Well --

The judge was guided by the McNaughton

17 rule.
18

MR. LEE;

Yes.

Well, that is in our statute, and

19 the Court of Criminal Appeals noted that that is the test of
20 criminal responsibility in Oklahoma, is the difference
21 between right or wrong, the McNaughton rule.
22

QUESTION;

And that determines it all.

You don't

23 have to worry about anything else, do you?
24

MR. LEE;

Well, I think it is a little bit more

25 sophisticated when we are talking about whether to certify a

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 not a person is insane or not.

In Oklahoma, the test to

3 determine insanity is the right versus wrong test

NR. LEE:

8

QUESTION:

Which is the KcNaughton test
Yes, Your Honor.

Yes

I thought that's what I asked you.
Yes, sir.
Well, in effect, if this Court were to

9 hold that all sociopaths were not to be executed, I suppose
10 we would be right back to where we were right after Furman,
11 because people who are well-balanced and stable or even
12 approaching well-balanced and stable don't take sawed-off
13 shotguns and shoot police officers, do they?
14

MR. LEE:

15 personality.

Well, there is something wrong with his

I agree to that.

But that is all there was.

16 He was a sociopath, and he was a young sociopath, but a
17 sociopath according to all the testimony, and we don't think
18 that -- I mean, if we get to the position of saying, if you
19 are a sociopath, that might give you a break in whether or
20 not you receive the death penalty or not, I don't think that
21 is what we want to do.
22

I don't think that is what was envisioned by this

23 Court when it said extreme emotional disturbance in Roberts
24 versus Louisiana.

I don't think that this Court ever

25 intended to require a sentencer who is looking at a person

1 who has murdered a police officer to say, well, I am going
2 to consider the fact that you are a sociopath in making this
3 determination whether you receive the death penalty.
4

I think the sentencer should consider other

5 things, and the sentencer in this case specifically
6 considered his age, but that’s the only thing that I think
7 legally should have been considered.
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Lee, may I ask you for a

9 clarification of your answer to Justice O’Connor's
10 question?

She asked you if emotional immaturity would be a

11 mitigating factor, or the maturity of the individual, and I
12 think your answer said no, provided he has average mentality
13 and lots of other qualifications.

But supposing his

14 mentality is that of an average 14-year-old instead of a
15 16-year-old, and his other general indicia of development as
16 a mature person also were characteristic of a
17 Would that be relevant in your view?

14-year-old.

I mean, as a

18 mitigating circumstance, not as an absolute bar to execution,
19

MB. LEE;

I think if he is of lower intelligence,

20 I think that should be considered -21

QUESTION;

And other factors that a psychiatrist

22 might say determine maturity in general, if they are also
23 more characteristic of an even younger person, would they
24 also be relevant?
25

MB. LEE;

Such as?

1

MR. LEE;

I think probably we are talking about

2 something different in the sentence as opposed to the
3 certification.
4

QUESTION;

Are you saying in the sentence it

5 should be a more limited inquiry or a broader inquiry?
6

MR. LEE;

I think it should be limited.

I think

7 it should be — I think the whole thrust of Gregg, and I
8 think it is what Judge Woodson tried to comply with when he
9 was making his statements, is guided discretion, and if this
10 sentencer would have considered things like the fact that he
11 got slapped around to a certain extent, I think he might
12 have felt like he was running afoul of the mandates of Gregg
13 and the other decisions that say, we want guided discretion
14 in making our decision as to whether to impose the death
15 penalty or not.
16

I think he felt like he wasn't completely free to

17 consider just anything, and Footnote 12 in Lockett says that
18 the Senator is free to exclude irrelevant factors that
19 aren't mitigating, and I think that is probably what he was
20 trying to comply with.
