ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. LACOVARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court, in a series of decisions going back at
a century, this Court has recognized the basic

principles that we believe control the case here this

12 morning.

For example, in 1875, the Court stated in

13

14 Minor against
15 the

Happersett, "Necessarily, the members of

legislature are elected by the voters of the

16 state."
17 against

In

1964, in the landmark case of Reynolds

Sims, the Court said, "Representative government

18 is in essence self-government

through the medium of

representatives of the people."

21 Sims principle,

that where once a right to vote is accorded/ it has to

2 be afforded

in a non-discriminatory manner?

MR. LACOVARA:

3

I think they do stand for more

4 than that. Justice Eehnquist, although since Puerto Rico
5 has recognized the right to vote for its legislature, it
6 might be necessary for the

Court to go no further than

7 to apply those principles, but we contend that the
8 principles that this Court has already recognized

9 demonstrate that there is an absolute obligation on the
10 part of

11

the states and by virtue of the compact between

Puerto Rico and the United States on people of Puerto

12 Rico to provide for

QUESTION;

13

an elected legislature.
What provision of the Constitution

14 gives rise to that duty?
MR. LACOVARA;

15
16 our brief,

As we have tried to explain in

Justice Rehnquist, the obligation to provide

17 for an elected state legislature appears from at least
18 two provisions of the Constitution.

One, of course, is

19 Article I, Section 2, which necessarily assumes that
20 state legislatures are elected,
21

since it provides that

the electors for the United States House of

22 Representatives must be the same as those who are the

23 electors for the state legislature.
24

In explaining that clause and other similar

25 assumptions underlying the union of states that was

election?

Now, he is not elected by the people,

12 then, is he?

13

ME. LACOVARA;

Well, originally,

Mr. Chief

14 Justice, the provisions of Article I, Section 3, called
15 for the appointment of all United States Senators by the
16 legislatures.

There was no popular election.

3

Haven’t we held that Article IV is

political question?
MR. LACOVARA;

Going back 150 years, in Luther

4

against Borden, the Court suggested that in some

5

circumstances a guarantee clause claim might be

6 non-justiciable,
7

but as Justice Brennan’s opinion for

the Court in Baker against Carr explained in

8 considerable detail,
9

the fact that certain claims under

the republican form of government clause might not be

10

justiciable does not mean that any claim under that

11

clause is non-justiciable, particularly when the

12 fundamental core of

the republican form of government is

13

at issue, and I submit that is what we have here, or

14

when other provisions of the Constitution give explicit

15

guidance to the Court on the content of the republican

16

form of government, and here, both the text of the

17

Constitution and the history before, during, and after

18

the debates on the ratification of the Constitution

19

leave, I submit, no room to doubt that the bedrock

established by the Constitution of the

21 United States is a union of states governed by elected

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 context of this case in order to place it in historical
2 perspective.

The party appointment system we think is

3 facially invalid under the First Amendment as well as
4 the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, but that
5 conclusion, I believe, becomes all the more compelling
6 when the Court appreciates that what we are talking
7 about here is not just a discriminatory system in
8 handling some political venture or some governmental
9 function.

We are talking about a discriminatory system

10 that goes to the heart of representative government
11 under the Constitution.
12

The survey that I tried to outline in our

13 brief to explain why the Constitution requires an
14 elected legislature I think implies that when vacancies
15 occur in the legislatures exercising general statewide
16 lawmaking power, the people have a continuing right to
17 have their voice heard in selecting the legislators who
18 will make the policies that will govern their lives.
19

That seems to me to be implicit in the text of

20 the Constitution, but this is another of those examples
21 in which a page of history may be worth more than a
22 volume of logic.

As we have outlined in our brief, at

23 the time the Constitution was adopted, it had been for
24 centuries the British tradition to replace vacancies in
25 the House of Commons through a bi-election.

It beggars

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the imagination, I suggest, to conclude that the

2 colonists who fought and made a revolution were

3 intending to establish a form of government where the
4 people would have fewer electoral rights than did their
5 cousins in England.
At the time the Constitution was adopted,

6

7 every one of the states that provided for filling
8 vacancies in their state legislatures, even at a time

9 when elections were held annually, provided for filling
10

those vacancies through a bi-election.
QUESTIONi

11
12

With respect to the United States

Senate vacancies that occur during the term, what

3 provision of the Constitution governs the method by
4 which the successor is to be selected?
MR. LACOVARAs

5

The Seventeenth Amendment is

6 explicit on that, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTIONi

7

Now, is it possible that one of the

8 considerations also is that to hold a bi-election for a
9 Senator on the part of the state -- I am talking now
20 about the considerations that went into that provision,
21

that it would cost a great deal more money to hold a

22 statewide election, bi-election, than a district

23 election?
24

Is that a factor that perhaps entered into it?
MR. LACOVARAi

I think it was.

The court that

25 upheld the 29-month vacancy in the New York -- the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

appointment of a Senator from New York noted that one of

2 the reasons for giving the governor power to make a
3 temporary appointment pending the holding of an election
4 was that holding statewide elections for
5 States Senate would be costly,

the United

but what I want to

6 emphasize is that the Seventeenth Amendment is of a
7 piece with Article
8

I in providing that there must be a

bi-election for members of the United States Senate,

9 just as for members of the House of Representatives.

All the Seventeenth Amendment does is

10
11

authorize the governor to make a temporary appointment

12 until the machinery for setting up a bi-election can be
13 put

into place, and that same court was quite explicit

14 in saying that the court would not sustain under the
15 Seventeenth

Amendment a statute that authorized the

16 governor to

appoint a substitute Senator for the full

17 balance of the
18 Article

term.

So, the tradition that both

I and the Seventeenth Amendment codified is the

19 tradition,

what I would consider a basic constitutional

20 presumption

of our form of government, that the people

21 have the right to select their legislative
22 representatives even though

there might be some cost or

23 burden involved.
24
25 the

Of course, as I will explain in a few moments,
cost, the burden, the inconvenience that can be

with the burden that the Seventeenth Amendment expressly

requires the states to shoulder in electing substitute

Senators.

5

district vacancy, a vacancy that arises, as this record

6

shows, quite infrequently.

7

We are talking here only about a single

The implication in the Constitution that the

8

people have the right to select their legislators is, I

9

think, fundamental.

That carries us through, I submit,

10

the right of the people to select their legislators even

11

when a vacancy occurs.

12

something that is not lost simply because of the

13

happenstance occurrence of death or resignation.

14

Legislators are, after all, elected by the people to be

15

their spokesmen, their representatives in making

16

government policy.

17

This is a continuing right,

For these reasons, we submit that any system

18

that at least in the absence of compelling justification

19

authorizes the appointment of a substitute legislator

20

fails to comply with various provisions, explicit and

21

implicit, of the United States Constitution.

22

QUESTION

i

Do you think that prior to the

23

enactment of the Seventeenth Amendment, a state could

24

have provided in a bicameral legislature for an upper

25

house whose members were each appointed, say, by the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 supervisors of one county of the state?
2

MR. LACOVARA;

Well, the Seventeenth Amendment

3 would not affect the provisions of state legislatures.
4

QUESTION;

No.

5

MR. LACOVARA:

That applies only, of course,

6 to the federal legislature.

The powers of the state to

7 provide for an appointed state senate today or
8 originally,

I think, are outside the contours of this

9 case.
10

QUESTION;

Do you have any answer to the

11 question?
12

MR. LACOVARA;

I think historically,

Justice

13 Rehnquist, the states did provide for appointed upper
14 houses.

They were more in the nature of executive

15 councils, rather than popular chambers, and since in
16 Minor against Happersett this Court said that the
17 situation as of the time of the adoption of the
18 Constitution gives us the best glimpse of what the
19 Framers meant when they spoke about a republican form of
20 government, my answer would be, apart from later
21 Constitutional Amendments, a state at that time could
22 have provided for an appointed upper house, but had to
23 provide, as it still must provide, for an elected, a
24 popularly elected lower house.
25

That was the common pattern of all of the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

States at the time the Constitution was ratified.

If

2 you will, that was a parallel reflecting the dichotomy
3

between the House of Lords and the House of Commons.

4

But what we have here today is a state lower legislative

5

house that is made by statute and Constitutional

6

provision a popularly elected chamber.

7

is a Constitutional imperative that Puerto Rico has

8

recognized, and that vacancies in it must be filled by

9

the same electoral process.

We believe that

10

Justice White a few moments ago asked about

11

alternate grounds for the relief being sought in this

12 case.

The First Amendment is a clear one.

Puerto Rico,

13

like a small minority of states, has adopted a theory of

14

party ownership which was expressly upheld against

15

federal constitutional challenge by the Supreme Court of

16

Puerto Rico.

17

legislature belongs not to the people, indeed perhaps

18

not even to the candidate whom the people elected, but

19

to the party on whose ticket the candidate won.

Under this notion, the seat in the

10 the alternative to party appointment as governor

12

Well, isn't that just a question of

language, whether you call it party ownership where a

anything ?

of the same party to fill that vacancy, so there is not

a necessary overlap between the label and the

consequences, but the rationale that was given by the

this case?

You keep bringing it up.
MR. LACOVARA;

2

Hell, I am trying to respond,

3 Justice Marshal, to some questions about the Seventeenth
4 Amendment.

To the extent that one of the assumptions of

5 the Seventeenth Amendment is applicable here at all is
6 the assumption that

there has to be a bi-election, but

7 by its terms it applies only to selecting replacement
8 members of the United States Senate.

That is not one of

9 the principal Constitutional provisions on which we rely.
QUESTION*

10

But if your basic theory was

11

correct, we probably didn’t even need the Seventeenth

12

Amendment.

13

MR. LACOVARA;

No — well, the Seventeenth

14 Amendment was necessary, Justice Stevens, because
15 Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution provides for
16 -- provided for direct legislative appointments of
17 Senators.

The state legislatures appointed Senators.

the — well, I understand your point.

QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, there were direct elections

22 of Senators long before the Seventeenth

Amendment.

It

23 was up to the states, wasn't it?
24

MR. LACOVARA;

Some states -- some states had

25 provided that they would abide by the judgment of the

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 electorate, but the Constitutional power to appoint, up
2 until the Seventeenth Amendment, remained vested in the
3 legislatures, and the official act that brought a
4 Senator to Washington was not the choice of the people,
5 but the action of the legislature.
6

QUESTION:

But if they had passed a statute

7 saying that we are going to abide by the result of an

11

MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, many of them did, and the

12 purpose of the Seventeenth Amendment was to make sure
13 that all the states recognized the importance of popular
14 sovereignty.

Again, that legislative history is traced

15 briefly in our opening brief, and its relevance, Justice
16 Marshal, is simply that it reflects the latest in what
17 we think is correctly unbroken recognition that at the

13 federal level as well as at the state level legislatures
19 must be popularly elected.

That is their basic

20 function, to serve as the representative branch of
21 government.
22

QUESTION:

That is the way you read it.

The

23 way I read it is that they decided that as for the
24 Senate, this is the way it is to be done, in the
25 Senate.

That is the way I read the Seventeenth

That's correct.

It

QUESTION!

It didn't say so.

MR. LACOVARA:

Well, the Seventeenth Amendment

the same as for selecti on of replacement

Article I,

14 brief.

The First Amendment points are outlined in our
The basic question that I think this case comes

15 down to is whether there are any compelling
16 justifications for the party appointment system that
17 Puerto Rico and a few other states have adopted.

The

18 PDP suggests in its brief before this Court that this
19 system is necessary to preserve Puerto Rico's system for
20 minority representation.
21

I submit that the Court should brush aside

22 that argument summarily.

It was not argued below, for

23 the simple reason that as the text of the Puerto Rico
24 constitution and its supporting legislative history
25 makes clear, Puerto Rico’s protection of minority

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 representation comes about through its rather complex
2 provisions for at-large seats.

The seat here in

3 question is a district seat that belongs to the

4 candidate who is elected by the majority of the members
5 of that district, the majority of the voters.
6

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico did not say a

7 word in justifying the party appointment system about
8 any connection between it and minority representation,

9 so I suggest that that issue is not one that the Court
10 need look to in examining the justifications for this

11 statute.
12

The basic justifications offered by the court

13 below were that party ownership avoids the necessity for
14 quadrennial elections by allowing appointment to fill
15 vacancies.

That argument, I suggest, is equally

16 inconsistent with the notion that a seat belongs to the
17 members of the public, to the voters.

This hostility

18 toward electoral campaigning is out of phase with this
19 Court’s own decisions on the First Amendment.
20

If the people of a district feel strongly

21 enough about the political issues that are before their
22 legislature, to want to campaign, to want to discuss
23 intensely, far from providing a justification for
24 suppressing an electoral opportunity, that seems to me
25 to provide a very dramatic reason for giving the people

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

an opportunity to expres their preference through the

2 ballot box.

If the concern here is about cost, the Chief

3

4 Justice's opinion for the Court in Bullock against
5 Carter seems to be a full answer.
6 struck down

There, the Court

a system in which candidates in primary

7 elections were required to finance those primaries in
8 order to save the

state money.

The opinion for the

9 Court pointed out

quitesoundly, in all the programs

in

10 which governments

spend money, any sensible ordering

of

11 Constitutional priorities has to put the funding of the
12

electoral process at the very top of the list of

13 priorities.

That rationale applies here.

Moreover, what we are concerned with here is

14

15 an episodic, an infrequent event.

In the last 30 years

16 since 1952, the record shows that there have been only
17 eight opportunities for vacancies to be filled in
18 district seats in

the Puerto Rico House and Senate,

19 approximately one

every four years, and these are seats

20 in narrowly
21 voters,
22 the

23

defined territories with only a few thousand

perhaps one-tenth the number of voters here in

District of Columbia, for example.
It is, I submit, inconsistent with the sound

24 notion of Constitutional principle and representative
25 government to dispense with the holding of a bi-election

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABE FORTAS, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FORTAS:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court, I confess to a certain degree of

9 astonishment in this case, that the proposition is urged
10

that there is a Federal Constitutional right or a

11

Federal Constitutional obligation imposed upon the

12 states or upon Puerto Rico to provide for the election

13 of state or Puerto Rican legislatures.

If there is any

14 fundamental proposition involved in this case that has
15 been thoroughly refuted by this Court time and time
16 again, beginning with Minor against Happensett, it is
17 that proposition.
18

On Pages 19 and 20 of our brief, we refer to

19 some of the cases and some of the statements of this
20 Court to the contrary.

For example, in addition to

21 Minor against Happensett,
22 Antonio

for example, in the San

Independent School District case, this Court,

23 through Justice Powell, said that the right to vote per
24 se is not a Constitutionally protected right.
25 Marshal, in his dissent, stated it this way;

Justice
"The right

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to vote in state elections has itself never been
2

accorded the stature of an independent Constitutional

3

guarantee."

4

The law is as stated by Justice Rehnquist

5

earlier this morning.

That is to- say that the Federal

6

Constitution does not impose upon the states/ and

7

therefore upon Puerto Rico, the requirement of providing

8

for elected legislatures, although the Federal

9 Constitution does, as this Court has constantly
10

reiterated, the Federal Constitution imposes a good many

11 obligations upon the state as to how that franchise must
12

be administered and governed once the state has decided

13

that the particular officials will be elected.

14

That is the law, and you are today invited by

15

my able friend to reverse that provision of

16

Constitutional law which is so deeply embedded in the

17 decisions of this Court.
18

Now, there is nothing in the Federal

19 Constitution that would support such an assertion.

The

20 Federal Constitution is based upon the principle that
21 the states will provide their own form of government,
22

that the states will provide how their government shall

23 be organized and how it shall be conducted, subject,
24 however, subject, however, to

very strict and rigorous

25 provisions of the Federal Constitution embodied

24

1

particularly and most practically in the equal

2

protection clause, as to how the elections will be

3

administered and how the election rights will be

4

allocated.

5

That is the basic framework of our

6

government.

7

There has never been, in Minor against Happensett or any

8

other case, any challenge to that principle as the basic

9

governing principle of our Constitution.

10

It is the basic concept of our government.

Now, let me say, if Your Honors please, that

11

so far as Puerto Rico is concerned, I respectfully

12

suggest that the observance of that principle is of even

13

greater importance than it is in the states.

14

protection clause, the basic fundamental guarantees of

15

the Constitution apply to the people of Puerto Rico as

16

they do to the people of the states.

17

The equal

Puerto Rico, as this Court has had occasion to

18

remark in different contexts, however, does have a

19

special and unique status in the American system.

20

Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory, that is to

21

say, and has always been, that is to say, there is no

22

decision by the Congress or the people of Puerto Rico as

23

to whether it will ever be assimilated into the state

24

framework of the United States.

25

contend it should be independent, and there are those,

to recognize that Puerto Rico has not only

subject to the basic Constitutional guarantees,

25 not only to provide that it has

— not only does it have

1 the same jurisdiction and power and authority as the
2 states, but that in considering problems as to the
3 Constitutionality or the propriety of what Puerto Rico
4 does in providing its local government, that there

5 should be a deference given , deference paid to its
6 unique status, to its cultural background, to its

7 history, to its differences.
8

Now, let me briefly address myself to that in

9 the context of the problem before Your Honors.

This

10 system of filling vacancies in Puerto Rico goes back to

11 1906.

That is to say, the system that when a vacancy

12 occurs in various offices, it will be filled by

13 appointment, by appointment in effect by the political
14 party, goes back to 1906, when Puerto Rico was a
15 colony.

There is no point in mincing words about it.

16 It was a colony.

It had -- under the Folacher Act,

17 which was adopted in 1900,

two years after the United

18 States obtained Puerto Rico from Spain.
19

In 1906, Puerto Rico provided that in the

20 event of a vacancy in the office of a mayor or a
21 municipal council, that vacancy would be filled until
22 the next general election by appointment or on
23 designation by the political parties.

Now, at that time

24 Puerto Rico did not elect its legislature.

The

25 legislative authority was exercised by the United States

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and by designees of the United States.

But it did have

2 authority over -- The appointment of mayors and

3 municipal councils was governed by Puerto Rican law, and
4 it was so provided.
And that party designation, Your Honors, is

5

6 deeply embedded in Puerto Rican history,

7 than we are accustomed to in the states.
8 Puerto Rico was a colony of Spain,

much more so
Even when

and before the

9 Autonomy Act enacted by Spain, which was in 1897 or
10 eight, even
11

when Puerto Rico was a colony of Spain,

party organization existed in Puerto Rico and it was

12 very powerful indeed,

and it is interesting to note that

13 the party organization then was focused on the same
14 issues that dominate party organization tod ay, namely,
15 whether Puerto Rico should be assimilated to Spain,
16 which is the counterpart of the Statehood Party now, and
17 the MPP with which the Appellants here are affiliated,
18 whether Puerto Rico should be autonomous within the
19 Spanish framework of government, which is now sort of
20 the general

counterpart of the position taken by the

21 Popular Democratic Party,

the Appellees whom I

or third, whether there should be separatism,

23 independence from Spain, those divisions have continued
24 through all these years, and through the permutations

Puerto Rico was then a colony.

for special elections to fill

Puerto Rico was given the

4 right to elect a legislature then.

In 1938, that provision in the Jones Act was

5
6 changed

by the Congress, and it is very interesting to

7 note, as we have set forth in our brief, it was changed
8 on

recommendation of the non-voting delegate in the

9 Congress, which is

all that Puerto Rico now has.

He

10

said that between 1917 and 1938, there have been

11

vacancies in the Puerto Rican legislature, but those

12 vacancies have not been filled, because special election
13 was required.

14

that Congress provide that

Congress changed the Organic Act of Puerto Rico

provision which in essence

and in principle is the same provision that we are

22 talking about here today.
23
24 In

Now, the next event in this history is 1952.
1952, the people of Puerto Rico adopted their own

25 constitution.

That was pursuant to a compact in Public

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Law 600 that was entered into between the Congress and

2 the

people of Puerto Pico.

As the Court knows, Puerto

3 Rico was still subject to the territorial clause of the
4 Constitution of the United States.

Congress had in

5 theory complete power to dispose of Puerto Rico, make
6 rules for it, and in Public Law 600

there was this

7 compact entered into, which was a historic document that
8

had great influence throughout the world.

It provided a

9 model on which some other nations revised their
10 arrangements with their erstwhile territories.
11

And it is that constitution that various

12 members of this Court have had

occasion to write about

13 in opinions of this Court in different contexts.

It was

14 that constitution that provided that Puerto Rico shall
15 have control in effect of its own destiny, its own
16 government, subject to two things.

One is the

17 fundamental protections of the United States
18 Constitution, more or less as stated in the old insular
19 cases, and two, subject to the specific arrangements
20 with

the federal government, such as free trade and

21 various types of specific provisions.
22

That was a great Act.

It was an Act that

23 affirmed the uniqueness, as this Court has stated it, of
24 the system of Puerto Rico, and it allowed them to
25 organize their own government, which they did in their

31

Now, it is very interesting to note that in

3 the Puerto Rican constitution as it was originally

there were two types of provisions that related

Now, with respect to vacancies, the

14 at-large seats would be filled in the historic manner,
15 namely on recommendation of the political party to which
16 the incumbent -- with

18 and

With respect to district Representatives

who were responsible for the drafting

that Constitution.

And that reflected their view.

But it

It didn't work in Puerto Rico, and the

4 result was that just as it didn't work under the Jones
5 Act, the first Organic Act, and had to be changed in
6 1938 by the

Congress, so this didn't work either for

7 Puerto Rico, and in 1964, the people of Puerto Rico
8 adopted an amendment to their constitution

which

9 provided that the selection -- that the filling of
10 vacancies for district representatives,

which is the

11 specific thing involved here, would be governed
12

by laws

enacted by the Puerto Rican legislature.

20 and

I will have to take a minute to describe that, if I

21 may. Justice White.
22

In Puerto Rico, from the beginning of

23 elections, elections are held once every four years.
24 Once every four years there is an election for all
25 offices, local and legislative, mayors, councils, and

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the legislature.

Until the last

until 1977, I think

2 it was, the way they ran the election was this.

All

3 Puerto Rican voters assembled in a particular place, at
4 particular polling places, at or before the appointed
5 hour.

The doors were then closed.

Nobody could enter

6 the polling places after the appointed hour.

Nobody

7 could leave until all the voting was over.
8

It was a wonderful system to prevent

9 repetition.

Then it turned out it was a great fiesta.

10 At the same time, at the same time, in the Puerto Rican
11

elections, this question of status, this question of

12 status is a highly emotional, disruptive thing.

I don't

13

have to tell the Court about what happens, what has been

14

happening and has happened with respect to the

15

nationalist movement in Puerto Rico, which is the

16 advocates of independence through violence, and passions
17

about this question of status there are unimaginable to

18

appeared in the election.

QUESTION:

KR. FORTAS:

It manifested itself in the fact

14 t ha t there were some positions that were just allowed to

16 dis trict representatives.

Well, the at-large people --

17 I s hould have made clear, if I didn* t, that the
18 pro vision for filling at-large vacan cies remained the
19 sam e throughout.

They were not

You had the passions of the election that

3 occurred on more than a four-year basis.

Now, we may

4 like that or not like it, but it is nevertheless true
5 that the people of Puerto Rico would prefer to have the
6 passions every four

years instead of once in a while,

7 instead of occasionally.
QUESTION:

8

Was there any element in the

9 unworkability in this sense that if there is going to be
10

an election, an open election, it may be that the other

11

party would win the election, and the balance in the

12

existing legislature would be upset --

13

MR. FORTAS;

14

QUESTION:

No,

the —

-- or did they just prefer to have,

15 every four years, they wanted to — once you had an
16 election, you were going to maintain that particular
17 balance or proportion for the full four years?
MR. FORTAS;

18

I think there was more of the

19 latter, but you have here a situation where people are
20 accustomed
21

to an election fiesta every four years, and I

may say, Justice White, that there are -- that the

22 results in Puerto Rico are fantastic.

There is about 90

23 percent registration of eligible voters; about 80
24 percent of the eligible voters vote, more than 80
25 percent of them.

It is a record that is unequalled

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

anywhere else.

And it's a record that they prefer, and

2

I see nothing in the Federal Constitution that impacts

3

upon this.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - REBUTTAL

MR. LACOVARA:

22 comments by

I have just a few brief

way of reply to my learned colleagues's

23 arguments.

First, with respect to the argument that

status, its affiliation with the

proposition that this Court has

the Court.

The cases are

Whatever the Court decides today

7 necessarily affects not only Puerto Rico but those
8 states that have systems comparable to Puerto Rico’s.

Secondly, with respect to the history, Puerto

10

Rico has provided for an elected legislature since the

11

Organic, the Jeforacher Act of 1900, and since 1902

12 there was provision for holding popular bi-elections to
13 fill vacancies in the legislature.
14 appointment

The system of party

in other offices other than the House of

15 Delegates of Puerto Rico was not adopted until 1938.
16 So,

for almost all of the period from the acquisition of

17 Puerto Rico from Spain up until
18 and

the legislature of Puerto Rico recognize the

19 importance of popular

bi-elections.

Finally, with respect to party appointment, I

agree with my learned colleague that political parties

status.

They have

But as this Court’s decisions

political parties have Constitutional status

25 because they are private associations.

That is why they

are protected against government interference by the

It stands those principles on their

heads, I submit, to say that a kind of institution that

has Constitutional status because of its private nature

may be given the ownership of public office, the

The judgement below should be reversed.
