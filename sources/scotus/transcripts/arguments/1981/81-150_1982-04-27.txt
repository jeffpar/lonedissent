ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT UNITED STATES

9

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

10

Court, at issue in this case is the constitutionality of

11

the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 which represents Congress'

12

most comprehensive effort in this century and perhaps in

13

history to deal with bankruptcies.

14

The problems that Congress identified were

15

serious, including an increase in the number of annual

16

filings from 10,000 a year to over 254,000 a year in a

17

period of only three decades.

18

impediments to an efficient bankruptcy system. Congress,

19

found, was the court system and particularly the

20

confusing distinction between summary and plenary

21

jurisdiction.

22

One of the most serious

The 1978 Act creates a bankruptcy act in each

23

district as an adjunct to the District Court.

The

24

judges of the new Bankruptcy courts are to be appointed

25

to 14-year terms by the President with the advice and

Wasn't this on a phased-in basis,

Mr. Solicitor General?
MR. LEE*

That is correct — six years.

the personnel, over the interim period.

10

QUESTION*

11

MR. LEE*

In 1984 the appointments would be —
That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

That is correct.
It is the government's position that the

Constitution does not preclude Congress-chosen

15

resolution of the important and difficult bankruptcy

16

problems that Congress identified.

17

specification of Congressional power to establish

18

uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout

the United States includes the power to establish

20

specialized bankruptcy courts and give them plenary

21

jurisdiction over their narrow specialty — bankruptcy.

22

Article I

There is nothing in the language of Article

23

III nor its values that brings that Article into

24

conflict in this case with Article I.

HR. LEE:

5

QUESTION:

6

HR. LEE:

Certainly not.
But how do you distinguish?
On the basis of the guidelines that

7

this Court laid down in Palmore, which were that you

8

have to have — first of all» of course, you have to

9

have one of the — a specific grant of legislative

10
11

authority to Congress.
But, in addition, you have to have a

12

specialized area in which Congress concludes that there

13

is a particularized need warranting distinctive

14

treatment for a specialized court.

15

QUESTION:

16

HB. LEE:

17

QUESTION:

Can I stop you there?
Surely.
When you say a "specialized area",

18

do you mean an area where the judges filling the courts

19

will have a specialized comptetence in a particular

20

branch of law?

21

HB. LEE:

As — my answer to that is yes.

22

Justice Rehnquist.

23

Palmore, I believe that is what the Court meant by

24

specialized area, and certainly that is our view of what

25

is meant by specialized area.

QUESTION;

But then it seems to me you have

3

real trouble with this statute because the jurisdiction

4

vested in the bankruptcy judges just covers the whole

5

gamut of cases.

6

MR. LEE*

That is one of the major criticisms

7

that is raised against it by our opponents.

My answer

8

to that is two-fold.

9

does include a number of possible types of actions that

The first is that the fact that it

10

the bankruptcy judge can entertain gets right to the

11

heart of the fundamental problems that Congress

12

identified as the serious impediment to an efficient and

13

a fair bankruptcy system.

14

QUESTIONS

Is there a severability clause in

15

the Acts that would sever the non-bankruptcy matters

16

from the bankruptcy?

17

MR. LEE*

I am not aware of a severability

18

clause. Your Honor, but, of course, this Court has

19

clarified on many occasions that that is not dispositive

20

and, in effect, that the Court will interpret it in such

21

a way as to —

22

QUESTION*

Well, for example, if the habeas

23

corpus jurisdiction were appealed to with respect to a

24

bankruptcy judge and even though may people were

25

somewhat puzzled by what habeas corpus has to do with

9009A ^9091 554-2345

1

bankruptcy, but if the issue was raised there, could a

2

court declare that section, the habeas corpus

3

jurisdiction, violative of the Constitution without

4

damaging the rest of the Act?
MR. LEEj

5

I would think clearly so, and I

6

would think also that there are other means available

7

ultimately to this Court and, indeed, short of this

8

Court that would be less severe, such as the Doctrine of

9

Abstention is applicable in the case of the bankruptcy

10

court.

11

leads to Article III determination and ultimately,

12

therefore, to this Court.

13

It, of the three avenues of appeal, eventually

I realize that there is a parade of horribles

14

that has been suggested.

15

suggested is that the distinction between plenary and

16

summary jurisdiction led to a circumstance in which so

17

many times in the complicated bankruptcy cases, and

18

sometimes in the non-complicated ones, all of the assets

19

of the bankrupt were being consumed by litigating this

20

subject of whether it was summary or was plenary.

21

The reason that it has been

The bankrupt could have his assets — his

22

assets distributed and could be declared a bankrupt, but

23

in the event that he had a claim that needed to be

24

satisfied or in the event that a claim needed to be

25

satisfied against the bankrupt, that could not be

handled by the particular court.

And that is the

2

problem that Congress attempted to satisfy.
Sow the theory, as has been suggested here,

3
4

that this could lead to a rather broad range of

5

potential types of lawsuits that would traditionally be

6

handled by Article III courts, that could under the

7

statute be handled by the Article I court.
The first answer to that is that that is the

8
9

very type of problem that Congress saw as the most

10

serious'problem that was precluding an efficiency

11

bankruptcy system.

12

case it will be a sufficient case of the Article I tail

13

wagging the Article III dog, that there might be either

14

some administrative problems, some prudential problems,

15

or even some problems that would rise to the level of

16

constitutionality.

Now it may be that in some other

But that is not this case.

17

This case lies

18

right at the core of the very problem that everyone

19

agreed Congress needed to take care of, where the

20

bankrupt had a claim against someone else, that in the

21

process of his reorganization petition needed to be

22

resolved.

23

constitutional problems raised by the parade of

24

horribles, that is for another case and, indeed, I

25

suspect that as is the case with the continuing

interpretation of many complex statutes it will be

QUESTIONS

3

Well, taking this very case for a

4

moment, before this statute was passed, could the

5

bankruptcy referee ha-e entered a binding judgment in

6

this particular dispute?

7

MR. LEE;

8

QUESTION;

9

Only if the parties consented.
And if they did not consent, they

could not have?

10

MR. LEE;

11

QUESTION;

That is correct.

That' is correct.

And is it clear that the

12

non-Article III judge does have the power -- you don't

13

have any problem with him entering a binding judgment in

14

a matter dependent upon state law between private

15

parties?
MR. LEE;

16
17

20

It is, of

course, subject to —
QUESTION;

18
19

That is our position.

Is there any precedent for that at

all?
MR. LEE;

Well, there is the precedent in the

21

MacDonald v. Plymouth, and Schumacher v. Beeler cases

22

that that could be done by consent.

23

those were — those were true adjuncts to the Article

24

III court in those days, and that's my opponent's answer

25

to that proposition.

Our rejoinder to it — to save a little bit of

1

2

his time by making his rejoinder — our rejoinder to it

3

is that in the Schumacher v. Beeler case the court, in

4

talking about this consent jurisdiction to decide those

5

kinds of cases, referred — and I am quoting from page

6

374 — the Court said, "The Congress, by virtue of its

7

constitutional authority over bankruptcies, could confer

8

or withhold jurisdiction to entertain such suits,”

9

which, at least by way of dictum, says that this court

10

can do that very thing.
But the big point. Justice Stevens, in my

11
12

view, is this.

It is beyond dispute that this Court has

13

held in a number of contexts in the past that Article

14

III does not exhaust Congress* power to establish

15 courts, and the mere fact that there is no precedent for
16

this one, no square precedent for it, should not be that

17

surprising because there was no square precedent for

18 Palmore or for Bakelite or for Crowell v. Benson.
The control that is imposed on Congress’ power

19
20

to establish courts other than under Article III is the

21

control that was articulated in Palmore v. the United

22

States.

23

need, a special area, requiring expertise requiring

That is to say, there must be a particularized

24 distinctive treatment.
25

QUESTION:

Do you think special area language,
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

General Lee, might refer to a geographical area rather

2

than —

3

MR. LEE*

No, I do not, and, of course, it is

4 fruitless for me to tell this Court what it meant by
5

specialized area.

There are the two different views,

6

but I submit that if the Court in Palmore had meant

7 specialized area to mean Federal real estate, it would
8

have said so.

Usually when this Court refers to

9

enclaves it does not refer to them as specialized areas.

10

And, even more important, when you look at the

11

whole concept of Congress’ power to create non-Article

12

III courts, it does tie back to the fact that some

13 subject matters, some subject areas, by their nature do
14

require specialized courts, and bankruptcy is one of

15

those for two reasons.

16

The first reason is that if you look at that

17 list, 17 powers, 17 clauses that consist of — that
18 constitute Article I, Section 8, of all of them there is
19 none that is linked quite so directly to the resolution
20
21

22

of private disputes as does bankruptcy.
QUESTION*

Could Congress, Mr. Solicitor

General, have made the administration of bankruptcy

23 problems totally and wholly administrative with
24 traditional judicial review without having any judges at
25 all in the bankruptcy area?
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. LEE;

My answer to that question is yes

2

Congress could have done that.

3

that Congress —

5

QUESTION;

That is not the area

You mean even resolving the dispute

in this case?
MR. LEE;

why it would have been ineffective.

Then answer to the Chief Justice is

no •
MR. LEE;

11

Well, they could not have — yes,

12

well.

I simply misunderstood the Chief Justice — the

13

thrust of the Chief Justice's question.

14

Coming back to Justice O'Conner’s question —

15

QUESTION;

16

the Chief Justice’s question?
MR. LEE;

17

Well, what's your present answer to

Well, my answer is that Congress

18

could have solved this problem by relegating whatever

19

power it could constitutionally have given to

20

administrative agencies, but I do not think it could

21

have given — I don’t think it could constitutionally

22 have given to administrative entities the power to do
23

the kinds of things that these judges have the power to

24

do.

25

QUESTION;

Name one.

What is it?

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

SR. LEEs

Hell, entertain the suit in this

2

case.

I think that whatever — that either under

3

Article III or Article I there is a certain

4

responsibility when it comes to deciding matters of that

5

magnitude that they must be constituted with a judge.
And, indeed, if you look at the history of

6
7

bankruptcy in this country, there has been about a

8

two-century experiment with how to do it best.

9

from the beginnings of our republic, in 1800 the first

Almost

10

bankruptcy statute was passed, and from then until 1841

11

bankruptcy actions were strictly involuntary and

12

retaliatory.

13

bankrupt.

14

They could only be used against the

The 1841 change provided for voluntary

15

proceedings, and then, in 1898, there was the last major

16

change, when Congress brought into existence the referee

17

system with power to exercise summary jurisdiction.

18

The one constant feature over almost two

19

centures of bankruptcy is that this is a field that has

20

been separate and specialized.

21

anything but separate and specialized and, therefore.

22

Justice O’Conner, I conclude that for this reason —

23

plus the fact that bankruptcy itself really, almost by

24

definition, anticipates the resolution of private

25

controversies — this, above all cases — this above all

It has never been

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

other areas is a specialized area.
QUESTIONi

2

Yes, but when you graft onto that

3

the jurisdictional or this wide range of other cases is

4

where you get into the problem.

5

it can even cover marital dissolution cases in state

6

courts.

There is virtually no limit.
MR. LEEt

7

8

I assume under the Act

There are some who have suggested

that, and my simple answer to that is that is not this

9 case.

It is going to be difficult enough, at best, to

10

solve this case, and you don’t need to solve the next

11

one in the process of this one.
This case involves a commercial dispute in

12
13

which the creditor had a contract — excuse me, the

14

debtor had a contract claim and this is right at the

15

core of what Congress intended.

16

least as far as I understand, part of the parade of

17

horribles.

And this is not, as

18

One final point with respect to Palmore.

19

the extent that there are any distinctions between

20

Palmore and this case, they cut in favor of the

21

constitutionality of the 1978 Act.

22

of the distinctions is that this case does involve

23

bankruptcy, which, as I say, does anticipate the

24

resolution of conflicting private claims.

25

second is that this case, that Palmore involved a

To

One is that — one

And the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

2

criminal prosecution and this case involves bankruptcy.
In terms of relevant constitutional values, if

3

there is to be a distinction between criminal

4

prosecutions on the one hand and bankruptcy on the

5

other, certainly there is greater need for the

6

protection of the more independent Article III judge

7

where the interests at stake affect life and liberty as

8

well as property, and I would like to reserve the rest

9 of my time.
10

QUESTIONj

Well, one distinction between this

11

and Palmore is that Palmore dealt with an area of 67

12

square miles, and this covers the whole country.

13

MB. LEE:

That is correct, but that is only

14 saying. Justice Rehnquist, one arose under Clause 17 and
15 this one arises under Clause 4.
16

QUESTION:

But I think Palmore is more like

17 Kanter in that respect.

That is correct, and this one is

dealing with an Article III court as opposed to an

Article I or a legislative court.

9

and I think this is obviously the Solicitor's

And in that regard —

10

position — it's our view that we're dealing with a

properly constituted legislative court.

12

How early in this argument Justice Rehnquist

13

asked, I believe, what the limits were on Congress for

14

the creation of legislative courts.

with some idea of that, but at least as a lawyer who's

read these rather difficult cases several times, the

only true answer to that is, I don't know.

18

QUESTION*

19

HR. DEYNEIi

History provides us

You have a lot of company.
I think that there is — I think

20

we know that the outer limits of that power is the

existence of an enumerated power in Article I.

22

the limitation, although I agree that Palmore sets up a

23

condition that may have been appropriate in Palmore, I

24

don't think it represents the outer limits of Congress*

ability to set up Article I courts.

MR. DEVNEY:

QUESTION;

HR. DEVNEY*

I sure do.

I think that's what

the statute very plainly says.
QUESTION*

The statute was originally drafted

with the Article III courts in mind, was it not?
HR. DEVNEY*

In the House of Representatives I

think that's true, Your Honor.
The point that I think it is important to

16

recognize here is that when we talk about Kanter, when

17

we talk about Palmore, when we talk about the

18

territories, we are talking about something that is

19

rather anomalous if we reflect on it for a moment, and I

20

think the anomaly arises out of the fact that people

21

tend to think of the Article III judicial requirements

22

only in terms of what's been referred to in the briefs

23

here as "federalism".

24
25

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MELVIN I. ORENSTEIN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. ORENSTEIN*

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, the constitutional challenge which is

12

raised by Marathon in this matter is based upon Article

13

III of the Constitution.

That section of the

14 Constitution mandates that when the judicial power —
15

QUESTION*

Would you raise your voice a little

16 bit, Mr. Orenstein?
MR. ORENSTEIN*

17

Yes.

That section of the

18 Constitution mandates that when the judicial power of
19 the United States is being exercised, the judges
20

exercising that power must be vested with the salary and

21

tenure protections of Article III of the Constitution.

22

The bankruptcy judges serve for 14 years.

23 Their salary is subject to diminution by Act of
24 Congress.

They exercise the judicial power of the

25 United States independent of the control of the Article

jurisdiction in this matter is unconstitutional.

QUESTION;

How does that compare with the

situation of the Court of Military Appeals?
MR. ORENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I believe that the

6

Court of Military Appeals is based upon the principle

7

that the commander-in-chief has a power to discipline

8

his forces.

9

Now that is the power --

But wasn't the court created as a

10

civilian court, in effect as a check or a second look at

11

18

MR. ORENSTEINs

That may be, but. Your Honor --

Hell, don't you think it is?
The Military Court of Appeals?

Yes.
Yes.

That was the purpose of it.
Yes, but I think that those —

19

the case you're raising, the military courts and the tax

20

courts, for example, I think they fall within a

21

particular category of cases which allow those courts to

22

exercise jurisdiction which is not the jurisdiction of

23

Article III of the Constitution.

24
25

I say that for this reason.

There is a

principle that this Court has developed in the past that
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

certain kinds of power is susceptible to judicial

2

determination but in the first instance it may be

3

exercised by the executive or the Congress because that

4

department can exercise that power independent of the

5

judicial system.

6

For example, in the military court situation I

7

think it's been recognized that the power which is being

8

exercised by the military courts in the first instance

9

is a power which stems from the power of the

10

commander-in-chief to discipline his forces.

11

doesn’t involve the determination of contract rights or

12

matters of national application as you have in the

13

bankruptcy courts — a very narrowly circumscribed area.

14

That

It is circumscribed as to time and to place

15

and I think that that principle allows Congress to

16

create courts outside of the structure of the

17

Constitution.

18

kinds of values that are protected by Article III are

19

the separation of powers at the Federal level and the

20

division of powers between the Federal government and

21

the states.

22

impaired, in my judgment, then Congress has been allowed

23

by this Court to create courts outside of that structure.

24
25

In effect, Your Honor, the kinds — the

22

HR. ORENSTEIN*

23

QUESTION*

24
25

Yes, that's right.

But I suppose all questions in law

are subject to being reviewed.
MB. ORENSTEIH*

Questions of law would be
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

subject to review, that is correct, but it seems to me

2

that the factfinding process is the important process

3

which is involved here, and that to in some way take the

4

position that that process, if it's subject to review,

5

is sufficient to satisfy the Article III values, it

6

seems to me is to ignore the reality of the factfinding

7

process and its impact in a trial situation.

8
9

And I just can't believe that the appeal
process is the kind of process which this Court would

10

consider as satisfactory to meet the Article III

11

standards — or the delegation standards which this

12

Court has articulated in the Baddatz case, in United

13

States v. Baddatz.

14

QUESTION*

Mr. Orenstein, Isn't there another

15

consideration?

16

supposing nobody ever takes an appeal.

17

possible that the acts of the bankruptcy judges and

18

bankruptcy courts will have the force and effect of a

19

regular judgment?

20

Maybe I misunderstand the statute, but

MB. OBENSTEIN*

That's right.

Isn't it

And there's a

21

further problem.

22

panels of bankruptcy judges that are set up as an appeal

23

court, so we now have a situation where you'd have to

24

take two appeals in order to get up to an Article III

25

judge, and it seems to me as a practical matter that

In the bankruptcy setting we have now

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

that just, in most cases, can't happen.

It's just too

2

much of a burden to require people to take two appeals

3

to get up to an Article III judge to get the kind of

4

protection that the Article III section of the

5

Constitution deems to be so important.
And it seems to me you also get to the remand

6
7

problem.

If you're going to go all the way up, you

8

ultimately are going to come all the way down before an

9

Article I judge who is going to make that decision.

So

10

that no matter how you slice it, ultimately, if you will

11

take that approach — the appeal approach — to satisfy

12

Article III, you wind up with an Article I judge — or,

13

rather, a non-Article III officer deciding important

14

values which Article III was designed to protect.

15

QUESTION*

Aren't you now addressing the

16

wisdom of the statute of deferring the time when Article

25

This is the same situation which has occurred or existed

I don’t believe that the kind of problem or

horribles, perhaps, paraded around here, but, as I say,

this is a situation we've existed with all these years.

7

QUESTIOHs

Yyou say that you are not attacking

8

all of them.

Now, going to this matter of convenience

9

or inconvenience, could, conceivably, an Article III

10

court somewhere decide that the appeal from the

12

three-panel Article I group was either unconstitutional

13

or else under the supervisory powers of the court,

possibly,

16

of Appeals and then solve that problem?

17

but only possibly, that there must be an

MR. ORENSTEINi

Well, as I have indicated,

18

Your Honor, I think that it's not a question of

process satisfies the control relationships which have

21

to exist between an Article III court and this

22

delegate.

I officer

24

rights between these parties.

25

In my judgment, in effect you have an Article
for all practical purposes deciding the final

And there is a constitutional provision which
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

very clearly, it seems to me, says that both the judges

2

of the Supreme Court and the inferior courts must be

3

vested with these salary and tenure protections.

4

never intended, I think, constitutionally that we could

5

have a layer of Federal trial courts at the district

6

level who didn't have to be tenured.

It was

It seems to me the same proposition applies,

7

8

and when Congress creates inferior federal courts, I

9

think it is required by constitutional mandate that they

10

tenure those judges.
QUESTION*

11

Hr. Orenstein, how do you

12

distinguish the case of the magistrates that we were

13

concerned with in Raddatz?
HR. ORENSTEIN*

14

I really don't distinguish

15

it.

I think that the magistrates — that case is a good

16

model, it seems to me, for what we have here.

17

that that case, which laid down two broad principles, as

18

I understand them — the principles were that the final

19

decision has to be made by the Article III judge and,

20

secondly, that the delegate has to serve — the

21

magistrate, the non-Article III officer has to serve —

22

in an advisory, subordinate capacity to the Article III

23

judge.

24

complete and direct control of the activities of that

25

magistrate.

I think

That is, the Article III judge must have

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Sow in the magistrates cases — and of course

1

2

that was sustained.

The delegation of power in that

3

case was sustained and it seems to me it was sustained

4

because, as this Court said, there was complete control

5

over the activities of that non-Article III officer and

6

the Court did make the final decision.
Sone of that is present here.

7

When a case

8

comes into the bankruptcy court it starts off by

9

complaint.

It goes to discovery.

It goes to trial by

jury and it goes to judgment in the bankruptcy court.

of Appeals.

Or do they have to petition an

Article III judge to get it enforced?
MS. ORENSTEIN*

That may be ture.

I am not

That may be true, but when they

petition for enforcement, the Article III court has no

10

authority to upset any factfinding that is supported by

substantial evidence.

But you have a different
That principle is based upon

Where did they get that, to decide

these cases?
MR. ORENSTEIN*

Okay.

This Court has long ago

21

stated that there are certain kinds of factfinding

22

functions which can be delegated to an agency, and

23

that's done on the basis of —

25

QUESTION*

What about — what's the matter

with delegating pursuant to the bankruptcy power, the
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

kind of factfinding that is delegated to these

2

bankruptcy judges?

3

MR* ORENSTEIN;

Because there are certain

4

areas in which this Court has said the Congress can make

5

this kind of a delegation and these are areas involving

6

public rights where a sovereign is suing to enforce a

7

particular statute under Federally-enacted legislation.

8

There are certain kinds of rights that —

9

QUESTION;

The sovereign isn't suing for

10

anything in the National Labor Relations Board.

11

parties ligitate before it.

12

MR. ORENSTEIN:

Okay.

Private

Then if it is a private

13

party situation, then you have to have, as this case

14

said in the Crowell case, you must have a relationship

15

between that factfinder and the Article III court which

16

is a properly controlled relationship.

17

we're complaining about here.

QUESTION:

And that's what

Do you think as long as the

QUESTION;

3

Let me back up to one of your

4

earlier responses.

It gave me the impression that you

5

thought that the Congress of the United States had to

6

get some leave or approval from the judiciary in order

7

to create the Labor Board or the Federal Communications

8

Commission.
Congress was exercising its own inherent

9
10

constitutional powers, was it not, when they created

11

these agencies?
MB. ORENSTEIN;

12
13

yes.

When it creates agencies,

I didn't intend to say —
QUESTION;

14

Now the Federal Communication

15

Committee can give — Commission can give or it can take

16

away a broadcast license worth hundreds of millions of

dollars.

18

NR. ORENSTEIN;

19

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

And that’s subject to review by a

20

court of appeals in the first instance, but, as Justice

21

White pointed out, the court of appeals is at least

22

bound to affirm what the Commission has done if it’s

23

supported by substantial evidence, even if they disagree

24

with the result reached, is that not so?

25

HR. ORENSTEIN;

That’s right.

It's true of the Federal Power

Commission?
HE. ORENSTEIN:

Yes, but, you know, now. Your

4

Honor, you're moving into the whole area of agency

factfinding power which I think is controlled by some

6

different principles, and the kind of principle you're

7

trying to apply here, at least this Court in the past —

QUESTION;

What is it — what is that

MR. ORENSTEIN;

It's a doctrine which this

Court has announced in the past.

21

MR. ORENSTEIN;

22

So here's a dispute

Your Honor, I believe —

And no court can touch it.
Yeah, but that's under a

public statute, as I understand it.

23

QUESTION:

What is it?

24

MR. ORENSTEIN;

25

QUESTION;

I understand it's under —

Under a public statute?
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. ORENSTEIN:

Well, a statute which confers

2

a public right upon the individuals.

3

not the private rights.

4

It's not — it's

Your Honors, it seems to me if you were to

5

employ that principle that you can take private rights

6

and matters under the antitrust laws and matters under

7

the whole range of federal legislation and move them out

8

of the Article III protection that you have in effect

9

nullified the Article III values.

10

It seems to me this Court has very carefully

11

in the last year or so, in the Hubert F. Will case

12

articulated and affirmed those values as being as

13

important today as they were 200 years ago, and it just

14

seems to me that if you consider those values as being

15

important that you can't allow a process by which

16

Congress can erode or eat way into the Article III

17

jurisdiction.

18

It seems to me that this Court has, from time

19

to time, very carefully tried to develop principles

20

which avoid that problem.

21

QUESTION:

Suppose that when Congress passed

22

this act it had called these bankruptcy people

23

bankruptcy magistrates and —

24

HR. ORENSTEIN:

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

What about it.

Does the name make

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

any difference in terms of their function?
MR. ORENSTEIN*

2

The label does not make any

3

difference, in my judgment.

It's what they can do and

4

what they can't do that makes the difference.
The whole Magistrates Act really is built

5

6

pretty well to cover the problem.

The Magistrates Act

7

says, you know, that the Article III judge has got the

8

power to refer and has got the power to determine what

9

kind of conditions to make reference.

He's got the

10

power to withdraw.

He's got the power to accept,

modify, reject, and take new evidence.

for those magistrates.

13

which protects the jury rights of those parties.

QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. Orenstein, in your

home state of Minnesota you had a territorial federal

court at one time, and — but let me ask a question

8

before you sit down that I'd like to have your comment

9

on .

10

This Act has been in effect for a little while.

11

MR. ORENSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

And certainly there have been a lot

13

of bankruptcy proceedings and related proceedings that

14

have gone down through the process.

15

Lord's opinion should be, or judgment should be affirmed

16

here, do you have any comment on how the

17

unconstitutionality can be cured with all of these

18

things in the background.

19

20

and void?
MR. ORENSTEIN:

21

If Chief Judge

It is to operate

Your Honor, first let me say

22

that I'm not asking that we go as far as Judge Lord

23

went.

24

and I — as far as I'm concerned, the focus of this case

25

is narrower.

He struck down the entire quantum of jurisdiction

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

But, you know, this Court has, from time to

1

2

time, struck down jurisdictional exercises, for example

3

the O'Callahan v. Parker case, and there was a

4

bankruptcy case, by the way, called Chicotte County

5

Drainage District v. Baxter Bank in which the bankruptcy

6

court jurisdiction was stuck down, exactly the same kind

7

of problem we have here, and the Court held that on

8

collateral attack when another creditor tried to bring

9

it up in a later suit that it was res judicata.

And so

10

those cases, all the cases that have gone to judgment

11

and sworn are res judicata.

12

Insofar as the retroactivity or prospectivity,

13

this Court in a number of cases has treated that issue.

14

One was Gross v. Maiden, and there are some others,

15

where this Court has — in effect, it took the

16

O'Callahan case and — where that jurisdiction had been

17

knocked out — and said that that case would not apply

18

retroactively.

19

We apply prospectivity.

So I feel this Court has left itself plenty of

20

room in this area to work out those kind of problems so

21

as not to result in any major dislocations.

22

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT UNITED STATES

9

MR. LEE:

10

spoke of Article III values.

11

constitutional values that are implicated in this case.

12

They come from two sources — Article I and Article

13

III — both a part of the Constitution and both must be

14

taken into account.

15

Just very briefly, Mr. Orenstein
There are two

On the Article I side. Congress has the

16

responsibility to establish uniform laws of bankruptcy.

17

This Court has clarified in several opinions — Rostker

18

and Palmore among them — that Congress is entitled to

19

particular deference that there is evidence that

20

Congress actually analyzed the constitutional and did

21

its best to resolve it.

22

The legislative history leaves no doubt that

23

Congress, when it enacted the 1978 Act, had before it

24

the Palmore standards and did its best to apply them.

25

Those standards, by their very definition -48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

specialization of the area, particularization of the

2

need, and distinctiveness of the appropriate

3

treatment — are the kind of thing that lend themselves

4

best to congressional factfinding and decision.
On the Article III side, it is frankly

5

6

difficult to see what damage, if any, has been done by

7

this Act.

8

consideration of this case — and, frankly, I was

9

puzzled during Hr. Orenstein's argument.

I have been puzzled throughout my entire

I am not

10

certain whether the opponents of this statute would like

11

it to be more like an Article III court or less like an

12

Article III court.

13

But in any event, we agree with the Appellee

14

on this proposition, that the tenure and compensation

15

guarantees are rooted in separation of powers concerns

16

in the sense that the independence of the judiciary with

17

which we are concerned is largely an independence from

other branches of government.

6

That is the case with the

It is not the case with bankruptcy.
The Appellee's view is, apparently, that

7

Congress must either give primary jurisdiction over

8

bankruptcy to the district courts, which Congress have

9

determined over eight years of consideration of this

10

problem will not work, or confer Article III status on

11

bankruptcy courts, thereby swelling the ranks of the

12

tenured judiciary in a proportion that has never

13

occurred in this country and would raise serious

14

questions about diluting the quality of the Article III

15

judiciary and there is evidence of that concern in the

16

House report.

17

I know of nothing in the Constitution, and

18

certainly nothing in common sense, that so limits

19

Congress' choices and the decision of the district court

should be reversed.
