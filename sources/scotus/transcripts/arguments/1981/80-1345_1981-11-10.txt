ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. DOUGLAS MELAMED, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MELAMED;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court, this case presents one basic
10 issue.

The issue is whether a federal court will enforce a

11 contract provision that violates the federal antitrust and

12 labor laws and has been declared by Congress to be
13 unenforceable and void.
14

Until this case, no court had ever enforced a

15 contract provision that was alleged to be illegal without
16 resolving the illegality defense on the merits.

The courts

17 below nevertheless made that unprecedented decision.

18

The basic facts that should be presumed are as

19follows.

Since 1971, the United Mine Workers Union has

20 insisted on including in all of its contracts a provision
21 that would require employers to make payments payable to the
22UMK health and welfare fund for every ton of coal they
23 purchase from a non-UMW producer.

This provision, called

24 the purchase of coal clause, is intended to induce UMW

25signatories not to purchase coal from and thus to boycott

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 non-UMW producers, and to penalize companies like Kaiser
2 Steel that choos to do business with those producers.

The

3 payments called for by the purchase of coal clause bear no
4 relationship to the amount of labor services provided to a
5 UMW signatory by its union employees.
6

The purchase of coal clause was widely understood

7 in the industry to be of doubtful legality, and many UKK
8 signa tories, including Kaiser Steel, ignored the clause.
9 Kaiser Steel complied with all of the lawful provisions in
10 its collective bargaining agreements, including those
11 provisions that required it regularly to make contributions
12 to the UhW health and welfare funds for each ton of coal
13 produced by Kaiser Steel and each hour worked by its UMW
14 employees.
15

QUESTION:

Do you contend the reporting

16 requirement was unlawful?
17

MR. MELAMED:

Yes.

The reporting requirement was

18 simply an effort to facilitate the unlawful purchase of coal
19 clause and to monitor purchases by UMW signatories of
20 non-signatories and was therefore simply an unlawful adjunct
21 to the purchase of coal clause.
22

QUESTION:

Well, is it the clause or the

23 enforcement of the clause that is unlawful?
24

MR. MELAMED:

The clause itself is unlawful.

25 is unlawful both under the --

1

QUESTION;

What if they didn't enforce it?

Would

2 there be any problem?
3

MR. MELAMED;

Well, I think it would be -- the

4 entering into the agreement and the making an agreement is
5 technically a violation of law.

I don't think anyone would

6 have any injury or any damage action as a result of merely
7 executing the contract instrument.
8

Kaiser Steel, as I said, refused to comply only

9 with the purchase of coal clause which it believed to be
10illegal.
11

The health and welfare fund trustees, the

Respondents here, for years made no effort to enforce the

12 purchase of coal clause, but in 1978, shortly after the 1974
13 agreement had expired, Respondents commenced a series of
14 lawsuits seeking to enforce the purchase of coal clause.

In

15 this case, Respondents alleged a single cause of action,
16 Kaiser Steel’s failure to comply with the purchase of coal
17 clause in the then expired 1974 agreement.

18

In defense, Kaiser Steel alleged that the purchase

19 of coal clause Respondent sought to enforce violates both
20 Section 80 of the Labor-Management Relations Act and

21 Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and is therefore
22 unenforceable and void.

Respondents moved for summary

23 judgment, arguing that they are entitled to enforce the
24 purchase of coal clause even if it is illegal.
25 court granted their motion.

The district

A divided court of appeals

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 affirmed, and by a vote of seven to four denied Kaiser
2 Steel's suggestion for rehearing en banc.
3

The decisions of the lower courts rejecting Kaiser

4 Steel's illegality defense are unprecedented.

Until this

5 case, no court had ever enforced a contract clause alleged
6 to be illegal without resolving the illegality defense on
7 the merits, and satisfying itself that the contract was
8 lawful.

Indeed, in case after case, this Court and lower

9 courts have held that federal courts do not enforce illegal
10 contract clauses, and they have so held without regard to
11 the identity of the defendant or the identity of the
12 plaintiff, even where, as here, the plaintiff is seeking
13 accrued monetary obligations and the defendant has received
14 the consideration due him under the contract.
15

QUESTION:

Mr. Melamed, what do you think the

16 effect of the 1980 amendments was?
17

ME. MELAMED:

I don't think the 1981 amendments,

18 Your Honor, have anything to do with the issue in this
19 case.

The 1981 amendments, to be sure, provide new

20 procedural vehicles and new federal causes of action for
21 pension fund trustees seeking to enforce obligations and
22 contracts for employers to make contributions to pension
23 funds, but they impose those obligations on employers only
24 in the terms of the statute to the extent not inconsistent
25 with law.

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The statute nowhere says when the making of

2 payments or contracts calling for them would be consistent
3 or inconsistent with law.
4

QUESTION;

Does the legislative history of those

5 amendments indicate that Congress was trying to put into
6 place, if you will, the Benedict case.
7

MR. MELAMED;

Well, there is no question that some

8 Congressmen spoke and praised the Lewis v. Benedict Coal
9 case, but I don’t think that addresses our issue.

The

10 Congressmen were, to be sure, concerned that dilatory tactic
11 by employers had obstructed collection actions, but every
12 time they spoke of their concerns, they spoke of defenses
13 raised by employers that were unrelated or extraneous to, in
14 their words, the employer’s promise and the plan's
15 entitlement to the contributions.
16

Now, as I hope our briefs made clear, it is the

17 law and it ought to be the law that an employer cannot
18 defend an effort to enforce a lawful contract provision on
19 the ground that other contract provisions or other
20 agreements or conduct outside the contract may be unlawful.

21 That is what Lewis v. Benedict Coal, Huge v. Long's Hauling,
22 Kelly v. Kosuga, and the other cases on which Respondents
23 rely are all about.

They are all about extraneous,

24 unrelated defenses.

That is not what this case is about.

25

In this case, Kaiser Steel's defense is that the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 very promise Respondents seek to enforce is itself illegal,
2 and that the plans are therefore not entitled to the money
3 called for by the purchase of coal clause, and that the
4 plans are therefore not entitled to the money called for by
5 the purchase of coal clause.

Therefore, even if we could

6 look beyond the statute which plainly on its terms, I think,
7 leaves unresolved and for determination in accordance with
8 the prior law, the question when contribution payments are
9 lawful and unlawful, or consistent with law and inconsistent
10 with law.

Even if we look beyond the statute, and assume

11 that it was intended to embody the remarks of these two or
12 three Congressmen, it wouldn't address the issue here,
13 because nothing that those Congressmen said or the cases to
14 which they referred said that an employer should be
15 obligated to comply with an illegal contract clause or the
16 court should enforce such contract clauses.
17

QUESTION;

Hr. Helamed, I am looking at Page 38A

18 of the appendices to the petition of Kaiser, in which the
19 dissenting opinion quotes from the majority opinion, saying

20 that, "The narrow issue on appeal therefore is not whether
21 an illegal contract clause should be enforced, but rather
22 whether Kaiser's proffered defense of illegality should be
23 entertained."

What does that mean to you?

Does that mean

24 that a defendant can set up a defense and a court can simply
25 say, we don't know or care whether it is a good defense or a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 bad defense, we simply won’t hear it?
2

MR. MELAMED;

I think that is what the majority

3 held in the Court of Appeals, Justice F.ehnquist.

It held

4 that we don't care, we are not going to examine the
5 question, we are not going to consider the impact of this
6 contract provision and its lawfulness.

I don’t understand,

7 frankly, why it is that the majority thought there might be
8a difference between that case and a case where he couldn't
9 look the other way, as it were, and had to acknowledge the
10 unlawfulness of the contract.
11

Certainly the decided cases don’t make that

12distinction, because in most of them where the illegality
13 defense has been raised and the courts have refused to
14 enforce allegedly illegal contracts, there had been no prior
15 determination of unlawfulness and the courts having the
16 allegation examined the lawfulness of the contract and then
17 made the decision whether to enforce it or not.

18
19 that.

The Court of Appeals, as I say, didn’t even do
It didn’t even examine the contract clause.

It

20 simply refused to look at it at all.

21

QUESTION;

Mr. Melamed, did your answer to Justice

22 O’Connor, did that suggest that the 1980 amendments are
23inapplicable to any decision in this case?
24

MR. MELAMED;

25 are inapplicable.

I believe that the ERISA amendments

The particular response I made to Justice

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 O’Connor was whether they resolved the question of the
2

availability of the illegality defense.

3

QUESTION;

You mean, even assuming their

4 applicabilty?
5

MR. MELAMED;

That’s right.

There is the separate

6 question of whether they would provide jurisdiction and the

7 various sanctions.
8

QUESTION;

Why do you say they are inapplicable?

9

MR. MELAMED;

I think they are inapplicable,

10

Justice Brennan, because I don't know of a case in which a

11

statute that purported to create new statutory duties was

12

imposed where the effect of that was to impose sanctions for

13 the breach of those duties on someone whose alleged breach
14 took place three years before the statute became effective.
15

QUESTION;

Of course, incidentally, the plaintiffs

16 here are really third party beneficiaries, trustees, aren't
17 they ?
18

MR. MELAMED;

19

QUESTION;

That's correct.

They are not parties to the so-called

20 illegal agreement.
21

MR. MELAMED;

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. MELAMED;

24

QUESTION;

Well, they are not the ones that --

They are third parties unofficially.
That's correct.

Judge --

And I guess the 1980 amendments, or do

25 they, if applicable, they do have a bearing on what defenses

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 are

available when the suits by the third party beneficiary,

2 stakeholder,

whatever you want to call the trustees, are

3 they not?
4

ME. MELAMED;

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. MELAMED;

I think not. Justice Brennan.

You think not?
I think even if applicable they

7 provide a cause of action, they would provide remedies and
8 sanctions available

to any plaintiff, including third party

9 beneficiaries, but for the reasons I stated to Justice
10 O’Conor,

I don’t believe they changed the availability of

11 the illegality defense.
12

QUESTION;

And that, I gather,

rests on the

13 language "not inconsistent with law"?
14

MR. MELAMED;

That's the statutory language that I

15 think preserves legal obstacles to enforcing illegal
16 contracts, and as I indicated, the legislative history, I
17 think, is not to the contrary.
18

QUESTION;

Well, what about the legislative

19 history of the 1980 amendments?
20
21 I think

MR. MELAMED;

As I have indicated. Justice White,

the legislative histories spoke in general terms of

22 the need for federal remedy,

an ERISA remedy and ERISA

23 sanctions to expedite collection actions.
24

QUESTION;

But you don't think they considered

25 cases precisely like this?

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. MELAMED;

They didn't refer to any cases

2 involving the illegality defense.

Significantly, none of

3 the Congressmen in their various statements referred to this
4 case.

The district court opinion had already been decided.

5 They did not say, we praise the district court opinion in
6 Kaiser Steel versus Mullins.

I don't know whether they

7 thought of it or whether it had been brought to their
8 attention, but they did not address a single case involving
9 the allegation that the contract provision calling for
10 contributions to the pension funds was itself illegal, void,
11 unenforceable.
12

QUESTIONS

The 1980 amendments were adopted within

13 weeks, were they not, after the decision in this case?
14

MR. MELAMED;

Yes, I believe about two weeks after

15 the court of appeals decision last fall.
16

QUESTION:

Yes.

There was no reference at all in

17 the legislative history of the 1980 amendments to the
18 pendency of this case?
19

MR. MELAKEDi

20

QUESTION;

None to my knowledge.

But they did, I gather, give a lot of

21 attention at least to Lewis and Benedict Coal in the
22 legislative history.
23

MR. MELAMED;

Well, they gave it attention insofar

24 as they said, we praise Lewis v. Benedict Coal.

They did

25 not analyze the case.

12

1

QUESTION;

2

MR. MELAMED*

3

Now, apart from the Solicitor General's suggestion

Did they address Kelly and Kosuga, too?
I don't believe so, Your Honor.

4that these new amendments to ERISA would bear upon this
5 case, the basic rationale for affirming the court of appeals
6 decision that is embodied in that decision and that
7 Respondents devote the bulk of their attention to is a
8 rationale that turns largely on the court's view of the
9 equities between the litigants.

The theories that

10 Respondents were third party beneficiaries seeking to
11 enforce a collective bargaining agreement by collecting
12 con tributions owed to health and welfare funds.

They should

13 be permitted to collect those contributions, the theory
14 goes, because the rest of the terms of the agreement have
15 been performed and Kaiser Steel has received the services of
16 its union employees.

17

This theory is fatally flawed, in our view, both

18 as a matter of equity between the litigants and as a matter
19 of law.

First, as to the equities, the critical facts

20 stressed repeatedly in Respondent's briefs in the court of
21 appeals decision is that this lawsuit was brought for
22 accrued obligations after the contract had expired and
23 Kaiser Steel had foregone its various statutory remedies.

24 Respondents would not have been able to avoid having the
25 lawfulness of the purchase of coal clause decided if

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 appropriate litigation had been commenced at the outset of
2 the contract period.
3

If Kaiser Steel or a non-UKW producer had brought

4a lawsuit seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, or had
5 gone to the NLRB in 1974, as the court of appeals evidently
6 believed it should have, or if Respondents had brought an
7 action seeking specific performance of the purchase of coal
8 clause and Kaiser Steel had raised the illegality defense,
9 or had counter claimed at that time, then Respondents'
10 ability to enforce the purchase of coal clause would have
11 depended upon its lawfulness.
12

If, as should be assumed here, it is illegal, they

13 would not then have been able to enforce the clause.
14 this has two significant implications.

Now,

For one thing, it

15 makes clear that Respondents are not entitled to enforce the
16 purchase of coal clause simply on the ground that this is a
17 collective bargaining agreement, or Kaiser Steel is an
18 employer, or Respondents were third party beneficiaries and
19 pension fund trustees.

Those facts are not enough, even on

20 the court of appeals and Respondents' theory, to entitle
21 Respondents to enforce this illegal contract clause.
22

The earlier remedies and their consequences also

23 make clear that Respondents' claim is in effect that they
24 should be better off because this lawsuit was commenced in

25 1978 than they would have been had there been litigation

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 commenced by them or by anyone else in 1974.
2

Now, a rule that Respondents could enforce the

3 clause if litigation were brought in 1978, but not if it
4 were brought in 1974, would be inequitable.

It is

5 Respondents, not Kaiser Steel, who should bear
6responsibility for any delay in litigation.

Respondents

7 chose not to bring suit to enforce the purchase of coal
8 clause earlier because it was their policy not to enforce
9 the clause.
10

As long as Respondents continued to adhere to that

11 policy, there was no reason for Kaiser Steel to run into
12 court and bring needless, speculative litigation challenging
13 the lawfulness of the purchase of coal clause, and only
14 Respondents, of course, knew whether they were going to
15 abandon their policy.
16

So, if anyone should bear the burden of delay in

17 the commencement of this litigation, it is Respondents, and

18 surely they should not be entitled to turn that delay into
19 an excuse for having new legal rules that would make them
20 better off than they would have been had there been

21 litigation about the lawfulness of this clause at the outset
22 of the contract periods.

23

Moreover, a rule that challenges to the illegality

24 of contract provisions are waived if not raised promptly
25 would trigger premature and often unnecessary lawsuits by a

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 party seeking anticipatory relief from illegal contracts
2 It would cause parties fearful of losing their rights to
3

rush to federal court to bring actions, to rush to the NLRB,

4

and to commence litigation where forebearance might, as had

5

been the pattern in this industry, have avoided litigation

6 alt ogether.

In any event, regardless of these considerations,

7

8 the court of appeals decision is erroneous as a matter of
9

law.

Both the court of appeals and Respondents recognize

10

that a court cannot be asked to enforce illegal conduct.

11

But, they argue, Kaiser Steel had refused to participate in

12

the illegal boycott and now all that is at stake is the

13

transfer of money from Kaiser Steel to the Respondents.

14

The gist of their argument is this.

A court

15

should not enforce the illegal purchase of coal clause where

16

the effect might be to induce a boycott of non-UMW producers

17

and thereby injure those producers, but Kaiser Steel may

18

nevertheless be held responsible to pay penalties and

19

damages for its failure to participate in precisely that

20 unlawful boycott.

There are two basic flaws in this theory.

21

First,

22 it rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of both Section
23

80 of the Labor-Management Relations Act and the antitrust

24

laws.

25

have it, solely to protect non-UMW producers from illegal

Those statutes are not intended, as this theory would

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 boycotts.

In the National Woodwork case# this Court held

2 that the primary purpose of Section 80 is to protect
3 employers like Kaiser Steel from being harmed by hot cargo
4 clauses like the purchase of coal clause or by damage
5 actions brought to enforce them.

That is precisely what

6 this case is all about.
7

The antitrust laws, too, are intended to protect

8 the freedom of companies like Kaiser Steel to do business
9 with whomever they wish without being penalized for doing
10 so.

Therefore, if the purchase of coal clause violates

11 Section 80, or the antitrust laws, then Kaiser Steel as well
12 as non-UNW producers is entitled to invoke the protections
13 of those laws, and as Justice Stewart said in his dissent in
14 the Connell case, and as Senator Goldwater said in his
15 remarks about Section 80, Kaiser Steel is entitled simply to
16 ignore and to refuse to comply with the illegal hot cargo
17 clause.
18

Second, Respondents' theory cannot be reconciled

19 with the case law.

In case after case, which we have

20discussed in our briefs, the courts have held that a
21 defendant may raise the illegality defense in an action
22 brought to enforce an illegal contract clause, even where
23 the plaintiff is seeking only to recover accrued
24 obiigations, and regardless whether the payment of money
25 would itself or in and of itself be illegal conduct.

No

deal with that.
I don’t think it does.

at that is to bear in mind Respondents'

24 relief or injunctive relief.
25 but

That is a sound concession,

it concedes really that what is at issue here is whether

is a threshold question whether Respondents are entitled

whether courts should lend their aid to

4

Now, let's go back to Lewis v. Benedict Coal.

If

5 the employer there had anticipated the strike that he was
6 upset about, gone into court to seek some kind of injunctive
7 or declaratory relief against the union, complaining of its
8 strike,

no one would suggest that he could have joined the

9 pension fund trustees as defendants.

The issue there truly

10 was collateral.
11

The issue there was whether because the employer

12 felt he was owed some money by the union, he could use that
13 as a set-off against money he clearly owned under a valid
14 and lawful provision against the pension fund trustees.
15 That is a very different case, Your Honor, because it
16 doesn't raise the threshold question, which is, is there a
17 valid instrument here.

Are they entitled to the money?

And

18 should a court lend its aid to a contract provision that
19 Congress has declared

20

to be unenforceable and void?

The cases that we have cited reflect the important

21 policies that underlie the rule that courts do not enforce
22 illegal contract clauses,

all of which apply here.

The rule

23 against enforcing illegal agreements preserves the role of
24 federal

courts as enforcers of the law.

Penalizing Kaiser Steel for its purchases of coal

2 from a non-UMW producer would cause an injury that both the
3 labor laws and the antitrust laws are intended to prevent,
4 and enforcing the purchase of coal clause in this case would
5 encourage other parties to include illegal contract
6 provisions in future agreements and to carry out their
7 illegal terms.d

QUESTION:

Hell, would freeing Kaiser of the

9 obligation to make these payments mean that the pension fund
10 would have to, in order to be solvent, or to do what, it was
11 supposed to do, have to collect higher -12

MR. MELAMED:

I think not. Justice White.

The

13 purchase of coal clause was not intended to fund the pension
14 funds.

Their financial plans did not depend on it.

15 those facts may be disputed.

Now,

We have affidavits in support

16 of them, and on this appeal from summary judgment we are
17 entitled to have them presumed.
18

If we had complied with the clause and done what

19 the union wanted, we would have boycotted Midcontinent Coal
20 Company, we wouldn't have incurred any obligations under the

21 purchase of coal clause, and the Respondents wouldn't have
22 gotten any payments at all.
23

QUESTION:

So you think at least we should judge

24 this case on the grounds that this required payment was not
25 deemed to be part of the actuarial soundness of the plan.

in the 1979 committee print of the Senate on S. 209, at Page

2 UU,

and this statute had the meaning which we contend it has

3

from the time of the report of the Senate Committee on the

4

1979 bill in November, 1979, through the floor debates in

5

which the sponsors of the legislation stated it clearly.

6

QUESTION;

What of Mr. Melamed's argument that in

7

any event the 1980 statute was not adopted until weeks after

8

the decision in this case below, and therefore it is

9

inapplicable ?

10

MR. POLLAK;

Well, the 1980 statute was adopted on

11

September 26th, nine days after the court of appeals

12

opinion, and we contend --

13

QUESTION;

It was only nine days?

14

MR. POLLAK;

Nine days. Your Honor, and we contend

15

that on this court's landmark decision reviewing the

16

jurisprudence, Bradley versus Richmond, that the statute

17

clearly is intended to apply to pending cases.

18

that a statute or a court applies the law in effect on the

19

time of its decision unless either the statutory language

20

itself or the legislative history or a manifest injustice

21

looks the other way.

22

The rule is

Now, we contend here that looking at Bradley, that

23

this case fits precisely within those rubrics, and we would

24

also contend, Mr. Justice, that the language which Congress

25

adopted statutorily in Section 306(A) says, whoever is

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

It is obligated to

QUESTION;

Nr. Poliak --

6

QUESTION;

Go ahead.

7

QUESTION;

Can't we really examine, though,

8 whether the 1980 amendments impose new and anticipated
9 obligations on Kaiser, and therefore we wouldn't apply those
10 amendments? That is a concern, and I would like you to
11 address yourself to that.
12

MR. POLLAK;

13 Justice.

The statute does not impose new and unanticipated

14 obligat ions.

I would be pleased to do that, Madame

Indeed, in the legislative history at several

15 points the sponsors as well as the committee print states
16 the statute clarifies existing law, and also the Bradley
17 decision would, we believe, make clear that the obligation
18 that is being discussed here is the obligation provided by
19 the collective bargaining agreement which always existed.
20 There is no vested right in Kaiser to plead an illegality
21 defense, a pleading by a party that claims it participated
22 as a signer of an unlawful contract.
23

That pleading of the illegality is only permitted

24 when it serves a public purpose, and the public purpose
25 clearly is arbitrated by the United States Congress.

The

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 United States Congress said that there is no public purpose
2 in being able to plead an illegality defense of this nature
3 to a claim of trustees for contributions required by a
4 collective bargaining agreement.
5

So, in brief, we believe there is no new or

6 unanticipated obligation, and secondly, there is no vested
7 right that Kaiser possessed to plead this defense.

Indeed,

8 there is in the McNair versus Knott decision of the Supreme
9 Court a very pertinent holding which said that a party to an
10 unlawful contract has no right to plead the illegality, and
11 Congress may change it during the pendency of the contract
12 or after, and the plea may not be raised.
13

QUESTION:

Is that something of a reflection of

14 the doctrine of in pari delicto?
15

MR. POLLAK:

Well, there is no in pari delicto of

16 the trustees, Mr. Chief Justice, and one of the --

FOLLAK:

Kell, we suggest, Mr. Chief Justice,

our second ground being Benedict, and a third

5 ground,

independent of the other two, being the Kelly v.

6 Kosuga decision of

this Court in 1959, and the exclusive

7 jurisdiction of the NLRB under Garner and Garvin over unfair
8 labor practice matters, and
9 Kosuga,

there were considerations there that the pension

10 trustees,

not in Kosuga, but in Benedict, that the pension

11 trustees should
12 and

in Benedict and in Kelly v.

not be precluded by employer-union disputes,

we do consider that that motivated the United States

13 Congress in

passing the

QUESTIONS

So you are saying that what Congress

2 really did is to amend the labor law and the antitrust law
3 in the 1980 Act by saying that -- of course, we know that
4 hot cargo clauses are illegal, but if an employer has put
5 one in the contract and agreed to it, he nevertheless has to
6 honor it?
7

Is that it?
MR. POLLAK;

We are saying essentially that

8 Congress had a concern for multi-employer pension plans, and
9 it wished disputes between unions and employers to be
10 thrashed out between them.

Well, it has been thrashed out before

12 the labor board, betweent the union and the employer -13

MR. POLLAK;

No, it would not -- it would not be a

MR. POLLAK;

QUESTION;

Hell, the You say, because Congress has now told

4 it not to.
5

MR.

POLLAK; We think the -- particularly after

a

6 ruling of that nature, the employer would be justified in
7 rejecting

the proposed clause asked for by the union, and

8 the union struck,

if

the employer could sue for damages under

9 Sec tion 303 .
10

QUESTION;

But the existing contract he must abide

11 by until it expires?
12

MR.

POLLAK; Well, the existing contract that is

13 in front of the court is a contract that began in
14 concluded in

1974 and

1977, so the facts don’t present, but if he was

15 in the middle of a contract, we feel constrained by what we
16 read to have been done by the Congress, that the remedies
17 would be against the union, not against the trust.

QUESTION;

Do I understand, Mr. Poliak,

that the

19 current contract does not have this purchase clause in it?
20

MR.

These are contracts for three year terms, Hr.

QUESTION;

So they have all had this purchase of

ME. POLLAK;

Since 1974, a clause in this

employers to pay a royalty on each ton of coal handled,

8

whether produced or purchased, and that clause continues in

the contract today.

Now, the -- I want to say a word about Bradley

which, in addition to the 1980 Act, we believe, is an

independent ground for the decision, and I would add that

13

the Congress, the sponsors, both sponsors of the 1980 Act

14

and the floor debates in support of their statement that

15

they were only clarifying the law, cited the Benedict case,

16

cited the Long's Hauling Third Circuit case, and cited a

if the employer purchases coal, it

QUESTION*

Their benefits are measured by their

2 period of service, and —
3

HR. POLLAK;

4

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

The liability --

-- the company has paid into the fund

5 for all of their service, so that if they buy outside, that
6 doesn't increase the liabilities to them.

If they pay on

7 that coal, it increases the assets of the fund, but without
8 any corresponding increase in liabilities.
9

HR. POLLAK;

The liabilities of the fund continue,

10 and the concern of those who manage the fund and the union
11 is to have funding provisions in the collective bargaining.
12

QUESTION;

But basically the funding is computed,

13 is it not, on the basis of how many hours worked on the
14 tonnage on which royalties have been paid.

That is the

15 basic measure of the actuarial soundness of the plan, isn't
16 it?
17

MR. POLLAK;

No, the basic actuarial measure, as

18Mr. Melamed said, is apparently disputed, but there is no
19 dispute that the provisions that are in the contract call
20 for the same royalty on each ton --

QUESTION;

I want to say a word on the independent grounds,

That case, which is urged to be a case in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA E. ETKIND, ESQ.,

18

AMICUS CURIAE

19

MS. ETKIND;

Ms. Ekind?

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

20 it please the Court, but enacting the Multi-Employer Pension
21 Plan Amendments Act of 1980, and particularly Section 306(A)
22 of it, Congress expressed its overriding concern for the
23 economic soundness of multi-employer pension and welfare
24 plans.

It is our position that in doing so. Congress made

25 the policy decision to accord a higher priority to

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 curtailing interference with the collection of prescribed
2 contributions than to incrementally furthering the ends of
3 the antitrust and labor laws by one particular means, that
4 of permitting contracting parties to defend against suits
5 brought to enforce their contract on the ground of those
6 contracts' illegality under the antitrust or labor laws.
7

Under the amendments, if payments are due a

8 contract -- are due under a contract to a fund, those
9 payments are protected without any need to look beyond the
10 contract to see whether the fund really depends on a payment
11 of those contributions.

12

That is all part of the fluctuating Congress’s

13 intent of facilitating the collection of contributions due
14 these funds, and not cluttering up the collection process
15 with other issues.

16

QUESTION.’

What about the language "unless

17 otherwise contrary to law"?

18

MS. ETKIND;

Well, we believe that that language

19 does take a gloss from the legislative history.

In both

20 Houses of Congress, the floor managers of the bill that was

21 to become the 1980 amendments delivered carefully prepared
22 and coordinated statements that were drawn largely from a
23 committee print that explicitly purported to represent the
24 views of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
25 The statements decried the fact that simple collection

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 actions brought by plan trustees had been converted into
2 lengthy, costly, and complex litigation concerning claims
3 and defenses unrelated to the employer's promise and the
4 plan's entitlement to the contribution.
5

QUESTION;

But we are faced with an enacted

6 statutory clause here, which I would assume would take
7 precedence over committee prints or floor debate.
8

NS. ETKIND;

Of course, that is right, but the

9 legislators zeroed in on a specific standard which sheds
10 light on the meaning of that specific statutory language.
11 The standard they zeroed in on was that "Federal pension law
12 must permit trustees of plans to recover delinquent
13 contributions efficiaciously and without regard to issues
14 which might arise under labor-management relations law other
15 than 29 USC 186."
16

Now, it is our contention that Congress's explicit

17 intent to protect the financial integrity of multi-employer
18 pension plan funds by insulating them from defenses other
19 than those based on Section

186 sheds substantial light on

20 the meaning of Section 306(A) of the amendments.

21

QUESTION;

Would you also take the position that

22 Nr. Poliak did that even if the NLRB had determined during

23 the course of a contract that the purchase of coal clause is
24 illegal, that nevertheless the trustees would be entitled to
25 collect those payments under that illegal provision?

23

MS. ETKIND;

Because I believe that by the

24 statutory language of 306 (A), that implicitly repealed the
25 unenforceable and void language of Section 8(E).

The gloss

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that I think the legislative history brings to the language
2 of Section 306(A) is that the legislative history refers to
329 USC 186 as the only possible defense.

Now, the

4 outstanding feature of 186 is that it declares unlawful the
5 very making of a payment itself.

That is, the simple

6 passage of money from an employer to a representative of its
7 employees, except in very narrowly circumscribed situations,
8 and similarly. Section 306(A) can be construed, and we
9 submit in view of Congress's policy of curtailing
10 interference with the collection of contractually prescribed
11 contributions should be construed so as to eliminate all
12 defenses to collection actions for delinquent contributions
13 except those based on unlawfulness in the very making of the
14 contribution itself.
15

The lanquage of Section 306(A) easily bears this

16 reading of it, since Congress inserted the words "to the
17 extent not inconsistent with law", so as to modify the verb
18 phrase,

"every employer shall make such contributions".

23

There remains one matter that I did not have an

24 opportunity to address in my opening remarks, and that is
25 the lower court's holding that the district court did not

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 even have jurisdiction to decide whether the purchase of
2 coal clausa is an illegal hot cargo clause.

Now, this

3 matter has been discussed at length in our brief.
4

In essence, our position is as follows.

Section

5 80 of the Labor Management Relations Act provides without
6 qualification that all hot cargo clauses are unenforceable
7 and void.

There is nothing in the legislative history of

8 that section or in any other legal authority of which we are
9 aware to suggest that Congress meant something different
10 from that, that Congress meant that only some hot cargo
11 clauses are unenforceable and void.
12

Certainly there is nothing in that statute or in

13 the new statute to suggest that Congress might have
14 intended, as the Solicitor General suggested, that the NLRB
15 would be powerless even when it found a hot cargo clause to
16 enjoin its continued compliance or to issue a cease and
17 desist order.
18

Moreover, there is ample authority for the

19 proposition that courts have inherent authority to decide
20 whether contract clauses they are asked to enforce are
21 lawful and that federal courts may decide labor law issues
22 in cases where they arise, in cases in which they arise that
23 are properly before the court on other grounds.
24

It is simply unthinkable that a federal court

25 should be required to enforce a contract without even having

50
