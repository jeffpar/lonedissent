ORAL ARGUHENT OF KENNETH 0. EIKENBERRY, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

MR. EIKENBERRYi

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court, 65 years before this Court rejected
10 the concept of separate but equal facilities for
11 schools, the people of the state of Washington adopted a
12 constitution which declared it to be the paramount duty
13 of the state to provide for public school education
14 without distinction based on race, color, caste, or sex.
15

Consistent with that constitutional mandate,

16 no Washington school district has ever been held to have
17 operated a de jure segregated school system, and
18 throughout the history of the state, the policy of local
19 school districts has been to assign students to their
20 neighborhood schools.
21

In 1977, however, the Seattle School District

22 started a massive busing program which was not required
23 by either the state or federal Constitution.

Seattle’s

24 program effectively wiped out the traditional
25 neighborhood school assignment policy in that city.

It

3

1

was in this context that the Washington voters in the

2 following year enacted a law which was the subject of
3 this appeal.

Subject to the requirements of the

4 Constitution, this law limits the ability of local
5 school districts to require any

public school student to

6 attend a school other than that

which is nearest or next

7 nearest to the student place of residence.
8

Recognizing constitutional imperatives, then,

9 the Washington voters gave the legitimate policy of
10 neighborhood school assignment the higher priority than
11

the policy of racial balancing in public schools.

The

12 question before this Court is whether the state and its

13 voters can restrict the exercise of authority by school
14 districts which are creatures of the state.
15

The Washington state law defines basic

16 education, determines the content,

provides the funding,

17 provides average salary levels for school district
18 staffs, provide staff-student ratios, specifies the
19 number of hours that a teacher must spend in the
20 classroom, makes available funding for district
21 transportation, and prescribes a number of other matters

22 relating to educational curriculum and staffing.
23

Washington law also provides for interdistrict

24 voluntary transfer programs to improve racial balance
25 and state planning to assist school districts in

4

developing programs to relief racial isolation.

State

2 administrative law conditions construction grants on a
3

determination by the superintendent of public

4

instruction that the proposed construction would not

5

create or aggravate racial balance within the districts.

6
7

In short, the legislature and the state of
Washington is a super school board.

8 simply follow state policy.

Local school boards

The legislature and the

9 voters, through the democratic initiative process and
10

the ultimate source of authority for school — are the

11

source of authority source of authority for school

12

districts .
The voters of our state chose to restrict the

13
14

authority of school districts so as to preserve the

15

historical practice of assigning students to nearby

16

schools.

17

of this Court indicate the importance of neighborhood

18

schools for children and their parents, be they of

19

minority or non-minority race, and the district court so

The record in this case and previous opinions

20 found .
21

Such benefits include, for example, increased

22 community support of input, enhanced safety, reduced
23

cost, and improved home-school relations, and in this

24

respect, I cannot improve on Justice Powell's discussion

25

in the Keyes case.

In contrast, assignment and

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

transportation of students beyond a nearby school will

2 minimize such benefit both to minority and non-minority

3 students.
4

This policy of nearby schools was approved by

5 a statewide electorate and enacted into law because the
6

people believed that it was the best for all the school

7 children in our state.

It is a policy that by its own

8 terms and by an interpretation which I have pledged the

9 Office of Attorney General may not be used to thwart any
10 plan to cure de jure segregation or any plan to correct
11

a dual school system.

AFTERNOON SESSION

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Attorney General,

3 you may continue.
4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH 0. EIKENBERRY, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - CONTINUED

6

MR. EIKENBERRY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Court, if this Court upholds the validity of
8 the initiative, what will not happen and what will
9 happen?

First, such a ruling will not sanction

10 discrimination in Washington schools.

It will not

11 signify a retreat by this Court from the Constitutional
12 prohibition against de jure segregation or a dual school
13 system, and it will not cause the Seattle District to
14 revert to a segregated system, because that system has
15 never been segregated.
16

If this Court upholds the validity of

17 Initiative 350, there will be at least eight school
18 districts having five or more schools with minority
19 enrollments in excess of the statewide average which
20 will not change student assignments at all, and this is
21 because these schools are already balanced on a school
22 by school basis through application of Washington’s
23 traditional neigborhood school policy.
24

Further, if this Court upholds the validity of

25 the Initiative, there will be one Appellee school

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

district that will not change its assignment pattern,

2 and two school districts that must.

3

The Tacoma School District will continue to

4 use a voluntary and magnet school system to achieve
5 racial basis balancing in its schools, with no real
6 changes in student assignments.

The Pasco School

7 District will have to stop mandatory busing of minority
8 children only to distant parts of the Pasco school

9 district.

This will prompt a fairer approach to

10 addressing racial balance, one that does not fall on
11
12

minority children only.
The Seattle School District will have to stop

13 the mandatory busing of wholesale numbers of children,
14 both minority and non-ninority, from one end of the
15 district to the other unless there is a Constitutional
16 reason to do so.
17

The matter of racial busing and distribution

18 in the schools will be steadily and affirmatively
19 affected by demographic changes in the district.

I

20 invite your review of the charts prepared by the Seattle
21

School District which reflect the dispersal of minority

22 student residences throughout the district.

Comparing

23 the charts of 1976 with current trends will show how the
24 residences and minority students are becoming more and
•

25 more dispersed over the entire city.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Further, the Seattle School District will be

2 subject to state policies which will encourage the

3 district to use all available techniques to address
4 racial balance in student assignments.
5

Two judges on the court of appeals and the

6 district court judge have concluded

that the policy of

7 nearby schools must be struck down on the theory that it
8 amounts to an impermissible legislative classification

9 based on racial criteria, and the court relies on Hunter
10 against Erickson and Lee versus Nyquist.
11

We urge this

Court's critical review of the lower court holding as

12 being unsound.

13

In applying Initiative 350 to actual practice,

14 we see there is a classification as between students who
15 qualify for mandatory assignment to a distant school for
16 one set of reasons versus students who do not qualify.
17 The set of reasons which qualify for mandatory distant
18 assignment are health, safety, special education
19 requirements, or because of unfit or inadequate
20 con ditions.

21

These are not imposed along racial lines.

22 Conversely,

one can readily identify reasons being

23 asserted by the school district or that might be
24 asserted otherwise for mandatory distant student
25 assignments which do not qualify under the terms of the

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Initiative, such as filling up classrooms at the

2 opposite end of the disrict, accommodating teaching

3 staff, obtaining more transportation funding from the
4 state, balancing of classroom size, or adjusting racial
5 balance to a declared standard.
And the fact that the initiative is silent on

6

7 such asserted reasons for distant student assignments
8 and therefore does not qualify them does not provide the

9 basis for a court to infer there is a class which is
10 racial in nature.

11

As Judge Wright in the Ninth Circuit

pointed out in his dissent, the Initiative is a neutral

12 law that must be analyzed in terms of its content.

13
14 races, and

Initiative 350 is benign in its treatment of
is clearly distinguishable from the kind of

15 law that was struck down in Hunter against Erickson.
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, aside from

17 this one, Number 350, has a statewide initiative ever
18 been used in the state of Washington to modify local
19 school board decisions?
20

MR. EIKENBERRY;

Not to modify local school

21 board decisions, Your Honor, but the use of the
22 initiative is so commonplace that it ranges from

23 authorizing the coloring of oleomargerine, which I
24 recall as a youngster, to most recently a statewide
25 initiative to control the expenditure of funds for power

QUESTION*

8 here did find that

Let me ask you one more question.

Am I correct, the district court
the initiative was enacted for the

9 sole purpose of preventing

10 desegregation?
11

Yes.

busing for racial

Is that correct?

MR. EIKENBERRY*

The court concluded, I

12 believe, Your Honor, that it was in response to the
13 Seattle plan.

Yes, sir.

14

QUESTION*

15

MR. EIKENBERRY*

16 agree that

Do you dispute that?
No, Your Honor.

We certainly

the Seattle plan is what galvanized the

17 action that

sparked the initiative, but we certainly

18 indicate that statewide there would

have been other

19 reasoning on the part of the voters and additional

20 reasons for

passing the initiative.

21

QUESTION*

22 balance.

From what source does that standard derive?

23 What is the
24

You have spoken of a racial

balance that was sought to be achieved?

MR. EIKENBERRY*

Your Honor, this is a varying

25 term, and it is critical to the decision in

the case,

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

because the racial balance that is intended by the

2 Seattle School District when they speak is the formula
3 that they use,

which can be a moving target, depending

4 on the demographic changes in the district from year to
5 year.

The court, the district court apparently had a

6 slightly different

thought in mind in its findings when

7 it talked about racial balance.

QUESTIONi

8

Well, in your answer to Justice

9 Blackmun, I had the feeling that you, well, at least you
10 didn't answer that opposition to racial balance is not
11

equivalent to a discriminatory racial purpose.

It

12 isn’t, is it?

MR. EIKENBERRYi

13

Oh, I am sorry, Your Honor.

14 I misspoke if I — in leaving that impression, because
15 do not believe and

I

I think the evidence in the record

16 suggests that it was not opposition to racial balance --

QUESTION*

17

Well, even if it was opposition to

18 racial balance, is that equivalent to a discriminatory
19 racial purpose,
20 balancing?

22 Honor.

if you say, I am against voluntary

Is that —
MR. EIKENBERRYi

Oh, no, it is not, Your

I believe under the decisions of this Court,

23 that it would not be.
24

QUESTION:

25 that the initiative

Well, did the district court find
was animated by discriminatory

racial purpose, or only as an opposition to racial

2 balance?

MR. EIKENBERRYs

The court, the district court

that there was — that that was a

5 motivating intent.
6

QUESTIONS

Which was?

7

MR. EIKENBERRYs

Which was?

That there was an intent —

8 As I was saying, yes. Your Honor, it was concluded that
9 that purpose

was a — one of the factors.

10

QUESTIONS

11

MR. EIKENBERRYs

12 important,

What purpose?
All right, and that is

Your Honor, because we are suggesting that

13 the purpose

that the court described, the district

14 court, was not a significant factor.
15 initiative invalid

To hold the

on this basis is like holding a law

16 conscripting clerics invalid because an athiest voted
17 for it —
18

QUESTION;

How did he describe the purpose,

19 though, that he —

20

MR. EIKENBERRYs

The purpose that the district

21 court, Your Honor, had in mind, we believe, reading the

22 memorandum opinion and the findings there,
23 was to contradict or rescind the

the purpose

Seattle plan.

That is

24 what he picks out.
25

QUESTION;

Well, what do you make of the

1

district court's finding in his conclusions of law at

2 Page A-26 of the jurisdictional statement, Conclusion

3 3-2, that a racially discriminatory intent or purpose
4

was one of the factors which motivated the adoption of

5

the initiative?
HR. EIKENBERRY;

6
7

All right.

Your Honor, it is

true that that is certainly what the court has found.

8 That is a conclusion recited by the court, and that —

9 the court had in mind nothing more than the fact that
10

the initiative rescinded the Seattle school plan.
QUESTION;

11
12

But the court of appeals didn't

review that finding, did it?

13

MR. EIKENBERRY;

MR. EIKENBERRY;

What effect does that have on us?
Well, Justice Marshal, it is

17

It isn't important?

MR. EIKENB'ERRY;

18
19

No, Your Honor.

It is important to

distinguish between the kind of so-called discriminatory

It had

different kinds of

MR. EIKENBERRY;

1

No, Your Honor, I don't mean

2 to imply that at all.

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. EIKENBERRY;

Well, what do you mean?
I am suggesting that the use

5 of the term "discriminatory intent" is inappropriate, an
6 inappropriate label here, because what the court has in

7 mind is rescinding the Seattle plan, and it is ironic

not said that?

That is certainly correct,

Your Honor, and as recently as the Spangler decision, a

8 California case, has been an instance of changing

11

demographic circumstances where the Court found it
wasn't necessary to keep adjusting and make adjustments.
QUESTION;

Well, apart from keeping

adjustments, is there any Constitutional requirement to

But that's not what the judge

He said it was for the purpose of destroying the

7 Seattle plan.

That's what the judge found.

MR. EIKENBERRY;

8

Correct, Your Honor, and

9 we’re saying that the voters of

the state of Washington

10 made a more discreet choice in accommodating the
11

benefits of neighborhood schools with achieving racially

12 diverse

student bodies.
QUESTION;

13

14 If it is so

Well, why is the city objecting?

much of a failure to the city, why is the

15 city objecting?

MR. EIKENBERRY;

16

17 Your Honor,

Perhaps private authorship.

but the point is that testimony from one of

18 the Seattle superintendents,

such as Dr. Moberly,

19 indicated they were proceeding with
20 which
21

a voluntary plan

they had started out with, and we submit, given

time, using other techniques could have achieved racial

22 balance appropriately.
23

QUESTION;

24 to — well,

Well, what your argument comes down

I will ask you.

Does it come down to this

that a school district can’t have a policy

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 or a program which is in conflict with the overall state
2 mandate?

Is that your argument?

3

MB. EIKENBE.RRY:

That's correct. Your Honor,

4 that it is the prerogative of the state legislature to
5 set policy in this area as it is done in so many
6 others.

The initiative we believe is benign in its

7 treatment of races, and is clearly distinguishable from
8 the kind of law that was struck down in Hunter against
9 Erickson.
10

In that case, a city charter amendment had

11 placed a special voting burden on any ordinance dealing
12 with racial, religious, or ancestral discriminate
13 ordinances in housing.
14 not a school case.

The Hunter case, of course, is

Nevertheless, on its face, we

15 submit, it does provide an example of an explicit
16 impermissible classification and, by contrast,
17 demonstrates why Initiative 350 is valid, and the Ninth
18 Circuit Court effectively acknowledged that Initiative
19 350 does not create an explicit classification based on
20 race, but nevertheless hold that it implicitly creates
21 this classification.

Why would one be more of a racial

2 classification than the other, the statute we’ve got as

4

MR. EIKENBERRYi

Well, let tne answer Your

5 Honor, I believe as your hypothetical applies to our
6 case it is critical that it be voluntary, because we
7 don’t want a situation where the neighborhood population
8 would be frozen in place.

We need to have the ability

QUESTION*

Well, why do you need that?

It

12 seems to me that the state interest in having the
13 children go to the neighborhood school might well be
14 paramount, as it is here.

MR. EIKENBERRYi

QUESTION:

But, see, as to the question

2 statute to -- against — act against one race or
3 another, then we would be finding that there was a
4 discriminatory intent, perhaps a classification that
5 would make the statute unconstitutional.
6

QUESTION:

The difference is not then in terms

7 of whether one is a racial classification and the other
8 is not, but rather, whether one supports an inference of
9 racial intent and the other does not.

That is your

10 difference.
11

MR. EIKENBERRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's

12 correct, sir.
13

QUESTION:

But you would say they should be

14 judged equally on the question of whether they create a
15 racial classification.
16

MR. EIKENBERRY;

Yes.

That's correct, Your

17 Honor.
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, Initiative

19 350 doesn't purport to limit the power of any court,
20 federal or state, to direct busing in connection with a
21 desegregation plan, does it?
22

MR. EIKEN3ERRY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. EIKENBERRY:

25

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, it does not.

The courts remain free.
Absolutely.

While I have interrupted you, would

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

it be permissible under the law in your state for all

2 school boards to be abolished and the power they now

3 exercise to be vested, say, in the Secretary of
4 Education, or perhaps a state commission?
5

MR. EIKENBERRY:

Yes, sir, that could have

6 been a choice exercised by the legislature when it

7 initially created a school system pursuant to the
8 constitution to have a completely different

9 administrative structure than it has today.
10 being a racial classification,

Instead of

the legislative

11 classification created by Initiative 350, we believe, is
12 analogous to the classification

at issue in Personnel

13 Administrator of Massachusetts against Feeney.
14

In that case, this Court rejected the argument

15 that a Massachusetts statute created -- creating an
16 absolute lifetime employment preference to veterans,
17 classified persons on the basis of sex.

This Court

18 noted that while the statute excluded significant
19 numbers of women from preferred state jobs, it could not
20 plausibly be explained only as a gender-based
21 classification.

Veteran status is not uniquely male,

22 just as opposition to busing is not uniquely a white

23 majority view, nor is support of busing exclusively a
24 minority point of view.
25

And with regard to the case now before the

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Court, it must be said that adoption of the nearby
2 school policy cannot be explained solely on racial
3 grounds.

Preference for nearby schools is not limited

4 to the racial majority, and preference for mandatory
5 busing to achieve racial balance is not limited to
6 racial minorities.

To the contrary, significant numbers

7 of both classes lie on either side of the busing
8 controversy.
9

Even though there is not an explicit

10 classification based on race contained in the
11 initiative, it is relevant to consider the question of
12 whether there is an intent to discriminate, as has been
13 suggested.

And that case, we believe, is controlled by

14 the case of Washington against Davis.

In short, the

15 voters in the state of Washington have struck an
16 accommodation.

The question before this Court is

17 whether in striking that accommodation our state may
18 limit the authority of its local school districts, which
19 are agents of the state itself, to require conduct which
20 is otherwise constitutionally permissible.
21

In our view, it may certainly do so.

In

22 Washington, the legislature defines basic education and
23 determines its content.
24 its funding.

The legislature then provides

It also prescribes salary levels for

25 school district employees, and even dictates the amount

The

2 legislature in Washington is a super school board.
3 Local school boards simply follow state educational
4 policy.
5

The legislature in our state has made an

6 additional policy choice in the field of education, one
7 which by its own terms may never be used to thwart any
8 attempt to cure de jure segregation should that occur in
9 Washington State.
10

QUESTION:

General Eikenberry, the Solicitor

11 General's brief, as I read it, says that even a law
12 which is racially neutral on its face may violate the
13 equal protection clause if it causes a
14 disproportionately adverse impact on a racial minority
15 that can be traced to purposeful discrimination.

We

16 have in place here, I suppose, a factual determination
17 by the trial court that at least there was some
18 purposeful or intentional discrimination.
19

Do you agree with the Solicitor General's

20 statement that I just read to you?
21

MR. EIKENBERRY:

We agree, Your Honor, that it

22 could be, but would vary from the Court's -- from Your
23 Honor's reading of the district court's opinion and
24 order that there were not technically findings.

There

25 was a conclusion which I believe is dependent purely on

the matter of rescinding the Seattle school plan.

2

QUESTIONi

Okay, so you would propose that

3 there is no factual finding of an intent to
4 discriminate.
5

HR. EIKENBERRY:

6

QUESTIONi

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Do you believe that there is a

7 disproportionately adverse impact, as this Court has
8 defined how we look at that?

9

HR. EIKENBERRY:

No, absolutely, Your Honor,

10 we do not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HOGE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HOGE:

20 one he wishes he had.

11

Do you agree with the Attorney

General's proposition that the state's authority

12 supersedes all the local authority of the local school
13

boards?
MR. HOGEs

14

We believe — we agree with that

15

proposition as a general matter.

Certainly, the state

16

is entirely free to structure its political processes in

17

just about any way it chooses to do so, except in a way

18

that violates the equal protection clause by

19

establishing a racial classification or by adopting a

20 statute at least in part because of discriminatory
21

intent.

22

Both courts were correct --

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Hoge, before you go ahead,

24

absent de jure segregation, is there any legal duty at

25

all to order busing?

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ROGEs

Under the Federal Constitution,

2 there is not a constitutional duty to require busing —
3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MR. HOGE:

-- in the absence of de jure

5 segregation.

However, the record in this case shows

6 that the Seattle school board had a good faith belief
7 that their failure to take action to desegregate the

8 schools in response to threats of litigation over

9 desegregation would necessarily involve them in federal
10 court control and
11

running of the school system.

That

decision was made only after 15 years of unsuccessful

12 efforts to desegregate the schools by all possible
3 voluntary means.
4

QUESTION;

Has there ever been any finding of

5 de jure violation in the state of Washington?
6

MR. HOGE;

As applied to a school system and

7 its student assignment policies —
8

QUESTION;

Yes.

9

MR. HOGE:

— no.

20

QUESTION;

Yes.

21

MR. HOGE;

Nevertheless, this statute at issue

22 in this case establishes a racial classification, as
23 both courts below found, that is in no material respect
24 any different from those in Hunter versus Erickson and
25 Lee versus Nyquist.

The initiative was designed to and

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

does prohibit assignments beyond nearby schools only in

2 the case of racial desegregation.

It permits all the

3 traditional assignments away from nearby schools that
4 went on in the state of Washington before the initiative
5 was adopted.

And further, as this Court knows from its

6 own experience. Section 3 of the initiative,

which

7 prohibits school districts indirectly from violating the
8 nearest or next nearest school rule is simply a list of

9 the common desegregation techniques which the federal
10 courts of this country have ordered for
11

30 years.

In short, race is written all over the face of

12 Initiative 350, even though the word "race" and the word

13 "desegregation" never appear by design.

This Court,

14 however, need not decide whether the presumption of
15 unconstitutional purpose which arises with a racial
16 classification invalidates the statute in this case,
17 because plaintiffs established at trial, the trial court
18 found on the basis of much evidence, that a
19 discriminatory purpose was a factor in the adoption of
20 Initiative 350.
21

QUESTION*

But the court of appeals didn't

22 pass on that finding, did it?

23

HR. HOGEj

The court of appeals found it

24 unnecessary to reach that finding because of its ruling
25 on the racial classification ground.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

So if you were to rely on — if you

2 were to suggest that that is available to you here,
3

might not the normal course of events be for us to

4

remand it to the court of appeals for passing on --

5

reviewing that finding?
MR. HOGE;

6
7

If the Court does not agree with

the court of appeals that a racial classification was

8 established, that is one course open to the Court,
9

certainly.

However, the evidence that I will review

10

ought to satisfy the Court, I think, that a racial —

11

racially discriminatory purpose and in fact racial bias

12

was among the reasons for this initiative's adoption.

13

This Court reviews the legal validity of the court of

14

appeals* judgment.

15

reasoning of the court of appeals to affirm the judgment.

16

QUESTION;

It does not have to agree with the

Mr. Hoge, you have used the term,

17

as did the court of appeals, "racial classification."

18

Would you tell me who the members are of the respective

19

classes that the statute differentiates between?

20
21

MR. HOGE;

The statute differentiates between

the majority, the white community, and the minority

22 community in its treatment of reasons for assigning
23

students away from their neighborhood schools.

Prior to

24

enactment of the initiative, Washington had a policy

25

permitting and in fact encouraging the assignment of

3 at all.

It regulated student assignment not

That was entirely within the discretion of

4 local school districts.

After the initiative, all

5 traditional reasons for assigning students away from
6 neighborhood schools is preserved except for the resaon

7 of assigning —
8

QUESTION;

Well, but is this a classification

9 of reasons that are in a permissible and an
10 impermissible category, or is it a classification of two
11 classes of persons?
12

MR. HOGE;

It’s a classification of two

13 classes of persons, as was the statute in controversy in
14 Hunter versus Erickson, because —
15

QUESTION:

Now, who is in the favored class

16 and who is in the disfavored class?
17

MR. HOGE:

18 the white majority.

The statute favors the majority,
The protected class for purposes of

19 Fourteenth Amendment analysis is minority people who
20 have an interest in

equitable desegregated education.

21 That political and educational interest is the only one

22 that Initiative 350 affects.

23

Initiative 350 permits school districts to

24 assign students away from their neighborhood schools for
25 all reasons that exist and that school districts

2 court.

That was a finding of the district

Initiative 350 does not, however, allow the

3 minority interest in desegretated education to be
4 satisfied through the local political process.

It

5 removes only that discretion from local school
6 authorities.
7

QUESTION;

Are you telling us that the

8 Initiative 350 has resulted in a dual school system
9 again?
10

ME. HOGE;

Initiative 350, if applied in the

11 state of Washington, would resegregate the schools and
12 would therefore —
13

QUESTION;

Has it done so in Seattle?

14

MB. HOGE;

The initia tive has not been applied

15 in Seattle, because its operation has been enjoined
16 pending this hearing.
17

QUESTION;

If it is applied as it is defined,

18 how will it produce a dual school system?

Can you give

19 us that factually?
20

ME. HOGE;

Yes.

The court below found and the

21 court of appeals agreed that it would be impossible to
22 achieve any significant racial desegregation in Seattle,
23 and it would be impossible in fact to desegregate the
24 Tacoma and Pasco school systems as well without resort
25 to the tools of desegregation which are specifically

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 prohibited by Section 3 of the initiative.
2

In fact, the condition of segregation in

3 Seattle after Initiative 350 would be more dramatic,
4 more drastic segregation than has ever existed before,
5 partly because the successful mandatory middle school
6 program, which had been operating for six years, would
7 be disestablished* also because, as the district court
8 found, white parents would continue under Initiative 350
9 to move away from minority residential areas or
10 transition areas, and thereby increase residential
11 segregation and increase school segregation.
12

Moreover, blacks in Seattle, the testimony

13 showed and the court found, would take the white
14 community's repudiation of equitable desegregation as
15 expressed in Initiative 350 as a sign that they should
16 no longer continue their historic support for voluntary
17 efforts, and would themselves withdraw into their
18 neighborhood schools.
19

QUESTION:

Supposing that the school board had

20 adopted precisely the policy that is contained in
21 Initiative Number 350?

Mould you say that the school

22 board was guilty of making a racial classification?
23

MR. H0GE:

If the school board continued to

24 assign students away from their neighborhood schools for
25 all the reasons the initiative allows, that policy, if

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 it was continued, would not amount to any change in
2 Washington’s — or the Seattle School District’s former
3 history, and so it would not be an establishment of a
4 racial classification.

If the decision were made to

5 rescind the Seattle plan, that would still be by
6 reference to the neutral principles that are approved
7 under Hunter versus Erickson.
8

The decision whether to rescind the Seattle

9 plan and the validity of that decision would depend on
10 whether there was a de jure segregation condition that
11 has to be remedied or whether the decision was made with
12 a discriminatory purpose, as the court specifically
13 found was true with reference to Initiative 350.
14

QUESTION;

But absent such a finding, you

15 wouldn't say that the school board was making an
16 independently unconstitutional racial classification
17 simply by adhering to the policy contained in Initiative
18 350 .
19

MR. HOGE;

It would partly depend on whether

20 there was a rescision of an operating desegregation
21 plan, as this Court unanimously pointed out in Dayton
22 One.

But continuing a former policy of assigning to

23 neighborhood schools with the exceptions of Initiative
24 350 wouldn’t be a racial classification.
25

QUESTION;

But it becomes a racial

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

classification simply because it is done at the state

2 level rather than the school board level?
3

MR. HOGE;

Part of the reason the statute or

4 the ordinance in Hunter versus Erickson was invalidated
5 and the statute in Lee versus Nyquist was invalidated
6 was that it singled out for decision at a different
7 level of government only that part of student assignment
8 authority or housing matter authority which was of
9 interest to
10

the minority.

QUESTION:

Well, Hunter simply made any

11 ordinance pertaining to the

sale of property or

12 antidiscrimination ordinance subject to a referendum
13 where nothing else was subject to a

referendum, didn’t

14 it?
15

MR. HOGE:

All matters under the Akron housing

16 law were subject to ordinance.
17 subject to local referendum.

The peculiar — or
Any statute or ordinance

18 passed by the city counsel could be subjected to
19 referendum.

Only racial housing ordinances were

20 subjected to automatic referendum.
21

QUESTION:

22 against Erickson?

What is your analogy here to Hunter
Is it — It is certainly not the

23 action of the school board,

and it isn't the structure

24 of the state's referendum statute, is it, because that
25 is certainly neutral on its face?

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. HOGE

The analogy to Hunter is that in

2 Hunter, only matters dealing with racial housing laws
3 were subjected to that unusual procedure, the automatic
4 referendum.

Here, only racial student assignments are

5 subjected to the new state rule prohibiting assignment
6 away from the nearest or next nearest school.
7

QUESTION

But is there any doubt under

i

8 Washington law that if the Seattle school board had
9 refused to adopt its policy of busing for racial
10 balance, the proponents of that policy could have put
11 the thing on a referendum, and if it were passed it
12 would have the same effect as if it had been adopted by
13 the school board?
14

MR. H0GE«

If the statute had been enacted not

15 to dismantle the Seattle plan, then that would be one
16 factor in its favor.

It would be not so likely to give

17 rise to an inference of impermissible purpose, but if it
18 was in practice a racial classification in the context
19 of the adoption of such a statute, then that would
20 similarly be invalid.
21

I would like to spend some time describing for

22 the Court the nature of the evidence of discriminatory
23 purpose which the district court relied on in reaching
24 its finding that racial bias or prejudice was a factor
25 in the adoption of Initiative 350.

voters are thinking when they are voting, when they vote

3

HR. HOGE:

Hell, Judge Yorhees at the district

4

court said that was impossible, to tell what was in the

5

mind of the voters, and he therefore relied on expert

6 testimony presented by both sides, polls presented by
7

the state of Washington, and the objective indices in

8 discriminatory intent that this Court outlined in
9 Arlington Heights.
10

QUESTION:

Well, do you do that regularly in

11

Washington, take a poll after an election to see what

12

made the people vote the way they voted?

13

MR. HOGE:

Well, this was — no, we don’t, and

14

that — as plaintiffs, we acquiesced in the submission

15

by the state of Washington of a poll which showed that a

16

significant proportion of the whites in this nation

17

still openly favor separation of the races.

18
19

QUESTION:

Well, do you identify opposition to

busing for racial balance with a discriminatory racial

20 purpose, or do you?
21

MR. HOGE:

Not necessarily, and this Court

22 doesn’t need to make that determination in this case.
23

QUESTION:

But you think the judge here found

24

not only that the motivation was to do away with racial

25

balance by busing, but also found there was a

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

discriminatory racial purpose involved?
MR. HOGE;

2

That there was racial bias or

3 prejudice at least in part in the making of that
4 decision.
5

For instance. Dr. James -QUESTION;

6 discrimination

Normally, isn't racial bias or

demonstrated objectively?

7

MR. HOGE;

Yes, the fact --

8

QUESTION;

By what people do rather than by

9 what they think?
MR. HOGE;

10
11

Yes.

One of — of course, one of

the best demonstrations of racial bias or purpose is the

12 racial classification.

There can be little better proof

13 of a discriminatory purpose at work than a law which
14 singles out for different and disadvantageous treatment
15 the interests of the minority as compared with the
16 interests of the majority, but beyond the simply racial
17 classification, the objective indices that the Court
18 outlined in Arlington Heights also established a
19 discriminatory purpose at work.
20

21 decision.

Significant among those is the impact of the
As we know, impact alone will not establish

22 an equal protection violation.

However, the Court found

23 that under Initiative 350, there could be no significant
24 desegregation of the Seattle schools.

It found that the

25 burden — that segregated schools lead to poorer

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 education and that the burden of segregated schools
2 falls most heavily on minority people.

That is the same

3 conclusion this Court made in Brown, and the same
4 conclusion that Congress and President Nixon made in
5 enacting the Emergency School Aid Act.
6

The impact was a certainty, and it was known

7 in advance, and the court concluded that that was a
8 factor in determining whether it was intended in the
9 adoption of Initiative 350.
10

Another significant objective index of intent

11 is the sequence of events.

In Arlington Heights, the

12 Court concluded that application of the village's
13 long-standing high-density — low-density zoning to an
14 application for rezone from a low-income housing project
15 did not show anything but neutrality at work, but the
16 Court said it would be a far different case if that
17 zoning decision to have low-density was made after the
18 application of the housing development authority for a
19 low-income housing project.
20

This case is that different case.

Prior to

21 adoption, prior to adoption of the Seattle plan,
22 Washington state encouraged efforts of local school
23 districts to take action to desegregate their schools by
24 whatever means available.

It was only after adoption of

25 the Seattle plan that the state decided to take unto

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

itself the authority to regulate student assignments,

2 and even then, it only took unto itself the authority to

3 regulate student assignments for desegregation.
Those same factors also show the substantive

4

5 and procedural departures from the norm which the Court
6 outlined in Arlington Heights as indices of

7 discriminatory intent at work.
The drafting history and the campaign history

8

9 of the initiative all show an intent on the part of the
10 initiative’s proponents to limit only desegregation
11

busing.

In the course of drafting the initiative, the

12 proponents wrote to all 300

Washington school districts

13 and asked for advice as to how to avoid interference
14 with any student assignment autority of those school
15 districts, and indeed the president of CVIC testified
16 that Section 3 of the initiative was drafted
17 specifically to prohibit the elements of the Seattle
18 plan .
19

The campaign history was similar.

CVIC, the

20 Citizens for Voluntary Integration Committee, which was
21 advocating for the initiative statewide,

constantly

22 campaigned on the theme that the initiative would permit

23 maximum flexibility for school districts, that it would
24 only affect busing for racial desegregation, and in fact
25 they said repeatedly that 99 percent of Washington's 300

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

school districts would not be affected by the

2 initiative.

And we agree.

One percent of Washington's

3 300 school districts are affected by this initiative,
4 and it is the three school districts out of Washington's
5 300 school districts that have racial desegregation
6 plans.

7

QUESTION*

Well, I take it if there weren’t

8 any, if there weren't any school districts that had a

9 voluntary desegregation plan, if the initiative were
10 passed,
11

then no school district could have one, and you

would be making the same argument, wouldn’t you?

12

ME. HOGEi

Yes —

13

QUESTION*

Suppose as of today, no school

14 district in Washington had adopted a voluntary
15 desegregation plan, but this initiative is now the law,
16 and no school district could have one under the
17 initiative.
18

Wouldn’t you be making the same argument?

MR. H0GE*

I believe I would.

Only if

19 Washington were a one-race state would it be of no
20 significance that a law giving school districts the
21

authority to assign away from neighborhood schools for

22 all traditional reasons but not for race be of

23 significance .
24

2UESTI0N*

25 the 350 says, is it?

Well, of course, that isn't what
It doesn't say that you may assign

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

for all reasons except race.

It doesn’t say that.

2

fTR. HOGEj

No.

3

QUESTION;

It says that you must adhere to a

In fact, by design, the --

4 neighborhood school policy except for certain reasons.
5

NR. HOGE;

It says assign students to nearby

6 schools except for certain reasons, and then it lists

7 the reasons that completely swallowed the rule, as all
8 the testimony showed, except for racial desegregation.

9 In fact, one of the initiative’s drafters testified that
10 the reason the initiative was not just a strict
11

prohibition on assignments for racial reasons was the

12 fear of the proponent group that if it was directed only

13 at racial student assignments, some school district that
14 wanted to desegregate might try to do so and say that we
15 are not desegregating, we are just doing this for
16 educational reasons, and pairing our schools or
17 clustering our schools for that kind of reason, and it
18 was for that reason that the techniques of the Seattle
19 plan were specifically prohibited.
20
21

QUESTION;

Hell, doesn’t Finding 8.3 cover the

point Justice White made, that the only significant

22 reason that is forbidden is the racial balancing reason?

23

MR. HOGEi

Exactly.

The court's findings are

24 very explicit and often repetitive on that point.
25

In short, then, this case is not one like

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Arlington Heights, or Washington v. Davis, or Feeney, or

2 James, or Memphis, where the lower courts found no
«

3 discriminatory purpose at work.

This is a case where

4 the lower court found discriminatory purpose on the
5 basis of direct evidence and objective indices as
6 outlined by this Court in the past.

Many of these

7 findings were expressly adopted by the court of appeals,
8 and

therefore, we submit, should be accepted by this

9 Court.
QUESTION;

10
11

12

ballot?

How does an initiative get on the

By signature?
MR. HOGE;

That’s correct.

The proponents of

13 an initiative must first acquire a significant number of
14 signatures, I think in this case over 100,000, before
15 the initiative is put on the election ballot.

It is

16 significant in this regard that the signature campaign
17 for this initiative was featured by, among other things,
18 full-page newspaper ads in major newspapers around the
19 state, saying that the initiative was being proposed in
20 reaction to a desegregation plan proposed by the Seattle
21 school board.

22

You can find that in Exhibit 38, Page 49.

So, for the reasons I have outlined,

the fact

23 that this is an undisputed racial classification which
24 disadvantages minority interests, because there has been
25 a showing and a finding of discriminatory purpose at

work., on the basis of all the evidence, including

2 evidence you will find in the Joint Appendix at Pages
3 92,

104, 89 to 90, 78,

165 to 166,

100, Exhibit A,

133,

4 the poll introduced by the state, and Page 104 to 105 of
5 the Joint Appendix.

QUESTION;

6

What is the evidence?

What was the

7 evidence before the district court on which it reached a
8 conclusion,

made a finding that if this initiative were

9 carried out, it would then interfere with Constitutional
10 rights?
11

MR. H0GE;

It would interfere with

12 Constitutional rights because it would make impossible

13 achievement of —
14

QUESTION;

Well, but how did he come to the

15 conclusion that if it was applied it would do that when
16 it had not yet been applied?
17

MR. H0GE;

Well, there was much evidence

18 offered by both sides which attempted to describe the
19 effect the initiative would have if implemented.

Expert

20 witnesses for both sides testified as to the effects of
21

the initiative if implemented, and it was clear on the

22 basis of all that testimony, including testimony offered
23 by the state's witnesses,

that Seattle could not achieve

24 any significant desegregation under the initiative.
25

It therefore disadvantages minority interests

1 in a desegregated education by an equitable
2 desegregation plan, but doesn't place any similar
3 disadvantage or restriction on school districts when the
4 school district is seeking to serve the interests of the
5 majority, which in all the — all the exceptions of the
6 initiative are simply race-neutral, common sense reasons
7 why school districts assign away from neighborhood
8 schools, all of which could be overcome by spending more
9 money.
10

This Court has seen this country out of --

11 partway, now, out of our troubled racial history, and
12 for 30 years, since the 1950's, the Court has shown
13 moral leadership to the nation.

There has been uniform

14 resistance in school districts across the country to
15 desegregation for school districts, but this Court's
16 moral leadership is now starting to take hold.

Seattle

17 is the first major American city that has desegregated
18 out of a feeling that it had a Constitutional duty to do
19 so, and because it believes in the benefits of
20 desegregated education for all students, but most
21 importantly for minority students.
22

Certainly there is nothing in the Dayton and

23 Columbus decisions decided two years ago that makes it
24 look like the Seattle School District misapplied or
25 misanalyzed the law in deciding to desegregate its

47

2

QUESTION;

Do you think — I am not sure from

3 your submission whether you think that the court of
4 appeals was justified in arriving at his judgment by
5 just finding what it thought to be a racial
6 classification.
7

NR. HOGE:

Yes, a racial classification which

8 disadvantages minority interests is, as the Court said
9 in Feeney, presumptively unconstitutional and can be
10 sustained only—
11

QUESTION:

So the district court didn't need

12 to make these findings about purpose in your view.
13

MR. HOGE;

We don't believe they did, but they

14 certainly furnished further support for this Court
15 upholding -16

QUESTION;

Well, you don't suggest that it is

17 necessary to find a discriminatory purpose.

Isn't it

18 necessary to do that?

MR. HOGE;

We think this Court's decision in

20 Washington versus -21

QUESTION:

You are suggesting there is a

22 violation of the Fourteenth Amendment here, aren't you?
23

MR. HOGE:

That's the essence of our case, sir.

24

QUESTION:

Well, must there not be a purpose,

25 a purposeful racial discrimination?

48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MB. HOGEi

Yes, and racial classification is

2 probably the best evidence of purposeful discrimation.
3

QUESTION:

Well, that may be the best

4 evidence, but it isn't equivalent to a finding, is it?
5

MR. HOGE:

No, but we have those findings,

6 too, in this cse.
7

QUESTION:

Well, you don't have it in the

8 court of appeals.
9

MR. HOGE:

Well, the court of appeals,

10 following this Court's decision in Feeney said that a
11 racial classification regardless of purported motivation
12 is presumptively unconstitutional and can be upheld only
13 upon an extraordinary showing.

No compelling state

14 interest was advanced in support of this initiative.

In

15 fact, the initiative is the virtual antithesis of what
16 has been held to be a compelling state interest, an
17 interest in a desegregated education.
18

QUESTION:

Well, it certainly was explicit in

19 Feeney, wasn't it, the classification.
20

MR. HOGE;

The language is explicit.

It was

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH 0. EIKENBERRG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - REBUTTAL

10

MR. EIKENBERRY;

11

By way of rebuttal, and alluding to a comment

12 made by counsel,

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

the record here before the Court does

13 have evidence to show that there was a substantial
14 percentage of Washington minorities, probably a majority
15 of Washington minorities who were opposed to the Seattle
16 plan and in favor of 350.

How, then, can it be said

17 that this group of people is somehow disadvantaged by
18 passage of a state law which they favored and its impact
19 on a program which they opposed?
20 disadvantage minorities.

350 simply does not

Not all minorities favor

21 busing, and not all whites are opposed to it.

22

I would like to leave this Court, if I may,

23 withi what I believe are the important questions to be
24 addressed for, especially, perhaps, in this case getting
25 at the right questions is critical to the decision, and

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the question that was raised. Your Honor, was racial

2 animus or antipathy, a decisive or even a significant

3 factor in the adoption of the initiative by the voters.
4 More broadly, does the initiative embody a
5 race-dependent decision?

And we believe the answer is

6 no.

7

Would it have been a race-dependent decision

8 even if, by its terms, it had applied only to achieve
9 busing for greater

racial balance, and again we believe

10 that answer must be no.

Perhaps this question brought up, too, by the

11
12 Court;

Aren't the school districts really trying to

13 play a semantic word game by equating the terms
14 "segregation." "racial imbalance," and "racial
15 isolation?"

We believe the answer is yes, and they have

16 been doing so to give themselves a leg up on their
17 argument that the Seattle plan is Constitutionally
18 sacrosanct.
Does 350 impose any special burdens or indeed

19

20 any burdens at all on minority students in Washington
21

schools?

Here again, we believe the answer is no,

22 because everyone is accustomed to going to the

23 legislature for major policy decisions.
24

Finally, if you affirm on this case, what are

25 the implications for affirmative action programs —

17 they want.
18

Isn’t that what you said?
MR. EIKENBERRY;

I suggested. Your Honor, that

19 minorities have good effect in the legislature, in the
20 laws — and I invite the Court's scrutiny of Chapter
21 28-A of the code of the state of Washington, which I
22 believe does have laws that are beneficial to
23 minorities, and that Washington has been in the
24 forefront of states enacting civil rights legislation.

another question about racial animus and racial intent?

What do you think Washington v. Davis

Does it require some kind of unfavorable

6 attitude toward a

minority, an animus, a dislike, or

7 does it merely require a deliberate decision which
8 results in a classification?

MR. EIKENBERRY*

The animus is the intent to

So you read Washington v. Davis to

Is it correct that if we accept Finding 8.3,
