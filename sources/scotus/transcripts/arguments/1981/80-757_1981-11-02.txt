ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. HEGARTY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HEGARTY;

9

10 the
11 that

Court, let me begin by going back to 1936,
Justice Powell referred to.

12 debates,

In the Congressional

Exchange Act, a decision of this Court was

into the record.

15 pre-existing
16 who

to the era

the Senate debate concerning the 1936 amendments to

13 the Commodity
14 read

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

That decision had held that the

Act could not provide a remedy against someone

was accused of having manipulated the market because the

17 statute

was framed in terms of is manipulating, present

18 tense.
19

This Court said that the proceeding could not go

20 forward.

It affirmed the lower court, which it so held.

21 said, and this, as I say,
22 entire decision by
23 this Court,

It

was read into the record, the

Justice Brandeis, a unanimous decision of

to supply omissions transcends the judicial

24 f unction.
25

I don’t believe that the perception of the role of

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the Congress and of the judiciary in 1936 and earlier, and
2 even since has been -- has gone through the sea changes that
3 are suggested by the Respondents and by the CFTC.
4 much mention has been made of Rigsby.

Indeed,

In that decision, it

5 seems to me, as I read it, that Justice Pitney was very,
6 very careful to have two bases for his decision.

One indeed

7 was for the use of the remedium, but immediately thereafter
8 he said the inference is made irresistible by the language
9 of the statute, and I don't think that is very different
10 from Cort v. Ash, if one thinks about it.
11

Sow, the argument in the earlier case is different

12 in two respects from the questions presented presently.
13 That case involves a section of the Commodity Exchange Act,
14 Section 4b, which is for the benefit by claim of a customer
15 and it provides that his broker may not defraud him.

That

16 language might suffice for the first factor in Cort.
17 Representing a contract market, I am addressing different
18 sections, Sections 5d, 5a(R), and perhaps 9b, which is the
19 general criminal statute against manipulation.

20

5d is the licensing statute.

It says that boards

21 of trade will be designated as contract markets if they
22 satisfy certain criteria, one of which is to have a system
23 to prevent manipulation — not to prevent manipulation,

24 to have a system to prevent it.

5a(8) is prescriptive.

but
It

25 says that one of the things the contract market must do is

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 enforce its rules
2

These ace quite patently for the general benefit

3 of the -- well, it certainly goes far beyond the futures
4 market.

It goes to the cash market, as it is called, the

5 production, the handling, the use of commodities.
6

The other very significant distinction between the

7 4b question and the question posed as against a contract
8 market is a practical distinction.

It is a question of

9 practical consequences, and implicit, if I can use the word
10 in this general context, holding of the Second Circuit or
11 the court below was that a cash trader, that is, a person
12 not trading in the futures market at all, but holding cash
13 potatoes, had a claim against the contract market because of
14 an alleged failure on its part to act in an emergency.
15

That opens up, it seems to me, the picture of not

16 only which we would have in the Securities Acts functioning
17 on the trading in a particular security or something of that
18 sort.

It goes beyond that.

It is trading in a futures

19 contract, but then the impact of that trading, that alleged

20 manipulation might have on the cash product.

In other

21 words, manipulation in wheat in the Chicago Board of Trade,
22 the price fixed in the Chicago Board of Trade is used, as
23 they call it, for price discovery by those who are actually
24 delivering wheat to mills.

25

This is, as Judge Mansfield said in dissent below,

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 what is involved is literally hundreds of millions of
2 dollars.
3 way.

How, I don't cite that in a kind of interorum

I cite it for this purpose.

It seems to me that when

4 the consequences are such, when the possible result is such,
5 it bears very directly on whether one can assume that
6 Congress intended such a result or chose not to say so,
7 which after all is the fundamental question.
8

I regret that the Solicitor General's office did

9 not choose to argue in this case, to deal with questions of
10 that sort, although they briefed them, I suppose.
11

Now, the three sections that interest the contract

12 markets are Section 5d , as I said.
13 1921.

That was enacted in

At that time, a companion statute enacted the same

14 month was the Packers and Stockyards Act, which provided
15 both for reparations and private damages against the
16 stockyard and others, and I think it is suggested that te
17 two statutes go in tandem, and no such remedy is provided in
18 the Commodity -- as it was then called, the Grain Futures
19 Act, I think.
20

9b was enacted in

1936, and as I say, in Wallace

21 against Cutten, a case which I quoted from, it was before
22 Congress, very much before Congress at that point.

23
24 in

5a(8), as I say, Subdivision a(8) was added to 5a
1968, at a time when Congress did not enact a bill which

25 would have provided an action against contract markets.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now we come to 1974, and a unanimous panel of the

2 Fifth Circuit said that the legislative history was
3 emphatically equivocal in that that was not a sufficient
4 basis to predicate a private right of action.
5

QUESTION:

That is an interesting expression,

6 isn't it?
7

MR. HEGARTY:

It is.

I think it was very well

8 chosen.
9

QUESTION:

Interesting expression, "empatically"

10

MR. HEGARTY:

"Equivocal."

11

(General laughter.)

12

MR. HEGARTY:

They said also, to

substantiate

13 their point, Justice White, that the evidence as to whether
14 or not Congress was aware of the one appellate court
15 decision -16

QUESTION:

It is like saying the

Congressional

17 silence was very loud indeed.

18

NR. HEGARTY:

That is what the court below said,

19 Your Honor, but the Fifth Circuit thought that the evidence

20 was dubious, if you will, that Congress as a whole had any
21 awareness of the one decision, one appellate decision that
22 upheld a cause of action against a contract market.

They

23 said there was no evidence that Congress had approved it.
24

In the opinion from the majority below, it was

25 described as implicit approval by Congress,

and I think to

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 premise

2 by

an implied right of action upon an implicit approval

Congress in emphatically equivocal legislative history

3 piles too much
4

on too shaky a foundation.

In 1974,

if you look at objective evidence again

5 as to contract markets,

they did not enact a private action

6 against contract markets.
7 remedy from

which contract markets are excluded.

8 specifically authorize
9 suits in district
10 added

They did enact the reparations

the CFTC to bring injunction for

courts against contract markets, and they

to the penalty provision the direction to the CFTC to

11 consider

whether the amount of the penalty would materially

12 impair the contract

13 operations and

market's ability to carry on its

duties,

and I don't think a possible exposure

14 to hundreds of millions of dollars could
15 consistent

be said to be

with that.
If there was a dramatic overhaul of the statute in

16

17 1974, it is similar to that
18 subject of

which occurred and was the

this Court's decision in City of Milwaukee.

19 There had been a federal common
20 nuisance.
21 a

They did

The Seventh Circuit had held here that there was

common law cause of action against contract markets, the

22 one appellate decision.
23 contract --

I think it would follow that such a

common law cause of action had been supplanted

24 by the legislation.
25

Finally, let me say this.

The question posed is,

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is there a private right of action, is there an implied
2 private right of action, but that is a very, very narrow
3 question.

The question really should be, is there a private

4 right of action having certain dimensions?
5

For example,

there is no guidance whatsoever in

6 this statute for a determination, as was present in the case
7 of Ocville, as to what standard of liability should exist,
8 what measure of culpability is required for this action.

If

9 we go back to the District Court in this case, where
10 negligence is alleged, I would move to dismiss on the
11 grounds that bad faith had not been alledged.

But I have no

12 guidance.

It is too

The District Court will have none.

13 simplistic a question to ask whether a private right of
14 action is implied, I submit.
15

I will say one final point, if I may, in answer to

16 the question posed by Hr. Justice White earlier on.

I think

17 there must be affirmative evidence to create the action.

We

18 cannot invert the burden of inquiry, as occurred here.
19

I don't wish to intrude upon the time of counsel

20 to argue for the brokers,

unless there be any questions.

21 Perhaps I should say further intrude.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERARD K.

Mr. Sandweg?
SANDWEG, JR., ESC.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SANDWEG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the Court, the guestion to be decided by the Court is in
2 what forum under the Commodity Exchange Act as enacted by
3 Congress can a private party obtain redress for alleged
4 violations of the Commodity Exchange Act?
5

QUESTION;

Against whom?

6

MR. SANDWEG;

Against, in this case, a futures

7 commission merchant, and in the consolidated cases that we
8 have here also an exchange.
9
10

QUESTION;

Right.

MR. SANDWEG;

Otherwise stated, the issue is

11 whether Congress created a private right of action for
12 violation of the particular sections of the Commodity
13 Exchange Act.
14

I think first we have to focus on the statute as

15 it now exists, and see its application to the facts here at
16 issue.
17

QUESTION;

Could I justmake

18

MR. SANDWEG;

19

QUESTION;

sure

--

Yes, sir.
-- with thesepartiesinvolved, was

20 there a reparations remedy?
21

MR. SANDWEG;

22

QUESTION;

No party filed for reparations.

But is there one under the statute or

23 not ?
24

MR. SANDWEG;

Your Honor, we believe that there is

25 one .

QUESTIONi

Your colleagues on the other side are

2 to the contrary, I take it,
3

MR. SANDWEGi

4

QUESTION;

5

MR.

My colleagues are to the contrary.

All right.

SANDWEG:

Thank you.

The statute here expresses

6 Congress's decision as to how to regulate the nation's
7 commodities and markets.

To put its decision into effect,

8 we have the Commodity Exchange Act.
9 regulatory system.

It is a multi-faceted

The exchanges regulate their members,

10 including the broker petitioners, through their bylaws,
11 rules, and disciplinary proceedings.
12

Over everything, however, is the Commodity Futures

13 Trading Commission.

It can compel the adoption,

14 modification , or repeal of an exchange's rules and
15 regulations.

It exercises oversight and appellate

16 jurisdiction over the self-regulatory entities.

It is

17 empowered to participate directly in regulatory and
18 enforcement matters, and indeed, it routinely does so.
19

QUESTION;

Mr. Sandweg, excuse me for

20 interrupting, but on the reparations point -- you say there
21 is a reparations remedy -- am I right in believing that the
22 Commission takes the position there is none?
23

MR. SANDWEGi

The Commission takes the position

24 that there is none.
25

QUESTIONi

Well, if they take the position there

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is none, and they deny all claims of this kind, and there is
2 no review of it, how can it be an effective remedy?
3

MR. SANDWEG:

Your Honor, I think that it is not

4 fair to say that there is no review.

The provisions of the

5 administrative -6

QUESTION;

Well, if they say there is no remedy,

7 that is a reviewable decision if somebody filed there?
8

MR. SANDWEG;

Your Honor, we believe it is.

We

9 think that a decision that there is no reparations right is
10 appealable to the courts under both the Administrative
11 Procedure Act and under fundamental notions of due process,
12 if the Commission were to take that view, which it
13 apparently does.
14

The Commission here has been highly visible in

15 what it has done.

The exchange, acting in its

16 self-regulatory role, held price and penalty hearings to
17 compensate those persons who had defaulted, and penalized
18 the defaulting parties.

The Business Conduct Committee of

19 the exchange held hearings regarding violations of the

20 exchange rules.

The CFTC conducted an extensive

21 investigation and instituted disciplinary proceedings
22 against the exchange and the short sellers, but not against
23 the brokers.
24

Our position is that the Respondents, had they

25 been so inclined, could have instituted reparations

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 proceedings, and upon proof of the claimed violations,
2 obtained an award for their damages.
3

In short, the regulatory scheme enacted by

4 Congress and in place provides a comprehensive system for
5 discipline of wrongdoers and compensation of victims.
6

Now, let us turn to the Respondents who

7 participated in the market and here claim damages.

They

8 claim they are entitled to damages in a federal lawsuit not
9 only on the basis of the antitrust violations which they
10 claim, but also on the basis of an implied private right of
11 action which they contend are implicit in the Commodity
12 Exchange Act.
13

We submit the implied right of action does not

14 exist on two bases.

The first and the controlling basis is

15 that it simply was not created by Congress.

We believe,

16 however, in case one questions does this make sense, that
17 the fact of the reparations remedy explains but does not
18 control over our position.

19

The burden here is on the Respondents to

20 demonstrate affirmative Congressional intent to create the

21 remedy.

None of the Respondents have done this, because

22 they can *t.
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Sandweg, let me ask you a question

24 somewhat akin to what Justice Powell asked previous
25 counsel.

There is much talk in the record and in the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 statute itself about "manipulative devices".
2 manipulative device?
3 negligence?
4

How do you prove it?

What is a
Is it

Is it bad faith?

HE. SANDWEGi

The court decisions on the question

5 of the existence of manipulation are numerous and generally
6 they refer to it as anything that the mind of man can
7 imagine.

Therefore, the question of what is manipulative is

8 not at all well defined.

It is not a scorecard where you

9 can go to to check off the indicia and say that you have or
10 do not have manipulation.
11

QUESTION;

Well, how does a judge charge a jury,

12 then, as to whether or not they should find on the evidence
13 that this was or was not a manipulative device?
14

MR. SANDWEGi

I have not seen the jury

15 instructions in the cases that have come out.
16

QUESTION;

Well, but in a typical case.

17

MR. SANDWEG:

I am not sure.

I think it is most

18 difficult to actually prove a manipulation of a commodities
19 market, because of the fact you have so many forces of
20 supply and demand meeting.
21 manipulation.

There can be simple questions of

For example, the corner, where someone

22 controls the entire supply, and controls that supply other
23 than through a legal way.

24

QUESTION:

To a certain extent, everybody is

25 trying to manipulate, aren't they?

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SANDWEG:

That's true. Your Honor.

Everyone

2 is attempting to participate in the price discovery process
3 by buying or selling for a price they determine to be
4 appropriate.
5

QUESTION*

Mr. Sandweg, the description Judge

6 Friendly gave us of the transaction here, would that fall
7 within your definition of a manipulative device?

On the

8 potatoes ?
9

MR. SANDWEG:

Your Honor, I think the question of

10 manipulation of the potatoes market is a very difficult
11 factual question which isn't here.
12

QUESTION:

Certainly the --

I know it is not, but I am just asking

13 whether the description Judge Friendly gave us in page after
14 page after page -15

MR. SANDWEG:

From Judge Friendly's description,

16 there were two major forces moving in the marketplace.
17 client fortunately was not one of them.

Our

It would appear

18 that they could be characterized as manipulation, but
19 whether or not that is a proper legal conclusion, I don't
20 speak to today.

I think it is a very difficult fact

21 question, and one of the reasons we think the CFTC exists is
22 to resolve that very difficult fact question, where they
23 have the advantage of the particular knowledge of what can
24 and cannot be manipulative in commodities markets.

25

In 1936, Congress passed a comprehensive law to

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 regulate a marketplace which has, had, and continues to have
2 a major effect on interstate commerce.
3 protecting the nation's economy.

Its concern was

The language of the

4 Commodity Exchange Act in 1936, when the operative sections
5 at issue were passed, has not one word suggestive of an
6 intent to create a right of action.

The legislative history

7 likewise has not one word.
8

Because of Congressional concern that federal

9 pre-emption might occur with respect to individual conduct,
10 it preserved under Section 4c the right to bring actions
11 under state law in state courts.

In 1974, the Commodity

12 Exchange Act was amended, but it was not re-enacted.

None

13 of the amendments created a private right of action.
14

The legislative history of the 1974 amendments

15 tells us nothing about any 1974 amendment which would create
16a private right of action.

The twig on which the CFTC has

17 asked this Court to hang its hat is a jurisdictional savings
18 clause which, as the Touche case teaches us, cannot create a
19 right of action.

20

The remaining legislative history, ambiguous at

21 best, tells us nothing except for perhaps a limited
22 knowledge of what courts had done between 1 936 and

1974,

23 but courts cannot create private rights of action.

At best,

24 they can examine statutory language and legislative history

25 and find that Congress implicitly created the right.

No

17

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 court had done that prior to 1974
2

This Court has asked whether or not Cort v. Ash

3 compels a different analysis.
4

QUESTION;

I think the Court --

You suggest, then, that Rigsby was just

5 way out of bounds?
6

MS. SANDWEG;

I think Mr. Hegarty's presentation

7 of Rigsby is correct, but I think that Rigsby no longer
8 speaks to the current situation.
9

QUESTION;

So your answer is, yes, Rigsby was just

10 wrong?
11

MR. SANDWEG:

I think it was wrong.

The 4b here,

12 the Court also asked whether or not 4b was limited, and I
13 think that is very important to this case.
14 broker-customer relations.

4b speaks to

It does not speak to the kind of

15 relationship between the broker members here and the
16 claimants.

They are not customers of any brokers.

And as

17 Judge Friendly pointed out, the crabbed language of 4b is
18 difficult to interpret, but I think the only proper
19 interpretation is, it reaches a broker-customer claim.

20

We have mentioned that we think that reparations

21 are important not because they upheld the decision, but
22 rather because they respond to the argument that is here

24 Congress gives the remedy.

Egually important, the factual

Reparations reaches persons registered and

3 required to register, and affords a comprehensive remedy

Section 13a of the Act, which

5 already existed, reaches deeply into those associated with
6 wrongdoing and allows them to be proceeded against as
7 principals.

As our brief discusses, we believe full relief is

9 available to those injured by a violation of the Commodity

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD T0B0R0FF, ESQ.,

16
17

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. TOBOROFF:

Mr. Justice, Mr. Chief Justice, and

18 may it please the Court, so far in the presentations so far,
19 facts have been withheld by the defendants, understandably

20 so because they are crucial to the application of this
21 Court's standards to this statute determining legislative
22 intent.
23

The facts are these.
In a limited and perishable commodity, potatoes,

24 manipulators named Simplot and Taggares oversold the entire
25 crop threefold.

They never intended to liquidate it.

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Their

1 contracts -- to take delivery of their short sales, and as a
2 result they artificially depressed the price, irrespective
3 of the normal supply and demand factors, which are what the
4 commodity futures markets have the right to expect.
5

In short, they and their brokers fixed the market

6 and ultimately destroyed it, in full view of the exchange,
7 which kwowingly permitted it.
8

The plaintiffs are entitled to deal with a free

9 and fair futures market pursuant to the Congressional
10 purpose and in accordance with the legislative scheme.
11 Instead, they were thrown into a fixed market manipulated by
12Simplot, Taggares, and others who are not before this Court
13 in this process, and not subject at all to reparations,
14 incidentally, and who have carefully and tactically absented
15 themselves from this Court here, but their conduct is not
16 absent.
17

No one challenges that the conduct violated the

18 statute.

No one challenges that the market was polluted in

19 violation of the Congressional purpose.

Those facts

20 delineating that conduct by those people are set forth in
21 exhaustive detail by Judge Friendly below in the record, at
22 Pages 95 through 105 of the Joint Appendix, and I will
23 refrain from repeating any of them, but will rely on that

24 exposition, and note that if Judge Friendly is reversed ,
25 those major manipulators will go scot free, leaving their

MR. TOBOROFF;

QUESTION:

1974 --

Suppose this very case that we have

8 arose, and the only thing that is different is that there
9 never had been any judicial judgments about private causes
10 of action prior to 1 974.
11

MR. TOBOROFF:

We would still have the private

12 right of action, because we had something else in addition
13 to the unbroken chain of eleven to fourteen decisions.

We

14 have 50 years of Congressional experience, starting in 1921,
15 as to major market manipulations.

This is not like the

16 Curran situation, the customer-broker.

We have a situation

17 where from 1921 on Congress focused concern on the major
18 market manipulators.

They named some of them in some of the

19 Congressiona1 testimony.

I can't remember their names.

20 remember one, Arthur Cutten, I think.

I

But they named a

21 bunch of them, and they focused their concern on that
22 person, or that group of persons, who through large

23 concentrations of money could throw an entire market out of
24 whack.

Congress was not writing on a blank slate.

MR. TOBOROFF*

No, Deaktor -- there was a

7 memorandum opinion in Deaktor on December 3, 1974, I
8 believe.

I am sure.

9

When that case came down, ten days later. Chairman

10 Poge opened the hearings and emphasized to the entire House,
11 and I am quoting, "Courts have implied a private remedy for
12 individual litigants under the Commodity Exchange Act.”
13

Now, even if Deaktor was wrong, and I don't think

14 it was -- I think it was right -- but even if it was wrong,
15 Congress understood that the courts, including the United
16 States Supreme Court, had the question before it, and
17 everyone had recognized, without a hint of a dissent, that
18 there was a private right of action, and that is when
19 Congress set down --

20

QUESTION*

But you must take the next step from

21 that and say that Congress also must be understood in 1974
22 to have said, and the courts have been quite right as to
23 what our intention was, that there is a private cause of

24 action .

In 1974, Congress in effect said, I

MR. TOBOROFF;

In that case, I will take the next

MR. TOBOROFF;

21

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Let's get back to the hypothetical that

22 Justice White asked, which was,

let's assume that there had

23 been no federal court decisions prior to the Act of 1974.

24 On that assumption, where would the burden of proof have
25 lain in this litigation?

MR. TOBOROFF:

3

QUESTIONS

On my friends over here on my left.

What have our cases said about that?

I

4 have understood up until today that certainly absent the
5 sort of line of judicial decisions you rely on, if one
6 claimed there was an implied cause of action, that he had
7 the burden of establishing Congressional intent.

Didn't

MR. TOBOROFF:

Yes, sir.

It depends -- When

11 Congress sits down, it depends what they are writing on, the
12 slate that they are writing on.

Fven without that line,

There was a reason that they

15 sat down, 50 years of experience, to protect -- and the

17 operation of a fair and free market for the benefit of the

QUESTION:

hay I try another hypothetical?

6

MR. TOBOROFF:

7

QUESTION;

Surely, sir.

Let's suppose there were no prior

8 experience whatever, that this was a de novo attempt to
9 regulate the commodities market, and no prior judicial
10 decisions.

Where would the burden of proof lie if you filed

11 this complaint?
12

MR. TOBOROFF;

I will finally retreat to the

13 recent decisions, but I say that our case is sui generis and
14 miles distant from those decisions, because of those two
15 experiences.

Congress, we recognize that the court, although retaining

14

the commission to unravel the intricate technical facts of

15

the commodity industry and arrive at some judgment as to

16

whether the exchange had conducted itself in compliance with

the law."

18

MR. T0B0R0FF;

That is my point, sir.

The very

19

words -- I tried to jot them down fast as read, were

"alleged violations of the CEA", which was in th e record

1 Friendly did in the question raised by Mr. Justice Powell
2 where the statute doesn’t utter a single word in its
3 language.

As I say, you must go through that language.

You

4 must look at everything, and concluding from that language
5 that there is a private right of action.
6

The exchange in its reply brief wants to stop at

7 the front door of the language in the statute, and they wind
8 it up by sort of a little bit of a scare tactic, saying that
9 if we don't stop here, we are going to have a lot of clogged
10 dockets.

There are going to be a lot of lawsuits.

They are

11 asking for, it seems to me, a little bit of judicial
12 legislation today, something they couldn't get in 1974 when
13 Congress switched the theory from self-regulation to
14 compulsory regulation, and I rather think that isn't
15 entirely true.
16

I rather think that the way to empty the dockets

17 is just to affirm Judge Friendly’s decision.

There are no

18 more major market manipulations, and there won't be a lot of
19 cases because there won't be any manipulations.

I think

20 that is the best way to do it, and I think that is what
21 Congress intended, and I think that in the Congressional
22 scheme, the legislative scheme and the Congressional
23 purpose, the private right of action was one of the

24 principal spokes in the wheel that Congress always
25 understood to be there.

QUESTION;

Do you think that

10b(5) Cardon

1946 emptied the dockets?

MR. TOBOROFF:

I would say, first of all, the

4 commodity markets are a great deal different than the
5 security markets.

The security laws are the closest

6 analogue, and I agree to that, but I would say or I would
7 ask Lord knows how many manipulations in the securities
8 markets we would have if manipulators of those markets were
9 not responsible in United States courts.
10

I can't see any kind of a — if they had a

11 reparations provision under the securities laws, I would
12 presume that the same thing would happen there that is
13 happening here.

It is a limited, small claims type of

14 remedy that doesn’t reach the people like Simplot and
15 Taggares.

They go away scot free to do other manipulations

16 in other markets.

They are not liable to any redress from

17 the victims that they plucked, and if you affirm Judge
18 Friendly today, Simplot and Taggares, for instance, will not
19 manipulate another potato market.

Other manipulators of

20 soybeans, silver, porkbellies, orange juice, they won’t

21 manipulate those markets, because they will be subject to
22 the only true economic incentive redress that can be brought
23 to bear against him, and that is by the private litigant.

24

QUESTION;

Why then don’t these private litigant

25 suits stop manipulations?

QUESTION;

They saw all that going on and they

10 didn't express one word about creating a private right of
11 action.
12

MR. T0B0R0FF;

Because in 1974, when they sat down

13 to write the law, they had every reason to expect,
14 justifiably expect, and did justifiably expect that the
15 private right of action was in place.

Exchanges, brokers,

16 futures commission merchants asked them about it, and it
17 stayed in there.

All kinds of testimony

18 statement, I think, on September 9,

-- in the closing

1974, Chairman Talmadge,

19 the head of the Senate Committee, said that -- he was

20 talking about the various remedies that were provided by the
21 new Act.

He said, they will not interfere with the courts

22 in any way.

That alone, if you followed the recent

23 decisions of this Court, that alone seems to me to be fatal

24 to the proposition that there is not enough legislative
25 intent to find a private right of action here.

MR. TOBOROFF;

11

Ky point is, they applied a private

remedy in 1974 the way the private remedies were applied.

13

They couldn't know in 1974 that there would be the 1979

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 think Justice Rehnquist pointed out, in 1946 with the Cardon
2 case, and reached full flower with Borak, but if you take
3 Borak as the starting point, 1964, and go from Borak to Cort
4 against fish in 1975, those eleven years, you have those
5 eleven years, and you have a situation like the modern
6 statute, where you have a 50-year history, and where you
7 have an unbroken chain of decisions — whether they are
8 right or wrong, Congress is aware of those decisions, and
9 you have those two items when Congress sits down in those
10 eleven years.

It is a sui generis case.

It is just, as I

11 said, miles apart from the recent decisions.

This is the

12 only chance that the Court has to apply its standards to
13 this particular Act, naturally, because this is the only
14 case, these two cases, but -- these consolidated cases for
15 which I am arguing here have broader questions than simply

4 statute, I would be trying to stretch it to 1979, is what I
5 am saying, but I don't have to do that.

I got -- I am in

6 before Cort against Ash.
7

In conclusion, I would just like to emphasize that

8 the exchanges are here today really asking for a little bit
9 of judicial exculpation -- exculpation by way of judicial
10 legislation from something that Congress wouldn't give them
11 in 1974 when it switched its theory from self-regulation,
12 from fox in the chicken coop self-regulation to compulsory
13 regulation, and I think that based on all of the cases,
14 based on the standards as they exist today, enunciated here,
15 the Court has to conclude that Judge Friendly should be
16 affirmed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERARD K. SANDWEG, JR,. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

22

MR. SANDWEG;

23

Justice Stevens, you asked about the Deaktor

24 case.

Thank you, Your Honor.

I think it is important to this Court to understand

25 first, as has been ably pointed out, this Court's decision

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 had nothing to do with the private right of action

That wa

2 the Seventh Circuit's decision.
3

QUESTION;

It is true that the remand by this

4 Court wouldn't have made any sense unless this Court assumed
5 there was a private cause of action.
6

MR. SANDWEG*

It remanded it first to the agency

7 to determine whether or not it was an action, presumably
8 that would have followed from that remand.
9

QUESTION;

But it didn't order dismissal.

10

MR. SANDWEG;

It did not order dismissal.

That is

11 correct.

But the use of Deaktor here is to illuminate what

12 Congress knew when it enacted the 1974 Act, and our point is
13 that the 1974 Act and Congress's knowledge of Deaktor in
14 1974 is not relevant to this Court's inquiry about this.
15 The question here is what the Congress did in 1936 when it
16 enacted the operative language alleged to give rise to the
17 right of action.
18

When Deaktor was cited to the Court -- to the

19 Congress in 1974, it was not cited to Congress to show the
20 existence of a private right of action.

The purpose of it

21 being cited was to show the application of the antitrust
22 laws.

Thus, whatever the Seventh Circuit may have held, or

23 whatever the implications of this Court's decision may have
24 been, they do not give rise to Congressional knowledge in

25 1974 even if that knowledge were relevant, which we claim
