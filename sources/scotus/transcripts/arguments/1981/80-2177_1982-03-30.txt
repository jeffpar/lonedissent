ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN GUGGENHEIM, ESQ

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

9 please the Court*
10

The issue before the Court today is whether

11 there is federal habeas corpus jurisdiction to challenge
12 a termination of parental rights order where the
13 challenge is based upon the claim that the state court
14 lacked constitutional power to order the children into
15 state custody because the statute under which it
16 purported to act is federally unconstitutional.
17

A related question is whether the Petitioner,

18 as the mother who gave birth to the children who are now
19 wards of the state and nurtured them through their
20 formative years, has standing to challenge on their
21 behalf the allegedly unconstitutional order in this
22 case.
23
24 I thought;

QUESTION*

The question is a little narrower,

whether she can do it by way of habeas

25 corpus in a federal court.

Is it not that narrow?

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

Yes, related to the first

2 question of whether there is federal habeas corpus
3 jurisdiction, whether the Petitioner as the mother
4 before the final order of the Pennsylvania courts has

5 standing in the federal habeas action to bring this case
6 on the children's behalf.

7

This case does not present any question

8 respecting the scope of federal review in such a habeas

9 corpus action or concerning the relitigation of facts or
10 the best interests of the children.

11

The court below, the en banc Third Circuit,

12 ruled in a split decision, two plurality decisions of

13 that court, against Petitioner ; four interlocking,
14 interweaving, but we would submit mistaken bases for the
15 conclusion that jurisdiction does not lie in this case.
16

The first is that the mother does not have

17 legal capacity to bring the action on behalf of their
18 children.

The second is that the children are not in

19 custody within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus
20 statute.

The other two grounds are policy grounds:

the

21 fear that according such jurisdiction would necessarily
22 lead to including intra-family disputes, such as child

23 custody disputes in the ordinary separation of a family
24 divorce context; and the fourth, general federalism
25 concerns and implications respecting the appropriate

1

role of a federal court in determining constitutional

2

norms in this area.
He submit that there clearly is jurisdiction

3
4

in this case, that that jurisdiction derives from the

5

literal language and the purpose and meaning of Sections

6

224 1 and Section 2254 of Title 28.
The first issue for the court is whether the

7

8

children are in custody within the meaning of the

9

statute.

We submit that this Court has resolved that

10

question numerous times in the past.

11

course, it was the Act of 1867 which broadly expanded

12

the scope of federal habeas jurisdiction to all persons

13

in custody of the state in violation of the laws,

14

treaties or Constitution of the United States.

15

Historically, of

In 1886 this Court in Wales against Whitney

16

recognized that the term habeas, that the term custody,

17

is a term that applies to a great variety of restraints

18

for which it is used to get relief.

19

civil and criminal process may be so relieved.

20

wives restrained by husbands, children withheld from

21

their proper parent or guardian, persons held under

22

arbitrary custody by private individuals, may all become

23

proper subjects of habeas corpus.

24
25

Confinement under
Indeed,

Now, of course the question respecting the
definition and breadth of custody does not address

1

solely or conclude finally whether or not federal habeas

2 corpus lies.
3

But it clearly shows that the term

"custody" in the statute is easily met by children in

4 this case who are wards of the state.

QUESTION;

Mr. Guggenheim, what was the exact

14 position of the children at the time the habeas corpus

was brought?

Were they in the physical custody

state or were they in a foster home?

21 court which made them permanent wards of the state, at

QUESTION;

Would you say that habeas corpus

24 extended to the recovery of custody of children who were
25 already adopted?

MR. GUGGENHEIMi

1

In the brief we make the

2 point that there may well be equitable reasons to limit

3 habeas.

I think -- it’s a complicated answer.

I think

4 that jurisdiction does exist to make the challenge, but
5 I think that a court may determine that the children are
6 no longer in custody in violation of the Constitution.

QUESTION:

7

That would be a ruling on the

8 m erits.

9

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

No, no, not on the merits.

10

Even on the jurisdiction, after it made an inquiry into

11

where the children were at that moment.

12

is, Wales against Whitney, of course, as broad as the

And the reason

13 language is that I've just cited back in 1886 was, if
14 not reversed by this Court in Jones against Cunningham,
15 clearly broadly expanded in Jones against Cunningham,
16 and that the test in the twentieth century has been that
17 a person must be subject to restraints not shared by the
18 public generally.
19

There can be no question that children who are

20 state wards,
21

children who are parentless, children who

don’t have relatives, children who are subject to the

22 discretion of the state to be moved about within the

23 state's care, as this Court recognized in the Smith
24 against OFFER case, are persons who are restrained of
25 their liberty in a manner which is not shared by the

However, Justice Rehnguist, it may be — and

2
3

this case does not raise that guestion -- that once the

4

children have been adopted they no longer meet the test

5

of Jones against Cunningham, because they are no longer

6

subject to these peculiar restraints.

7

that they do still meet the test, and I would commmend

8

to this Court the Eighth Circuit's opinion in Syrovatka

QUESTION;

Where do you draw the line here?

than to be in your own home, on the word "restraint"?

15

Justice Blackmunn for this Court only last week in the

Well, on your theory if a husband

over the children, you could have — one could bring a

several times.

What I see

there from a quick look is that in order to make a case

25

for habeas in the federal court, you've got to show an

actual confinement of some kind.

Now, where is the actual confinement here?

3

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

Well, the actual -- but that

language follows from the very language which I read.

The Court has recognized that there is no satisfactory

definition -QUESTION;

8

What page of the opinion was that,

if you have it?
MR. GUGGENHEIM;

9

Unfortunately, I'm reading

10

from the Lawyer's Edition volume, and it's 279 of that

volume.

12

QUESTION;

Well, that case was a wholly

13

different case, in any event.

It was a naval officer

14

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

15

That's right, and the Court

16

found he was not confined.

17

overruled Wales in Jones against Cunningham.

18

point is that where it found the naval officer was not

19

confined, it found that wives and children were

20

confined.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

2

QUESTION:

3 analysis.

No, it did not.

So it's a totally different

The District of Columbia had full municipal

4 jurisdiction and this Court simply sat to review its
5 decision.
MR. GUGGENHEIM:

6

I’m not relying on the Hales

7 case to indicate that that naval officer was — had his
8 rights violated or vindicated, but only that this Court

9 has recognized in Jones against Cunningham again, that
10 at the common law both in English and American
11

term

usage the

"custody" — and I must emphasize that that’s not

12 dispositive of this case,

but only that the term

13 "custody" has always included children being held
14 wrongfully by third parties.
15

QUESTION:

Do you think Congress in

1967

16 intended to give the federal courts authority to review
17 court custody degrees?
18

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

Not ordinary court custody

19 decrees, because -- but yes, I do think Congress gave
20 the federal courts authority to
21

review this case.

As

this Court recognized in Ex parte McArdle and again in

22 cases within the last two decades,

the breadth of

23 federal habeas corpus was expanded by the

1867 Act as

24 far as constitutionally permissible to include -- and
25 what’s the test? -- all persons held in custody in

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

violation of the Constitution, laws and treaties of the

2

United States.
What -- and this now answers both your

3

4 question, Justice Rehnquist, and Chief Justice Burger’s
5 question.

Ordinary court custody decrees in the

6 ordinary intra-family dispute are not cognizable under
7

this statute, not because the children are not in

8

custody within the meaning of the law, but because the

9 children are not in custody in violation of the
10

Constitution.
That's what this Court held in In re Burrus

11

12 and

that’s what this Court held in Hatters against

13 Ryan.

In both cases, the Court recognized plainly that

14 the custody

requirement was met.

That's not what was

15 lacking.

But there is within the Jones against

16

17 Cunningham test yet another reason to conclude that
18 children

who are subject to one parent rather than

19 another’s custody is not in custody -- are not in
20 custody
21

within the meaning of the statute, because of

the Jones test, that they are not subject to restraints

22 not shared by
23

the public generally.

Children must live with one or another of

24 their parents.

If one parent to the dispute died, the

25 other parent would get custody automatically, and

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

certainly the children would be hard-pressed to claim

2

that the custody is in violation of the Constitution.
This is entirely different from court wards,

3
4

as these children are, entirely different.
QUESTION*

5

Well, what if there were an

6

allegation that the custody decree were entered without

7

due process of law?
HP. GUGGENHEIM*

8
9

Well, the kind of due process

of law that may raise the question might be the Culco

10

type case, where the court actually did not have

11

jurisdiction.

I can see that that --

12

QUESTION*

Or no fair hearing?

13

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

Well, no fair hearing — we

14

have the Court's analysis in the Flagg Brothers case,

15

where the Court recognized that private parties acting

16

pursuant to a statute -- every state has a statute that

17

says —

18

QUESTION;

I'm talking about a judicial

19

proceeding which ends up with awarding a child to one

20

parent or the other, and the one who didn't get the

21

child says that the proceeding was conducted in

22

violation of the United States Constitution.

23

MR. GUGGENHEIM*

Several federal courts have

24

allowed that jurisdiction, have found jurisdiction

25

exists in such a case, but summarily find that the claim

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is frivolous.

QUESTION;

2
3

In almost every case -What I'm trying to find out is,

does the theory of your case encompass that claim?
HR. GUGGENHEIM;

4

The Court could interpret the

5

Jones against Cunningham test of restraints not shared

6

by the public generally to find that even where -- and

7

the difference is that we're not focusing on the in

8

violation of the Constitution clause.

9

the custody.

Let's go back to

Maybe they're not in custody within the

10

meaning of the federal statute, because the Court in

11

Jones defined that test in a way that fits very nicely

12

with this case.
If a colorable claim were made that they are

13
14

something in violation of the Constitution, I suppose

15

that's for a federal court to determine.

16

17

But there are

Well, take -- suppose in this very

18

case this had proceeded all the way to an adoption, but

last week in Santosky, was based on a preponderance

21

rather than a clear and convincing evidence test.

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

I might turn the question

ask, how could we seriously claim that a

24 person who is merely on parole,
25 make a visit with a

that periodically has to

parole officer -- or if we move on

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to Carafas against LaVallee or the other cases where

2

this Court has broadly expanded the term "custody" -- in

3 Strait against Laird, the reservist who has to report
4 for some future armed services duty.
5

In Carafas the Court found that the

6 disabilities of engaging in a type of business, of

7 voting, of serving as a labor official or a juror was a
8 sufficient restraint.

The answer is, how are the

9 children restrained of their liberty;

the state and not

10

the parent is empowered to consent to their marriage by

11

the statute.

12

2521, provides that the parent -- that the state and not

23 Consolidated Pennsylvania Laws, Section

13 the parent shall consent to the enlistment in the armed
14 forces, that the state and not the parent shall consent
15 to the major medical, psychiatric and surgical
16 treatment, and that the state and not the parent shall
17 exercise such other authority concerning the child as a
18 natural parent should exercise.
19

In short, as Justice Marshall indicated, it is

20 the totality of restraint, of conditions on the child
21

imposed by the state, which makes that person’s liberty

22 different from that which the public shares generally,

23 even other children.

7 adjudication that they're challenging.
8

MR. GREEVY;

9

QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor.
How do you answer that?

10

MR. GREEVY;

I think that it brings up a

11

question that certainly after a

termination there’s a

12 realignment of interests, and in a real sense perhaps a

13 child needs a voice in that termination decision.

The

14 argument we would make is that in delinquency cases,
15 which certainly the Court has recognized through habeas
16 corpus, the parent and the child would share an interest
17 either in a release from probation or release from even
18 the supervision of a probation officer, or in an extreme
19 case the child being held in an institution.
20
21

The child's need of continuity conflicts with
this absence of finality when a termination is

22 questioned and, as in this case, appealed.

23

Now, in Pennsylvania under the new 1980

24 statute representation through a guardian ad litem is
25 given to a child in an involuntary termination matter.

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Heretofore, and certainly in this case, the agency was

2

overseeing the interests of the child in stability and a

3 long-term foster care.
4

The second question would deal, of course,

5 directly with habeas corpus.
6

The stamp of criminal

sanctions certainly pervades the overwhelming majority

7 of habeas corpus petitions which are filed in the
8

federal courts.

Indeed, Attorney General William French

9 Smith noted that last year alone there were 7800 habeas
10

11
12

petitions filed in the federal courts.
These issues in regards to state criminal
matters indicate the judicial and social perception of

13 the scope of the great writ, sweeps aside, of course,
14 the doctrine of res judicata, with no restriction or
15 perhaps even a statute of limitation in which the
16 petition can be filed.

The statute looks to the

17 protection of individuals against the erosion of their
18 private rights.

Certainly, it provides relief from

19 unlawful custody, as was noted in the several criminal
20
21

22

cases discussed by Hr. Guggenheim.
Simply stated, a single federal judge can
overturn the highest court of a state as it relates to

23 constitutional issues and the direct facts of the case.
24 The question is whether the restraints are suffered by
25 the public generally, which was discussed in the Hensley

Congress found it appropriate to tailor this

3

present habeas corpus statute to meet an existing need

4

and concern back in 1867.

5

that a major shifting in interpretation such as

6

advocated by Marjorie Lehman perhaps should await some

7

Congressional thought on the matter.

8

there’s been some suggestions made by Attorney General

9

Smith that the habeas corpus area should be approached

It can be justifiably argued

Indeed, I think

10

and discussed by Congress and decided what direction

11

they opt for here in our common age.
Justices Brennan, Marshall and O'Connor in the

12
13

Fair Assessment case talked about that, subject only to

14

constitutional restraints, Congress exclusively

15

determines the jurisdiction of federal courts.

16

Pennsylvania statute was found not -- was found

17

constitutional back in 1978, and that has been embedded

18

in the law since.

The

Simply put, the wrongful restraint which is

19

20

talked about in habeas corpus is simply not the

21

circumstance when we’re dealing with rights termination

22 matters.

Parents' interests remain most strong in

23

preserving the family relationship after termination.

As we've talked, the child's right is in an end to that

25

litigation, the right to then be accepted into a stable

So really, then, the

9 answer is in your view 1983 wouldn't really be an
10

adequate remedy.

11

MR. GREEVY:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GREEVY:

14

QUESTION:

Remedy in this matter -No.
-- it would not be.
Certainly in a number of cases,

15 such as Huffman against Pursue and Younger against
16 Harris, we’ve held that it's a perfectly adequate
17 federal remedy to have the right, ultimate right of
18 review here from a

state proceeding.

19

MR. GREEVY:

20

Another issue raised by Mr. Guggenheim is that

21

That is correct.

the granting of jurisdiction under the habeas corpus

22 would not open the gates to a full range of other

23 cases.

It is my strong belief that it would open the

24 case for private litigants in particular fact
25 circumstances where the federal court would be looking

36

1

to constitutional issues, that we would have private

2

litigating parties continuing to fight while there was

3

still a forum that would hear their argument, which is

4

easily borne out in this Lehman matter.
Certainly, a core issue as recognized by the

5

6

Third Circuit and herein would be the question of

7

federal-court relationships.

8

the principle of comity refers to the proper respect for

9

state functions that organs of the national government,

As recognized this term,

10

most particularly the federal states, are expected to

11

demonstrate in the exercise of their own legitimate

12

powers.

13

Justice Rehnquist last week in Santosky stated

14

that family law has been left to the states since time

15

immemorial, and not without good reason.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, you're not apt to get very

far if you rely on dissenting opinions.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. GREEVY:

20

Your Honor, that --

21

QUESTION:

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. GREEVY:

But certainly it -- but note,

It depends on whose dissent.

The issues here certainly are

24

very close, and certainly it is a matter that the Court

25

has to look to.

Certainly, it's been often cited that

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the whole subject of domestic relations belongs with the

2 state courts.

They have the historic -- they've

3 historically decided the issues, they've developed
4 well-known expertise, and they have a strong interest in
5 disposing of the issues.
6

I think that Santosky does note --

7

QUESTION;

8

HP. GREEVY;

9 overruled.

Then you want Santosky overruled?
I'm not saying that it should be

In fact, Your Honor, I was very happy to see

10

that the Lehman case was cited in the Santosky

11

decision.

I believe that what Santosky does, does state

12 to us, is that this Court has given some guidelines.

13 They've indicated that there is concern when the family
14 is involved, not only natural parents but foster
15 parents.
16

You said last term in Lassiter that the

17 guestion of lawyers can be decided on a case by case,
18 but very firmly said that when you're looking to the
19 burden of proof look to clear and convincing, put the
20 presumption
21

with the parents.

Pennsylvania has used the clear and

22 convincing.

Examination of the -- even the orphans

23 court decision back in June of

'76, Judge Roupt very

24 strongly stated that he was — in fact, the only case
25 cited at the case is a case cited in my brief, In re

38

1

Geiger, which holds the clear and convincing burden

2

necessary.

3
4

Now that this Court has spoken to these issues
regarding family matters, I believe that this Court can

5 step back, perhaps is the word, and let the states
6 administer these cases, see how the states do with it.
7 There is certainly an overview by this Court, not only
8

through the direct appeal but through 1983 in

9

appropriate circumstances.
Let’s give the states a chance to determine

10
11

how they are going to administer their statutes.

Don't

12

impose the intrusive nature of habeas corpus into this

13

area.

14

I'd like to conclude that if this case was

15

ripe for decision on its merits, then it was in 1978

16

when this Petitioner chose not to exercise her direct

17

right of appeal .

18

at that apple through the collateral remedy by

19

establishing federal habeas corpus jurisdiction.

20

She should not be given a second bite

This Court has the opportunity to speak very

21

firmly to the balancing of parental and child interests

22

in this matter by retaining the present basis of habeas

23

corpus jurisdiction.

24

decision will promote finality and stability in the

25

realm of children's rights.

1

Mr. Greevy, I suppose you can lose

That is, if the Court were to assume

there was habeas corpus jurisdiction, you could still

win the case?

MR. GREEVY:

MR. GREEVY:

the issues here.

In what manner. Your Honor?
Well, as a matter of -Yes, we could.

Custody is one of

But this Court can decide that,

10

regardless of the literal interpretation of this

11

statute, that there are other reasons why this Court

12

should refrain from extending the habeas corpus

statute.

QUESTION;

15

MR. GREEVY;

16
17

Prudential reasons.
Right.

Policy, as Mr. Guggenheim

noted.
The Court can help to guard against the

18

preservation of a child's uneas y status quo and the

19

limbo of foster care.

We submi t that, based upon the

20 very thorough and strongly held First and Third Circuit
21

positions, this Court should re ject this extension of

22 habeas corpus statutes into the parental rights
23

termination area of family law, which is controlled and

24

administered by the states.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

7

Do you have anything further, Mr. Guggenheim?

8

9

Thank you.

You have two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN GUGGENHEIM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10
11

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

Thank you.

12

This case is the paradigm of state action.

13 It's state-initiated proceedings which result in ongoing
14 state custody.

It may be that the prudential concern of

15 this Court is in defining custody so it does not include
16 people already adopted.

But there are strong policy

17 reasons for a boy like Frank, whose rights were
18 terminated for no reason, who never was going to be
19 adopted and never has been adopted, to have the
20 opportunity for federal review at some level.
21

This Court, however, has never countenanced

He had it, did he not, in

1

ME. GUGGENHEIM;

He had the opportunity for it

2 and it was only a cert petition.
3

QUESTION;

For strategic reasons, you decided

4 to forego that.
5

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

Basically, and for the

6 complication that there was an as-applied and a facial
7 attack in the case, and only one of them would be
8 cognizable on direct appeal.
9

This is a challenge to the constitutionality

10 of a state statute.

It is, in Justice Powell's words in

11 Stone against Powell, going to the heart of guilt or
12 innocence.

It's not an extra question.

In Justice

13 Stevens' words in Rose against Lundy, this is his fourth
14 kind of habeas claim.

It goes to the validity of the

15 judgment.

16

This Court has never countenanced the denial

17 of Congressionally imposed jurisdiction for policy or
18 prudential reasons.

Stone is the limit of this Court

19 interpreting what the meaning of "in violation of the
20 Constitution" was, to say that the illegal search didn't
21 meet that test.
22

But it has never gone beyond that.

And finally, this Court — the court below,

23 the majority of the Third Circuit judges believed that
24 federal review was appropriate and was necessary, but
25 peculiarly, thought it was better to reserve the federal

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

issues, contrary to Congress' desire of exhaustion in

2 the England type context, to reserve; in the first
3

place, litigate through the state court, then go into

4 federal
5

court in 1983 and say the statute's

unconstitutional.
I submit that is not respecting basic

6
7

principles of comity.

That is showing a greater

8 disregard for the intelligence and concern
9
10

judges than to require, as the habeas statute does, full
exhaustion of the remedies in the first place.
And finally, although I won't refer to a

11

12 dissent to rely on
13

it solely, all of the Justices of

this Court in the Santosky case recognized that federal

14 courts should
