ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. SUSAN GAMBLE SMATHERS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MRS. SMATHERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It is respectfully submitted that the central

11

issue involved in this petition is whether the federal

12

courts below exceeded the bounds of their constitutional

13

authority attesting the validity of an apparently sufficient

14

contract which was the basis for the state's assertion of

15

sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.

16

We submit that the court's authority is limited to

17

determining whether the state has an genuine interest in the

18

subject matter of a dispute, and that once the state's

19

interest is demonstrated, even though there may be defenses

20

that may be asserted in another forum, that the inquiry of

21

the federal court should cease.

22

This Court does not sit today to decide the merits

23

of the parties' contractual dispute; rather, the people of

24

the State of Florida deserve to have a dispute over the

25

ownership of historic artifacts, on display in many

instances in their state museum, decided in a state court

2

which is fully equipped to hear the issue and which, it must

3

be assumed, can reach a decision which meets the ends of

4

justice.

5

Briefly, the facts are in 1622 a flotilla of 28

6

Spanish ships was proceeding through the Florida straits and

7

encountered a hurricane.

8

of the ships, which was not subsequently recovered by the

9

Spaniards, was the Nuestra Senora de Atocha.

Eight of the ships were lost.

One

She went down

10

with a precious metal cargo as well as a vast amount of

11

artifacts from the 17th century which today may be worth as

12

much as $400 million.

13

significance of those artificacts could have no price tag

14

put on them.

15

Certainly the archaeological

In 1971 under the authority of Florida's

16

antiquities legislation the State of Florida Department of

17

State entered into a contract with Respondents to search for

18

and later recover the remains of the Atocha.

19

contract the state was to retain 25 percent of the artifacts

20

recovered, and the Respondents were to be paid in kind for

21

their services consisting of 75 percent of the artifacts.

22

Then in March 1975 United States v. Florida was

23

handed down which re-established Florida's boundaries for

24

purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.

25

that Respondents filed an in rem complaint in admiralty in

What is important for this Court to understand was

that Respondents' in rem complaint sought possession and

title to the unidentified remains of a vessel which were

Florida was not a party to that proceeding.
QUESTION:

Why was Florida not a party to it?

10

MRS. SMATHERS:

QUESTION:

12

The artifacts in

There was a conscious decision not to

intervene on the part of the state.
MRS. SMATHERS:

It was a policy

waters was drawn seriously in question.

Certainly the state recognized that their

It was convenient to get the United

States in.
MRS. SMATHERS:

Certainly.

The United States did

intervene in that proceeding and claimed ownership of the

21

wreck under the Federal Antiquities Act and the Abandoned

22

Properties Act.

23

dispute between the United States and Florida as to who

24

could exercise ownership or control of these artifacts.

There had never before this time been any

The United States intervened, as I said, and

8

Did the United States intervene at the

You can't give me an assurance as to

that answer, however.
MRS. SMATHERS:

9

Well, I would say no.

I will say

10

that all of the parties, including the Respondents, met in

11

Washington sometime before the initiation of these suits to

12

talk about the wrecks, to talk about who would own them and

13

to try to work out some agreement over who could salvage the

14

wrecks.

15

their complaint in rem in the Southern District Court for

16

possession and title.

17

At some point that broke down and Respondents filed

But as I say, that in rem complaint sought

18

ownership of that which had not even been raised yet.

The

19

ownership of these artifacts was not in question in that

20

proceeding.

intervene in the proceeding because the artifacts under

fact being worked on in the state laboratory, in some cases

25

already on display, those artifacts were not in dispute.

QUESTION:

And how did they come into the

possession of the states, Mrs. Smathers?
MRS. SMATHERS:

3

They came into possession under

4

the contracts in which both parties agreed at that time that

5

the Atocha lay on sovereignty submerged lands owned by the

6

State of Florida.

7

QUESTION:

So this is only that portion which to

8

that time had been recovered?
MRS. SMATHERS:

9

QUESTION:

10

That is right, Your Honor.

And the state got 25 percent and

11

Respondents kept 75 percent of it?

12

MRS. SMATHERS:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.

You say in the original libel the

14

artifacts which had been distributed to Florida or were to

15

be distributed to the State of Florida were not -- their

16

title was not challenged?
MRS. SMATHERS:

17

No, Your Honor.

And,

in fact, the

18

Fifth Circuit when it affirmed that case or affirmed the

19

trial court holding as between Treasure Salvors and the

20

United States, expressly held that we do not approve that

21

portion of the trial court's order which held that

22

Respondents had title against all the world.

23

address any rights of ownership as to parties which are not

24

before us.

25

We do not

And that's very clear in their opinion.
QUESTION:

to Justice Brennan?

2

MRS. SMATHERS:

3

QUESTION:

Certainly.

He asked whether the Respondents kept

4

75 percent.

Wasn't there a time when the State of Florida

5

had possession of all of them?
MRS. SMATHERS:

6

No, Your Honor, unless by the fact

7

that the Respondents were a contracting party with the

8

state.

9

principal I suppose you could say that we had possession of

By virtue that the State of Florida was their

10

all of them.

However, the state had an agent on board the

11

vessel at the time that all of these artifacts were

12

recovered, and divisions were to be conducted under the

13

contracts at different times, periodically at mutually

14

agreed upon times.
QUESTION:

15

Is there not an implication in the

16

papers, however, that Florida's release of 75 percent of

17

them was with some reluctance?
MRS. SMATHERS:

18

There may be that allegation, Your

Honor, but it's strongly contested by the state.

made on that basis.

3

QUESTION:

I have one more question, and it may be

4

irrelevant to your basic legal argument, but there is an

5

inference also in the papers that the contract was made

6

under threat of arrest.
MRS. SMATHERS:

7

Is this correct?
Well, certainly at that time it

8

was the State of Florida's belief that they had absolute

9

control and ownership over that area, and if Respondents

10

were found to have been salvaging in an area without a

11

contract, yes, they would have been arrested.

QUESTION:

14

That was the

And you think it's a valid contract

then.
MRS. SMATHERS:

15

I think that whether or not it's a

16

valid contract should be decided in a state court.

17

a vast amount of contract jurisprudence in the State of

18

Florida which a state court is certainly willing and able to

19

decide.

20

parties' dispute was a recision of the contract based on a

21

mistake of fact or it could be argued a mistake of law, then

22

that dispute is certainly to be determined in a state court.

23

We have

QUESTION:

May I ask a question at this point?

24

With respect to those artifacts that are in Florida's

25

possession is it Florida's position that those belong

entirely to the state or they're to be shared 75/25?
MRS. SMATHERS:

2

No.

That is their share.

They

3

only have 25 percent of the artifacts which they recovered

4

pursuant to four years of contracts with the Respondents.
QUESTION:

5

I'm still not sure I understand what

you're telling me.

in their possession represent 25 percent of the total, is

8

that it, and therefore -MRS. SMATHERS:

9
10

You're saying that those which they have

Twenty-five percent of what had

been recovered up to that time, yes.
QUESTION:

11

Of those which were originally

12

delivered to Florida, Florida has only retained 25 percent

13

of those.

14

MRS. SMATHERS:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That is absolutely correct.

Has Florida instituted any litigation

in state courts to resolve any of these issues?
MRS. SMATHERS:

No, they have not, although it has

18

been contemplated and in fact gone so far as to have

19

complaints drawn up.

They have not to date.

20

QUESTION:

But nothing has been filed.

21

MRS. SMATHERS:

22

QUESTION:

No.

And what is the relative proportion of

23

what's been recovered and is in Florida's possession as

24

opposed to what remains -- I guess some is still in the

25

ocean, isn't it?

No.

Well, what is the

value of what remains?
MRS. SMATHERS:

The total, including what's in

12

dispute today as well as that which is still in the ocean,

13

could be as much as $400 million.

14
15

QUESTION:

So that the major portion of what may

have been on the Spanish ship is not in dispute here.

16

MRS. SMATHERS:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's right.

And Florida has made no claim to that

either in the state court or elsewhere.

19

MRS. SMATHERS:

20

QUESTION:

Not yet.

Well, the contract, I gather, covers

21

that, too, doesn't it?

22

Respondents covers, does it, what's still in the ocean?

MRS. SMATHERS:

The contract Florida made with

Well, the parties quit dealing in

1975 right after U.S. v. Florida came down.
QUESTION:

Are you telling me then that what's

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

2

MRS. SMATHERS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MRS. SMATHERS:

That's right.

I see.
Treasure Salvors, the Respondents,

5

have continued to work on the wreck site, and what they

6

brought up is presumably in their possession.

7

QUESTION:

But if the argument you make in the

8

last part of your brief is valid, Florida would have a claim

9

to all that, wouldn't it?

10

MRS. SMATHERS:

Your Honor, we make that argument

11

to show that at least we had a colorable claim to those

12

artifacts, at least it didn't deserve to be dismissed in so

13

cavalier a fashion as to say well --

14

QUESTION:

Well, but apparently notwithstanding

15

the immense amount of value there, it's not a claim that has

16

enough merit to have persuaded you even to institute a

17

lawsuit to assert it.

18

MRS. SMATHERS:

It was a policy decision made by

19

the state at that time, made by the administration of the

20

Department of State not to pursue it until the issue had

21

been clearly settled.

22

Submerged Lands Act that -- or at least we could make the

23

argument that the Submerged Lands Act applies to natural

24

resources and that the state may in fact be able to continue

25

to exercise jurisdiction in those waters.

We would argue that under the

QUESTION:

Aren't you a little worried about

whether you do have -- that that is in your waters?

3

MRS. SMATHERS:

4

in dispute in this case.

5

QUESTION:

6

MRS. SMATHERS:

Certainly, but that's not what's

Is that why you didn't file the lawsuit?
That is exactly right.

I concede

7

that there is a question as to whether the Atocha lies in

8

Florida waters or not, but I would also make the argument

9

that these parties contracted on the basis of the state's

10

constitutional boundaries as they were in 1868 when Florida

11

was readmitted to the Union, which boundaries Congress

12

approved in order to be readmitted, and that it was the

13

Submerged Lands Act which has some very specific language

14

that compelled the Special Master to draw an insular pocket

15

of jurisdiction around the Dry Tortugas Islands and then to

16

draw a line over here around the end of the Keys, and to

17

hold that under the Submerged Lands Act that Florida could

18

not own the land in between those two pieces of territory

19

because of the three mile-three league provision in the

20

Submerged Lands Act.

21

But the boundaries is not something that we

22

dreamed up for purposes of salvaging the Atocha; in fact,

23

the state's constitution today, if you look at a geodetic

24

map it's going to show that the state's boundaries go all

25

the way from the Marquesas Keys all the way and including
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the waters in between the Marquesas and the Dry Tortugas,

2

which is where the Atocha is found.
QUESTION:

3

May I ask one other question?

4

Supposing your maritime people who were going to make the

5

arrests before this whole thing got started went out and

6

used self-help to go start taking some of these things off

7

the bottom of the ocean themselves, and your adversaries

8

then sought an injunction to force them to stop.

9

have an Eleventh Amendment defense to that injunction action?
MRS. SMATHERS:

10

Would you

I would think that under Alabama

11

v. Pugh we would have a defense if the State of Florida was

12

the party or if the State of Florida Department of State was

13

a party.

14

official, perhaps under many cases in this Court it would

15

lie.

16

was between the State of Florida Department of State and the

17

Respondents.

18

State or by the Director of the Division of Archives.

Had it been an injunction against a specific

However, the contract entered into by these parties

It wasn't entered into by the Secretary of

And I think that what the court has held below, or

19

20

it certainly could be construed in the future to hold that

21

if a party wants to rescind a contract or if they want to

22

question the state's title to property, that they can now go

23

into federal court and do that if they win or if the federal

24

court is persuaded that they may have the more persuasive

25

argument.

But under the Eleventh Amendment we have a right
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

to assert a losing argument in state court.
And Judge Rubin below in dissent expressed it very

3

well when he said that the rule now of the majority is that

4

suits against the state are permitted by the Eleventh

5

Amendment if the result is that the state loses.

6

that's going much further than any of the cases of this

7

Court have indicated.

8

decision, while these facts are not covered by the Edelman

9

decision, Edelman did state that the Eleventh Amendment

I think

And certainly in the Edelman

10

declares a policy of such compelling force that it is an

11

explicit limitation on federal courts.

12

thinking and that policy we think that the court in this

13

case overstepped the bounds of its inquiry.

14

And in light of that

The court below justified its position that the

15

Eleventh Amendment did not apply to the dispute based upon

16

its reading of a 1921 decision In re New York, and the court

17

below took this decision to mean that the Eleventh Amendment

18

is merely a rebuttable presumption which may be defeated

19

upon a showing of facts that it believed can refute a claim

20

of state ownership of property.

21

In re New York held that the verified suggestion

22

of ownership filed by New York's Attorney General as to

23

state ownership of a tugboat in that case was sufficient

24

evidence of state ownership to trigger the Eleventh

25

Amendment, at least in the absence of a special challenge.
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It was the special challenge language that allowed the Fifth

2

Circuit to infer that had the plaintiff in that case

3

presented a genuine controversy as to the ownership of the

4

tugboat that the court would have been obliged to take

5

jurisdiction and hear the case.

6

We submit that In re New York holds, and it is the

7

state of the law, that a court may initially examine a claim

8

of state involvement to determine whether a state's being

9

genuinely sued in a case; but that once the state's presence

10

is discovered, the suit must be dismissed for lack of

11

jurisdiction.
We would also submit that the reasoning, this

12
13

rebuttable presumption argument, simply begs the

14

jurisdictional question in the most fundamental way, since

15

all it does is allow the plaintiff to reassert his position

16

on the merits, the Eleventh Amendment notwithstanding.
QUESTION:

17
18

Are you familiar with United States v.

Lee?

19

MRS. SMATHERS:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

If the defendants in that case had been

21

state officials and the issue was the title to state

22

property would the case have come out differently?
MRS. SMATHERS:

23
24
25

I think that is possible.

I think

that -QUESTION:

Possible.

MRS. SMATHERS:

QUESTION:

5

Because in this case --

Is it because it's just a sovereign

immunity case, or is it -MRS. SMATHERS:

The reason U.S. v. Lee is not

applicable is because the order to show cause, the trial

way out that this was just against state officials.

14

MRS. SMATHERS:

15

QUESTION:

No.

They said even if it's against the

16

state, the Eleventh Amendment doesn't bar it because at the

outset you have a jurisdictional question, namely the merits.

the Court:

Now, the wreck of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha was

found after three years of search by Treasure Salvors, and

11

as previously determined by this Court, it was outside the

territorial boundaries of the United States and that of

13

Florida.

14

The factual findings of the trial court have for

and the United States were working secretly in 1975 to

by Treasure Salvors four years before.

When these covert activities were discovered,

Treasure Salvors filed its in rem action against the Atocha,

20

and this Court ruled on Florida's boundaries in U.S. v.

21

Florida, and the state rushed at that point, knowing that it

was losing, under its contract which said that we had the

23

right to do out and salvage on state-owned sovereign

24

submerged lands if we paid them $1,200 a year, the state at

that time rushed to divide much of the salvaged treasure.

But they were only dividing -- they had everything that we

2

had recovered.

3

asked for a division over and over and over again.

They had never given us a division.

We had

And they talk about these series of contracts.

4
5

The reason there was a series of contracts is that there was

6

a total forfeiture provision if we stopped short of a total

7

recovery; so we had no option but to continue the salvage.

8

And then with their plan -- and the trial court found that

9

this was an ongoing plan to keep all of it, and that was a

10

factual finding of the trial court after the evidentiary

11

hearing.

12

But what happened was one week prior to this Court

13

issuing its opinion, after the oral arguments and after they

14

went back and said boy, we just got cleaned, the state

15

rushed to try this division; but they only divided about 80

16

percent of what was up there, and they kept the rest.
Now,

17

frustrated in its desire to obtain the entire

18

treasure, the state encouraged and worked with the United

19

States to claim everything, past, present, and future.

20

There were negotiations which Mike Reed talks about in the

21

San Diego Law Review, the Assistant Solicitor of the United

22

States, when the State of Florida comes up and says hey,

23

listen, we've lost this thing; you've got to protect our

24

interest.

25

Now, after extensive evidentiary hearings the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

trial court found that the state chose not to enter a claim

2

but to rely upon the United States to win the suit.

3

they even went so far as to decide how they were going to

4

divide up the spoils once the United States won.
QUESTION:

5

6

And

Well, does that really bear on the

Eleventh Amendment issue?
MR. HORAN:

7

Yes, it does, because there is no

8

Eleventh Amendment, Justice Rehnquist, if it's between the

9

United States and Florida.

10

See, the United States came in

and claimed --

11

QUESTION:

I realize that.

12

MR. HORAN:

And so certainly there would be no

13

Eleventh Amendment; if the United States had won their claim

14

saying they were the owner, then they'd have come down and

15

just said okay, that's ours.
QUESTION:

16

No.

The Eleventh Amendment is strictly

17

a defense between a state and an individual; but I take it

18

Florida has sought to assert it here, and the Court of

19

Appeals has said it can't.
MR. HORAN:

20

Right.

The factual assertion or the

21

factual finding of the trial court that the State of Florida

22

was in privity with the United States puts it foreclosed,

23

because at that point the United States was urging Florida's

24

claim.

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that's what the

Court of Appeals rested on?
MR. HORAN:

2

No, sir.

The Court of Appeals rested

3

primarily on the fact that the court must have jurisdiction

4

at least to find out the propriety of the claim being put

5

forward, and that's why U.S. v. Lee is so much on point.
The state, after all this litigation, tremendous

that the title to all past salvage was being litigated in

bound for failing to intervene and its participation in the

previous litigation.

14

of the state's entanglement and reliance on the federal

government in this case quite simply serves to highlight the

fact that equitable principles call for the division to be

the state's argument does not even dispute or

even discuss in the entire reply brief that the wreck is

It does not dispute the Florida Statute 267 only applies to

wrecks on state-owned lands, nor do they dispute that the

invalid on five separate grounds, nor do they dispute that

the salvaged articles had been forcefully taken by state

agents who were not entitled to ownership or possession.

MR. HORAN:

wasn't even raised that there was a problem with ownership

QUESTION:

You draw from that a negative

2

implication that if there were a special challenge, the

3

Court would have not followed the doctrine of Queen City?

4
5
6

MR. HORAN:

I do, and that's exactly what the

trial court and the Fifth Circuit so held.
QUESTION:

As I read Queen City it was more an

7

application of principles traditionally applicable to

8

municipal corporations, and saying that even if you're a

9

municipal corporation not protected by the Eleventh

10

Amendment, you are still not subject to this sort of a libel

11

and admiralty; and then saying if it's true of municipal

12

corporations it's true of a fortiori of the state.

13

MR. HORAN:

Certainly.

I read the Queen City

14

cases very similarly to say that ownership is the pivotal

15

issue on whether the Eleventh Amendment applies, and if

16

there is a showing of ownership, then the Eleventh Amendment

17

is going to apply.

18

But that is a jurisdictional fact.

There is a little bit of a difference between

19

sovereign immunity of a foreign state and the Eleventh

20

Amendment, but in both of these there are similarities in

21

both of them.

2

wrongfully, as they did in Lee -QUESTION:

3

Would you say that a colorable claim to

4

ownership would suffice for jurisdictional purposes, just a

5

colorable claim?
MR. HORAN:

Well, I would say this.

I would say

7

that the colorable claim, if there is a challenge -- now,

8

the colorable claim, we're not talking about getting into

9

the whole litigation at this point.

We're talking about

10

whether it applies, and the Court's making this

11

jurisdictional fact determination of jurisdiction.
At that point I think that when the state came up

12
13

and said here we have a contract, the federal court is not -QUESTION:

14
15

But answer in the abstract, if you

would, without reference to these disturbing facts.
MR. HORAN:

16

Okay.

If you come up and you say

17

okay, this property which is in the possession, and you

18

allege in the wrongful possession, of these state agents

19

here and that you own it, now this property here belongs to

20

the state and here's a contract, and it says that the

21

property belongs to the state, and the court looks at that

22

contract.
Now, I don't think that the court has to put on

23
24

blinders.

I think when the first paragraph of the contract

25

says something which is just completely outrageous like we

I think

22

that what the Court of Appeals, and what I'm insisting on is

23

that Florida's unsupported claim of ownership is at best

clothed with the presumption of validity that if duly

25

challenged and rebutted cannot operate as a jurisdictional

Because Florida's claim of ownership was duly

2

challenged, the question of ownership was a jurisdictional

3

matter to be judicially resolved on evidence to be presented.
Now,

4

in this matter the state has not even

5

attacked the trial court's findings of fact which

6

overwhelmingly controvert the state's claim of ownership.
QUESTION:

7

Before you can reach the claim of

8

ownership don't you have to -- a question of ownership, as

9

you put it, a jurisdictional matter, don't you have to

10

surmount the Eleventh Amendment?
MR. HORAN:

11

I don't believe so, because I think

12

the Eleventh Amendment turns on the ownership argument.

If

13

it is not owned by the state,

14

by the state, there is no Eleventh Amendment argument.

said you're in possession of that property, and they said

Well, in the Tinsdale case the only difference is

21

that instead of pursuing all the way through the litigation

22

like Florida did, in Tinsdale the state came in and filed an

QUESTION:

Well, as I read the findings of the

District Court, the District Court said that the property

was in the possession of a certain named department of the

state government.

That's what he found.

Nevertheless, the court said it's in

possession of the state.
MR. HORAN:

Okay.

Without conceding the

constitutionality of Florida statute, the case resembles and

is on point with a case that was decided 14 years before

this Court decided Ex parte Young, and that was Reagan v.

hold that the mere assertion of title in the state bars

Now, the issue here, as in Tinsdale, is whether

there is an action brought against individuals to recover

the possession of land which they have in their possession

QUESTION:

1

Are you saying that the equities,

2

whatever they may be in this case, are irrelevant to the

3

issue that's now before us?
MRS. SMATHERS:

4

That is precisely what I'm saying,

5

Your Honor.

And I would also say that they made the claim

6

that we didn't controvert the facts found by the District

7

Court.

metallurgists and chemists and illustrators and

We certainly did, and we happen to be stuck with the

every time they read it.

12

And we did controvert the allegations made.

The

13

findings were made against us.

is whether the federal court can try a suit to rescind a

15

contract and then decide whether the Eleventh Amendment

16

applies to the case.

17

19

QUESTION:

But the issue in this case

Could I ask you what the first response

of Florida was to the service of this writ?
MRS. SMATHERS:

Gladly.

Florida filed a motion to

20

quash the warrant for arrest in rem based also on another

21

jurisdictional challenge which was the fact that the

22

property did not lie within the territorial jurisdiction of

23

the Southern District Court.

24
25

We lost on that.

The trial court denied our

motion to quash, and then it ordered the State of Florida to
43

show cause why the property held in its possession should

2

not be turned over to the substitute custodians, the

3

Respondents.
The State of Florida, not L. Ross Morrell, not the

4
5

Secretary of State himself, not the Governor, the State of

6

Florida owned the property.

7

had to come in and say we own this property, we have a

8

contract, and the dispute should be heard in federal court.
We may not have asserted the Eleventh Amendment in

That's why the State of Florida

QUESTION:

Your first response to the order to

2

show cause as to why the state shouldn't turn over the

3

property did not contain the Eleventh Amendment.

4

MRS. SMATHERS:

That is correct.

But we take the

5

position that the Edelman case as well as the Ford Motor

6

Company case recognized that a state could come and try the

7

entire action, go through an entire lawsuit, go through an

8

appeal, and not even assert the Eleventh Amendment until it

9

got to the Supreme Court of the United States.

10

QUESTION:

Because it is a jurisdictional matter.

11

MRS. SMATHERS:

12

QUESTION:

That's right, and it's not waived.

But let me ask you.

Supposing you'd

13

thought about the Eleventh Amendment when your two officials

received the process.

15

Eleventh Amendment as a defense.

without alleging that the state owned the property.

You then decided to assert the

17

MRS. SMATHERS:

Could you have merely said these are

state officials; they work for the State of Florida;

this process.

I'm just asking

6

in your view what did you have to do to prevent the federal

7

court -- say you did it as fast as you possibly could --

8

from asserting jurisdiction over these two individuals?

9

What kind of a pleading would you have had to file?

10

MRS. SMATHERS:

We would have to say that we owned

11

these artifacts pursuant to contracts that have already been

12

fully executed and that are otherwise valid on the face, and

13

under which possession is already --

14

QUESTION:

And supposing in reply to that pleading

15

there had been some response filed that had showed that

16

there had been res judicata on the issue and you had no

17

valid claim of ownership, could you then still have asserted

18

the Eleventh Amendment?

19

MRS. SMATHERS:

20

QUESTION:

21

We believe that we could.

Without any basis for really supporting

the ownership claim.

22

MRS. SMATHERS:

23

QUESTION:

That's right.

Why couldn't you assert the Eleventh

24

Amendment defense just to a possessory action, a possessory

25

action against the state to make the state turn over

We could do that,

if the state was

you have to claim is possession,

However, we did

We claimed both.

the state was in possession of the property.
MRS. SMATHERS:

But the state had

had entered into these contracts on the basis of the

constitutional boundaries as they had existed for 100 years,

and that

The state

17

to go farther and say that it does have a colorable claim to

20

Amendment?

21

MRS. SMATHERS:

MRS. SMATHERS:

After that answer.
Yes, Your Honor, I agree with the

holding in Ex parte Young, but I understand that case to be

20

distinguishable from this one because that case was brought

against an Attorney General who was doing something which

22

was unconstitutional in nature.

suit can be brought against a state official when he is

commiting acts which are unconstitutional in nature, or in

other cases in excess of his statutory authority.

That's not the case here.

Department of State was the party.
QUESTION:

Does the State of Florida differ from

other states that operate only through their officials?
MRS. SMATHERS:

No, Your Honor.

Every state has

6

to operate through its officials, and I think it would be a

7

difference without a difference if we were to say that Ex

8

parte Young could apply in any case where the state was the

9

real party in interest, and yet, obviously the state's

10

11

interest has to be conveyed and carried out by its officials.
I don't think that the Court in Ex parte Young

12

intended to draw that fine a distinction, and certainly in

13

Alabama v. Pugh this Court recognized even where the relief

14

requested could still be achieved by not dismissing the

15

State of Alabama, the Court recognized that it was important

16

enough to dismiss the State of Alabama because of the

17

Eleventh Amendment.

We would also dispute Respondent's representation

if the Eleventh Amendment is to continue to have the
