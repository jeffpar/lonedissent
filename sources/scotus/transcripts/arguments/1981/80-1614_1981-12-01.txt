MR.

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS*
CLAIR:

Mr.

Chief

Justice and may it

10

This case comes before the Court on certiorari to

11 the Ninth Circuit Court of
12 judgment of
13 Court

Appeals and is to review

1 father have died and died before the disclaimers in this
2

case were executed.

However, my client's mother still lives

3 and is the remaining life beneficiary under the testatrix
4 will.

The will, as I may have said, was filed in probate in

5 Massachusetts and was allowed in 1939.

I should note also

6 that at that time the taxpayer was 12 years old.
7

In 1972 at a time in which the taxpayer was 45

8 years old by two separate disclaimers, which are admittedly
9 valid and effective under state law, he disclaimed his
10

entire interest with the contingent remainderman under his

11

grandmother’s will.

12

that he had no interest thereunder after 1972.

13

QUESTION:

And it is agreed, as I understand it,

Mr. St. Clair, it isn’t important at

14

all , but I'm interested.

Why not one?

18

the second one followed a few months later within the same

19

taxable year for the remaining five percent.

20

QUESTION:

The first disclaimer was for 95 percent

Did that indicate a tenacious desire to

21

hold on a little bit or something?

22

MR. ST. CLAIR:

I don't know the answer tc that.

23

All I do know is that within the period of a few months he

24

completely disposed of is interest by disclaimer and that

25

those disclaimers even though partial were valid and

QUESTION

Is the effect of the disclaimer to

23 treat your client as though your client had died before the

MR. ST.

Indeed, indeed.

and I would like to be able to

5 persuade you that the language itself of the regulation
6 makes it quite clear in this context that my client had a

7 right to disclaim without gift tax liability.

First of all --

QUESTION:

Of course, my question would have been

10 isn't the regulation an act of grace to you really?

Not as my brothers are

It's a lodestone around our neck.

As the

Well, you can disclaim it.

You just

21

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Indeed.

When I say we can

22 disclaim without the liability of gift tax.

23

When the will was probated, my client was 12 years

24 old , a fact which incidentally the Ninth Circuit seemed to
25 overlook entirely when they held that the period beyond

21 case before we get to the precise provisions of

the

22 regulation itself which really govern the outcome to discuss
23

very briefly the legal context that was in existence wh en

24

this regulation was promulgated in 1958.

25

At that time it was quite clear that valid and

1 effective disclaimers as a matter of federal common law, if
2 you will, did not affect a gift along the lines that you and
3 I discussed, Hr. Justice Stevens.

The case that decided

4 that is the Brown against Routzahn, and that was an old case
5 in the Sixth Circuit in Ohio, and had been followed, to the
6 extent that these cases had been decided, I think without
7 any exception except one, the Hardenbergh case, again in the
8 Eighth Circuit.
9

In Hardenbergh there was an intestacy, and under

10

the law of the state an intestacy automatically vested title

11

to the bequest in the hands of the beneficiary.

12

nothing you could do about it.

13 law.

There was

It happened as a matter of

Under those circumstances the Eighth Circuit said

14

well, a disclaimer cannot be made under these circumstances

15

because you can't avoid obtaining title to the property; the

16

law gives it to you.

And any disposition of it is subject

17 to tax.

18

That was the status of the law at the time this

19 was promulgated.

The regulation itself by its provisions

20 makes it quite clear that what was intended to be done was
21 to codify this common law as it related to disclaimers
22 insofar as the Internal Revenue Act of

1954 was concerned.

23 And in fact there has been recently released a technical
24 memorandum to that effect making it explicitly clear that
25 that was the intent of the Internal Revenue Service in

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 advising the Treasury of the recommendation for the adoption
2 of this regulation
3

1211-1(c).

The common law also, without exception, treated

4 the beainning of the period beyond which a disclaimer could
5 not be effected as being the point where the contingent
6 remainderman in this case first obtained ownership of the
7 property

,

that is, once it became vested fully it became

8 then his property, and

the time under state law within which

9 it could thereafter be disclaimed began to run.
10

And that wwhole body of law, we submit, was

11 embodied in thi s att
12 exc eption; and that
13 the regulation int en

20 con test that at all.

24

Now, with that understanding of what the context

25 of the law was, I wo
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 language itself of the regulation in an effort to
2 demonstrate

to you that it, in effect, in express terms

3 provides that the time beyond which my client

could not

4 effectively disclaim his interest without incurring a
5 federal gift tax liability commences upon the date when he,
6 if he ever does,

obtains the full quality and quantity of

7 vested ownership in the property; that is, if he survives
8 the life tenant.

9

The full text is set forth in the petition for

10 certiorari in the appendix at page 30, and I will make only
11 brief references to the precise language, if I may.
The critical point reads as follows:

12

"A refusal

13 to accept ownership does not constitute the making of a gift
14 if the refusal is made within a reasonable time after
15 knowledge of the existence of the transfer."
Now the question is well, what is the transfer

16
17 that
18 two
19 just

initiates this time period?

Well, there are in fact

transfers referred to in the regulation.

The first is,

briefly above that, is a transfer or rather a refusal

20 to accept ownership of property transferred from a
21 decedent.

So that in one aspect the transfer has to be the

22 transfer of the property from the decedent without any

23 retained interest or without any rights of revocation or the
24 like; and that is accomplished in this case.
25

The second reference is further down, and there it

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 says
2

"If a person fails to refuse to accept a transfer to

him," -- note "transfer to him" -- "of ownership of a

3 decedent ’s property within a reasonable time after learning
4 of the existence of the transfer, he will be presumed to
5

have accepted the property."

6
7

Now we know that the transfer must be first from
the settlor and also must be to the person who is

8 disclaiming.
9

That second step has not yet happened and had

not yet happened in 1972, because at that time he had only a

10 contingent interest dependent upon his ability
11

his mother.
QUESTION*

12
13

to survive

Doesn’t that depend on whether the word

"property" refers to the contingent interest or to the

14 assets that are transferred?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

15

Well, it says "ownership of

16 decedent’s property."

Now, at one time this regulation in Its early

17

18 drafting

had the word, instead of "transfer," it had "the

19

existence of the interest," and "the interest" was changed

20

to the word

21

of making it clear that no period of time starts running

22

under this regulation until the contingent remainderman has

23

received ownership of the property by a conveyance to him.

24
25

"transfer."

And I suggest for the very purpose

Now, this goes further.

This analysis goes

further than the Eighth Circuit analysis in Keinath.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 decided it would be that way.
The Government further contends well, this is

2

3 simply an assignment of this contingent remainder.
4 course, it isn't an assignment.

Well, of

If it were an assignment,

5 the taxpayer could direct persons to whomever he determines
6 should have this contingent interest.
7

QUESTION:

You mean it couldn't be an assignment

8 unless you had an identifable assignee.
ME. ST. CLAIR:

9

Yes.

It could be one of the

10 persons who would otherwise get it, or it could be somebody
11 else.

But even more importantly, there is another section

12 of the regulations, 2511-1(h)(6), which deals with
13 assignments of such interests.

And as the court in Keinath

14 pointed out,

if 2511-1(c) covers assignments, then (h)(6) is

15 superfluous.

Of course, these things must be read together

16 in

17

pari materia and so forth.
As I was saying, the Keinath court went a little

18 different route.

Happily, they came out the same place.

19 They said look, we can't find any specific reference in this
20 regulation as to when this time period starts.
21 long it runs, but we don't know when it starts.

We know how
And since

22 the regulation doesn't tell us anything about it -- and we
23 disagree on that point, as you know -- we will look to state
24 law to determine when the time for disclaimers, valid
25 disclaimers starts; and we find, without exception, that it
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 starts when the interest becomes fully vested in the
2 beneficiary.
3

The facts with respect to that finding are even

4 more so true today.

More than I think 35 states have

5 addressed the issue of the commencement of a period for a
6 valid exercise of the right to disclaim under state law, and
7 they all say when the contingent remainderman becomes fully

8 vested.

Not only that, but the various uniform laws of

9 disclaimer and uniform probate practice laws all make the
10 same provision.
11

QUESTIONi

How long has it been clear that the

12 Commissioner gives this particular construction to his
13 regulation?
14

MR. ST. CLAIR;

Well,

I think that in Keinath that

15 he made that argument in the Tax Court, and Keinath

16 overrruled it.

He again repeated the argument in the Tax

17 Court in this case, and the Ninth Circuit sustained it.

Indeed.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Disclaimer cases,

16 don't arise every day in the week.

I have found,

They, however, are

17 becoming, I understand, a little more popular.
18

Now, I have mentioned that in

1976 the Congress

19 addressed this question, and the Congress in the Tax Reform
20 Act of 1976 made expressly the provisions that my brothers
21 argue for are contained in this regulation, namely that any
22disclaimer must be made within -- they didn't say a
23 reasonable time; they said nine months.

And that's the only

That is, in 1933 my client

1 would have had nine months within which to exercise -- to
2 disclaim this gift if it were not for the fact that he was
312 years old.
The 1976 Act says as a second alternative if,

4
5

however, the holder of the interest is a minor, then we will

6 wait until nine months beyond the time he becomes 21, but he
7

must do it then.

And that's just what the Government is now

8 arguing is the meaning of the 1958 regulation.
9

The critical point is, though, that the 1976 Act

10 expressly made it prospective in application only to
11

interest created after 1976.

12

House reports make it clear that the Congress now, not the

13

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, but that the Congress

14

intended the prior law to govern all transactions regarding

15

interest created prior to that time.

2 change the Keinath law.

And that is set forth in our briefs

3 in the committee report itself.

So there could be no

4 question but this was not an accident on the part of
5 Congress.

This was a deliberate act to change what it

Do you think it ' s got mo re authority

1

NR. ST. CLAIR:

Indeed.

First of all, it is

2 legislation; it is not a regulation by any means.

It is a

3 recognition by Congress that the law should be changed to
4 accomplish what my brothers say has always been the law.
5 Those two thoughts cannot be accommodated.

And this is not

6 just in the legislative history. Nr. Justice White.
7 have not made it clear to you.

I may

It's in the legislation

8 itself.
9

QUESTION:

I understand.

I understand that.

But

10 it certainly -11

MR. ST. CLAIR;

There would be no point in making

12 it effective only -13

QUESTION:

It certainly has happened an awful lot

14 around where Congress passes a statute that confirms an
15 agency's view of the law although is quite contentious; and
16

we still have to decide what the old law meant, and it can

17 end up and mean exactly what the Congress thought it meant.
18

NR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, I'm only arguing that the

19 Congress thought differently and provided legislation that
20 con tradicts, in effect, the position now being taken by my
21 brother, because my brother's interpretation would abrogate
22the prospective only portion of the legislation.
23

QUESTION:

Well, except you can explain the

24 prospective application of the statute just by the fact they
25 wanted the nine months rule to be prospective.

Wouldn't

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that be a sufficient explanation?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

2

Well, no.

They said it's not only

3 nine months, but it starts when the original gift is made cr
4 when the individual becomes of age;

so they deal with the

5 duration and with the commencement of the time.

They deal

6 with the whole package.

7

QUESTION;

But they also use the word "transfer"

8 to refer to the creation of the interest.

They talk about

9 transfer creating an interest, and your argument is
10 "transfer" refers to the transfer of assets rather than

11 creation of a contingent remainderman.
MR. ST. CLAIR;

12

When I talk about transfer I'm

13 talking about as it is used in the regulation.
14

QUESTION;

15

MR. ST. CLAIR:

16

itself.

Right.
By the terms of the regulation

"Transfer" as an English word could mean a lot of

17 things, including a transfer of an interest.
16
19

20

QUESTION;

But in the statute the word "transfer"

quite clearly would refer to the -MR. ST. CLAIR;

The original transfer and any

21 interest thereafter in the property.

It is a wide-ranging

22 provision designed to do, as a corrective measure, what the

23 Commission now argues was always the situation anyway.

At least you have Judge Harris below

25 agreeing with you, don't you?

3

QUESTION:

Of course. Judge Harris comes out of

4 the Eight Circuit, too.
5

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, you would know, sir, more

6 about the Eighth Circuit perhaps than I would, except that I
7 think, frankly, the Eight Circuit rationale, although it is
8 not perhaps as precise our analysis of the regulation, is
9 certainly a supportable one.

The case is far better

10 reasoned, with all due respect, than the Ninth Circuit
11 decision.

The Ninth Circuit decision was simply a denial cf

12 the validity of the Eighth Circuit and created this conflict

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SMITH:

5

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
The federal gift tax is imposed upon all gifts,

8

direct and indirect.

9

of the Code.

That is the teaching of Section 2511

A disclaimer of the type involved in this case

10

provides a mechanism for indirect gifts, because property

11

which is directed to a person who doesn't want it, he can

12

disclaim and in the act of disclaiming he causes that

13

property, that interest to be directed to the next party in

14

succession.

15
16
17

QUESTION;

Is this indirect gift to an

identifiable person or to a class?
MR. SMITH;

This is not an indirect gift to an

18

identifiable person, Mr. Chief Justice, but for gift tax

19

purposes that is of no consequence.

20

v. Helvering almost U0 years ago said gifts of future

21

interest are taxable under the Act, and they do not lose

22

this quality merely because of the indefiniteness of the

23

eventual recipient.

24
25

This Court in Robinette

The Petitioner is purported to give the property
to someone whose identity could be later ascertained, and
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this was enough.

That is the purport and operation of the

2 gif t tax.
3

How, there is an exception which takes a

4 disclaimer outside the operation of the gift tax,
5 is the exception,

and that

the grace period, the act of grace, as Mr.

6 Justice Blackmun put it, which is involved in this case.
7

The regulation is Section 1.2511- 1(c), and it

8 provides that a disclaimer can be made free of gift tax if
9 two requirements are fulfilled;

one, it must be valid and

10 effective under state law; and two, it must be made within a
11 reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the
12 transfer.

If those requirements are met, the tax law will

13 consider that the disclaimant never had the property and did
14 not transfer it to the next person or class in line, but
15 that it passed directly from the settlor or the testate or
16 here the testatrix

17

to the next person in line.

QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, do you think that the

18 drafters of the 1958 regulations actually meant to establish
19 a new federal standard of reasonable time beginning the
20 moment the interest was created?

The history seems to

21 indicate that the drafters only meant to codify the
22Brown-Hardenbergh rule which really left it up to state law
23 to determine the federal tax.
24

MR. SMITH;

I don’t think so, Justice O’Connor.

25 think that the Brown-Hardenbergh cases which have been

consequence.

Those cases dealt with the situation

of the disclaimant's capability sr lack of capability under

12 state law.
13 of

And indeed, the regulation uses state law as one

the requirements; that if a disclaimant, at least before

14 the

1981 Act, was incapable of making a disclaimer under

15 state law,
16 and

he wasn't going to come within this exception,

he was going to have made a taxable gift.

2

Mow,

how do these principles apply in this case?

3 'rfe have no quarrel here.

The parties had no quarrel that

4 this was a valid and effective disclaimer under
5 Massachusetts law.

But the parties do quarrel about whether

6 Mr. Jewett made a disclaimer within a reasonable time after
7 knowledge of the existence of the transfer.
8

Here the grandmother, Margaret, died in 1939, but

9 Mr. Jewett, the grandson, did not disclaim until
10 years after the transfer.

Now,

33

that was 24 years after he

11 obtained his majority because Mr.

12

1972,

Jewett was born in 1927.

Now, this might have been valid and effective

13 under state law because the policies of whether a disclaimer

it
14 will be given effect under state law, as Judge Rahm ably
15 pointed

out in the opinion of the Tax Court, have little, if

16 anything,

to do with the policies underlying the gift tax.

17 Under no stretch of the imagination, he concluded

-- and we

18feel the facts fully support his conclusion -- were these
19 disclaimers

made within a reasonable time after knowledge of

20 the existence of the transfer.
21

And indeed, my brother here does not argue, and

22 indeed he really couldn't,

that the 33-year period or the

2324-year period would be a reasonable time, nor does he
24 attempt to justify this inordinate delay on any special fact
25 that knowledge was withheld from him.

30

and in considering the

ME. SMITH*

Exactly.

I mean Congress normally in

2 the estate and gift tax area normally legislates
3 prospectively in order not to disturb, and when it does
4 legislate retroactively, it usually provides for some sort
5 of grace period to allow people to amend their instruments.
6 End here they were simply legislating prospectively.

QUESTION*

7

Is there any legislative history which

8 supports that suggestion as the reason why it was made

10

No, no.

Eut this is a traditional way

11 that Congress acts in the estate and gift tax area.

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, isn't there more — I have

6 to confess it's an awfully close question -- but isn't there
7 more to your opponent's argument, when he points out the
8 words "transfer to him of ownership of a decedent’s property
9 within a reasonable time after learning of the existence of
10 the transfer," and that that language was adopted instead of
11 the language "within a reasonable time after knowledge of
12 the existence of the interest?"

I mean "existence of the

13 interest" would clearly have covered a contingent remainder.

In response I would simply say that

4

Mr. Smith, I mean conceding that a

let me go back with you again

6 to the Brown case because I think it's crucial here.

The 1958 regulation appears to have been adopted

8 for the purpose of
9 and

adopting the Brown-Hardenbergh decisions,

when I asked you about those cases,

10 over them and

Now,

I want to read you some language from the

12 Brown decision which apparently the regulation intended
13 adopt.

to

"The Brown case established that the federal tax on

14 transfers is levied on
15 exercise of

the transfer of property, not on the

a right to renounce testamentary gifts."

New, it seems to me if you look at that language

16

17 and then say that the regulation was adopted to put that
18 into place,

that you come to the conclusion that the tax law

19 applicable to this particular case is as the Petitioner
20 says, even though
21 in

Congress closed the loophole, if you will,

1975.

22

Now, would you comment more specifically on Brown?

23

MR. SMITH;

24 case,

Kell, I don't think that the Brown

really speaks to

Brown was dealing with an estate tax question

under the 1921 Act.

2

QUESTION;

3

NR. SMITH;

Well, it was a testamentary gift -That is true, but it really doesn't

It

7 allow this sort of thing to pass as a marital bequest in
8

that situation where the matter -- where the interest had or

9

had not vested.

10

And I think that the technical memorandum that has

11 been bandied about here and the question of whether the
12 regulation meant to adopt or codify Brown v. Boutzahn and
13Hardenbergh only speaks to the question of the disclaimant ' s
14 capabilty under state law.
15 of the regulation.
16

And that is the first criterion

There's nothing in any of the memoranda

or really -- and I think Petitioner can cite nothing in

17 Brown that has anything to do with timeliness with respect
18to the question that the Court has here.
19

The second requirement in the regulation, that the

20

disclaimer be made within a reasonable time after -- I don't

21 want to paraphrase -- within a reasonable time after
22 knowledge of the existence of the transfer.
23

Here, the transfer the way the gift tax works

24 occurred in

1939

when the grandmother died, and the transfer

25 was made to the testamentary trust.

QUESTION;

1

But the Brown case would say the

2 transfer didn’t occur, and that's the point.
3

MB. SMITH;

The Brown case may have said that, but

4 the Brown case didn't really deal with the question of
5 timeliness.

And I don't think,

Justice O’Connor, that

6 because the regulation talked about a reasonable time within
7 which to make this after -- that yes, it did adopt the
8 capability of state law aspect of Brown, but it went
9 further.

It also went to the question of reasonable time,

10 and

that really goes to the whole essence,

11 the

gift tax is all about.

I think, of what

12 this case from the state law considerations that the Eighth

ME. SMITH:

3

Well, I mean obviously in the absence

of a conflict this is not the kind of case, I think, that

the Solicitor General would seek to ask this Court to

6

exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to review; but now

7

that we do have a conflict, as we pointed out in response to

the Petitioner, we acquiesced in this case because there are

9

some $10 million worth of cases pending.

And despite the

10

fact that there have been two successive statutory actions

11

by Congress in '76 and last summer as well that have issued

12

more precise rules in this area, didn't make us want to

resist what was a clear allegation of a conflict here.

exercised here.

attack.

This is not the kind of case -- this is

The state law that the Keinath court so heavily

relied on deals with entirely different policies, deals with

questions of competing claimants and creditors; and indeed,

with the fact that a Massachusetts court would permit Mr.

But the essence of the gift tax is time.

And I

2 think that what Judge Rahm said, and if I may just read a
3few sentences from page 18 to the appendix to the petition,
4 I think it really summarizes what this case is all about.
5

"The Petitioner possessed for 24 years the

6 effective right to determine who shall ultimately receive
7 the benefits of a 50 percent remainder interest of a trust
8 which in 1972 had a corpus of approximately $8 million.

12 means.

'58 and

In 1972 by the execution of two disclaimers he elected

14 to let the property pass according to the alternative

15 provisions of his grandmother's will to the natural objects
16 of his bounty.

This, we hold, was an exercise of control

17 over the disposition of property subject to the gift tax."

I don’t really think that really one can quarrel

19 with that kind of analysis on the facts in
