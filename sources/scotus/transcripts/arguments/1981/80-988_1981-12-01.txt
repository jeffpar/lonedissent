Mr . Allen, I think you may proceed whenever you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVERETTE G. ALLEN , JR. , ESQ.,

OH

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9the Court, this action arose pursuant to a complaint filed
10 in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that
11 Petitioners, Havens Realty and its employee, Rose Jones,
12 violated the Fair Housinq Act and Section 1982.

As to these

13 Respondents, the complaint vas dismissed on qrounds of lack
14of standing and the statute of limitations.

The Fourth

15 Circuit reversed, and this Court granted certiorari.
16

The complaint here provided the sole facts before

17the Fourth Circuit and provide the sole facts before this
18 Court .

Havens Realty operates two adjacent apartment

19complex•s in llenrico County, Virginia, and is al l eged to
20have engaqed in racial steering at jus t these two apartment
21complexes.

Respondent HOME i s a Richmond-based fair housing

22organization with the avowed purpose of making fair housinq
23in Richmond a reality.

I t s a ctivities include c o unselinq,

24investiqating complaints, and test i ng to ensure compl i ance
25with the fair hou s inq law s .

J
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE•• S.W .. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20024 (202) 554·2345

Its only contact with Petitioner Havens was
2through its employee testers to determine if Havens was
3complying with the fair housing laws.

Its injury is alleged

4 as a frustration to its counseling.

Sr

QUESTION;

Before you get too far along, counsel,

hope at some point that you will discuss the amicus

7representation to the Court that there were certain
8developments after the granting of cert in this case .
9

10

MR. ALLEN;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor .

I will speak to that.

Because that might have something to do

11 with the ultimate disposition.
12

MR. ALLEN:

Yes, sic.

Let me speak to that .

One

13 of the plain tiffs in this case, Paul Allen Coles, was a bona
14fide renter.

He was a party to this complaint .

15complaint withstood the motion to dismiss.

Hi s

He went to

16tcial, and a consent order was en t ered in h is favor, in
17which Havens was found to have been

in racial

18 steering.
19

That consent ord e r, Your Honor, was

to

20Coles and his class, which was a class consisting of all
21 black persons deemed to have been monetarily injured by
22those practices.

I t can in no way, shape, or form affect

23the relief being requested by these Respondents , which is
24damages, other injunctive relief in the form of affirmative
25action, attorneys' fees, wh ich will be substantial.

We submit that under this Court's strin9ent test

2of mootness, this case can ' t be moot .
3

As to the contention that the wri t vas improperly

49ranted, Your Honor, we sub mi t that for the same reasons
Sevidenced in the cert petition, which are thinqs not dealt
6with by this Court before, the tester qua tester issue , the
7dispute -- the conflict between the Fourth Circuit and t he
8Seventh Ci rcuit as to orqanizational standinq, that those
9are questions of importan t

federal and constitutional law

10 that are still in this case and are in no manner affected by
11 t he relief qranted below.

17

18 black wo ma n, and Kent llillis , a white man, are H0!1E
19 employees.

They were not in any way bona fide

20seekers, and their sole reason fo r contactinq Havens was
21 testin9 .

While we are not told precisely where they live,

22the complaint says that they lived some where in the city of
or Henrico County, and that Havens's steerin9 of
24these t wo apartment complexes depri ves them of the benefit
25of interracial associations .

All acts as bet ween Ha vens and

Respondents complain that the district court ' s

4dismissal was precipitous, and that they should ha ve been

They knew the fa c ts

Don't we have to assume that was true?
Yes, Your Honor.

They -- Well, Your

18 Honor, we can assume -- we can assume that Havens steers,
19and we can assume that they have properly alleqed the
20injury, but let me spea k to that particular aspect of the

22count.

2 Your Honor, v e -3

QUESTION:

And don ' t ve have to assume that is

4 true, because ve take the alleQations of the complaint as
5 true?
6

KR. ALLEM:

Your Honor, ve would disa9ree that you

7have to assume any essential element of standinQ.

Re subait

8that there has to be, as required by Article 3, a plausible
9connection between the defendant's acts , bet ween the
10defendant•s acts and the plaintiff's harm.

It is

11 implausible to assume that racial steerinQ directed to two
12apartment coaplexes can affect tvo individuals that live
13 somev here in a metropolitan area of 400,000 people or in
14 fact that they can affect the entire metropolitan area .
15

QUESTION :

Kaybe i t is, but why don't ve have to

16assuae it is true when they alle9e it, and then you prove it
17 isn ' t true?
18

MR.

Your Honor, in Bellwood, essentially

19 the same alleQations that these Respondents made v ere in the
20coaplaint, as noted in the footnotes in Bellwood, the city
21 of Bellwood, in pleadin9 the hara, had said that the actions
22of the defendants affect all the citizens of this
23community .

This Court looked at that complaint and said,

24well, you have alle9ed a harm to one society, and that is
25really not riQht, that is a 9eneralized grievance, and it

1 can't possibly be the defendant •s fault.
2

The vay ve are going to interpret that is, you

3have alleged harm to the residents of a very carefully
4 described 12 by 13 block target area, and for those -- for
5those plaintiffs that live in that target area, ve are qoing
6to assume that you have pled a proper cause -7

It is implausible .

It is

15 imp la usi ble -16

QUESTION:

Well, is there a rule of pleading that

17ve do not take as true implausible allegations?
18

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, I belie ve that the

19lanquaqe of this Court in Warth and in Bellwood, that the
20standard to apply to a complaint is that the plaintiff is to
21 be qiven the benefit o f all mater ial allegations, and the
22complaint is to be construed in his favor.

We think the

UConnelly v. Gibson standard is wrong, and that to allo w that
24standard is for a federal judge to assume that he has qot
25the power to act, and it is not unreasonable, not only not

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1 unreasonable, i t just makes sense to say, if you have qot
2 standinq and you are goinq to invoke the power of the
3 federal fiduciary , plead it.
4

Plead the causal connection .

And it is for that reason that we don't think that

5 this Court has to accept the conclusory allegation of
6pleadin9 that t vo apartment complexes -- ve live in a biq
7metropolitan area .

We have been denied the benefit of

HR. ALLEN ,

21 that the district judge employed the reasoning of TOPIC,

9in the brief that Respondent submitted before the district

We are only suing as persons denied the

I wou ld like to comment on the issue cf HO KE's

In order fo r HOME to sustain

Senable a determina ti on to be made that the three-part test
Sspecified in Warth and Hunt v . Washington Apple Advertising
7Commission has been satisfied.
8

This complaint is completely devoid of any fact

9necessary to even try to make that determination , much less
10 to make it.

Consider only the first part of the test , which

11 is tha t at least one HO l!E member must have standing in his
12own right to maintain this cause of action, wh e r eas the
13 injuries plead , they -- that, that is , denial of the benefit

How can you determine that

What has

The answer is , of course not.

Suppose that black bona fide apartment seeker is

QUESTION;

No, but Mr. Allen , I think the point is

13that if there is a practice of steering, no matter who comes
14 to the real estate aQent ,

that practice would impair HOllE's

15 ability -- they say to someone who comes in to the office,
16well , there is a vacancy over at the Havens Realty office,
17go over there and apply for it .

If the person will not get

18 the a pa rtmen t by doing so, doesn't that impair

s

19ability to refer people to vacant apartments?
20

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, if that were so, that

21 would qive every apartment locater service in Ric hmond a
22cause of action in every case where racial steering or
23violation e ver brought without alleqinq that they were hurt
24 by it .

Would that be so terribl e?

4 will get an honest answer.

KR . ALLEN:

Your Honor, in lookinq at violations

Sin the Fair P.ousinq Act , the usual starting place is what
7was the Congressional intent.

The legislative history is of

8zero help here because i t is obvious that Congress was only
9considering the direct
10 discriminated against .

You can't get any help from the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVERETTE G. ALLEN, JR •, ESQ .,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - CONTINUED

KR . ALLEN :

Thank you.

The Seventh Circuit in Bell vood addressed similar

11 standing questions vith respect to a fair housing
12 organization there knovn as Leadership Council, that made
13p leadings similar to those made here , and concluded that its
14 alleged injury v as just the natural concommitant of and so
15 intert vined v ith its abstract c oncern as to be inseparable
16for Article 3 p ur poses , and ve submit that that rationale is
17 applicable here.
18

Unless the standing requirement is satisfied,

19 simply because Havens is steering, there is no, absolutely
20no facts plead to

a causa l connection betveen that

21 steering and its co unselin g service .

Admittedly, as Mr .

22Justice Stevens pointed out, there is a conclusory
23allegation that they v ere harmed.

There are no facts plead

24 that any HO KE client was ever sent to this apartment

If this had been a summary

6judg•ent, vo uldn't you be in a •uch stronger position v here
7there had been discovery and so forth, than rather just to
8go off on the pleadings without any affida vits or discovery?
9

MR . ALLEN;

No, Kr . Justice Rehnquist, because I

10 don't believe the concept of noticed pleading ou9ht to be
11 appl icable to standing .

Standing is a jurisdictional

12matter, and in order to invoke the power of the federal
13 court, there ouQht to be facts that distinctively and
14affirmatively sho w that the federal court has aot po wer, and
15I don ' t

think that the idea of noticed pleading, vh ere the

16plaintiff is just supposed to put the defendant generally on
17notice of vh at the claim is about, ought to be the same
18 standard wh en you are talking about standing.

Well, there are individuals involved

20 here, aren • t there?

KR. ALLEN :

Yes, there are, Your Honor.
Would you say that jurisdiction of the

10

QUESTION:

It is raised nov .

HR . ALLEN :

11 to the testers .

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Let me t urn

The Fourth Circuit found standing for the

12testers on tvo grounds, first, as surrogates raising the
13rights of third parties, and secondly as individuals denied
14 the benefit of interracial associations.

We submit that the

15Fourth Circuit reliance on Pierson and Evers is wrong, that
16 the emphasis is misplaced.

The plaintiffs in those cases

17had standing because they had injuries, not because they
18 v ere tested, and the testing motive is absolut ely irrelevant
19 for standing purposes .
20

The Fourth Circuit's decision granted standing as

21 a tester qua tester without regard to any alleaation of
22injury , its reasoning being the broad public policy of the
23Fair Housing Act .

That flies in the face of Article 3 , and

24 cannot be sustained.
25

Nov, before this Court, Respondents have abandoned

4 l!r . Justice White has said, her 8011(d) claim.

Still, the

5 Fourth Circuit's opinion vith respect to tester qua tester
6 standing is still there and has to be corrected
7

QUESTION•

What if Conoress had funded a series of

6 state and local aoencies to do testing, and rather expressly
9 provided that those testers vere to be able to brin9 an
10 action under the section that you assail here?

Would you

15 that agency to -- and I think this is perhaps the vay to
16ansver it -- to enforce the same rights that private
17 individuals could enforce -- for example, Secti on 813, I
18 believe, gives the Attorney General certain right s vi th
19 respect to practices and patterns, et cetera .

ORAL ARGUKEMT OF VANESSA RUIZ , ESQ.,

ON BEHALF P F THE RESPONDENTS
MS. BUIZ:

Kr. Chief Justice, and may it please

4 the Court , this case presents the issue vhether a local fair
Shousin9 9roup and t vo individuals, one black and one vhite,
6 vho have en9a9ed in testing of the defendant's housing
1

practices have standing under the Fair Housing Act to obtain

6relief from the defendant ' s racially discriminatory housing
9practices vhen the local fair housing organization and the
10individuals both reside in the community that they claim has
11 been affected by these racially discriminatory housing
12practices, and have been the recipients of racially biased
13housin9 information from this defendant.
14

QUESTION:

Ks. Ruiz, could I ask you about your

15 def ini ti on of the wor d "community"?

Would you think

16community as you have just used it could be extended to mean
17

the whole northeast corridor of the Oni ted States, from

18 Boston to Richmond?
19

KS. RUIZ:

Ho, sir .

I don't think that a person

20vho lives in Boston could claim that his community, his day
21 to day life, his day to day activities, are affected in the
22vay that ve claim that they have been affected in this case
23by the activities, let's say, of a realtor in •ew York .
24 I would not extend it that far, and this case does not
25extend that far .

This case only deals with the Pic hmond

No,

1 area .
2

The case is before this Court in a somewhat

3 unusual posture , and it presents a narrower issue.

The case

4 is here on review from a grant of a motion to dismiss for
51ack of standinq .

Therefore, the complaint must be presumed

6true and construed in favor of the plaintiffs.
7complaint was filed on January 19th, '79.
6 the plaintiffs were out of court .

The

By February 16th,

They appealed to the

9 Fourth Circuit, which held in their favor.

The defendants

10then petitioned this Court for review.
11

Rhile this v hole appeals process vas takinq place,

12ho vever, the co mpanion case of Paul Coles, a black man
13 denied housinq by Havens, continued on to discovery and for
14 trial on the merits.

After presentation of the evidence to

15 the District Cour t, the jud9e found , and I quote from the
16findings of fact, that "Havens Realty established a policy
17of discrimination against black people in the rental of its
18 apartments, and that this was a conscious and deliberate
19 policy on the part of Havens Rea lty . "
20

Because of the procedural pos ture of this case

21 before this Court , review of the qrant of the aotion to
22dismiss and the finding that the defendant has violated the
23Fair Housing Act in Section 1982 , we believe that this case
24 presents only th e issue of whe ther these plaintiffs ,
25Responde nt s before the Court here today, should bP allowed

go

back to the District Court, pick up where they left

2 off, and continue to prove their case, that they are
3 entitled to relief from these defendants.
4

QUEST ION:

!s. Ruiz, isn't there a provision in

5the federal rules that upon the filing of a motion to
6dismiss, you can ask that ruling on it be deferred pending
7taking of depositions or affidavits?
6

!S. RUIZ:

Indeed, sir, we requested that.

9requested that the District Court on a motion for
10 reconsideration that the -- that any decision on the motion
11 to dismiss be deferred until the taking of an already
12 scheduled deposition.

In fact, we also noted the fact that

13this Court was considering and would shortly be deciding the
14 Bellwood case, which would probably be instructive to the
15 District Court.
16

That motion was

QUESTION :

that request was denied .

What do you have to say about the

17 suggestion that this might be an appropriate case for
18exercising discretion to dismiss as improvidently granted
19 because of the intervening events, that is, the consent
20 dee ree?
21

MS . RUIZ:

Well, we think that the consent decree

22does not render the case moot, so that the court has po wer,
23has jurisdiction to hear the case if it so wi s h es .

The

24court might decide, however, that it does not wish to hear
25this case at this time because precisely of the procedural

12 Act, the broad remedial purposes of the Fair Housin9 Act,

14 of the Fair Rousing Act for s t rong private enforcement of

18the Act is to be as broad as permissible under Article 3,
19re quire that these plaintiffs be 9ranted sta nding to proceed
20 wi th their action .
21

QUESTION :

Ms. Ruiz , do you concede that Willis

22lacked standing?
23

MS. RUIZ :

No.

Justice O'Connor, we believe that

24 Mr. Willis has standing based on his claim that as a
of the community affected by the racial steering

79
Al.DEASON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRCllNIA AVE.. S.W .. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20024 (202) 554·2345

1 practices, he has been affected and injured by these
2 practices.
3 v here

Because of the particular facts in this case,
Willis was not qiven misinformation, racially

4 biased misinformation by Havens, we believe that he would
5 not have a claim under Section 804(d), but he would have
6standing as a resident of the community affected by these
7 practices.

8

Ms . Coleman, however, was given such

9misinformation, and the statute makes i t unlawful to
10misrepresent on the basis of race to any person, and that
11 would include Ms . Coleman .
12

QUESTION:

Would her claim be time barred, however?

13

MS. RUIZ:

Her claim?

No, we don't believe i t

14vould be time barred, because the violation which has been
15alleged here and which in fact was found by the district
16judge, is the policy, on an ongoing and continuing basis, a
17policy of discrimination, a policy of racial steering .

Nov,

18 that policy extended back for a period of time, during the
19time when Ms. Coleman contacted Havens up to the limitations
20period, the 180-day period, which was Mr . Cole's incident,
21 and indeed, continued past that, to 1978 through 1980, as we
22have been able to see now, pursuant to the claims filed
23under the consent order vas the claimants came forward and
24were granted relief by the court pursuant to the
25magistrate's recommendation that they had been discriminated

QUESTION :

Could someone, do you think , come

3 for v ard no w and say that they were a victim of a steering
4 practice in 1969 because it v as a continuing violation and
5 Havens had al v ays steered, even after the 1968 Act made it
6 unla wful?

8 unla v ful.

RUIZ:

In 1969 ,

the action vould have been

The claim , if they could prove that their claim

9 vas based on the same policy and practice, and I think that

10 that would be a difficult claim to 111ake, but assu111ing that
11 they could , I think their claim should be -- should be heard
12 by the court.

In a situation such as that, of course, the

13court has certain kinds of discretionary and prudential
14 authority, where it vould be unfair to the defendant to
15 exclude certain claims, but that aqain is not this case.
16

In this case, we are talking about incidents that

17occurred not a number of years back but a mere two, three
18months before the Coles incident .
19

OUESTIOHl

The reason I ask the question is, you

20 have used in your argument the term " c ontinuing violation",

22as these, and both of vhich are somevhat amorphous, I

13

I would like to address the argument by opposing

That is his claim .

14 counsel that testers do not have standing qua testers .

In

15 fact, we do not make that argument, and we do not posit that
16that the standing of Willis and Cole•an is based on their
17status as testers .

What we say is that the fact that they

18engaged in testing does not undermine their standing, given
19the fact they have a good claim on their own.
20

This Court's prior decisions concerning standing

21have addressed usually two factors.

One, whether the case

22is justiciable, and two, whether there is adverseness
23bet wee n the parties.

In this case, th• fact that the Fair

24Housin g Act has provided a broad remedy for any pe rson is a
25clear indicator that the case ind e ed i s justiciabl e .

Is there injury in

QUESTION ;

If the statute had provided any person

9seeking a place of residence in 9ood faith, and then vent on

In fact, the

It does not require i t as

So the only require111ent is that there be an injury

15in fact to th ese plaintiffs that is fairly traceable, that
16is plausibly connected .

QUESTION:

!lay I ask one other question?

Does

18 that injury have to occur within 180 days of the filina of
19 the complaint?

Supposing the vhite tester moved to Boston

Would he still have

!I S. RUIZ •

No, sir.

What the statute says is that

9the housinq practice must have occurred within the 180 days .

QUESTION :

So you vould say if he moved to Bos ton

12from the same practice that continued into the 180-day
13 period , he could still sue?

Well, of course you can ' t go back

OUESTION :

It is very fresh .

23

MS. RUIZ :

Well , if ve have tape recordings, and

24 there is absolutely no question that the plaintiff can come
25for v ard and prove his claim, if there is no unfairness to

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W ., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 5$4•2345

1 this defendant because it is one and the same practice, and
2 there has been a policy, I vould say yes, he can bring his
3 claim.

It is not this case , but I vould say that there is

4 no logical inconsistency vi th saying that claimant could
5 brin9 the clai11 .
8

QUESTION :

Ms . Ruiz , the Solicitor General takes

7the position that the continuing violation theory does not
8apply to a party vho merely asserts a right to receive
9correct information, instead of the neighborhood resident
10 theory .

I/hat is your comment about the Solicitor General 's

11 position?
12

RUIZ;

Wel l, I think that v hen ve

talk about a

13 continuing violation, ve are focusing not on the plaintiff
14and the right asserte1 , but on the violation and the conduct
15of the defendant, and if the receipt of misinformation has
16been pursuant to an on9oinq, continuing practice that
17violate the Act, ve contend that even the person who brings
18an action under 80U{d) for receipt of misinformation is
19 entitled to have that claim survive on a subsequent incident
20vhich is within the 180-day limitations period, because it
21 is part of one same continuing practice .

It is the

22defendant's conduct that we look to then, not the nature of
23 the claim .
24

This case , as far as th e injury claimed, as far as

25the pleadings filed, is really no different from the cases

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVERETTE G. ALLEN, JR . , ESQ . ,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

10

KB. ALLEN:

11

To start vith counsel's last point, it vas that

Yes, Your Honor .

12 this case is like Trafficante and Bellwood, and I ha ve to
13 say that I

think that's absurd .

Traffica nte allowed persons

14 injured by discrimination aqainst others to assert the
15riqhts, and v e vere talkin 9 about an apartment complex,
16 where the act of discrimination, the racial aanipulation was
17 at

th at apartment complex .

Bell wood chanqed it a bit,

18 because in Bell wood you had a villaqe of 20,000 people , and
19you had a fairly sizeable area v ithin that villaQP of 12 to
20 13 bloc ks, and not11ithstandin9 that, the Court had some
21 difficulty and in fact refrained fro• allovin9 standin9 for
22 t vo plaintiffs that lived outside of that tarqet area .
23

Nov vhat ve have done is, ve have contracted the

24tar9et area dovn to two apartments, and we have expanded the
25 size of the area that the people can live in to a whole

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
•OO l/lRGINIA AVE., S.W, WASHINGTON, O.C. 2002• C202) 55'•23•5

1 •etroi:olitan area.

This is a quantu111 leap fro• Bellwood .

2 And if i t goes that far , where does it stop next?
3

In reading the Bellwood oral arguments, one

4 question from the bench was, where does this end?

And if we

Slived in northern Illinois , and we don't like what is goinq
6on in Bell wood, can we co•i:lain about it?
7 was , oh , no .

Oh , no .

And the ans wer

We are goino to be reasonable about

6 this , and we are only going to deal vith an area that is
9 affected .
10

Another question asked from the bench in Bell wood

11 is, ho w •any pri vate attorner generals are we talking
12about?

Well, in Richmond ,

Virginia, if this co•plaint is

13 upheld , you are talking about 1100,000.

There is no question

14 about that .
15

The question wa s rai s ed, vell, should we dismiss

16 the writ as improvidently granted and opposing counsel says,
17well, we just vant to

go

back and amend .

It has been

18 admitted that the Fourth Circuit' s decision in tester qua
19tester is wrong .

That needs to be changed .

That can 't be

20left standing by dismissing the writ as improvidently
21 granted .
22

The representational standing .

The facts are not

that case to support representational standino, and no
24 one can say that they are.
25

Thirdly, this decision by the Fourth Circuit is

II 0

Mr . Justice Rehnquist raised , well, you know, why

4 didn • t you 111ove to -- why didn • t you move to be given the
5 rio ht to furni s h informa tion later?

Th e point wa s , "r·

6 Jus tice Rehnquist, they had this opportunity .

When the

7defendant moved to dismiss this case , they had an
8opportunity then to supply wha teve r facts they wanted to
9 supply .

They have had no difficulty sup plying t he m in this

10 brief before this Court for the first time .
11

The iaportant thing to note h ere is that thes e

12 Respondents wan t ed to stand on this compl a int .

They wanted

13 this District Court to accept the broad allegations in this
14 complaint and that is why they plead it .

That is why they

15 had final judgaent entered under Rule 54, and that is why

18 they have appealed.
17

This isn't a matter of inadvertently doing

18 any thing wr onq .

This wa s a delibe rate effort to have these

19broad alleoations accepted by the Dis t rict Court .

QUESTIO N;

23

OUESTION i

Yes, sir .
If we found that Coleman had standing,

24 would we need to reach the standing of anybody else?

25

MR.

1 Coleman's claim under Section 804(d) is , as Justice O'Connor
2pointed out, absolutely barred by the statute of

That receipt of false information is a claim

And I don't see hov the statute

Scan be interpreted any other var than that she has Qot 180
6days from the day she Qets that vron9 inforaation to brin9
