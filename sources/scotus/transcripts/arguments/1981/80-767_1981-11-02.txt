ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10 the Court, the Appellee in this case is a member of the old
11 order Amish religious sect who employed other members of
12 that sect on his farm and in his carpentry shop during the
13 taxable years involved, 1970 through 1977.

He did not

14 withhold social security taxes from their wages or pay the
15 employer’s share of those taxes, and after an Internal
16 Revenue Service assessment in 1978, he paid the taxes for
17 one quarter of one year for an employee, and brought this
18 suit for a refund, claiming that the tax as applied violated
19 the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.
20

The basis for this claim is the belief of the old

21 Amish sect to which he adhered that the members are to care
22 for their aged, their sick, and their unemployed, and do not
23 need any form of social welfare benefits from outside their
24 religious community, and that it is a sin either to accept
25 social security benefits or to pay the social security taxes.

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The District Court upheld his claim that the tax

2 was unconstitutional as applied, and the United States
3 appealed to this Court.
4

QUESTION:

At the time he made the first quarterly

5 payment, Mr. Wallace, what were his alternatives?

Was he

6 subject to a likely seizure or levying on his property?
7

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the ordinary enforcement

8 procedures to collect the taxes would be utilized, Mr. Chief
9 Justice, but of course this case has been litigated, and
10 none of those procedures have been put into effect.

The

11 case was tried on a stipulation, and counsel have agreed
12 that the amount of taxes owing will be agreed upon should
13 the United States prevail in this case.
14

QUESTION:

Well, but his act at that time in

15 paying presumably did not compromise his religious beliefs
16 because he had no choice, no real choice.

If he wanted to

17 continue his business, he had to yield to the government’s
18 demand.
19

MR. WALLACE:

20 payment.

I can't really speak for whether that offended his

21 religious beliefs.

He at least was willing to make the

He made it under a claim of right to a

22 refund, and perhaps that reconciled it with his belief.
23

QUESTION:

He is still claiming here today —

24

MR. WALLACE:

He is still claiming the right to a

25 refund.

1

QUESTION*

Mr. Wallace, in the face of that

2 finding cf the District Court that it was a sin not only to
3 accept but also a sin to pay these taxes, can the Court go
4 behind that?
5

MR. WALLACE*

6

QUESTION*

Well, I don’t —

I mean, do we have to decide this case

7 by accepting —
8

MR. WALLACE*

We are not asking —

9

QUESTION*

by accepting that holding,

—

that it

10 is a sin to pay as well as —
11

MR. WALLACE*

We accept that holding, that that is

12 his religious belief, and —
13

QUESTION*

But you rely on the balancing aspect.

14

MR. WALLACE*

15

QUESTION s

16

MR. WALLACE*

We do, Mr. Chief Justice.

But I gather that —
We do ask the Court to look behind

17 that religious view.
18

QUESTION*

Does that imply then that you don’t

19 question that to pay would seriously infringe upon his free
20 exercise rights?
21

MR. WALLACE*

We don't agree with quite that

22 formulation, Justice Brennan.

We don't question that he in

23 good faith and with sincerity believes that it would be a
24 sin to pay the tax, and he is making —
25

QUESTION*

But nevertheless, nevertheless, to the

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 extent that infringes upon free exercise rights, I gather
2 the government’s position is that the governmental interest,
3 what, overrides?

Is that it?

4

MR. WALLACE:

5

QUESTION:

That is our position.

It has to give way to the governmental

6 interest?
7

MR. WALLACE:

That this is not in the

8 circumstances of a generally applicable tax protected by the
9 free exercise clause.
10

QUESTION:

What I am trying to get at is —

11

MR. WALLACE:

They are — to pay a tax assessed on

12 all persons —
13

QUESTION:

What I am trying to get at —

14

MR. WALLACE:

15

QUESTION:

— for an economic activity.

Mr. Wallace, wait, will you?

Are you

16 suggesting, then, that this is a strict scrutiny kind of
17 analysis, and that the government interest under strict
18 scrutiny prevails over the free exercise right?
19

MR. WALLACE:

20 of that kind.

We haven’t really suggested a test

The Court has spoken in terras of a balancing

21 test in the pertinent cases, looking toward the interest
22 claimed under the free exercise clause and the governmental
23 interest.
24

I don't know that it is —
QUESTION:

Well, what is the test by which we

25 determine that the free exercise right must give way to the

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 governmental interest?
2

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I am not sure that I can

3 formulate it in an abstract way other than to use what the
4 Court has used, that you examine the claim that is made
5 under the free exercise clause, and the nature of the
6 government's interest, and make a determination.

This claim

7 is quite different from many others that have been before
8 the Court, and we have tried to describe some of those
«

9 differences in our brief.
10

I don’t really think that the case can be answered

11 with an abstract standard.
12

QUESTION:

Congress attempted to provide some

13 relief for these people, did it not?
14

MR. WALLACE:

It did provide an exemption from the

15 self-employment tax, which we have referred to in our brief,
16 but it was very careful in providing that exemption to limit
17 it only to the self-employment tax, and the committee report
18 specifies that the committee did not want to go beyond that
19 and compromise the principle that social security
20 contributions are not to be a voluntary matter beyond that
21 narrow area.
22

QUESTION:

On the constitutional point, though, if

23 he believes it is a sin for him to pay himself, apparently
24 he also believes that it is a sin for him to pay for workers
25 who are now working on his farm.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MB. WALLACE;

Well, the claim does embrace the

2 employees’ share of the tax as well as the employer's share.
3 Under the social security laws, both the employer and the
4 employee are responsible for part of the tax, although as it
5 happens in this case, since he did not withhold anything
6 from the wages of the employees, he himself was responsible
7 for the entire tax.
8

QUESTIONi

Mr. Wallace —

9

HR. WALLACE;

He has to paywhether

hewithholds

10 or not.
11

QUESTION;

Do you think the exemption with respect

12 to self-employed Amish runs afoul of the establishment
13 clause?
14

HR. WALLACE;

15

QUESTION;

16

HR. WALLACE;

We do not think so, Hr. Justice.

Why?
Although there

isadmittedly

some

17 tension with it, but we think it is a permissible
18 accommodation of values, of religious values that the
19 government can make under a number of this Court's cases
20 that do permit some area of legislative discretion in
21 accommodating religious beliefs with the general
22 requirements of the law, and indeed, we think that the
23 exemption could be extended to the employment taxes if
24 Congress saw fit to do so.
25

QUESTION;

But at present, does it work this way,

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that the exemption applies to an individual, but if he
2 engaged or employed — how many people before the exemption
3 would not be applicable?
4

HE. WALLACE;

It is not applicable to the

5 employment relationship at all.
6

QUESTIONi

So if he had a single employee, the

7 exemption would not be applicable?
8

MR. WALLACE;

9

QUESTION;

10

To the employment relationship.

Yes.

HR. WALLACE;

It is still applicable to his own

11 self-employment.
12

QUESTION;

Of course.

13

MR. WALLACE;

*

Even though it is not applicable to

14 the wages that he pays to his employee.
15

QUESTION;

Hr. Wallace,perhaps

16 it, but if so, I have missed it.

youhave stated

What is the situation as

17 to the employees here?

Are they also old order Amish?

18

The stipulation so states, although

MR. WALLACE;

19 it doesn't say how many there are.

The record just doesn't

20 show that.
21

QUESTION;

Would the case

bedifferentif they

22 were not?
23

MR. WALLACE;

I think there would be less basis

24 for the claim that there was a right to exclude them under
25 the free exercise clause from social security coverage.

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Yes, Mr. Justice
2

QUESTION!

Is it not true that some of the old

3 order Amish have left the faith?
4

MR. WALLACE;

5

QUESTION*

6

MR. WALLACE*

So far as I am aware

The record doesn't show this?
The record does not show this.

The

7 committee report which Congress issued and that it enacted
3 the exemption for self-employment in 1965 did emphasize that
9 the proposed exemption in their belief must be on the basis
10 of individual choice to exclude all members of a religious
11 group from social security coverage would not take account
12 of the variances in individual beliefs within any religious
13 groups, and would deny social security protection to those
14 individuals who want it.
15

Among the old older Amish, for example, there have

16 been some indications of a change in attitude towards social
17 security, particularly among the younger people.

Some

18 members of the old order Amish who have become eligible for
19 social security benefits have claimed the benefits.
20

QUESTION*

Is this Report Number 213?

21

MR. WALLACE*

That is Number 213.

However,

22 nothing in the record of this case indicates anything of
23 this kind.
24

QUESTION*

Even though you may not have made it as

25 sharply as I am about to state it, I took the sum and

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 substance of your position in the brief to be that the
2 government of the United States can't run a nationwide
3 program like tax collection or social security and one like
4 this if there are these ad hoc exceptions, except as
5 Congress explicitly makes them.

Is that pretty close to

6 your position?
7

MR. WALLACE*

8

QUESTION*

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, then, how do you distinguish

9 Sherbert against Verner, or the Thomas case of last year?
10

MR. WALLACE*

Well, we discuss those cases in our

11 brief.
12

QUESTION;

I realize you do.

13

MR. WALLACE;

They involved much more serious

14 problems for the claimant of the free exercise right,
15 choosing between, in the Sherbert case, observance of one's
16 Sabbath or one’s economic livelihood, and in the Thomas case
17 something very comparable, because of the loss of employment
18 that was involved there, in order not to perform something
19 that one believed could not be performed.
20

Here, the Amish, who do not want to be within the

21 social security program, of course, do not have to accept
22 benefits, and there is no indication that they believe that
23 the furnishing of benefits to others in the national
24 community who are covered by the program is in any way in
25 conflict with their beliefs.

Their claim really is that

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 there is, as they see it, an implication in their paying the
2 tax that somehow they will become eligible for the benefits,
3 and that indicates the sin of not planning to take care of
4 their own community.
5

But that is, with all respect to their belief, a

6 construction that they choose to put on the payment.

So far

7 as Congress is concerned, this is just a generally
3 applicable tax on a commercial relationship, and the
9 employment relationship for engaging in commercial activity.
10

QUESTION*

Well, couldn't you say the same thing

11 about Thomas last year?
12

NR. WALLACE*

Well, in the Thomas case, he was

13 performing work that was contrary to his religious belief,
14 and by denying him unemployment compensation rights for
15 giving up the job for that reason, there would be economic
16 pressure on him to engage in work that is contrary to his
17 religion.
18

I realize —
QUESTION*

I take it, Mr. Wallace, you suggest

19 here that they can pay the taxes* that doesn’t stop them
20 from continuing to support their own people.
21

ME. WALLACE*

22

QUESTION*

v

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

Which is the distinction from Sherbert

23 and Thomas that you make.
24

MR. WALLACE*

It is the essence of the distinction

25 that we make.

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTIONS

They don't lose what Thomas and Verner,

2 or Sherbert, or whoever it was, would have lost.
3

MR. WALLACES

4

QUESTIONS

Yes.

But that suggests that in the scale of

5 values the economic one is the top one rather than the
6 religious belief of the particular claimant.
7

MB. WALLACES

Well, all religious beliefs as

8 beliefs stand on the same footing under the Constitution.
«

A

•

9 religious group might believe that it is a sin to pay any
10 tax to secular authority, and that as a belief would stand
11 on the same footing as the interpretation of social security
12 tax payments that this group chooses to put on those
13 payments, but that doesn't mean that there is a
14 constitutional right to act on those beliefs and to refuse
15 to pay the taxes that are levied on non-religious grounds
16 generally in the community on the basis of commercial
17 activities.
18

QUESTION*

Mr. Wallace, may I ask, is there

19 anything in this record that suggests that the Amish would
20 stop supporting their own people if they lost this case?
21

MR. WALLACES

22

QUESTIONS

23

MR. WALLACE;

24

QUESTIONS

Not at all.

Not at all, Your Honor.

Nothing in the stipulation or otherwise?
Not at all, and —

Is there anything to prevent them from

25 having all of the social security or the other payments of

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this kind come back to a fund, the same kind of a fund that
2 the Amish use to take care of their needy, in other words,
3 so that it wouldn’t come back to assist any individual
4 except through the group operation?
5

MR. WALLACE*

There is nothing in the law, Mr.

6 Chief Justice, that would prevent a member of the Amish
7 faith who is eligible to receive social security payments
8 from receiving those payments and paying them over to a
9 general fund in the community to care for members of the
10 community.

There may be an impediment to doing that in his

11 religious faith, but there is nothing in the law that
12 requires him to receive the benefits at all if he chooses
13 not to receive the benefits.

This is a right protected by

14 the free enterprise clause.
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, I would like to ask you to

16 identify what the compelling interest is of the government
17 in requiring the Amish to pay into the social security
18 system under the stipulated facts, which indicate that the
19 Amish will not be withdrawing from the fund, and there is
20 very little in the record that I can find that would focus
21 on the real impact on the government of allowing them not to
22 pay.
23

MR. WALLACE*

Well, Justice O'Connor, we don’t

24 really, as we view the case, start from the standpoint that
25 we need to show a compelling interest, but however one

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 characterizes that, the interest is really one set forth in
2 one of the classic opinions of Justice Stone, writing for
3 this Court in one of the cases in Volume 301 of the U. S.
4 Reports that upheld the constitutionality of the Social
5 Security Act itself, and that established that the payments
6 as Congress characterized them are taxes, and not insurance
7 premiums, as is sometimes confused, and on Page 28 of our
8 brief, we have set out the key paragraph of that opinion,
•

9 and I would like to, if I may, turn our attention to it,
10 because it seems to me to go to the heart of this case.
11

We don’t really feel that the tax, that Congress's

12 power to tax need be justified in terms of whether the Amish
13 will be withdrawing benefits from the fund, the general fund
14 that is collected, a tax as at that time Mr. Justice Stone
15 said for the Court, "is not an assessment of benefits.

It

16 is a means of distributing the burden of the cost of
17 government.

The only benefit to which a taxpayer is

18 constitutionally entitled is that derived from his enjoyment
19 of the privileges of living in an organized society,
20 established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to
21 public purposes.

Any other view would preclude the levying

22 of taxes except as they are used to compensate for the
23 burden on those who pay them, and would involve the
24 abandonment of the most fundamental principle of government,
25 that it exists primarily to provide for the common good."

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

There are many contributions made in the community

2 at large that contribute toward the maintenance of the way
3 of life that the Amish have fashioned, and that under
4 Wisconsin against Yoder they have a constitutional right to
5 maintain as they choose to fashion it, but the fact is, it
6 is not only through their efforts that that way of life can
7 be maintained.

There are others in the community in general

8 who are willing, for example, to train themselves in the
«

9 advanced technology that is needed to defend the country in
10 today's world, and to protect the constitutional form of
11 government which provides for the free exercise of religion,
12 and others who are willing to serve in the armed forces, et
13 cetera.
14

The fact that the free exercise clause confers

15 upon a community such as the Amish the right to maintain the
16 way of life that they choose to fashion for their community
17 does not negate the obligations they have to the larger
18 community, including the obligation to pay generally
19 applicable taxes on commercial activities.
20

QUESTIONS

How does this square with Thomas of

21 last year?
22

MB. WALLACE;

Well, I realize that in your view,

23 Justice Rehnquist, it probably doesn't.
24

QUESTION;

I don't think, it does, but I mean

25 taking the majority in both cases.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. WALLACES

Well/ I think the burden involved in

2 Thomas, as Justice Brennan pointed out, was of greater
3 magnitude, and here, there is nothing in the payment of
4 taxes that prevents the Amish from maintaining their system
5 of providing for the social welfare of the members of their
6 own community through their own efforts, which is their
7 basic religious teaching, even though the -3

QUESTIONS

The Court — were you finished?
«

9
10

NR. WALLACES
QUESTION;

I am sorry, Nr. Chief Justice.

About 25 years ago — I could not

11 identify the cases — was there not a series of cases of
12 Jehovah's witnesses and other groups, perhaps Quakers, who
13 are strongly opposed to war in any form, who sought to have
14 the aggregate amount of the income taxes levied on them
15 segregated between that part which went to the maintenance
16 of the military and the civilian?

I think the Court did not

17 decide any of them, but regularly certiorari was denied in
18 those cases, for whatever that is worth.
19

HR. WALLACE*

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

20 One of the most prominent of those more recent cases in
21 which certiorari was denied in 1970 is a case in which we
22 have set out a quotation in our reply brief, on Page 3,
23 called Autenrieth v. Cullen.
24

In that case a large number of people with very

25 serious, they claimed, conscientious scruples against the

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 activities that the government was engaged in in Vietnam
2 wished not to pay the share of their income taxes that would
3 be attributed to supporting that activity, and the Court of
4 Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected that claim, and we
5 have quoted a passage of its opinion, and this Court denied
6 certiorari.

There are other cases collected in our

7 principal brief.
3

In a way, this is a more serious claim of
«

9 conscience than we are involved in in this case, and I don’t
10 mean in any way not to respect the claim that is being made
11 here, but there is no claim in this case that the religious
12 views of the Amish are offended by the use to which these
13 moneys will actually be put, to take care of the social
14 welfare problems of other persons in the general community,
15 whereas in many of these other cases in which people have
16 claimed a conscientious scruple against paying taxes, they
17 found it contrary to their conscience to have the money
18 spent the government was planning to spend the money.

Here,

19 the money need not be spent in a way that would offend their
20 religious beliefs, but it is the payment of the tax itself
21 which they construe to be a sin.
22

Now, I do think it is important to keep in mind

23 that while the social security laws do use the word
24 "insurance” and use a trust fund concept, the payments that
25 are involved here have from the beginning been recognized to

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 be taxes and not insurance premiums, as they are sometimes
2 loosely called.

This may be very obvious on the facts of

3 this case in which the payments are due from the employer
4 but the credit is to go toward the account of the employee,

Nonetheless, there can be

Any possible

♦

9 doubt on this subject was dispelled by a decision of this
10 Court not cited in any of the briefs which I want to call to
11 the Court's attention, and I called it to counsel's
12 attention, Fleming against Hester, decided in 1960, 363 US
13 603, which made it clear that there is no accrued property
14 right under the system, that it is, as Congress provided, in
15 a savings provision subject to change and adjustment through
16 the normal exercise of the Article I legislative powers.
17

From the beginning, the cases have construed the

18 payments due as taxes, as Congress characterized them.

ARGUMENT

Very well.

OF FRANCIS X. CAIAZZA, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

2 after listening to the questions asked by the Court and the
3 government's responses thereto, I think I would find it
4 necesary really to depart from the prepared argument that I
5 have made, because I feel that in arguing a question
6 involving — excuse me — questions involving the freedom of
7 religion certainly is a question that has to come from the
3 feelings of the individual practitioner who is arguing the
9 question.
10

Perhaps it is not permissible and proper for an

11 attorney to become so personally involved with a particular
12 issue.

Maybe I have overstepped my bounds.

But I think the

13 Court has to remember in this case that religion is
14 something like beauty.
15 beholder.

Beauty is in the eyes of the

I think that religion is the same thing.

I think

16 religion also has to be in the eyes of the believer.
17 Religion means different things to different people.

To

18 some people, it may mean go to church on Sunday, or the
19 Sabbath.
20 people.

Perhaps it has a social connotation to other

23 about.

That basically is what the Amish people are
It is pretty hard, really, to describe the Amish

24 people without living with them, without going to see them,
25 visiting their homes, talking to them, and I think by doing

QUESTIONS

In the Thomas case last spring, didn't

4 the Court say rather clearly that the judges can't get into
5 the business of parsing out the doctrinal differences within
6 a particular faith?
7

NR. CAIAZZA:

That is true, Mr. Chief Justice, but

8 I think that is very applicable here, too, because I think
*

9 in this particular case, what the government has said, that
10 it is really a sin, they admit that it is a sin on behalf of
11 the Amish

people to pay into the system,

but then what they

12 go on to do is to say, well, that is notthat great of a
13 sin.

The Amish people, pure and simple, live by the Book of

14 Timothy.

The Book of Timothy, of course, paraphrased, says,

15 if you don't take care of your own neighbors, you are worse
16 than an infidel.

That is the basic underlying principle of

17 this particular case.

That is the belief of the Amish

18 people.
19

QUESTION;

But isn't this whole social security

20 system an

organized way for a country of

200 million people

21 to try to

take care of their neighbors in an

organized,

22 institutionalized way?
23

MR. CAIAZZA;

24 exceptions to that.

That is true, but there are

As an example, Federal employees are

25 not part of the social security system.

They have their own

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 system to take care of themselves.

The Amish have their own

2 system, which is the best system I have ever seen.
3 take care of their own.

If they have tragedy, they are

4 there to take care of them.
5

QUESTION*

They

About two weeks ago —

Counsel, does the record show that any

6 employees of these Amish were not Amish?
7

MR. CAIAZZAs

No, all of the employees of Mr. Lee

8 were members of the old order Amish.
9

QUESTION*

Well, of course, the stipulation

10 doesn’t say that in so many words, does it?
11

MR. CAIAZZAs

12 — I think that it does.

No, it does not, but there were no
I think the stipulation states

13 that all of the employees were members of the old order
14 Amish.

Mr. Lee did not employ anybody who was not a member

15 of his own sect.
16

QUESTION*

Mr. Caiazza, I gather from what you

17 have said that if you lose this case, the Amish will not
18 stop following their religious principle which, as you say,
19 underlies this whole belief of taking care of their own.
20

MR. CAIAZZA*

QUESTION*

22

MR. CAIAZZA*

23 their own.
24

They will not — right.

They will continue.
They would continue to take care of

There is no question about that.
QUESTION*

Well, is there anything in the record

25 at all that indicates that the payment of these taxes In any

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

2 own?
3

MR. CAIAZZAi

4 religious belief.

No, but I think it burdens their

I think that is the issue.

Again, they

5 do consider it a very serious sin to pay into the system,
6 because what they are doing is denying their faith in the
7 destiny of God.

They believe very frankly in the destiny of

8 God, that God will —
9

QUESTION:

Does that suggest that it is a sin of

10 such consequence that entirely without reference to their
11 ability to take care of their own, it is an offense to their
12 religion to pay —
13

MR. CAIAZZAs

14 strongly about that.

Yes.

I think — I feel very

I think that once a particular group

15 of individuals such as the Amish establish the fact that
16 certain conduct is sinful, and that opinion is a sincere
17 opinion such as the Amish people have, I don't think this
18 Court or the government or anybody else can question the
19 sincerity of that belief, and attach a sin to it as being
20 mortal or venal in nature.
21

QUESTION:

Well, I didn't understand that the

22 government was questioning at all, and certainly I do not,
23 the sincerity of the belief.
24

MR. CAIAZZA:

They weren't questioning the

25 sincerity of the belief, but they are saying the sin would

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION*

4a political belief.

It wouldn't be that great.

What about the cases that we dicussed
In the Ninth Circuit case, it was really
They were — the objectors were

5 objecting to a particular war.

But in the earlier cases,

6 where the Court declined to review similar holdings, there
7 were religious beliefs asserted against all wars.

Now, that

8 is certainly a profound belief, is it not?
9
10

MR. CAIAZZA*
QUESTIONS

I think it would be.

And yet these people in these religious

11 groups were required to pay their share of the cost of the
12 World War Two and all other military activities.

How do you

13 distinguish that, if you think you need to distinguish it?
14 Because the Court didn't decide it.

We merely decided not
/*

15 to review it.
16

MR. CAIAZZA*

I think I do need to distinguish

17 that, and I think you have to look at the compelling state
18 interest.

I think the compelling state interest in those

19 instances was much different than the compelling staWe
20 interest here.

The government has said that the compelling

21 state interest is the broad participation of indidivduals in
22 the social security laws.

I don't think that — that is

23 what the compelling state interest as far as —
24

QUESTION*

But you do then apparently concede that

25 the government interest may be such in a particular case

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 that would override the free exercise infringement?
2

MR. CAIAZZA*

3

QUESTION*

Very definitely I do.

So that it is a matter of -- you

4 concede it is a matter of balancing the competing interests?
5

MR. CAIAZZAi

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

I think

verydefinitely.

And you simply say it should be

7 balanced in your favor here.
8

MR. CAIAZZAs

9

QUESTION*

Yes, I do.

10

MR. CAIAZZA*

11 different.
12

What about the Federal income tax?
I think the Federal income tax is

I think that the argument has been made —
QUESTION*

If it were a sin under some religious

13 beliefs to pay the income tax, would you say that the income
14 tax could nevertheless be collected?
15

MR. CAIAZZA*

Yes.

Again, Ithink

you have to

16 distinguish again between social security and the federal
17 income tax.
18

QUESTION*

And the

19

MR. CAIAZZA*

property tax?

The Amish people pay all taxes.

20 They pay income taxes, they pay all property taxes, they pay
21 every tax you and I pay.
22

QUESTION*

Are any of those deemed — Is the

23 payment of any of those taxes deemed to be a sin?
24

MR. CAIAZZA*

25

QUESTION*

No.

Mr. Caiazza, suppose we come to the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 day, as from reading the newspapers we may, when we have to
2 fund the social security system in part, at least, out of
3 general income taxes?
4

What then would be the Amish position

MR. CAIAZZAs

I think that is, of course, a

5 different case than we have here, but I think that -- again,
6 I think they would have to take the position that it would
7 still be a sin.

I think if that happens, I think you have

8 the compelling state interest shifting.
9

QUESTION;

You are familiar, I know, with the

10 polygamy decisions and the peyote decisions and the like —
11

MR.

CAIAZZA; Yes, I am.

12

QUESTION;

— where because of their illegality,

13 as I recall it, those cases held that free exercise was not
14 protected.
15

MR.

CAIAZZA; Yes, sir.

16

QUESTION;

How do you distinguish those cases?

17 Non-payment of FUTA and FICA taxes is a crime, isn’t it?
18

MR.

CAIAZZA; That’s true.

19

QUESTION;

20

MR.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR.

It can be a crime?

CAIAZZA; Yes, it can be.
How do you distinguish those old cases?

CAIAZZA; Because I think again, we have to

23 again, I think, look at the compelling state interest.

I

24 think that the crimes such as you have cited, if they were
25 permissible under the laws of our country, I think it could

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 lead to chaos.

I don't think that is true as far as the

2 Amish people are

concerned, when youconsider the social

3 security tax and

the number of Amish people that you have in

4 this country.
5

QUESTION*

6 people practiced

How can you say there would be chaos if

the Mormon faith asit was

7 ago, where it was a sin not

some decades

to take several wives, for

8 example?

Would that cause chaos?

9

MB. CAIAZZA*

Well, maybe I shouldn't use the word

10 "chaos", but what I —
11

QUESTION*

Or say they smoke the peyote in a

12 ritual periodically.

Would that cause chaos if it were

13 permitted?
14

MR. CAIAZZA*

No, I don't think it would cause

15 chaos, and I would like to back up on that statement, but I
16 think that — certainly I think that the result of the
17 practice of polygamy in this country would be much different
18 than the law not requiring the Amish people to pay into the
19 social security system.
20

QUESTION*

Does your case turn on the fact that

21 they will not participate in the benefits, do you think?
22

MR. CAIAZZA*

They never — they do not

23 participate in the benefits.
24

QUESTION*

Well, how can you guarantee that the

25 employees might not at some time be non-members of the sect

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 or might leave the sect before they become eligible for
2 benefits ?
3

MB. CAIAZZA:

4

QUESTION:

They may leave the sect —

Because there are people who leave the

5 faith, are there not?
6

MB. CAIAZZA:

Yes, there are, very definitely.

7 There are people that leave the faith.

But I think when you

8 read Mr. Chief Justice Burger’s opinion in the Yoder case,
9 he alludes very clearly to the fact that the Amish children
10 in the Yoder case had to be protected, that if they went to
11 school beyond the eighth grade in that particular case, that
12 they would be taught the ways of the world, and I think the
13 same thing is true here as far as — the same reasoning
14 applies as far as the social security is concerned.

If you

15 make social security payments eligible, if you make the
16 Amish people eligible to receive social security, that is
17 there for them to receive, they may receive it and then deny
18 their faith.

That is what some of the older Amish people

19 are concerned about, and I think rightly so.
20

QUESTION:

In other words, the taxpayer here is

21 concerned about protecting his employees from the temptation
22 of accepting welfare benefits later on?
23

MB. CAIAZZA:

Yes, I would think so, and I think

24 that same reasoning applies in the Yoder case, as far as the
25 temptation of students going to school beyond the eighth

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 grade, and I think, that is what the parents in Yoder were
2 concerned about, and that is what the Amish employers are
3 concerned about —
4

QUESTION:

What would happen if another religion

5 pops up?

We would have to change again, wouldn't we?

6

NR. CAIAZZA:

I don't think that is a concern.

If

7 another religion -8

QUESTION:

Why not?

9

MR. CAIAZZA:

If another religion such as the

10 Amish popped up, I think the same reasoning would apply.
11

QUESTION:

I didn't say such as the Amish.

12 Another religion would pop up and say, it's a sin to pay
13 income tax.
14

MR. CAIAZZA:

I think that the Amish people date

15 back —
16

QUESTION:

I am not talking about old.

17

MR. CAIAZZA:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CAIAZZA:

Well, I —

They would say, we date back, too.
Yes, they would date back, and that

20 same reasoning could apply.
21

QUESTION:

And we would have how many different

22 tax systems in this country?
23

MR. CAIAZZA:

24

QUESTION:

I just don’t think that that —

Well, isn’t everybody is striving for a

25 uniform tax system.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. CAIAZZA;

I can’t see where that is a reality

2 in this particular case, because I don't think —
3

QUESTIONS

Why isn’t it a reality if we say, you

4 are just like everybody else?
5

BR. CAIAZZA:

Because I think that the Amish

6 people predate back to the 16th century in Switzerland.
7 They came to this country for religious freedom.

They have

8 established this history from the 16th century.
9

QUESTION:

Didn’t some other people come here for

10 religious freedom, too?
11

BR. CAIAZZA:

I understand that, but I think that

12 the Amish people can predate their history back to the 16th'
13 century.

If there is another religious faith —

14

QUESTION:

You are not asking that the Amish

15 people be given a preferred status under the First
16 Amendment, are you?
17

BR. CAIAZZA:

18

QUESTION:

No, I am not.

But certainly the Amish and the Mormon

19 faith both go back a long way in their belief that a
20 practice proscribed by the Congress was illegal.
21

BR. CAIAZZA:

22

QUESTION:

That’s true.

And nonetheless, this Court sustained

23 the Congressional action.
24

MR. CAIAZZA:

Yes.

I think again if we are going

25 back to the compelling state interest, I think that is what

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is important here.

I think we have to look at the

2 compelling state interest, and you have to, I think, ask
3 your question whether or not the state interest is
4 justified.

In my opinion, it is not justified in this

5 particular case when we look at the Amish payment into the
6 social security system.
7

QUESTIONS

How do we decide whether a compelling

8 state interest is justified^or not?

Do the nine of us just

9 get in a room and flip a coin?
10

HH. CAIAZZAs

Hell, I think you have to look at

11 what the purpose of the social security system is.

I think

12 this is where the. compelling state interest comes into
13 play.

The Amish people take care of themselves.

I think

14 the compelling state interest is whether or not the Amish
15 people as a group have the means to care for themselves.
16 They have taken care of that compelling state interest
17 themselves.
18

I think that is what is important.

They do have a system whereby they take care of

19 their older people, they take care of their younger people,
20 their sick people.

They do it themselves.

2 to take care of older people, aged people, people that are
3 disabled.

They do that themselves.

They have taken care of

4 the compelling state interest themselves with their own
5 actions and by their own beliefs based upon their belief in
6 God and the destiny of God.
7

QOESTIOR«

I take it what you are saying to us is

3 that they have their own little social security system and
9 insurance within their own church organization.
10

SB. CAIAZZAs

11

QUESTIONS

They do.

Well, now, what is to prevent them from

12 having all the returns which come to individual Amish paid
13 into that fund?

Would that be regarded as tainted money,

14 because it has gone into the government and back into the
15 Amish fund?
16

SR. CAIAZZAs

I would think that it would be,

17 because I think that what they are doing by paying into the
18 system is denying their belief in the destiny of God.

That

19 is what is important.
20

QUESTIONS

Well, when they get it back, haven't

21 they washed that out?
22

SR. CAIAZZAs

They don't really take care of each

23 other, though, by the use of moneys.

What they do is, they

24 take care of each other by the use of their physical labor.
25

QUESTIONS

They must use money, too, I would think.

MR. CAIAZZAs

They definitely do.

Of course, they

2 need money, like anybody else, in order to subsist, but I
3 think that the — I think that the important situation is
4 the fact that when they do pay into the system, what they
5 are doing is denying their belief that their future is
6 guided by the destiny of God.
7

QUESTION;

Mr. Caiazza, I am not clear yet whether

8 you would take the same position you are taking if the
9 employees were not Amish.

Would it still be a sin to pay

10 the tax, the social security tax?
11

MR. CAIAZZAs

If the employee of Mr. Lee was not

12 Amish ?
13

QUESTION*

Correct.

14

MR. CAIAZZAs

All right.

The employer, of course,

15 has his half to pay and the employee has his half to pay.
16

QUESTION:

Yes.

So would your argument still be

17 that it is a sin to pay the tax?
18

MR. CAIAZZAs

I think it would be a sin to pay the

It would not be a sin to pay the

20 employee’s half.

As a matter of practicality, the Amish

They are a very close-knit

But it would be your position that even

24 if non-Amish employees were hired, that it would still

BR. CAIAZZA;

QUESTION:

Yes, it would

Now, would that not in effect mean that

3 the government is running into establishment clause
4 problems, and is in effect favoring the Amish and enabling
5 them to compete in a manner that other people don’t have to
6 contend with?
7

BR. CAIAZZA:

Of course, there is a lot of tension

8 between the establishment clause and the free exercise
9 clause.

I think when you consider the number of Amish

10 people there are in this country, I think when you consider
11 their general practices of Amish people working together and
12 not employing members who are not members of the old order
13 Amish, I don't think you really run into that question.
14

If the situation did arise whereby an Amishraan did

15 hire an individual who was not a member of the Amish faith,
16 yes, you would have a problem, but as a matter of
17 practicality, that just does not come up because they are a
18 very close community.
19

QUESTION:

They stay within their own bounds.
Wouldn't you have a similar problem of

20 larger magnitude if the government chose to tax, say, the
21 wine that people of Jewish faith use in their religious
22 rituals, or the people of the Christian faith use in their
23 religious rituals?
24

BR. CAIAZZA:

If you would tax the wine that they

25 use?

I really don't know how to answer

I would say that, yes, you would, if there

4 were taxes that was placed upon the wine that, let's say,
5 was used, at a Catholic mass.

I would not know the resaon

6 for legislation such as that, but I think that you could run
7 into the same problem if there were taxes placed upon the
3 wine.

Perhaps the problem becomes more paramount if the

9 Catholic priest couldn't buy the wine because of the tax.

But if he could

QUESTION:

Counsel, many people think it is

16 immoral to fund abortions from the Medicaid component of
17 social security.

Do you think they would have the same

Certainly they would have the same

I would hate to comment myself on

3 that they would have the right to present that issue, but
4 again I think we get back to the compelling state interest.
5

QUESTION:

It would have a devastating effect on

6 the social security tax, at least on the Medicaid component.
7 if that view prevailed, wouldn't it?
8

MR. CAIAZZA:

9

I realize that probably the greatest problem with

Yes,• sir.

10 this case is the fact that we are dealing with taxes.

Of

11 course, social security, I feel, in my mind, is more of an
12 insurance than a tax.

Of course, the name of the Act is the

13 Federal Insurance Contribution Act.

It is set up in a trust

14 fund, and I think that the moneys are distributed basically
15 the same way that insurance carriers distribute annuity
16 funds.

QUESTION:

What about that old decision of Justice

Wrong?

MR. CAIAZZA:

QUESTION:

21

MR. CAIAZZA:

Well, I would have to say that —

It was wrong.
Of course, that does present

22 problems, but I think that again —
23

QUESTION:

Well, Fleming is against you, too, on

24 that point, isn't it?
25

MR. CAIAZZA:

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONi

That is wrong, too.

Right?

You say

2 that is wrong, too?
3

MR. CAIAZZA*

I would say, yes, in my opinion, it

^ is.
5

QUESTION*

Well, then, just to make it clear, you

6 do take the position that if social security were financed
7 out of general revenues, that you could make the same
3 argument about the regular income tax?
i-

9

MR. CAIAZZAt

I don't really think so.

I think if

10 social security was financed out of general revenues, I
11 think your compelling state interest would be different.
12 Social security funds are set aside.

Many of the Amish

13 people are against many social welfare programs that are
14 really financed by general revenues which come from income
15 tax which they pay, but I don't think that it would be fair
16 or proper to place on the government the responsibility to
17 distinguish where everybody's tax dollar goes on a dollar by
18 dollar basis.
19

That is not true as far as the Social Security Act

20 is concerned.

The money goes into the system and is paid

21 out of the system.
22

QUESTION*

You are saying the legal question will

23 be different, but would it not be equally a sin for the
24 Amish to pay income tax if the income tax were used to
25 finance welfare programs that would be available to some

MR. CAIAZZA4

Yes.

I think — I think that it

3 would also be — it also could be a sin, but I think again —
4

QUESTION*

Could be?

It would be, if I understand

5 you.
6

MR. CAIAZZA*

It would be a sin, but I think you

7 get back again to the compelling state interest.
8

QUESTION*

Then you are saying the governmental
*

9 interest would override.
10

MR. CAIAZZAs

It would override it.

That is my

11 position.
12

I forgot where I was.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Wallace?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

16

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

17

MR. WALLACE*

Very well.

I just would like to point out

18 Footnote 11 of our brief, which shows that we long since
19 have reached the point that Mr. Justice Brennan posed in a
20 question where federal funds out of the general revenues are
21 being used for social welfare programs, such as the aid to
22 families with dependent children program, but also they are
23 being used for a supplemental program within the Social
24 Security Act itself that we have documented there.
25

Other than that, we will rest on our brief, unless
