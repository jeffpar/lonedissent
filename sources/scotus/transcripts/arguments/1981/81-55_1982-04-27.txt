CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. PITLER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PITLER*

7
8

Mr. Chief Justce, and may it

please the Court*

9

The issue in this case is whether New York can

10

make it a crime to disseminate materials, for example, a

11

movie, which show a

12

sex with an animal or an adult without requiring that

13

the entire movie be obscene.

12-year old child actually having

The purpose of this kind of legislation is, of

14
15

course, to protect children from sexual abuse.

This

16

purpose distinguishes this case and New York Penal Law

17

Section 263.15 from the obscenity cases and statutes

18

which have previously come before this Court.
In the previous cases, in the obscenity cases,

19

20 the interests of the state are generally to protect the
21

viewer, not to protect the people who participated in

22

the film.

25

in support of general obscenity legislation, and all of

That much is made clear by the opinion for

In that case three state interests were mentioned

1 those interests, without going into them, are aimed at
2

protecting the viewer or the community from seeing the

3

film.

4

Indeed, the obscenity standard itself is

5

designed, in talking of terms of community standards,

6

appeal to the prurient interests, the standard itself is

7

designed to protect the viewer.

8
9

Here, the statute in question is not at all
designed to protect the viewer.

You know, one can say,

10

pardon the expression, in terms of obscenity legislation

11

to some extent you deal with a victimless crime.

12

statute and the concern here, we are not dealing with a

13 victimless crime.

He are dealing with a crime against a

14

child who is made to perform any and every kind of

15

sexual conduct by an adult.

18 profound adverse effect upon him, and that adverse

21

brief about all the damage that is done to children.

22

And I am not going

And the harm to children is not limited to the

23

production process itself.

The child's privacy when he

24

is made to appear in that film is forever invaded.

25

knows in his mind that he is on that film and thatfilm

He

1

is being disseminated all throughout the United States.

2

The embarrassment caused to him, the emotional and

3

psychic trauma to him is quite grave.

4

Now, our adversaries recognize that the state

5

interest here is compelling at least with respect to the

6

production part of the statute, in prohibiting people

7

from using children in production of the materials.

8

There is no challenge to that part of the statute.

9

But once the production is completed and the

10

sexual abuse, as we call it and I think properly so, is

11

memorialized on film, our adversaries say the First

12

Amendment then comes into play and you may not prohibit

13

the dissemination of that material even though it was

14

committed by committing a crime against a child.

15

say this is especially so, because there are less

16

restrictive ways to deal with the problem than an

17

outright ban on dissemination.

18
19

They point to two.

They

One less restrictive way

they think of dealing with the problem involved here is

20 the production statute itself.

It is good enough just

21

to ban the use of children.

He submit to the Court that

22

that is not an effective alternative to the

23

dissemination statute.

24

effective alternative, thd dissemination statute, is

25

because most of the production is done secretly.

And the reason it is not an

2

difficult to infiltrate, very difficult to find.
QUESTION;

3

The producers are very, very

Your submission is that the

4

dissemination prohibition is essential to supplement the

5

production prohibition, which you say you can validly do.
MR. PITLER;

6

Yes.

In effect, it is part of a

7

statutory scheme which is designed to protect children,

8

and you cannot protect children just by the production

9

statute.

10

QUESTION*

Well, how can you — then how do

11

you — I am sure you will get to this sooner or later

12

and you may do it in your own course if you want to, but

13

how do you explain then your prohibition of distribution

14

on production that has taken place outside the state?

15

That certainly is not as a supplement to any kind of

16

production that you are legally authorized to prohibit.

17

MR. PITLER*

Well, one of the problems is that

18

you cannot determine where the production takes place in

19

a lot of these films.

20

— they don’t have a list of credit —

21

QUESTION;

It*s impossible.

They don’t say

But suppose it’s quite possible.

22

Suppose in a particular case everybody concedes the

23

production took place in California.

Then what’s your

MR. PITLER;

We would say that those films, in

that children in New York would be used to make other

films.

1

The second alternative to the dissemination

2

ban of New York is the obscenity standard.

In effect,

3

limit the ban on dissemination to materials that are

4

obscene.
We believe that most theoretically and

5

6

realistically, that does not work.

7

matter of theory, as I said in my opening remarks, the

8

obscenity statute is designed, and the standards that

9

this Court has enunciated, is designed to protect the

10

First of all, as a

viewer, not the child who is made to perform.
Moreover, even a work is not obscene in the

12

legal definition, a child has been abused in the

13

production of that work.

14

fact.

15

submit, is not a sufficient deterrent to deal with this

16

particular kind of issue.

17

obsenity standard requires you look at community

18

standards, to the prurient interests, to whether there’s

19

a particular group involved.

20

You cannot get away from that

And moreover, the obscenity standard, we would

And I think no case better illustrates why

21

this is an ineffective deterrent than the instant case.

22

The defendant here was charged with both disseminating

23

an obscene move and just disseminating a movie

24

containing sexual conduct of a child.

25

with respect to the obscenity on charges.

He was acquitted
And if you

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

read the record, I thought that this would be a

2

relatively simple case.

You show the film to the jury

3 — I don't know if the Court has seen the film yet but
4

it is in the courthouse and it would be relatively

5

simple.
The entire trial was devoted in this case,

6

7 despite the fact that these films were entirely devoted
8

to sexual conduct, to — does this appeal to the

9 prurient interest of a particular group?

Now, I would

10

think when a child is abused in the making of a film,

11

society shouldn't be interested in whether or not the

12

film appeals to the prurient interst of a particular

13 group.

We shouldn't be interested in whether there are

14 other films out there similar to this film that are sold
15 regularly.

And we shouldn't be concerned about any

16 particular group.
17

The jury was out approximately 12 hours in

18 this case, all focusing on — all their questions show
19 they were focusing on the obscenity question.

No, Your Honor.

films, it is virtually impossible to see where they are

2

made.
QUESTION;

3

And there was no proof in this case

4

about that, I gather.

5

MB. PITLER;

At one time there was an offer of

6

proof that they wanted to prove that the film was made

7

in Europe, and the judge rejected that saying that was

8

not relevant to the statutory scheme, for the reasons

9

that I gave Justice White, in order to deter the abuse

10

in New York.
QUESTION*

11
12

I take it you were surprised at the

verdict.
MR. PITLER*

13

I didn't try the case, but upon

14

reading the trial transcript, I was not surprised at the

15

verdict.

16
17
18

QUESTION;

You were not surprised at the

acquittal on the one count and —
MR. PITLER*

No, because so much confusion was

19

caused between the experts on the group involved, that

20

I'm not sure the jury could follow any intelligent

21

instructions with respect to that.

22

QUESTION*

Well, can't that also be explained

23

under the ancient proposition of inconsistent verdicts,

24

which the system has found tolerable?

25

expected consistent verdicts, necessarily, from the —

people, but inconsistent verdicts are part of the system.
MR. PITLER;

Well actually, I think the

That is certainly true, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

May I just clarify one thing?

Is

8

it correct that there were two films and as to each film

9

there was a charge both on the obscene section of the

10

statute, and also on the non-obscene statute.

11

MR. PITLER*

12

QUESTIOBs

13

So it’s kind of like a lesser

included defense.

14

MR. PITLER*

15

QUESTION;

16

all four counts?

Could that verdict have stood?

MR. PITLER;

18

QUESTION*

20

Ho.
What if they found him guilty on

17

19

That is correct.

Yes.

I think —

That the film had been both obscene

and not obscene?
MR. PITLER*

No, they wouldn't have to — in

21

other words, obscenity would be irrelevant.

say that the theme of the film is obscene -- I have to

What is your view of the statute?

4

Supposing the films had been obscene.

5

they could be convicted under all four counts?

6

to me there's kind of a double punishment problem there,

7

MR. PITLER:

No.

Your view is that
It seems

In New York you would only

8

have a double punishment problem if they were served —

9

if consecutive sentences were to be imposed.

You would

10

have what I think we call a multiplicity.

11

remedy with respect to multiplicity is you do not allow

the sentences to be increases.

would not have to prove the film

QUESTION*

I understand.

3

HR. PITLERs

But you could.

Yes, you could violate the

4

statute.

But it's the problem of the proof of obscenity

5

is why the legislature did away —

6

QUESTION*

I understand, I understand.

7

MR. PITLERs

How, it may well be that when

8 we're dealing with protecting the viewer in the
9 obscenity context, that we're prepared to pay the price
10 of standards that may not effectively deter abuse.
11

In

that circumstance, as I said before, we're sort of

12 dealing with a victimless crime.
13
14

But I don't think when we're dealing with
protection of children, that the New York legislature

15 decide and I would hope this Court would hold, that we
16 have to run the risk of acquittals in having an
17

ineffective deterrent to the abuse of children.
That brings us to the statute on its face.

18
19

Now, one of the problems before this Court is that the

20 New York Court of Appeals held that obscenity was like a
21

threshold question.

If the statute didn't require proof

22 of obscenity, the statute was unconstitutional, and
23

therefore, there*d be no limiting construction

24

possible.

25

constructions or even go to it, because they said

They didn't deal with any proposed limiting

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

obscenity was the bottom line.

2

What I'd like to do is to go through the

3

statute and at least show why, on its face, the statute

4

is not over-broad, and in the course of that, to at

5

least offer some potential limiting constructions that

6

the New York Court of Appeals might and probably would

7

consider.

8
9
10

First, -- and it is 263.15 of New York's Penal
law and it is found, I believe, on page 3a of the
Appendix to our brief.
Now, we have shorthanded the statute a little

11

12

bit, but basically, it prohibits dissemination of

13

material depicting the sexual conduct of children.

14

the sexual conduct we think is defined in pretty precise

15

terms.

16

lewd display of the genitals, explicit simulated — any

17

of the conduct simulated.

And

It's bestiality, sexual intercourse, sodomy,

And if these terms sound

18 familiar, they certainly are because they are right from
19

the Miller versus California standard talking about the

20 hardcore kind of sexual conduct that could be prohibited
21
22

in the obscenity context.
Now, amici and our adversary have suggested

23 that the term "lewd display of the genitals" is vague
24

and that would deal with just simple nudity.

I think

25 that a reading of this Court's opinion in the Hiller

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case and the Paris Art Theater case and the New York

2

Court of Appeals case in People versus Heller shows that

3

that concern is totally unwarranted.
Now, it's true the New York court has not yet

4
5

had a chance to interpret the statute, but lewd

6

exhibition or lewd display of the genitals, at least as

7

far as this Court is concerned and the New York court is

8

concerned, feels it a patently offensive depiction,

9

designed to appeal to an interest in sex.
Now, the amici point to medical texts saying

10
11

these medical texts would be covered by this statute.

12

But I don't think there is any way, I don't think any

13

reasonable person, I don't think any prosecutor, I don't

14

think any jury, I don't think any judge and I don't

15

think any bookseller can really look at a medical text

16

and think for a second that that is a lewed display of

17

the genitals within the meaning of the statute.
QUESTION;

18

Br. Pitler, can I interrupt you

19

there?

At page 3a of the jurisdictional statement — or

20

I guess it is the cert petition rather — there's a

21

paragraph in which the court of appeals describes what

22

it says the statute covers.

23

says it covers is just what you have described.

24

says, "It would also prohibit the sale, showing or

25

distributing of medical or educational materials

And one of the things it

Judge, I think that they were

dealing with the statute on its face, saying, in effect,

QUESTIONS

5
6

Haven't they construed their own

statute?
HR. PITLER*

7

Judge, I don't think that you can

8

read the court of appeals' decision as construing their

9

own statute because I think even though they said that,

10

I don't think they were focusing on lewd display of the

11

genitals at the time.

12

inconsistent with their own decision in People versus

13

Heller.

14

They would have to find it

And I think a fair reading of the opinion,

15

which I must say, in all deference to the court of

16

appeals, not one of the great exhibits of judicial

17

craftsmanship.

18

statute — we will allow you — I was going to say

19

hopefully, this case will go back to.the court and I am

20

perfectly prepared to tell that to them during the

21

argument as well.

22

Because they were saying look, the

But I think that they were concerned about the

23

obscenity part of the statute, the absence.

24

said look, obscenity is not covered by this statute, and

25

that everything else just follows.

And they

I don't think they

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

were really focusing on it.

2

even our brief or in our adversary's brief really

3

focusing on the term "lewd display of the genitals" at

4

the time before the court of appeals.
QUESTION;

5

And indeed, I don't recall

Well maybe they were careless and

6

didn't look at the word "lewd" as carefully as they

7

should have.

8

what they think the statute prohibits.

9

crazy for them to read it that way, but can we reread a

10

But it seems to me that paragraph tells us
And maybe that's

New York statute differently?
HR. PITLER;

11

No, clearly not.

But I would

12

urge Your Honor to read the opinion in its whole and

13

entirety.

14

is that the court did not focus on that issue, and their

— mention that, but I think a fair reading

15

QUESTION;

16

Well, they clearly did not focus on

17

the meaning of the word "lewd", I agree with you

18

completely.
HR. PITLER;

19

And if we are right, if they say

20

you must prohibit obscenity and only obscenity, and this

21

Court says no, the state can go further, this case could

22

go back to the New York Court of Appeals for them to

23

decide precisely how they think "lewd" should be

24

defined.

25

to urge the court that lewd has to be defined exactly as

And I can assure Your Honor that we are going

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

we have suggested to this Court, and that's the way it

2

should be defined.
And I think if the case goes back and the

3
4

court decides to give a limiting construction, that is

5

precisely what the court will hold.

6

held yet.

7

literally might cover that, I think you have to read a

just not a real threat, at least with respect to the

situations that they posit.

MR. FAHRINGER*

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court*
It is our view that if this statute is

13

resurrected, it would mark an abrupt departures from an

14

unbroken series of cases extending over a long stretch

15

of this Court’s history, holding as postulate the

16

proposition that whenever any law is conceded, as this

17

one is, to suppress constitutionally-protected material,

18

or non-obscene material, despite the compelling state

19

interest, where there are available alternatives less

20

restrictive, it has never been tolerated.

21

It is my view, Your Honors, that the New York

22

Court of Appeals condemned this statute because it

23

imposed significant burdens on freedom of speech without

24

any assurances that it would give any added protection

25

adds further harm to the children.

those films would be found obscene and they would be

really think this is the core of our argument — and

that is, the statutes that are on the books of New York

MR. FAHRINGER*
Your Honor.

Under state law, that’s right,

Under our Hew York. State Constitution.

QUESTION*

Does that add weight, then, to the

4

state’s argument that this kind of a statute is

5

necessary under those circumstances to reach the problem?

6

MR. FAHRINGERt

I don't think so. Your Honor,

7

because all — all we come back to, it seems to me, is

8

that everything we're talking about in this Court would

9

be found obscene under the obscenity statute.

10

One of the things that is disturbing to me is

11

the prosecution hasn’t come forward with any figures,

12

any statistics of any kind to indicate that we simply

13

cannot go forward with these prosecutions without this

14

third section.

15

tried 37 child pornography cases and we have only been

16

able to get two convictions.

There's no statistics here that we’ve

And I don’t know of any

17 other statistics across the country.
18

The few Law Review articles that are cited are

19

really very self-serving and they're speculative by

20

people who have views in the industry.

21

me the only way to go about that in a logical fashion is

22

to say that we can’t get — 26 states apparently feel

23

that they can conduct this campaign against child

24

pornography successfully with what they've got, and the

25

federal government feels that way.

But it seems to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Now that, I think, lends force to my position

2

here today that until they come in and show this court,

3

we simply cannot prosecute child pornographers unless we

4

have this third arm, it seems to me that recognizing

5

that it imperils all this other literature, it seems —

6

QUESTION;

But they obviously wanted to go

7

further and prosecute some who were not child

8

pornographers but who violated this third portion of the

statute.

I mean, the evil they were striking at was

10

broader than the child pornography in the sense of the

11

constitutionally obscene.

12
13

NR. FAHRINGERs

And what I’m saying in answer

to that. Your Honor, because I think that is an incisive

14 question.

One is if it's the protected material, that

15 they are never going to go after the books and things of
16 that sort, obviously there’s never going to be a
17

prosecution under the so-called legitimate material.

18

If it's the other material, that is the 42nd

19

Street Times Square material, that's going to be found

20 obscene under the obscenity doctrine anyway.
21

QUESTION*

Except in the one case in which

22 you've just successfully or partially successfully
23

tried, where they found it not obscene but convicted him

that's the case, it seems to me, you need, not a case

where it would appeal to a deviant group.

interests could not be met by methods that are less

20

you said — and I think it applies to this case — that

21

even if the infringement is incidental and only applies

22

to a small number of cases in the First Amendment area,

23

we must still scrutinize that regulation with great care

to see whether or not there are other methods available

to reach the state's objective.

because there, what you said in Erznozkik with the

drive-in theater that they only picked nudist films to

foreclose --

QUESTION*

That's a content-oriented thing.

6

MR. FAHRIHGER:

Content-oriented.

7

that's what this basically is. Your Honor,

8

content-oriented.

9

QUESTION*

Well,

I don't know about that.

10

MR. FAHRIHGER*

11

In any event, there was an awful lot of

12

preoccupation in the court of appeals with that phase of

13 it.
14

The distribution part is.

And what I wanted to simply state, the court of

appeals said it seems as though they just selected this

15 one narrow area because of the legislator's distate for
16 this type of material.
17

Your Honors, I'll end as I began, by simply

18 saying that it really seems to me the evidence in this
19

case is compelling, and there's none to the contrary,

20 that the two statutes that are in existence in New York
21

are more than adequate to deal with this problem.

22

it's unnecessary to impose significant restrains on free

23 speech where there are existing alternatives.

QUESTION*

And

Thank you

Hr. Fahringer, let me ask you one

25 question before you sit down.

I take it this statute

has no civil sanctions or remedies of any kind for this

kind of material.

3

MB. FAHRINGERi

4

QUESTION:

No, it doesn't. Your Honor.

Would you say that the constitution

5

would tolerate some kind of civil control of this sort

6

of material, the distribution of it?

7

HR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, I would

8

still have some problems with that if it were going to

9

— if it is civil or not, it seems to me it has a

10

deterrent effect, and I would think that it could run

11

afoul of the First Amendment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. PITLER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~ Rebuttal

16

MR. PITLER:

Thank you.

Hay it please the

17

Court, Mr. Chief Justice, let me turn to the

18

under-inclusive argument first.

19

In Erznoznik, you didn't have a situation like

20

you have here.

Here you have a market that's being fed,

21

a dissemination market that's being fed.

22

you can get at that market is to ban the dissemination

23

of these materials.

respect to that market at all, and therefore, the

legislature had a very good reason for choosing —

HR. PITLER;

6

And if you were a state

7 legislator you could, and the New York state legislature
8 did find out and they did make that determination.

And

9 it seems to me that that’s a pretty good finding.
QUESTION*

20

Did they find the volume of the

21

business and so forth?

statute?

23

HR. PITLER;

Or did they just pass the

No.

There, if you look at what

24 we call the bill jacket, you will see comments from
25 various legislators that they had hearings.

they were shown any number of films that were freely

produced in the market —

I understand.

But your argument is

that these other statutory provisions are not an

6

adequate solution to the problem.

HR. PITLERs

QUESTIONS

That's correct. Your Honor.
And those comments were made before

9 these other statutory provisions were passed.

I mean,

10

how do we know how much of the job would have been

11

accomplished by the prohibition against the obscene

12

materials and the prohibition against the non-obscene

13

performances?

how to

Judge, I can't prove it

empirically, it's true.

But it seems to me that a

18 legislature is entitled to make some findings based on
19

the information that is available to them.

make a finding.
I might say that our adversaries have never
