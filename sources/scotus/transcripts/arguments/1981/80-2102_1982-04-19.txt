ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY R. KAROL,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. KAROL:

ESQ.,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the question in these two consolidated

11

cases is whether an ostensibly private school which is

12

retained by the state to discharge the state's

13

obligation to provide special education acts under color

14

of law when it dismisses several of its teachers for

15

criticizing the manner in which that education is

16

provided.
t

17

Petitioners are six former teachers and

18

counselors at Respondent New Perspectives School in

19

Brookline, Massachusetts.

20

dismissed for fulfilling their professional duty to

21

speak out on school matters affecting the education of

22

their students.

23

They allege they were

Although the school is ostensibly private,

all

24

50 of its students were placed there by state agencies

25

or local school committees under the Massachusetts

program was prescribed by public officials.

Each child's educational
State

3 agencies or local school committees also paid each
4 child's tuition, with the result that as much as 99
5 percent of the school's operating funds were derived
6

7

from public sources.
Thus, the school had no students except those

8

which had been placed there by public officials.

It had

9

virtually no operating funds except those which had been

10

provided by public officials.

It was contractually

11

obligated to implement educational programs prescribed

12

by public officials, and it had no function except to

13 discharge the Commonwealth's own obligation to provide
14 special education to students which public officials had
15 placed at the school.
16

QUESTION:

Who owns the building and

t

17 properties?
18

MR. KAROL:

The building and properties are

19 privately owned by the school's trustees.
20

QUESTION;

Who selects the teachers?

21

MR. KAROL:

The teachers are selected by the

22 school management, including the directors and the

23 executive director of the school.
24

QUESTION:

Are any of them public officials?

25

MR. KAROL:

No.

2

Under the circumstances of this case#
Petitioners submit that the school is subject to the

3 same constitutional obligations as an ordinary public
4

school in connection with the performance of its

5

educational activities.

6

To place the issue into its proper context# it

7

is important to understand more fully the statutory

8

scheme under which special education is provided in

9

Massachusetts.

Chapter 766 of the Acts of 1972 confers

10

upon every school aged child the statutory right to

11

receive suitable# publicly funded education.

12

is suspected of having special learning needs, he is

13

evaluated by a team of educators, physicians, and

14

psychologists appointed by the state.

15

determines that the child does have special learning

If a child

If the team

16 needs, then it formulates an individualized educational
/

17

plan or IEP to meet those needs.

18

The IEP establishes educational objectives for

19

the child, and sets out in detail an educational program

20

designed to achieve those objectives.

21

must be implemented by the child’s regular public school

22

to the fullest extent possible.

By law, the IEP

If the regular public

23 school is unable to implement the IEP, then but only
24

then may the school committee place the child in a

25

specially accredited private school, such as the

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Respondent in this case

2

The school must agree to implement the IEP and

3 to submit to extensive state regulation and inspection.
4 It must also report periodically on the child's
5 progress, with a view toward returning him to the public
6

school as soon as possible.

For its part, the school

7 committee must pay each child’s tuition, and it also
8

must monitor the child's progress and the school’s

9 performance.
10

The school committee also has an ongoing

11

obligation to revise the child's IEP as the need

12

arises.

If the regular public school is unable to

13 implement the IEP, and if the school committee is unable
14 to locate a suitable private school which is willing and
15 able to do so, then by law the school committee must
16 establish a suitable program of its own.
t

17

So, in short, every school aged child has an

18 unconditional right to suitable education, and the
19 Commonwealth has an absolute duty to provide it.

It is

20

also significant that school attendance was made

21

compulsory under Chapter 766 for children entitled to

22

special educational benefits.

23

This, then, was the statutory scheme under

24 which state agencies or local school committees provided
25 the school with all of its students and virtually all of

statutory law of Kassachusetts?

HR. KAROL*

I don't know of any disagreement

that they expressed with any of these positions.
The dismissals which gave rise to the

8

litigation were all alleged to have been in retaliation

9

for Petitioner's speech critical of school policies and

10

administration.

11

these facts which, as I have noted, the First Circuit

12

assumed to be true for purposes of its opinion, that

13

Petitioners maintain that the school is subject to the

14

It must meet the state standards?

MR. KAROL*

We think that there is a critical

20

difference in this case.

An ordinary private school is

21

not discharging an obligation of the Commonwealth or of

22

the state when it provides education, because the

23

children who attend that school have chosen to reject

24

the education which the state is required to offer.

25

school in this case was clearly discharging an

The

1

obligation of the Commonwealth, not only in the sense

2

that the Commonwealth was paying for the education and

3

had prescribed the educational program for the child,

but that the Commonwealth would have had to provide this

education itself.

QUESTION:

You say there is a great difference

11

between this situation and the situation that the Chief

12

Justice posed to you, but isn’t this state by statute

13

required to furnish an education for everybody?

14
15
16

MR. KAROL:

Yes, it is required to furnish an

education for everyone.

Well, how is that different from

this situation, other than the financing?
MR. KAROL*

Because the private school in that

case is providing education to children who have —

7

either they or their parents have chosen to reject the

8

public education which the state provides.

9

QUESTION*

Well, I know that.

That may be one

10

way of talking about it, but it nevertheless is

11

discharging the state obligation in both cases.

12

MR. KAROL;

13

QUESTION*

14

Well —
At least it is a substitute for a

state obligation.

That is correct.

The child is

Yes, and the state is relieved of

an obligation in both cases.
MR. KAROL*

Well, the state would still have

an obligation —

Or it is relieved of an obligation

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

HR, KAROLj

It is -- That is correct.

The

2

important point that we wish to emphasize is that when

3

the school provides education in this case to these

4

children, it is discharging an obligation of the state

5

and performing a sovereign function as an agent or

6

instrumentality of the Commonwealth.

7

agencies or state employees provide services in

8

discharge of the Commonwealth's obligation, they, of

9

course, must observe constitutional standards when they

10
11

When state

do so .
The question then in this case is whether a

12

different standard should apply when the state elects to

13

deliver those same services through a closely controlled

14

agent like the school, rather than through its own

15

full-time employees.

16

We maintain that the same standard must apply
i

17

in either case, because states should not have it within

18

their discretion to avoid constitutional obligations by

19

the simple expediency of farming out their statutory

20

obligations.

21

constitutional rights must not be permitted to turn upon

The existence or non-existence of

22 formal distinctions between agents who are on the state
23

payroll and those who aren't.

If states are permitted

24

to retain alter egos like the school to deliver

25

essential services, and if those alter egos are as free

10

to disregard constitutional rights as they — as the

2

state chooses to permit them to be, then citizens will

3

ultimately be dependent upon nothing more than the will

4

of the state for protection —

5

QUESTION;

Well, what — suppose a city has an

6

obligation to provide roads and streets and bridges and

7

things like that, which it does, and it contracts with a

8

construction firm to build a bridge, and it has — it

9

certainly has standards that they have to live up to.

10

They put out for bids, and they have the specifications,

11

and they agree to pay a certain amount of money.

12

finance the entire deal.

13

that independent contractor a state instrumentality for

14

purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment?

Not necessarily.

We would

distinguish cases in which the private entity is

17

performing a function on behalf of the state from

18

situations in which it is not, and we would distinguish

19

it on the basis of whether or not the private entity's

20

conduct substantially and materially affects the

21

delivery of the particular service, so that under this

functional analysis —

4

as the discharge in this case?

5

MB. KAROLi

Wouldn’t that have as

I don’t believe so.

I think the

6

distinction is that when a school fires teachers for

7

failing a professional duty to speak out on professional

8

matters, on educational matters affecting students, that

9

there is not only the immediate impact of losing those

10

particular teachers, but that all teachers at that

11

school then and in the future know that they risk

12

dismissal for expressing those types of professional

13

opinions and —

14

QUESTION!

MR. KAROL

I think what is more important

than the particular episode is whether a rule of law

that service.

the quality of the delivery of the service, and it

12

However, when that same maintenance company

makes decisions about who it is going to hire, or what

14

equipment it is going to buy, or who it is going to buy

15

equipment from, the impact on the quality of the service

16

is substantially less, and that is why I come back in

17

this case to the point that if teachers know that they

about the quality of education, then the quality of

QUESTION:

What if one of several supervisors

2

MS. KAROL*

I think that this is similar to

3

the question before about the bridge supervisor.

If

4

this person is simply an individual who is expressing

5

his own opinions, and is not in a position which confers

6

upon him the responsibility to express opinions about

type, then when he is discharged for expressing such

8

opinions, he is — the company discharging him is

9

exercising a private function.

He is performing a

10

private function because this particular individual's

11

speech is probably not any significantly more important

12

than any other individual's speech insofar as that

13

quality of service is concerned, and you do have to

14

separate the functions of the private entity which are

15

private from the functions of the private entity which

16

are public.

17

I think the state action requirement, the

18 primary purpose is to protect a zone of privacy, to
19 establish a zone of privacy, and it is a sensitive
20 balancing of interests which is involved here.

MR. KAROL*

3

QUESTION*

4

I think -But there isn't even that here, is

there?

5

MR. KAROL*

No.

What there is is an

6

abdication of responsibility, and I think that that is

7

akin to the situation you had in the so-called White

8

Primary cases, where the Democratic Party, particularly,

9

for example, in Terry versus Adams, was not retained by

10

the state to determine voter eligibility requirements in

11

general elections, but the state in effect abdicated

12

responsibility to the Party to permit it to determine

13

eligibility requirements in the only elections which

14

counted, namely, the Democrat:c pre-primaries, so that

15

in that case, the party was held subject to

16

constitutional obligations to the extent the state
/

17

permitted it to perform that function.
So that I think abdication of responsibility

18
19

or, as in this case, an express delegation of

20

responsibility is a substitute for the kind of

21

regulatory involvement that the Court has dealt with

22

from time to time, where the private entity is ordered

23

to do something.

24

case where a private entity has been ordered to do

25

something.

5

the same if this particular school had only one or two

9

In that case, I think we would

acknowledge that the school would be performing a dual

To the extent it is providing education to

those one or two students, certainly it is discharging a

public obligation, but it is also performing a private

17

I think that to the extent you can separate

dismissal for writing a letter to a local paper if that

4

would say that the likelihood is in that case that the

accommodation to the state than in order to provide for

Well, putting perhaps the same

question in a little different form, if the Wilmington

Parking case had not involved discrimination against a

patron, but rather had been firing an employee or

something, you would say that case would still equally

apply to a discharge of an employee?

Wilmington case is substantially different from this

18

case in the sense that in the Wilmington case, we are

19

talking about the closeness of the relationship between

20

the entity and the state, whereas here the major

argument of the Petitioners is that there has been a

delegation or a farming out, as Mr. Karol indicated, of

the function, and under that kind of analysis, the

Do you think that the court of

MR. FEINBERG*

I believe the court of appeals

indeed if a student was making a claim against a school,

24

the circumstances might be different for purposes of a

2

would be a very, very different question.

3

however, under a public function doctrine analysis

4

primarily, and I have assumed that the Petitioners have

5

largely conceded the nexus argument under Jackson and

6

the symbiosis argument under Burton for purposes of this

on the exclusivity aspect of this school’s functioning,

MR. FEINBERG;

And the first 100 years of that

HR. FEINBERGi

Certainly, Your Honor, in the

sense that since the 1860's public funds have been made

that the purpose of the school was not set up to take

Some of those children, Your

Some of them were
Some, if they could,

11

other than those who could afford to pursue a private

12

education.

13

QUESTIONi

Are the other schools in

14 Massachusetts identical to this particular school?
15

MR. FEINBERGj

Yes, Your Honor.

There is a

16 list at the back, of amicus's brief that would indicate a
t

17

wide variety of schools, some of which are well known

18 throughout the country, such as the Perkins School for
19

the Blind, that have been providing private education

20

for literally over 100 years in Massachusetts to

21

children such as the childern at New Perspectives

22 School.

The only difference between these schools is

23 the amount and degree of public referral.

2

fit base, indeed, the Petitioners' petition

3

comes down to just that, to the question of whether or

not this school falls within the state action rubrick of

5

the Fourteenth Amendment on the grounds of its

6

substantial public funding, and in that sense, I would

7

suggest to the Court that this school is no different

8

from any other state entitlement program, and in that

9

sense, the amount of funding is not a relevant

10

consideration here, given the nature of this entity.
For example, with regard to what we have in

11

MR. FEINBERG:

that to play that numbers game would be a very dangerous

QUESTION

2

(General laughter.)

3

MR. FEINBERGi

With that in mind.

The second — The realities of

4

dealing with a mixed school are that the party or the

5

child who comes to that school because it is the correct

6

school for that child perhaps or perhaps not

7

fortuitously, depending upon the percentage and the

8

cutoff point, has an entire school subject to state

9

action and the Fourteenth Amendment, and what I would

10

suggest to the Court are the considerable restraints

11

that would be imposed on a more freewheeling educational

12

policy at that school, and in that sense, certainly such

13

a result would impact adversely and unfairly upon the

14

private person who simply wants to obtain the best

15

placement for his child, his or her child.

16

I might also add, Your Honor, that to play

17

with percentages, all a school need do to avoid the

18

restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment would be to hold

19

open two or three or five or whatever number of places

20

would be necessary for a private referral in order to

21

avoid the Fourteenth Amendment, so that what we have in

22

dealing with that kind of problem is a situation in

23

which the Fourteenth Amendment is either on the one hand

24

easily circumvented, or on the other hand a system in

25

which the schools are fortuitously either in or out of

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

the Fourteenth Amendment, simply depending upon what

2

percentage this Court would impose upon the school as

3

one which triggers the Fourteenth Amendment.

4

The two other aspects of this case that I

5

think are important to bring forward are that in no

6

sense does this school perform a delegated function

7

under the public function doctrine.

8

delegation in the ordinary sense that that word is used,

9

for example, in the Flagg Brothers versus Brooks case,

There has been no

10

the election cases in Marsh versus Alabama.

In those

11

cases, there was either on the one hand a complete

12

abdication of the state’s functioning, or on the other

13

hand a total absence of the state, for example, in the

14 company town situation.
15
16

As I have already indicated. Chapter 766,
rather than abdicate responsibility, if it stands for
/

17 nothing else, it stands for an expansion of the state's
18 responsibility in the area of educating handicapped
19 children, and in that sense, it certainly did not

MR. FEINBERG:

In conclusion, Mr. Justice

policy, free from state interference.

15

Part of the purpose of Chapter 766 was to

18 important community problem, the need to upgrade the
19 educational opportunities of handicapped and disabled

The Fourteenth Amendment, it is submitted by
