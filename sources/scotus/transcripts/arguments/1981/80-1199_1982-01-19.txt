WICKHAM*

Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court, these cases were consolidated for trial

10 and

remain so.

The Patterson case is a class action case

brought by private litigants under Title 7 as well as under

1981, alleging race discrimination only.

703(h), which provides for intent.

22

If the Fourth Circuit is right, seniority systems

23 are no longer provided

with the special treatment that the

24 Congress very clearly gave them in enacting

703(h) of Title

25 7.

Upon moving for relief, the district court

12 summarily dismissed our contentions, holding that the

13 seniority system was not bona fide and on appeal of this
14 decision in Patterson Two a panel of the Fourth Circuit
15 remanded the case as to one aspect of the seniority system,
16 which was what we have called the no-transfer rule.

This

17 system did not permit a transfer from one branch or one
18 plant to the other branch or plant without a loss of
19 competitive seniority.
20
21

The panel of the Fourth Circuit held that that
aspect should be remanded to the district court for

22 determination under

703(h).

But it held on its own motion,

23 so to speak, that the lines of progression were not a
24 seniority system.
25

On rehearing en banc, the Fourth Circuit also

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

remanded a case concerning the no-transfer rule, hut it held

2

also for the first time that since the lines of progression

3 were established

or substantially revised in January of

4

1968, they were not covered by

703(h).

They went on to hold

5

that there was not sufficient evidence in the record to

6 determine the bona fides of the no-transfer
7

they did not have to reach the question of whether or not

8 the lines of progression were a

part of a seniority system.

We believe that the Fourth Circuit’s holding is

9
10 plainly

11

rule, and that

wrong, when we read the language of the statute and

the legislative history which all point to the fact that all

12 seniority systems are to be given special treatment,
13 memorandums
14

to the contrary, one being the Justice

Department memorandum and another the case memorandum, which

15 were both
16 whether
17 Title 7,

published to answer the specific question of

or not vested seniority rights would be denied under
and those two memorandums answered the question

18 presented and nothing more,
19 rights,

and said that existing seniority

of course, would not be affected.
All the other legislative history, including

20
21

two

statements by Senator Humphrey, Senator Williams, other

22 questions submitted
23 that

by Senator Dirksen all point to the fact

all seniority systems are to be included within the

24 cloak of

703(h).

25

To hold otherwise really does away with the special

treatment that this Court has said must be afforded to

2

seniority systems, because of our national labor policy

3 concerning collective bargaining, and of course seniority is

MR. WICKHAM*

Absolutely.

question of whether or not these systems should be

10 impact test of Griggs, and we say that

difference.

that is the big

That is what we are here for, and we say that

12 new systems do not lose that immunity.

Indeed, employers

13 and unions would be reluctant to change any system for fear
14 that they would lose the intent analysis of 703(h), and
15 therefore it does not further -- our labor policy of
16 collective bargaining.
17

The petitioner's interpretation seems to say that

18 in some instances a new system might be protected by 703(h),
19 but of course our system should not be protected, and the
20 bottom line seems to be that while our system shouldn't be
21

protected because it is a discriminatory system, and it

22 continues the present effects of past discrimination.

It

23 seems to me that Patterson and EEOC always come back to the
24 fact that we have got a bad

system, but that is not what is

25 before this Court.

I think that Teamsters and Evans and Hardison all

Again, to hold otherwise would be to take away the

treatment that has been afforded seniority systems.
In conclusion, I would like to state that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD ROSENBERG, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER UNIONS
MR. ROSENBERG;

17 the

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

Court, the issue in this case and the problem that this

18 Court must
19 existed

address is to reconstitute the values that

as the Congress decided this controversial and

20 critical piece of legislation in

1964, and the question is

21 how to apply the traditional mechanisms of

statutory

22 interpretation to this situation and to recreate
23 troubled

time in American history.

24

In

1964,

25 controversial.

1964, a

this bill was before the Congress.

The debates on it were protracted.

It was
The

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

alliances in support of the bill were under constant attack,

2 and

they were under particular attack in the area that this

3 Court must now address, and that is to what extent were the
4 beneficial provisions of Title 7 to deal with the difficult
5 questions of seniority that were repeatedly used as a method
6 for challenging the passage of

Title 7 by its opponents who

7 acted vigorously indeed.
And thus, the proponents of the bill, considering

8

9 the charge that this bill would attack seniority, that this
10 bill would
11

affect seniority rights, were called upon

repeatedly to lay to rest what they considered to be a

12 canard,

that the bill would affect seniority rights.

And

13 ultimately, as that debate continued, not only did the
14 various proponents of the bill speak broadly and without
15 qualification that the bill would not affect seniority
16 rights at all, ultimately they found it necessary in order
17 to obtain final passage of this critical bill to add to the
18 statute Section 703(h), which confirmed as a part of the
19 actual statute rather than its legislative history the
20 acknowledgement that they had made that seniority,
21

the

seniority principle was a preferred value that was to be

22 maintained

so long as seniority was not used as a

23 subterfuge, compressed within the phrase, the provision that
24 ultimately became 703(h), the phrase "bona fide" and the
25 provision that there is to be -- seniority systems would be

demonstration of intentional discrimination.

3 had.
4

The Congress

compressed in 703(h) its strong desire to deal with

these conflicting policies,

5 the alliance that

policy that could have separated

had created Title 7.

And so, against that legislative context, we must

6
7 look

to the development of this statute as it worked its way

8 through.

As Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, and as Mr.

9 Wickham responded,

the impact of the decision here in our

10

favor would mean that we would go through a determination as

11

to whether or not the seniority systems here involved were

12 in

fact bona fide or the product of intention to

13 discriminate.

A reversal of the court of appeals would not

14 end

this case.

It would merely give us the opportunity on

15 the

remand to show what we have consistently maintained,

16 that these systems are indeed bona fide.
17

But let us look for the moment to the legislative

18 history as it developed

through the Congress in

19 looking at that legislative history from

1964,

the view of the

20 proponents.
21

QUESTION:

Mr.

Rosenberg, could I interrupt with

22 one question before you get into the legislative history?
23

MR. ROSEN BEPG:

24

QUESTION;

25 system,

Yes.

With respect to a pre-Act seniority

it is safe to assume that it would have had impact

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that might have raised Title 7 problems if you didn't apply

2

an intent test, so that you can understand why an impact

3 test would not be sufficient for a pre-Act system.

When you

4 look at a post-Act system, one that is brand-new, I wonder
5 if there is really that much difference between an intent
6 test and

an impact test, because isn’t it almost necessary

7 that when the system is designed, the people are going to
8 predict how

it will operate, and aren’t they going to know

9 whether or not it is going to have an adverse impact?
10
11

In this case, for example, wouldn't you know what
the probable consequences of this line of progression would

12 do and what

13

it would not do?

MR.

ROSENBERG:

Yes, there might well be -- there

14 might be well the impact, but we would not, Your Honor,

be

15 adopting —
16

QUESTION:

Well, if you know what the consequences

17 are, then doesn't that satisfy the intent requirement?
ROSENBERG:

No, because the seniority principle

19 is a broader principle.

We might well be operating in order

18

MR.

20 to enhance
21

the seniority principle.

Our intent might be a

bona fide intent, an intent not to discriminate.

of the situation, there could be

23 situations where by reason of technological change or the
24 like, there is a need to adopt what could be referred to as
25 a new system.

post-Act systems, our conduct would be judged under 703 (h)

2

and the discriminatory standard, so that the EEOC has said

3

at least as far as implementation, which is the far more

4

predominant instance where charges could be made, post-Act

5

systems are entitled to protection under 703(h), and in

6

doing so they are taking a position contradictory to the

court of appeals, and to the position advanced by the

8

private respondents.

QUESTION;

And to their former position.

MR. ROSENBERG;

And to their former position.

Very

11

important, Your Honor, that the reading that they now

advance is advanced for the first time between the time of

supported by the statutory language, a reading that is not

at war with the essence of 703(h), which is intended to

apply and makes clear to bona fide systems, seniority

18 matter how much seniority an employee had, he had to have
19 served in a bottom job in order to get to the top job, and
20

because the bottom jobs in the most desirable lines of

progression had been deliberately reserved for whites over

22

the years, the decision to adopt the lines of progression

23 operated to freeze the status quo of the prior

The three documents introduced into the

In fact, it makes this

"Its effect is prospective and not

Now,

Senators Clark and Case were the bipartisan

6 after very careful

study, the entire court seemed to agree

7 that the thrust of 703(h)

was the validation of seniority

8 systems in existence on the effective date of the

Act.

It certainly appears that Congress did not intend

10

to immunize post-Act seniority systems, and even if it did,

11

it was not the intent of Congress in passing 703(h) to

12 protect a

system like this, a post-Act system which

13 perpetuated the effects of prior intentional discrimination
14 by the very company and union which were involved in
15 perpetuating that discrimination.
Now, on this business about the national policy of

16

17 collective bargaining, there are circumstances where there
18 may be a conflict between the national policy supporting
19 collective bargaining and the Congressional priority to
20 eliminate discrimination.
21

When those situations exist, this

Court has said that the resolution depends on the facts

22 involved,

but that conflict cannot exist in this case, where

23 the industry involved, the company, and the union involved
24 have a long history of actively operating and maintaining a

be read to immunize the decision to adopt an

6 aspect of the seniority system.

MR. STRAUSS;

We did not raise the ground below.

As I say, this entire issue was not addressed below, but as

3

respondents, we are offering it as an alternative ground for

affirmance.

8
9

MR. STRAUSS;

There are several cases establishing

that that can be raised, Dandridge and Williams, North

11

Well, I know there are a lot of cases

12

where we -- you can affirm on a ground that wasn't decided

13

below, but do you have a case specifically where the ground

14

used was never raised or presented to anybody below?

15

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, this is an instance in which

16

the court of appeals -- no party addressed the issue on

17

which the court of appeals decided the case.

18

QUESTION;

Do you know of a case in this Court

19

where we affirmed on a ground that was never raised in any

20

of the courts below by any of the parties?

21

MR. STRAUSS;

I don’t know one offhand, but when

22

the court of appeals addresses an issue that was never --

23

decides the case on the basis of an issue that was never

addressed, necessarily the Court must deal with that issue.

the ground you are presenting now.
MR. STRAUSS;

2

Well, it is certainly comprised in

3 the court of appeals decision.

It is not a wholly separate

4 and distinct ground from the court of appeals, ground on
5 which the court of appeals decided the case.

6

Well, I don't quite understand that.

7 Your position is that adoption is simply not pursuant to and

MR. STRAUSS;

MR. STRAUSS;

15 that Section 703(h)

Well, the court of appeals also said

It cast its net wider, and assumed that

17 even if applications as well as adoptions were legitimately

that its rule would apply.

17

There are a couple of points that petitioners raise

18 in opposition to this argument.

One is that it would

19 somehow be meaningless to draw this distinction, because the
20 remedy for an unlawful
21

adoption of the seniority system

would necessarily affect the application.

22 variety of answers to this.

There are a

The most straightforward answer

23 is the one the Court gave in Franks against Bowman, which is
24 that the fact that a remedy might affect seniority rights is
25 immaterial to Section 703(h).

Section 703(h) is simply not

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

addressed to remedial adjustments of seniority rights.

2

In addition, as we say in our brief, under the

3 National Labor Relations Act, which was the model for much
4 of Title 7,

this distinction between adoption and

5 application of unlawful features of collective bargaining
6 agreements is established.

Justice Harlan, when he wrote

7 that opinion, Machinists Local 1424, saw no difficulty with
8 outlawing the adoption of a collective bargaining agreement,

9 although not its application, even though obviously the
10 remedy would

have to run to application as well.

Finally, I think what is at stake here is that

11

12 the —

13

QUESTION;

Mr. Strauss, may I ask you a question to

14 be sure I understand the thrust of your argument?

Are you

15 in essence arguing that the adoption of a new seniority
16 system or a

new aspect of a seniority system should be

17 judged by the same standard as the adoption of any other
18 employment practice after the Act?
19

MR. STRAUSS;

20

QUESTION;

21

That’s right.

That's exactly right.

That there’s nothing in the history of

the Act that says adoption of these kinds of rules are

22 different from the adoption of any other kind of rule?

23

MR. STRAUSS;

24

QUESTION;

That’s exactly right.

And then it follows under your argument

25 -- I just want to be sure I am stating it right -- that if

6

MR. STRAUSS;

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. STRAUSS:

No, it would not.

Why not?
The adoption of a seniority system is

9 to be judged, as you say, in the same way as, say, a

a job.

I understand that.

MR. ROSENBERG;

Crucial to the EEOC's position is

12 the repeated statement that my opponent made that the

14 always seniority rights.

That is clearly incorrect.

15 Senator Clark, one of the proponents of the bill, in
16 introducing the very memorandum that constitutes the whole
17 of the legislative history advanced by respondent, stated
18 that seniority — it is clear that the bill would not affect
19 seniority at all.

9

MR.

ROSENBERG;

I submit. Your Honor, that the

10 statement is not isolated.
11

There were many such statements

by the sponsors intending to lay to rest the charge that

12 seniority would be adversely affected by

the statute.

As I

13 started to say, Senator Humphrey also -14

QUESTION;

May I ask one other question?

Is there

15 anything in the legislative history to suggest that Congress
16 intended that the adoption of subsequent seniority plans
17 should be judged by any different standard than the adoption
18 of other eligibility rules or work practices, whatever it
19 might be?
MR. ROSENBERG;

20
21

Yes, the repeated Congressional

concerns that seniority not be affected, and the adoption

22 itself of

703(h) as a method of assuring that the repeated

23 statements by the proponents regarding the sanctity of the
24 seniority principle would be preserved.

Indeed, when 703(h)

MR. ROSENBERG:

Except -- to the extent that they

7 are bona fide, and 703(h) leaves, as Justice Rehnquist
8 points out,

and as Justice Stevens' questions point out, and

9 a determination as to the bona fide nature.

Congress stated

10

broadly, unqualifiedly, and repeatedly, they always were

11

doing so in the context of a system that was bona fide, and

12

703(h) crystallized those views in an attempt to deal with

13 the -14

QUESTION:

Without regard to when the seniority

15 system was adopted, pre or post-Act.
16

MR. ROSENBERG:

That's correct.

There is not a

17 word to indicate any distinction between when the seniority
18 system was adopted, and certainly not a word to deal with
19 the difference between adoption and implementation.
20 essence of the EEOC position is
21

The

that a post-Act system,

the

implementations of that post-Act system are protected under

22 703(h),

so that 703(h) has application to post-Act systems,

23 and that is why it is so fundamentally at war with what the
24 court of appeals held.
