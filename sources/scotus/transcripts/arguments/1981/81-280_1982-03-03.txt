MR. MC ALEESE;

Court;
In this case the courts below stretched the

17

reach of the contract portion of Section 1981 of Title

18

42 to impose liability for racial discrimination on a

19

private business organization and three private trade

20

associations who themselves did not practice

21

discrimination, did not have any intent to discriminate,

22

did not conspire to discriminate, and neither knew nor

23

had reason to know that the discrimination for which

24

they were held liable was being practiced.

25

general question presented hereby is whether Section

1981 does indeed reach so far
The case began in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania

3

in 1971 when 12 blacks in the Commonwealth of

4

Pennsylvania sued, among others, a construction union, a

5

construction contractor, and three contractor

6

associations for racial discrimination under, among

7

other statutes, Section 1981.

8

complaint was the union's exclusive referral system

both the Plaintiff and the Defendant's sides,tThe

13

construction contractor, Glasgow, being the class

14

representative for approximately 1500 other contractors,

15

and the associations being the class representatives for

16

other associations.
This afternoon I will argue on behalf of

18

Glasgow, and Mr. Kester on behalf of the associations.
The case was bifurcated for trial into a

liability phase and a damage phase.

21

completed.

22

The former has been

The latter essentially has not started.
Following trial, the trial court imposed

23

liability under Section 1981 on the union, on Glasgow,

24

and on the three associations, and thus on the members

25

of the defendant classes that these defendants

represented.

It issued an extensive injunction against

2

all defendants ani class members, which included hiring

quotas and training programs.
Stated in a somewhat simplified fashion, the

trial court's decision under Section 1981 respecting

6

Glasgow was that the union, defendant union

7

intentionally discriminated against minorities in the

8

operation of its referral system, and solely because

10

notified the union of its need for workmen, and

11

thereafter hired persons referred by the union, it, too,

12

was enveloped within the Section 1981 net.

13

I might again add that the trial court found

14

-- and those findings are unchallenged -- that Glasgow

15

itself did not discriminate, did not intend to

16

discriminate, did not conspire to discriminate, and

17

neither knew nor had reason to know that the union was

law, the union, with impunity, struck Glasgow and the

3

other employers to force their agreement to the union's

referral system.
After a ten week strike which the trial court

5
6

called destructive, Glasgow and the others capitulated

7

to the union and thereupon agreed to notify the union of

8

the need for workmen so that referrals could be made by

9

the union to them.
In 1963 an attempt was made by Glasgow and

10
11

other contractors to rid themselves of the referral

12

provision but a strike, another strike, lengthy strike

13

rendered this unsuccessful.

Throughout the entire period covered by this

case, the registration, the grouping within this

exclusively by employees of the union.

As contractually and indeed legally obligated

1

2

to do, Glasgow used the system by notifying the union of

3

its need and then hiring referrals therefrom.
The District Court specifically determined

4
5

that the employees of the union who, without the

6

knowledge or any reason to know by Glasgow that these

7

employees who registered, grouped, aligned and referred

8

engineers, failed to do so in accordance with the rules

9

governing the system.

In the words of the trial court,

10

the union procedures in general constituteds a motley

11

fabric of arbitrary departure from the rules.
Instead, and in breach of the collective

12

13

bargaining agreement with Glasgow, those employees of

14

the union registered, grouped, aligned and/or referred

15

engineers in an intentionally racially discriminatory

16

fashion.

QUESTION:

Why do you say it was a breach of

the collective bargaining agreement?
MR. MC ALEESE:

The collective bargaining

20

agreement. Justice Rehnquist, contains an outline of how

21

the system is constructed, the union's referral system,

22

and specifies, as it were, the rules for the running of

23

that system, and when the union, instead of complying

24

with those rules, but instead engaging in this conduct,

25

as it were, outside the agreement, engaged in a breach

9

of the agreement.
QUESTION;

2

It was not only outside of the

3

agreement; it was contrary to the agreement's provisions

4

then.

MR. MC ALEESE:

6

breach of the agreement.
2UESTI0N:

7

Contrary.

It was a direct

Well, did the agreement, you mean,

8

have an express provision that in the operation of the

9

hiring hall there should be no discrimination on account

10

of race?

MR. MC ALEESE:

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. MC ALEESE;

14

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

In terms.
It did commencing in 1971.

That was incorporated into the agreement.
QUESTION:

15

Counsel, I suppose respondents rely

16

in part on a theory that 1981 imposes a non-delegable

17

duty on the employers, and secondly, that the employers

18

had an obligation to enforce the terms of the collective

19

bargaining agreement as to hiring in a nondiscriminatory

20

fashion.

21

Would you address those theories?

22

MR. MC ALEESE;

23

With respect to the second question that you

Yes, Justice O’Connor.

24

asked, treating that first, they do intend — indeed

25

contend that we had an obligation to enforce, but keep

in mind that there are unchallenged findings that

2

Glasgow, and indeed, other contractors, neither knew nor

3

had reason to know that the union was practicing

4

discrimination, was, as Justice Rehnquist said, its

5

conduct was contrary to the agreement.

6

Now, with respect to your first question,

7

there is a contention indeed that 1981 imposes a

8

non-delegable duty.

9

approached analytically in two ways.

I think that question can be
I think first,

10

going directly to the issue, does it contain a

11

non-delegable duty,

12

the construction of Section 1981.

13

duty spoken of by the trial court in its lengthy opinion

14

was a duty stemming from 1981 imposed on Glasgow under

15

these circumstances to prevent the discrimination being

16

practiced by the union.

As a matter of fact, Justice White --

QUESTION*

Well, though, is that to suggest

that if we were to hold that there was a non-delegable

duty under 1981, that is still not the end of the case?

non-delegable duty.

11

QUESTION*

12

MR. MC ALEESE*

13

wouldn't. Justice White.

14

that is that if the non-delegable duty is duty to

15

prevent discrimination, as the trial court said in its

16

opinion, then it seems that if you were to rule in this

17

case that intent is a part of 1981, that there would

18

have to be proof that the failure, the failure to

19

prevent discrimination was itself racially motivated.

Well, that isn't what he said.
No, it wouldn't, no, it

to, in connection with the matter of the non-delegable

duty, you can approach this case the other way.

3

QUESTIONi

Certainly.

4

MR. MC ALEESE:

Looking at an interpretation

5

of the statute, not unlike Justice Stevens did in the

6

case last term, the City of Memphis v. Green where you

7

can analyze the specific conduct that is challenged

8

here.

9

And what is that conduct?
The conduct by Glasgow that has been -- that

10

liability was based upon is that Glasgow, pursuant to a

11

contractual obligation it had, notified the union of its

12

need for workmen and then considered and indeed did

13

employ the persons referred by the union.

14

challenged conduct.

15

That is the

Now the question is, looking at 1981, the

16

language of the statute and its legislative history, is

17

that the kind of conduct which is violative of 1981?

18

That is another way to analyze the matter of what are

19

the duties stemming from 1981, and that is to say that

20

whatever the duties are that 1981 imposes, duties

21

separate and apart from the question of whether or not

22

there is need for a discriminatory motive, that whatever

23

they are, this challenged conduct did not fall within

24

the ambit of coverage of Section 1981.

25

If another defendant was, then his

NR. NC AIEESE;

10

I think that the notion of

11

non-delegable duty is the sense that there are some

12

activities beyond the physical conduct engaged in by the

13

defendant which liability is imposed on the defendant

14

for that conduct, and the reason why it is is not on any

15

vicarious theory but instead that the defendant owes a

16

direct duty to the plaintiff, and it would seem that

17

using the non-delegable duty type theory in the context

18

of 1981 that this Court would have to interpret,

19

construe Section 1981 as imposing an obligation on

20

Glasgow under these circumstances to prevent the

21

discrimination which was practiced by the union

employees.

it can be approached in one of two ways.

action against a single employer, let's take for example

QUESTION:

18

How is it another way?

MR. MC ALEESE:

Well, of course, in this

20

particular case, following 18 months of trial and

21

evidence on these various questions, the trial court

22

found that there was not only no knowledge, but indeed,

23

also no reason to know, which is I think the area that

24

you are suggesting.

25

QUESTION:

This was a hypothetical.

It wasn’t

3

ME. MC ALEESEi

Just briefly# in closing here,

4

it is our position that we suggest to this Court that it

5

rule that intent is necessary for a violation of Section

6

1981# and the very brief basis of that is the close

7

relationship between Section 1981 and the 14th Amendment

8

and its requirements as this Court has spelled out in

9

the case of Washington v. Davis.

With respect to the

10

decision by the lower court, going away specifically

11

from what we might call a direct violation of Section

12

1981 and going to the matter of respondeat superior, I

13

think that is very, very easily disposed of.

14

certainly is a substantial question as to whether

15

respondeat superior can be used with 1981, and even if

16

so, what the extent of that would be because of the

17

personalized nature o the statute, 1981.

18

There

But beyond that, it doesn't seem in this case

19

that a decision has to be made on that simply because it

20

is so clear that there was no right to control, right to

21

supervise the union employees who practiced the

22

discrimination in this case.

23

QUESTION*

Well, you had the — I don't quite

24

understand that.

You had the — you had a contratual

right to prevent the union from racially discriminating.

This case comes before the Court with a very

sharp and very clear legal issue, and that issue is not

whether the victims of racial discrimination may recover

under 1981 against the discriminator.

20

the Court is how far that liability under Section 1981

21

is to be extended.

22

whether 1981 reaches private action, but whether it also

23

extends to reach private inaction, and the issue is very

nothing more than negotiate the collective bargaining

11

that even though they had no knowledge and notice of the

they weren't employers, because not one operating

that you two have framed essentially two alternative

Now, if you believe that Section 1981 requires

one could even argue that that was decided in Washington

was involved in Washington v. Davis, but 1981 certainly

The JATC, Joint Apprenticeship

and Training Program, right.
QUESTION;

9

Do the associations have anything

10

to do with that by way of appointing the trustees or

11

anything ?
MR. KESTER;

12

The Joint Apprenticeship and

13

Training Program has six trustees, and three of those

14

are from the associations and three of them are from the

15

union.

16

They come from that source, but they are — the JATC is

17

a totally separate entity.

18

district court's opinion that ever suggested that

liability could be rested on the associations because

20

they appointed three of the members of the JATC.

And Title 7 has a very carefully thought out

Jones against Myers Company was decided four yeas

Now, 1981, which dates back to 1866 and 1870,

7

is a law guaranteeing equal rights generally, an equal

8

right to testify, to enter contracts, equal punishments,

9

taxes, and licenses, and if there is in its legislative

10

history, which goes on for hundreds of pages, there’s

11

not one hint of a kind of vicarious liability such as

12

proposed in this case.

13

If this case involves an exception, if you

14

would regard this as some kind of a loophole in civil

15

rights liability, I’d have to say any requirement of

16

intent, then, would be a loophole, and yet this Court

17

habitually requires intent in all of these statutes.

rather extravagant position that anyone who is in any

any strike since 1963, some 18 years ago, and certainly

Well, isn’t it just a system of job

referral that’s operated by the union?
MR. GOODMAN:

It is a system of job referral,

15

but it’s also a system of entry because the only way you

16

can enter the union is if the union made the decision to

17

admit people, and the employers, Justice Rehnquist, are

18

the ones who gave the union that right.

19

could have chosen to use a foreman or their own

20

personnel office, but they did choose and continued to

21

do so over the last 20 years to rely on this particular

22

unit, and here are the consequences of that.

that 1500 employers relied on Local 542, not on their

that were that hundreds of minorities, solely because of

their race, were denied jobs with the employers and were

precluded from earning a living.

MR. GOODMAN:

Preliminarily, Justice Powell,

on the issue, on the issue of vicarious liability, I

6

think it's important to point out that Judge

7

Higginbotham, I think consistent with the Court's

8

decision in Teamsters, bifurcated this case, and the

9

trial took a year and a half to complete.

So at stage

11

to injunctive relief.

individualized findings against Glasgow.

13

any individualized findings in favor of, against or in

14

favor of any individual member of the plaintiff class.

15

What he found was that most if not all of the employers

16

did know about the discrimination, but as a class,

17

viewed only as a class, they did not.

18

He did not make any
He didn't make

He then concluded that 1981 does in fact have

19

a vicarious liability component.

20

on essentially two theories, one, the non-delegable

21

duty, and two, essentially one of agency or joint

22

enterprise.

23

In doing that he drew

Now, with respect to the first, the

24

non-delegable duty, it is clear, and it is here

25

undisputed, that 1981 was violated, and it was violated

12

No.

Justice Rehnguist, that the union engaged in intentional

racial discrimination.

discrimination.

can that

to find vicarious liability because he couldn't find

that the employers were violating it themselves.
MR. GOODMAN:

11

As a — yes, sir.

That he had to impute somebody

else's liability to them.
MR. GOODMAN*

12

That's correct.

He did do

13

that.

My point in response to Justice Rehnquist's

14

question was that it is undisputed that minorities as a

15

class did not have the same right to make and enforce

16

contracts with the employers as did whites, and the

17

result of that was a substantial loss of work and a

18

substantial loss of wages.
QUESTION*

19

But that's a different thing than

20

saying it's undisputed that the employers violated 1581,

21

which is the way you put it a moment ago.
MR. GOODMAN:

22

What I meant — that is

23

correct.

What I meant was in that respect, that the

24

finding in that respect was vicarious, and it's to that

25

point that I would like to address myself now.

how long it would have lasted in addition to the year

8

I was saying earlier that Judge Higginbothem

9

concluded that there were critically important reasons

10

why the employers were necessary to the injunctive

relief, and I'd like to touch on those now.
QUESTIONS

12

Well, just on this.

I’m not sure

13

that I understand all of your position.

14

for the moment we disagreed with the District Court and

15

with you with respect to non-delegable duty, intent, and

16

that we just held that the employer — let's say we said

17

1981 requires an intentional discrimination, the

18

employers had no intentional discrimination, therefore

19

they're not liable under 1981.
Could you still reach them as part of the

remedy?

22

MR. GOODMAN;

23

QUESTION;

Yes, sir, even under the —

You have a completely independent

24

ground for saying the injunctive part of the decision

25

below would nevertheless run against the employers, even

1

if they weren't liable for back pay?
ME. GOODMAN;

2

Yes, sir, that's absolutely

3

correct.

Let me say first, though, on the issue of

4

intent, before I directly address that question, that

5

the intentional discrimination here that we are trying

6

to assess against the employers and the associations is

7

inputing it.

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. GOODMAN;

10
11

I understand.

I understand that.

And we think the cases support

that clearly.
But going beyond that, the answer to your

question is yes, there are independent grounds.

also premised —

QUESTION;

No, it was not.

It was not the

So wouldn't we have to remand

20

before we could ever -- wouldn't we have to have the

21

District Court do his remedy over if we didn't agree

22

with his theory of liability?

23
24
25

MR. GOODMAN;

The Court might do that.

I

don't think it in this instance would be compelled to.
But let me say that, beyond the All Writs Act,

57

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

as a matter of the broad discretion vested in the

2

District Court to correct intentional discrimination.

3

Judge Higginbothem had the power and exercised it,

4

Justice White, apart from the All Writs Act, to include

5

the employers.
Now, as a preface, just last week in Zipes

6
7

versus Trans-World Airlines, this Court over objections

8

by a union who had not been found guilty of any

9

violation of Title VII or 1981 held that it should be

10

included in the remedy for reasons of making whole the

11

victims of discrimination, regardless of their alleged

12

nonculpability.

13

opinion and focused upon those precise arguments, and

14

you called them meritless.

Justice White, you authored that

15

In this particular instance, the employers

16

were critically necessary for the following reasons;

17

The first is self-evident;

18

provided the work.

19

the wages.

20

minorities could get a nondiscriminatory share of the

21

24

be reached.

So that's the first reason

The second reason, and the critical reason, is

2
3

that the District Court was in this instance more than

4

just familiar with the history of the Philadelphia plan

5

and the history of discrimination in this industry.

6

knew, as the Federal Government knew, that a

7

Philadelphia type plan remedy was absolutely necessary,

8

or else equal employment opportunity could never be

9

achieved.

10

QUESTION;

He

Well, given the District Court's

11

finding that there was no intent on the part of the

12

contractors and no reason to know, on your theory that

13

they could be held in the case by reason of the

14

necessity for formulating a remedy, would it be proper

15

to assess the costs of the remedy in part against the

16

contractors ?

17

MR. GOODMAN;

I think it was within the

18

discretion of the District Court, in order to implement

19

the injunctive relief in this case.

20

another way, the question is can the District Court as

21

an exercise of its discretion assess remedial, as

22

opposed to damage or back pay, relief against parties

23

whom it found to be critically necessary to achieving

24

the injunctive relief we achieved here?

25

I think, phrased

And I think the answer is that the District

59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Court did have the discretion to do so and just as in

2

Kuran, for example, in the Eleventh Amendment case,

3

where the state could not be sued in damages because of

4

the bar of the Eleventh Amendment, this Court has held,

5

despite that bar. District Courts have the discretion to

6

award costs against the state.
QUESTION*

7

Do you think the District Court

8

would have exercised its discretion in this manner had

9

it decided that 1981 required intent and that its theory

10

of vicarious liability or non-delegable duty was wrong?
MR. GOODMAN*

11

I’s hard to speculate in respect

12

to that, Your Honor.

13

Bechtel, who succeeded Judge Higginbothem in the case,

14

in large measure assessed the 10 percent liability

15

against General Building Contractors Association because

16

of the factual finding that they recklessly disregarded

17

the rights to equal employment opportunity of my

18

clients.

19

of Judge Higginbothem.

20
21

22

But I would say this, that Judge

So that was triggered into a factual finding

But again, it is hard to speculate.

But I do

not believe it would have been an abuse of discretion.
QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Goodman, I didn’t know

23

that you could just — say you brought a suit against

24

your employer and say, you have not been hiring

25

minorities in suitable numbers.

And the employer says,

60

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

well, I guess that's right; and the judge says, yeah,

2

that's right, so I'm going to order you to hire them.

3

And the employer says, well, don't you have to find I've

4

violated the Act first?

5

guess not, no; I'm just going to order you to hire

6

them .

7
8
9

Don't you have to have — isn't a predicate
for this kind of relief some violation of a statute?
MF . GOODMAN;

I think that in answer to

10

Justice Rehnquist's question, which was assume that

11

there was no violation, could a District Court exercise

12

its discretion or did it have the power to exercise its

13

discretion to assess portions of remedial costs against

14

a non-wrongdoer —

15

QUESTION;

I'm talking about the remedy.

How

16

can you order the employer to restructure his work force

17

by hiring quotas without finding some violation of the

18

Act by the employer, not somebody else?

19

\

And the judge says, well, T

MR. GOODMAN;

Well, of course we believe very

20

strongly that Judge Higginbothem correctly found

21

vicarious liability against the employers.

22

QUESTION;

Yes.

23

MR. GOODMAN;

So the Court doesn't have to

24

reach that question.

However, if the Court reaches that

25

separate question, just as Zipes last week held that a

other than wrongdoer status, was being compelled to

7

exercised it.

*

As a matter of fact, it has been obscured but

9

And I think he correctly

ought to be pointed out here that in this particular

10

case the employers themselves suggested the very remedy

11

which Judge Higginbothem imposed.

12

the end that the duty not to discriminate, the duty to

13

comply with Section 1981, was on them.

14

the District Court to set goals in order to provide

15

nondiscrimination, and they said, we should be permitted

16

to hire outside of the union if we have to in order —

17

and I quote them — ”to ensure equal employment

opportunity."
QUESTIONS

Do you suppose they were influenced

20

in that request by the fact that that relieved them of

permitted them to overcome any opposition they had from

the union.

have done that, and that request for relief very well

might have done that, that's correct.

7

after the liability opinion was filed GBCA and CAEP

8

As a matter; of

so in answer to Justice White's question, the

9
10

Associations not only do have the power to file

11

grievances, but in this instance exercised it to seek an

12

arbitration award that relieved them of any

13

responsibility for Local 542.

14

arbitrator gave them that.

They secured that.

The

But Judge Higginbothem found that that order

15
16

would have denied minorities the equitable relief

17

against the employers that they were entitled to, and

18

for that reason denied it, denied the motion to uphold

19

that arbitration award.

20

But I think as well, Chief Justice Burger, the

21

notion that Local 542 held a pistol to the heads of 1500

22

companies and associations and compelled it to rely on

23

it and compelled it to engage in collective racial

24

discrimination that was intentional, misstates the facts

25

here.

Again, Your Honor, for the last

18 years there’s
