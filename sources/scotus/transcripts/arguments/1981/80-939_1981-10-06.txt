PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj

We will hear arguments next

3

in Federal Election Commission against the Democratic

4

Senatorial Campaign Committee and the consolidated case.

5

Mr. Steele, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES N. STEELE, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, FEC

8
9

MR. STEELE*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case involves the expenditures provided in

10

the Federal Election Campaign Act for political party

11

committees made in connection with the general election

12 campaigns of
13

candidates of that political party.

The amount awarded by the statute, allotted by the

14

statute, is two cents per voter; technically, two cents per

15

voter age population, which is the amount that the statute

16

sets for the expenditures.

17

The case arose before the Federal Election

18

Commission on a complaint filed by the Democratic Senatorial

19

Campaign Committee.

That complaint challenged the practice

20 of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and
21 the state party committees of the

22 they agreed

Republican Party, in which

that the state party committee's allocation

23

under the statute would be expended by the National

24

Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Steele, only on behalf of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 candidate in that state?

2

HR. STEELE:

8 the

think the statutory history will show.

QUESTION»

5 provision,

Yes, and the statute makes that very

I see.

That differs from the transfer

doesn't it?
MR. STEELE»

The transfer of authority in this

was from the state parties in the individual states of
spending limit of two cents per voter that they would

9 otherwise have for

the candidates for the Senate in their

10 state.
11

QUESTION»

In that state.

12

MR. STEELE»

13

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee

In that state, yes.

14 sought the Commission's reversal of an earlier decision for
15 a similar practice in

1978.

16 explicitly asked that that

Complaint before the Commission
decision be overruled; that the

17 Commission seek injunctions and civil penalties against
18 practice of

the

the National Republican Senatorial Campaign

19 Committee.
20
21 believe

The Commission on July 11, 1980 found no reason to
that that allegation stated a violation of the act

22 and refused

to take action on the complaint.

The Democratic

23 Senatorial Campaign Committee sought review as the statute
24 provides

in the District Court for the District of Columbia

25 under the statutory

provision 437g(a)(8), which provides
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that the District Court may review the Commission’s action
2 on a complaint and determine whether it was contrary to lav.
3

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee

4 appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals;

the Court of

5 Appeals reversed the decision of the District Court, finding
6 that the statute’s manifest purpose banned the practice of
7 these agreements, found that the basis on which the
8 Commission in earlier decisions had established this rule
9 presented a shifting basis, gave no deference to the
10 Commission’s interpretation of the statute and ordered that
11 the Commission proceed forthwith under the enforcement
12 responsibilities in the statute, which DSCC had invoked by
13 its complaint.
14

Those enforcement responsibilities are set forth

15 in our brief and I don’t intend to go through them in great
16 detail.

They provide for complaints filed, notice to the

17 opposite parties.

If the Commission finds reason to

18 believe, investigation, conciliation and eventual results
19 would be that the Commission would find probable cause to
20 believe.
21

QUESTION;

Hr. Steele, when you said that the

22 Court of Appeals found that the Commission had shifted its
23 position, would that be roughly analogous to the NLRB?
24

HR. STEELE;

I think that is analogous to the NLRB

25 and other administrative law cases I think was the analogy

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that they were drawing on.

We would submit that it is

2 different here in that what the Commission is doing is
3 exercising a prosecutorial authority rather than an
4 adjudicatory authority such as the National Labor Relations
5 Board Act.
6

QUESTION:

Hasn't this Court recognized the fact

7 that the NLR3 may, from time to time, shift its position,
8 and either one may be right?
9

MR. STEELE;

It certainly has, and I think, the

10 cases that we've cited reflect that.

The Commission would

11 submit that there was no shifting basis in its approach to
12 these; that indeed, the very fact that the DSCC sought
13 reversal of the decision in MUR 780, as it is noted in the
14 Commission's records, is evidence of the fact that the
15 Commission came to the’ same results in earlier cases.

But I

16 do think that in the cases that you cite, that even if there
17 had been a shift, that that would still be within the
18 discretionary authority of the Commission if it was
19 rationalized and so forth and so on.
20

But I do think this Court has recognized that —

21 the ability of an administrative agency to re-examine its
22 position should not be foreclosed.
23

The case raises issues both procedural and

24 substantive in this case.

Substantively, the question,

25 which I will address in a moment, is whether the Commission
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 was correct in its interpretation of the statute.

I would

2 like for a moment/ however/ to touch upon the procedural
3 issue because I think the two are intertwined in such a way
4 as to demonstrate the problem that the Commission has in the
5 procedural aspects with the decision of the court below.
6

The central issue in the case, in a sense, is

7 whether the statute so clearly prohibits the sort of
8 agreement that was entered into here; that it was
9 unwarranted for the FEC not to prosecute the case, not to go
10 forward under the provisions that it has for seeking
11 enforcement of the act.
12

The Court of Appeals stated that in its opinion,

13 it was not a discretionary exercise of Commission power that
14 was at issue here, but solely the interpretation of a
15 statute.

And it is precisely on that point that the

16 Commission thinks that the court below erred; erred in
17 relationship to other cases that it has decided with regard
18 to the Federal Election Campaign Act in the Commission's
19 exercise of its enforcement responsibilities, and erred more
20 broadly in the overall context of administrative law.
21

Indeed, as we have submitted in our brief, it

22 would seem that the exercise of the prosecutorial power, the
23 power to enforce the statute, is one that throughout the
24 jurisprudence of this country has been seen as a
25 discretionary one.

What you have here is the decision by
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the Commission that it should not go forward in that mode.
2 The decision of the Commission was based on a legal
3 analysis; there was not a factual investigation here.
4

Nonetheless,

the decision of the court below

5 suggests that the Commission must go forward.

Now, as we

6 have said in our brief, the Commission is structured in a
7 way unlike many other commissions.

It requires -- it’s a

8 six-member body, it requires the positive votes of four
9 members to bring such an action.
10

QUESTION;

What was the vote here?

11

MR. STEELE;

Unanimous?

The vote here was unanimous.

The

12 vote in all three of the earlier decisions which we have
13 referred to in our case, one advisory opinion back in 1976
14 and in the two enforcement cases in 1978, all of them were
15 unanimous.

They were all six-nothing with the exception of

16 one of the two KUR's where there were only five members
17 present, but it was also unanimous.
18

Those safeguards for the Commission's processes

19 include, as I noted, the four votes required.
20 course, the composition of the Commission.

There is, of

It is balanced

21 so that there can be no vote of four members, by all the
22 members of one party, as the statute prohibits the
23 Commission from having more than three members of any one
24 party .
25

With regard to the merits, the Commission submits
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that its interpretation was not only reasonable, but was
2 really quite consistent with the statute.

I would

3 emphasize, however, that it seems to the Commission that the
4 standard that should be here applied is not whether its
5 interpretation was the only one, but only whether its
6 interpretation in light of the act, the words of the act,
7 the context of the act, was a reasonable one.
8

So, as far as the Commission is concerned, even if

9 the statute is at least ambiguous it should prevail in this
10 case, because the interpretation placed upon it by the court
11 below that required the Commission to go forward was that
12 the statutory mandate was clear.
13

The review provision in 437g(8) provides that the

14 Commission's actions will be reviewed to see if they are
15 contrary to law.

And the Commission concedes, as I think

16 would be true even without that statute but with the
17 statutory provision there, that obviously any dismissal of a
18 complaint is reviewable by the courts.

The Commission is

19 not contesting that those decisions are not reviewable.

The

20 question is what the standard is that would be applied.
21

In examining the merits, I would urge upon this

22 Court to note, first of all, that the decision of the
23 Commission and of the District Court in no way increased the
24 limits that the statute provides for the spending in
25 question.

441a(d)CA)(3) provides that the national
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 committee of a political party may send two cents per voter
2 age population, and that the state committee may spend two
3 cents per voter age population.
4

That total, four cents for the party, has not been

5 increased by the decision of the commission below.

What the

6 decision of the commission below said was, that the state
7 party, which has a two cents per voter age population
8 authority for spending under the statute, that the state
9 party could assign that to the National Republican
10 Senatorial Committee; that there was no bar in the statute
11 to that action.
12

The argument of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign

13 Committee accepted by the court below was that the statute,
14 by providing separate limits for the national party and the
15 state party, makes explicit that that limit must be spent by
16 the national committee or must be spent by the state
17 committee, and that there could be no transfer of it.
18

Initially in 1976, when the Democratic National

19 Committee filed a complaint and then withdrew it, there was
20 an advisory opinion by the Commission.

The Commission under

21 4 37f, 2 USC 437f, is authorized to issue advisory opinions
22 to any person who requests them about specific transactions
23 in which they are engaged.
24

In that opinion, the Commission very clearly

25 stated that in its view the National Republic Congressional
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Committee there,

not the senatorial campaign committee.

The

2 two committees in question, one for the senatorial side, one
3 for

the congressional side, for the House side, are two

4 separate committees.
5 are

But for purposes of the statute, they

the same because they represent the same interests, one

6 for the Senate side, one for the House side.

The Commission’s decision in AO 1976-108

7

8 explicitly stated
9 statute,

referred to the legislative history of the 1976

10 amendments after
11

that under its interpretation of the

this Court’s decision in Buckley, that the

National Republic Congressional Committee was a committee of

12 the

National Committee of the party.

That is to say that it

13 could be — the National Committee could assign to that
14 committee its spending limits.

That the National Republic

15 Congressional Committee could spend its funds on a
16 delegation from the

Republic National Committee.

QUESTION;

17

Mr. Steele, may I ask, I noticed that

18 the only thing argued below, I
19 the agency agreements
20 transfers.
21

gather, was the validity of

and not any validity of fund

My question is this;

could everything they

attempted to do by agency agreements, they have done under

22 441a(a)(4)

by transfer of funds if the congressional

23 committees are not political committees within a(a)(4)?
24

MR. STEELEs

25 provision would

They would be — the transfer

provide it to them as political committees
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

\

1 of the same party.

And we would argue certainly, the fact

2 that they could transfer all the funds would allow them to
3 do the identical matter that they did here.
4

QUESTION;

Then why all the fuss?

What difference

5 doe s it make ?
6

HR. STEELE;

Well, the decision of the court below

7 was that there was loss of control; that here the state, by
8 giving up its spending authority to the National Republican
9 Senatorial Committee no longer retained control.
10

QUESTION;

And transferred the funds, if the

11 prohibition of a(a)(4) doesn't apply to it, and if the state
12 committee had transferred to the senatorial commmittee,
13 apparently the same thing could have been accomplished,
14 couldn 11 it?
15

MR. STEELE;

Yes.

Or by our reasoning the same

16 thing could have been accomplished by the National
17 Republican Senatorial Committee, transferring the funds —
18

QUESTION;

Under agency agreement.

19

MR. STEELE;

20

QUESTION;

Yes.
Well, my question is really, why do we

21 have to fuss over the agency agreement if they could do it
22 under a(a)(4) under the transfer provision?
23
24 indeed,

NR. STEELE;

I don't think that you do, and

I think that's the case that the Democratic

25 Senatorial Campaign Committee is trying to make.

That there

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is a difference there, but we would see no difference there.
2

QUESTIONi

While you've been interrupted may I

3 just ask., in your view is the National Republican Senatorial
4 Committee, the committee that’s a party to this case, a,
5 quote, "national committee of a political party” within the
6 meaning of 441a(d)(3)?
7

MR. STEELEi

Yes, it is.

And I would cite the

8 decision that I was just mentioning, AO 1976-108, in which
9 the Commission explicitly stated that on the basis of
10 legislative history from the 76 amendments.

That's cited at

11 — I'm sorry, I don't have the page in our brief, but it's
12 listed in our table on pages 25 and 29, and the Commission
13 there explicitly held that.
14

QUESTION:

If that's correct, then again, the case

15 is all over, isn't it?

Because they have not spent more

16 than that section permits them to spend, is that correct?

I

17 don’t quite understand why we have to even get into the
18 transfer of spending authority.
19

MR. STEELE:

I don't see why you do, either.

20 Again, I think that that is our case, and I think you're
21 stating it for me.
22

The argument on the other side, I believe, is that

23 by aggregating these two — the statute 441a(d)(3) provides
24 a two cents for the national committee and a two cents for a
25 state party committee, and that somehow the statute by
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

providing those separate limits, which we agree that that

2 allows the state committee not to transfer that to the
3

national, so that the state committee has the authority to

4

retain that spending power if it wishes, and that there’s

5

nothing in the statute — there’s no mention in the statute

6

of any prohibition of any arrangement like this, that at the

7

very best the court below had to rely on the inference that

8 by stating the two separate limits, that it meant that there
9
10

should be no transfer.
The court below also stated that its belief that

11

the purpose of the statute was to strengthen the state

12

parties — again, even conceding that that's so, which I

13

don’t think there’s much citation of legislative history to

14

support that, it would seem to us that the statute under the

15

Commission’s interpretation allows that.

16

state, if it wishes to, to retain that spending authority.

17

It allows the

To turn for just a moment to the Court of Appeals

18

decision below with regard to the question as to the

19

shifting basis, not only would we contend, as I said in

20

response to Justice Rehnquist’s question, that even had

21

there been a shift here that it enabled the agency to make

22 that kind of decision and that’s one of the purposes of
23

having this kind of process.

But we would submit that

24

throughout all three of those decisions, the basic elements

25

which I have set forth in discussing the merits, were there
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 stated.
2

The basic authority that the Commission relied on

3 in all of them, including AO 1976-108, was the transfer
4 authority.

The court said that in some of the earlier MUB’s

5 the emphasis was on that and on the failure of the statute
6 to explicitly prohibit this kind of transfer, and said that
7 later decisions of the Commission suggested a shifting basis
8 in that we then noted in this MUR in particular that later
9 developments, that the Congress had legislation specifically
10 in front of it — the House of Representatives had
11 legislation specifically in front of it which would have
12 prohibited the transfers proposed by the House
13 Administration Committee.
14

There was a rule against that bill going forward,

15 and we set forth in the decision in this case, the
16 administrative decision in this case, MUR 1234 sets forth
17 six or seven quotations from various congressmen,
18 Congressmen Frenzel, Stockman, Conable, Mikva, Davis, both
19 sides of the aisle, that the very purpose of that bill, the
20 reason that they were speaking against it, of the rule to
21 report the bill out, was because it was going to prohibit
22 these kind of transfers.
23

And on that basis we would think that the

24 Commission's decision is not only reasonable but is in
25 accord with the legislative history.
16

2

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Very well.

Mr. Baran?

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN W. BARAN, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, NRSC

5

MR. BARAN;

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please the

6 Court, petitioner. National Republican Senatorial Committee,
7 a committee of the Republican Party, seeks reversal of the
8 Court of Appeals decision, just as the Federal Election
9 Commission does.
10

Our essential reason, set forth in our brief, is

11 that the statute in question, which I'll refer to as
12 Subsection

(d)(3), simply does not prohibit the conduct that

13 the Democratic Committee is complaining of.
14

The limits, as Mr. Steele has indicated, have not

15 been exceeded with respect to the total dollar amount, and
16 it was noted so by Judge Wilke in his dissent, as well.
17 What is being complained of is a method utilized within the
18 political party for most effectively spending the money on
19 behalf of senatorial candidates.

And that method, which has

20 been used by the Republican Party in 1978 and in 1980 on
21 occasion and only voluntarily, is for the state committees
22 of the Republican Party to designated the petitioner, NRSC,
23 as an agent for purposes of spending funds on behalf of
24 these candidates.
25

The respondent has never in the course of the
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 administrative proceeding or before any of the courts below
2 suggested that the total amount of money spent for any
3 specific Senate candidate in any state has been exceeded by
4 the Republican Party.
5

Unlike the Federal Election Commission, we do

6 address the potential, although we feel unnecessary to
7 reach, constitutional issues that would arise if the Court
8 of Appeals decision were upheld.

As Judge Wilke noted in

9 his dissent, the interpretation that has been engrafted on
10 this statute by the Court of Appeals would place a
11 restriction in the way of the political party in terms of
12 most effectively supporting its Senate candidates, even
13 though it would be within the statutory limitation.
14

Unlike the compelling governmental interest that

15 has been recognized by this Court in Buckley v. Valeo, which
16 is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of
17 corruption, that interest is not advanced in furtherance of
18 any such restriction.
19

The respondent in their briefs suggest solely a

20 government interest in revitalizing the state committees of
21 the political parties.

The Republican Party is certainly

22 touched by this outpouring of concern on the part of the
23 Democratic Committee for the wellbeing of Republican state
24 committees.
25

It certainly is unprecedented, to say the least.

But in terms of actual purpose behind Subsection

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 (d)(3), there is no reflection in the legislative history,
2 as we note in our brief, that there was any intention on the
3 part of Congress when they passed Subsection (d)(3) back in
4 1974 to limit its benefits solely and narrowly to the state
5 committee.

The Congress was concerned with providing a

6 still substantial role in private financing for political
7 parties generally, but certainly not just for the state
8 committees.
9

And furthermore, as noted earlier by Mr. Steele,

10 there are provisions within the statute itself that would
11 indicate that Congress views the parties as basically one
12 large entity and one large organization within the United
13 States for financing purposes, to the point where unlike
14 virtually any other component of campaign financing, any of
15 the committees of the same party can shift unlimited funds
16 back and forth to each other; implicitly recognizing that
17 it’s up to the political parties to make a decision on how
18 to best structure their campaign financing within the
19 overall limitations contained in the act.
20

For those reasons, as set forth in greater detail

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bauer?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. BAUER, ESQ.
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

OS BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, DSCC
NR. BAUER*

Nr. Chief Justice and may it please

3 the Court, what is striking about the last few minutes of
4 argumentation offered by the FEC and the NRSC is that in
5 construing the plain language of the provision in question,
6 what Nr. Baran referred to as (d)(3), neither side offered
7 any analysis of the plain terms of that provision.
8

That is until Justice Stevens asked general

9 counsel Steele whether NRSC was a national committee within
10 the meaning of that section.

General counsel Steele

11 responded that it was, which is a mis-analysis of the plain
12 terms of the provision which lies at the heart of the
13 agency's difficulty from the beginning of this case.
14

The terms in Section (d)(3), Subsection (d)(3),

15 are not ambiguous.

They are separately defined in the

16 definitions provision of the FECA.

The definition about

17 which Justice Stevens inquired, the national committee, is
18 defined under Section 431(14) of the FECA as the
19 organization — that is, one organization -- which by virtue
20 of the bylaws of a political party is responsible for the
21 day-to-day operation of such political party at the national
22 level.
23

The NRSC is decidedly not the national committee

24 of a political party.

It is a sub-unit of the national

25 party structure, but the Commission itself has recognized
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that it is the Republican National Committee, which is not a
2 party to this case, which is the national committee under
3 Subsection (d)(3).
4

More to the point is the analysis of what state

5 committees are.

Once again, Congress separately defines

6 state committees in the definitions provision of the act,
7 and it is concededly -- in fact, conceded by all the parties
8 to this litigation -- that NRSC is not a state committee.
9

How is it, then, that the agency has construed

10 this provision, which confers defined limits on specifically
11 defined entities, to allow NRSC not named or referred to in
12 that provision to rest unto itself the limit that Congress
13 has assigned to another?
14

One of the problems in this case has been the

15 agency's inability over a course of decisionmaking to offer
16a single consistent rationale for overcoming the plain terms
17 of this provision.
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Bauer, before you get too far

19 along, it would be very helpful to me if you identified the
20 language in the statute that prohibits what the NRSC has
21 done.

Because if they're not a national committee within

22 the meaning of 441 (a ) (d)(3) , I take it 441(a)(d)(3)

just

23 simply doesn't apply to NRSC.
24

MR. BAUER;

That is absolutely correct, Justice

25 Stevens, with one exception I should note here.

And that is

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that in

1976, the Federal Election Commission promulgated a

2 regulation following oral comment, hearings and submission

3 to Congress subject to the one Rouse veto provision, which
4 purported to allow the national committee, under Subsection
5 (d)(3), to assign its spending rights to any agent.
6 was the

This

sole exception, as the FEC interpreted it at that

7 time, and as Congress approved it at that time, to the
8 defined

limits and defined committees of Subsection

9

In this litigation, however, for the first time

10 before

the Court of Appeals the FEC disavowed its prior

11 interpretation of
12

(d)(3).

this regulation and now claims that it has

no bearing whatsoever to Subsection (d)(3), but instead

13 applies only to Subsection

(d)(2) involving presidential

14 elections.
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Bauer, following up on Justice

16 Stevens’ question, where is the prohibitory language about
17 which he asked?

I’ve got open the Brief of the FEC at pages

18 2 and 3, which purportedly set forth the statutes involved.
19

MR. BAUER;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. BAUER:

22 assignments by name.

Justice Rehnquist, Congress —
For the prohibitory language -There is no language which prohibits
However, the construction of the

23 provision itself and an analysis of the relationship to that
24 provision of other provisions to the act, suggest a
25 conclusion very contrary to that suggested here by Mr.
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Baran.

Party committee limits are not fungibled.

They are

2 not assignable, unless Congress expressly so state.

And in

3 some instances — and this, it seems to us, answers the
4 argument fully -- in some instances. Congress has provided
5 precisely and specifically for the assignment of limits by
6 one party committee to another, but it has been explicit
7 where it has done so, and it as not done so in Subsection
8 (d)(3).
9

QUESTION:

So your reasoning is basically

10 expressio unius est exclusio alterius.
11

MR. BAUER:

That is correct. Justice Rehnquist.

12 It also draws strength from the point that I just suggested
13 to you,

and that is that where Congress did intend party

14 committee limits to be assignable, it expressly stated so.
15 In Subsection (d)(3), for example, Congress expressly
16 authorizes state committees to assign their limits
17 altogether to, or to share them with, subordinate committees
18 of the state party.
19

Similarly, NRSC, as a congressional committee,

20 possesses a $17,500 contribution limitation, which it is
21 expressly authorized, again by the FECA, to share with the
22 national committee of a political party, of its party.

So

23 Congress was very clear that if limits were to be assigned ,
24 it wished to have the final say-so in the matter, and it did
25 not provide for this assignment authority in Subsection
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 (d)(3).
2

QUESTION:

3

MR. BAUER:

Mr. Bauer, what about a(a)(4)?
a(a)(4) also does not have the effect,

4 it decidedly does not have the effect, of rendering the
5 limits themselves, the integrity of the limits, for party
6 committees and nullity.

It is essentially the position of

7 the FEC that because party committees can transfer funds
8 freely among themselves, then the limits that Congress has
9 given specific party committees should be disregarded.
10

QUESTION:

But if the congressional committees do

11 not fall within the prohibition of 431a(a)(4), why can't
12 they clearly exchange with the state committees?
13

MR. BAUER:

They absolutely can exchange funds

14 freely with the state committees, Justice Brennan.
15 they cannot do — they can exchange money.
16 freely traded.

What

Money may be

What cannot be freely traded or assigned is

17 the spending authority itself, which Congress made specific
18 to different party committees.

Money may pass freely, but

19 congressionally-assigned spending rights may not.

What may they do with the money?

21 may transfer it freely.

What we're talking about now was only

And that is that Congress has been

14 continually concerned that state party committees have a

16 in the electoral process.

They have provided for an array

17 of special spending provisions which state party committees
18 and only those committees may use.

20 assuming that the NSSC is not a national committee within
21 the meaning of 441a(3), where in the statute is there a
22 prohibition against NRSC expending money?
23

MR. BAUER;

There is no prohibition, certainly, on

24 NRSC expending money, Justice Stevens.

In fact, NRSC has in

25 Section 441a(h) a discrete contribution limitation which it
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Justice Stevens, the problem lies in

24 the history of this litigation.

There used to be, until the

25 FEC disavowed it, an additional source of spending by NRSC

8 considerably substantial one,

NRSC with a

absolutely correct that by receiving an assignment of funds
from the state party committees -- excuse me, receiving an

11 assignment of authority from the state party committees,
12

13

violated 441a(h).

15

Absent the regulation.

QUESTION:

14

It, in fact,

Did they violate any section other than

441 a(h)?

16

MR. BAUER;

Ho, Your Honor, they did not.

17

The question of whether or not party committee

18

limits have been deemed by Congress to be specific can be

19

answered by reference to the legislative history of

20 Subsection
21

(d)(2).

That provision, leaving aside its plain

terms which do not refer to NRSC, was enacted in 1974, and

22 the legislative history shows that Congress was well aware
23

of the congressional committees in 1974.

In fact, there was

24

pending on the floor of the Senate at that time a proposal

25

to exempt the congressional committees altogether from
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 spending limits, and that proposal was rejected.
2

In

1976, the question of NRSC spending authority

3 was raised yet again, and this time it was raised through a
4 $17,500 contribution limit, which it shares with the
5 national committee of its party.

But not at that time nor

6 in the years before did Congress elect to confer upon NRSC a
7 share in the state committee's spending authority under
8 Subsection (d)(3).

It was a considered question by

9 Congress, and Congress addressed it forthrightly.
10

Similarly, the transfer provision is no answer.

11 While it is true that funds can be transferred freely
12 between committees, it is also clear from the scheme of the
13 act and its legislative history that party committee limits
14 are not fungible.

Unless Congress has expressly stated that

15 those limits are to be shared or assigned, and it has in the
16 provisions I cited to Justice Rehnquist, assignability is
17 barred.
18

In the last analysis, the FEC and NRSC in this

19 case have shrugged their shoulders and said, what difference
20 does it make; form over substance.

It doesn't matter

21 whether the state committees spend the funds or whether NRSC
22 does.
23

Respondent submits that the question of form or

24 substance in matters of policy are not for the agency to
25 make.

It is for Congress to make policy judgments in the
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 election scheme.

2

In any event, the question of form which is before

3 this Court, is decidedly one of substance.

For in this

4 Subsection (d)(3), as in other provisions of the act which
5 I’ve cited in the colloquy with Justice Rehnguist, Congress
6 made specific provision for special spending rights by state

7 committees and their subordinate units, and it did so
8 because of a very strongly expressed concern that these

9 committees would not be in a position to maintain their role
10

absent this special provisions of Congress.
The record in this case shows that the

11

12 congressional concern was by no

means unfounded, for

13 uncontroverted in that record is evidence that in 1978 when
14 these state committee-NRSC authority assignments were first
15 made, state party committees spent virtually no money under
16 the authority provided under Subsection (d)(3).
17
18 it?

QUESTION*

But that was their own choice, wasn’t

I mean, they’re not compelled to make their assignment

19 to the national senatorial committee.
20

MR. BAUER:

21 At the same time,

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

Congress did not foreclose from holding

22 out an incentive to these entities to try to maintain their

23 own place.

And certainly, the availability of this

24 assignment authority only makes it easier for state
25 committees to essentially abdicate the role.

It is far

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 easier for a national fund-raising base like NRSC to raise
2 the money for congressional elections across the country
3 than for, say, the state committees of Missouri, Kentucky,
4 Iowa and Alabama.

Yet Congress held out to those committees

5 that incentive to do so, to raise the money and then spend
6 it in their own congressional elections, and the
7 assignability of those limits completely contradicts this
8 congressional purpose.
9

So it is that the record shows that through this

10 spending pattern, Section 441a(d)(3) has essentially been
11 stood on its head.

What was intended as an incentive to

12 state and local party organizations has instead been turned
13 into a supplement to national fund raising power.

And as

14 this court noted in Buckley, in an age of media politics,
15 expensive polling techniques and other refined forms of
16 campaigning, money, very expensive money, certainly talks.
17 And without the special provision made for the state
18 committees, the aggregation of power will be pulled further
19 and further toward the national center of the country, which
20 is a result Congress sought to avoid.

11 significance -12

QUESTION;

What is it that they have to spend the

13 $50,000 on?
14

ME. BAUEB:

Well, this is — that is probably the

15 most significant point in our case, Justice Brennan, and it
16 goes to what Justice Stevens asked me about NBSC's own
17 spending limit.
18

Let us assume for purposes here, without again

19 addressing the FEC regulation, that NBSC is limited to
20 $17,500 to a candidate.

And let us assume that a state

21 committee then transfer to NBSC $50,000.

All that NBSC can

22 do to influence the outcome of a specific candidate's
23 election is spend $17,500.

MR. BAUER*

Presumably/ NRSC makes some

2 arrangement to spend it for some other purpose, but not in
3 congressional elections, which is precisely why if the
4 committee's limits were respected, the additional money that
5 the committee would retain at the state and local level —
6

QUESTION:

Now, if the state committee had kept

7 the $50,000, what may they do with it?
8

MR. BAUER:

They may make a contribution to a

9 candidate of $5000 per election; they may make expenditures
10 equivalent to two cents multiplied by the voting age
11 population of the state.
12

QUESTION:

But those are limitations on how much

13 of the $50,000 they may spend on a particular candidate.
14

MR. BAUER:

That's precisely correct, Justice

15 Brennan .
16

QUESTION:

In this case, what do they propose to

17 do with this money?
18

MR. BAUER:

The NRSC took the transfers of

19 authority from the state committees, thereby substantially
20 increasing its own limit, and indeed —
21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BAUER:

But has it distributed any money?
It has distributed millions under this

25 the money.

MB. BAUER:

That is correct.

They have used state

2 committee authority, and NRSC has spent the money, its
3 money, for -4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BAUER*

And you say they can't do either.
It may receive the transfers, hut it

6 may not double its own limit with the limit of the state
7 committees.
8

QUESTION:

Let me back up a little, Mr. Eauer.

If

9 you have addressed the question of the interpretation placed
10 on this statute by the agency I missed it.

Now certainly,

11 of all the agencies created by Congress, I would assume that
12 the people selected for this kind of a commission, which is
13 unique, three from each party — is that correct?
14

MR. BAUER:

15

QUESTION:

That’s correct, sir.
Would hardly be political neophytes.

16 They'd be people who are very sophisticated politically,
17 which might not necessarily be true of an appointee to the
18 Federal Communications Commission or Federal Power
19 Commission, who might or might not be sophisticated in the
20 particular area.
21

Now, what weight should be given by the Judiciary

22 to the interpretation of the congressional mandate by this
23 uniquely expert and sophisticated commission?
24 are my objectives.

Now, those

You don't have to adopt them.

What

25 weight should be given?

MR. BAUERs

Chief Justice Burger,

I think they

2 should receive the substantial weight and the substantial
3 deference that is ordinarily accorded, perhaps no more than
4 that, to agencies that are charged with administering
5 particular statutes.

But this case really raises the

6 threshold to something very different.

And that is the

7 question of whether an agency can disrespect the law.
8

The plain terms of this provision, and the

9 construction of the statute as a whole suggests that they
10 are permitting the bandying about the assignment of
11 authority which Congress intended to be specific to
12 particular committees.
13

Now, if there was room open under this provision

14 for different interpretations of which committees may spend
15 and which committees may not, respondent might not be here.
16 But this provision could not be clearer.

Congress selected

17 particular terms and then went to great lengths to define
18 them.
19

QUESTIONS

But it seemed clear just the other way

20 to the six members of the Commission who passed on it
21 initially, is that not so?
22

MR. BAUEF.s

That's correct, Your Honor.

But

23 respondent submits, and as a committee subject to the
24 continuing regulation of the Federal Election Commission it
25 has a special stake in expressing its concern, that
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 unanimity of opinion on that agency not be considered
2 sufficient to overcome the plain terms of any provision.
3

QUESTION;

Even your own Democrats.

4

MR. BAUER:

5 Brennan.

Honest differences of opinion, but on this case we

Even our own Democrats, Justice

6 happen to think we have the law on our side.
7

QUESTION:

Mr. Bauer, can I go back to the statute

8 again, because I think I'm beginning to understand your
9 argument.
10

(General laughter.)

11

If I understand it, you're saying that Subsection

12 (h) which places a limit on the contributions the National
13 Republican Senatorial Committee can make to any state
14 candidate is $17,500.

And that when it spends more money

15 than that in behalf of the candidate, it is, in effect,
16 making an additional contribution to the candidate.
17

MR. BAUER:

That is absolutely correct, Justice

18 Stevens.
19

QUESTION:

And therefore, you've violated the

20 prohibition against contributions in excess of this amount.
21

MR. BAUER:

And I might emphasize to nail that

22 point home, because I know you're eager for me to do so,
23 that the act specifically defines Subsection

24 expenditures as contributions.

(d)(2)

There has been much weight

25 placed for constitutional purposes by NRSC on the identity
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of this spending as, quote, "expenditures.”

Eut the statute

2 itself defines coordinated expenditures, expenditures which
3 are arranged with the candidate, as no different
4 functionally than contributions.
5

QUESTION:

So your violation in this case that you

6 rely on is the amount over $17,500 that they spend for any
7 given candidate.

Does the record tell us whether they did,

8 in fact, spend more than $17,500?
9

MR. BAUER.*

Yes, it does.

The Joint Appendix of

10 the Court of Appeals has notarized affidavits with
11 substantial figures for each state.
12

QUESTION:

I'm just amazed that nobody quoted

13 Subsection (h) in their briefs.
14

MR. BAUER:

Well, Your Honor, one of the murkier

15 moments in this litigation was,

I fear, created by the

16 Federal Election Commission because it used to be that -17

QUESTION:

But one of the beauties of the

18 adversary system is we don’t have to rely on our adversary
19 to quote the relevant statutory language.
20

MR. BAUER:

That is correct.

But the regulation

21 which we relied on to suggest that maybe NRSC had a higher
22 than $17,500 contribution limit, that regulation was in
23 force until all of a sudden in this litigation the FEC
24 changed its mind, said it didn't apply.

So a regulation

25 interpreted one way —
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

2

MR. BAUER;

How much higher than $17,500 was -It was the two

cents per voting age

3 population in each state as agent of the National Committee
4 of the political party.
5

QUESTION;

6

MR. BAUER;

And that could amount to how much?
It could amount, under the figures in

7 the Joint Appendix, to slightly in excess of three million
8 dollars, nationally.
9

So it was in light of that confusion over what

10 precisely NRSC's spending authority was that I think all
11 parties backed away from addressing themselves forthrightly
12 to 441a(h) versus perhaps some other provision.
13

While I do

14 attention here, NRSC

not believe that it merits excessive
has offered yet

another in a long

15 string of interpretations to support the FEC's position.
16 And that is a constitutional claim, which I do not think
17 this Court need reach in light of the plain terms of the
18 provision.
19

The NRSC's claim has to be understood first of all

20 as not a challenge to the constitutionality of any
21 limitation on state party committee spending.

None of the

22 parties to this litigation are quarreling over whether
23 Congress can constitutionally limit political party
24 spending .

The question instead is whether, within this

25 overall scheme of limits, Congress may direct that certain
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 committees can spend a certain amount and other committees a
2 different amount for specific and well-defined purposes.
3

There is no evidence in the record certainly to

4 support NRSC's contention that its First Amendment rights
5 are impermissibly burdened by an agency proscription.

Nor

6 is it likely that that evidence could be developed.
7 Political parties have exceptionally, exceptionally broad
8 avenues cf spending participation available to them under
9 the act.

Avenues which are not available to non-party

10 committees, and Subsection
11

(d)(3) is one example.

And whatever infringement may, in fact, result

12 from proscribing these agency agreements and enforcing
13 congressional will, they are certainly marginal when
14 measured against the government’s very compelling concern
15 with maintaining the state and local political party role in
16 the electoral process.
17
18 at heart.

That’s a concern which, of course, is Federalist
There is a substantial body of scholarly opinion

19 supporting the view that this is absolutely necessary, and
20 we would not be quarreling about it if the agency in this
21 case had done what we urge this Court now to do, and that is
22 affirm the Court of Appeals decision below, have Subsection
23 (d)(3) construed as it was written, and thereby bring the
24 agency back into conformity with the rule of law under this
25 statutory scheme.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Do you have anything

2 further, Mr. Steele?
3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES N. STEELE, ESQ.

4

OS BEHALF OF PETITIONER, FEC — REBUTTAL

5

MR. STEELE;

6 441a(h)

With regard to the question of why

was not set forth in the briefs, the fact is that

7 the complaint that was lodged with the Comission alleged a
8 violation of 441a(d)(3), and perhaps I might just refer,
9 Justice Stevens, you to that section as seeming to set forth
10 the prohibition that you were asking for.
11

The beginning of that Section, a(d)(1), says,

12 “notwithstanding any other provision of law with respect to
13 limitations on expenditures or limitations on contributions,
14 the national committee of a political party and a state
15 committee of a political party, including any subordinate
16 committee, may make expenditures in connection with the
17 general election campaign of candidates for federal office,
18 subject to the limitations set forth."
19
20 and

Those limitations are set forth in Subsections (2)
(3).

(2) pertains to the presidential election.

(3),

21 which was what was put at issue before the Commission and
22 before the courts, pertains to the congressional elections.
23

QUESTION;

I understand that.

But my problem all

24 along has been, and I think Justice Rehnquist may have made
25a similar observation, that this is authorizing language,
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 it's not prohibitory language, in

(1),

(2) and (3).

And I

2 have to start with a prohibition somewhere in the statute in
3 order to find a violation.
4

MR. STEELE:

5

QUESTION:

I understand.

The prohibition —

Do you not agree that what you've

6 referred to is authorizing language.
7

SR. STEELE:

Yes, it is.

The prohibition

8 language, in almost perhaps an inverted way, comes in
9 Subsection (3) where it says, "the national committee of a
10 political party or a state committee of a political party,
11 including any subordinate committee, may not make any
12 expenditure in connection with the general election campaign
13 of a candidate for federal office in a state who is
14 affiliated with such party, which exceeds..."
15

QUESTION:

I understand that.

But, of course,

16 then the one issue is whether or not NRSC is, quote,

"The

17 National Committee," and your opponent says that's a term
18 defined in the statute, and that this is not that particular
19 committee.
20

MR. STEELE:

21 the national committee.

Yes.

And as we have said, it is not

What we have set forth in the brief

22 and in the advisory opinion that I referred you to, is that
23 there are subordinate committees of the national committee.
24 Indeed, DSCC itself makes expenditures on behalf of the DNC,
25 and that that delegation has never been questioned.

That is

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the delegation explicitly set forth in 110.7 of our
2 regulations.

So that the delegation by the national

3 committee of its spending authority to subordinate
4 committees has been accepted by the Commission.
5

QUESTION.*

Let me again just put to one side

6 delegation questions.

Did I correctly understand you in

7 your opening argument to take the position that the National
8 Republican Senatorial Committee is, quote, "a national
9 committee" within the meaning of (d)(3)?
10

MR. STEELE:

It is a subordinate committee; it is

11 not the national committee.
12

QUESTION;

It is not the national committee now.

13 But is it a committee referred to in (d)(3)?

There's no

14 other language -- oh, you say it is a subordinate committee
15 of what?
16

MR. STEELE:

17

QUESTION:

Of the national committee.
But there is no reference to

18 subordinate committee of the national committee in (d)(3),
19 is there ?
20

MR. STEELE;

That's correct.

That was the

21 question posed to the Commission in AO 1976-108 where the
22 Commission, again relying on the statutory history of the
23 1976, the conference report of the 1976 amendments, came to
24 the conclusion it's the view of the Commission that the
25 specified campaign committees are committees of their
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 respective national political parties.

And on that basis

2 seized them as being -- we set forth in a footnote in our
3 brief the various committees.

So the Commission has viewed

4 the national committee as having many subordinate committees,
5

I apologize if my answer earlier misled you.

6

QDESTIOSi

I’m still, I must confess but I’ll

7 study it further, a little uncertain of your position on
8 whether the statute itself in (d)(3) makes reference to the
9 National Republican Senatorial Committee, which isn't
10 mentioned by name in Subsection (h).
11

MS. STEELE:

Yes, that was a later enacted

12 statute, I might note.
13 was passed in 1974.
14 a(d)(3).

That was passed in 1976, and a(d)(3)

It is not specifically mentioned in

The Commission’s position would be that it is —

15 that NRSC and the DSCC are subordinates to the national —
16

QUESTION:

But that section also does not mention

17 subordinate committees of the national committee.
18

MR. STEELE:

19

QUESTION:

That’s correct.
So what is the legal significance of

20 classifying those committees as subordinate committees of
21 the national committee?
22

MR. STEELE:

I really have lost the argument.
The significance of it is that they

23 are all part of the same national committee, as far as the
24 Commission is concerned.
25

QUESTION:

They are branches of the same —

You construe the statute as though it
46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 read, the national committee of a political party or any
2 subordinate committee of a national committee of a political
3 party may —
4

MR. STEELE:

Yes.

Which is not explicit in the

5 statute.
