ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA E. ETKIND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. ETKIND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is here on the petition of the

11

Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy to

12

review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals

13

for the District of Columbia circuit.

14

The statute involved is Section 106 of Public

15

Law 92-129, which was enacted in 1971 and which forbids

16

discrimination against United States citizens or

17

dependents by the Department of Defense in its

18

employment of civilians on military bases overseas

19

unless "prohibited by treaty."

20

The single question presented by this case is

21

whether the word "treaty" as used in that statute refers

22

to all finding international agreements to which the

23

United States is a party, or is limited solely to those

24

agreements that have been approved by the Senate

25

pursuant to Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.

1

In 1944 Congress authorized the President by

2

such means as he should find appropriate to withhold or

3

to acquire and to retain such military and naval bases

4

as he deemed necessary for the mutual protection of the

5

United States and the Philippines.

6

President found appropriate were two international

7

agreements;

8

the United States and the Philippines, and the

9

Supplemental 1968 Base Labor Agreement, which is at

The means the

11

submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent.

12

Neither of these agreements was ever

In the Military Bases Agreement the United

13

States obtained, among other things, the 99-year use of

14

several designated military bases located in the

15

Philippines, as well as the right upon only notice to

16

the Philippines to the use of additional facilities

17

there as required by military necessity.

18

The major military facilities currently used

19

by the United States in the Philippines are the Clark

20

Air Base and the naval facility at Subic Bay.

21

Article I of the Base Labor Agreement provides

22

that the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines

23

will fill its needs for civilian employment on these

24

bases with Filipino citizens except when the needed

25

skills are found not to be locally available, or for

Ms. Etkind, as of this date has

that agreement been amended?
MS. ETKIND;

6

The Base Labor Agreement has not

been amended, no.

7

QUESTION;

8

MS. ETKIND;

9

In

Okay.

Thank you.

In those cases. United States

nationals may be employed.
When Section 106 was passed in 1971 there were

10

11

in existence approximately a dozen additional such

12

agreements in which the United States provided some form

13

of employment preference for local nationals in exchange

14

for the use of valuable strategic facilities located

15

abroad.

16

In March

1978 four of the respondents in this

17

case were notified that their jobs as game room managers

18

at the United States naval facility at Subic Bay were

19

being converted into local national positions in

20

accordance with Article I of the Base Labor Agreement,

21

and that they would be discharged from their employment

22

with the Navy.

23

The four respondents subsequently were

24

discharged, and after exhausting their administrative

25

remedies, they filed this action in the United States

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

District Court for the District of Columbia, claiming

2

that their discharges violated Section 106, among other

3

provisions.

4

Approximately 30 additional plaintiffs joined

5

in this suit, alleging either that they had expressed

6

interest in civilian employment with the United States

7

Navy in the Philippines but had failed to obtain such

8

employment because of the local national employment

9

preference contained in the agreement, or that they had

10

been rejected for a specific civilian position with the

11

Navy in the Philippines because the positions for which

12

they had applied were reserved for local nationals under

3
4

Article I of the Base Labor Agreement.
The District Court denied Respondents' claim

5

and granted summary judgment for the Petitioners on the

6

ground that the word "treaty" as used in Section 106

7

encompasses all binding international agreements,

8

including the Base Labor Agreement.

MS. ETKIND*

Yes.

That hasn't been challenged

in this case.
QUESTION*

Well, is it a valid agreement

without Senate approval?
MS. ETKIND*

There’s no question that the

agreement though?

An agreement for —
Is there some way of telling at a

glance whether an executive agreement has to have Senate

approval before it becomes binding or —

way.

9

There really isn't a

As we point out in our —
QUESTION*

Well, what about this one?

MS. ETKIND*

10

No, no.

This one follows — almost all of

11

the agreements that — Base Labor Agreements that

12

provide for national employment preferences are in the

13

forms of congressional executive authority.
QUESTION*

14

Well, is there any authority to say

15

that those are agreements, valid agreements, rather than

16

treaties, or is that just -- that's just the view of the

17

United States, I suppose.
MS. ETKIND*

18
19
20

They've always been recognized as

such .
QUESTION*

Ms. Etkind, in this particular

21

instance did not Congress in 1944 pass specific

22

legislation authorizing the President to negotiate this

23

agreement with tha Philippines?

24

MS. ETKIND*

25

Clearly.

And that is why I

referred to it as a congressional executive agreement,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which is accorded somewhat more status than an executive

2

agreement entered into solely on the basis of

3

presidential authority.
QUESTION:

4
5

Hell, Congress couldn't waive the

necessity to have Senate approval for a treaty, could it?

6

MS. ETKIND:

7

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?
Congress couldn't waive the

8

necessity for having Senate approval for a treaty, could

9

it?

10

MS. ETKIND:

No, for something that had to be

11

12

QUESTION:

13

is a treaty or not.

14

Well, my question was whether this

MS. ETKIND:

This is — it is a treaty in the

15

sense of an international agreement which is between

16

countries which deals with broad subject matters that is

17

the types of things other than contracts between

18

individual parties within other nations.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I guess the issue -- nobody

20

has raised the issue in this case anyway, so I’m sorry

21

to have interrupted you.

22

MS. ETKIND:

23

QUESTION:

No one has raised it.

Thank you.

Well, I gather anyway the question

24

is whether when Congress used ''treaty" in this statute

25

it intended to include what have come to be known as

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

executive agreements, isn't that it?
t

MS. ETKIND:

2

3

the case, yes.

4

That's exactly the question in

The District —

QUESTION:

Is it not possible that in some

5

contexts the use of the word "treaty" in a statute might

6

include exactly these agreements made without the

7

approval of the Senate and in other contexts it might

8

not.
MS. ETKIND:

9
10

QUESTION:

MS. ETKIND:

17
18
19

No.

That's exactly the question

here.
QUESTION:

15
16

Is this basically any different

from construing a statute as to the intent of Congress?

13
14

And in holding

that —

11
12

Certainly, yes.

Isn't that what we're confronted

with?
MS. ETKIND:

What did Congress intend by the

use of the word "treaty" in Section 106.
QUESTION:

Well, it would be a fairly unusual

20

situation in which Congress passed legislation

21

authorizing the President to enter into a treaty in the

22

sense of a document that requires confirmation and

23

ratification by the Senate, too, isn't it?

24
25

MS. ETKIND:

That would be very unusual,

because that way the Senate already would have some

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

control

2

In holding that —

3

QUESTION;

4

May I ask another question?

Isn't

it also a question of what the word "prohibited" means?
i

5

MS. ETKIND;

6

QUESTION;

7
8
9

That's —
Because the treaty surely doesn’t

prohibit the discrimination it refers to, does it?
MS. ETKIND;

Well, no.

Even the Court of

Appeals though that held against us construed the word

10

— the phrase "unless prohibited by treaty" to mean

11

unless permitted or provided —

12

QUESTION;

The word "prohibited" we should

13

construe to mean "permitted.”

14

the Government?

15

MS. ETKIND;

16

QUESTION;

17

MS. ETKIND;

No.

Is that the position of

Well —

It is, isn't it?
It is, in effect, but by parsing

18

the statutory language carefully you can see that in

19

fact what it is is a double negative.

20

QUESTION;

It wouldn't make any sense

21

otherwise, I agree, but that's exactly, it seems to me,

22

exactly what you're arguing;

23

"permitted."

24
25

MS. ETKIND;

"prohibited" means

Well, except to the extent that

you said that it's — it's — what is prohibited is not

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to discriminate
QUESTION:

2

Well, but there’s nothing in the

3

statute — well — or is it required, unless required by

4

treaty?

5

the word means, "prohibited" is supposed to mean?

6
7

8
9

10

Is it required or permitted?

MS. ETKIND:

What is it that

Well, in this case certainly it’s

required and permitted by the treaty.
QUESTION:

So "prohibited" means either

"required" or "permitted."
MS. ETKIND:

We point to that use of the word

11

"prohibited" as an example of how Congress was not

12

really focusing in and being terribly specific when it

13

enacted the statute.

14

In ruling for us, the District Court relied

15

primarily on the concededly sparse legislative history

16

which the court found argued against Respondents’

17

contention that Congress intended to ban all

18

discrimination on military bases abroad, even when

19

pursuant to an agreement between nations.

20

The Court of Appeals reversed.

While it

21

agreed with Petitioners that the mere use of the word

22

"treaty" is not dispositive and that the meaning of the

23

word ultimately depends on Congress’ intent in enacting

24

the particular provision in which the term appears, it

25

concluded that Congress had used the word "treaty" in

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Section 106 in its constitutional sense, and that it

2

accordingly had intended sub silentio to place the

3

United States in breach of all existing international

4

agreements containing local national employment

5

preferences.
QUESTION*

6
7

were. Miss -MS. ETKIND;

8

9

How many of those did you say there

QUESTION*

11

MS. ETKIND:

3

At the time Section

106 was enacted there were about 12.

10

12

Excuse me.

How many are there today?
There's about the same number

because five were enacted subsequently, but the five
that were with Taiwan have been abrogated.
As the Court of Appeals recognized, the mere

4
5

invocation of the word "treaty” is not dispositive of

6

whether the term is being used in its narrow

7

constitutional sense or whether it is intended to

8

encompass all binding international agreements to which

9

the United States is a party.

20

QUESTION*

Does the legislative history tell

21

us how much of the problem at that' time was the result

22

of local agreements by commanding officers as opposed to

23

some kind of executive agreement resulting in the

24

problem?

25

MS. ETKIND:

Well, the only example that is

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

pointed to in the sparse legislative history is that of

a commanding officer.

Do you know whether any constitutional

As far as I know, no Article II

treaty has covered an agreement giving local hiring

preferences.

2UESTI0N:

So these local hiring things have

always been by —
MS. ETKIND:

International agreements other

than Article II treaties.
Accordingly, the word "treaty" in Section

106

6

must be interpreted in light of the purposes Congress

7

sought to serve by the enactment of that provision.

8

our view, given the sparse and largely superficial

9

legislative history of Section 106, it is conceivable

10

that Congress' purpose in enacting that statute could

11

have been the drastic one of placing the United States

12

in breach of all non-Article II agreements that

13

contained local national employment preferences.

14

In

Section 106 was only a very small part of what

15

became Public Law No. 92-129, an act to amend the

16

Military Selective Service Act of 1967 to increase

17

military pay and for other purposes.

18

legislative debate was devoted to the provision, and

19

only a few Senators addressed themselves to what became

20

Section 106.

21

measure that was considered was a salutary one of

22

improving the financial circumstances and therefore the

23

morale of American service members overseas.

Indeed, the only consequence of the

But as I alluded to earlier, at the time
Section 106 was enacted, there were in existence

non-Article II agreements to which the United States was

2

a party and which provided some form of employment

3

preference for local national in exchange for the United

4

States’ right to use military facilities located in the

5

host country.

6

To many of the countries with which we have

7

such agreements, particularly to the Philippines, the

8

United States' satisfaction of its needs for civilian

9

employment of local nationals is a significant guid pro

10

quo for the host countries permitting the United States

11

to use facilities located on its sovereign territory;

12

yet nowhere in the legislative history is even one of

13

these international agreements mentioned, much less did

14

Congress express any concern for the drastic

15

consequences that a statute placing the United States in

16

breach of such agreements could have on this nation’s

17

continuing access to necessary strategic facilities or

18

on the United States’ relations with the contracting

19

countries in general.

20

QUESTION:

Do you question the power of

21

Congress to do this if we were to interpret it as the

22

Respondents would have us do so?

23
24
25

NS. ETKIND:

No, we do not.

Congress clearly

had the power to do it.
No consideration was even given to the impact

But here, where there are two equally

reasonable constructions of the word "treaty," that

usage should be chosen which will place the United —

international obligations that Congress expressed

absolutely no intention to breach.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Our construction of the word "treaty" renders

2

Section 106 fully capable of meeting the goals Congress

sought to serve by its enactment.

them was the prevention of discrimination against

Americans or their dependents by virtue of directives by

11

In addition to the legislative debate's focus

12

on the action of General Phipps, which we have detailed

in our brief, the very fact that all of the examples

14

listed in Section 106 — officers clubs, postal

15

exchanges, and commissary stores — are non appropriated

16

fund activities, as were the positions within General

17

Phipps' control, suggests that it was indeed his action

18

Congress had in mind when it enacted that provision.

or any of the pre-existing agreements runs afoul of

2

Section 106.

3

Moreover, subsequent Congresses have

4

encouraged the executive branch to review and attempt to

5

renegotiate existing international agreements in order

6

to enhance employment opportunities for United States

7

citizens and dependents overseas, but only to the extent

8

feasible.

9

prodding of the executive branch is based on any

Nowhere is there any suggestion that this

10

perception that the continued employment of local

11

nationals pursuant to non-Article II treaties violates

12

Section 106.

13

To the contrary, these exhortations assume the

14

continuing existence and vitality of non-Article II

15

agreements providing for local national preferences,

16

notwithstanding Section 106; and they nearly urge the

17

executive branch to do what it can within the recognized

18

constraints on it to ameliorate the shortage of jobs

19

available to American citizens and dependents overseas.

20

This post-enactment legislative history

21

suggests that another purpose Congress may have had in

22

enacting Section 106, a purpose that also fully comports

23

with the use of the word "treaty” in its broader sense,

24

was simply to let the executive branch know that

25

Congress was concerned there were more — I’m sorry --

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that there were not more jobs available to United States

2

citizens and dependents on military bases abroad.

3

By the treaty exception contained in Section

4

106 Congress recognized the necessity in some cases for

5

the executive to offer the quid pro quo of local

6

national employment in order to secure the use of

7

strategically necessary military facilities.

8

Nevertheless, Congress was sending the executive branch

9

a message which it was to repeat in the future, to the

10

effect that were possible, it should attempt to avoid

11

reducing the number of jobs available to Americans.

12

Construing the word "treaty" in Section 106 as

13

extending to all binding international agreements

14

renders both the ban on employment discrimination

15

contained in that provision and the treaty exception to

16

it reasonable and meaningful.

17

the word "treaty" as limited to Article II treaties, as

18

Respondents urge, would vitiate the treaty exception

19

altogether since, as Respondents concede, there were no

20

Article II treaties that provided for local national

21

employment preferences at the time Section 106 was

22

enacted, and any subsequent Article II treaty that might

23

do so could supersede a previous inconsistent statute.

25

By contrast, to construe

1

Yes

But most significantly, to

2

construe the word "treaty" in its narrow constitutional

sense when the equally reasonable, broader construction

is available is unnecessarily to attribute to Congress a

purpose to bring about drastic international and

6

military consequences that Congress never once indicated

it intended.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDY M. MOTT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

12

MR. MOTT*

13
14
15

Mr. Mott.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court*
The case before the Court today is unique in

16

one important respect.

The four lead plaintiffs in this

17

action in the District Court actually had jobs at the

18

U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay.

19

One was a retired Navy enlisted person, one was a

20

resident American in the Philippines, and two were

21

American dependents.

22

they were losing their job, not because of their

23

performance on the job but because their job had been

24

changed because they were U.S. citizens, and the job was

25

now going to be labeled a local national job, and they

They were all Americans.

They all received notices that

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

could no longer keep the job.

2

They perhaps more graphically —

3

QUESTION!

Most of our cases here are just the

4

reverse, that you can't get a job because you're not a

5

citizen.
HE. MOTT:

6

That's right.

As Senator Schweiker

7

pointed out in the history of this measure, this is

8

perhaps unique in the annals of certainly the western

9

world that a country would discriminate against its own

10

citizens.

11

I think that —

12

QUESTION:

Isn't there some difference in the

13

setting in which that distinction occurs and the reasons

14

for it?

15

MR. MOTT:

The distinction being?

16

QUESTION:

If we couldn't get bases in foreign

17

countries on any other terms, is there any question

18

about the soundness of doing it that way, laying aside

19

the statute?

20

MR. MOTT:

No.

And, of course, our position

21

would recognize that.

In fact, in any case such as that

22

the executive would be free to submit to the Senate a

23

version for agreement.

24

affirm the Court of Appeals, the executive could simply

25

take the agreements it deems essential and submit them

There's no prospective —

Well, that could only be for the

3

future, though, couldn't it?

4

MS. MOTT:

Excuse me?

5

QUESTION:

I mean this -- this Philippine

6

one.

If we agree with you, I gather it’s completely

7

ineffective, isn't it?

8

MR. MOTT:

As it is now, that's right.

9

QUESTION:

And it could be effective, I

10

gather, under your submission only for the future, if it

11

went to the Congress and the Congress then modified it.

12

MR. MOTT:

That’s right.

And, of course, we

13

are not — and I would add to this, in the event the

14

practice was determined unlawful, there’s no District

15

Court order on relief here.

16

under Title VII in race and sex cases there wouldn't be

17

wholesale bumping out of the incumbent employees.

18

would be some equitable arrangement worked out.

our position is the — prospectively there are a lot

there would be agreements construed to require

Now, of course, not all those jobs — there

MR. MOTT;

Hell, we know as follows.

We know

24

that the Department of Defense told Senator Schweiker in

25

the hearings on the 1971 measure that it was the policy

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

of the United States to encourage the hiring of U.S.

2

citizens, not local nationals? that there had been some

3

trouble with it in the past but that they were embarking

4

on a new frontier, and they actually anticipated giving

5

dependents a preference over others.

6

in the legislative history of the measure that became

7

the Schweiker amendment.

8
9

That was in 1971,

We know that Senator Schweiker in the floor
debates said that what had happened in Europe, the one

10

example in the legislative history cited by the

11

government had been corrected.

12

unanimously felt that that one incident had already been

rendered moot and had by the executive's own position at

the time been inconsistent with the position of the

The DOD instructions, which we have included

19

in the — a couple of passages from in the — in our

20

brief, the DOD instruction from 1974, for example, says

that dependents are to get a preference only to the

22

extent of treaties and agreements requiring local

national preferences.

24

least on paper, in the Department of Defense for local

25

commanders to do this and apparently never has been.

So that's there no option, at

1

The key# though, is even internally in the

2

Department of Defense there’s a distinction between

3

treaty and other agreements, and in particular, the 1961

4

policy that was in effect and was the circular in effect

5

at the time of this legislation, provided -- and I think

6

this is extremely important to keep in mind — the

7

policy at the time provided the military departments

8

will, consistent with status of forces agreements,

9

country to country agreements and treaties, make the

10

maximum feasible reduction in the number of local

11

national employees for nonappropriated fund activities.

2

That was in 1961 and was the policy then in

3

effect for the Department of Defense.

So there was no

policy of local commanders being allowed to create side

5

arrangements whereby there were local national

preferences.

done in practice, and there's a larger number of them

There is

dispute that the question is one for Congress to

strikes me that your construction of the word "treaty"

could be an implied proviso to every act of Congress,

MR. MOTT*

The question is what has it said.

And it

10

the language has been — has required clear

11

inconsistency and some other phrases such as even going

13

Congress excluded — included the treaty proviso in

14

this, you have to look at what was happening in the 82nd

15

Congress.

16

The point Congress — and why

They were lamenting that the executive was

17

doing too much by executive agreement and not enough by

18

treaty, and by saying that, they were contemplating

19

there might have to be exceptions to the rule, and they

20

were making explicit what might have been otherwise

21

implicit, but they were saying if you need to do it and

22

need to have local national preferences, come back to

23

the Senate for approval.

And I don’t think that the

24

language is superfluous.

In fact, the — if anything,

25

it reflects some wisdom because the executive has never

Can you think of any other

14

MR. MOTT:

Yes.

There are several, and I

think that that is an extremely salient point, because

21

That has never been done by this Court

That would be new law.
In Cherokee Tobacco there was an Internal

22

24

that said tobacco produced in the Cherokee nation would

not be taxed.

There was a treaty with the Cherokees

This Court said the act of Congress must

There was no evidence that Congress in

There was no reference

In Sanchez v. the United States in 1910 this

6
7

Court in the case of a Puerto Rican who claimed he had a

8

government quasi-public position, which was a property

9

right under the treaty with Spain and Puerto Rico, this

10

Court — what happened is the military governor

11

abolished the position, and then Congress passed the

12

Foraker Act preserving the law of Puerto Rico at that

13

time as modified by military decree.

14

was abolished by the -- and blessed by the Foraker Act.

15

And this Court held that the act of Congress in stating

16

the military order superseded the treaty with Spain, and

17

this Court commented on page 175 and 176, "Congress did

18

not intend by the" — "Even if Congress did not intend

19

by the Foraker Act to modify the treaty, if that act

20

were deemed inconsistent with the treaty, the act would

prevail."

22

So the position

The point is not that the intent be clearly

23

expressed to abrogate but only that there be clear

24

inconsistency.

25

Chan Ping v. United States in 1898, in Edye v. Robertson

And that is a similar position in Chae

point in all those cases, there was absolutely no intent

3

to abrogate evidence in the record of the act, and in

immaterial whether the departure from the treaty was

6

accidental or designed.

the statute prevails.

If it’s clearly inconsistent,

I think the point here is largely confused by

notion which applies to statutes, and we cited Professor

Henkin in our brief, and I think he more adequately

describes the relationship.

legislates without regard to international obligations.

If the clear effect of that legislation is inconsistent,

then for domestic law purposes the agreement has to be

10

Well, now, what is there in the

legislative history to say that in correcting the

QUESTION;

Is that the only recognition in the

history of the existence of agreements with countries?
MR. MOTT;

There's a second one by

23

implication, I think, and that is Senator Schweiker

24

pointed out that most civilian jobs in U.S.

25

installations in Europe are held by local nationals or

43

2

are classified as local national jobs, and American

3

dependents cannot fill the jobs because of their

cla ssification.

5

Now, the only thing —

6

QUESTION:

7

And you say that would be true only

under those agreements?
MR. MOTT:

8
9

These jobs

Right.

Because, for example, in

the Phipps example he did not reclassify the jobs as

10

local national; he simply said he wanted all European

11

Exchange System elements in months ahead to emphasize

12

recruitment of local nationals and de-emphasize

That is done by these

As the legislative history indicates, the

MR. MOTT;

8
9

That's right.

And I really hasten

to emphasize that nowhere has this Court ever required

10

specific intent to abrogate, and the case law is fairly

11

extensive and included in our brief.
QUESTION;

12

The --

Mr. Mott, did not the same Congress

13

that passed Section 106 use the same term "treaty" in

14

another act where it's been determined that they used it

15

in the broader sense?
MR. MOTT;

16

No.

I think to the contrary.

The

17

Court of Appeals relied on Senate Resolution 214 and on

18

the Case Act.

The Case Act.

MR. MOTT;

And in both those cases they used

it very specifically.

They said, in the Case Act,

Now, it's interesting that all these

1

under the Case Act, which by definition only applies to

2

things that aren’t treaties.

3

really right that the same 82nd Congress that set up the

4

Case Act requirement would consider these things to be

5

treaties, it wouldn’t have to file them under the Case

6

Act at all.

If the Government was

7

And the point is this elaborate distinction

8

between treaties and other international arrangements

9

only exists really for purposes of this case.

The

10

government’s own internal memos, the State Department

11

procedures on when you — how you conclude international

12

agreements, the very memos that talk about the policy on

13

preferential independent hiring always make the

14

distinction between treaties and other agreements and

15

always use treaties in the constitutional sense.
So when it comes time to defend an action

16
17

whereby nothing has ever been submitted as a treaty and

18

the exhortations of Congress, as the Government

19

characterized them, have been ignored, the notion of a

20

non-Article II treaty emerges in the Government’s

as an administrative construction.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — Rebuttal

12

MS. ETKIND;

The fact that the discrimination

Although — while it's true that the same 92nd

exactly to classify jobs as local nationals, because he

Also, with respect to the need — the point we

have made for a need for a showing of intent to

that the earlier must give way to the later; but whereas

look for an intent to abrogate, and in the absence of

together.

With respect to the Case Act provision and why
