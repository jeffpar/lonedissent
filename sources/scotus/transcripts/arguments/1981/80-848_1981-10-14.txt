CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

3 in Piper Aircraft against Reyno and the related case.

Mr.

4 Fitzsimons, I think you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. FITZSIMONS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, PIPER AIRCRAFT COMPANY

7

MR. FITZSIMONS:

Thank you.

Chief Justice Eurger,

8 and may it please the Court, the order which permits us to
9 come before this Court today restricts the appeal to the
10 sole question of whether a federal court action brought by a
11 non-resident foreign plaintiff against an American
12 defendant, whether in that type of action the plaintiff may
13 defeat a motion to dismiss brought on the ground of foreign
14 non-convenience merely by showing that the substantive law
15 that would be applied if the case were litigated in that
16 plaintiff’s own court would be different or less favorable
17 than it would be if it were tried here in America.
18

The factual background of this case is quite

19 significant.

In 1976 there was a small six-seat aircraft

20 that crashed into the mountains of Scotland.

It was on a

21 charter flight from England to Scotland, and the crash
22 resulted in the deaths of all six people onboard; five
23 passengers and the pilot.

All of these people were Scottish

24 citizens.
25

The aircraft had been owned, operated and

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 maintained for several years prior to the accident by
2 Scottish interests, and the pilot was employed by a Scottish
3 company.

The aircraft was registered with the British

4 authorities, and the pilot was licensed by the Scottish
5 authorities, and the accident was investigated by the
6 British Department of Trade.
7

The Department's proposed report was the subject

8 of an evidentiary hearing which was conducted by a review
9 board headed by Mr. and later Lord Jauncey, who was
10 assisted, again, by two technical advisors from Scotland.
11

Substantial documentary evidence went before this

12 hearing, and some 13 witnesses testified, most of whom were
13 technicians from Great Britian.
14

The hearing took place in Edinburgh, Scotland, and

15 as I say, it lasted for nine days.

In addition, Lord

16 Jauncey spent a day in Farnsborough, England, inspecting the
17 wreckage of the aircraft.

Presently, what remains of the

18 wreckage is still at Farnsborough.
19

As a result of the accident, a California

20 resident, Gaynell Reyno, has brought this action to recover
21 for the heirs and next of kin of the decedents, that is, the
22 passenger decedents, and her complaint alleges negligence
23 and also strict liability.
24

Although she sues as the personal representatives

25 of the estates of these passengers, she is in no way related

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to them.

At the time of bringing this action, all of the

2 heirs and survivors of the deceased passengers were
3 Scottish.

Gaynell Reyno was a resident of the state of

4 California, and a secretary in the office of the attorney
5 for the plaintiffs.
6

The only connection which the United States has

7 with this accident at all was the fact that some seven years
8 or so prior to the time that the accident occurred, the
9 aircraft had been manufactured in the United States by Piper
10 Aircraft Company, and at the time of its manufacture, it was
11 equipped with a propeller that was manufactured by Hartzell
12 in Ohio .
13

Almost immediately after its manufacture, the

14 aircraft was sold to an interest in Ohio, and by some chain
15 of events not known to defendants, found its way over to
16 Scotland .
17

On the motion of the defendants, the United States

18 District Court for the Biddle District of Pennsylvania
19 granted an order dismissing this action on the ground of
20 foreign non-convenience, and it conditioned that dismissal,
21 as courts generally do, on the defendants waiving any
22 statute of limitations defense they might have and agreeing
23 to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Scotland.
24

It might be well to point out here at this

25 particular time that these same plaintiffs have brought

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 actions in Scotland against the operating company, against
2 the owner of the aircraft (two Scottish interests), against
3 the pilot, pilot's estate, a Scottish interest, and indeed,
4 against the British Civil Aviation Authority.
5

And the pilot's estate himself has also started an

6 action over in Great Britain.
7

In the memorandum opinion which accompanied the

8 order, the district court considered the factors set forth
9 by this court in the seminal foreign non-convenience case of
10 Gulf Oil against Gilbert and its progeny.

And it concluded

11 that the defendants had shown overwhelming reasons for a
12 foreign non-convenience dismissal.

And that court also said

13 that it would be no less than an abuse of discretion on its
14 part if it did not dismiss on the ground of foreign
15 non-convenience, as the Gilbert criteria, quote,
16 "overwhelmingly point to dismissal."
17

The district court weighed all the private

18 interest factors set forth in Gilbert, and found that they
19 all clearly pointed to trial in Scotland.

The district

20 court also weighed the public interest factors laid down in
21 Gilbert, and similarly concluded that all of these, too,
22 favored the trial in Scotland.

And in considering these

23 public interests, the district court said that uppermost in
24 its mind was the fact that a trial could be complex and
25 confusing to a jury because it would have to apply the rule

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of law of Scotland to Hartzell and the rules of liability
2 law of Pennsylvania to Piper.
3

QUESTION:

4 more background.

Hr. Fitzsimons, let me get a little

This suit was instituted in California,

5 was it not?
6

HE. FITZSIHONS:

Was instituted in California and

7 sent to Pennsylvania on a 1404 transfer.
8

QUESTION:

9

HR. FITZSIHONS:

10 defendant Piper.

By whose motion?
By the motion of the defendant,

Hartzell, at that time, made a motion to

11 dismiss because it was not subject to the jurisdiction of
12 the court.
13

QUESTION*

Is your client a Pennsylvania

14 corporation ?
15

MR. FITZSIMONS*

They are a Delaware corporation,

16 I believe, Your Honor.
17

QUESTION*

Is Hartzell a Pennsylvania corporation?

18

MR. FITZSIMONS*

They are.

But the principal

19 place of business of Piper is in Pennsylvania, and that's
20 where this aircraft was manufactured.
21

QUESTION*

So that in effect, you accomplished one

22 transfer, and then sought a second.
23

MR. FITZSIMONS*

Yes, Your Honor, and I believe

24 that that was required because the court over in California
25 had no jurisdiction to pass upon the situation with respect

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to Hartzell whera jurisiictioa did not lie.

And the

2 district court found that this did not constitute any reason
3 why it should not be heard.
4

In any event, the circuit court also found that

5 the product liability law of Scotland would not apply to
6 Hartzell, but that indeed, the law of Pennsylvania would
7 apply to both.

And what the court said was this:

the court

8 held that if the case were transferred over to Scotland,
9 that the Scottish law would apply, and the plaintiffs would
10 lose their cause of action for strict liability and that
11 this was impermissible.
12

The Third Circuit cited DeMateos against Texaco,

13 Inc. as authority, and it held that a dismissal for foreign
14 non-convenience, like a statutory transfer under 1404(a),
15 should not, despite its convenience, result in a change in
16 the applicable law.
17

QUESTION:

Would you also say that in Scotland

18 there would be no trial by jury?
19

MR. FITZSIMONS:

I’m not certain that there would

20 not be a trial by jury in Scotland, Your Honor.

I know that

21 there would not be in England, but I'm not certain about
22 that subject in Scotland.
23

QUESTION:

Where do you — where is the critical

24 passage where you claim the court of appeals said that the
25 change of law would — is the crux of their decision?

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. FITZSIMONSs

Oh, they did not say in so many

2 words that it is the crux of their decision, but they
3 started right up front, Your Honor, by discussing the
4 question of law and what they said, in effect, was, that was
5 the only public factor that they considered, and then at the
6 end of their opinion they said, we don’t have to consider
7 any others.
8

And I refer the Court to A 139.

9

QUESTIONS

As I read the court of appeals opinion,

10 it started right out and reviewed all of the factors that
11 the district court had considered in dismissing, and
12 differed with the district court on every single factor.

Is

13 that right or not?
14

MR. FITZSIMONSs

Not the way I read the decision.

15 The way I read the —
16

QUESTIONS

You say you think that if they hadn't

17 thought what they did about the change of the law, that they
18 would have approved the dismissal?
19

MR. FITZSIMONSs

I believe that they should have,

20 Your Honor.
21
22 have?

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but you think they would

I thought they disagreed with the district court on

23 every single factor.
24

MR. FITZSIMONSs

Mr. Justice White, the way I read

25 that decision is that they considered three private factors;

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 convenience of witnesses, compulsory processes interpleader
2 and view of the premises.
3

QUESTION;

And then one public —

And found that none of them would

4 warrant the dismissal.
5

ME. FITZSIMONS;

That's right.

And then one

6 public — well, that's in view of the fact that there would
7 be the change of the law, Your Honor.

That's inherent in

8 the decision.
9

And on the public side, they just took the

10 applicable law only, just that one.

So they did not go

11 through every one that the district court had gone through.
12

In any event. Your Honor, the decision —

13

QUESTION;

14 did, frankly.

I had the same problem Justice White

I thought they were saying that the district

15 court was wrong in thinking the jury would be confused by
16 the foreign law and the differences in law, things of that
17 nature.
18

Rather than relying entirely on this point.
MB. FITZSIMONS;

The circuit court clearly held

19 that the law which would be applied to both defendants would
20 be the Pennsylvania law.
21

QUESTION;

I understand that.

22

NR. FITZSIMONS;

And the court did say in so many

23 terms, so many words rather, that you cannot have a
24 dismissal where that would work a change in the law.
25

QUESTION;

Where do they say that?

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

2

HR. FITZSIMONSs

Where is that?
They say that. Your Honor, and I

3 will show it to you, at — it's starting on
4 Appendix.

139 of the

"Even under the district court’s choice of law

5 analysis requiring a mixture of American and Scottish law,
6 it is apparent that the dismissal would work a change in the
7 applicable law so that the plaintiff’s strict liability
8 claim would be eliminated from the case.

But this Court has

9 held that a dismissal for foreign non-convenience, like a
10 statutory transfer, should not, despite its convenience,
11 result in a change of the applicable law.

Only when the

12 American law is not applicable or when that foreign
13 jurisdiction would, as a matter of its choice of law, give
14 the plaintiff the benefit of the claim to which she is
15 entitled here..." —
16

QUESTION:

But the court held that the district

17 court was wrong on this.

It says, "Even under the district

18 court’s choice of law analysis..."
19 what you said.

Then it went on to say

But the court of appeals said the district

20 court was quite wrong in its choice of law analysis.
21

QUESTION;

I understand that that's what the

22 circuit court says, but they nevertheless -23

QUESTION;

Well, they went ahead and nevertheless

24 said what you say, but what if they were right that it’s the
25 American law that governs here?

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. FITZSIMONS*

1

Your Honor, even if that were

2 true, the inequities that would be involved that the
3 district court did not treat with or treated with
4 improperly, certainly should have called for a dismissal.
5

QUESTION:

That may be so, but that's a different

6 point, that's a different point.

Where does the court of

7 appeals say that if there was a transfer or if there was a
8 dismissal, that the Scottish law would apply if the case
9 were tried in Scotland, even though under their analysis the
10 law of Pennsylvania would apply?
11

MR. FITZSIMONSs

Your Honor, I cannot point to

12 that exactly but I know that that was a finding on the part
13 of the district court where the district court said -14

QUESTION*

I know, but how about the court of

15 appeals —
16

MR. FITZSIMONS*

I don't think the circuit court

17 — let me see.
18

QUESTION*

19 would apply

Let's assume that the Scottish courts

the American law, like the court of appeals held

20 should be applicable.
21

MR. FITZSIMONS:

If Scotland would do that?

22

QUESTION*

Then there should be a transfer,

Yes.

23 there should be a dismissal, shouldn't there?
24
25 law.

MR. FITZSIMONSs

If they were going to apply that

In any event there should be, Your Honor, because the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 basic fairness of this rule the way it is right now is
2 briefly as follows.

It requires the Scottish plaintiff to

3 come over here to America to prosecute the case.

It

4 handicaps the defendant in that the defendant cannot add the
5 parties that it needs, the parties that the district court
6 found to be necessary parties to be impleaded, such as the
7 owner, the operator and the estate of the pilot.
8

Should the defendant, so handicapped, lose, it now

9 — an American defendant has to go all the way over to
10 Scotland.
11

QUESTION;

That's right# and —

12

HR. FITZSIMONS;

To press his action, and that is

13 just basically unfair. Your Honor.
14

QUESTION;

Well, the court of appeals didn't think

15 it was.
16

MR. FITZSIMONS;

Not in light of the fact that

17 their basis, that the Pennsylvania law — that there could
18 not be a change in the law, and I say that's the hingepin of
19 their decision.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

21

ORAL STATEMENT OF WARNER W. GARDNER, ESQ.

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, HARTZELL PROPELLER, INC.

23

MR. GARDNER;

Mr. Gardner?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

24 the Court, if I may continue where my Brother Fitzsimons
25 half left off in terms of the decision below, I believe it

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 should be pointed out first that the opinion of the court
2 below was very loosely structured.
3 follow.

It is difficult to

But if one reads what it said and reads as it

4 decided, it is comparatively clear.
5

It went first to the so-called private factors

6 discussed by the district court.

As to three of them, it

7 found the district court in error in relying upon them for
8 grounds for transfer.

It did not say that they were grounds

9 for retaining the case in Pennsylvania.

They had a weight

10 of zero.
11

One of them, the inability of the defendants to

12 implead those in Scotland, whom we believe were responsible
13 for the accident, the court said the district court erred in
14 assigning it great weight.

It was entitled to weight, the

15 court said, but not so much.
16

We're left then, on the private factors, with all

17 being given the weight of zero and one being given a lesser
18 weight but still weight toward dismissal.

We turn to the

19 public factors enumerated in the Gilbert case.
20 undertook to examine them all.

The court

It got, if I may say so,

21 bewitched by the intricacies of the choice of law problem,
22 and ended up with the belief that the Pennsylvania law could
23 be applied by the Pennsylvania court —
24

QUESTION!

Hr. Gardner, this may be as appropriate

25 a place as any for me to ask you questions on my mind in its

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 language from Gulf Oil Corporation v. Gilbert on page 508
2 where the court says, "Factors of public interest also have
3 a place in applying the doctrine.

Administrative

4 difficulties follow for courts where litigation is piled up
5 in congested centers instead of being handled at its
6 origin.

Jury duty is a burden that ought not be imposed

7 upon the people of a community which has no relation to the
8 litigation•”
9

Isn't foreign non-convenience not just a doctrine

10 to be fought out between the plaintiffs and the defendants,
11 but doesn't the federal judicial administration have a stake
12 in it?
13

MB. GARDNER:

It obviously has, sir.

The common

14 formulation, the shorthand formulation, for the many factors
15 enumerated by Justice Jackson is the convenience to parties
16 and the interests of justice.

All those factors, which you

17 have just enumerated, Your Honor, are a part of the complex
18 collection of factors that should be balanced.
19 forgotten by the Third Circuit.

All were

It reached the conclusion

20 that there would be an adverse change in law if the case
21 were filed in Scotland, and categorically said at pages 139
22 and 140 that that was sufficient to prevent grant of the
23 motion.
24

QUESTION:

Adverse to the plaintiff.

25

MR. GARDSER:

Adverse to the plaintiff.

At page

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 156 of the Joint Appendix, in its concluding paragraph, it
2 said, as the policy interests of Pennsylvania and Ohio, upon
3 which it relied to determine that Pennsylvania law would be
4 applied, point to trial here, all other factors will point
5 similarly.

In short, it considered none but the choice of

6 law problem.
7

The only place in the whole 38 pages below where

8 the decision is explained, is the one paragraph on 139 and
9 140.

After the review of private factors, just drifted off,

10 no conclusion was drawn.

As I've said, the only conclusion

11 that could be drawn from the private factors was a weak, in
12 the view of the court below, factor pointing toward
13 dismissal.
14

QUESTION*

Has that entirely clear?

Are there

15 processes -16

MR. GARDNER*

Nothing in this opinion is entirely

17 clear, sir.
18

QUESTION*

I’m just wondering in this body of law,

19 are there cases in which a manufacturer has been sued for
20 product defect in his home office where the product is
21 manufactured, where he has ever gotten dismissal on the
22 foreign non-convenience ground?
23

MR. GARDNER*

24

QUESTION*

25

MR. GARDNER*

Yes, sir.

There are not very many, are there?
There haven't been all that many

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 product liability cases.
2

QUESTION*

The

I could imagine this motion being made

3 by the defendants that could have been brought in Scotland,
4 on the ground that there are witnesses and relevant records
5 and so forth at the home office.
6

HE. GARDNER*

The difference between a suit in

7 Scotland and a suit in Pennsylvania is that in Scotland both
8 parties can try their case.

The defendant will, and has no

9 objection to having the dismissal so conditioned, transport
10 to Scotland all of its witnesses, all of its records if they
11 wish to try out product liability on an aircraft seven years
12 old.
13

QUESTION*

Well, the age of the case is partly

14 because it was originally filed in California and
15 transferred .
16

HR. GARDNER*

Hartzell was not sued in California,

17 were not served properly.
18

The defendants cannot try out negligence of the

19 air taxi, of the pilot, of the owner and maintenance in the
20 United Kingdom and in Scotland.
21

QUESTION:

Is that all a defense if the product

22 was defective?
23

HR. GARDNER*

We can assume so, I believe, that if

24 the product were defective, it surely was joined, or such is
25 our position, by negligence on the part of those who were

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 maintaining and operating the aircraft.

We cannot assume

2 and say therefore, the defendants cannot try their case,
3 that there was no negligence.

And we cannot try our case

4 without the compulsory process.

None of the Scottish

5 witnesses would willingly testify.

Well, certainly you didn't expressly

MR. GARDNER*

It's discussed in our brief.

In the

If we wish to.

I don't know that we

15 particularly wish to.

MR. GARDNER*

In that case,

Well, let me ask

it's not here.
— if it isn't here,

in saying that if the case were tried in America

If we

21 judge it on

that basis, then what evidence is there, or —

22 I'll put it

this way.

Are you in agreement, or all

the

23 parties in agreement that if the case shifted to Scotland
24 that the American law would not apply?
25

MR. GARDNER*

That is my belief, sir.

Yes, I qualified my answer.

But your view is that the courts

11
12 points

MR. GARDNER;

We agree — that's one of the few

in those 38 pages that we agree with .

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. GARDNER:

The --

And where do they say that?
At page 137, 139 and 147.

The

15 discussion is not connected; these are isolated sentences.
16 But you will find between those three references the
17 statement that the Scottish courts would apply lex loci
18 delicto to choose the law and that under Scottish law there
19 would be no strict liability, but rather negligence.
20

QUESTION:

I think everybody agrees with that, but

21 the question is whether they would apply the Scottish law.
22

MR. GARDNER:

I go back, then, to the earlier

23 statement that the Court said, I believe correctly, that the
24 Scottish courts apply the doctrine lex loci delicto, would
25 apply the law of the place of the accident, and if they're

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 like any court, if they were captured to apply another law,
2 they would look at the place of residence of the plaintiffs
3 and find that, too, to be Scotland.

There is no possible

4 doubt —
5

QUESTION*

Not like any other court because the

6 court of appeals of the third circuit doesn't do that.

HR. GARDNER*

I will amend my statement, sir, to

All except the court of appeals of the

10 third circuit.
11

MR. GARDNER*

Like most courts is perhaps the

12 kindest way to phrase it.
13

QUESTION*

I don't find the statement of the court

14 of appeals that you referred to very categorically, Mr.
15 Gardner.
16

MR. GARDNER:

It's not categorical, sir, but if

17 you've read those three sentences —
18

QUESTION:

Well, I have to read three pages first

19 before I find the sentences.

I wonder if I may help.

20

MR. GARDNER::

21

QUESTION*

You may.

22

QUESTION*

One particular sentence, if you’ll take

23 page 137 and help us focus on that.
24

MR. GARDNER:

I read it and —

Start at the beginning of the

25 paragraph on the bottom which states that under the

1 applicable choice of law rules, the American or Scottish law
2 would apply.
3

QUESTION;

Well, but they're reciting the

4 arguments rather than stating their view.

At least, so it

5 seems to me, although somewhat ambiguous.
6

HR. GARDNER:

If you look, at page 139, I must have

7 thrown in 137 as the introductory part of it.

Page 139, the

8 beginning of the last paragraph is reasonably categorical,
9 relating the affidavit of Scottish counsel, to the effect
10 that the Scottish —
11

QUESTION;

You take it as a conclusion of the

12 court beginning, "And therefore, Scotland probably would
13 apply its own law to all claims."

You suggest we read that

14 as their holding.
15

MR. GARDNER;

I think so.

When you come to page

16 147, which is my third reference, you'll find that the court
17 assumes that there would be a conflict between American
18 strict liability and the Scottish negligence law if it had
19 not been for its application of the so-called governmental
20 interests.
21

I have not been able to remove my feet from the

22 quagmire of the decision below, and I would like to save a
23 few minutes for rebuttal, if the Court permits, I will save
24 my remaining time for rebuttal.

I refer the Court, please,

25 to our briefs for our position on the law.

6

QUESTION*

I take it you don’t have the same

7 difficulties that your friends have with understanding this
8 opinion,ft
9

MR. CATHCART:

No, sir, I find it to be a very.

10 very fine and well-written and well-reasoned opinon.
11

QUESTION:

I'm sure.

12

(General laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

Fine.

But let’s address the clarity of

14 it, and tell us where they hold what you say they hold.
15

MR. CATHCART:

I say they hold that when applying

16 the factors of Gulf Oil versus Gilbert, which have been
17 applied since 1947 in cases of this nature, they have no
18 trouble finding an abuse of discretion on the part of the
19 district court judge, and this carefully-written opinion
20 examines each one of those factors and makes it very clear
21 that the case turns on an abuse of discretion; it does not
22 turn on the question of foreign law.
23

If we look at page 4 of the decision, — I’m sorry

24 I don’t have it referenced as to the index which accompanied
25 our briefs.

But the court language on page 4 makes it very

QUESTION:

You claim it begins at page 118 of the

That's where the opinion begins?
MB. CATHCABT:

It's just a little bit farther into

15 the opinion, if I can find the exact language wherein the
16 court indicated that the trial judge abused his discretion
17 in dismissing the action.

And the court went on to say, in

18 quotes, "Subsidiary but arguably crucial to this second
19 point is the claim...” —

I wish I knew where you are reading.

21

MB. CATHCART:

All right, let me see if I can

22 quickly find that for you in the appendix.

24

QUESTION:

QUESTION*

That's just reciting what the claim

That's just a contention.

5

NR. CATHCARTs

That is correct.

There is, I

QUESTIONS

Maybe the subsidiary sentence is not

10

MR. CATHCARTs

It's hard to tell.
It is on page A-120 of the decision

11 in the second complete paragraph.
12

QUESTIONS

Starting,

"In this court, Reyno raises

13 two major contentions..."?
14

MR. CATHCARTs

Yes, sir, that is where I find it.

15 And those are —
16

QUESTIONS

17 it doesn't describe

18

That merely describes the contentions
the holding.

MR. CATHCARTs

Yes, sir, that is correct.

Eut the

19 holding of the court, as we go through the decision, was
20 based upon a careful examination of every one of the Gulf
21 Oil v. Gilbert factors and a weighing of these in concluding
22 that we have in this case an abuse of discretion on the part
23 of the district court judge.

And based upon that, the case

24 turned .
25

Now, the court went on to indicate that where

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 American law applies, a forum non-convenience dismissal
2 should not be granted.

And in that instance, in looking

3 through the cases cited by the petitioners here, —
4

QUESTION:

Well, on page 131 it says, "The

5 standard of review is one of abuse of discretion, but if the
6 trial court has not held the defendants to their proper
7 burden or has clearly erred in weighing the factors, the
8 equivalent of an abuse of discretion has been demonstrated.
9 Discretion must be exercised within the applicable
10 standards.”

And then the court goes on to the applicable

11 factors and disagrees with the district court.
12

MR. CATHCART*

13

QUESTIONS

That is correct in every instance.

What law do you say applies to the

14 claims of the negligence of the pilot?
15

MR. CATHCART;

The law as to the negligence of the

16 pilot may very well be governed by Scottish law, but the
17 negligence of the pilot in a products liability action is
18 not a defense.

And therefore, we may not need to have the

19 trier of the fact judge by any standard his negligence.

The

20 plaintiff in this case has the burden of proof under the
21 law, the domestic American law of products liability, of
22 establishing fault, either under restor or sui statement of
23 tort 2nd 402 2nd, or under a variation thereof.
24

QUESTION;

How old was this aircraft?

25

MR. CATHCART:

The aircraft was several years

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 old.

I can't tell the Court exactly how old it is, but I

2 believe five or six years old.
3

QUESTION;

Six years old.

4

ME. CATHCART:

But the distinction I’d like to

5 draw for you, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this is a design
6 defect case.

The plaintiffs are alleging that the design of

7 the aircraft was a proximate cause of the accident, and that
8 that design was defective.

So we're going beyond attacking

9 one item; that is, that there was a defect in the
10 manufacture.
11

QUESTION;

Is there anything in this record that

12 shows how many air hours were logged in this aircraft?
13

MR. CATHCART:

There is nothing in the record as

14 of this moment because we have been dealing with procedural
15 matters and not with discovery matters.
16

QUESTION;

I see.

I raise that because whether

17 this is or would turn out to be a product liability case or
18 a negligence case in terms of the pilot error, is not very
19 clear now, is it?
20

MR. CATHCART;

It's clear what our burden must be

21 in order to prevail against the manufacturer, since we
22 represent the estates of passengers onboard the airplane.
23

QUESTION:

What's the connection of Reyno with the

24 passengers onboard the airplane?
25

MR. CATHCART:

Gaynell Reyno is the nominal party

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 plaintiff who was appointed by the Los Angeles County
2 Superior Court as personal representative of the estate.
3 She, at the time, was a secretary within my law firm and she
4 is not a real party in interest.

She was appointed because

5 under California procedural law, an action for wrongful
6 death can be brought in the names of the heirs; it also can
7 be brought on behalf of the heirs by the personal
8 representative of an estate.
9

Since we do have choice of law issues here as to

10 what wrongful death statute does apply, or at least had to
11 at the time that this case began, we had to choose or elect
12 in which form to bring the action.
13

QUESTION;

But don’t you run up there, when you

14 get into the federal court, that there are public factors
15 involved, too, where perhaps the federal courts could be
16 better utilized for matters of more directly federal concern
17 than a secretary in a law office acting as the executor for
18 parties in a private damage action.
19

MR. CATHCART:

She certainly is only a nominal

20 plaintiff, and therefore, her interest is only that of
21 occupying a title in discharging a court-appointed
22 responsibility.

But the real parties in interest are people

23 who have lost their breadwinners, and it's a matter which

24 should be of great concern to a federal court, and this case

5

HR. CATHCARTs

They're all in Scotland.

And they could sue in Scotland.
They could sue in Scotland.

They

6 may or may not get jurisdiction, but the defendants, as they
7 typically do in cases of this nature, have agreed to waive
8 statutes of limitations and to make themselves subject to
9 the jurisdiction of a foreign court because of the obvious
10 advantages which inure to them under different law,
11 different standards and lack of a trial by jury.

And

12 there's no question, one of the attractive features besides
13 the location of a substantial quantum of proof as to a
14 design defect being right at the manufacturer's place of
15 business is the fact that, I still believe and I think my
16 clients belief, our system of justice is without equal in
17 our system of determining what is just and adequate
18 compensation for real losses.

QUESTION;

to —

Wouldn't that apply to a toy cart in

13 Russia if it was made in the United States?
14

MR. CATHCART:

It might, if we went through all

15 the Gulf Oil v. Gilbert factors and concluded

that this was

16 an appropriate place to sue, and that the defendant, under
17 the facts situation, did not meet its burden.

I'm certainly

18 not trying to ask this Court, as I believe the petitioners
19 are, to come up with new law, a new doctrine, that aliens
20 should not be allowed to bring actions for products
21 liability in this country.

22

And I think that's the way -- even though the

23 issue was guite limited under which certiorari was granted,
24 the briefs have been expanded to encourage this Court to
25 make such a finding.

I don't believe we should close the

MR. CATHCART:

Would, wouldn’t they?

Well, if we read DeMateos and the

But if we look at DeMateos, we see a case which had

15 no American connection whatsoever that was of significance.

But here we have a case in which it is

17 not yet clear whether it's pilot error or negligence of the

QUESTION:

You don’t want to take that risk.

6

MR. CATHCART:

I don't want to take that risk at

7 this stage of the proceedings when it was not raised that
8 strongly in the lower court.

Me have another factor in this

9 case, because as I understand the limited issue, we're
10 talking about whether it can be denied merely because
11 foreign law will apply.

And I submit, and it is the

12 position of the respondents, that it is merely an element
13 that must be considered and should be considered.
14

But we go to another factor which I think is a

15 very important factor in this case, and that is the
16 defendant in this case has moved this case already, and
17 moved this case upon the representation to the courts
18 involved by way of affidavits that Pennsylvania is
19 overwhelmingly fair to all parties.

In addition, by way of

20 affidavit. Piper has said in the affidavit of November 22,
21 1977, judicial temporaral and geographical interests are
22 best served by a transfer to Pennsylvania, though propriety
23 of transferring the within action to Pennsylvania for the
24 convenience of witnesses overwhelms other factors.

I think you started to say if you

10 did, they'd transfer it to the federal court which would
11 then dismiss it.
12

BE. CATHCART*

The federal court, unless guided by

13 the Third Circuit opinion, which hopefully will remain the
14 law of this case, would have to leave the case, I assume,
15 intact here on the basis that certainly, it's an important
16 element here under Gulf Oil, that the very wrong of which
17 the plaintiffs complain, the defective design of the
18 airplane, took place in Pennsylvania right at the place
19 where this trial is going to be held.

And presumably, the

20 manufacturer and all of his employees and people who were
21 instrumental are located there, as is a substantial amount
22 of proof concerning the manufacturing process, the role of
23 the Federal Aviation Administration in that process, and so
24 on.
25

QUESTION:

Are you so sure that the state action

36

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in Pennsylvania would automatically be removable?

One of

2 your defendants has principal place of business in
3 Pennsylvania, I was told.
4

ME. CATHCARTi

Yes, Piper does have a principal

5 place of business in — we have a principal place of
6 business in Pennsylvania, and also in the state of Florida.
7 And although I believe them to be nominally a Delaware
8 corporation, —
9

QUESTION!

Well, is there diversity?

Oh, you're a

10 California plaintiff, aren't you?
11

MR. CATHCARTs

12

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.

For Scottish people.

There may still be no diversity in view

13 of the principal place of business.
14

One last question.

Do I understand an action is

15 pending in the courts of Scotland?
16

MR. CATHCARTi

Yes, there is an action pending not

17 against the manufacturers, but there is an action pending in
18 the courts of Scotland, which was filed after the procedural
19 issues arose as to whether these people would be allowed to
20 go forward or would not be allowed to go forward in the
21 United States of America.
22

QUESTION;

You said not against the manufacturer.

23 Against whom, then?
24

MR. CATHCART:

It would be against the operator of

25 the aircraft, the owner and perhaps against the deceased

37

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 pilot’s estate.
2

On that I do not know for sure.

What we have here, or what is solicited by the

3 defendants in this case as manufacturers, and urged by major
4 airplane manufacturers in their amicus curiae briefs is an
5 effort to cause this Court to adopt a policy to close the
6 door in products liability cases on accidents which involve
7 products defectively made in the United States but which are
8 sold abroad, and which the manufacturer can be expected to
9 be involved in accidents in anyplace of the globe because of
10 the ubiquitous nature of aircraft, and large aircraft in
11 particular.

And the law of the United States has not gone

12 that far.
13

As a matter of fact, the law of the United States

14 so far has, where there is a U.S. connection and a reason
15 particularly to apply American law, the courts of the United
16 States have been open to the victims of aviation accidents
17 around the world.

And in a design case, it's particularly

18 important that they be open because design involves not just
19 one defective article, but involves perhaps a fleet of
20 articles; articles operating in this country and elsewhere
21 in which the United States has a significant interest.

38

1

We have, then, the manufacturers trying to use a

2 procedural rule to bring about a substantive result, a
3 procedural rule which would under given circumstances deny
4 causes of action and deny in some circumstances the right of
5 recovery against U. S. manufacturers for defectively made
6 products here.
7

That, in my opinion, is a policy which should not

8 be encouraged and should not be sanctioned by the highest
9 Court of this land.

The dismissal process should not be

10 used as a protective shield to determine the outcome of
11 litigation, but to the contrary, it should be used only when
12 there is no real nexus to the United States of America and
13 no conceivable basis upon which the manufacturer could play
14 a role in — the U. S. base manufacturer could play a role
15 in the manufacturing process.
16

I think our position is that based on the limited

17 issue to which certiorari has been granted, that no matter
18 how this Court decides that issue, it should not be
19 determinative or result in a reversal of the Third Circuit
20 Court opinion, because of the very detailed and elaborate
21 weighing of all of the Gulf Oil versus Gilbert factors, and
22 as urged in our brief, because the decision clearly, from
23 the depth of that decision and the detail in the decision in
24 examining those factors, the decision turns not on foreign
25 law or whether it does or does not apply, although it was a

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 significant factor by the Court.
2

It is clear that all of the other Gulf Oil versus

3 Gilbert factors also were found by the Appellate Court to
4 cause this court, the Appellate Court to believe that there
5 was an abuse of discretion by the trial judge and a failure
6 to meet the burden of proof which the forum non-convenience
7 cases impose upon a moving party, and there was no evidence
8 presented which shows that suing a manufacturer in his own
9 back yard, where the alleged wrongful conduct was conducted,
10 is somehow vexing or harassing a —
11

QUESTION;

May I ask, do you interpret our limited

12 grant as indicating that this Court has already read the
13 Court of Appeals opinion to have turned exclusively on the
14 possibility that the law might change if the case were
15 dismissed?
16

MR. CATHCARTs

I don't read it on that alone.

I

17 read it —
18

QUESTION;

Well, we limited the grant to this

19 single question, didn't we?
20

MR. CATHCARTs

Yes, it was limited to a single

21 question when many others were raised, and that is why,
22 although the Petitioners have sought a review of this Court
23 ab initio, whether the Third Circuit acted properly or did
24 not act properly on all issues, the granting of the writ,
25 which is limited to the issue of must a motion to dismiss on

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 grounds of forum non-convenience be denied whenever the law
2 of the alternate forum is less favorable to recovery than
3 that which would be applied by the District Court, if we
4 answered that question yes or no, because of the word
5 "whenever" or as used by counsel in argument and in their
6 briefs, merely by showing, we are not expanding this to be a
7 broad issue —
8

QUESTION*

Well, part of your argument, I take it,

9 is that even if the law weren't going to change, that the
10 Court of Appeals nevertheless found no basis for the
11 transfer.
12

HR. CATHCART*

That is correct.

Even if foreign

13 law were to be applied, and because we are applying in
14 1404(A) transfers, foreign law frequently, when we take the
15 conflict of laws principles involved, and it may require the
16 use of foreign law, i. e., the law of a foreign state, in
17 deciding a case, and according to Van Dusen versus Barrack,
18 the law of the transferor state accompanies the transfer of
19 the file, including its conflict of laws, and accordingly a
20 transferee court can apply a foreign law, albeit a foreign
21 state, but there is no distinction of any great significance
22 to whether or not it is foreign state or foreign country.
23

QUESTION*

Yes, but the Third Circuit seems to

24 have said unequivocally that if there is a difference,
25 dismissal would not be justified.

They say that at Page 140.

MR. CATHCART;

It certainly did, and it adopted

2 its own language out of DeMateos, but if we -3

QUESTION:

And that is apparently the rule that

4 they apply in the Third Circuit, so that if we do not agree
5 with that rule, don't we have a duty to vacate the judgment
6 and say, take a look at the case without the benefit of that
7 rule?
8

MR. CATHCART:

I don’t believe so, because I don't

9 think the decision in that lower court turned on that one
10 statement.

It turned on a myriad of factors, and that one

11 statement, although important and of significance, was not
12 determinative.

It was not determinative in De Mateos,

13 because in De Mateos the court found that there was no nexus
14 to American law whatsoever, and therefore the Court did not
15 have to answer that question.

It said, this case does not

16 belong in the United States under the factual context.

It

17 is all foreign.
18

QUESTION:

Do you think that statement is a

19 correct statement of the law?
20

MR. CATHCART:

I think that it is a correct

21 statement to say -22

QUESTION:

You defend that rationale.

23

MR. CATHCART:

24

QUESTION:

I defend that rationale.

You really haven't.

You have pretty

25 much argued, well, they really didn't mean what they said.

1

MB. CATHCART*

I don't believe that it needs to

2 extend that far to justify the opinion of the Third
3 Circuit.

The opinion can stand even if this Court should

4 disagree with that statement.

I do not find that statement

5 in any opinions other than those by the Third Circuit and by
6 some of the text writers on the subject, who have suggested
7 strongly that the — as in the Fifth Circuit, in the Fisher
8 versus Ajios Hicolaos V, 628 F 2nd, 308, which is cited in
9 our brief, that says where U. S. law is applicable,
10 jurisdiction is retained, and I think, that is one side of
11 the coin, but what do we do if U. S. law is not applicable,
12 and that is something that is not before us at this time.

AFTERNOON SESSION
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Gardner, we have a

3 pretty narrow question here, and we hope for some
4 enlightenment on that narrow question.
5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARNER W. GARDNER, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — rebuttal

7

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, sir.

I have two minutes and 56

8 seconds in which I hope to maJte six categorical propositions
9 which I hope further will add some enlightenment to this
10 narrow question.
11

One, I was not able to answer the question of

12 Justice Stevens as to product liability cases.

At Page 9 of

13 our reply brief, we list seven or eight product liability
14 cases dismissed for forum non-convenience.

Two others cited

15 in our briefs — I will not give the citations here — are
16 the Michell and the Harrison cases.
17

The case of Canada Malting was mentioned here.

We

18 are of the view there is no way the court below can be
19 affirmed without overruling Canada Malting, which very
20 clearly dismissed a case despite seriously adverse changes
21 in the law.

I don't wish to resume my quarrel with the

22 court below, but in 38 pages they never mentioned Canada
23 Malting.
24

Mr. Cathcart explained correctly that the suit in

25 Scotland does not — was not brought against the

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 manufacturers.

His statement should be supplemented by the

2 fact that in the United Kingdom there is a suit brought by
3 the Pyrex estate against the American manufacturers over
4 whom jurisdiction has been asserted.
5

The estoppel point, which has figured here and

6 there because of statements made in the District Court of
7 California, decided adversely to the Respondent by two
8 courts below.

There was no petition for certiorari based

9 upon that nor any statement in the brief in opposition
10 relying upon it.

We think it is a little late to bring it

11 up at this point.
12

What to me was a critical sentence in the opinion

13 of the Court below lay just one sentence beyond the extracts
14 which Justice White read from Page 131.

The last sentence

15 of the paragraph on that page is, "The District Court's wide
16 discretion may not serve the defendants as a burden-shifting
17 device on appeal from an order in their favor."

In short,

18 discretion of the District Court is given great weight if it
19 be exercised in favor of the plaintiff, not otherwise.
20

The last and brief sentence is that the statements

21 that the court below considered all factors under Gilbert is
22 flatly wrong.

If you read the public factors enumerated by

23 the District Court, you will find them ignored by the Court
24 of Appeals, except for the one factor which is categorically
25 described on Page 139.
