ORAL ARGUMENT OF TED D. AYRES, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

6

MR. AYRES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

7 the Court, as the Court knows, the case at bar presents
8 issues which revolve around the religion clause of the First
9 Amendment to the United States Constitution and the
10 re-occurring question of its proper relationship with public
11 education.
12

QUESTION:

Just the religion clauses of the First

13 Amendment?
14

MR. AYRES:

It's our contention that it does. Your

15 Honor.
16

QUESTION:

How about the First Amendment itself,

17 apart from the religion clauses?

18

MR. AYRES:

Mr. Chief Justice, that is an argument

19 that has been made by the respondents in this case.
20 Hopefully, we will show in our argument to come that the
21 free speech clause, the press and the assembly clause which
22 were used by the Eighth Circuit were not properly used, and
23 that the case should center around the religion clauses.

24

QUESTION:

You concede, I take it, for purposes of

25 argument that the entire First Amendment applies with equal

1

force to the states as to the federal government.

2

HR. AYRES:

Yes, Your Honor, that's no problem.

3

We're dealing in this case with a tax-supported

4 state institution of higher education.

Generally, the

5 question can be summarized or posed as follows:
6 a

Can or must

tax-supported state university permit regular religious

7 worship services on its premises by a recognized student
8 group ?

9

The respondents in this case are members of a

10 group or organization called Cornerstone.
11

Cornerstone is

and was a recognized student group of the University of

12 Missouri, Kansas City.

13

In January of 1977, respondents sought to obtain

14 the usage of a campus building for meetings on every
15 Saturday night for two and a half hours for the following
16 winter semester, which ran from January to May.

Upon

17 further inquiry by university officials, information was
18 provided that indicated that respondents fully intended to
19 conduct regular religious worship services in the meeting
20 rooms that were sought.
21

The university was advised that a typical —

22

QUESTION:

Would you give me the dates for which

23 they sought.
24

MR. AYRES:

Justice Blackmun, the dates sought

25 which led to this case were from January through May of 1977.
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTIONS

And prior to that time, had the group

2 met on campus?
3

MR. AYRESs

Your Honor, the facts that were

4 stipulated at the trial indicated that the Cornerstone group
5 had met in university facilities prior to this time.
6 However, it was also stipulated that neither the Chancellor
7 nor the Dean of Students was ever aware that the Cornerstone
8 group was using the facilities for actual religious worship
9 services .
10

QUESTIONS

By facilities you mean indoors or

11 outside ?
12

MR. AYRESs

Up to this point in time, Justice

l3Blackmun, to my knowledge, the only usage that the
14 respondents made of university facilities was indeed indoors.
15

The university was advised that the typical

16 Cornerstone meeting that was sought would include the
17 following elements.

The offering of prayer, the singing of

18 hymns in praise and thanksgiving, the public reading of
19 Scripture, the sharing of personal views and experiences in
20 relation to God by various persons, an exposition of and

21 commentary on passages of the Bible by one or more persons
22 for the purposes of teaching practical Biblical principles,
23 and an invitation to the interested to meet for personal

24 discussions.
25

QUESTI0N«

The university system in Missouri has
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 recognized the right of a gay rights unit, as I understand
2 to meet on the campus and hold discussions and exchange
3 views, has it not?
4

MR. AYRESs

That is true. Justice Rehnguist.

But

51 would submit in response to that question -- and it’s
6 petitioners * position — that there is no constitutional
7 prohibition with regard to that incident as there is with
8 regard to religious worship.
9

QUESTION:

How about the Young Marxists League, if

10 they had one on the campus, would they be permitted to meet
11 to make attacks on the Democratic system of government and
12 express their views?
13

MR. AYRESs

Mr. Chief Justice, I would assume that

14 unless the meetings were such to advocate the immediate
15 overthrow of the government and were such that would lead to
16 imminent action, it’s my belief that those such meetings
17 would be permitted on campus.
18

QUESTIONS

So it’s only religious groups that may

19 properly be forbidden to meet on campus, in your view.

20

MR. AYRESs

Justice Rehnquist, let me make it

21 clear from the beginning that religious groups -- in this
22 case at the University of Missouri, Kansas City -- has ten
23 student groups that are recognized, official student groups,

24 which could be said to have some sort of a religious
25 affiliation.

There is no general prohibition against their
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 meeting on campus.

They are free to use the meeting rooms

2 and facilities of the university.

Official student

3 recognition also holds with it the possibility of funds to
4 help support or fund a speaker or a meeting.
5

They’re equally entitled to those benefits, as all

6 other officially recognized student groups are, except to
7 the extent of religious worship or religious teaching.

And

8 it is the position of petitioners that those sort of
9 activities are prohibited not only by the First Amendment of
10 the United States Constitution, but Missouri's constitution.
11

QUESTION*

Well, would you elaborate on the

12 distinction you make between the ten religious groups which
13 are recognized to meet and religious worship or services?
14

MR. AYRESi

Justice Rehnquist, I think we need to

15 keep the case centered around the facts of this particular
16case.

It appears to me, and it is petitioners' argument,

17 that under the facts of this case there is no question, and
18 it's undisputed in the record -- it was so found by the

19 trial court and it's admitted by the respondents — that
20 they seek to use university facilities for religious worship

21 services on a regular basis.
22

I would submit that as long as the meetings which

23 they wish to seek are with regard to speakers, a meeting of
24 the group for business purposes, that sort of thing, that is
25 not within the purview of the Constitution of prohibition.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 But it is the position of petitioners in

this case that the

2 facts that were presented to the university left us with no
3 choice but to prohibit the regular religious worship
4 services that were sought.

QUESTION:

5

Could they sign up Jerry Falwell for

6 once a month for a regular appearance on the campus?

MR. AYRES*

7

Without further clarification from

8 this Court and based upon prior decisions of
9 would

this Court, I

say the fact that -- if Mr. Falwell comes in on a

10 regular basis,
11 content

let's say a monthly basis, depending upon the

of his presentation or his speech, in my mind there

12 would be serious constitutional
13 to come in on a

regular basis.

QUESTION*

14

questions about allowing him

How about someone like William Kuntzler

15 or someone who had defended

one of the groups in the late

16 sixties?
17

MR. AYRES*

Although that individual might be

18 considered by some to be controversial,
19 touching on

the religious aspect.

I do not see that

Again, there's no intent

20 to restrict the freedom of speech of the students or anyone
21 else properly on the campus.

The question is whether or not

22 the campus may be used for religious worship services.
23 not

I do

think that your example with regard to Mr. Kuntzler

24 would fall into that category.
25

QUESTION*

But isn't reading from the Bible a form
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of freedom of speech?
2

MR. AYRES:

Justice Rehnauist, again, and relying

3 on prior decisions of the Court, this Court has said in the
4 Schempp case and others that the Bible is clearly an
5 instrument of religion.

But the university would not

6 contend or not argue that the Bible may not — or may also
7 be considered a work of literature and may be studied for
8 those purposes.
9

If someone were to read the Bible on campus

10 individually as a part of their study, it seems to me that
11 this regulation does not address that.

But to say that to

12 read the Bible in the context of the facts that we have in
13 this case, to me stretches freedom of speech or freedom of
14 assembly, stretches it way too far.
15

QUESTION*

Well, what if the program consisted of

16a reading of, say, four chapters of one of the gospels,
17 followed by a student discussion of the content of those
18 chapter and criticism and exchange and so forth?

19

MR. AYRES*

Based on that hypothetical, Justice

20Rehnquist, it would be my assumption that such activity

21 would not be prohibited under this regulation, or it does
22 not fall within the facts of the case now before the Court.

23

QUESTION*

In one of the hypotheticals presented

24 you said it would depend upon the content of what the
25 speaker said.

Do you not run afoul the free speech
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 provisions of the First Amendment/ entirely apart from the
2 religion clauses, if you censor on the basis of content?
3

MR. AYRESs

Hr. Chief Justice, I am aware of this

4 Court's opinion in Mosley and others, which indicates that
5 content-related restriction is violative of constitutional
6 law.

And I guess that's one of the reasons that we are

7 before this Court; is whether or not that prohibition
8 carries over into the religious area.
9

Hy argument would be, Mr. Chief Justice, that if

10 such an argument is allowed to prevail, in other words, if
11 someone could come in and say, I am here to speak about
12 religion, or, I am here to assemble about religion, and that
13 is a convenient excuse to allow religious worship services,
14 then it is my contention that that makes a complete nullity
15 of the establishment clause.
16

I do not think it's that easy, Mr. Chief Justice,

17 to allow that to -- allow the freedom of speech or freedom
18 of assembly clauses to come in in a case of this nature.

It

19 Just goes too far, and I realize that that presents some
20 tough or difficult questions, but looking at the history of

21 the establishment clause and what this Court has said it
22 means beginning in 1947 with Justice Black's famous opinion
23 in the Everson case, I just — my opinion would be that if
24 the Court holds that activities such as these are permitted
25 because of the speech clause or the assembly clause, the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Court will be making a drastic retrenchment from its prior
2 cases.
3

QUESTION*

How do you distinguish what the Court

4 has said was appropriate in terms of providing books to
5 parochial schools and transportation to and from parochial
6 schools, and that is certainly -- the arguments were made
7 that that was an aid of sorts to religion and also tax

8 exemption.
9

Isn't that —
MR. AYRES*

I do not think those cases are

10 applicable in this case, Mr. Chief Justice.

Obviously, the

11 immediate distinction is — and which the Court has made
12 many times itself -- is that the benefits provided in those
13 cases, for instance, the bus transportation case and the
14 textbook cases, was an indirect aid and went primarily to
15 the students involved and not to the parochial or private
16 school which was involved.

17

It's my opinion that in this case it can be

18 distinguished because here we have direct assistance that

19 will serve to have the primary effect of advancing

20 religion.

I draw the distinction that it is a more direct

21 benefit that is being provided than in the cases which Mr.
22 Chief Justice has discussed.

23

QUESTION *

What do you do with the provision of

24 religious services in the military and the Navy and so forth ?
25

MR. AYRES*

Justice Stevens, I would address that
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 question by the fact that this Court has spoken often of the
2 fact that if an individual is deprived of religious worship
3 opportunities by something that the government has done;
4i.e., a soldier in the field, a prisoner —
5

QUESTION*

6

MR. AYRES;

7 your question.

How about a church at Annapolis?
A prisoner in prison -- let me address

I think the Court has often held that that

8 would be hostile to religion to not permit the opportunity
9 for those individuals to worship just because of the fact
10 that they have been deprived of their other
11 already-immediate access to such services.
12

QUESTION;

Well, what if the campus is out in the

13 middle of the desert or something like that?
14

MR. AYRES;

To answer your question about

15 Annapolis, I would submit, Justice Stevens, that the
16 military academies, including Annapolis, are special
17 institutions, provided to train our military officers.

And

18 I would submit that the required Chapel at those
19 institutions are part of the training which go into —

20

QUESTION;

Well, it's voluntary, I assume.

21 Attendance is voluntary, as it is in this -- I take it here,
22 also, the student participation is entirely voluntary.
23

MR. AYRES;

24

QUESTION;

That's correct.
And the university doesn't either favor

25 or disfavor the group.

HP. AYRES:

2

QUESTION:

No
Mr. Ayres, the university draws no

3 distinction between religious services in buildings and on
4 its grounds, does it?
5

MR. AYRES:

Justice Powell, that is a question

6 that will be before the Court.

The trial court found that

7 the only question before it, based upon the pleadings, was
8 the issue of whether or not it could be permitted in a
9 university building.

The Eighth Circuit went and said that

10 they could address the issue of whether or not worship
11 services on the grounds were also emanating out of this
12 complaint.
13

I would submit to the Court and to Justice Powell

14 that the regulation involved on its face and in its own
15 language is applicable to buildings and grounds, and I think
16for
17

QUESTION:

18

MR. AYRES:

Your petition covers both.
Right.

And I think for purposes of

19 this case, they are questions that need to be answered.

We

QUESTION:

4

MR. AYRES;

Where is this one?
This campus which this case arose out

5 of is located in Kansas City, Missouri.
6

QUESTION;

Well, do you think a religious service

7 could be banned in a public park in Kansas City?

Or, as

8 someone suggested, the Reverend Falwell from speaking there?
9

MR. AYRES;

Justice Powell, it's not clear to me

10 from the cases — I don't know that that question has ever
11 been directly answered.

I would say that depending upon the

12 prior usage of such park and depending upon its openness for
13 events other than religious worship services, -14

QUESTION:

Let's assume it's exactly like the

15 student building involved here; it's open for all other
16 groups, as your answers to other questions have indicated.
17 Could the city foreclose use for religious purposes of a

18 public park of that character?
19

MR. AYRES:

Justice Powell, it would be my

20opinion, responding to your question, that if it was -- if

21 the group involved was seeking to hold religious worship
22 services in the park on a regular basis, to the extent they
23 were sought in this case, it is my opinion that Kansas City,
24 based upon establishment grounds, could prohibit such

25 meetings.j

Khat about services which begin at the

2 Lincoln Memorial sometimes with prayers and hymns being
3

sung, and then even more specifically a religious service,

4

the Mass held on the Mall when Pope John Paul II was here

5

several years ago?
MR. AYRES;

6

Mr. Chief Justice, I think we have

7

tried to address those points in our brief.

I think that

8

the National Mall where both of the activities which you

9

referred to would take place has gone beyond and cannot be

10

fairly compared to the campus of a state university.

It is

11

obvious that the National Mall is used for matters, national

12

matters of every spectrum, and to compare that to the campus

13

in this case is not a fair one.
I would also submit with regard to the Pope’s

14
15

visit, which I think the mere special occasion had a lot to

16

do with the decision, but I would also point out that Judge

17

MacKinnon noted the issue in his concurring opinion where he

18

said that to allow these on a irregular basis does not

19

present a problem.

20

worship services even on the National Mall on a regular

recurring basis, such would present establishment clause

22

problems.

ME. AYRES*

And the creche
I think those questions have been

3 answered to some extent by the fact that the Christmas tree,
4 and again to some extent the creche, have gone beyond the
5 religious significance.

That Christmas has become, in

6 effect, a national holiday, a holiday which is equally
7 meaningful to all of us, no matter what our religious
8 affiliation is, and so I think those cases are not
9 pertinent, either.

Mr. Ayres, does it disturb you that

MR. AYRES:

To respond to your question the best

24 way that I may, I think that there are many decisions which
25 indicate that prayer or an acknowledgement of God before a

1 public meeting are suitable in that they serve to set the
2 tone, get the meeting started out in a properly appropriate
3 manner, and I would submit that this situation falls into
4 that catgegory.
5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ayres, I gather some of us at

6 least have thought that in God we trust above the Speaker's
7 bench and the prayer breakfasts and other exercises of that
8 kind fall into the category of political questions, not
9 judicially reviewable in any event.
10

MR. AYRES:

11

QUESTION;

I think that's right, Justice Brennan.
Mr. Ayres, you suggested with respect

12 to the Mass on the Mall that the distinction is between a
13 regular recurring event, as was involved here, and an
14 incidental or irregular event.

But as I understand your

15 regulation, you wouldn't permit these people to meet even
16 once.
17

MR. AYRES:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So I really don't think that's a valid

19 distinction for purposes of defending your own regulation.

20

MR. AYRES;

Well, let me say. Justice Stevens,

21 that again in the context of this case, a one-time meeting
22 was not sought.

It was clear that they sought a regular

23 weekly meeting place for their services.

24

QUESTION;

I understand, but your regulation would

25 prohibit a one-time meeting, if I understand the record

MR. AYRES*

8

QUESTION*

That’s correct. Your Honor.
Mr. Ayres, I assume you were at 10s00

9 o'clock this morning when the Marshal of the Court in
10 announcing the Court pronounced, in effect, a very short
11 benediction when he said God save the United States and this
12 honorable Court.

Is that any different from a ten-minute

13 prayer?
14

MR. AYRES:

I5it is, it is indeed.

Mr. Chief Justice, I would argue that
Again, I would submit to the Court

16 that this is a ceremony to begin this auspicious occasion,
17 to get a proper frame of reference of mind for all those

18 involved.
19

I would submit to the Court that the Ten

20 Commandments stand above on the building.

I think there’s a

21 secular purpose for that because the other famous historical
22 origins of long are also presented.

But I would remind the

23 Court of its opinion in Stone, that the Ten Commandments
24 could not be posted in elementary or secondary schools.

2 would think you could win it without having to claim that if
3 the university allowed these meetings that it would be an
4 establishment.
5

Your question is whether they are permitted,

6 rather than required, to ban these meetings.

I mean, it

QUESTION:

Mr. Ayres, another thing, when the At

5 torney General of Illinois argued the evidence in the case
6 he said that if we ruled against him, we would have to rip
7 down these Ten Commandments up here.

And Mr. Justice

8 Jackson said, quote, "I think we can do it without that.”
9 And he did, right?
10

MR. AYRES*

11

QUESTION*

12 Commandments.

Yes, sir.
So why argue about these Ten

They're still up there.

13

MR. AYRES*

That’s true. Your Honor.

14

(General laughter.)

15

QUESTION*

He didn't get them down, so I don't see

16 how you're going to get them down.
17

MR. AYRES*

Your Honor, it's certainly not my

18 intent to get them down.

19

QUESTION*

Mr. Ayres, is the Attorney General of

20 Missouri in this case at all?

21

MR. AYRES*

No, Your Honor.

The University of

22 Missouri, our Office of General Counsel is handling the case
23itself, and the Attorney General's Office is not involved as
24 an amicus or any other way.

25

QUESTION*

Well, is the Office of the General

3

MR. AYRES*

No, sir.

We would argue that our

4 viewpoint is upheld by several attorney general opinions,
5 Your Honor, but we do not presume to be here on behalf of
6 the Attorney General's office.
7

QUESTION*

Well, but you're here -- the university

10

MR. AYRES;

That's absolutely correct. Justice

13 concerned, with respect to the university you are the

QUESTION;

17

MR. AYRES*

18

Let me just indicate a couple of things before I

19 sit down.

That' s right.
Is that clear as crystal?
In our opinion it is, Justice Blackmun.

As Justice White has indicated, we believe that

20 there are other grounds upon which we can win this case;

21 primarily, the fact that there is no indication that the
22 free exercise rights of the students involved in this case
23 have been infringed.

This was a specific finding of the

and I believe that if the Court will look at

there is no indication that these students have

1 an absolute cardinal precept of their religion that they
2 must worship on university premises.
3

QUESTION;

But isn't it a familiar statement from

4 any of our cases that just because the state allows you to
5 exercise rights of free speech in some other place, then you
6 want to exercise them, is not a defense to its refusal to
7 allow you to exercise them where you do want to exercise
8 them?
9

MR. AYRES;

Would you repeat your question,

10 Justice Rehnquist?
11

QUESTION;

Yes.

In other words, it would not. be

12 enough under our cases under the freedom of speech clause, I
13 take it, to say that you can go down to the marina every
14 morning and have a parade if you want to, when the mall is
15 available and has been used for freedom of speech
16 demonstrations of all sorts.
17

MR. AYRES;

Some of the cases of this Court,

18 Justice Rehnquist, have indicated that because a right is
19 available somewhere else, you cannot foreclose that right at
20 another place.

I would submit to the Court that fact

21 situation was not applicable here under the facts of this
22 case where it was clearly a religious worship service that
23 was sought, and so it would not be applicable to this case.
24

I am going to sit down at this time to allow me

25 some rebuttal.

Mr. Smart?

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. SMART, JR., ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4

MR. SMART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

5 the Court, I want to just remind the Court here that as the
6 Court is well aware, the university has the burden in this
7 case of justifying this regulation.

On its face, the

8 regulation restricts freedom of expression in what would
9 appear from the very facts to be a public forum.

Even if it

10 were net a public form it restricts one category of speech,
11 appears to be invidious discrimination on speech and the
12 university has the burden of establishing here, we do not
13 have the burden.
14

They have to justify their regulation.

QUESTION;

Could the university preclude the use

15 of those meeting room for all purposes if it wanted to,
16 except classes of the university?
17

MR. SMART:

The university -- I think this Court,

18 if that case were to come before it, the Court would have to
19 look at the facts of the case and see, number one, if a free

20 exercise claim was asserted, did this constitute a burden on
21 the free exercise of religion because of the nature of the
22 campus or did it inhibit academic freedom of the students
23 and freedom to inquire because they had no opportunity to
24 have meetings or to invite outside speakers on any subject,

25 and the court might well find that such a rule that
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTIONS

Even if justified, Mr. Smart, by a

5 compelling state interest?
6

MR. SMARTS

7

QUESTION;

Well, that is the key, Your Honor.
Yes, but it has to be a compelling

8 state interest, I take it.
9

MR. SMART;

It has to be a compelling state

10 interest, Your Honor.
11

QUESTION;

Did I correctly understand one of Mr.

12 Ayres’ arguments to be that the compelling state interest in
13 this instance was the desire to avoid any of the
14 complications that might lead to the establishment of a
15 religion?

Would you regard that as a compelling state

16 interest ?
17

MR. SMART:

I think that the establishment clause

18 could be a compelling state interest.

You have a teacher in

19 front of a classroom who says, I want to exercise my free
20 speech rights, and the principal says no, you may have your

21 free speech rights but in this case the establishment clause
22 is a compelling state interest that prohibits you.

I think

23 it could be.

24

In this case, though, we are not talking about a

25 teacher speaking; we are talking about private individuals

2

QUESTION*

Even so, I gather, if I understand Mr.

3 Ayres’ argument, it is that — I know, but to permit this
4 sort of thing is to expose the university to possible
5 problems under the establishment clause of our being accused
6 of favoring religion and therefore violating the
/establishment clause.

And our compelling state interest is

8 to avoid that possibility.

10 Honor.

ME. SMART*

Wasn't that his argument?

That's his argument apparently, Your

We contend that the university, while desiring to

11 avoid establishment clause problems, marches straight into
12 establishment clause problems by having the primary effect
13 of inhibiting religion.

QUESTION;

Let me ask you, suppose a group of

15 students organize a denomination of a particular religion on
16 the campus, and they say well, we have to have someplace
17 regularly to meet like others.

And they have a minister who

18 will come and preach to them at these meetings, and they
19 want the university to let them use, say, one of its
20 buildings as their church.

And they frankly say, we can't

21 afford a church but if we had a church, we would meet in it,
22 but we don't, and we want to use your building as a

It will be basically the same argument

QUESTION;

And you say the university would be

10

required to let them hold regular church services, use their

11

building as a church.

That's your argument.

MR. SMART*

12

Provided they were treated as any

14

QUESTION*

Exactly.

But your argument would say

15

that the university would be required to use their building

MR. SMART;

20
21

QUESTION*

Well, the university, as Justice

Brennan suggests your colleague is arguing, the university

22 doesn't want to get that close to religion, and it wants to
23

stay more neutral, and it doesn't want to have its

QUESTION;

Would there be anything to interfere

8 with the university saying that there would a fixed fee for
9 the use of the room by any group including this church group
10 that is hypothesized?
11

MR. SMART;

There would be absolutely nothing

12 wrong with a regular fixed fee that was applied equally
13 across the board to all special interest groups.

If they

14 wish to subsidize the light and heat and so on, that could
15 easily be done by a fee.
16 accommodation.

However, I think the key is equal

In this case there is a distinction between

17 sponsorship and accommodation that the university seems to
18completely overlook.
19

When a university invites Billy Graham or someone

20 on campus and has him speak, then you've got some
21 sponsorship involved, then you've got some cooperation and
22 involvement of the government in this religion.

I do not believe they can be applied to

The university — I mean, the Missouri Supreme

22 Court has, to my knowledge, the latest pronouncement on that

24 grants to university students who would then attend
25 sectarian universities in Missouri.

1

MR. SMART*

2

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor
Mr. Smart, you have argued, I believe,

3 that by not permitting the group to meet on campus for its
4 services, that some stigma attached in the minds of the
5 students by virtue of that.

Would the reverse be true, and

6 by allowing the group to hold its sessions on campus does
7 that imply some kind of sponsorship or approval by the
8 university?
9

MR. SMART*

It does not imply approval.

If it

10 does, then the university has some difficulties, because as
11 we noted in our brief, the university has allowed, while
12 Cornerstone was off campus the university has allowed
13 transcendental meditation, which has been held to be a
14 religion by the Third Circuit.

They allowed Sri Jim Noy,

15 Indian spiritual master who is an Eastern mystic.

They even

16-- the university even sponsored a film with this on campus.
17

So if it implies approval, then thereby their own

18 regulation they’re violating their own regulation
19 themselves.

Secondly, it really doesn't imply approval

20 because the university has declared no sponsorship.

21 Footnote 44 of our brief refers to the fact that the
22 university says, we'll not allow our name to be used by any
23 of these groups.

24

In other words, they don’t want Cornerstone going

25 out and saying we are the University of Missouri Cornerstone

The university says,

2 Keep us out of it; we don’t sponsor them.

If they want to

3 make a bigger sign and put it on top of Jesse Hall in
4 Columbia, Missouri, they can do that.
5

QUESTION;

Mr. Ayres has conceded that the Young

6 Communists League or the Marxist Society could meet, and
7 surely, the university wouldn't undertake to sponsor or
8 endorse them.
9

MR. SMART;

I trust they would not undertake to do

10 that, and I think that also relates to the financial aid
11 argument here.

If there is financial aid to religion by

12 this -- by a neutral policy that would allow religious
13 groups on campus, then there must be financial aid to the
14 Young Marxist group.
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Ayres says that these are spot

16 times and it's not regular.

You

Does that regularity, when you

3 look at the facts, does it connote sponsorship.
4

If it does not because all the other groups are

5 meeting regularly and there's no particular favoritism
6 involved, then you have no sponsorship, you have no
/establishment clause violation.
8

If there's any preemption of space — if

9 Cornerstone would walk up and say we want a five-year lease,
10 we want a free, five-year lease on such-and-such a room, and
11 the university says okay, we've got to give it to you.

So

12 Cornerstone has that five-year lease, and other groups come
13 along and say hey, we'd like to use that room once in a
14 while, too, you know, and the university says no, they've
15 got it.

Then you might have an establishment problem

16 because there would be favoritism toward religion.
17

QUESTION*

Mr. Smart, does the university have a

18 specific regulation with respect to non-campus groups; those
19 that may come in casually?
20

MR. SMART*

The university's policy, as I

21 understand it and Mr. Ayres can correct me if I'm wrong, is

6 religious services by any student or non-student group.
7

QUESTION:

Is it conceded in this case, or does

8 the record show that no outside religious group would be
9 allowed to hold any sort of meeting on the campus?
10

MR. SMART*

Well, I think the facts would show --

11 and Mr. Ayres can correct me if I'm wrong -- that prior to
12 the invocation of this regulation in January 1977, probably
13 religious groups were -- in fact, I know religious groups
14 were using, outside religious groups to some extent, were
15 using the facilities there.

17

MR. SMART*

Outside groups.
Outside groups, apparently on a

19 that.

23 in

MR. SMART:

The university enacted this regulation

1972 but began enforcing it in January of 1977, and in

24 this case it is significant that it was applied not only to

25 the use of the buildings, but also, to the use of the

2 the facts at the trial level in the case.
3

QUESTION:

Would you agree that a university has

4 more control over the use of its campus than a city does
5 over a public square, provided the control is exercised
6 uniformly?
7

MR. SMART:

I think that there could well be a

8 distinction in a given case, Your Honor.

I think in this

9 case, the university really exercises no more control over
10 its space than a park that has shelter houses and requires
11 people to call in and reserve those shelter houses in
12 advance.

I think that's about the degree of control we have

13 here.
14

QUESTION:

But whatever the degree of control,

15 counsel, could the university discriminate as between and
16 among groups on the basis of the content of what took place
17 in the meeting?
18

MR. SMART:

Absolutely not. Your Honor.

20 and made it very clear in case there was any doubt before

18 see, this regulation purports to allow business meetings but
19 not prayer meetings.

20

Now, is the university going to go down and make

21 sure that nobody gives an opening prayer or that the prayer
22 is no longer than three minutes before they start the
23 business meeting?

To avoid those kind of dangers, the

24 university would have to monitor the meetings, censor out

25 the conduct —

QUESTIONS

I take it, for example, a Roman

2 Catholic Church couldn't have a Hass under this regulation,
3 but what about the Holy Name Society having a meeting?
4

MR. SMART:

If the Holy Name Society were going to

5 only have a business meeting, then presumably, the
6 university would let them.
7

QUESTION*

But we’re contending --

But the university would have to decide

8 whether it was a religious meeting or not, I take it, to
9 apply this regulation.
10

MR. SMART:

Also, you have an interesting

11 question; whether a business meeting is not an integral part
12 of the activities of the Holy Name Society, which would
13 probably be a pervasively religious group, and we get back
14 to some of the Lemon vs. Kurtzman thinking.
15

QUESTION*

But if the university rents its

16 facilities to off-campus groups for a fee, your position
17 would be, I take it, that if the Catholic Church wanted to
18 rent one of its buildings on a regular basis to hold its
19 church services, that the university would have to rent it.

arrangement with the Missouri School of

QUESTION:

7

I

Mr. Smart, do you see any differences

between the circumstances here involving a university and

9 the

use of its premises as opposed to that of a high school

10 or a grammar school?
11

MR. SMART:

12 fundamental

I think when we look at the

principles underlying the First Amendment, the

13 principles of volunteerism,

neutrality, we may find the

14 younger

we get -- for instance, in Stein vs. Oskinsky, a

15 case in

the briefs which was a kindergarten class where some

16 parents said we want our kids to be able to have voluntary
17 prayer in the kindergarten.
18 that, of course, is

-- there's no such thing as voluntary

19 anything in kindergarten.

And Judge Friendly said well,

And I think when you consider age

21 school is different from college or anything.

I think you

Age is one factor.

24

QUESTION;

Has this Court made a distinction

25 between universities and

high schools and grade schools
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And

1 already?
2

MR. SMART*

This Court has many times in its aid

3 to education cases drawn a distinction, particularly where
4 the aid is going to a university which is church-related,
5 and the Court has noticed that the chances of that
6 church-related institution using that to indoctrinate or
7 impose its beliefs on students was very limited, very
8 small.

He think that's a little bit different in this case

9 because here we're talking about a meeting of students;
10 we're not talking about an authority structure.

We're

11 talking about a voluntary meeting that student interested
12 can come to if he wants to but there’s no requirement that
13 any student attend this meeting.

It's not under the

14 exclusive control of any religious body.
15

We submit that a neutral policy would be like the

16 tax exemption in the Walz case.

A longstanding practice,

17 the effect of allowing tax exemptions for religious as well
18 as other entities has not been to establish religions.

And

19 the opposite, if a state were to deny tax exemptions to
20 religion there might be a risk of excessive entanglement.
21 There would be a greater tendency for entanglement.

22

We think those are all factors that merit the

23 Court's consideration here.

24

QUESTION;

In this case --

Do we have anything comparable to the

25 tax exemption history in the way of a custom of allowing
41

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 religious meetings -2

MR. SMART;

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

In our brief

3 we've referred to the fact that Thomas Jefferson encouraged
4 and allowed the sectarian religious instruction on the
5 grounds of the University of Virginia in 1822, which was
6 when it was opened, or shortly thereafter.

There are a

7 number of -- well, I would submit that almost every
8 university in this country has allowed at one time or
9 another religious activities on campus.
10

In 1891, the University of Illinois upheld a

11 provision where the university actually sponsored the chapel
12 on campus.
13

It wasn't a student group.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smart, when Thomas Jefferson

14 conducted the activity at the University of Virginia, wasn't
15 that before the Fourteenth Amendment had been used to apply
16 the First Amendment freedoms to the state?
17

MR. SMART;

Yes.

That is correct, that was before

18 the Everson case which was the first case that really, apart
19 from the Cantwell case, applied the Fourteenth --

20

QUESTION;

So that's not really a very good

21 argument, is it, for your --

22

MR. SMART;

Well, I think it's a very good

23 argument when we're saying what is the history.

I'm not

24 saying that what Thomas Jefferson wanted to do would be
25 correct law today,

but I'm saying that's the history.
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And

1 I'm saying we can look at that and see has there been an
2 establishment of religion, or has there been simply an aid
3 to the free exercise of religion.
4

QUESTION:

I thought you were saying that what

5 Thomas Jefferson did is the law today.
6

MR. SMART:

7 facts of that.

Well, we’d have to look at the exact

I think that what he did might not be

8 because what he recommended was that professors meet with
9 these students and teach these sectarian principles with
10 them, and that would seem to be more of an establishmen t of
11 religion than we're asking for right here.

And I think this

12 Court might not allow us to go that far.
13

But we think the main problem with this regulation

14 is that it is an invidious discrimination against religion.
15 A neutral policy has no primary effect of doing anything
16 except promoting inter-communication between students.

In

17 McDaniel v. Paty the court struck down the Tennessee
18 requirement concerning eligibility of ministers to hold
19 public office, and I note in that case that Justice Brennan

20 and Justice Marshall held that that provision violated the
21 establishment clause.

And I submit to you that this case is

22a better case to hold that the regulation in this case
23 violates the establishment clause than that one, because of
24 the fact that religion is so clearly given second-class
25 status,

it is stigmatized, it's considered as not worthy of
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 being treated the same as the other activities.
2

It's a fallacy to say that when you omit something

3 you say nothing about it.

In this case, the university is

4 propagandizing and saying religion does not need to be
5 allowed on the campus.

We'll meet all the other needs but

6 we will not meet a religious need except maybe we'll favor a
7 few certain religions that are not traditional western
8 religions.

We'll allow some eastern religions and things

9 like this, but we will not allow -- .
10

And the state has decided that religion is

11 compartmentalized and can be off campus, and they have
12 regulation which is arbitrary.
13 at Columbia campus.

It allows worship in chapel

No chapel at UMPC, and I'm not sure why

14 religion has to be confined to a chapel anyway.

It's over

15 broad, it by its terms would appear to apply to a bull
16 session in a dormitory late at night where three or four
17 people are talking and one of them maybe has been to Bible
18 school before, so he knows more and so he begins to
19 expound.

It would appear to apply to that.

20

This Court has given the highest degree of

21 protection to religious expression in the past in cases like
22 Tucker vs. State of Texas, Murdock vs. Pennsylvania,
23 Cantwell vs. Connecticut and on and on, and we submit that
24 the government in this case has no business deciding that in
25a public forum that religion is not entitled to the same

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

treatment as other forms of expression, even though it is

2 public property.

We submit that if the fact that it's public

3
4

property bothers the Court to some extent, keep in mind the

5

fact that the key is equal accommodation, no favoritism to

6

religion, no sponsorship of religion.

7

accommodation.
This Court's been very sensitive in the past to

8
9

Just equal

government actions promoting religion.

For instance, Stone

10

vs. Graham; so sensitive, in fact, that you reversed the

11

decision of the Kentucky court without even hearing

12

arguments; you reversed it outright on petition for cert.

13

submit that this Court also can be just as sensitive to

14

government hostility to religion as it has been for

15

government promotion and sponsorship of religion.

16

Particularly at the univeristy, which is the marketplace of

17

ideas, and religion should be allowed to find -- to be

18

placed in its own spectrum by the marketplace in which it

19

exists.

The students will put it where it needs to be.
