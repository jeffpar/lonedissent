ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY COLE, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLE:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

9 Court*
10
11

The case is here on appeal from a divided court of
appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the

12 Seventh Circuit.

The case presents the questions of whether

13 the prohibitions and limitations on trade association
14 solicitation contained

in 1976 Amendments to the Federal

15 Election Campaign Act can survive the exacting scrutiny
16 demanded by
17

the First and Fifth Amendments.

It is our position in brief that the restrictions

18 and limitations are unconstitutional.
19 fully appreciate the genesis of

I think in order to

the case and the precise

20 nature of the prohibitions that are involved,

21 back to a time prior to May of
22 date of the
23

one must go

1976, which was the effective

1976 Amendments.

Prior to that time, trade associations solicited

24 voluntary political contributions from a wide and broad
25 range of people, basically who fell within

— people who

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

shared a commonality or affinity of political interests.

2 Those political solicitations were undertaken without regard
3

to whether or not the prospective contributor was an

4

employee of a member corporation of the trade association.

5

And, most importantly, they were undertaken without

6

obtaining the prior permission of anyone.

7

With the coming of the 1967 Amendments, however,

8 trade association solicitation underwent a radical and

9 drastic transformation.

For now, no longer could trade

10

associations solicit from this rather broad group of people

11

who shared a commonality of purpose and interests; rather,

12 they were restricted by the Act to either their own
13

shareholders or their own executives and administrators —

14

and that range of people was very small by virtue of the

15

inherent characteristics of trade associations -- and/or

16

they could solicit the executives and administrative

17

personnel and the stockholders of those member corporations.

18
19

But in addition to these restrictions, perhaps the
most throttling restriction was that before even that narrow

20 solicitation could be undertaken,
21

the trade association

political action committee had to receive the permission

22 from the member corporation.

That is to say, the executive

23

or administrative employee could not make a determination on

24

his own of whether or not he wanted to be solicited.

25

task was entrusted by the Act to the corporation.

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

The

That

1

corporation had sole and unthrottled discretion in the

2 matter.

It was unreviewable by anybody, and indeed, it

3 could be denied without regard to the wishes of the
4 corporate employee himself.
5

In addition to that restriction, the Act imposed

6 one final restriction, and that was even if all of the other
7 statutory prohibitions had been satisfied,
8 corporation

and even if the

in it's largesse gave permission, the potential

9 contributor could only be solicited by one trade
10 association,
11

regardless of the amount of overlap of

membership in other separate, distinct and autonomous

12 associations.

13

QUESTION*

Mr. Cole, is there anything in the Act

14 that prevents a trade association from seeking to add these
15 people as members of the trade association?
16

ME. COLEs

Mr. Justice Rehnguist, there is

17 absolutely nothing except the practical realities of life.
18 The Act itself, as you rightly point out,
19 a trade association from going out and

does not restrict

soliciting people to

20 join with it as a member.
21

The difficulty is, and the record makes clear, that

22 trade associations have rather large operating budgets.
23 Individuals do not have the wherewithal — and I suspect
24 they do not have the inclination

-- to be able to support a

25 trade association's activities.

So the right to solicit for

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

2

individual membership is largely illusory.
But even if it were not. Your Honor, if underlying

3

your question is the suggestion that has been made by the

4

government that we could thus avoid the restraints of the

5

sections of the Act, then I think we are giving

6 constitutional significance to an irrelevancy.
7

I am aware of no case in the history of this Court,

8 or any court, which has said otherwise unconstitutional
9

prohibitions are okay and are palatable simply because there

10

is a method of avoiding them.

Circuit said and that is what the government is suggesting

12

to this Court.

13

And that is what the Seventh

committee and with other like-minded people.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

As a consequence of these restraints and as a

2 consequence of the impositions imposed by the Act, we filed

3 suit in the Unite! States District Court for the Northern
4 District for Illinois.

After some very protracted

5 proceedings in that court and in the Court of Appeals, the
6 case ultimately came on for hearing before the Seventh

7 Circuit sitting eh banc pursuant to Section 437h of the Act.
8

The decision of the court below was divided in some

9 instances and unanimous in others.

The court unanimously

10

held that the plaintiffs had standing under 2 U.S.C. 437h to

11

maintain the action.

12

QUESTION;

The court, however —
Mr. Cole, on that point, how does the

13 committee fit under the language of the statute, 437h, as a
14 plaintiff?
15

MR. COLE;

We certainly do not contend that we fit

16 within the explicit enumerated categories of people set
17 forth in 437h.

We are not the Federal Election Commission,

18 and we are certainly not the National Committee of a
19 political party, and we are certainly not, as an entity,
20 individuals eligible to vote.
21

Although, Your Honor, let me

point out that our members, at least the members of the

22 Political Action Committees themselves, which are separate,

23 distinct entities as this Court held in California Medical
24 Association, are comprised solely and completely of members,
25 of individuals.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

The Federal Election Commission has never contested

1

2 that point from the time the Seventh Circuit panel announced
3 its decision in

1979 saying that aside from everything else,

4 the plaintiffs had associational standing under the rules of
5

this Court by virtue of our representation of individuals.

6 The Commission has never suggested or said that we do not
7 represent individuals.

They simply have said that we don't

8 fall within the literal language of the statute.

So I think, Your Honor, that we have associational

9

10 standing without any
11

question at all, but beyond that, it

seems to me that merely because we don't fall within the

12 explicit enumerations of the Act does not mean that we are
13

not a proper party.

The purpose of that statute, 437h, as

14 this court unequivocally held in Buckley,
15

was to provide

standing to the limit of Article III of the Constitution.
That beneficent purpose cannot possibly be

16

17 fulfilled if only the three explicitly enumerated parties
18 are accorded

standing.

and corporations, who are the entities most

20 intimately and

It would mean that unions, trade

profoundly affected by the 1976 Amendments,

at least in the context of this case, could not maintain an

22 action under 437h, even though an anonymous voter from
23 Boise,

Idaho who had absolutely no interest in the

24 particular provisions could

come into court, get the

25 substantially expedited review that

the statute allows,

Q'JESTION:

2

Well, is this an argument that if

3

Congress, after enumerating those three, had said "and no

4

one else", the statute would be unconstitutional?
HR. COLE;

5

I think, Hr. Justice Erennan, that the

6 Congress perhaps could well have suggested that only those
7

three explicitly-enumerated categories of people could avail

8

themselves of the Act.

9

say "and only those."

10

The question is, though, it does not
And thus, one must divine the

legislative intent underlying that statute.
QUESTION;

11

But if it is to read as if "and only

12

those" appeared, you would have no challenge to its

13

constitutionality?

14

HR. COLE;

15

QUESTION;

HR. COLE:

If by that. Hr. Chief Justice, you mean

it is meant to be explicitly exclusive, I disagree with

20 you.
21

The statute is certainly quite explicit

in identifying three entities, is it not?

18
19

We have certainly

not made any.

16
17

I think we would not.

If you mean it says what it says, of course I agree

with you.

But I recall Hr. Justice Frankfurter's admonition

22 that the notion that because the words of the statute are
23

plain, it’s meaning is also plain is pernicious

24

over-simplification.

25

And one must look at the legislative intent

underlying the statute, and the intent clearly is to provide

by this Court.

And that's perhaps the most important factor.

QUESTION:

Justice Frankfurther also said when the

language of the statute is clear, that we don't need to look

6 at the legislative history, didn't he?
7

MR. COLE:

Yes.

8 certainly is not clear.

And the language of the statute

referred to the inexactitude of congressional language in
the Act itself.

association, couldn't you?

16

MR. COLE:

Are you asking me could we have?

17

QUESTION;

Yes.

18

MR. COLE:

There was some question at the time of

19

the availability of people to come in.

It was our view that

20 the statute was at least to us clear that it would be
21

incongruous to read the statute in the way the FEC has done,

22 and that we didn't need anybody.
23
24
25

And the case ultimately

progressed as it did.
Interestingly enough, had we brought in an officer
of one of the plaintiffs, the FEC would have contested, as

10

1

it did in the California Medical Association case, that the

2 identity of the officer and the identity of the corporate

3 entity were fully congruent and thus, that individual had no
4 standing, although he fell. Your Honor, within the literal
5 language of 437h.
QUESTION;

6

I suppose your position is that if this

7 caes were thrown out because of a narrow interpretation of
8

that sentence, that the entire purpose of Congress in

9 getting expedited review of the constitutional questions
10 would be thwarted.
11
12 Seventh

MR. COLE:

Totally thwarted.

The opinion of the

Circuit — and I think our briefs -- explain in some

13 detail precisely why that is so.

I must again underscore

14 the fact. Your Honor, even if you were to read the statute
15 in a very narrow way, it seems to me that we would still
16 have standing under 437 in this case under accepted and
17 established and I think unquestioned principles of
18 associational standing.
19

QUESTION;

Do you allege in your complaint, or did

20 you prove, that the individuals for whom you calim
21 associational standing are eligible to vote?
22

MR. COLE:

No, we did not.

And let me tell you,

23 Mr. Justice Rehnguist, in retrospect, why that was not
24 done.

When the Seventh Circuit announced its opinion in

25 December of

1979, it articulated the proposition that we had

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
\/na>r w a aw-

ci»/

\»/AC'jli'iciv'nv

^ r*

/o,"iov eT>

<e

1

associational standing by virtue of the individual members

2 that the plaintiffs possess.

3

Now, thereafter, there were long proceedings

4 involving discovery, the preparation of stipulated facts and
5 so on.

The Commission never once suggested, ever, that out

6 of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individual people who

7 were contributors and thus members of the PAC's, that these
8 people, at least one of them, was not an individual voter.

9 And thus, the need for proof never arose.
10
11

QUESTION:

But the need for allegation may have

MR. COLEj

Well, I think that the Seventh Circuit

arisen.

12

13 was very clear, as all of us were at the time, that we were
14 not representing people who were 14 and 15 and 16 years
15 old.

The people that we were representing were people who

16 were intimately concerned with and involved in the political
17 process.

And clearly, at least one of them was eligible to

18 vote, and the government never suggested to the contrary.
QUESTION:

19

But even if the members were eligible to

20 vote, does it necessarily follow that the action that they
21

might have brought as individuals would be the same as the

22 action the association could bring, challenging restrictions

23 in the statute on associational activity?
24
25 Stevens.

MR. COLE:

I think that it does, Mr. Justice

The

allegations are clear on the face of the complaint, and that

22 is that they impact adversely on not only the rights of

the

23

trade associations and the political action committees, but

24

indeed — and we explicitly noted this in the complaint, and

25

it is in I think one of our briefs, either our opening or

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

reply brief — that it also impacted adversely on the right

2 of prospective solicitees.

That is, the corporate

3 executives, administrators and stockholders of our member
4 corporations.
5

Ani I agree with you. Hr. Justice Stevens, there

6 were many, many challenges at issue in Buckley.

But all of

7 those challenges jurisdictionally were subsumed under 437h.
8 So the diversity of the challenges, I think, does not speak
9 to the question of the Court’s underlying jurisdiction.

And

10 the Court’s focus, unlike the district court’s focus in
11

Buckley, was not on the individual plaintiffs; it was rather

12 upon the organizational plaintiffs who had associational or
13 organizational standing.
14

QUESTION;

Then how do you read the statute?

You

15 say that listed persons and anybody else who might be
16 adversely affected by anything in the statute has the
17 standing to

18

make a challenge.

MR. COLE;

20 notions of standing.
21

QUESTION;

Well, it certainly does.

It gives

22 certain remedies to certain specific people that they
23 wouldn't otherwise have.

Does that mean that it gives it to

24 everybody?
25

MR. COLE;

Yes.

I think Congress felt that all of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION:

There are a lot of other statutes where

MR. COLE:

It means --

5

QUESTION:

Well, a lot of times that happens.

6

MR. COLE:

If people either have to have the

7 temerity to violate the law and then see what the FEC will
8 do, or -- and this is the more likely consequence — they
9 will be chilled in their activity and not undertake the
10 activity,
11
12

thereby precluding the very enforcement proceeding

in which to raise the challenge defensively.
QUESTION:

Well, there’s a presumption that the

13 statute is valid, of course.
14

MR. COLE:

Of course.

And this Court sits to

15 review that.

QUESTION:

If there hadn't been the special appeal

17 provisions and you just wanted to bring a declaratory

19 probably could have.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION:

I'll find out why they think that

2

MR. COLE:

Underlying the general prohibitions, the

3

longstanding general prohibitions against corporate and

4

union expenditures and contributions in federal elections

5

was the felt perception that these entities, because of

6

their aggregated wealth and otherwise, had had a corrosive

7

and pernicious effect on our whole system of representative

8

government.

9

Ironically, however, the Act that is presently

10

before the Court entrusts to those various entities the

11

censorial power of determining whether or not employees of

12

member corporations can have the right to receive telephone

13

calls soliciting, to receive mail seeking political

14

contributions; indeed, to be able to talk to another citizen

15

on the street to solicit for a political contribution now

16

requires the arbitrary discretionary consent of the very

17

entities that have so polluted the process.
The corporation, I think it ought to be noted, can

18
19

decline permission under the Act for any reason or for no

20 reason.
21

It can do so because the corporate officer in

charge doesn't like the stance, political stance, that a

22 trade association perhaps has taken.

It can do so because

23

it doesn't like the corporation's stance on -- there are too

Is that

Yes, that's my understanding, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

No.

And my answer —

I meant really to ask you if that

kind of a provision would be unconstitutional.
MB. COLE:

5

No.

I think if there was an equivalency

6

of treatment which, as we have argued in our briefs, there

is not, that would be an unconstitutional, the answer is

It seems to me, however, there is a patent

discrimination in this case —

MR. COLE*

I think the present regulation is indeed

4 more severe than that.

It seems to me — and this is at

as I understand it, of the Department of

6 Justice — that corporations' unions have the right to
7 solicit and the right to communicate with not simply some

8 very narrow range of individuals, but all of those people

with whom there is a shared political or commonality of

interest.

QUESTION;

14

Mr. Cole, prior to 1976, what could an

15 association do in this respect?

It could solicit funds, but

16 could it make contributions in political campaigns?

MR. COLE;

It could not.

Yes.

Oh, it could?

MR. COLE;

Yes, sir, it could.

4

QUESTION;

Even though corporations and unions

5 could not?
6

MR. COLE;

Yes, because it was not —

7 theoretically, at least — not the union's funds that were
8 being contributed; it was the funds of contributors all
9 around that were doing nothing more than using the PAC as a
10 focal point for political affiliation.
11

QUESTION;

You could create PAC's, then, --

12

MR. COLE;

Yes, sir.

Without limitation.

MR. COLE;

And that has been the case since the

So what you would like to do is knock

No, I would like to have the restraints

in Subsection (D), in effect, inter-lineated.

We are not

2

MR. COLE;

Well, that's the question; whether or

3 not the Hansen Amendment constituted a modification or
4 codification or prior law.
5 that case in Pipefitters.

This Court refused to decide
But it seems to me that given the

6 rationale of the First Amendment, that corporations, unions
7 and trade associations always had the right to communicate

8 with, in whatever way they wanted and with their own funds,
9 that group with whom they shared an affinity of interest.
10 And as this Court said in Pipfitters, precisely the same

11 rationale underlays the right to solicit political funds.
12 And I would like to reserve the balance of my time for
13 rebuttal.
14

QUESTION;

Counsel, before you sit down, is it your

15 position that the right to solicit funds by the trade
16 association is entitled to the same level of constitutional

17 protection as other forms of political speech, without any
18 difference?
19

It's entitled to the same level of protection?

MR. COLE;

I had thought, until Mr. Justice

20 Marshall's opinion in California Medical, that there had not
21 been a dispute that the right to solicit or, indeed, to make
22 political contributions — and the two are not exactly the
23 same, although they are obverse sides of the same coin -24 was subject to the exacting scrutiny under the First and
25 Fifth Amendments.

I had thought, again in light of the

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Chief Justice's opinion in Citizens Against Rent Control v.

2 Berekely,

that that question would now have been decided in

3 the affirmative.
4

Yes.

My answer to you is solicitation is

5 intimately bound up with speech.
6

And what we have done is

to simply want to go out and talk to people and to see if,

7 in the competition of the marketplace, we can align
8 ourselves with

them and to win their political allegiance.

9 That’s really what is going on, and that we cannot do.
10 it seems to me that

11

the exacting scrutiny under the First

Amendment is the test that is to be applied, not some

12 diminished

13

standard of review.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES N. STEELE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

16

And

MR. STEELE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

17 the Court:
18

I would like to deal first with the issue of

19 regarding 437h,

which is the sole basis for jurisdiction

20

asserted here.

In effect, I think that the question before

21

the Court is a question that was explicitly left open by th

22 California Medical Association case last term, and that is
23 whether the parties not enumerated by the statute have
24 standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts to hear
25 cases under the specialized procedures of Section 437h.

1

Basically, we have here a conflict with appellants

2 on both questions.
3 bases under

Appellants, it seems to me, assert two

which this Court shoud read 437h as allowing

4 them to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts.

First they

5 argue that as a matter of this Court’s associational rights
6 doctrine, that they are sufficiently related to individuals
7 to be able to assert those rights as an association on
8 behalf of individuals.
9

They draw on the long line of cases, some of them

10 referred to

11

by this Court in Buckley with regard to

associations that were there, that say that individuals —

12 that started from

the premise that individuals should be

13 able to assert constitutional rights when those rights might
14 be lost if they didn't assert them, and have since been
15 expanded to a much broader basis that allows associations to
16 assert individual constitutional rights.
17

We would urge this Court, however, not to extent

18 that to this case because the plaintiffs here are not
19 associations which represent individuals.
20 trade associations.
21 they are controlled

They are, indeed,

They represent the business interests,
by corporations.

The record is replete

22 with the fact that all of the governing structure of all of
23 these trade associations comes from the corporate
24 membership.

The voting rights -- there are not individual

25 voting rights, and by and large, the control of those is

W'lE'l" UAL A

left to the business interest.

And therefore, what is

2 represented by these trade associations and by their
3

separate segregated funds, the political committees which

4

they have established, which they finance and which they

5

control, are the interests of the trade associations.

6
7

And I would have this Court look at its decision in
the Pipefitters case for the fact that clearly, a

8 corporation's separate segregated fund — the political
9

committee that it was allowed to establish under the 1971-72

10

Amendments and that this Court examined in the 1973 case of

11

Pipefitters, that the control there is with the trade

12

association, with the corporation.

13

Moreover, under those amendments, they are

14

explicitly allowed to establish and to finance, to maintain,

15

those, so that there is in this statute not — the political

16

committee is not the paradigm of a political committee made

17

up of individuals.

18

as controlled by the corporation.

19

The statute establishes these committees

Accordingly, while they are, -- as we have not

20

contested, while the contributions to them are ones that are

21

made voluntarily by individuals, they are not associations

22 in the sense of individual associations.

They are not a

23

situation of ten individuals getting together.

Indeed, one

24

of the balances struck by Congress in the statute was

25

explicitly noted by this Court in the CIO case and in the

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Ann VIRGINIA AVF

SW

WASHINGTON D C. 9nn9A t9n'>\ SKA-93AK

1 legislative history, that nothing in this statute bars ten
2 individuals who are members of the union from going out and
3 setting up a political action committee, or of a
4 corporation.

What is barred by this statute is the use of

5 the corporate or labor organization funds.
6

So that what is at issue here with regard to the

7 437h issue in the associational sense is the question that
8 we have put forth, and contrary to my brother, Hr. Cole, I
9 think that the Commission has consistently challenged the
10 fact that they have standing to assert individual rights.
A second challenge that they bring to the 437h area

11

12 is that it's the nature of the challenge which should
13

dominate here.

They agree, as was said in response to

14

Justice O’Connor's question, that they are not among the

15

enumerated parties, but they say that those enumerated

16 parties are not what establishes the standing; that the
standing is much broader than that.

17

That indeed, as they

18 have phrased it, particularly in their opening brief, it is
the nature of the challenge that Congress was putting

19

20 forward.
In support of that, they have — as the bare words

21

22 of the statute, which say explictly and which we have
23

contended throughout say explicitly, only three parties.

24

The opinion of the court below indicated that they felt that

25

the reason for putting in those three parties was to expand
/

1

the jurisdiction.

That there might have been doubt about

2 any one of those three

— the Commission, the national

3 committee of a politcal party or an individual eligible to
4 vote, -- as to whether they could bring suit.
5

The words of the statute are bare.

The legislative

6 history of the statute does not seem to me to support the
7 idea that that was meant to be read that broadly.
8

So it seems to me that this Court is remitted to

9 the basic idea that Congress would be the one that
10 establishes
11

the jurisdiction, and indeed, appellants here do

not challenge the fact that this is a question of

12 interpretation,

of what was Congress’ intent in enacting

13 this statute.
14

And once again, we would urge this Court to view

15 that as not being a broad base attempt to say that anyone
16 can bring suit, but that the Congress very explicitly set
17 forth those

parties.

That particularly where you are

18 talking — and as we've noted in cases cited -- particularly
19 where you are talking extraordinary jurisdiction,

as you

20 certainly are where you have a certification of issues from
21

a district court, an en banc court of appeals and a right of

22 appeal to this Court, that the ordinary thrust would be to
23 construe that narrowly.
24

Thus, with regard to the 437h issue, we would urge

25 this Court to reject both of the theories that they have put

28

forth for the broad interpretation

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Steele, could I ask you what you see

3 as the interest of the goverment in imposing the
4 restrictions that it did on the solicitation of funds by
5 trade associations?

I mean, assuming that the government

6 has a legitimate interest in limiting the contributions that
7 can be made

to candidates in a federal election by

8 corporations or trade associations.

What is the

9 government’s interest in limiting the people from whom
10 solicitations can be made?
11

MR. STEELE:

I think that question goes to the

12 heart of another disagreement that we have with appellants,

13 which is really the effect of the

1976 Amendments.

Which is

14 to say, as was said in response to Justice White's
15 questions, in the Commission's view, this statute is part
16 and parcel of the

441b prohibitions which have been in the

17 statute since 1907;
18 610, and contain a

they were originally there as 18 U.S.C.
broad prohibition on the use of

19 corporation funis, any corporation whatsoever.
20

But that prohibition has been balanced over time by

21 the Congress and by decisions of this Court and the
22 Congress'

reactions to those decisions for those parties

23 specified in 441b,

corporations and labor organizations, a

24 balance of that that allows them to establish, finance,
25 maintain and control a fund which is allowed to solicit

What

2 it referred to in the legislative history as the beneficial

In 1947, the amendment to

5 forth as members, that members were the parallel in the
6 labor organization situation to the shareholders of the
7 corporation, in effect.
8

So that the statutory interest underlying this is a

9 limitation of the use of the corporation's funds, and these
10 trade associations are corporations.
11 to solicit outside.

The use of those funds

That the compromise, the balance that

12 was reached between the initial enactment, the 1947
13 enactments, the response to that in the CIO case and then
>
14 the Pipefitters case, was a special situation for these
15 organizations, which allows a corporation to spend all of
16 the corporate funds for the limited purpose of communicating
17 with its beneficial owners and the operators, the executive
18 and administrative personnel.
19

So that the government purpose underlying, the

20 governmental basis underlying it, is that of 441b.

I would

21 note in —
22

QUESTION:

Well, could you have a less restrictive

23 requirement, then, of letting volunteers solicit from anyone
24 as long as no trade association money was used for the
25 purpose ?

MR. STEELEi

There is no question in my mind that

2 if there is not — if the corporation's funds are not used,
3

and that is what I meant in the earlier discussion and it's

4

replete in the 47 history, that individuals volunteering who

5

happen all to be members of a corporation establishing a

6

political action committee, not using corporation’s funds,

7

are not governed by Section 441b.

8

the response is yes, you could have that situation.

9

QUESTION;

So in that sense, I think

So the trade association in your view

10

could use volunteers to solicit funds from anyone,

11

regardless of the permission that was granted.

12

MR. STEELEs

The trade association itself could

13

not, in the sense that because of using volunteers it would

14

be establishing and maintaining that.

15

three prongs to it.

16

financial support, pay for its solicitations, put out the

17

money to put the solicitations out , and pursuant to the

18

Pipefitters case, control these.

19

So there are really

They establish it, maintain it,

Now, if none of those four elements were there, —

20

in other words, if they didn't establish it, didn't maintain

21

it, didn’t finance it, didn't finance its solicitations and

22 didn't control it, it would seem to me you would then have a
23

truly voluntary situation.

But with those four elements

24

there -- and I think any one of those four elements is

25

sufficient, but those are the four major ones — you don’t

1 have a situation where the trade association could use
2 volunteers, because it would have established the separate

\
V

3 segregated fund and maintained, financed and controlled it.
I would note, incidentally, that throughout this

4

5 case there has been no challenge to the basic provisions of
6 441b.

Appellants here have no desire whatsoever to give up

7 the permission of the statute that allows them to do that
8 financially-valuable support.

The trade associations —

9 there's a rising number of political committees in all
10 areas, but particularly in the corporate and trade
11 association area, one finds that in recent years with the
12 development of the law, there has been a vast expansion of
k
1

13 trade associations using their funds to support political
14 committees.
The permission of the statute allowing them to do

15

16 that is very, very valuable to them and is very valuable to
17 the corporation.
QUESTION;

18

I guess we're really concerned about

19 just two things, are we not; the limitation that says you
20 have — that the member corporation has to consent to the
21 solicitation and the restriction limiting it to only one
a

22 trade association per year, isn’t that right?
23

HR. STEELE:

Yes, I think that’s correct, and I

24 think that one of the factors with regard to this case is
25 that this is an area in which Congress, over the course of

1 time, particularly in 1971 and 1976, has come to regulate
2 the area with great precision.

1

¥

There is a very narrow

3 regulation here compared to the historical development, in
4 the sense that the 1907 statute was just what is the
5 beginning of the statute.
6

You now in 1976 the insertion not only of

7 Subsection (D), but of Subsections (A), (B) and (C) , (4)(A),
8 (B), (C) and (D), which spell out with great precision the
9 balance, in terms of the soliciation rights.

And quite

10 frankly, our view is that the corporation's rights to
11 solicit it shareholders and executive and administrative
12 personnel have been here expanded by Section (D).

Thus, the

13 argument from appellant’s side is without Section (D) -1

14 Section (D) was a limitation.

As the court below held and

15 as we have consistently stated, that seems to us not to be
16 so.
17

What you have in Section (D), what Congress did in

18 1976, was to add a broader permission that was brought in
19 front of them that trade associations therefore had very
20 limited solicitation rights, and they came to the result
21 that is now in front of this Court.
22

QUESTIONS

Mr. Steele, if the bottom line that the

23 Congress is aiming at is to limit the contributions and the
V

24 use of these concentrated funds to influence elections, why
25 isn't it enough just to limit the contributions and not

limit solicitation?

Why must you limit the source of funds

2 if you are going to limit the amount of money that can be
3
4
5

given to a candidate or to elections?
MR. STEELE:

Again, I think that goes back to the

history of 610, but that the basic answer to that is that

6 the corporation's expenditure of funds there, the amounts
7

that they are spending for these political committees, makes

8 it part of a specialized structure.
9
10
11

And that there is an

attempt to limit the corporations in spending that money,
that money that they have aggregated through their special QUESTION:

What if you just limit the amount of

12

money that the corporate — just limit the amount of money

13

the corporation can spend on solicitation.

14

to say from whom they may solicit?

15

about is how much of the corporate funds are going to be

16

spent to support the PAC?

17

MR. STEELE:

partly the historical answer that that was the balance that

was struck.

than that, in that Congress in seeing corporations and labor

MR. STEELE;

But they are permitted to spend large

13

amounts, as they are qualified multi-candidate committees,

they can spent $5000 in both the primary and general

election, and there are 460 elections every two years, not

speaking of the presidential.

the amount of funds.

So it allows them to maximize

Indeed, I think one of the arguments --

19

QUESTION;

So you think limiting the sources is a

20 way of limiting the amount of money that they can spend?
21

MR. STEELE;

The limitation that Congress put was a
a

22 limitation on the use of the corporate funds.
23

QUESTION;

Those funds —

That certainly is an indirect way of

24

limiting political contributions, to say that you can only

25

raise your money from X number of people.

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. STEELE;

Well, it doesn't say it as X number of

2 people; it specified —

4 people .
5

MR. STEELE;

And specific categories with whom they

6 have a direct relationship.

7
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Steele, wouldn't you concede that

Justice White's suggestion would be less restrictive than

9 the actual restriction that Congress imposed?
10
11

MR. STEELE;

I would not concede that it was less

restrictive in the sense that the permission of spending the

12 funds — in

other words, if you struck down the entire

13 statute and

started over again, but in effect, you would

14 have then the fact that you would have a limitation on
15 corporations of spending funds for the purposes of
16 solicitation.

The expenditure of those funds for broad base

17 purposes from the corporation's funds would be limited by
18 the other provisions of the statute.
19

But what you have here is a special section which

20 has dealt with corporations and

labor organizations, singled

21 them out as having economic power,

interest in the economic

22 sphere, and that you have a different sphere of regulation
23 for them than you do for political committees.
24

QUESTION;

Do you concede that the right to solicit

25 funds is entitled to heightened

MR. STEELE:

Yes.
And to support the independent fund.
Prior to that, in the corporate area

8

the expenditure of funds for solicitation had never arisen,

9

I think because of a common understanding that the statute

10

barred that kind of expenditure by corporations.

11

Corporations using their funds to go out and raise funds out

12

in the world to contribute to candidates was something that

13

was not done —

limiting the use of corporate funds to just soliciting from

18

the corporation just got control of the fund, that from whom

19

I would think that that would be so,

but that is not — I don't think that is before this Court

22 here.

But the answer would be that that seems to be the

23

effect of the historical development.

That what you have is

24

corporations and labor organizations setting up funds which

25

they do control.

That was, of course, one of the questions

1 that was really brought forth in the Pipefitters case, the
2 question of whether that fund could be controlled by the

3 corporations or, in that instance, by the labor
4 organizations.

The arguments there to begin with were that

5 that fund, one, as a factual matter, that that was not
6 controlled, and this Court effectively said that they didn't

7 need to reach that issue because even if they were
8 controlled, they felt that was within the meaning of the
9 statute.

10

QUESTION;

Mr. Steele, a different question.

11 You've argued in your brief that the proliferation of trade
12 associations and solicitations would undermine the very

13 purpose of the restrictions, as you say, on the use of
14 corporate treasuries.

But isn't that protected already

15 under 441a(a)(5) of the Act?
16

MR. STEELE;

Well, the two provisions -- I don't

17 think it is protected under 441a(a)(5), because quite

18 explicitly -19

QUESTION;

Well, the language is rather explicit,

20 isn't it?
21

MR. STEELE;

The language — and I think the

22 legislative history backs it up -- that Congress was very
23 explicit that they did not want trade associations per se to
24 be deemed affiliated with their members.

What they did in

25 the a(a)(5) sections was to list where they did the

But the legislative

2 history underlying that shows that one of the reasons they

enacted the present section was because in the trade

4

association area, they wanted to allow some solicitation,

listening to the pleas of the trade associations that are

similar to those made here.

Otherwise, we would have a very

14

15

it does not cover the same ground.

It seems to me that the only jurisdictional

basis cited here is 437h, and as I say, except for the --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. STEELE:

The district court to do what?
Well, the district court I think would

24

then have to consider the question that was enumerated in

25

the exchange with Justice White as to whether in this

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

situation you would have 1331 jurisdiction.

We argued to

2 the district court that there was not 1331 jurisdiction on
3

the grounds that Congress had very specifically in this

4

statute set forth the methods for review of the statute

5

437h, 437g, so that therefore there was no 1331 jurisdiction.

6
7

The district court disagreed with that, was then,
in effect, reversed when the 1292 appeal went up on the 437h

8 issue, and so in the present posture of the case the only
9

jurisdiction asserted is the 437h jurisdiction.

10

Again, with regard to the issues, as I say —

11

QUESTION;

Well, do you agree that the plaintiff

12

will be in a position, when it gets back to the district

13

court, to allege and assert 1331 jurisdiction?

14

HR. STEELE;

I certainly think that they would be

15

in a position to assert it.

16

the same reasons that we did before.

17

I think we would oppose it for

Indeed, their original complaint asserted 1331 as a

18

jurisdictional base, but that, as I say, the district court

19

found 1331 jurisdiction and found no 437 h jurisidiction.

20

Appeal taken from that goes up to the court of appeals for

21

the Seventh Circuit, which determine that the jurisdiction

22 lies under 437h, and remands the case to be treated as a
23
24
25

437h case.
QUESTION:

Well, if it goes back to the district

court, they can amend.

the narrow matter of the Subsection (D) here, the basic —

12 and

I think I indicated this in response to Justice

13 Brennan’s question — but the basic congressional interest
14 there was similar to that in the anti-proliferation area.

(D) permits only the solicitation of only one —

16 allows a corporation to allow solicitation of its employees,
17 of its shareholders
18 personnel only by
19 explicit in

and executive and administrative

one trade association, and it is quite

the legislative history that the congressional

20 balancing there, once again, was the limitation of the fact
21

that otherwise, corporations being members of many trade

22 associations would be able to -- you would have a
23 proliferation of the funds available.

And that the basic

24 underlying congressional thrust for this statute was the
25 limitation of those funds.

1

Finally, with regard to the once-a-year provision

2 that Congress has enacted,

that appears to be a provision

3 that is designed to assure that the permission that is
4 granted is one that is not done on a continuing basis; i.e,
5 that the reaffirmation that that is the trade association
6 that the corporation feels that its members can be solicited

7 by is one that is reaffirmed constantly.
8

I would note that it is also one that the

9 Commission, in speaking in its recommendations to Congress,
10 has thought that Congress may want to re-examine as perhaps
11

not being worth the effort.

But it seems to me that as to

12 its basic constitutionality, the underlying basis for it is

13 the same as the overall basis for the 441b(4)(D) to support
14 the 441b(4)(D) provisions altogether.
15

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY COLE, ESE.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

19

MR. COLE;

20 has conceded, as I
21

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

The government

think that it must, that the avowed

purpose of the restraints in Section (D) are to limit the

22 fund-raising potential of trade associations as opposed to

23 all other groups, unions and corporations.
24

This Court, in Buckley, has specifically and

25 unambiguously repudiated that sort of an attempt as being

45

violative of the First Amendment.

The Court there said that

2 attempts to equalize the relativability of individuals in
3

groups to influence the outcome of elections is prohibited.

4

The concept that government may restrict the speech -- and

5

it seems to me a fortiori the associational rights of people

6 — of some elements of society in order to enhance the
7

relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First

8 Amendment.
9

The purposes underlying the Federal Corrupt

10

Practices Act and its successor are twofold.

11

eliminate the actuality and appearance of corruption

12

resulting from large campaign contributions, and equally

13

important as Mr. Justice Powell pointed out in Belotti, as

14

Jr. Justice Frankfurter initially pointed out in the Auto

15

Workers case, indeed as Mr. Justice White pointed out even

16

in his dissent in the Rent Control case against Berkeley, is

17

to preserve the citizens' confidence in government and to

18

actively underwrite and encourage their participation in our

19

Democracy.

20
21

It is to

The restraints of Section (D) make a mockery out of

1 in my view trivializes the First Amendment and makes a
2 mockery out of it.

It goes a giant step towards not

3 advancing, but retarding the goal of citizens* participation
4 and confidence in government.
5

At pages 8 through 13, of our reply brief, we have

6 addressed at some length the question that Mr. Justice
7 Brennan raised about the purposes of the anti-proliferation
8 rules.

And obviously, time simply does not allow me to

9 answer those questions, but I do urge the Court to review
10 those pages.
11

And there is one final point.

I have mis-spoke

12 myself, Mr. Justice Powell, and I want to apologize if I
)

13 did.

I’d like to clarify.

Prior to the 1976 Amendments,

14 trade associations solicited without regard to the
15 restraints imposed now by Section (D), they solicted all
16 those people within the range of affinity of interest
17 without regard to whether they were corporate employees of
18 member corporations, and they did so without obtaining
19 anyone’s prior permission.
20

Those funds that were voluntarily contributed were

21 then expended by the trade association PAC’s in federal
22 elections, consistent with the course of behavior that had
23 gone on for the last 30 or 40 years.

intents and purposes did not exist, and the executives and

19

administrators of our member corporations and stockholders.

recognition by Congress that the only natural and legitimate

people who work for corporations who are our members.
