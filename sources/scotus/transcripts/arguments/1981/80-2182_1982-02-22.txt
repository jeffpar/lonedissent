CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MILTON A. BASS, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BASS;

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
In this dispute between generic manufacturing

11
12

companies and brand name companies, the generic

13

manufacturers are seeking to get a larger share of the

14

drug industry, of the drug market.

15

companies are seeking to retain or increase their

16

dominant position in the prescription drug market.

17

has been variously reported that they have approximately

18

90 percent of the prescription drug market at this time.

19

What the brand name companies are asking, what

The brand name

they’re asking for the Court to give them is a monopoly

22

advantage, and that’s why we are here.

23

They’re asking this for a competitive

Both sides in this dispute claim they speak in

24

the public interest.

We believe that our position

25

weighs more heavily in the public interest than that of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
OA"iA/ ,f«Aor

1

the brand name companies.
If the brand name companies are given a

2
3

monopoly on color, I respectfully submit they will be

4

able to use that advantage for unfair competition

5

whether or not it is found by this Court that there is

6

functionality present.
The question of whether there is functionality

7

8

will depend upon the definition that this Court lays

9

down.

But irrespective of whether there is a fact of

10

functionality, even then I believe it will be used to

11

the great advantage of the brand name companies and to

12

the disadvantage of the generic companies for this

13

reason.
The Respondent and the PSA, the association

14
15

that represents the brand name companies, have submitted

16

briefs to this Court, and they have said to this Court

17

color serves no function other than to deceive the

18

consumer.

19

get the color monopoly they seek.

They have said that to this Court in order to

20

But when they speak outside of this Court,

21

they do not say color has no purpose or no function.

22

the contrary, we have found that one company, for

23

example, issued a document to its salesmen for

24

discussion with physicians to convince them that they

25

should prescribe the brand name product and not the

they told the courts, color has no function; they said

become concerned that it’s been changed.

consuming.

10

And they said — they didn't say what

They'll require additional checks.

confusion and additional effort will result.

11

How, that's —

12

QUESTION*

Isn't there a statute involved in

14

MR. BASS;

A statute?

15

QUESTION:

The Lanham Act?

16

MR. BASS*

Yes, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION*

On that point, Mr. Bass, aren't we

13

this case?

18

really concerned with whether there is a Section 32 of

19

the Lanham Act violation?

20

MR. BASS*

Correct.

21

QUESTION*

We're not concerned properly, are

22

23

we, with the 43a question, would you agree?
MR. BASS*

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

24

case comes up on an alleged violation of Section 32, and

25

more precisely, whether the defendant manufacturers are

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

guilty of contributory liability or contributory

2

violative conduct.

3

But I would respectfully submit, Your Honor,

4

the question of functionality is essential, in my view,

5

to a consideration of this problem because when these

6

cases have been presented in the district courts, in the

7

lower courts, that is the argument that has been

8

presented to the court time and time again:

9

no purpose except to deceive.

color has

And I believe that is the

10

reason we’re here today; that the lower courts have

11

accepted that proposition.

12

And therefore, with due respect, I merely wish

13

to point out that no matter what Your Honor decides is

14

the definition of functionality, well, I believe this

15

itself is functionality, that our ability to effectively

16

compete — I'm not saying we cannot compete — to

17

effectively compete will be damaged if they can say to

18

the doctor do not prescribe the generic because you’ll

19

cause confusion, mistake, error, patient resistance,

20

whether that's true or not, even though we will submit,

21

as I will discuss now, it is true.

22

So that the strict legal question. Your Honor,

23

you are correct, is are we guilty of contributory

24

violative conduct.

25

QUESTION;

But I -Shouldn't we focus on what standard

6

1

of review the Court of Appeals invoked in reviewing the

2

District Court findings?

3

MR. BASSs

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that

4

must be done, and I can do it now, or I intended to

5

address it.

6

The reason I wanted to —

QUESTION*

It just seemed to me that maybe a

7

lot of time was spent in the briefs arguing something

8

that we wouldn't end up resolving if we stuck to the

9

question that we were supposed to resolve.

10

MR. BASS*

Kell, that is true, Your Honor, but

11

there is one other factor that is relevant.

Inherent in

12

applying the standard that the Second Circuit discussed

13

both in Ives II and Ives IV, both the first decision

14

written by Judge Friendly and the second by Judge

15

Mansfield, one of the rules laid down is that you will

16

find contributory liability if you suggest even by

17

implication that you should commit illegal substition or

18

mislabeling.

19

mentioned was if you continue to sell to someone you

20

know is illegally committing these acts.

The second part that Judge Friendly

21

In discussing the question of whether you come

22

within the first prong of that rule, if that is the rule

23

this Court should adopt, that if you suggest even by

24

implication, whether or not there is functionality

25

becomes relevant, separate and apart even from the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

question of relief.

But even liability itself will

2

hinge on whether there is a complete absence of

3

functionality.
And the reason why the Respondent and the

4
5

other briefers make great moment of that question is

6

precisely because I believe they cannot sustain any

7

position unless they can convince this Court that color

8

serves no purpose.

9

then lost their basic position to get a color monopoly,

If color serves a purpose, they have

10

because that is what they are saying to the Court

11

constituted the suggestion.
How, I will. Your Honor, be happy to address

12
13

it right now.

14

standards we're using are twofold — either you suggest

15

even by implication that you should commit the wrongful

16

act, or you continue selling — he said also he was

17

adopting Judge Wyzanski’s discussion and rule in the

18

Coca-Cola-Snow Crest case.

19

decision in which the majority opinion was written by

20

Judge Mansfield, he said he was applying that rule, and

21

to come within that rule he said there were a number of

22

factors.

23

said there were catalogs and price lists which compared

24

prices and mentioned the color of both products.

25

When Judge Friendly in Ives II said the

When it came to the Ives IV

He said the color, which was the same.

He

its brief in this case, it did not adopt what Judge

2

Mansfield said, even though he ruled in their favor.

3

They are trying to contend and argue that color alone,

4

color alone comes within the rule to constitute the

5

suggestion.

6

Honor, twofold;

7

adopted; and secondly, that this Court of Appeals did

8

not properly apply the rule in terms of showing that

9

there was compliance with the requirement laid down in

10

And I would respectfully submit, Your
first, that is not a proper rule to be

Ives II, if that is the rule this Court agrees with.

11

Because when Ives II came before the Court of

12

Appeals, the court effectively said color is not enough

13

to constitute a suggestion by implication or otherwise

14

that you should commit an illegal act, violate the

15

criminal code because we sell it in the same color.

16

because if that were adequate, the Court would not have

17

sent it back and said a trial will have further evidence

18

to see what each side can introduce to try to come

19

within or negate compliance with that rule of liability.

20

And in that regard I would like to point out

21

what is relevant and significant.

When Judge Friendly

sent the case back for trial, he said you’ve give us 15

instances of illegal substitution.

5

And what did they do when they came back with

the additional evidence?

They did not conduct a study,

which Judge Friendly asked them to do, to try to show

8

more extensive illegal substitution.

there was an indictment against six pharmacists for

direction of the Court of Appeals, was on legal

And, Your Honors, I respectfully ask how can

QUESTION;

means legal as a matter of state law, don't you?

12

MR. BASS;

That’s correct.

And, Your Honor --

13

2UESTI0N;

Well, but the fact that it's legal

14

as a matter of state law doesn’t necessarily mean there

15

was no infringement or unfair competition, does it?

16

MB. BASS;

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But what I

17

am suggesting is this;

they are trying to put in

18

evidence to prove that the manufacturer is guilty of

19

contributory trademark infringement, and they are trying

20

to do it by saying the manufacturer sells his product to

21

the pharmacist in the same color.

telling him you commit the wrongful act of writing their

name on your label to the consumer.

1

QUESTION:

The only thing I'm suggesting is I

2

don't think your argument turns on whether — the mere

3

fact that there was legal substitution isn't what's

4

critical.

5

or not sufficient knowledge of the likelihood of

6

deception or something of that character.

7
8
9

The fact is that there was no wrongful intent

HR. BASS:

Yes.

There has to be a showing or

proof of culpability on the part of the manufacturer.
QUESTION:

But I mean that could exist even

10

though the substitution was lawful.

11

me you're emphasizing a point that is not critical to

12

your argument.

13

MR. BASS:

It just seemed to

It is conceivable or. theoretically

14

possible, Your Honor, but I think it would be rather

15

difficult to conceive of a generic company acting with

16

guilty intent or wrongful intent or have any thought of

17

wanting to tell the pharmacist by any means — by

18

telegram, letter, or using the same color here as

19

they're claiming — to go and commit a trademark

20

infringement when I*m selling a product for a legal

21

sale, and it's being sold legally.

22

Their theory, Your Honor, was originally that

23

an illegal substitution — the pharmacist is palming off

24

my product -- so they're saying the manufacturer is

25

trying to get more sales to have his product substituted

illegally.

That was their theory, reading into his mind

2

that state of mind.
And I'm suggesting for whatever reason they

3
4

had, they didn't go out and try to prove more extensive

5

illegal substitution, which Ives II court found no

6

showing of any moment.
But I appear. Your Honors, not primarily to

7
8

say to you it was applied incorrectly, which I believe

9

the case was decided incorrectly —

10

QUESTION;

Mr. Bass.

11

MR. BASS;

Yes, sir.

12

QUESTION;

May I ask you a factual question?

13

Are the four drug manufacturers that are here in this

14

case the only ones who market this particular drug?

15

MR. BASS;

No, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION;

How many others are there?

17

MR. BASS;

We don't have the exact figure of

18

pharmacists.

There's been an estimate of approximately

19

100,000 users, maybe 25,000 pharmacists.

20

QUESTION;

I'm asking —

21

MR. BASS;

I mean doctors.

22

QUESTION;

case.

Are there others in the United States that market

QUESTION:

6

MR. BASS:

The only one I know of, there’s a

8

don’t — there would be some others. Your Honor.

9

not certain of which others.

I’m

Incidentally, I must amend, though, the

10
11

answer, sir.

In this case two of — the two

12

manufacturers, Premo and In wood, are not presently

13

manufacturing it pending the decision of this case.
QUESTION:

14

So there are only two parties

15

before the Court that are presently manufacturing this

16

drug?

17

MR. BASS:

Ives, yes, that I know of.

18

Actually it’s Ives basically would be the one

19

manufacturer.

20

QUESTION:

Do you know whether the company in

21

Georgia that you mentioned markets the drug with the

22

same color and shape distinctions that you are

23

discussing?

24
25

MR. BASS:

No, they do not.

They use a red

MR. BASS;

11

The purpose of identical colors,

12

Your Honor, is to maximize the ability to compete.

example —

14

QUESTION;

One

Does that mean the purpose is to

15

cause the public to think, that they're produced by the

16

same manufacturer?

17

MR. BASS;

No, sir.

18

QUESTION;

Why not?

19

MR. BASS;

The purpose is to make them think

20

it's the same drug, not the same manufacturer.

The

21

purpose — I'll have to use plural, Your Honor, if I

22

may, with due respect — the first purpose I tried to

23

refer to is that if we do not make it in the same color,

24

they go to the doctors, who is the purchaser here, who

25

prescribes the product, as I mentioned earlier, and they

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

say color is important; you'd better prescribe my

2

product or otherwise there will be problems and

3

confusion.
Second, doctors say that.

4

There was an amicus

5

brief by an organization of doctors who also said to

6

this Court color isn't important.

7

their own papers here, they say in a poll in Florida

8

there were 99 percent of the people who said if they had

a different color they'd call their doctor, and they

But that's the key to the issue.

Now, take Ives.

When Ives sells its products,

it really doesn't use color as a source.

one product in blue, one in orange, one in yellow, and

15

one in green; and it says each color says I am Ives.

that says each color is — I am Lily.

It puts out

Is that a rational way to try to identify me

21

If they want to put on that capsule a blue star which

then they advertise says I am an Ives product on all

23

their products, I think they're right and should do it

24

QUESTION;

I'd like to explain why.

Hhat's the Government's interest in

this case?
MR. GANZFRIED;This case presents important

18

questions as to federal competition policy, on the one

19

hand between the policy favoring product imitation,

20

which will ultimately hopefully allow for reduced prices

21

to consumers; and on the other hand, the federal policy

22

favoring competition by product differentiation.

It is certainly one aspect of the federal

How, in this case the only trademark that’s

10

involved is the name Cyclospasmol, and any claim of

11

infringement under Section 32 must be rooted in the

misuse of that particular word.

13

central fact in the case in mind, we approach the issues

14

presented under the legal standard described by Judge

Friendly in the first appeal in this case and nominally

applied by the majority in the second appeal.

Keeping this as a

Now, that standard that Judge Friendly

announced has been referred to by counsel.

that the problem with the majority's opinion on the

Now, as to the question of what the Court of

evidence of trademark infringement by a small number of

retail druggists.

However, the record is absent any

10

proof that the Petitioners in fact suggested or implied

11

this course of conduct to the druggists.

12

contrary, the record does support, and the District

bottles only with the generic name cyclandelate, never

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARIE V. DRISCOLL, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. DRISCOLL;

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I think I, too, should begin with informing

5
6

the Court just why we are here today and why the finding

7

of contributory trademark infringement was in fact

8

clearly supportable on the record.
I have lodged with the Clerk of Court, and you

9
10

may wish to look at what actually is involved in this

11

case.

12

defendants -- and this an exhibit in the record — had

13

tens of thousands of color combinations from which to

14

select, and they selected exactly the same colors when

15

they decided to sell generic cyclandelate.

We have vivid blue capsules made by Ives.

16

QUESTION;

17

MS.

18

For the same content?

DRISCOLL; The same active

ingredient,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

19
20

The

ingredient.

The same -- well, active

The same total content?

21

MS.

DRISCOLL; There is not at

issue

in this

22

case, because

we did not raise an issue,

as to what in

23

addition to the active ingredient they may have in their

24

product.

25

to whether the binders and excipients are the same.

That has been involved in some other cases as
But

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

we have not claimed in this case that for purposes of,

2

for example, the substitution law in New York which is

3

involved, that these products are not in fact equivalent.

4

QUESTION;

The capsule is the same size?

5

NS. DRISCOLL;

The capsules are exactly the

6

same size, and the defendants' capsules, to make things

7

even worse, are completely, or were at the beginning of

8

this suit, completely anonymous.

9

at depositions looked at their capsules, and they

10

couldn't tell where there product came from.
QUESTION;

Did you say, Ms. Driscoll, copies

of that are around here?

MS. DRISCOLL;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

16

though, wasn't it?

18

that.

19

I had ten facsimiles

They could have their own name on it.
MS. DRISCOLL;

They have -- well, you will

20

see, Your Honor, also that I have included in the upper

21

righthand samples of their capsules which have markings

22

on it, the names or MDC number; and in each case - and

23

there have been many cases brought recently involving

24

the duplication of color of prescription drug capsules

25

— it's been held that the imprint is so small — and I

think the Court will agree
QUESTION*

2

it is so small

Well, but isn't it your legal

3

position that even if the imprint were large, you would

4

still make the same claim about their using the color?

5

NS. DRISCOLL:

QUESTION*

7

So now why are you arguing that

it's significant that it's not legible.

Now, if it comes in a different color, do you

say that creates no problem, psychological or whatever,

for the patient?

No.

There has been extensive

13

And while the patients may inquire and may say

14

I notice why is this green this month, it's always been

QUESTION:

Well, would you agree that there’s

a difference between the patient in the hospital and the

11

patient taking a medication long-term at home without

constant medical guidance; that is, there’s a nurse or

explain the change.

That’s true.

QUESTION:

That’s right.

Do you acknowledge that there is a

20

difference, that it’s more readily explained to the

21

patient in the hospital than it is to the other patient?

22

MS. DRISCOLL;

Well, there are more people to

23

explain it.

Once the explanation is made I'm not sure

24

it’s more readily accepted one place or another.

25

doesn’t seem to be a distinction on that.

QUESTION*

4

Ms. Driscoll, you're arguing the

5

facts, which I think you're really entitled to do, but

6

you started out by saying you thought there was -- or

7

early in your argument you said you thought there was

8

support in the record for the finding that there was a

9

Section 32 violation.

10

MS. DRISCOLL*

about, the Court of Appeals?

QUESTION:

15

Well, the District Court had found

16

no Section 32 violation and had a series of factual

17

findings.

Did the Court of Appeals set aside any of the

19

MS. DRISCOLL*

20

QUESTION*

21
22

Yes.

And did it do so on a clearly

erroneous standard or not?
MS. DRISCOLL:

While the Court of Appeals did

23

not specifically use the words "clearly erroneous," it

24

would be a matter of semantics to say that it was not

25

applying such a standard, because the Court of —

Well, you agree that it should

MS. DRISCOLL:

And that it did, yes, because

it said, for example, on the question of the mislabeling

5

that occurred, there was no support —

6

QUESTION:

Well, you’re not suggesting that

7

the Court of Appeals was free to arrive at its own

independent finding?

9

MS. DRISCOLL:

No, I’m not suggesting that,

nor do I believe it did.

MS. DRISCOLL:

MS. DRISCOLL*

It appeared on both the motion

MS. DRISCOLL*

The District Court, yes.

not specifically use the word "intent," but in

determining whether or not Section 32 has been violated

and whether there's been a trademark, infringement,

intentional copying of the color, the intentional hiding

With respect to this whole subject,

could I focus your attention specifically to the

20

21

that it has no secondary meaning in these

22

circumstances.

23

that the District Court clearly erred in making that

24

finding?

What is there in the record to suggest

KS. DRISCOLLi

If the record is reviewed, and

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I'll take first the function record, the record on

2

whether this is functional or not, we have a situation

3

where it's undisputed that the drug in question is a

4

white powder.

5

back to the normal standards of what function means.

Color has nothing to do with it, if we go

Initially, Ives could have made this drug in

7

any color.

It, for a purely arbitrary reason, chose the

8

9

functionality, and that is undisputed, and I believe

So there is no inherent

10

even the District Court admitted that there's no

11

inherent functionality.

12

Judge Friendly on the first appeal agreed that

13

this was arbitrary, had no relationship to the

14

underlying drug, and indicated that whether or not the

15

colors had become functional, had somehow acquired

16

functionality, would depend on proof offered by the

17

defendants.

18

Now, if you look at the proof offered by the

19

defendants, you find that there are three physicians who

20

testified before the defendants; and I'm assuming now

21

that although there was no finding as to credibility,

22

we'll eliminate completely all the plaintiffs' evidence

23

on this, but let’s just look at what the defendant put

24

in on functionality through its physicians.

25

They all agreed that there are many non-look

experience with them; that if their patients inquire why

is there a color change, the patient accepts the

4

explanation for the color change.

5

seas approximately a thousand patients a year and has

6

practiced for 16 years — that's the defendant's Dr.

15

that.

16

In other words, if you say

want to change the source of their medication; and it

factor in whether institutional sales can be made.

QUESTION;

11

Ms. Driscoll, may I ask a question

12

about the examples of infringement on page 10 of your

13

brief?

14

primarily was that the retail druggist would use the

15

name Cyclospasmol and then put something additional that

16

was a little bit ambiguous, like they might put the word

17

"generic" or "gen" or something like that, and those are

18

examples of the infringement of which you primarily

19

complain.

20

As I understand it, the thing you objected to

Yes.

There are several types.

Color is critical because it

in fact dispensing cheaper products in filling

Is

Either that. Your Honor, yes,

at those infringements in a few ways.

which there have been many recently, that there is a

QUESTION*

1

I meant to ask you also, if I

2

could, is it your view that any time the word

3

"Cyclospasmol" is used on the label there's an

4

infringement?

5

this product is a generic equivalent to Cyclospasmol; he

6

spelled it all out.

Supposing, for example, a druggist said

Would that —

MS. DRISCOLL;

7

No.

I would have to take the

8

position that if there were a clear and unequivocal

9

statement like that, there would not be an infringement

10

because there would not be a chance of misunderstanding.
QUESTION;

11

Well, supposing in each of these

12

cases where you just have the "Gen," say the druggist

13

had explained; he said you understand, don't you, the

14

doctor said we can substitute, and that's what we've

15

done?

16

MS. DRISCOLL;

Well, that would put us once

17

again at the mercy of the pharmacists.

In the

18

particular shoppings we did the only reason the

19

pharmacist disclosed anything to the shoppers that went

20

in was that our shoppers were instructed as part of the

21

survey instructions to ask whether or not a generic had

22

been dispensed.

23

which prescription drugs reach the public and because of

24

the fact that the pharmacists are passing off these

25

look-alikes, we do not want to be in a position where we

are relying on the good faith of the pharmacists,

because we see this problem already.
QUESTION:

3

Well, I understand that, but I'm

4

not clear what your answer to my question was.

Supposing that the pharmacist says this is a generic

6

equivalent to Cyclospasmol, and he just has the writing,

7

you say.

MS. DRISCOLL:

8
9

Would that be infringement then?
Well, the person receiving the

bottle presumably would not be confused, and to that

10

extent there would be no infringement; but anyone else

11

who saw the bottle, for example, such as the physician

12

should something have gone wrong with the product and

13

the patient said this doesn't seem to be working the

14

same way, here's my bottle, to that extent anyone else

15

who saw labeling like that would in fact —

MS. DRISCOLL:

6

No.

See, the physician is in

an unusual circumstance in most states, Your Honor.

In

8

most states substitution is not mandatory so that when a

9

physician, for example, writes a prescription and

10

indicates that a generic can be dispensed, that does not

11

mean that the pharmacist must dispense a generic.
QUESTION;

12

Well, I know, but isn't he like the

13

manufacturer putting the druggist in a position to pass

14

off?

MS. DRISCOLL:

No, he's not, because he is not

patient is fooled.

QUESTION:

his instructions, the doctor has quite a bit of control.
MS. DRISCOLL:

If his instructions are

whether his instructions are followed because he is
