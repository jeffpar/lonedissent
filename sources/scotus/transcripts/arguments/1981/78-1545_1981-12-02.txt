ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. JOLLEY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 80-951

7

MR. JOLLEYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8the Court, the decision of the Seventh Circuit at issue in
90-951 affirms a district court order approving a settlement
lOagreement between defendant, TWA, and plaintiffs who were
11 former TWA employees.
12

Pursuant to that settlement, plaintiffs were

I3granted full union or competitive seniority, despite the
14fact that the Seventh Circuit had previously decided that
15plaintiffs had failed to establish a violation of Title 7,
I6despite the fact that TWA objected -- excuse me, despite the
17fact that IFFA, the incumbent union, objected to that
18settlement, and despite the fact that the settlement
19overrides the seniority provisions of IFFA's collective
20bargaining agreement with TWA.

21

From at least the effective date of the Civil

22Rights Act of 1964, and up until October of 1970, TWA
23maintained a policy of terminating all flight attendants who
24became mothers.

On May 30th, 1970, the first charge was

25filed with the EEOC challenging this practice.

In August of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 1970, this litigation was brought against TWA as a class
2action purportedly on behalf of all flight attendants
3 terminated under that policy since July 2, 1965.
4

In 1976, the district court granted partial

5summary judgment againts TWA, holding that its policy was
6indeed a violation of Title 7, and also that all claims were
7 timely because TWA had engaged in a continuing violation.
8 In 1978, however, the Seventh Circuit vacated that order in
9a decision known as the consolidated opinion.

The Seventh

lOCircuit held that TWA's policy was indeed unlawful, but that
11 there was no continuing violation, and that the claims of 92
I2percent of the plaintiff class were therefore untimely
13 pursuant to former Section 706(d), the 90-day time filing
14 requirement.
15

Plaintiffs contended before the Seventh Circuit at

16that time that TWA had nevertheless waived any timeliness
17defenses.

The Seventh Circuit in its opinion expressed

18doubt as to any waiver by TWA, but ruled that the time
I9filing limit is a jurisdictional prerequisite which in any
20event is not subject to waiver by TWA.

21

Plaintiffs and TWA thereupon filed petitions for

22certiorari in Cases Number 78-1545 and 78-1549.

It is

23important to note that plaintiffs in seeking — in filing
24their petition for certiorari did not seek review of the
25Seventh Circuit holding that there was no continuing

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 violation, anti it should be remembered that this was the
2basis for the district court’s order granting summary
3 judgment.
4

In June, 1979, while those petitions for

5certiorari were pending, TWA and the plaintiffs entered into
6a settlement agreement.
7

QUESTION:

Counsel, what do you think the Seventh

8Circuit’s definition of a "continuing violation" is?
9

MR. JOLLEY:

Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit in

lOits opinion considered this Court's decision in Evans, and
11 relying in part upon the decision in Evans concluded that
12where there is a termination of employment, a permanent
I3severing of the employment relationship, it is that act that
14starts the statute running, as opposed to a layoff situation
I5where employees maintain a continued link to their job or to
16their employment, and TWA's refusal in the succeeding years
I7after the terminations beginning in 1965 to rehire is not in
I8the Seventh Circuit’s opinion a continuing violation.

The

19violation was the act of termination.

20

The settlement agreement entered into by TWA and

21 the plaintiffs in this case divided the plaintiffs into two
22subclasses,

Subclass A consisting of the 8 percent,

23approximately 30 in number, who according to the Seventh
24Circuit had valid timely claims; Subclass B consisting
25exclusively of the 92 percent, exceeding 400 plaintiffs in

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Inumber, whose claims are time barred according to the
2Seventh Circuit.
3

Under the agreement, TWA agrees to pay each

4 subclass $1.5 million to be apportioned among the respective
5subclasses.

The settlement also contains a non-admission

6clause regarding TWA’s liability and a provision stating
7 that the settlement supersedes past, present, and future
8 collective bargaining agreements.
9

Host importantly, the settlement provided that all

10class members would be offered re-employment and may obtain
11 full competitive seniority to be awarded by the district
l2court "in its discretion pursuant to the provisions of
l3Section 706(g) and all other applicable provisions of law
l4without contest or objection by TWA."
15

IFFA, the incumbent union, intervened, and its

I6objections to the district court's jurisdiction, to the
17approval of the settlement agreement, and to an award
I8granting seniority were all overruled by the district
l9court.

On appeal, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the

20seniority grant on the basis of this Court's decision in
21 Franks versus Bowman, and rejected IFFA's jurisdictional
22challenge on the rationale that the policy favoring
23voluntary settlements outweighs its lack of jurisdiction,
24even though the Seventh Circuit left undisturbed its

25Previous holding that the time limit is jurisdictional.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

IFFA stands before the Court today because

2valuable contract rights, indeed, its most cherished and
3important contract rights, previously bargained away to IFFA
4by TWA through the collective bargaining process, and
5therefore belonging to IFFA, have been taken from IFFA and
6given to the plaintiffs.
7

Under the Railway Labor Act, not only is IFFA

8entitled to determine for itself the collective bargaining
9process, what changes to make in the collective bargaining
lOagreement, what provisions to try to include or to include
11 in a collective bargaining agreement, it is also entitled to
12compliance by TWA with its Railway Labor Act obligation to
13deal exclusively with IFFA, and with no other, not only in
I4setting but in changing the terms and conditions of
l5employment, which includes seniority.
16

This Court has previously acknowledged the

17overriding importance in today's economic system of
18seniority systems.

19

QUESTION*

Are you going to — you are going to

20get to the jurisdictional matter, the time matter?

Or are

21 you arguing that?

22

MR. JOLLEYs

Your Honor, we certainly are not

23waiving the jurisdictional question.

We want to address

24primarily the grant of seniority, because we believe there
25is absolutely no foundation for a grant of seniority in the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 circumstances of this case.
2

QUESTION;

Kell, what if we affirm the court of

3appeals' holding that it was a jurisdictional requirement,
4and then held also that the district court could not enter a
5settlement with respect to 92 percent of the plaintiffs?
6

MR. JOLLEY»

7

QUESTION»

Your Honor, we would be very happy.
Well, I know.

It seems to me that it

8 is a jurisdictional question, isn’t it?
9
10

MR. JOLLEY»
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, it is.
Well, you don't even get to your issue

11 if the jurisdictional issue is decided in your favor.
12

MR. JOLLEY»

Your Honor, ordinarily I know that

13 the Court first addresses jurisdictional questions to
14 determine the -15

QUESTION*

You go your own way, but you are just

16going to leave us on our own?
17

MR. JOLLEY*

Well, that is the issue that is

18raised in Number 1545, which is the other case
19consolidated.

That precise issue is before the Court.

We

20do not believe -21

QUESTION»

Yes, but you --

22

MR. JOLLEY*

Your Honor, we do not believe, first

23of all, that a district court whose own court of appeals has
24stated that there is no jurisdiction, has the jurisdiction
25even to approve a settlement agreement.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

All right.

Well/ you go ahead and

2argue your case the way you want to.
3

MR. JOLLEY*

As this Court has previously

4indicated, competitive seniority rights determine the
5allocation between competing employees to scarce employment
6benefits, and indeed determine who gets and who keeps an
/available job.

In our brief, I think we have detailed that

8these remarks are even more appropriate to flight attendants
9by the nature of their job.

The nature of the rights that

lOhave been taken from IFFA in this case are highlighted by
11 the fact that since 1979, when IFFA intervened in the
I2settlement of this action, hundreds of flight attendants
I3have been furloughed, have not been recalled, and since the
l4collective bargaining agreement would be superseded by the
15settlement agreement between plaintiffs and TWA, their
l6contractual right to recall within a period of three years,
I7which is a part of the current collective bargaining
18seniority system, will be deprived by the grant of greater
l9seniority to the plaintiffs in this case.
20

QUESTION*

Nr. Jolley, will you agree that the

2lagreement as to Subclass A also overrode the bargaining
22 agreement?

23
240'Connor.
25

MR. JOLLEY*

No question about it, Justice

It did override.
QUESTION*

Well, then, why is the union failing to

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 object to the portion of the agreement which applies to
2Subclass A?
3

HR. JOLLEY:

Your Honor, the union has chosen, as

4 is its right to do, in a sense to agree by not objecting
5 because plaintiffs in Subclass A have come close to carrying
6 their burden required by Franks in order to demonstrate even
7 the possibility of an entitlement to rightful place.

IFFA

8has made a judgment, as in fact courts have done, that those
9 who file timely claims are in a different position than
10those who have not, and even though the question of TWA's
11 violation as to Subclass A is pending before this Court, the
12 jurisdictional infirmity does not exist as to Subclass A,
13 and for that reason we have chosen, as is our right, to not
I4base our objections on the competitive seniority grant to
l5Subclass A members.
16

QUESTION:

Would you also agree that the seniority

17system itself really was not affected by the settlement
18agreement?

It was a question of who was plugged in where,

I9but it didn't change the seniority system itself.
20

HR. JOLLEY:

No, Your Honor.

The settlement

21 agreement itself states that the seniority agreement is
22superseded.

Moreover, the provision of the agreement which

23states that flight attendants who are terminated or

who

24resign forfeit all their seniority, that is an integral part
25of the seniority system, because it is that provision which

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 allows incumbent employees once they have a job to move up
2and become more entitled to the scarce employment benefits,
3and that provision has been superseded, and that is integral
4 to the functioning of the entire seniority system.
5

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question while

61 have you responding right now, and that is whether IFFA is
7 not bound by the actions of the union which did represent
8the plaintiffs when the action was filed.
9

MR. JOLLEY*

I don’t believe --

10

QUESTION*

And if not, why not?

11

MR. JOLLEY*

Well, Number One, that question has

I2never been raised, and I believe that before there can be a
13granting of seniority that belongs to IFFA, that IFFA has a
14right under due process to litigate that issue, and Number
15Two,

there has — we are not bound.

That would require us

l6to be a legal successor, which we denied, and again, that
I7has not been litigated, and the actions of the early union
I8in 1971, they entered into a settlement agreement which in
igfact was based upon the jurisdictional infirmities of 92
20percent of the plaintiff class.

And our position is

21 consistent with the position of the union at that time in
22that regard.
23

I am running out of time, and I would like to

24conclude by indicating that under our system of laws, there
25are only two ways in which property which belongs to one

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

party can be granted to another .

2 proposition.

It is a simple

Property that belongs to me can be given away

3 by my consent, or it can be taken from me after a litigation
4 which results in a finding of a legal wrong which entitles
5 someone to my property after I have had the opportunity to
6 defend myself and to attempt to prove that there has been no

7 such legal wrong.

There has been no voluntary settlement in

8 this case.

IFFA has not agreed to the grant of its

9 seniority.

TWA and the plaintiffs have entered into a

10

settlement, and to the extent that TWA offered what was

11 TWA's to give, and
12

that the plaintiffs offered what was the

plaintiff's to give, that is a settlement.

13 mutuality of consideration.
14 a settlement as to IFFA.

That has

That is voluntary.

That is not

It is not a settlement as to the

15 seniority rights.
16

QUESTION*

You don't claim that IFFA isn't bound

17 by Title 7, do you?
18

MR. JOLLEY*

Oh, absolutely not.

19 remedial scheme which binds — binds IFFA.
20 affirmative provisions which bind IFFA.
21

Title 7 has -- a
It has

But it also has

Section 706(g), which states in clear terms that upon a

22 finding of the commission of an unlawful employment

23 practice, upon a finding of a violation of Title 7, the
24 Court may enjoin that practice and may award affirmative
25 relief.

And there has been no such required finding.

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

3

QUESTION:

Well, what about Class A?

Was there a

4 finding of violation with respect to them?

MR. JOLLEY:

5

Your Honor, there was a finding in

6 the 1976 order of summary judgment.

That judgment was

7 reversed as to Subclass B because of the -- violation.
8

QUESTION:

9

There is a finding, but that is up

before the Court at this time on certiorari in 1549.

It was what?
I do not believe that the grant of

QUESTION:

MR. JOLLEY:

Oh, it was deferred.

That's right.

-- in 1549 is deferred.

It is still

19 before the court.
20
21

QUESTION:

That's right.

But if that were — if

that finding of -- where do you stand if that finding of

22 violation is left standing?
23

MR. JOLLEY:

As to Subclass A, we haven't objected

24 at this point.
25

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but there is a finding of

1 violation
2

MR. JOLLEY*

But only as to Subclass A, and

3 Subclass A cannot bootstrap otherwise invalid claims.

The

4class action procedures are only a device for consolidating
5claims which are otherwise properly before the Court.
6

QUESTION*

What did the district court find?

7

MR. JOLLEY*

8

QUESTION:

In which action, Your Honor?
With respect to Subclass B.

Did the

9district court find a violation?
10

MR. JOLLEY:

The district — the only order of a

11 violation was the 1976 summary judgment granted -12

QUESTION:

Right.

13

MR. JOLLEY*

— summary judgment grant, which was

Mbased on the continuing violation -15

QUESTION*

Yes, with respect to the entire class.

16

MR. JOLLEY:

— which was — to the Seventh

17 Circuit.
18

QUESTION*

19

MR. JOLLEY*

With respect to the entire class.
At least by inference to Subclass B.

20There is a finding of a violation that the policy was

21 discriminatory, and that Subclass A members were the subject
22of a timely claim, and I believe that ruling has been left
23intact, subject to the writ of certiorari that has been
24granted in this case or held in abeyance by the court in

25 1549.

Yes.

11

MR. JOLLEY*

IFFA intervened for purposes of

l2objecting to the district court's jurisdiction, and
13objecting to the settlement, and objecting to the grant of
14 seniority.
15

QUESTION;

You made the same arguments then that

16you are making here today.
17

MR. JOLLEY;

We did. Your Honor, and the right to

I8be heard in that proceeding is not the right that is
I9guaranteed to us under the due process clause to litigate in
20the first place whether there has been a finding of a

2lviolation to litigate the merits.

There has been no

22determination on the merits that TWA has violated the law
23under Title 7, and therefore there is no basis for exerting

24706(g) remedial powers, and there has been no settlement.
25

I would like to reserve my remaining time for

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

argument -- for rebuttal if there are no further questions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jolley, may I ask you one more

3

question before you do?

4

between employees currently represented in an employment

5

situation and others such as the ones who were formerly

Is there a necessary conflict

6 discharged who want rightful place relief?
7

KR . JOLLEY;

8 there is a conflict.

First of all, Justice O'Connor, yes,
There are conflicts often times in

9 collective bargaining even between one group of present
10

employees and another covered by the same collective

11

bargaining agreement, and as this Court has held on numerous

12

occasions going back to Steel versus Louisville, et cetera,

13

the collective bargaining representative has the authority

14

so long as it acts in good faith as a part of its collective

15

bargaining rule to resolve those conflicts, but yes, there

16 is a conflict.
17

However, this is not a rightful place case.

18

Rightful place is a term under Franks which arises only

19

after there is a finding of a violation.

This Court in both

20 Evans and Hardison made that point crystal clear.
21

This is

not a rightful place case, certainly not as to Subclass B.

22 There has been no determination of a right

to that place.

23

It is a settlement agreement which the holder of the right

24

did not enter into, and on that basis it cannot stand.

25

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Randolph.

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 78-15145

4

MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5please the Court, I represent the plaintiff class in this
6case, and I would like to first address myself to a number
7of the arguments that Mr. Jolley has just made on behalf of
8 the union and also in his reply brief, and then address the
9question that Mr. Justice White raised with respect to
10 jurisdiction.
11

There was and has been no absence of union

12 participation in this litigation in the eleven-year history
13of the case.

As Justice O'Connor pointed out, this case was

I4begun by the union.

There was a complaint filed by the

15union after the union brought a charge before the EEOC in
161970.

There came a time, three years after the litigation

17was under way, that the court of appeals decided that the
18union could no longer represent the class that I now
I9represent because of a conflict of interest, but the union
20was

not ousted from the litigation.

The original union

21 remained in this case until 1976 as a party, participated in
22the pleadings, filed motions in opposition to summary
23judgment, and so on and so fort.

24

In 1976, the district court entered an order that

25the original union had become defunct.

That was Local 550

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the Transport Workers Union, AF of L-CIO.

The Court,

2 however, allowed without prejudice the new union, Local 551,
3 to intervene.

That order was entered in April of 1976, and

4a few days later Local 551 intervened, and so, again, from
51976 on, the union was participating in the litigation.
6

In April of 1977, this union came into being.

7They did not, however, file to intervene into this case.
8 And they did not come into the case until July of 1979,
9before the settlement agreement was approved by the district
lOcourt.

One might speculate about why during an eleven-year

11 history of this case there were two years when this union
12was in existence when a union was not a party to the
13 litigation.

But there is no need to speculate, because the

l4union explained why it stayed out of the case to the
I5district judge, and we think that explanation contradicts a
16good many of the things not only that Mr. Jolley has just
I7said to this Court, but also that the union has said in its
I8reply brief.
19

There is a document entitled Supplemental

20 Suggestions of Intervenor IFFA in Support of Motion to
21 Intervene, and I have lodged copies of this document with
22the Clerk of the Court, and they are available, and I would
23like to just read to the Court what the union told the
24district court.
25

"In this case" — and this was filed in July of

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 '79 — "In this case the union certainly had no reason to
2intervene prior to this time.

The union was not in

3existence for the first seven years of this litigation.
4Shortly after the union came into existence, counsel for the
5union spoke with counsel for the defendant regarding this
61itigation, and it was mutually agreed that no purpose would
7be served by the union intervening at that time, but that
8 intervention by the union might be appropriate if and when
9the case ever reached the remedy stage."
10

So, the union came into this case purposely only

11 at the time of the remedy, and the union's intervention
12petition was aimed at two arguments.

One, that the district

l3court should not exercise jurisdiction because the court of
14appeals had ruled otherwise, and Number Two, that the
15seniority award would have an adverse impact, an unusual
16adverse impact.
17

Mr. Jolley in his argument throughout the brief

18has referred to the settlement agreement depriving his
19clients of their rights.
20do that.

The settlement agreement did not

There was a separate seniority award entered by

21 the district judge, not simply after the union made
22objections, but after a three-month hearing on the matter in
23which depositions were taken, exhibits were introduced,
24cross examination was engaged in, and arguments were made.

25

After that litigation was over, with TWA standing

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Iaside, is the point at which the seniority award was made by
2 the district court, pursuant to Section 706 (g) of the Act,
3 which provides that if a violation is found the district
4court has jurisdiction to enter a remedy.

Mr. Jolley said

5 there was no finding of violation with respect to Subclass
6 B.

7

To borrow from the Solicitor General's brief, I

8think that argument is syntactically complex.

What he means

9 by that is not that the district court never found that
10 Subclass B people were not victims of a Title 7 violation,
11 because the district court did so find.

He cannot mean that

12 the district court found no jurisdiction.
13court did so find.

The district

What he means is that because the court

14 of appeals reversed the district court, therefore we can
15ignore the fact that there was a violation found, and to
16make it plain, ani now I would like to address the
17 jurisdictional argument, but in doing so, I want to -18

QUESTION;

Mr. Randolph, ordinarily when the court

19 of appeals reverses the district court, the district court's
20findings are overturned, are they not?
21

MR. RANDOLPH;

That's right.

But in this case,

22the case reached the court of appeals on a Section 1292(b)
23appeal, an interlocutory appeal.
24entered.

No final judgment had been

There was no stay of the district court's

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 there was a stay of the mandate of the court of appeals
2juigment.

So when the district court had the case before it

3 in 1979, while petitions were pending here, the case was the
4same as if the court of appeals had not ruled, and we made
5 the point in our brief that what petitioners are really
6arguing is that the district judge should have been
7persuaded by the court of appeals’ opinion.
8

A mandate compells compliance.

It does not

9compell agreement, and the court of appeals mandate had been
lOstayed.

The district court -- if the district court was not

11 persuaded by it, and the district court was not, the

QUESTIONS

Well, you wouldn’t go so far as to say

2lthat if the district court dismisses the complaint, the
22court of appeals orders it reinstated, that the district
23court may simply refuse to continue litigation on that
24complaint because the mandate has been stayed of the court
25of appeals,

would you?

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. RANDOLPH;

If the district court has dismissed

2 the complaint, and the court of appeals has reversed, and no
3mandate has come down yet, I think the district court is not
4-- can be guided by the opinion, but is not bound to
5reinstate the complaint until the mandate issues.
6

The question that I am about to address is, we

7 think, the heart of the union’s argument in this case,
8is jurisdictional.

which

Although the union talks about lack of

9violation, they mean jurisdiction.

Although they talk about

lOlack of jurisdiction, what they really mean is whether the
11 court of appeals was correct, and I would like to quote Mr.
l2Jolley’s statement to the court of appeals — or to the
13 district court.

It is not in the appendix.

14 Volume 2 , Page 19.

It should be at

It is the sentence that begins after the

15 sentence ending at the top .
16

He said.

"If it" — the Supreme C ourt -- "does

I7grant cert and reverses the Seventh Circuit, as we are going
18to ask you to do, then I think our position is basically,”
I9and this is the union's position, "to be heard on the basis
20of seniority alone, and to try to show the Court there would
21 be a serious adverse impact which would be within the
22Court's discretion."
23

Now, the Court, of course, has granted

24certiorari.

The question about whether the particular

25remedy in this case is appropriate is not an issue in the

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

lease, because the Court denied certiorari with respect to
2the union's last question presented in its petition which
3dealt with that, and the question that remains, we submit,
4is the question that we have addressed in our brief and that
5 the Solicitor General has addressed in its brief with
6respect to jurisdiction, and that question arises because,
7as Mr. Jolley correctly states, with respect to some, and
8what the percentage is, I believe, is probably about 90
9percent of the plaintiffs in this case, their complaint was
lOnot filed within -- their charge with the EEOC was not filed
11 within 90 days of the time that they were terminated for
l2becoming mothers.
13

The complaint in this case was filed, as I said,

I4by the union, and after the union filed the complaint, TWA
I5answered.
16Page 8A.

The answer is contained in the joint appendix, at
TWA's answer admitted jurisdiction, raised two

17affirmative defenses, neither of which were statute of

l8limitations.

Two years later, and this is contained in the

igjoint appendix at Page 54A, the district court entered an
20order at TWA’s behest.

21

That order, which is contained in the appendix on

2254A, found that the court had jurisdiction over all members
23of the plaintiff class.

That order was pursuant to a

24settlement that TWA had worked out with the prior union,
25Which was ultimately set aside, as I mentioned before.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The case wound its way on, and four years after

2the filing of the complaint, TWA made a motion to amend
3their answer.

They claim now that the plaintiff's complaint

4can be defended on the basis that there was -- that they
5failed to comply with the "statute of limitations".

The

6district court granted TWA leave to amend, but cautioned
7 that TWA was going to be required to show that its delay and
8failure to raise this defense for four years was excusable,
9 and that the plaintiff suffered no prejudice as a result of
10 that.
11

Five years after the lawsuit began, TWA appeared

I2in district court in 1975, and for the first time in this
13case raised the question whether this was jurisdictional.
l4Former Section 706(d).

TWA argued that the failure to

15comply with the charge filing provisions of Title 7 was a
16jurisdictional defect, and since it is jurisdictional, TWA
I7wanted to take advantage of the ancient maxim that any party
I8at any time in the litigation can raise a jurisdictional
l9problem.

The district court asked how in the world a motion

20like this can be filed five years after the lawsuit began,
21 but I guess I have no choice, because you are raising a
22 jurisdictional question.
23

It was at that point that the district court

24rejected TWA's argument about jurisdiction, found a

25continuing violation, entered summary judgment for Subclass

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Those two findings, summary judgment and continuing

2violation, were the subject of 1292(b) interlocutory appeals
3to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals ruled in
41978 that in fact the time limits were jurisdictional, and
5we petitioned for certiorari, and the court has granted our
6 petition.

QUESTIONS

Did the district court ever find there

8had been a waiver?
9
10

HR. RANDOLPH;
QUESTIONS

The district court --

And assuming it was not jurisdictional,

11 they hadn't complied with the time limit.

Did the district

12court ever rule on that, or did the court of appeals just
I3say it is doubtful if there was a waiver?
14

MR. RANDOLPHS

I don't believe the court of

15appeals said it was doubtful that it was a waiver.

I think

16the —
17

QUESTION;

Well, I thought I understood your

18colleague to say that.
19

MR. RANDOLPH;

Yes.

I don't believe that is

20accurate, Justice White.

21

QUESTION;

Did the district court make any finding

22that the settlement agreement itself constituted a waiver?
23That the time deficiencies were not jurisdictional, but
24inerely statute of limitations?

25

MR. RANDOLPH;

No, because the district court did

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 not have to so find.

Once having found a continuing

2violation, Justice Brennan, there was no need to consider
3 whether there was a waiver of the statute of limitations, so
4there was no finding in that respect.

The district

5court's —
6

QUESTION;

Did you make any argument that if this

7 is statute of limitations, that the settlement did
8constitute a waiver?
9

MR. RANDOLPH:

We think that that is the only

10thing that TWA in fact waived in this case, is their right
11 to further litigate the question whether they waived the
12statute of limitations.

That is what they gave up through

I3the settlement, from our point of view.
14

QUESTION;

Do I understand the adversary

l5petitioner who just argued to take the position that even if
I6this was a statute of limitations and not jurisdictional,
17 that nevertheless the settlement is invalid?
18

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, they say -- for the first

I9time, I think, in this litigation, the union has said that
20we should be allowed to raise the statute of limitations
21 defense, even if TWA has waived it, and our answer to that
22is, Number One, their petition for intervention under Rule
2324(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is supposed to
24state all of their claims or their defenses, and if the
25Court reviews that -- it is in the appendix -- you will find

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 no statute of limitations
2

QUESTION*

Do you understand that in saying that

3 the settlement is invalid, they are really arguing that it
4is only because it is time barred.

Is that it?

Even if it

5is statute of limitations and not jurisdictional?
6

MR. RANDOLPH*

Well, I think, that their claim is

7entirely jurisdictional. Justice Brennan.

They cannot say

8 that there was no violation, no finding of violation, unless
9they make a jurisdictional argument.

The Court has said on

10a number of occasions that the failure to comply with the
11 statute of limitations doesn't extinguish the claim.

They

I2are saying that failure to comply with a jurisdictional
13defect does extinguish the claim.

It is the only way they

I4can make that argument.
15

QUESTION*

You still have to argue the

16 jurisdictional —
17

MR. RANDOLPH*

Yes.

I have a few minutes left.

I8think we are in good company in making this argument.

I

The

19EE0C and the United States have filed an amicus brief that
20basically support or we support their construction, one way
21 or the other.

Twenty-five judges of the Fifth Circuit in a

22case we relied upon — it is an opinion by Judge Anderson
23and I commend it to the Court — in Coke joined in holding
24that this particular provision, the 90-day charge, was not
25jurisdictional.

I guess we can call -- take credit also for

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the Eleventh Circuit now, because that was rendered before
2 those two circuits split, and every judge sitting in those
3 circuits has agreed.
4

In fact, every circuit -- our review and the

5Solicitor General's review indicates that every circuit
6court that has considered this question agrees that the
79-day charge filing provision with the EEOC is not
8 jurisdictional except the Seventh, and this is the only case
9 representing a position of a court of appeals now that takes
10that position.
11

We argue on the basis of statutory interpretation.

l2This is in essence a question of what Congress intended.
13 And folllowing the usual course, one looks first at what the
14 statute says.

The section dealing with jurisdiction of the

I5federal courts simply says, each U. S. district court shall
16have jurisdictions of actions brought under this
17 subchapter.
18section 706.

There is no qualification in that section, the
There are no conditions.

There is no

19cross-reference to any other provision.
20

The charge filing provision that is at issue here

21 deals with the time for filing a charge with the EEOC, not
22the time for filing a charge with the court.

It is a

23separate provision.

24

One thing that is clear, and the Court's prior

25opinions have so said -- Franks has been mentioned,

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Albermarle Paper Company versus Moody, and a number of other
2cases -- that the remedial provisions of Title 7 were
3modeled after the National Labor Relations Act, and the
4 close provision in the National Labor Relations Act,
5former Section 706(d) of Title 7, that we are dealing with
6now, has language similar to what we are talking about
7here.

It provides that complaints have to be filed within

8six months with the NLRB, and the courts have uniformly,
9without exception, construed that provision to be an
lOordinary statute of limitations, subject to equitable
11 modification.
12

There are statements of Members of Congress on the

13floor in 1964 to the effect that what they were designing by
I4this provision is a period of limitations.
15

QUESTION*

I thought the statute of limitations

16governed actions at law, and that equitable modification
17would deal with the latches.
18

MR. RANDOLPH*

Well, this is a — this, I think --

19this suit is analogous to a suit under the National Labor
20Relations Act for a make whole remedy, and I think Congress
21 so considered that as the proper analogy. Justice Rehnquist,
22and whether it should be called a statute of limitations or
23some other term subject to equitable modification I don't
24think is the significant point.

I would point out, however,

25that the committee reports, when this section was amended in

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 1972, and extended to 180 days, in fact called it a statute
2 of limitations.
3

QUESTION:

Which is the term you ordinarily use

4for an action at law.
5

MR. RANDOLPH:

I suppose.

But I notice that TWA

6has taken us to task because they said that the NLRA is not
7a good analogy.

Our only point here is, we are dealing with

8a question of statutory interpretation, and the important
9thing is what Congress's analogy was, and if you look at
lOPage 27 of our brief, you will see that, for example, the
11 House -- the minority view of the House Labor Committee
I2called the filing period a statute of limitations, and said
I3it was identical to the statute of limitations under the
14National Labor Relations Act, and the Senate Labor Committee
iSsection by section analysis basically said the same thing.
16

The opinions of this Court, we think -~

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. RANDOLPH:

19

QUESTION;

May I ask, Mr. Randolph -Yes.

-- are you getting any comfort out of

20the 180-day limitation and the Age Discrimination Act?
21

MR. RANDOLPH;

Yes.

That was amended in 1978.

22The Court in Coke mentioned that.

There was a case in this

23Court, I believe, called Dart, where the Court evenly split,
24and whether it was over that issue I don't know, but that

25 A ct is modeled after Title 7, and in Coke, the court of

3provision to be construed as a jurisdictional matter, but
4rather as a statute of limitations.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE A. CARTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CARTON;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

22Court, just two matters that I wanted to dispose of on this
23question of jurisdiction.

One was Mr. Rehnquist's point,

24and I just wanted to read from our brief, ’’The NLRA does not
25contain any preliminary requirements like the state and EEOC

proceedings, without which Title 7 could not have been

2 enacted."

3

Secondly, as far as the 1972 amendment, the 1972

4 amendments which brought in the 180 days were applicable
5 only to charges pending with the commission on the date of
6 enactment, and all charges filed thereafter.

7

The two previous speakers really have not touched

8 upon the matter that is most important as far as TWA is

9 concerned.

TWA is interested in the settlement that will

10

end this litigation.

11

dispute between reinstated employees and current employees.

12

TWA --

13

It is not involved in the seniority

QUESTION*

You can't avoid being involved in it,

14 can you?
15

MR. CARTON*

I am not sure, Justice White.

I feel

16 that the settlement agreement can be approved -17

QUESTION*

I know, but what if -- if we say the

18 district court didn't have jurisdiction to approve the
19 settlement with respect to 90 percent of the class, you
20 can't avoid

being affected.

21

MR. CARTON*

22

QUESTION*

23

MR. CARTON*

That is right.
That is all I meant.
That is right.

TWA stopped the

24 practice two months after the complaint was filed.

One year

25 later, it entered into a settlement agreement under Rule

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

123(e).

ft similar settlement was entered into with American

2 Airlines and the union, and both of these settlements were
3turned down by the court of appeals, primarily on the issue
4 of the failure to grant retroactive seniority.
5

So, then we go back to the district court, and we

6have two years of discovery, and the district court, as has
7been discussed, hands down a judgment that there has been a
8violation of the ftct, and so first American Airlines, we
9have a settlement agreement negotiated.

The settlement

lOagreement is approved by the court of appeals, certiorari is
11 denied by this Court.
12

So, TWA is beginning to feel that we are getting

13somewhere.

So, we go ahead and negotiate basically the same

14agreement as the American agreement two years later.

The

l5union intervenes, just the way they did in the American
16case.

We have the hearings before the district court.

This

I7time we want to be even more careful, so we don't just have
l8one order involving both seniority and the settlement
I9agreement, we have two orders, a settlement agreement order
20and a second order in which the court grants retroactive
21 seniority as he was authorized to do under the settlement
22 agreement.
23

And as you all know, the matter goes on, and is

24approved by the court of appeals, and we feel we are home
25free.

1 anything, and our feeling is that there has been a violation
2 of the requirements of Title 7, whether you label those
3 requirements as statute of limitations or as jurisdictional
4 prerequisites or even subject matter jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

But as to the effectiveness of the

6settlement agreement, it does make a difference, doesn’t it,
7 whether this is merely time -- these are merely time barred
8claims or whether they are jurisdictionally barred.

MR. CARTON*

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CARTON*

That’s correct.
Doesn't it make a difference?
But as far as the -- as far as the

12settlement is concerned, our feeling is that there is -13there is some advantage to the condition precedent idea
I4which we have suggested, which was, incidentally, the term
15used in the Coke case.

We feel that if there was a

16violation on the part of all of these 92 percent by not
17filing their charges, that these people are in a situation
18where the settlement is fair as far as they are concerned.
19

We also feel, getting back to this jurisdiction

20question, that there was not a final order on the part of
21 the courts with respect to jurisdiction back in -22

QUESTION*

I guess what I am really trying to get

23at, Mr. Carton, do you want us to hold that the failure to
24file within the 180 days was a jurisdictional defect?
25that your position?

You want the settlement to stand.

Either way, whether you hold it

6jurisdictional or not, you think the district court was

MR. CARTON:

QUESTION;

That is right, Justice White.
No matter what you say about

10 jurisdiction.
11

MR. CARTON:

That is exactly the way we feel, and

I2we feel that -13

QUESTION:

You don't think your chances are better

14of having the settlement stand if our holding is that it is
15merely a statute of limitations rather than a jurisdictiona1
16def ect?
17

MR. CARTON:

Our feeling doesn't really, I think,

I8matter.
19

QUESTION:

20position in

You are just embarrassed by your prior

the court of appeals in that respect.

21

(General laughter.)

22

MR. CARTON:

We have tried all along to do what is

23best for TWA.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CARTON:

Yes, right.
But the point still is that we made

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this settlement because we didn't know what was going to
2happen at a proceeding such as we are having now, and we
3felt — we felt that we should go ahead and make the
4 settlement.

We were not very much concerned about the

5powers of the district court, because we felt that, as I
6said before, the case was not final, and so here we are.
7 Now, I would like, if I could, to get into one area which we
8think is very important to our case, and that is the
9question of the power of the district court.
10

The district court is in a situation here, we

11 think, where it can under the ancient rules of equity come
l2down and handle this retroactive seniority issue.
13handle it under 706(g).

It can

It can handle it under its broad

14powers of equity.
15

I noticed a case that I am sure that you are

16familiar with, the Swann case on busing, where they had a
17quotation, "The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the
18power of the chancellor to do equity and to mold each decree
19to the necessities of the particular case.

Flexibility

20rather than rigidity has distinguished it.

The qualities of

21 mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for
22nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public
23interest and private needs as well as between competing
24private claims."

25

QUESTION:

Hr. Carton, is it possible to state in

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

lone or two sentences what is being disputed and by whom in
2this case?
3

MR. CARTON:

I think that the question of the

4settlement agreement. Justice Rehnquist, and the seniority
5order have been confused.

I think that the relationship --

6they are intermingled, and I don't think they should be.

I

7think there are two separate orders, and what I am trying to
8say by quoting regarding the powers of a court of equity is
9that a court of equity in a situation like this has the
lOpower to come in here and finalize in a comprehensive way
11 all of these complications that have grown up over eleven
12years of litigation so that these women can go back to work.
13

QUESTION;

14

MR. CARTON :

15

QUESTION;

l6ourselves?

Mr. Carton, do you want us to do that?
Yes, sir.
What did we do to bring that on

You want us to take this whole eleven years of

l7litigation and work out a plan.
18

MR. CARTON:

No, we have a plan for you.

QUESTION;

QUESTION;

Oh, that isdifferent.

QUESTION;

Well, certainly courts of equity are

Well, I hope this case doesn't turn

3eleven years.

It has only gone on for

But the idea that we still have is that the

4 court is now in a position here to, by approving the
5settlement agreement, this will then, under the Court's
6usual practice, make moot the other two cases, and that is
7the end of it.
8

And that is what we would like.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Do you have anything

9further, Mr. Jolley?
10

MR. JOLLEY*

Very briefly.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. JOLLEY, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 80-951 - REBUTTAL

15

MR. JOLLEY*

Thank you, sir.

16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

l7four points remain to be countered.

Plaintiffs particularly

isargue thatt there has been a finding of a violation on the
igbasis of the district court's summary judgment order in
201976.

The first thing I want to point out is that the

21 district court order approving the settlement agreement, the
22district court order granting the seniority, and

the Seventh

23Circuit opinion affirming that exercise by the district
24court did not in any way refer to the finding of a violation
25on the part of TWA or the commission of an unlawful

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employment practice by TWA as a basis for approving what TWA
2and the plaintiffs did.

It was based instead entirely on

3and laced throughout referenced to the settlement agreement
4between TWA and the plaintiffs, and the policy encouraging
5 voluntary settlements even in the lack of jurisdiction.
6

Secondly, the plaintiff maintains that there

7really was a violation found as to Subclass B because the
8act -- because the practice by TWA was found to be
9discriminatory.
10so

That is not so, and moreover it cannot be

by virtue of this Court's decision in Evans, where you

11 very clearly held that the timely filing of a charge is a
I2part of the violation, and that a discriminatory act not
13made the basis of a timely charge must be treated as lawful.
)

14

In that case, the no marriage rule of the airline

15was unlawful, but it had to be treated as lawful because it
16was not subjected to a timely filing of a charge.
17

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

MR. JOLLEY*

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Your time is up, Mr. Jolley.

Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you, gentlemen.

The

20case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 11*06 o'clock a.m., the case in the

22above-entitled matter was submitted.)
