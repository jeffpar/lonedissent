ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. CHAFFIN, ESQ.,
OS BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHAFFIN;

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it please the Court;

10

This is'a case involving the interpretation of

11

a very old seaman's wage statute, a statute that had its

12

origin first in 1790 and later came to be known as what

13

is known now as the double wage penalty statute, which

14

took its present form approximately in 1872.

15

That statute provides in essence. Your Honors,

16

that if a seaman on a foreign voyage, such as the

17

Petitioner was found to be by the trial court in this

18

case, is not timely and properly paid his earned wages,

19

those wages which' are rightfully and uncontestedly due

20

to him, one-third of those wages on the date of his

21

discharge and the remainder within four days thereafter,

22

that every master or owner who irefuses or neglects to

23

make payment without sufficient cause in the manner

24

provided by the statute shall pay to the seaman a sum

25

equal to two days pay for each and every day during

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1
2

which such delay shall continue.
Your Honors, that is the heart of the case

3

here today.

4

found uncontestedly that the seaman, the Petitioner, had

5

been denial by the Respondent his wages, that he had

6

made timely demand for his wages, and that even though

7

demand had been timely made and with diligence he had

8

pursued his demand, that the Respondent failed in an

9

unreasonable manner, acted recaleitrantly, callously,

In this particular case the trial court

10

willfully and wantonly and failed to pay the Petitioner

11

his wages called for by the statute, Your Honor.

12

QUESTIONS

I got lost a little bit in the

3

arithmetic here, counsel.

4

what were the actual dollars he lost for the actual

5

days, apart from all te penalty provisions?

6

MR. CHAFFINs

What was the — in dollars,

Your Honor, if I may regress to

7

the facts just a little bit, the Petitioner was actually

8

due on his discharge $412.50, the amount of money which

9

had been withheld1 from his pay check and was to be paid

20
21

to him when he was discharged.
The actual facts are. Your Honor, that the

22

Petitioner was at work as a seaman on board the

23

Respondent's vessel, which was the Lay Barge 27.

24

received injuries which were due solely to an

25

unseaworthy condition of that vessel.

He

He had to leave

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the vessel to have minor surgery and to recuperate from

2

his injuries.

3

He left the vessel, Your Honor, on April the

4

1st of 1975.

5

from his paycheck $412.50 that was to be paid to him on

6

the date of his discharge.

7

Your Honor, and when he was discharged in the port of

8

Rotterdam the trial court found that the Respondent

9

acted unreasonably, callously, willfully and wantonly in

10
11

At that time the Respondent had withheld

He was not paid that money,

disregard of his rights to receive those wages.
Subsequently, the Petitioner attempted with

12

due diligence, as the trial court found, to collect

13

those wages, but was denied the wages. Your Honor.

14

Now, the real thrust of this case, Your Honor,

15

is not the validity nor the applicability of this

16

statute, but the size of the penalty which the statute

17

carries with it.

18

sentence in the statute which I believe is the heart of

19

the case, it reads, Your Honors:

20

If I may read to the Court the one

"Every master or owner who refuses or neglects

21

to make payment in the manner herein before mentioned

22

without sufficient cause shall :pay to the seaman a sum

23

equal to two days pay for each and every day during

24

which payment is delayed beyond the respective period,

25

which sum shall be recoverable as wages."

QUESTION;

Hr. Chaffin, I gather he got a

judgment of 523,570.

3

MS. CHAFFIN;

4

QUESTION:

5

And of that, only £6,881.60 is

penalty wages?

6

MR. CHAFFIN;

7

QUESTION;

8

He did, Your Honor.

That is true, Your Honor.

And is that the only item in issue

before us?

9

ME. CHAFFIN:

That is, Your Honor.

He was

10

awarded damages for injuries and for maintenance and

11

cure.

12

QUESTION;

Maintenance and cure, prejudgment

13

interest, attorneys fees and recovery for pain and

14

suffering.

15

ME. CHAFFIN;

16

QUESTION;

17

That is correct. Your Honor.

But isn *t the $5,000 recovery for

pain and suffering and penalty wages?

18

MR. CHAFFIN;

No, sir. Your Honor.

The

19

Respondent in thi's case has satisfied the judgment in

20

full —

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. CHAFFIN;

23

Except for the 68 -He has .paid the $6800 also. Your

Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CHAFFIN;

Oh.
The issue before this Court,

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Your Honor, is whether or not the trial court could

2

exercise its equitable discretion to shorten the running

3

of the penalty or to reduce the penalty to an amount

4

which is below that called for by the plain ana clear

5

language of the statute.

6

QUESTION;

I know.

But what I’m trying to get

7

at is, the only item we have is the penalty wages of

8

$6881?

9
10

HE. CHAFFIN*

That is the sole issue before

this Court.

11

QUESTION;

Right.

And you suggest that

12

there's an argument that it ought to be less.

13

less?

14

HR. CHAFFIN;

15

QUESTION;

16

HR. CHAFFIN;

17

the Court should be —
QUESTION;

How much

No, Your Honor.

None?
I suggest that the position of

No, no.

Does your adversary say it

ought to be less ’than £6831, nothing?
HR. CHAFFIN:

20

Your Honor, he does not contest

21

the $6880.

That has been paid in satisfaction of

22

judgment.

The adversary, the Respondent here, my

23

adversary, takes the position that the judgment of the

24

trial court was correct.

QUESTION;

The $23,000 —

QUESTION:

You say it should be more, is that

Yes, sir.

it?

5

MR. CHAFFIN:

6

QUESTION:

7

NR. CHAFFIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

What's the figure you suggest?
Your Honor, the figure that I

8

suggest will come to something around $300,000 when you

9

apply the statute exactly as written.
QUESTION:

10

the statute —

Nr. Chaffin, under your theory

11

would it continue to run until this very day because it

12

isn't paid?

What about during the course of appeal?

NR. CHAFFIN:

13

No, Your Honor.

That question

14

was answered by this Court in the case of Pacific Mail

15

against Schmidt in 1916, written by Justice Holmes, Your

16

Honor.

17

The Court there held —
QUESTION:

Do you interpret that holding as

18

saying that the Court has discretion, then, not to give

19

it during the appellate period?;

20

interpretation?

21

MR. CHAFFIN:

Is that your

The direct holding was that the

22

penalty would not run during what was there a good faith

23

appeal, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

I do not know whether —
Was that on the theory that the

Court had discretion?

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. CHAFFIN;

The theory is not announced

2

there or not stated to be discretion there, Your Honor.

3

It's simply stated that -- the Court simply stated, I

4

believe, that it was not the intent of Congress there

5

that that penalty should continue to accrue then.

6

QUESTION;

But the literal language would not

7

appear to admit for that distinction either.

8

wondering whether the Court may have discretion that

9

goes back further.

10

MR. CHAFFIN;

So I'm

Well, Your Honor, in the Pacific

11

Mail case the trial court entered a judgment that

12

inflicted the penalty up through the date of the decree

13

of the trial court.

14

that decree reviewed.

15

to add to the penalty during the appellate procedure,

16

and the Supreme Court's action, Your Honor, was simply

17

to delete what the Court of Appeals had added, but not

18

to review the judgment of the trial court where they had

19

exercised the penalty for the entire period up until the

20

date of the '"istrict court's decree.

21

22

QUESTION;

And the appellant sought to have
The Court of Appeals then acted

QUESTION;

Hr. Chaffin, I suppose it's totally

2

irrelevant, but I take it he has long since recovered

from his discomfiture?

He made an uneventful recovery.

its findings of fact and it's uncontested.

I

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

think the statute reads "without sufficient cause" and I

would not think that if they had made a simple clerical

there's no explanation.

They just said --

What if they said, we'll pay

I guess literally the statute applies.
MR. CHAFFIN!

I wouldn’t think it literally

8

would — it perhaps might apply literally, Your Honor.

9

But the Court, this very Court, has interpreted the

10

"without sufficient cause" provision of the statute to

11

mean that it must be a callous, recalcitrant,

12

unreasonable withholding.

13
14

QUESTION;

Did you have to pay -- did your

client have to pay his own way home?

15

MR. CHAFFIN;

16

QUESTION;

He did, Your Honor.

That callous and recalcitrant goes

17

to the employer's state of mind, not to the amount

withheld, doesn't it?

19

White's example that they had said, we'll pay you $400

If I might point out to the

HR. CHAFFIN:

It is my understanding of the

Before or after suit, Your

Hr. Chaffin, I think you told me

12

earlier that without the help of counsel initially the

13

Petitioner made demands upon the employer.

14

HR. CHAFFIN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Ha did, Your Honor.

How frequently were those demands

made?
HR. CHAFFIN:

Well, Your Honor, the evidence

18

introduced at the trial court was that he made the

19

demand when he le'ft their employ, and there were

20

records, telephone records, that he had telephoned his

21

employer on several occasions previous to that --

22

subsequent to that.

23

asking for his wages, Your Honor.

24
25

QUESTION:

In addition, he wrote them a letter

And on each instance what he was

asking for was the $412?

I beg your pardon. Your Honor.

My question is, if they wanted to

where could they have paid it before suit was filed?

MR. CHAFFIN;

18

MR. CHAFFIN;

Oh, I see.

I see.

The statute provides, Your

19

Honor, that it is‘ a sum recoverable as wages, not that

20

it is his wages that he is recovering. Your Honor.

21

penalty paction is not a wage itself; it is a sum

22

recoverable as wages, a sum equal to two days pay.

23

it is not to be considered as wages, Your Honor.

A portion of the Respondent's, and I think the

that in the Respondent's opinion this is to be

It isn't just twice what they've withheld?

which the withholding continues.

11

there is a distinction there.

QUESTION;

they have withheld?

14

It is not two days

It is a sum equal to that.

And

But it is not a sum equal to what

It is not, Your Honor.

that they have withheld bears no relationship to the

Do our cases touch on whether or

not the employer has any equitable defenses?
HR. CHAFFIN;

Your Honor, there is a case out

13

of this Court called HcCrea against the United States.

14

That case is once' again by Justice Stone, in 1934.

15

that particular case, Your Honor, the Petitioner, who

16

was a seaman, urged on the Court that his wages had been

17

withheld from him without sufficient cause.

18

In

The trial court found that they had not been

19

withheld, but tha't the seaman had not presented himself

20

to receive his wages.

21

took the position that the failure to pay without

22

sufficient cause activated the .penalty even after the

23

period of time at which they are originally due to him.

24
25

However, after that the seaman

Hr. Justice Stone in that case. Your Honor,
said that you do not consider events which happen beyond

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the time period set forth in the statute, that the

2

statute provides a reasonable and a definite manner in

3

which the seaman can recover the penalty.

4

Now, Your Honor, I believe that that is a

5

perfect analogy to this case, because what the

6

Respondent is attempting to do here truly. Your Honor,

7

is to draw into issue facts that occurred after the

8

statute had been triggered.

9

QUESTION;

Yes, but they did in the Pacific

11

judgment had been entered and there was reasonable cause

12

to appeal it.

action had merged into the judgment, which is the common

3

and ordinary rule --

QUESTION:

6

to apply to a later period of time.

They read the word "sufficient cause”

ME. CHAFFIN:

That's right. Your Honor, that’s

correct.

9

QUESTION:

What if an employer, upon receiving

10

the demand, simply said, you're wrong, you have not any

11

wages coming, and then there was a dispute.

12

it turn on what the court would ultimately find cn

13

whether at first there was a bona fide dispute, and

14

second, whether their conduct was, using these strong

15

terms that have been mentioned --

16

MR. CHAFFIN:

Then would

Whether, if the employer owed

17

the wages, Your Honor, the dispute would turn — or the

18

applicability of the statute would turn on whether or

19

not the withholdi'ng was without- sufficient cause.

20

if the employer wants to take that risk they may do so,

21

Your Honor.

Now,

The more reasonable approach is to tender the

22

wages, to pay constructively the seaman's wages into the

24

registry of the court, and then proceed from that point

I1R. CHAFFIN;

Tha t' s , right , Your Honor.

I

23

point out to the Court, Your Honors, that this statute

had its origin in 1790, but in

originally read that the penalty would be a sum not

1872 the statute

1

greater than two lays pay for a time period not

2

exceeding ten days.

3

That provision was consciously deleted from the statute

4

in 1898 by the Congress, Your Honors, at which time the

5

penalty was changed to read one day’s pay for each and

6

every day during which the penalty continued.

7

It gave the judiciary discretion.

So the legislative history of the statute,

8

Your Honor, even though it be skimpy, I would say to the

9

Court is contained actually in the evolution of the

10

statute itself in that the statute originally contained

11

a provision that allowed the trial court discretion.

12

That provision was removed by the Congress, Your Honor.

13

It was a provision that was removed after the bill had

14

been passed by the Fifty-Fourth Congress in

15

went to the Senate in 1898.

So the shipping industry as well as the seamen

challenged, which it is not here. Your Honor, and the

MR. GOLLER;

Mr. Justice White, the reason

that the demand — the money was not paid, if the demand

14

QUESTION;

How do you read discretion into the

language of the statute?

15

MR. GOLLER;

I think you really have to look

16

at the history of the statute itself and to realize and

17

consider the role of the admiralty courts.

18

admiralty courts have been accepte as the protectors of

19

seamen's rights f,rom the time this statute was enacted

20

originally in 1790.

21

of the statute, because the statute itself provides that

22

the master must respond in admiralty.

And that’s shown by a clear reading

Congress as early as 1790 was aware and knew

that this statute would be construed in an admiralty

court.

QUESTION:

Are you saying just because it’s an

admiralty court we have to read in discretion?

4

MR. GOLLER:

I say, yes, Your Honor, because

5

it is an admiralty court and because the admiralty

6

courts have traditionally been the protectors of the

7

seamen’s rights, I say that Congress enacted this

8

statement with that knowledge beforehand, with the

9

understanding that the admiralty courts would protect

10

the rights of these seamen.

12

QUESTIONi

It certainly is strange, after the

13

lawsuit was started — at least that somebody in the

14

15

MR. G0LLER:

They did, Your Honor.

And that

16

is of course the reason that the Respondent paid off the

17

judgment in September 1980.

18

September 17th,

19

The judgment was paid

1980.

But we <think that the heart of this case is

20

the fact that the statute itself is a remedial statute.

21

It's not a penalty statute.

22

The statute provides that these sums shall be

23

recoverable as wages, not as penalties.

24
25

It's not penal in nature.

And if we turn to this Court’s holding in
Pacific Mail against Schmidt, we say that that case is

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

direct authority for the proposition that the court has

2

discretion for setting the time of the penalty.

3

case a seaman who returned from a foreign voyage was

4

paid his wages through a date, September 23, 1913.

5

stayed on the vessel for seven or eight days later and

6

then was discharged when they found some silverware

7

missing and accused him of

8

the value of the silverware against the wages due him

9

for those eight days.

taking it.

In that

Ke

So they offset

10

And the trial judge found that the offset was

11

unlawful, was without sufficient cause, and invoked the

12

penalty up until the date of trial, which was a date

13

like November, 45 days or so.

14

extended that penalty through the date of the appeal.

15

When it got to the Supreme Court, the Court

The Court of Appeals

16

held that there was sufficient cause for taking the

17

appeal and therefore period of the penalty would be --

18

would stop as of the date of the district court’s

19

decree.

20

the wages were withheld without sufficient cause, then

21

it seems to me that no court after that can come along

22

and say that the penalty will run for 30 days or 60 days

23

or 90 days and then the penalties shall stop, because if

24

you read the statute literally the penalty is payable,

25

if it is a penalty, is payable for each and every day

Now, logically, once there is a finding that

that payment is withheld.
So literally it’s payable until paid, which in
our case frankly would be September 17, 1980.
QUESTION:

What about your opponent's argument

5

that the claim merges in the judgment and once you have

6

a judgment the rules governing payment of judgments

7

would govern, rather than the statute?

9

MR. GOLLERi
in Pacific Mail.

That is not what this Court held

What this Court did hold in Pacific

10

Mail was that there was sufficient cause for the

11

shipowner taking the appeal from the district court's

12

judgment, and that's all that it held.

13
14
15

We do not think that there is a merger under
the circumstances, if you read the statute literally.

MB. G3LLER:

QUESTION.*

13

MR. GOLLEE:

We are not.
Or the $412 of wages?
We are not.

So far as we know,

14

that $412.50 was not in fact paid, and the trial judge

15

found that it was not paid.

16

The only thing that we are saying is that the

17

trial judge was correct in exercising his discretion to

18

limit the period of the penalty and that he has that

19

discretion, and that is vested in the admiralty courts.

Mr. Goller, I gather your whole

case turns on our accepting your submission that because

it's in admiralty the statute necessarily, in its

application in admiralty, is conditioned on an equitable

19

discretion in thei trial judge to do what he thinks is

20

the just thing to do in terms of fixing a penalty

21

period?

22

MR. GOLLER:

I feel that's a fair summation of

23

our position, based upon the decisions of the First,

24

Second, Fourth and Fifth Circuits.

25

case to the contrary really is the Swain case of the

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Third Circuit and that the Swaine Court simply

2

misinterpreted this Court's holding in the Pacific Wail

3

versus Schmidt case, because in that case that's exactly

4

what this Court did.

5

After the penalty had been invoked, had been

6

triggered and had run for some period of time, as I

7

recall around 45 to 60 days -- in any event, from

8

September 13th to about November the 11th -- then this

9

Court held that the penalty should cease at that time.

10

So if we read the-statute literally this Court would not

11

be empowered to make that holding.

12

Now, it did it, the Court did this, by saying

13

that there was sufficient cause for the appeal.

14

we accept Petitioner's argument and literally,

15

slavishly, blindly apply this statute, then it would go

16

on and on and on forever until paid.

17

QUESTION;

But if

The harsh terms of the district

court’s finding, apparently tasked in terms of the

That’s true, they did not reverse

4

the decision of Judge Justice and reinstitute the

5

penalty.

6

If the Court please, might I just call

7

attention to another statute which this Court has

8

interpreted that I think justifies our position in this

9

case that the court has discretion in interpreting the

10

statute.

11

the liability of an employer for compensation under that

12

Act shall be exclusive and in place of all other

13

liability to the injured longshoreman or anyone entiled

14

to recover compensation under that longshoreman.

15

when you read that statute, the literal wording of the

16

statute, you read it clearly, that’s what it says and

17

that’s all it says.

18

Section 5 of the Longshore Act provides that

Yet

--

Yet this Court in Reid against Yaka and in

19

Jackson versus Ly'kes Brothers held that where a

20

longshoreman is employed directly by a

21

compensation-paying employer who is also a shipowner,

22

then the shipowner is not immune from tort liability and

23

the longshoreman may sue the shipowner directly for

24

damages under the general maritime law.

25

Specifically, those cases held that he had a

51

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-234o

1

cause of action for damages for unseaworthiness.

2

that statute was amended in 1972 and the longshoreman's

3

remedy for unseaworthiness was eliminated.

4

time the appellata courts have held that the

5

longshoreman nevertheless still retains his direct

6

action against his employer under the principles of

7

maritime negligence so long as the quality of the

8

negligence that causes the accident is negligence in the

9

navigation of the vessel.

Now,

Since that

Courts have distinguished

10

negligence in loading the cargo on the vessel, which is

11

normally longshore work, and navigation of the vessel,

12

which is operation of the ship.

13

And I cite those cases to you simply to

14

reaffirm that, although the literal wording of the

15

statute in question may say that the two days wages or

16

the double wages are payable until paid, certainly this

17

longshore statute shows clearly that this Court and

18

other federal courts obviously have the right to

19

interpret these statutes to divine the intent of

20

Congress.

21

I think the history of this statute indicates

22

that Congress -intended to turn j its administration over

23

to the federal admiralty courts, and if Congress had

24

been dissatisfied with it it would have amended the

25

statute, because for many years these cases have been on

MR. GOLLER;

Incidentally, if I may refer back

to Pacific Mail against Schmidt, in that case the Court

held that there was grave doubt as to whether or not the

QUESTION;

Well, lour Honors --

Is there anything in the

to do both?

One, it removed the limit on his

discretion.

Did it also entirely take away the

discretion?

HR. CHAFFIN;

Oh, Your Honor, the statute was

clear on its face saying that he could not exceed ten
