ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND K. TRENT, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8

MR. TRENT;

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

10 the Court;
11

This case comes before this Court on a

12 cross-petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals
13 for the Third Circuit, brought by the Appellants there,
14 Defendants in the District Court for the Western
15 District of Pennsylvania.

The pleading in suit was the

16 second count of the complaint by the Plaintiff, the
17 Compagnie des Bauxite de Guinee, a non-Pennsylvania
18 corporation, against a number of Defendants, including
19 the

14 Cross-Petitioners, non-Pennsylvania insurance

20 companies -- Indeed, they were non-American insurance
\

21 companies — on contracts of insurance made in London
22 insuring a risk in
23

Africa.

The Defendants pleaded lack of personal

24 jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss for want of
25 personal jurisdiction.

The Plaintiff requested the

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Defendants to produce their insurance policies covering

2 Pennsylvania insureds, Pennsylvania risks, and emanating
3 from brokers in Pennsylvania.

At the hearing before the district judge on

4
5 the motion

to dismiss and on the Defendants* objections

6 to the reguest for documents, the counsel for the
7 Defendant insurers,

two young people from New York at

8 the time, pointed out to the court that the Defendants

9 did not have copies of their policies in their
10 possession.
11

The contracts of insurance consisted of for

the most part each contract a single piece of paper

12 called a placing slip, where the terms of the risk were
13 summarized in shorthand form, abbreviated form,
14 accordance with

the practice in London.

And so then the district court said, well —

15
16 oh

in

— the Defendants* counsel said;

17 hands of about
18 British

These are in the

150 brokers in London.

According to

practice, the broker is not the agent of the

19 insurance company,

but the agent of the insured or the

20 prospective insured seeking insurance.
21

And so the district judge said, request them

22 from the brokers.
23 went to

New York counsel for the insurers

England to see what he could find out about

24 these things.

In effect, he undertook to do what the

25 court had ordered him to do.

And he found there that

4

sw

WASHiNRTnN n n onnoA (ono\ RSA-orus

1 there were about four million files involved in these
2 policies, because the insurers did not have indexes
3 relating to Pennsylvania.

Their indexes were based on

4 large geographical areas.

The continent of North

5 America was the smallest group that they had.
6

And so he came back, and, within the time

7 allowed by the court as extended for 30 days, he filed
8 an affidavit offering to produce all the Defendants' own
9 records, these placing slips, at their places where they
10 were kept in England, mostly in London, and for one of
11 the Defendants in Tel Aviv, where its records were

12 kept.
13

At the hearing — oh, the Plaintiff then filed

14 a motion to compel, and at the hearing on that motion

15 the district judge said, I'll give you another 60 days
16 to get these policies from the brokers.
17

QUESTION;

Did the district court at that

18 time, Mr. Trent, say where the production should take

19 place?
20

NS. TRENT:

Not expressly, no.

But the

21 request for documents asked for them to be brought to

22 the office of Plaintiff's counsel in Pittsburgh, and it
23 was assumed that that's where they were to be produced.
24

QUESTION:

Is that disputed at all or does

25 everybody agree?

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. TRENT;

I think everyone agrees on that.

2 There was no specific statement by the court that they
3 should be produced in Pittsburgh,
4 it

but everyone assumed

because the reguest for documents said to produce

5 them at

the office of Plaintiff's counsel in

6 Pittsburgh.
7

QUESTION:

Counsel, insofar as I was able to

8 determine reading the briefs, the Defendants at trial
9 indicated that that

would basically be possible; it was

10 a question of when, not if.
11
12 mean?

MR. TRENT:

Is that right?

To produce in Pittsburgh, you

Well, it would be possible, yes, to bring 4,000,

13 four million files to Pittsburgh.
14 matter I would say no.

But as a practical

I question even whether Hercule

15 could do such a thing, and we have no one of his
16 calliber on our staff.

17 impossible.
18

As a practical matter, it was

When —

QUESTION;

And that position was articulated

19 at all times before the district court?
20

MR. TRENT:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TRENT:

Yes.

It was not --

That it was impossible physically?
Well, I can’t say that it was

23 expressly said, but it would seem to me that it's just
24 obvious that you can't bring four million files across
25 the ocean as a practical matter.

And that was the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 position that we took.
2

Now, then the district court gave the

3 Defendants another 60 days to get the policies from the
4 brokers in London.

The Defendants then sent letters to

5 roughly 150 brokers, and the brokers answered that it
6 was impossible for them to get these policies out of
7 their files or that it was impossible to do it within
8 the time limit, which was a little less than 60 days by
9 the time they got the request.

So that there they were

10 taking the definite position that it was impossible
11 because

their files too were not indexed according to

12 the states in the United States.
13

After that the Plaintiffs filed a motion for

14 sanctions to have the court find that the Defendants
15 were subject to jurisdiction in

Pennsylvania.

While

16 that motion was pending, the Defendants, based on some
17 newly discovered

evidence which they had received a few

18 months before, filed an action in London for a
19 declaratory

judgment that they had the right to avoid,

20 as the British term is, to rescind the contract, because
21 of

the failure of the Plaintiff to disclose material

22 information at the time they asked the Defendants to
23 assume the risk.
24

The Plaintiff then filed a motion to enjoin

25 that London action,

and at the hearing on the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 preliminary injunction the district court entered a
2 sanction, finding the Defendants subject to jurisdiction
3 and entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the
4 action in London.

About two months later, on the

5 Plaintiff's motion he entered orders saying that the
6 jurisdictional finding is conclusive, there shall be no
7 discovery on jurisdiction and no testimony on it at the
8 permanent injunction hearing.
9

Then on appeal to the Court of Appeals, the

10 Third Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Aldisert, reversed
11 the injunction, but affirmed on the jurisdiction.

12 Plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari on the
13 injunction, which is still pending, and the Defendants
14 filed a cross-petition on the jurisdiction, which Your
15 Honors granted.
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Trent, before you get into your

17 argument could I ask just perhaps kind of a stupid

18 question?

What is the position of these British

19 insurance companies as to where they should properly be

20 sued?
21

22 London.
23

MR. TRENT:

Where they should be sued?

In

The custom over there is that if -QUESTION:

That if an American company enters

24 into an insurance — gets insurance from an English
25 company, they're expected to sue in London?

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. TRENT*

1

Yes, because the way that the

2 insurance is placed, it's the broker in
3 the contract with

5 subject

And they wouldn't even have been

to suit in West Africa, either?
NR. TRENT*

6
7 placing

the insurer there.

QUESTION*

4

London who makes

No, unless it's stated on the

slip, it's assumed that it will be in London.

8 Now, in the present case the insurers,

the underwriters

9 who accepted the contract for the insurers thought that
0 this was a

Guinean company in Africa.

They had no

11 knowledge at all that the Plaintiff was a Delaware
2 corporation.

Its name being in French and French being

13 the language in the Republic of Guinea, they thought it
14 was a Guinean risk.
5

As a matter of fact, the testimony was they

6 thought

they were reinsuring a Guinean company, because

7 many of

the countries there have preference for their

18 own insurance companies and the London companies then
9 reinsure them.
20

The Court of Appeals in — well, I should say

21 that the question is then whether the sanction was
22 proper.

The Court of Appeals held that it — no.

And

23 we say that depends on two things, whether a court can
24 make a sanction, make an order requiring discovery and
25 impose a sanction for not obeying before the court has

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

found the Defendants subject to personal jurisdiction;

2 and second, that the order in this case, the sanction
3 order, is valid only if the discovery order is valid,
4 and a discovery order requiring us to bring four million
5 files from London to Pittsburgh is a complete abuse of
6 discretion, it's impossible.
7

The Defendants could not comply with it and

8 therefore they didn't willfully disobey it.
9 impossible to obey.

It was just

And there's not a shred of evidence

10 in the record that the young New York lawyers who were
11 handling the matter were contumacious in any way.

They

12 were trying to do what the court wanted them to do, and
13 when they —
14

QUESTION;

Mr. Trent, that's I think the third

15 time you've used the phrase "young New York lawyers."

I

16 take it you wish in some way to disassociate yourself
17 from —
18

MR. TRENT;

Well, I beg Your Honor's pardon.

19 I was in effect excusing them because of their lack of
20 experience.

They are very nice people.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. TRENT;

Excusing them for what?
For not immediately saying, we

23 will produce these things in London.

They first — they

24 tried to get —
25

QUESTION;

But they did have authority to

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 represent your clients at the time?
HR. TRENT:

2

Oh, absolutely.

They were in

3 charge of the case.

QUESTION:

4

And we must presume they are duly

5 admitted and competent lawyers, even though they’re
6 young.
7

HR. TRENT;

8

QUESTION;

That’s right, Your Honor.

Now —

Counsel, was the court’s order to

9 produce only the files on policies issued by these
10 companies to people in Pennsylvania,

or was the order to

11 produce all four million files?
HR. TRENT;

12

The order was to produce the

13 Pennsylvania policies, but in order to do that the
14 brokers in London and the Defendants in London would
15 have had to go through four million files to see which
16 ones related to Pennsylvania.

Now, in the course of one of the hearings,

17

18 arguments in court,
19 Well,

the lawyer from New York said;

suppose we admit that we're doing one percent, we

20 get one percent of our income from Pennsylvania.
21 that satisfy?

Will

And Hr. Mellott for the Plaintiffs said:

22 No, I will not take your word for that.

I want to see

23 all the records to make sure that you’re showing them
24 all to us.
25

So we would have had to bring four million

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 files over, even if we had been able to sort out just
2 the Pennsylvania ones, because Mr. Mellott was not
3 willing to accept the representation —
4

QUESTION!

But that was not the court's order.

5 in any event?
6

MR. TRENT;

No, the court’s order was just the

7 Pennsylvania files, that's right.
8

QUESTION;

How much easier would it have been

9 to get into these records in London once they're
10 identified?
11
12 available.

MR. TRENT;

Oh, they're there.

They're all

It would be just a matter for the

13 Plaintiffs* counsel to go and look at them and see.
i

He

14 would have to dig it out, and the cases say that the
15 party seeking discovery has to bear the burden of
16 whatever work it is to find what he wants.
17

QUESTION;

Mr. Trent, if I find myself unable

18 to excuse what these lawyers did because they’re young
19 lawyers from New York, do you lose?
20

MR. TRENT;

21

QUESTION;

If you do not excuse them?
If I find that I just can't excuse

22 them

-

23

MR. TRENT;

24

QUESTION;

Cannot excuse them —
— because they're young and

25 inexperienced —

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SB. TRENT:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TRENT:

Hell, I don't think that would
— do you lose?
No, I wouldn't think I would lose

4 on that.
5

QUESTION:

6

MR. TRENT:

All right.

Hell, you act like it.

Well, I beg your pardon.

I was

7 trying to in effect explain what took place.
8

QUESTION:

I took it that your reference to

9 these young men was to indicate that there was no
10 deliberate, there was no contumacious conduct on their
11 part.

12
13 Honor.

MR. TRENT:

Right, right, exactly, Your

That's true and that's correct, and I don't

14 think the other side contends that there was.

Their

15 principal basis is that we just did not produce the

16 records in Pittsburgh.
17

Now, on the Court of Appeals Judge Aldisert --

18 there's a split of authority in the circuits.

The

19 latest case before this one was the case in the Fifth

20 Circuit, Familia de Boom v. Arosa Mercantil in the
21 Southern District of Texas,

where the district court had

22 dismissed an action because the plaintiff lid not comply
23 with — answer interrogatories.

And the Fifth Circuit

24 reversed that and said you cannot make an order
25 requiring them to answer interrogatories until you first

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 have jurisdiction over them
2

The second ground for the Court of Appeals

3 ruling here was that -- Judge Aldisert admitted that the
4 general rule is that where the documents are voluminous
5 the party seeking — wanting to look at them must go
6 where they are.

But he said that's a matter of

7 discretion for the district court and we cannot find
8 that — we can't say we disagree with it.
9

Now, we say that that is completely wrong,

10 that it was an abuse of discretion to require us to
11 bring four million files over to America,

and we’ve

12 cited cases in the brief that support that.
13

QUESTIONS

Would it not have been compliance

14 with the order for your people in London to search
15 through the files and found those that showed American
16 business and just brought those?
17

MR. TRENT;

Yes, but that would have been a

18 Herculean task, because they had no indexes.
19 have had to

20

They would

examine —

QUESTION;

Well, you said a moment ago that if

21 Plaintiff’s counsel went over the files would be

22 available to them.

But it would also be a Herculean

23 task for the Plaintiff's counsel.
24
25 the

MR. TRENT;

Yes, that’s right.

And because

Plaintiff is seeking the information, the Plaintiff

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 must bear the burden of that.
QUESTION:

2

And there is no way in which these

3 companies can find any shortcuts to know how much
4 business they’ve done in Pennsylvania,
5

*

MR. TRENT:

I guess?

Well, two of them by — or some of

6 them, by taking files for a limited period, part of the
7 period — the period

8 years.
9 and

they asked for was about six

They took part of a year or a year or something,

then they made estimates, and they all said, well,

10 we don't do more than one percent.
11

QUESTION:

12 one percent?
13

How would they even know about the

That’s what puzzles me.

MR. TRENT:

14 general feeling of

15

That was —

Well, I think that was just the

the underwriters.

QUESTION:

I mean, I’d assume there’d be some

16 executives who would remember some policies that came

17 from —
18

MR. TRENT:

Oh, I think they could have

19 remembered some particular ones, but that wouldn't
20 satisfy the Plaintiff.

21

QUESTION:

And by taking —

There was no attempt to sort of

22 say, well, maybe we — if we give you everything we can
23 find in the first few days of search or something.
24 Sometimes these things can be worked out.
25

MR. TRENT:

Yes.

Well, that was where they

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

got their one percent, by looking at a short period.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TRENT:

Yes.
But there was never any proposal

4 by the Plaintiffs to accept something like that.

They

5 wanted the whole thing and they wanted to look at every
6 paper in the file to make sure we weren't withholding
7 some.

So as I see it, the way these things ought to

8

9 be handled is if there's no jurisdiction — until
10 jurisdiction is found,

there's no power in the court to

11 enter any sort of order against a defendant.
12 plaintiff is not without a

remedy there.

13 of the things Judge Aldisert said,
14 to do this,

But the

That was one

that it was necessary

otherwise how can the Plaintiff prove his

15 case of jurisdiction.

All they had to do was to initiate discovery

16

17 against us as non-parties.
18 that.

The British statute permits

We would have had to produce our documents

19 pursuant to subpoena in London,

and then they could have

20 looked at them.
21

Now, as a practical matter we weren't going to

22 insist on that.
23 see them.
24 brokers'

We said, sure, come over, we'll let you

And if they then wanted to look at the
records also, they could have subpoenaed them.

25 But I think the brokers would have let them come and

16

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 look at them.

They — except for, one of the brokers

3 object to producing

them as such.

4 it was just such a terrible

QUESTION:

The others did not

job to do.

Well, it's your position, then,

6 that the extreme nature of the discovery required by the
7 district court, as you regard it,

really doesn’t have

8 any bearing on this case, because I take it you would
9 have objected on your jurisisdictional argument to even
10 requiring one witness who resided in

Pittsburgh to be

11 deposed on the jurisdictional issue.
12

SB. TRENT:

13 to do that.
14 they wanted

15

Yes, yes.

Well, we had the right

I can’t say that I would have objected if
to take one.

Now, I have said in one part of my argument

16 that these files in

the — policies on the brokers’

17 possession were not subject to our control.
18 practical matter they were not,

As a

because the brokers

19 would not produce them, although I think we had a legal
20 right to get them from the broker.

After all, when the

21 insurance company writes insurance and signs a policy
22 and the broker keeps it, the insurance company has a
23 right to get that.
24

But the general rule in the law is that if a

25 party which has control of another's documents, a

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 non-party to the action has control of the documents of
2 a party and the party says, please give them to me, and
3 the person with custody says, no, I won’t, then it*s up
4 to the other party to the case who wants them to go
5 after that party who has the custody.
6 cases on that.

And I cited some

Because they wouldn't produce them for

7 us.
8

So — I started to say that the best way to

9 resolve this would be if there is a — jurisdiction is
10 contested and then the party asserting jurisdiction
11 would file affidavits and the other one would file

12 affidavits.

And if they're conflicting, then you cannot

13 -- you could dismiss the motion to dimiss.
14 deny

You could

the motion to dismiss, but you couldn't grant it on

15 conflicting affidavits.

You would have to hold a

16 hearing, and that I think should have been done.
17

Judge Simmons in the district court should

18 have held a hearing and tried to resolve, to see whether
19 there would

be evidence to support a finding of

20 jurisdiction, and then he could order discovery to get
21 more evidence.

But he didn't do that.

At the same time

22 as he made his injunction order, he entered a sanction
23 and

we had no opportunity, then, to try to comply with

24 the sanction.
25

I would like to reserve the remainder of my

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLOYD R. MELLOTT, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. MELLOTT;

6

Mr. Chief Justice and if it

7 please the Courts
It is the position of the Cross-Respondent

8

9 that when a party to a litigation in a federal court
10 comes into the court and asks for a binding
11 determination of no

jurisdiction — and incidentally, it

12 was not a motion to

dismiss under 12(b) that was filed

13 here.

It was a motion for summary judgment that was

14 filed 18 months after the action was commenced.

Motion

15 for summary judgment was filed asking the court to
16 determine -- make a binding determination that there was
17 no personal jurisdiction over 17 of the excess
18 insurers.
19

Now, not only did the excess insurers come

20 into court and ask for that action by the court;

the

21 excess insurers took advantage of the discovery rules

22 themselves.

They served us with a request for

23 production of documents.
24

QUESTION;

25

MR. MELLOTT;

They served us —

How many documents?
Well, they asked us to produce

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 policies which they had issued to CBG or to Halco or to
2 another affiliated company, and to produce policies
3 which had been referred to in an affidavit of Marsh £1
4 McLennan, policies which Marsh £ McLennan, a broker in
5 Pittsburgh, had written for either Halco, CBG — and
6 when I say CBG I mean the Cross-Respondent here — or
7 Alcoa, in which Marsh £ McLennan state in the affidavit
8 during a period, I believe, from 1971 until 1975, when
9 the lawsuit was filed, they had written numerous
10 policies for each of the excess insurers here involved,
11

and they list them by number -- it appears in the

12 appendix, four Honors — setting forth the number of
13 contacts that they'd had in Pennsylvania.
14

When we tried to obtain additional information

15 concerning policies written for other companies, we of
16 course were unable to get them from Marsh £ McLennan.
17

QUESTION*

Mr. Mellott, it was never clear to

18 me reading the briefs whether it was your position in
19 the lawsuit

that your clients had jurisdiction because

20 of the Pennsylvania contacts related to these particular
21 policies alone,

or whether it was your position that

22 there was jurisdiction because the original Defendants
23 had done so much business in Pennsylvania that there was
24 general jurisdiction.
25

MR. MELLOTT;

Justice — excuse me.

I didn't

1 mean to interrupt
2

It was our position that we had jurisdiction

3 on several grounds, and Judge Simmons so found in his
4 preliminary findings and in the findings on the
5 permanent injunction.

We contended, first of all, that

6 there was sufficient contacts in this particular
7 transaction .

8

I find myself disagreeing completely with the

9 statement of facts which Mr. Trent has stated to this
10 Court and I think the record will support -11

QUESTION;

Well, if you were willing to rest

12 on that you wouldn’t need all these four million files.
13

MR. MELLOTT;

Your Honor, we also contended

14 that they had conducted sufficient other business in
15 Pennsylvania so as to meet the tests under International
16 Shoe and other cases which this Court has decided.

And

17 we contended that they had adopted the primary policy.
18

You see, we have a policy covering the first

19 $10 million of loss with INA insurance company in
20 Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania.

The excess insurers do

21 not deny that they adopted the terms of the primary
22 policy.

But they would have us sue INA in Pennsylvania

23 and them, at least some of them, in London and one of
24 them in Brussels.
25

We submit that when they adopted the terms of

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the primary policy they were subject to suit where the
2 primary insurer was subject to suit.

We also contend

3 that there was an implied term in the policy that they
4 would consent to suit in Pennsylvania.

Other policies

5 — and they’re listed in the record — other policies
6 had been issued to my client previously in which most of
7 the excess insurers were involved, in which there was a
8 consent to suit clause, anywhere.
9

QUESTION:

If there is an implied term in the

10 policy, why is there any need for an express consent to
11 suit clause?
12

HR. HELLOTTi

Well, Your Honor, obviously I

13 was trying to prove jurisdiction on one of several
)

14 grounds, and the Defendants were contending that they
15 didn’t do enough business here -- or in Pennsylvania —
16 to be subject to suit there.

And it seemed to me that

17 when they're coming into court and asking the court to
18 make a binding determination of no jurisdiction on the
19 ground that they don *t have sufficient contacts in
20 Pennsylvania to satisfy the tests under International
21 Shoe, that by doing so they’ve at least agreed to
CM
CM

produce or consented to the jurisdiction of the court to

23 produce those facts which are relevant to that
-

24 determination.
25

Otherwise it seems to me. Your Honors, it's a

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 complete abuse of our judicial process.

Furthermore,

2 there is evidence in the record, contrary to what Mr.
3 Trent says, that the excess insurers knew that INA was
4 the company that had written the primary insurance, that
5 they knew of the contact with Pennsylvania.

We have

6 affidavits from the brokers, we have testimony on
7 depositions.
8

The excess layer was $10 million.

40 percent

9 of that was reinsured with INA Reinsurance in Brussels.
10 The same London broker who the excess insurers would
11 have this Court believe for all purposes is the agent of

12 my client, at the same time they were negotiating the
13 excess layer of coverage, they were also negotiating the
14 reinsurance, not for my clients but for the excess
15 insurers, with INA Reinsurance in Brussels.

That

16 company took 40 percent of this excess layer of $10
17 million.

18

That company is an affiliated company with the

19 primary carrier.

That company had full information in

20 its files, furnished by the broker, concerning CBG, its
21 U.S. connection, the fact it was a Delaware corporation,

22 who its owners were, completely consistent with the
23 affidavit of the London brokers as to what they had in
24 their files and what was available for the excess
25 insurers to see.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Now, if they gave it to the reinsurance

1

2 company, I submit there is reason to believe it was also
3 given to all of the excess insurers.
4

There are a lot of other misstatements of fact

5 which appear in the brief and which were repeated here
6 again today.

Now, the only way that I can explain it is

7 that Mr. Trent came into this

case some time after the

8 sanctions were entered.

been in the case from the

I *ve

9 beginning.
10
11 of

There was never a question at any time in any
the proceedings as to whether the documents had to be

12 produced in Pittsburgh or in London.

There was never an

13 objection made by the excess insurers on that basis.
14 never refused to go to London to look at documents.

I
The

15 court never really ordered them to produce them in
16 Pittsburgh.
17

As a matter of fact, as Mr. Trent should know,

18 I went to

London and to Europe, to Brussels, both before

19 and after

this offer that was

made four months after

20 they were ordered to produce the documents, to look at
21 documents when

22

the documents were produced.

What did happen here?

A motion -- after they

23 filed the motion for summary judgment claiming no in
24 personam

jurisdiction because, they said, they didn't

25 have sufficient contact -- the fact is they had

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 initially filed affidavits in connection with the motion
2 for summary judgment in which all 17 denied any business
3 in Pennsylvania.

But after we filed counter-affidavits

4 establishing business to the extent that we were able to
5 prove it, they filed new affidavits, in

13 of which

6 these excess insurers acknowledge under oath that they
7 are engaged in writing insurance and covering risks on a
8 worldwide basis.
9

They don't exclude Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania

10 is a rather commercial state, with a lot of industries
11 that are engaged in business worldwide.

In some of

12 these affidavits we find representations that they
13 conducted -- that they had reviewed some of their files
14 and that they had determined that certain percentages,
15 either one percent more or less, had been determined to
16 be derived from Pennsylvania.
17

Now, that's not just in a representation of

18 counsel, as I understood Mr. Trent to indicate to the
19 Court previously.

It is in signed, sworn affidavits of

20 the excess insurers.
21

Justice Stevens, I believe asked the question

22 about, how did they know.
23 the

Well, presumably, at least

representation made to the court was that the files

24 had been reviewed

to support the affidavit, not that

25 they had some general understanding out of the air.

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Now, it may be, and I submit should be, that

1

2 one percent of their premium income, which in all
3 probability runs into the millions of dollars, is enough
4 contact with Pennsylvania to meet the test of
5 International Shoe.

And when they -- when we were in

6 court and they asked whether that wasn't adequate,
7 whether I wasn’t satisfied with that, I said that if you
8 are still contending that that extent of business does
9 not meet the regularity test then I want you to produce
10 the documents, as you were originally ordered to do.
And they said, what difference — the lawyer

11

12 said, what difference does it make whether it’s one or
13 two

percent?

Well, I offered to withdraw the request

14 for production of documents if they would acknowledge

15 that the one or two percent of their business was
16 sufficient to meet the tests of the Pennsylvania long
17 arm statute and the requirement

of International Shoe.

They were not willing to do that.

18

19 contended that the contacts

They still

were not adequate.

Now,

20 they were originally ordered to produce, on July 27th,
21 1978.
22

Mr. Trent would have you believe, and in fact

23 says so

in his brief and in his reply brief and

24 intimated it again
25 York,

today, that the lawyers from New

who are experienced insurance lawyers in the

In fact, that's what he

There's no citation to the record

4 for that.
5

QUESTIONS

Counsel, do you agree with Hr.

6 Trent that the order to produce did contemplate

7 production in Pittsburgh?
8

HR. HELLOTT*

9

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

Where do you think it contemplated

10 production?
11

HR. HELLOTTs

12 was never settled.

Your Honor, I think that matter

They never objected.

At any time

13 there was any discussion about this matter on the
14 record, Your Honor, they never objected that it was the
15 burden to bring it to Pittsburgh.

That's not in their

16 objections.
17

The burdensomeness that they objected to was

18 the collection of the documents.

The only objections in

19 the record to this production, contrary to what Hr.
20 Trent has indicated in his brief and again today, are
21 objections as to relevancy — I think it's clearly
22 relevant — and objections as to burdensomeness from the
23 standpoint of having to contact the brokers to get the
24 documents.
25

QUESTION;

Well, but if as you say there

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 really was no place for production specified, then they
2 would have had no occasion to get into the question of
3 whether it was too burdensome to bring it, once it had
4 been assembled, from London to Pittsburgh.
5

MR. MELLOTT:

Well, Your Honor, in the order

6 which the judge entered there was no provision for the
7 place of production.

And we had gone to London

8 previously to look at documents.

We were perfectly

9 willing to go again, and I'm sure the lawyers so
10 understood.
11

That to me is a red herring that's come into

12 the case after the sanctions were entered.
13 something that was involved at all.

to contact brokers, there were 150 brokers
In fact, they had filed an affidavit earlier

21 that day in which

they said there'd be 150 brokers

22 involved and .it would require contacts.
23

The judge suggested that a letter be written

24 to the brokers, a form letter.

This is in July.

And

25 there was no objection at that time that they were

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

outside of the control of the excess insurers.

2 the letter finally written to the brokers?
3

When was

Six months

later, in January 1979.
Even though at the July hearing their counsel

4
5

is saying, the documents you want are in the hands of

6

the brokers, they're not saying, however, that they're

7

outside their control — and if I understood Mr. Trent

8 today, he's now not suggesting that either, because I
9

think clearly they are not outside the control of the

10

excess insurers — instead of immediately going to

11

London, as Mr. Trent indicates in his brief, and in his

12

reply brief, and again today, they admitted five months

13

later at the December hearing that they hadn't contacted

14

even one broker, five months after they had been ordered

15

to do it.
As a matter of fact, they had only contacted

15 of their 21 clients.

They hadn't even contacted all

MR. MELLOTTi

Your Honor, prior to the time

25 that the sanction was entered, except for the offer to

1 produce four million files — and while it's been
2 characterized in the brief and here today as being a
3 list of the North

American files, it was never so

4 identified to us, nor was it so

identified in any of the

5 papers or in any of the discussions.
6

All it was was an indication to us that they

7 would open the files of 15 of the excess insurers.
8 That’s were the four million files were supposed to be
9 located.

At the same time they're telling us that the

10 files are in the hands — the documents that they were
11 ordered to produce are in the hands of the brokers.

So

12 these four million files may or may not contain what
13 they were ordered to produce.
14

QUESTION;

Well,

time is getting away and I

15 have two questions —
16

MR. MELLOTT:

All right.

17

QUESTION;

18 address.

And one is the question of whether it was an

— I’d really like to hear you

19 abuse of discretion for the court to order the
20 production of four million files.

And secondly, if not

21 and if the court could properly impose sanctions in this
22 discovery effort, was it an abuse of the court's
23 discretion to prevent any further litigation of that
24 problem at the trial on the merits, the jurisdictional
25 question?

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ME. MELLOTT;

1

Your Honor, in the first place,

2 Judge Simmons did not order the production of these four
3 million files.

He ordered — and he changed our request

4 after the counsel for the excess insurers had presented
5 arguments.

All they were ordered to do was to give us

6 names of the policies,

the policy numbers and the

7 general outline of those policies which had a
8 Pennsylvania contact,

either by being written for a

9 Pennsylvania insured, being written through a
10 Pennsylvania broker, or covering a risk in
11 Pennsylvania.

12

Now, that's what they were ordered to do.

I

13 submit, Your Honor, that when they made this offer, four
14 months after they had been originally ordered to
15 produce, it was not an offer that complied with what
16 they'd been ordered to do.

I mean, on the one hand

17 they're telling us they don't have the files, they're

18 with the brokers -- although they never said that they
19 were outside their control — I

mean, that they didn't

20 have the documents.
21

On the other hand, after coming to the court

22 at the end of the 90 days, asking for an extension of
23 time and

representing to the court that in all

24 probability
25 30 days, and

we can comply with the court's order within
the court granted ah extension of an

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 additional 30 days, all we get is a two-page affidavit,
2 the end of November, four months later, which simply
3 says 15 of the companies will open their files.
4

Now, those are not the documents the court

5 ordered produced.

There was not even any representation

6 that those included the documents which were produced.
7 In fact, if you believe them when they say that the
8 documents that we were requesting were in the possession
9 of the brokers, those files didn't even include any of
10 them.
11

QUESTION:

If we assume for a moment that the

12 court had the power to enter some sanction and to compel
13 discovery for the purpose of reviewing its own in
)

14 personam jurisdiction, do you think the court also
15 properly precluded any further consideration of that
16 issue at trial?
17

MR. MELLOTT:

Well, I think the court did.

18 Your Honor, and I think by virtue of the holding of this
19 Court in the National Hockey League case that's
20 required.

If sanctions are going to mean anything and

21 have any deterring effect, you can't say that once the
22 sanction has been entered it can be removed by
23 compliance later.
>

All that'll do is bring about a

24 complete abuse of the discovery process.
25

QUESTION:

That doesn't necessarily follow, it

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 seems to me.

Haybe this particular sanction was not the

2 correct one.

Maybe there should have been a monetary

3 sanction based on all of your time and energy and
4 interest and all the rest, and delay.

Wouldn't that

5 serve a deterrent purpose?
6

MR. MELLOTT:

Your Honor, I submit that it was

7 not — and I'm not even sure that it's the case today.
8 The Defendants haven't even today, so far as I know,
9 offered to produce the documents which they were ordered
10 to produce.

Now, Mr. Trent after he got into the case

11 made a new offer, and it's not clear from the offer

12 whether he's talking about producing the documents
13 including those from

the brokers or whether he's talking

14 about the same four million files.

But in any event. Your Honor, I don't agree

15

16 with what Mr. Trent said about my view as to whether the
17 lawyers acted in good faith or not.

18 they acted in good faith.
19 good faith,

I do not believe

I think they did not act in

as the Third Circuit found.

find I think a

20 review of the record will make it very clear here they
21 did

not act in good faith.

22

And the judge gave them nine months to comply

23 —

25 goes to

It seems to me that all of that

the question of what would be an appropriate

Maybe you're dead right that you were really

2 given a terrible run-around here and entitled to a very
3 severe sanction.

The legal question, thoughs

Is it

4 correct for the sanction to be a finding of jurisdiction
5 when in fact there may be no jurisdiction?
6

MR. MELLOTTs

Well, if Your Honor please, I

7 think if you look at the evidence that's in the record
8 -- and I submit that there is adequate evidence in the
9 record for the court to find jurisdiction even now on
10 the face —

11

Well then, really, you've spent an

12 awful lot of time on an unnecessary project.
MR. MELLOTT:

15 Honor, and -- the suit was filed in December '75.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLOYD R. MELLOTT, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS — RESUMED

MR. MELLOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7 please the Court;

8
9 Justice

I would like to continue with my response to
Stevens* question.

There are three points that

10 I would like to make in response to your question as to
11 whether a money sanction wouldn't have been better.
12 Maybe I haven't phrased it exactly as you did.
13 Honor.

Your

In the money sanction, as I understand it, you

14 were suggesting that they pick

up the expenses that were

15 involved from the delay.
16

I submit. Your Honor, that that type of a

17 sanction would have no deterrent effect on the type of
18 misconduct that was engaged

in here, particularly in a

19 time of high inflation, which we had during the period
20 of dilatory tactics.
21

QUESTION;

You mean deterring other people or

22 being effective in this case?
23

MR. MELLOTT;

Deterring other people. Your

24 Honor.
25

QUESTION;

Hell, what do you care about that?

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 You just want
2

MR. MELLOTT;

Well, what I’m suggesting

3

QUESTIONi

to deter somebody in this case,

MR. MELLOTTi

Well, yes, Your Honor, I'm

4 don't you?
5

6 really primarily concerned in this case.

But I'm

7 suggesting that the sanction that was imposed here is
8 fully in accordance with the provision of Rule
9 37(b)(2)(A), which presumes under that rule that the
10 facts which would be established if the discovery were
11 complied with are deemed to

be established.

And that's

12 exactly what Judge Simmons did, and he did it only after
13 he had warned them, five months after he had originally
14 ordered 'the production, he warned them that if the
15 production

wasn't made in another 60 days the sanction

16 of the type he's mentioned would be entered.
He gave them actually

17

120 days, so that they

18 had a total of nine months to comply.

And they didn't

19 comply.

20

Furthermore, I submit that sanction is in

21 accordance with

the rules and -- the rule, Rule 37, and

22 with the decisions of this Court in the National Hockey
23 League casa,
24 used,

in which the sanction of dismissal was

which is even more severe than the sanction here

25 involved.

At least they still have an opportunity to

Furthermore, I think it's in accordance with

3 the holding of this Court in the Hammond Packing case,
4 in which a sanction of a dismissal —
5

QUESTION;

I'm not so much concerned about the

6 severity of the sanction as the question of the theory
7 by which, if there in fact is no jurisdiction how does
8 the court have power to impose it?
9

HR. KELLOTTs

Hell, Your Honor, on that point,

10 I submit that when a party comes into court and asks the
11

court to make a binding determination that there is no

12 personal jurisdiction over him, and when that party
13 engages in discovery against another party already in
14 the case —

15

QUESTION;

All these arguments are arguments

16 that you didn't really need the discovery that gave rise
17 to

the particular order before us, because those are

18 independent grounds for jurisdiction.
HR. HELLOTT;

19

Hhat I'm saying, Your Honor, is

20 that when they come into court and ask for a binding
21 determination of the court,

as the Fourth Circuit held

22 in the Lekkas case which we've cited in our brief, they
23 are deemed
24 at

to submit to the jurisdiction of the court,

least to the point of providing relevant evidence on

25 the issue that they've asked the court

to decide.

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It seems to me it would be a complete misuse

2 of our judicial process —
3

QUESTION:

Would you mean the court has

4 jurisdiction has to determine its jurisdiction, and that

5 there were efforts, you say, that frustrated the
6 determination of jurisdiction and therefore this drastic
7 step is taken?

8

HR. HELLOTT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

9 mean, it would be a real misuse of process to say on the
10 one hand, as this Court has said, that there is
11 jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction, and that a party
12 can come in and invoke that jurisdiction and yet say:
13 but I'm not going to produce the evidence that's
14 relevant to that determination; you have to decide it on
15 what evidence is in the record; I'm not going to produce
16 the evidence that's in my possession.

17

Now, that's what the excess insurers ask this

18 Court to hold.

19 improper.

I submit that that would be clearly

I also would argue that this is a question —

20 the test here is, did Judge Simmons abuse his discretion
21 in applying this sanction?
22

He warned them that it would be applied.

23 elected not to comply.

They

And as I said this morning, I do

24 not believe that their offer, their belated offer to
25 open files of 15 excess insurers, was a compliance with

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the order to produce certain specific documents which
2 they say are in the hands of the brokers, so they
3 couldn't have been in the files that they were offering
4 to produce in any event.
5

QUESTION;

Does the record show what interest

6 will be payable on the claims when, as and if they’re
7 allowed?
8

MR. MELLOTT;

No, they do not. Your Honor.

9 But we have made a claim and we've amended the complaint
10 to ask for an inflation factor, and the court has
11 permitted

that amendment.

Now, whether we'll be able to

12 sustain it ultimately or not I don't know.
13

QUESTION;

Permitted the amendment?

14

MR. MELLOTT:

The court permitted the

15 amendment only. Your Honor.
16

Your Honor, I believe some of you asked me

17 questions this morning about, why did you go ahead with
18 the discovery if you felt so confident there was
19 jurisdiction.

Well, if this Court holds from the

20 contacts, as I believe it could on the basis of
21

International Shoe, that there's no need for this

22 discovery, that there is sufficient evidence of contacts
23 in the record, as I believe there is, then of course I
24 don't need

the sanction, because there's no appeal from

25 this decision.

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But I felt that I had to assert jurisdiction

2 on every ground available to me, and that's what I tried
3 to do, as long as they were trying to contend that there
4 wasn’t sufficient jurisdiction.
5

QUESTION*

Does the order that was entered

6 here foreclose any further investigation of
7 jurisdiction?
8

MR. MELLOTT:

Yes, it does,, Your Honor,

9 primarily based on the reasoning of this Court in the
10 National Hockey League case.
11

QUESTION*

Was that specifically done under

12 the rule?
13

MR. MELLOTT*

That was done subsequently by an

14 order of court, Your Honor, that in view of the fact

15 that one of the grounds for jurisdiction was that he had
16 imposed a sanction under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) and based on

17 the National Hockey League case, that that issue should
18 not be further litigated.

19

QUESTION:

And so the question of jurisdiction

20 supposedly is no longer open in this case, is that it?
21

MR. MELLOTT:

That's right, Your Honor, on the

22 basis of the reasoning of this Court in the National
23 Hockey League case that if you permit them to avoid the
24 sanction after it's been imposed by then complying with
25 the court order, all you'd get would be dilatory

tactics

2

QUESTION*

You are not now complying with a

3 court order, proving that there isn't jurisdiction.
4 That isn't the same as complying with the order.

5

SR. HELLOTT:

The court actually, in the

6 preliminary injunction order and in the permanent
7 injunction order, found jurisdiction on several
8 grounds.
9
10

QUESTION*

Yes?

MR. MELLOTT:

Including the sanction.

And the

11 court has held that, in view of the entry of the
12 sanction, that the issue of in personam jurisdiction is
13 no longer open for litigation, that it's finally binding
14 on the parties in this case.
15

Now,

the Court of Appeals, I believe

16 incorrectly , dismissed

as to three of the Defendants,

17 and that's part of what is included in our petition for
18 cert to this Court,

which the Court presently has under

19 consideration, because we believe there is adequate
20 evidence of contacts in

the record.

There is also

21 evidence that they did not comply with the order,
22 either.

And our petition for cert also includes the

23 injunction, a point which they -24

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND K. TRENT, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. TRENT«

3

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

4 the Court:
5

One thing Mr. Mellott has just mentioned now

6 and he mentioned as well before lunch, he said that we
7 had asked for a binding determination of jurisdiction,
8 not merely a motion to dismiss.
9 that.

Now, he is incorrect in

On page 38a of the prayer of the affidavit which

10 was filed by the New York lawyers under their New York
11 practice, where they make an affidavit and

contain the

12 motion in it —
13

QUESTION:

That’s 38a of

what?

14

MR. TRENT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. TRENT;

17

"Wherefore, it is respectfully urged that the

Volume one?
Yes.

18 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint
19 against the moving

Defendants on the grounds of lack of

20 in personam jurisdiction and forum non conveniens, be,
21 in all respects,

22
23 lack

granted."

So all he was doing was moving to dismiss for
of jurisdiction.

He did not invoke the

24 jurisdiction of the court by saying it had
25 jurisdiction.

no

I think that’s just a complete

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

contradiction to say that.
Now, ona thing I think has not been clearly

2

3 brought out here is to just what was being asked for in
4 these records.

First, the request for documents asked

5 for the policies, and then the court said at the hearing
6 on that, we'll get up this list in a general way.

And

7 Mr. Mellott then said, I want to see the policies.

And

8 then counsel for the Defendants said that the brokers

9 had the policies, and so mister — Judge Simmons said,
10 well, write to the brokers.

So we understood that we were to get the

11

12 policies.

Then after New York counsel had gone to

13 England to investigate the situation — and Mr.
14 Mellott's correct, he didn’t talk to the brokers, he
15 talked to 15 of his clients, but they knew about the
16 brokers and so forth — he came back and he made this
17 affidavit -- and there's not anything dilatory; he did
18 it within the time -- that it would involve four million
19 files.
20
21

Now, he was talking then about the insurers*
own files, but they would show the same thing as the

22 brokers' files.

That is, the contract is the placing

23 slip and the insurance company keeps that.

The broker,

24 as agent for the insured, then prepares a policy, gives
25 it to the insured to sign and then takes it back and

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

>

1

keeps a copy of it.

So the same information would be in

2 the brokers' files as would be in the insurers' files.

So New York counsel, Mr. Bruckmann, thought,

I

4 well, let us offer our own files and we will make those
5 available.
6

They would show the same thing as the

brokers* files.

7

Now, Mr. Mellott says that we never did offer

8 to produce the documents anywhere.

But after I got into

9 the case, which was after the sanctions had been
10 entered,

I thought, well, let's see if we can get the —

11 offer to produce them now and satisfy the court and be
12 done with it.

And so I expressly offered to produce all

13 these files in London.

>

14

And Mr. Mellott said, no, we're not interested

15 in the files relating to jurisdiction now, and he
16 prepared this order and he submitted it and the judge
17 said he was going to sign it, barring us from ever
18 contesting jurisdiction again.

And I said, on the

19 strength of that I offer to produce all these records in
20 London on July 2nd,

21

1979.

That's right in the record.

So Mr. Mellott is incorrect to say we never

22 did offer to produce the files.

23
'

QUESTION:

You didn't offer to produce them

24 until the sanction had been entered.
25

MR. TRENT:

No — well, that was my offer.

Mr. Trent, did your offer pertain

QUESTION:

Where did I get the notion that the

12

information was only obtainable from the brokers'

13

files?

»

What was all this fussing around about the

brokers* files?

MR. TRENT:

Well, that was because Mr.

Mellott’s request for documents asked for policies, and

17

we did not have any policies in our files.

But

1 They did not have the indexes, either.

QUESTION:

Because I’m puzzled about why you

3 sort of shuttled them off to the brokers.

It probably

4 would have been much more efficient in the first place
5 to stay with your files, wouldn’t it?
6

MB. TRENT;

Well, I think it would have been.

7 But that was Judge Simmons' idea, because they wanted -8 they had asked expressly for the policies and only the
9 brokers had the policies.

11

QUESTION:

And you didn’t — your predecessor

representing your client didn't happen to say, well,

12 really a quicker way to get it would be to look at our
13 own files instead of going through the policies?
14

MR. TRENT:

No.

15 could have been said.

No, that was not said.

That

I don't know whether the realized

16 that or what at the time.
17

QUESTION:

Would you think on your theory of

18 the case or of the rule the district court would have
19 been justified in saying, I’m going to impose — I’m

20 going to find that there is jurisdiction unless you
21

sustain the burden of proof that there isn’t?

22

MR. TRENT:

23

QUESTION:

No.
And that you will have to get your

24 own documents and come in here with proof?
25

MR. TRENT:

No, that was wrong.

I think Judge

MR. TRENT:

QUESTION:

9

MR. TRENT:

10

QUESTION:

When did the judge say that?
I beg your pardon?
When did the judge say that?
He said that -Before he imposed the sanction?
Yes.
So he said to you:

Look, I'm going

11 to find that there's jurisdiction unless you come in and
12 prove
13

MR. TRENT:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, yes, precisely.
Now, that is — and you think that

15 was unjustified?

16

MR. TRENT:

Yes, that was erroneous, because

17 all we have
18

QUESTION:

19 you agree that

Let's assume for the moment that

there had been a refusal to discover.

20 know you say there wasn't.

MR. TRENT:

QUESTION:

23

MR. TRENT*

24

QUESTION:

Yes.
But assume there was.
All right.
And you agree that a sanction, some

25 kind of an effective sanction,

was justified.

You say

48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that sanction would be bad, to put the burden of proof
2 on —
3

MR. TRENT: Yes, yes.

4

QUESTION:

Even though

you

had refused

5 discovery?
6

MR. TRENT: Yes.

7

QUESTION:

And even though

the rule says that

8 you may, as a sanction you may deem the facts sought to
9 have been established?
10

MR. TRENT:

Yes, because we say that doesn't

11 apply where it’s a question of jurisdiction.

And the

12 Familia de Boom case held exactly that, that even though
13 the burden was on the plaintiff to produce the — to
14 prove jurisdiction, if the plaintiff couldn't get it it
15 was too bad, but he should make other efforts.
16

Now, we say, as I said before, that the

17 Plaintiff was not hamstrung here.

All he had to do was

18 go to London and look at our records.
