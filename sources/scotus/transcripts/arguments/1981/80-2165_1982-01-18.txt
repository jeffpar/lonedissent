ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY R. SCHAAF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6

7

MR. SCHAAF;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court, in June of 1977, an individual raped a young lady
9 at a resort in central Nebraska.

One day later, that

10 individual was arrested and bond was set at $10,000.

In

11 September of that year,

Bond

that individual pled guilty.

12 was continued pending sentencing.

Three days later, that

13 same individual, while free on bond,

raped again, and this

14 time killed his victim.
15

In January of that very next year, in 1978, the

16 Nebraska Lesiglature proposed an amendment to Article I,
17 Section 9 of the Nebraska Constitution.

Prior to the time

18 of the proposal of that amendment, Article I, Section 9, had
19 withheld from persons charged with murder and treason the

20 right to demand bail pending trial.

The amendment proposed

21 the addition of the crime of forcible rape.
22
23 people of

At the general election in November of 1978, the
the state of Nebraska, by a vote of 356,000 in

24 favor to 80,000 opposed, adopted this amendment.
25

In May of

1980, Mr. Hunt, the appellee herein, was

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

arrested and charged with multiple counts of forcible rape,

2 and the

commission of that crime with the use of a firearm.

3

In September of 1980, he was convicted of a number of those

4

charges, and sentenced to consecutive terms of confinement

5

of a maximum of 50 years and a minimum of 29.
In June of 1980, he filed in the Federal District

6
7

Court of the District of Nebraska a habeas corpus action

8 naming the judge as the -- excuse me,
9

respondent, and at the same time filed in that court a civil

10 rights action naming Judge Murphy,
11

the sheriff as the

the appellant herein, as

the defendant.
In October of 1980, the United States District

12
13

Court for the District of Nebraska unanimously or -- excuse

14

me -- in both cases, one judge held that that Nebraska

15

constitutional provision was constitutional in all respects.
An appeal was taken to the United States Court of

16
17

Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and in May of 1981, the

18

United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found

19

that in the habeas corpus action the matter was moot, and

20 with
21

reference to the civil rights action, reversed the

lower court, and held that the Nebraska constitutional

22 provision violated
23
24
25

both the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments

to the United States Constitution.
This appeal was thereafter taken.

In October, this

Court noted probable jurisdiction.

QUESTION;

1

Mr. Schaaf, what is the status, if you

2

know, of the appeals in the state court on the convictions

3

them selves?
MR. SCHAAF:

4

Your Honor, the convictions themselves

5

were appealed in both -- in all three cases to the Nebraska

6

Supreme Court, and all three of those appeals are currently

7

pending.

8

It would be expected that that case would not be resolved

9

probably in the next 12 months.

Briefs have not yet been filed by the appellant.

10

Your Honors, a violent crime occurs --

QUESTION:

13

15
16
17

Does the Nebraska Supreme Court not

clear its appellate dockets each term?
MR. SCHAAFs

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

They do

try to give priority to criminal appeals.
QUESTION;

Would it be normal and usual for it to

take 12 months to hear this case?
MR. SCHAAF;

It would not be normal and usual for

18

it to take another additional 12 months from this date to

19

hear this case.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SCHAAF:

That is what I mean.
This is a bit irregular, although I do

22

suspect that the Nebraska Supreme Court is extremely anxious

23

to learn of this Court’s opinion of the constitutionality of

24

our constitutional amendment.

25

bearing on the rapidity with which they are reaching this

It may be that that has some

QUESTION;

Before you leave the Nebraska Supreme

5 Court opinion, the merits don't involve this provision,

do

7

MR. SCHAAF;

8

QUESTION;

Not at all, Your Honor.
Then why would they possibly be waiting

9 for us?
10
11

MR. SCHAAF;

It very well might be that if they

ruled against the appellee in this case, we might have a

12 question of

mootness, Your Honor.

13 struggled with that problem.

The Eighth Circuit

Under Nebraska Press

14 Association versus Stewart, it is our position that so long
15 as Mr. Hunt stands in a position where this matter is
16 capable of repetition, that being if the Nebraska Supreme
17 Court would reverse his convictions and put him back in a
18 position where he was at the inception, he would still be
19 subject to this constitutional amendment, and therefore it
20 is not moot.

QUESTION;

2 might call it?
3

MR. SCHAAF:

I am not certain that the

record

4 reflects whether or not he has the financial means to meet a
5 reasonable bail.
6

QUESTION:

Well, even apart from financial means,

there other grounds on which Nebraska might

that a particular defendant could not make that bond.

But

absent this statute, this constitutional provision, persons

12 charged with heinous crimes such as forcible rape are

With this

provision, the judge is still free to grant

1

QUESTION;

2

NR. SCHAAF;

Has your Supreme Court held this?
The Nebraska Supreme Court has not

3 directly considered that question.

I can suggest to the

4 Court that that is in fact the practice.

I suggest to the

5 Court that the constitutional provision covers murder, not
6 first degree murder, not murder where capital punishment is
7 appropriate, and with great regularity, and for scores of
8 years, persons charged with lesser degrees of murder have
9 been entitled to bail under the same constitutional
10 provision.

There is some suggestion in the amicus briefs

11 that the decision in

Parker versus Roth somehow holds

12 against this position.
13

Parker versus Roth was the first test of this

14 constitutional provision that was taken to the Nebraska
15 Supreme Court.

The Nebraska Supreme Court unanimously

16 upheld the constitutionality of this constitutional
17 amendment.

An appeal was -- petition for a writ of

18 certiorari was taken to this court which was not granted.

1 attention to the concurring opinion of Justice KcCowan in
2 Parker versus Roth,

wherein I think it makes it very clear

3 that it is not an irrebuttable presumption.

I would also

4 direct the Court's attention to the actual language of Chief
5 Justice Krivosha, some of the language that has been cited
6 to you by the amicus, and

in that situation we believe that

7 all the Chief Justice is speaking there is indicta.

9 against bail.

He is

not a prohibition

I think that is a critical element of this

10 case.
11

QUESTION:

Well, has the Nebraska Supreme Court

12 reviewed any cases where bail is denied?

If there is

13 discretion to grant it, has it reviewed any cases where it
14 is denied, and said that the discretion was abused by not
15 granting it?

Or is it just a -- is it ever reviewed?

16

NR. SCHAAFs

17

QUESTION:

18

MR.

Well, bail certainly could be reviewed.
Has it been?

SCHAAF:

It has been in the context of

19 excessive bail, and it has been in one instance in the
20 context of whether
21

or not the court is free to exercise some

discretion, and I guess the citation to that would be

22 Partin, P-a-r-t-i-n,

versus Jensen, 203 Nebraska 441.

23 Partin versus Jensen, 203 Nebraska 441, wherein the Nebraska
24 Supreme Court held the inherent power of a court may be
25 exercised as to bail although it is not specifically vested

QUESTION:

But has it said what factors go into the

3 denial of bail?
4

MR. SCHAAF:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, where -If the Court has got discretion to grant

6 it, I would suppose there may have been some law grow up
7 down through the years, at least on the murder.
8
9 that.

MR. SCHAAF:

No, Your Honor, not with reference to

Now, of course, we do have a statutory scheme for

10 setting bail once bail is to be set.

In other words, to

11 determine, once we have cleared the hurdle of whether or
12 not --

13

QUESTION:

As far as we know, the decision of the

14 trial judge is final with respect to whether bail should be
15 allowed at all or not.
16

MR. SCHAAF:

It is not final, Your Honor.

In this

17 particular case, bail was originally denied by a municipal

18 judge.
19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SCHAAF:

Right.
And that was reviewed by a trial level

21 district court judge.
22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SCHAAF:

Yes.
And thereafter, an appeal is possible

24 to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and that is what happened in

25 Parker versus Roth.

MR. SCHAAF;

When we are talking about persons

5 do.

MR. SCHAAFs

On a case by case basis, they no doubt

They may bring to the court *s attention that this man

6 has a long previous criminal record.

They may bring to the

7 attention of the court that he has not responded -- returned
8 from bond on previous occasions.
9 that they make such a showing.

There is no requirement
If they wish to impose bond,

10 they must astablish that his guilt is evident and the
11 presumption of his guilt great to the trial judge’s
12 satisfaction.

With regard to the irrebuttable presumption,

13 even if they do, the judge may still exercise his discretion
14 to grant bail.

If he makes that election, then there is a

15 statutory procedure he must follow to determine the kind of
16 bail and the amount of bail which would be appropriate.
17 There is no requirement that he articulate the

18 decision-making process of whether or not he will exercise
19 that discretion.

20

QUESTION;

And no requirement expressed, at least,

21 that he inquire into whether or not he has had a past record
22 of not showing up when he has been admitted to bond, or that
23 he is a danger to the community?
24

MR. SCHAAF;

If he feels that he can find that the

25 proof is evident, the presumption is great, without doing

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. HORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

22

the Court, Eugene Hunt was held without bail for a period of

23

four months and three days between the time of his arrest

24

and the commencement of his first trial.

25

because he was charged with the crime of forcible first

degree sexual assault, and upon a finding that the proof was

2 evident and

3

the presumption great by two trial judges.

We have a survey that is contained in the joint

4 appendix that reflects the disposition of these no bail
5 cases during the first year that the constitutional
6 amendment was in effect.

It reflects that there were 32

7 defendants held without bail during the first year that we
8 were able to identify,

9 of.

20 of whose cases had been disposed

Two of these defendants were acquitted by juries after

10

having spent a total of 120 days in jail.

Only one

11

defendant out of those 20 was convicted of the original

12

non-bailable offense.

The remainder had their charges

13 dismissed, or they pled guilty to reduced bailable
14 misdemeanors or felonies.
We think this reflects the injustice of this law,

15

16 the unfairness of this law, the overinclusiveness of this
17 law.
The central issue in this case, we think, is not

18

19 whether the state of Nebraska has a legitimate governmental
20 interest in
21

preventing the crime of rape, which we concede

it does, but whether Eugene Hunt and other defendants

22 charged

with rape have a fundamental right or otherwise

23 constitutionally protected interest in pretrial liberty,
24 which we argue that they do, or even whether preventive
25 detention in general is constitutionally permissible, which
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 we believe is an issue that need not be reached in this
2 case, because Nebraska in fact has not provided for any
3 individual determination of dangerousness by a trial judge.
4 It is simply presumed dangerousness from the nature of the
5 charge, and the weight of the evidence at the time of the
6 initial charge.
7

The central issue is whether the means chosen by

8 the state to promote its legitimate interest.

The means,

9 being denial of pretrial bail to all defendants merely
10 charged with rape where the proof is evident and the
11 presumption great, is substantially related to the
12 effectuation of the state’s legitimate purpose.

of a transcript which is contained in the joint appendix.

2 The proceeding that is contained in the joint appendix was

3 an appeal from the initial denial of bail by a magistrate.

The typical proceeding is that the defendant

5 appears with his counsel and the prosecutor before a
6 magistrate initially.

The charge is read.

The court makes

7 -- sometimes the prosecutor will say a few words about the
8 nature of the case.

The defense attorney may say a few

9 words about the background of the defendant.

The court

According to the statutory scheme, our bail reform
statutes, which were enacted in the early seventies, and are

13 similar to the Federal Bail Reform Act, the defendant, if he
14 is unable to make the fixed bail within 24 hours after it is
15 initially set has a right of review to another judge, a

At that time we

23 nothing about dangerousness.

The statute says

It says nothing about any

24 other factors to be considered other than the risk of
25 non-appearance.

And those were the background factors that

That’s right.

Are those different things, proof

MR. HORNSTEIN;

15

Well, the argument that we make is

16

that that is a meaningless standard, if not

17

unconstitutionally vague under the rule under that we, you

18

know, we stipulated to.

19

is that the Nebraska Supreme Court has never defined that

standard.

standard.

three ordinary burdens of proof.

this country as to what that standard means, one of which

MR. HORNSTEIN:

you delayed filing the briefs

16 it for that purpose, Your Honor.

19

represented to the judge on the bail hearing that he had a

At the time, the evidence that we

22 had available — this was shortly after he was initially -23

the record that was available.

he previously had a statutory rape conviction in another

state that had occurred 12 or 13 years before this.

that information was not given to him by us, and we had no

We think that that is really irrelevant, Your Honor.

Well, Mr. Hornstein , I can understand

your wanting to get a test case, which I guess motivates the

QUESTION;

Well, I gather your basic position is

10 that your 1978 amendment violates the federal Constitution.
11

MR. HORNSTEIN;

12

QUESTION:

That's right.

Tell me, you mentioned earlier the 1789

13 capital crimes exception in the 1789 statute.

Do you think

14 that, under your submission as to the Nebraska provision, do
15 you think that also is unconstitutional?
16

MR. HORNSTEIN:

No, our position is, the capital

17 crimes exception has existed since prior, even, to those
18 provisions that were adopted at the time of the Eill of
19 Rights,

well, at the time of the Judiciary Act.

Blackstone

20 is quoted in the circuit court opinion below in 1770 in his
21 Commentaries on The Laws of England, stating that the
22 rationale for that rule was that a defendant facing the
23 penalty of death could not be assumed to — or he would not
24 appear regardless of what amount of bail was fixed, because
25 the penalty itself would deter his appearance, and that is

24 and everything else, that you do think the capital crimes
25 exception in the 1789 statute is constitutional?

That is another

Other than those two --

Since you concede that, what real

7 difference is there between this Nebraska provision and that
8 one, in

9

terms of constitutionality?
MS. RORNSTEIN;

Well, the difference is that that

10

-- the rationale for that is the threat of capital

11

punishment causing a flight risk which doesn't exist in a

12 non-capital

crime.

This crime in this case, the charges

13 carry penalties of one to 50 years, and the weapons charge,
14 I think, was a consecutive one, 20.

But we have a number of

15 other crimes in Nebraska that carry equal or higher
16 penalties, yet they are all bailable.
17

QUESTION:

So in a state which has abolished

18 capital punishment, it would be your view that then there
19 could be no denial of bail.
20

MR. HORNSTEIN:

That's right.

Our position is that

One of the most recent rights in the Richmond

3 newspaper, the Virginia case that was written by Chief
4 Justice Burger, holding that the right of -- that there was
5 a fundamental right to public access to criminal trials that
6 was implicit in the First Amendment.

Our position is that

7 if a right to bail guaranteed against legislative abuse is
8 not found to be implicit in the Eighth Amendment, then it
9 becomes meaningless, because if the legislature can take
10 away a right that the cause says bail cannot be excessive,
11 and yet if it can be denied by a legislature, that right
12 becomes eviscerated.

If the legislatures are left free to

13 render any crime non-bailable, they can -- theoretically
14 they can choose misdemeanors like petty larseny, drunk
15 driving; any other charge could be rendered non-bailable,
16 which would totally eviscerate the Eighth Amendment
17 excessive bail clause.

18

QUESTION;

May I ask you this, Mr. Hornstein?

If

19 you are right that your constitutional amendment creates an

20 irrebuttable presumption as to people who fell between them,
21 wouldn't you argue, or do you argue that under a due process

22 analysis in any event the provision is unconstitutional,

In fact, it has been suggested to me that even

We suggest that as early as

1628, going through the Habeas

1679 and the Bill of Rights in England in

6 1689, that those provisions were merely enacted

to guarantee

7 the right to bail where it otherwise exists.

It was not

8 meant to create a fundamental right to bail.

It was being

9 abused in England,

and thereafter provision was made so that

10 excessive bail could not be required where it
11

was otherwise

permitted.

12

At the time of the adoption of our federal

13 Constitution,
14 Many of

this particular provision was well known.

the states at that time, at the enactment of the

15 Eighth Amendment,

also had statutory rights to bail.

The

16 inconsistency could not have been missed by the colonial
17 states at that time.

1 comma, on with the clause.

We have no quarrel with that

2 provision as being applicable to the states.
3

QUESTION*

Do you think the Fourteenth Amendment,

4 if we were reviewing it from that aspect, imposes any
5 requirement for an individualized determination, apart from
6 the Eighth Amendment considerations?
7

MR. SCHAAFi

No, Your Honor, we do not.

If in fact

8 it does, however, then we call your attention to the
9 numerous states that have, I believe there are 43 in number,
10 that provide for the withdrawal of the right to bail in
11 capital offenses, yet there is no individualized

12 determination as to the likelihood of their return in many,
13 if not all of those states.

If in fact we are required to

14 determine the likelihood of the recommission of the crime,
15 then are we also required to determine the likelihood of
16 non-return?
17

One point that should be brought out here is that

18 the capital differentiation here, the idea that because it
19 is a capital offense persons are not likely to return, in

20 the state of Nebraska alone no one has been executed in the
21 state of Nebraska since 1959.

The idea that the very fact

22 that it is a capital offense does not serve much of a
23 deterrent or provide much of a reason for fleeing when we
24 haven't put anyone to death since 1959.

QUESTION;

How many do you have on Death Row?

QUESTION;

Then what is the significance of your

MR. SCHAAF;

My comment is that it has not been

The most significant part of that comment is, if

7 we are required to have criteria for determining
8 dangerousness, I think it would also be incumbent, it would
9 follow necessarily then under the same constitutional
10 provision, we are still talking about the same criteria, to
11 have criteria for determining likelihood of return,

12 think most states'

and I

constitutional provisions would fail if

13 subjected to that analysis if in fact that analysis is
14 adopted by this Court.
15

Once again, we are balancing the rights of society

16 under the Fourteenth or any other federal Amendment with the
17 rights of individuals, and we suggest that at this point in

18 time that it is reasonable to conclude, we can examine -19 the best indicator of activity, the best indicator of
20 conduct is past conduct, and In closing,

Your Honor,

I would

May I ask you one question before you

Yes, Your Honor.
So that we don't really know, do we,

whether, although this man might have formally been entitled

12 to bail,

say, $10 million or something, we really don't know

13 apart from

this stipulation whether this man would have been

14 released, do we?
15

MR. SCHAAF;

QUESTION;

No, Your Honor.

Yes.
That is theoretically possible, yes.

10

But in closing, Your Honor, last year in your State

11

of the Judiciary comment, you mentioned that states which --

12 states and governments exist merely to protect people, and

13 while it may be admirable to attempt to do whatever we can
14 to protect the rights of accused, states fail in their
15 mission if they don't also protect the people of their
16 states from the fear of crime and from crime itself.
17

We suggest in closing that Nebraska has done what

18 it can.

QUESTION;

Your friend has quoted the same material

the case in the
