ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. HOGE, III, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HODGES:

7

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The single issue presented is the

9
10

constitutionality of the Kentucky conspicuous posting of

11

notice in landlord and tenants cases.

12

statement of the problem addressed is whether or not

13

alternative constructive posting service continues to be

14

satisfactory notice under the due process clause, unless

15

shored up with additional mailing.

An alternative

The facts of this case should be addressed in

16
17

two parts.

18

tenant or forcible eviction procedure in Kentucky; and

19

number two, as concerns the specific plaintiffs in this

20

case.

21

Number one, what in fact is the landlord and

I would point out that I believe the facts of

22

the case speak very strongly about notice in the

23

legislative scheme that is set up.

24

must notify the tenant in writing that the tenant is in

25

breach of the lease for failure to make his rent

payments.

2

mail.

3

That writing is by registered or certified

The tenant is on notice.
The second fact of the legislative scheme is

4

that the written notice is defined under the statutes

5

quite clearly, and only after that notice is sent as a

6

condition precedent to the bringing of a Writ of

7

Forcible Entry are you allowed to seek such an

8

instrument, and in fact, the forcible writ cannot be

9

sought until seven days after this notice is sent.

10

You then file in our lower court for a

11

forcible writ.

This writ is subsequently served under

12

the statute, which is the issue of this case, 454.030.

13

It is served one of three ways.

14

serving the tenant, if you can find the tenant.

15

Secondly, by leaving a copy of it with a 16-year old or

16

better who would understand the action.

17

thirdly by mailing, as we call it, only thirdly by

18

posting the Writ of Eviction.

19

Next,

QU ESTION:

It's served by actually

And only

Mr. Hoge, I see the statute says --

21

as to what you describe as the second method of service

22

— that the process server may explain and leave a copy

23

of the notice.

24

phrase "may explain"?

25

Have the Kentucky courts construed the

MR. HOGEj

What does that mean?
No,

3

understanding.

Nor, in fact, is this — has that

5

-- and, of course, that would be the only issue that

6

would concern this Court today — then another period of

7

time, seven days, at least three days, must expire.

8

However, the record speaks clearly in this matter that

9

there is at least two weeks or so after that finding

10

before another writ, the Writ of Possession, is issued,

11

and then another period of three days goes by prior to

12

any literal set-out.

13

Now, I think the facts of this complaint tell

14

the Court a great deal about the truth of service by

15

posting in this case.

2

there was some mistake about the matter; they had

3

withheld their rent.

4

Not only had they not paid the rent once and

Next, all three plaintiffs alleged — and

5

that’s the extent of the proof in the matter, by the

6

way, — that they did not receive the Writ of the

7

forcible detainer.

8

But the most important fact, I believe, in the

9

entire case is that all three plaintiffs got the Writ of

10

Possession, the second writ, by precisely the same

11

means, by the posting statute, by the exact same service

12

method, and all three admit that in their complaint.

13

QUESTION;

Wasn’t there something about it

MB. HOGE:

Yes, sir. Your Honor.

In the

16

complaint it states that it was found inside on the

17

floor, and that it had apparently been stuck through the

18

mail slot in the door.

19

their apartment on the floor, and apparently put through

20

the mail slot.

All three allege it was found in

21

There is a case in Kentucky on that —

22

QUESTION:

Then it isn’t precisely the same.

23

MB. HOGE;

Well, yes, sir.

Possibly not.

It

24

is not the same in that we have no idea whether or not

25

they got the original writ forcible.

We only have an

1

idea of whether or not they did get the second one —

2

other than their allegation that they did not receive it.
Now, whether or not this statute is

3
4

unconstitutional in the way the sheriffs practice the

posting of the notice is an entirely different issue,

person that might have been in this class, but we don't

It's right under the forcible

Mr. Hoge, I take it there was

evidence which was not contradicted at the trial or in

22

the court to the effect that the posted notices are

lost or not delivered?

question in that it directs itself to the evidence that

That's the total extent of the

When you say evidence, Mr. Hoge,

the thing went off on a motion for summary judgment,

9

didn't it?

10

MR. HOGEi

Yes, sir.

11

QUESTION:

So was it evidence in the sense of

12

what, depositions, or — ?
MR. HOGEi

13

Yes, sir, one deposition taken in

14

my office where the six deputy sheriffs, all of whom are

15

politically appointed, gave their best opinion on what

16

transpired and what they thought happened in forcible

17

cases.

18

whether or not it was a forcible or a Writ of

19

Possession, whether or not they were setting a person

20

out or whether they were serving the original eviction

notice.

23

setouts, writs for possession.

24

they were most upset.

Most of the time, they were confused about

Now, I won't mislead the Court.

There is

summary judgment in that the Sixth Circuit case was, on

8

all fours beyond a question, the Weber case was right on

point.

The district court judge addressed the Weber

decision, found it to be constitutional, stated that it

11

was unfortunate that the additional mailing —

Well, he was bound by it, wasn't he?

13

MR. HOGE:

Pardon me?

14

QUESTION:

He was bound by it, wasn't he?

15

MR. HOGE:

Yes, sir.

And as a matter of fact,

16

he comments on that.

And he comments on that but he

17

says it's a salutory rule that he was bound by, and

18

points outr that the Weber decision had been the law for

19

some 70 years.

20

clear that he felt it was unfortunate that mailing could

21

not be mandated by a federal court as an additional due

22

process safeguard in this particular case, but could not

23

be mandated by a federal court since due process does

24

not require a state to adopt the optimum method of

25

service, but only a minimum standard to be satisfied.

That is precisely what

the issue is here today.

metropolitan areas at this time.

I maintain that the Kentucky

Well, what did the court of appeals

hold?

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. HOGEs

The court of appeals held that the

2

lower court was reversed.

They held that they were

3

compelled by the Mullane decision of this Court.

4

QUESTION;

Yes.

5

MR. HOGE;

To find this statute

6
7

To require what?

unconstitutional, as it would be so easy to add mailing.
QUESTION;

But you think it would violate the

8

court of appeals ruling if the plaintiff just mailed

9

rather than posted?

10

MR. HOGE;

Absolutely.

12

QUESTION;

And so do you think the net result

13

is that he'd have to do both?

14

MR. HOGE;

I’ve been advised by

11

Yes, sir, number one.

And number

15

two, I’ve been advised that it's the state of the law

16

today, the plaintiffs believe, that only personal

17

service will be satisfactory as this statute has been

18

ruled unconstitutional by the Sixth Circuit, and

19

therefore, there is no procedure in landlord and tenants

20

cases other than to — in my experience — hire bounty

21

hunters to watch for the tenant and a special bailiff

22

and finally get him personally served.

23

So that is one of the crying reasons that we

24

have to be here, number one.

Number two, I would point

25

out that all of the sophisticated legislation of the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

landlord and tenants law was passed in 1974.

Our

2

legislature meets every two years.

3

we've had four legislatures.

4

they have chosen not to amend or alter the forcible due

5

process posting service method.

Since that time

In each of those instances

Now, the amicus point out that there are 17

6
7

states that have this type of statute.

We believe that

8

this statute in and of itself, as the legislature has

9

found, and in fact written a law, is constitutionally

10

sufficient.

There*s no question that it would be much

11

more comfortable for me here this afternoon if I could

12

say that this statute also has mailing.

13

possibly the Sixth Circuit would have had no problem

14

with it had it said mailing, but it doesn't say mailing,

15

number one.

In fact, maybe

Number two, the mailing issue in and of itself

16
17

was somewhat unclear to me in the Sixth Circuit's

18

decision as they cite the New York case, which is the

19

one of three or four cases where this has been

20

legitimately addressed.

21

New York statute provides for a mailing as well.

22

-- the lower court, district court, also cited that case.
QUESTION;

23

And in the New York case, the
Judge

Mr. Hoge, what is the position of

24

the Kentucky Attorney General about the issue in this

25

case?

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. HOGE;

Well, the Kentucky Attorney General

2

asked me to represent the state in this matter and I

3

have gone forward this them, and, of course, they allege

4

that it’s constitutional.

5

6
7

QUESTION;

But there's no formal appearance by

the AG here.
MR. HOGE;

No, sir.

This is — points up an

8

excellent problem, though.

The Louisville-Jefferson

9

County area is the one of three municipal areas.

The

10

Kentucky legislature is very, very rural, and in fact,

11

the ultra landlord and tenants laws are currently under

12

tremendous attack in all of our courts and have been for

13

sometime and hopefully will be resolved in the near

14

future in the our court of appeals at this time as being

15

unconstitutional special legislation, placing much

16

higher restrictions and requirements on urban landlords

17

than are placed on them in the balance of the state.

18

If this Court were to sustain the Sixth

19

Circuit's decision that it would be, in my paraphrasing,

20

much better to mail, I would have no system by which to

21

have a statute passed to allow for that.

22

QUESTION;

Well, this Court has no power

23

anymore than the Sixth Circuit did, to say that mailing

24

will be enough.

25

is not required under the Constitution.

All it could say is that mailing is or
If Kentucky

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

wants to say that -- you may insist on mailing, but

2

we're going to insist on posting, then you’d have to do

3

both .
MR. HOGE:

4

Justice Rehnguist states the case

5

precisely.

6

about whether or not posting continues to be due

7

process.

8
9

That is what we are here about.

We are here

That is exactly what we are here about.
QUESTION:

Don't you suppose the Court, like

the Sixth Circuit, could reach different conclusions

10

about the validity of the statute as applied in

11

different states or in different areas of the same state?

12

MR. HOGE:

I believe so, but I believe it will

13

be difficult for anyone to distinguish how this — how

14

mailing can be added to this statute.

15

be determined to be so much better that therefore, this

16

statute is -- lacks due process, without saying at the

17

same time that posting in and of itself is no longer

18

sufficient.

19

20

QUESTION:

How mailing can

Well, the court of appeals has said

posting isn't sufficient in this case.

21

MR. HOGE:

Yes, sir, and then --

22

QUESTION:

And the statute, to the extent that

23
24
25

it requires only posting, is unconstitutional.
MR. HOGE:

Yes, sir, and that's precisely why

it's wrong.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION*

1

Well, — what if you looked at the

2

court of appeals opinion as representing its judgment

3

about how posting operates in the particular environment

4

that is involved in this case?

5

HR. HOGEi

I would say first of all --

6

QUESTION*

And it might come to a wholly

7

different conclusion somewhere else.
MR. HOGE:

8
9

I would say first of all that it

would be improper if the court of appeals were

10

determining the evidence that was presented that the

11

district court judge had already decided the summary

12

judgment matter on, because there was very little

13

evidence and, in fact, the Sixth Circuit did not do

14

that.

15

York case as allowing for mailing, and as mailing was

16

appreciably sure to get there, that that would be the

17

way we should do it in Kentucky.

They merely said that they recognized the New

But that, in fact, is — and it is also the

18
19

basis of the method which the court in the Sixth Circuit

20

reasoned to this decision that makes the — our office

21

feel very much that it wasn't necessary.

22

expedient, it just seemed so much better.

23

stand here and say well, look, you're bound to get the

24

mail.

25

you're bound to get the mail.

That's not always true.

It just seemed
It's easy to

In my experience, yes,
But look how much easier

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it is to mail it, and. therefore, the old system is

2

improper.
But in fact, the way they got to that decision

3
4

was to go back to the International Shoe, to the

5

Pennoyer versus Neff matters which were built on

6

fictions of in personam jurisdiction, on that kind of

7

jurisdictional problem, and they gave very little

8

attention to what we believe and what I think, in fact,

9

are the exact questions presented here today — the

10

Mullane versus Hanover Trust.
That's what we're here about.

11

♦

We're not here

12

about jurisdiction, we're not here about what might be a

13

better process.

14

Mullane versus Central Hanover Trust.

We're here about whether this satisfies

And quite simply, it is our position that

15
16

posting in this matter gave notice when the tenant

17

didn't pay the rent, they knew about it.

18

Hanover, the test in all of the due process cases is

19

whether from the totality of the circumstances, the

20

person was reasonably calculated to have notice.

The test in

He knows that.

Well, suppose the tenant claims the

MR. HOGE:

Not to my knowledge. Your Honor.

11

Counsel will address this argument that in

fact, this is no longer in rem, this is no longer solely

13

a question of possession, though the Kentucky case that

14

is currently the law of the matter states that that is

all that the forcible eviction matter is because the

It's our position that the tenant also has an

ORAL ARGUHENT OF ROBERT FREDERICK SMITH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

7

MR. SMITH:

8

9

Hr. Smith?

Mr. Chief Justice, my it please

the Court:

10

Before I get to my prepared remarks I would

11

like to address, if I may, some of the questions that

12

the Court has previously asked.

13

of advantage from Mr. Hoge in that I’ve had an

14

opportunity to practice tenant-landlord law for quite

15

sometime with our office.

16

to have an incorrect impression of what the law may be.

17

I am perhaps at a bit

And I don't want this Court

Mr. Hoge was correct when he says that

18

sometimes, a landlord may send a letter requesting the

19

rental payment, but I can tell you from my experience,

20

most landlords do not send a letter.

21

of the law under which the letter is sent is under the

22

Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.

23

And the provision

Mr. Hoge is correct in pointing out to this

24

Court that that Act currently applies to only three of

25

Kentucky’s 100 — excuse me, two of Kentucky’s 118

1

counties, and one additional city.

In all other

2

counties in Kentucky, the landlord is not required to

3

send a letter prior to a writ being initiated.

4

And I would also say that even if the landlord

5

were required to send a letter, and even if the landlord

6

does send a letter, it is interesting to note that under

7

Kentucky law, that letter must be hand-delivered or sent

8

by Registered Mail.

9

letter, there is no court date on it, there's no reason

And even if the tenant gets that

10

to believe that that letter in and of itself calls the

11

person to court, because it does not.
QUESTION:

12
13

Well, it gives the tenant some idea

that the landlord is about to do something, doesn't it?
MR. SMITH:

14

In the limited area in which it is

15

used, it may raise the possibility that a landlord may

16

go to court.

17

there are numerous, close to 90% of the cases that I

18

have been involved in, the landlord has not sent the

19

letter.

20

But like I said, my experience has been

QUESTION;

Is that because the landlord was in

21

some jurisdiction that didn't — some part of Kentucky

22

that didn't require the sending of a letter?

23

MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

In the area in which I

24

practice, the Uniform Act is in effect, and in each case

25

that I am participating in, the landlord should have

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sent the letter.

And in, like I said, in the numbers of

2

cases that I have mentioned to you, they do not do so.
QUESTION:

3

So then, so far as construing the

4

statute on its face is concerned, we should construe it

5

in connection with the requirement of the Uniform Act?
HR. SMITH:

6

Justice Rehnquist, I think that

7

that's a very interesting question.

I think that this

8

Court must look at the peculiarity of the current

9

application of the Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant

10

Act.

11

posting, posting is unconstitutional because it is not

12

reasonably calculated to appraise the tenant of pending

13

litigation.

14

But it is our position that with regard to

Now, Mr.

Hoge has mentioned that there is

15

another writ that is sent out by the Kentucky courts.

16

That is true, but that writ is sent out only after a

17

judgment has been entered.

18

and in some of the cases, again, that I have been

19

involved with, that writ is not received by the tenant

20

until after the judgment is there, and after the time to

21

appeal has lapsed.

22

And in this particular case,

There is Kentucky law which indicates that if

23

you do not appeal an unfavorable decision in the

24

Kentucky district court, the tenant-landlord court,

25

circuit court which is the next highest court has no

QUESTION;

2

The only question here is whether

3

for an eviction, the posting is sufficient under the

4

Constitution, and that is the only question before the

5

Court, isn't it?

6

ME. SMITH;

Yes, sir, that's correct.

7

I might also add that Mr. Hoge indicated that

8

the tenants had not paid their rent in this particular

9

case.

Long, long ago and far, far away that may have

10

been true.

But in fact, what occurred was the people

11

offered their rent and the rent was refused by the

12

public housing authorities.

13

record, we initiated litigation involving the public

14

housing authorities, and that particular issue, the

15

payment of rent, was settled favorably to the tenants.

And if you will note in our

the Court was interested and was willing to answer the

2

questions.

3

glad to go with them.

But I've got some other remarks and I'll be

We in Kentucky with a minority of other states

5

have a method of service of process which has come from

a time that has long since passed.

7

process risks our state court and those like it in

8

becoming a landlord's rubber stamp, despite your

9

warnings and ruling in Pernell versus Southall Realty.

This same method of

10

Posting simply does not withstand constitutional

11

scrutiny at this time because it is not reasonably

12

calculated, nor reasonably certain to appraise the

13

tenant of the pending litigation.
Before I get into the constitutional

14
15

ramifications before this Court, however, I would like

16

to take just one moment to discuss the importance of an

17

eviction action in state courts.
Possession is no longer the sole issue before

18
19

a court in an eviction matter.

Tenants — excuse me.

Landlords, in addition to possession, are now requesting

21

back payment of rent, which is permitted under Kentucky

statute.

Do you agree with Mr. Hoge that

Kentucky law would require personal service if the

MR. SMITH:

No, ma'am, I disagree with Mr.

We believe that the record before this Court
shows that the sliver of scotch tape and the thumbtack
have indeed replaced the hard rap upon the door.

It is

significant to note that the process servers, those
whose deposition we have taken, indicate that they know
that tenants don’t always receive their writs, they know
they get torn away.

They also know that there are times

when the property itself is not amenable to posting and
they have to fold them and stick them in a doorjam,
which is even a less unreliable manner of notice.
So appellant's brief also concedes the point
that there are times when tenants do not receive notice,
and we think that that’s very important.

And again, as

I mentioned, common sense will tell you that a piece of
paper exposed to the ravages of the elements and to
vandals does not fare well at all.

mail for posting.

I think under either set of

circumstances it would be constitutional.

22

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir,

I believe that’s

23

correct.

And I think the record shows, however, that

24

posting which is an unreliable form of notice, is that

25

that’s used most often by the sheriffs.

And one part of

the proof in this case indicated that the stamp that was
pre-printed for the returns on the back of these writs
indicated that posting was the first method of process.
In fact/ one of the sheriffs, whose deposition
we took, was not even aware that there was any statutory
requirement for personal or substituted service -QUESTION;

Do you think the statute requires

posting if they can't — well. I'll put it this way.

If

you can't personally serve and if you can’t find a
member of the family, would it satisfy the Kentucky law
if you mailed it?
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

So you wouldn't have to do both?

MR. SMITH;
would.

Yes, sir, I think it would.

No, sir, I don't believe you

Kentucky just changed their civil rules to allow

service in other types of civil cases by certified mail,
in addition to the sheriff handing a summons to you.
QUESTION;
on Kentucky law?

Well, are you sure of your answer

I gathered your opponent took a

somewhat different position.

I mean, if Kentucky says

by statute that this is the way you serve an unlawful
detainer action, do you think that one can simply
substitute a form of service that isn't prescribed in
the statute for one that is?
MR. SMITH;

No, sir, my — I’m sorry if I

My remarks were meant to say mailing as a

may be.
MR. SMITH*

No, the current law would not be

13

satisfied by mail because it's an element of service

14

that's not contemplated by the current statute.

15

Frankly, my answer was premised upon the fact that we

16

would prevail in this case, the Court would find posting

17

unconstitutional, and then what is Kentucky to do.

18

what Kentucky should do is either supplement posting

If the statute required that the

service be made by slipping it under the door, would you

be here?

NR. SMITH;

If, in fact, it were slipped under

got this second writ in this particular case.

QUESTION;

That's why I'm asking.

18

MR. SMITH;

If it were shown that it were

pending proceeding, we would not be here.

21

don't know what the stats would show on that, I'm sorry.

22

I really

In our argument this afternoon and in our

23

briefs, we believe that tenants have shown that posting

24

fails to meet the minimal standards of the Fourteenth

25

Amendment, and most importantly, fails to meet the test

great majority of instances, no doubt justice will be
done.
MR. SMITH*

We believe the chance is much too

great with regard to this particular scenario.

And we

also don't want to be bound by specific numbers.

We

just believe that what we have shown you today is that
posting is not reasonably calculated.

I mean, due

process isn't a mathematical computation, and it's bad
for you or I to discuss mathematical computations with
regard to due process.
But we believe that this record shows you that
posting is not reasonably calculated.
In balancing the harm to tenants with the cost
of constitutional notice, it is clear that the scales
weigh in the tenant's favor.

Cost in time and in money

should mailing be required would be de minimus.

The

names and addresses of the'tenants are easily
ascertainable.

Reliance upon such a system as posting,

which falls below the de minimal requirements of the
Fourteenth Amendment and the test established in
Mullane, show you a system which is unconstitutional and
must be struck.
Thank you.
