ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. BACAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BACAS*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the

10

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has standing as parens

11

patriae to sue 32 individual apple growers from the

12

Commonwealth of Virginia for allegedly breaching the

13

employment contracts and allegedly violating the federal

14

statutory and regulatory rights of a small number of

15

Puerto Rican workers during the 1978 apple harvest.

16

I am going to get into these points in more

17

detail later, but we think there are three major reasons

18

why the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico lacks parens patriae

19

standing in this case.

21

statute, Puerto Rico has put a special burden on the

of Puerto Ricans participating in this program, has it

not ?

SR. BACAS*

QUESTION*

6

And that is a rather broad

responsibility, isn’t it?

7

MR. BACAS*

8

QUESTION*

9

They do under Public Law 87.

I would say it is. Your Honor.
So, do you think that the

Commonwealth — I guess it is commonwealth law, not

10

state, isn't it? -- that commonwealth law has any role

11

to play in deciding a parens patriae issue?

12

MR. BACAS *

13

QUESTION*

14

MR. BACAS;

15

Absolutely none. Your Honor.
None.

Why not?

The concept of standing is a

federal constitutional concept --

16

QUESTION*

Is parens patriae —

17

MR. BACAS:

— even parens patriae standing.

18

Well, they -- in fact, they rely on it in a very limited

19

sense.

20

Puerto Rico is the proper party to bring this parens

21

patriae action as a result of Public Law 87 if parens

22

patriae action is permitted to be brough-t, so that law

23

is —

Well, are you suggesting that

parens patriae is a jurisdictional Article III problem?

MR . BACAS:

2

QUESTION;

Where do you get that?

3

SR. BACAS:

Where do I get that?

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

Article III

4

limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and

5

controversies, and the courts have generally, as I will

6

discuss in greater detail in my argument --

7

QUESTION:

Well, the cases and controversies,

8

but it is between -- controversies between the person

9

bringing the suit and the defendant.

10

SR. BACAS:

11

QUESTION;

12

Yes.
And didn't we have something to say

about that in the case five or six years ago?

13

MR. BACAS;

14

QUESTION;

Which case is that, Your Honor?
The name eludes me at the moment,

15

but it is discussed in some of the briefs.

16

remember about it is, it was written by Mr. Justice

17

Marshal .
MR. BACAS:

18
19

Honor?

All I can

Are you talking about Hawaii, Your

Are you talking about Hawaii v. Standard Oil?

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

21

MR. BACAS:

That's the one.

The Hawaii v. Standard Oil, there

22

was extensive discussion of parens patriae standing in

23

that case, which was, incidentally, brought in the

24

district court.

Court.

It was not an original action in this

1

me, but I believe he made the reference that parens

2

patriae -- the case did not ultimately turn on the

3

question of parens patriae standing, but there was an

4

extensive discussion --

5

QUESTION:

It was on antitrust, wasn’t it?

6

Wasn’t it on antitrust, and parens patriae was just a

7

little narrow slice of it?

8
9

ME. BACAS:

Yes.

It did, but the ultimate

issue in Hawaii really turned on the question of damages

10

under the antitrust laws, and whether a state was

11

entitled to bring, in effect, a treble damage claim

12

under the antitrust law, and the Court held it did not.

13

QUESTION:

Well, what concerns me, and the

14

reason I asked you the question, if a state, and let’s

15

for this purpose treat Puerto Rico as a state, and it’s

16

a sovereign state, and adopts a rather, as it has here,

17

a system for implementing the federal statute, why can’t

18

we defer to the state's view of its policy and

19

sovereignty interest instead of substituting our own?

20

Are you going to suggest we can't because there is an

21

Article III limitation?

22

MR. BACAS:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, sir.
Where do you get that?

I still

don't understand that.
ME. EACAS:

Article III limits the

1

jurisdiction of courts to cases and controversies, and

2

we don't believe that there is a case and controversy

3

between the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and these

4

individual growers.

5

controversy between the individual Puerto Rican workers

6

who allegedly were — applied for these jobs and

7

allegedly were discriminated against, or were denied

8

employment.

9

There might be a case and

QUESTION:

In other words, are you saying that

10

an individual Puerto Rican who got drawn into this and

11

came up here and sat idle and didn’t get a job or some

12

other comparable complaint could sue that particular

13

apple grower?

14

KR. BACAS:

Certainly.

There is no question

15

about that, Your Honor.

16

jurisdiction of the courts to hear a claim of a

17

particular worker, whether it be Puerto Rican or from

18

some other state, to sue a particular grower.

19

QUESTION:

We have never contested the

Of course, we have had original

20

cases in which we have thought that we ought not allow a

21

state suing another state to invoke our original

22

jurisdiction if all it is doing is fronting for some

23

private interest in the state, but that is a matter of

24

protecting our original jurisdiction, but I still wonder

25

why in the district courts a state isn't, in the context

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of this kind of case, with this kind of implementation,

2

why a sovereign state ought not be welcome in a federal

3

district court to represent the citizens —

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I —
-- to protect their federal rights

as the federal government has set them up.
MR. BACAS:

Why not?

Your Honor, you are right that

8

most of the cases, especially the cases in this Court,

9

have involved the question of the original jurisdiction

10

of this Court, ani I think the Court has, justifiably

11

so, been very protective of that, to limit cases which

12

truly merit the --

13

QUESTION:

I know, but those reasons are --

14

those considerations don’t apply to a suit in the

15

federal district court.

16

MR. BACAS:

They don’t, Your Honor, but this

17

Court has never so limited the — in stating the test

18

for parens patriae standing, this Court has never so

19

discriminated between those cases of parens patriae

20

brought as original cases in this Court and those cases

21

brought in the district court.

22

Marshal's discussion in Hawaii v. Standard Oil, that was

23

not an original — case of original jurisdiction.

2

MR. BACAS*

3

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.
Well, then, why can't we allow

4

states, sovereign states to bring proceedings on behalf

5

of their citizens in district court?

6

SR. BACAS*

There are a couple of reasons.

7

Your Honor.

8

speak for all of its workers.

9

of those workers actually even have complaints.

One is, the state is presuming here to
We don't know whether all
That is

10

one reason why we limit cases generally to those people

11

who are actually aggrieved.

12

QUESTION*

Well, apparently the Puerto Rican

13

legislature thought there were a number of Puerto Rican

14

citizens who had interests under this federal setup to

15

be protected and imposed the burden on the Commissioner

16

of Labor —

17

MR. BACAS:

18

QUESTION*

19
20

Yes, sir.
-- to take the necessary steps to

protect them.
MR. BACAS*

The legislature of Puerto Rico did

21

enact Public Law 87, and that Public Law 87 has been in

22

effect overruled by the First Circuit in the case of

But I thought this lawsuit by

Puerto Rico was for the purpose of enforcing these

7

rights of Puerto Rican citizens consistently with the

8

regulations and federal rules of the Department of

10

MR. BACAS:

The suit does purport to do that,

Your Honor.

and there is even a right of appeal.

appeal that to the regional administrator, where the

hearing.
QUESTION;

5

6

Well, why can’t all that operate

and yet allow Puerto Rico to maintain this suit?
MR. BACAS;

7

In effect, you would be having a

8

complete duplication of litigation.

The mere fact that

9

the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is bringing this lawsuit

10

has certainly not stopped the workers from bringing

11

their own lawsuits or even filing their own complaints

12

with the employment service system.

everybody on the same issue —

11

not the worker.

12

13
14

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but they are suing on

behalf of citizens nevertheless.
MR. BACASs

Yes.

I would say that it is in

should have said to their workers, look, there is a

So it seems to me that if

10

you are going to grant parens patriae standing to the

11

Commonwealth, which I don't think you should, I am not

12

sure how you distinguish the commonwealth situation from

13

the State of Texas or the State of Florida.

14

As a matter of fact, there have been a couple

15

of amicus curiae briefs filed by the State of New York

16

and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, so there is

17

obviously — there are some states out there who are

18

anxious to pursue their rights and bring lawsuits if the

19

Court so permits.

20

22

The complaint in this case sets forth three
different categories of alleged violations.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was going to explore the history of parens patriae, the

2

case really did not turn on the concept of parens

patriae.

4

discussion that there was reference to the answer from

5

Justice Brennan earlier that there has never been this

6

distinction certainly in this Court and most certainly

7

in the lower courts, the courts of appeals, that these

whether we are talking about a case arising under the

I think Hawaii is important because of its

10

original jurisdiction of this Court or one that is

11

brought in the district court, and it applies whether we

12

are talking about damages or it applies whether we are

13

talking about injunctive relief.
I wouli note that in Pennsylvania v. New

14
15

Jersey, the State of -- the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

16

was seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

weren't really seeking damages in that case, and yet

What was the reason?

The fact

6

that they were in effect pursuing the individual claims

7

of their citizens which those citizens could pursue

8

themselves.
QUESTION;

9

So is that just an application of

10

an ancient rule that the real party in interest should

11

sue, or was it an Article III decision like you

12

suggested earlier?

13

SB. BACAS;

14

QUESTION;

I would say it is both.
Then you do have a fail-back

position.

The fail-back position is that even if the

16

case or controversy limitation doesn't bar you, bar this

17

action, that even more ancient principles, namely, that

18

the party in interest, that Puerto Rico has no real

19

interest in this case.

20

SR. BACAS;

21

QUESTION;

I would say that. Your Honor.
Hr. Bacas, in analyzing this,

22

should we consider some of the same factors that the

Court considered in determining standing for a private

24

organization such as in Havens Realty Corp. opinion

25

decided this term?

In applying those, then, how is

Puerto Rico different from the Organization Home which

was found to have standing in Havens Realty?

7

MR. BACAS:

When an association is suing on

9

at least the association must allege that the actions

affect the members, and therefore that the members are

11

synonymous with the association.

12

can make this assumption in the case of a state.

cannot identify the state or the Commonwealth of Puerto

for camping, that that is enough to give the association

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. LENZINI, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LENZINI:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, members of

the Court, this litigation is only one chapter in an

13

attempt by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to place

14

unemployed farm workers in jobs in the east coast apple

certain apple growers to discourage referral of Puerto

The line is hard to draw. Your

three years of attempts by the Commonwealth of Puerto

government effort to place workers in the east coast

MR. LENZINI:

The harm must be serious.

It is

20

very hard to draw the line. Your Honor.

The harm must

21

be serious, and this is serious harm particularly

22

because it is addressed a-t a group boycott in effect.

23

In Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, the gravamen of

24

that complaint was that the 20 railroads had conspired

25

to prefer other ports to Georgia ports, and therefore it

QUESTIONS

Sell, then, why would you say -- if

3

there were just two involved, just two workers, you

4

really should come out with the same result, that it is

5

really a discrimination against Puerto Picans.

6

MR. LENZINI:

I think. Your Honor, that in

7

parens patriae actions, while it has not been really

8

articulated, there has been a reluctance to permit the

9

sovereign to unleash his majesty upon private litigants,

10

and therefore as in In Re Debs, before the government is

11

going to be permitted to come in against private

12

parties, there must be a public wrong, and that the

13

sovereign may not vindicate the rights of individuals, a

14

small number of individuals.

QUESTION:

Is that an Article III standing —

MR. LENZINI:

No, I don't think it's Article

SR. LENZINI;

Is that the Second Circuit case?
That's the Second Circuit case,

MR. LENZINIs

The amicus brief was filed in

9

the Second Circuit at the request of the panel.

10

after the argument was held, they requested the

11

Solicitor General to file an expression — the interest

12

of the United States.

13

turned out, filed a brief for the Secretary, because his

14

was the primary responsibility for carrying out the

15

statute, and in that brief, the question had been raised

16

as to whether or not the Employment System — the

17

Employment Service complaint system, which is this

18

administrative relief provision available to the

19

workers, whether or not that was an adequate remedy for

20

these workers, and the answer given there was no, it is

21

not, it does not address the type of widespread,

22

industry-wide, systematic discrimination which was the

23

subject of this case.

Let me try another hypothetical to

20

see if I can understand.

Suppose an action is brought

21

by the State of Georgia against all the hotel and

restaurant owners in New York City, where probably there

23

is the largest concentration of that group in the

24

country.

25

minority unemployment in the State of Georgia is 25,000

2

and restaurants, and that those jobs are now held

3

two-thirds by Puerto Ricans, and that there is a plan

4

and scheme to hire Puerto Ricans for these positions in

5

New York, and that therefore the unemployed of Georgia

6

are being denied something.

7
8

Now, laying aside all the merits, does Georgia
have parens patriae standing to bring that suit?

9

NR. LENZINI;

There is no federal right, Nr.

10

Chief Justice.

In this case, we have a strong

11

Congressional preference articulated in the Immigration

12

and

13

by the Federal Employment Service System whenever

MR- LENZINI:

There is a right not to be

1

with Oklahoma versus Santa Fe Railroad?
MR. LENZINIs

2

Yes, I think so, because I think

3

in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, the question

4

was one of discrimination of a particular sector of the

5

country.

6

by railroads who were preferring the ports of other

7

nearby states, and I think that was not a concept.

8

the discriminatory element in Georgia versus

9

Pennsylvania Railroad that distinguishes it, I think,

10

from the Atchison case, and that's what we have here,

11

because we have here an attempt by the growers to

12

prevent the Puerto Ricans from being a threat to their

13

use of alien labor.

14

QUESTION;

Georgia was being put in an inferior position

It's

Well, do you think that threat --

15

do you think the action of the growers was directed

16

against Puerto Ricans in a different sense than it would

17

have been directed against people from Maryland or

18

people from Michigan, or were they just anxious to use

19

alien labor and exclude whatever citizens they might

20

want to, or might have to?

21

MR. LENZINIs

I think that's right.

We have

22

23 percent rural unemployment, which means we have a

23

body of workers who are unemployed, rural laborers, and

24

who are available as a pool to supply, to be a labor

25

supply for agricultural pursuits.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Well, supposing Michigan had

2

exactly that same situation, 23 percent unemployed.

3

Would they have any lesser a claim than Puerto Eico did?

4

MR. LENZINI;

5

QUESTION;

No, I think not.

I think not.

So there is nothing peculiar about

6

the Puerto Rican labor force or the status of Puerto

7

Ricans that gives you any special standing.

8
9
10
11

MR. LENZINI;

I think that's correct.

I think

there's nothing special about Puerto Rico in this
respect.
Public Law 87 was enacted by the Commonwealth

12

legislature in 1962, and it set forth special

13

obligations on the part of workers who would hire for

14

off-Island use Puerto Rican laborers.

15

mid-seventies, 1975, 1976, the U.S. Department of Labor

16

held that if the Puerto Ricans were to insist upon these

17

extra conditions that were not available, not required

18

under the Federal Employment Service System, then they

19

would be held legally unavailable in terms of the

20

Immigration and Nationality Act.

21

though they were in fact available to work in these

22

orchards, they would not be held to be legally available

23

because they were asking for more burdensome conditions.

24
25

In the

That is to say, even

When this Court denied certiorari in the
Flecha, Flecha versus Quiros, the Commonwealth

2

Law 87, designed to help the workers, is being used to

3

bar the workers, and so, they said, if jobs come through

4

the Federal Employment Service System, the Secretary of

5

Labor is permitted, given the discretion to exempt these

6

workers — these growers, pardon me, from the additional

7

conditions of Public Law 87.
In due course, then 2,000 Puerto Rican workers

8

9

were recruited to work in the 1970 apple harvest, but

10

immediately four associations of apple growers went into

11

court in the Western District of Virginia.

Thereafter, there were too many workers in the

Mr. Bacas, opposing counsel, says that the

MR. BACASi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

would like to emphasize that both the district court and

Both courts said, you look at the size of the segment of

the harm, and you look at the ability of those injured

14

to rectify the alleged wrongs on their own.

17

that test applied to these particular facts.
