ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEWTON N. MINOW, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. MINOW»

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10 the Court»
11

This is a case where the FTC has been obsessed

12 with the past, unconcerned with the present, and blind to
13 the future.
14

This Court decided the important Goldfarb case in

15 June of 1975.

The American Medical Association immediately

16 recognized the profound implications of Goldfarb for the
17 medical profession and promptly undertook a major revision
18 of its ethical standards and policies in light of Goldfarb.
19 Without any investigation of any kind to learn the AMA's
20 position, the FTC filed this complaint in the dark.

We

21 first heard of it when the FTC had a press conference in
22 Washington and a reporter called the AMA's office in Chicago
23 to inquire about the AMA's position.
24

Once it had been filed, the FTC gave its attention

25 only to the past.

Five years later Judge Mansfield observed
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Commission "was still pressing for its pound of flesh."

2 He said the FTC's action "has been unjustified,

unnecessary,

3 a waste of administrative and judicial resources, and in my
4 view the FTC,” he said, "is engaged in the futile business
5 of beating a dead horse."
6

Why?

7

Ethical principles in the medical profession are

8 nothing new.

How did such a thing happen?

They go back thousands of years before the

9 time of Hippocrates.

In 1975 when this case began most

10 states throughout the United States had laws that prohibited

11

professional advertising.

In the light of Goldfarb,

12 however, we recognized there was a need for change.

So in

13 the spring of 1976 the AMA published a new statement on
14 advertising and solicitation.
15

QUESTION*

Well, does Goldfarb deal with

16 advertising or solicitation?
17

MR. KINOW*

No, Mr. Chief Justice, but it did deal

18 with the fact that the learned professions were subject —

21 laws.

Were not exempt.
Were not exempt from the antitrust

And we knew, I must say as well, we knew Bates was

22 pending in the lower courts on its way up here, so we were

23 aware of the change, the fundamental change that was
24 evolving in the law with its relationship to professions and
25 with its relationship to the First Amendment in

1 advertising.

We could see the winds of change were coining

2 fast.
3

So what we stated in the spring of

'76 was thiss

4 the public is entitled to know and the physician is entitled
5 to advertise useful information provided — including
6 information about fees — provided only that the information
7 was not false or misleading or deceptive.

And we suggested

8 and defined four practices that we believe have a
9 significant capacity to mislead patients.
10

Now, that was 14 months before Bates was decided.

11 Consumer groups, including the Ralph Nader organization,
12 immediately congratulated the AMA as being the first
13 profession to move with the evolving law.
14 Washington.

We went to

We told the FTC what had happened, what we had

15 already done about advertising.

To no avail.

We told the

16 FTC of our new positions on contract practice, practices to
17 which the FTC has not objected to this day.

We got nowhere

18 with the staff so we filed a formal motion with the
19 Commission and said to the Commission you ought to
20 reconsider this in light of what we've done.
21 Supreme Court is considering Bates.

1

opinion, written by Justice Blackmun, refers to the AMA *s

2 current standards.

The Court says professional societies

3 should help to define the line between deceptive and
4 nondeceptive practices — precisely what the AHA had done 14
5 months earlier.

And as the law further developed, values

6 changed, the AMA continued to revise and to improve its

7 guidelines.
8

You would think the FTC would have given us a

9 medal.
10 on

11

Instead, we had a long, tedious trial concentrating

the events of the *20s, and the

’30s, and the

the *50s, and the *60s and the early

'40s, and

'70s, all pre-Goldfarb,

12 in what Justice Jackson when he wrote the opinion in

1952 in

13 Oregon State Medical Society called a great amount of
14 archaeology.
15

After exhuming all this archaeology, the FTC

16 introduced no evidence whatever on the competitive impact of
17 the AMA's current policies on price, quality, availability
18 of medical care.
19

We called witnesses like the late Dr. Michael

20 Halberstam,
21

the late Dr. France Inglefinger, who was then

the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine; and they

22 told how the practices that we thought were misleading could

23 horribly misguide and mislead patients, particularly the
24 poor, the unsophisticated.
25

We showed through the tragic testimony of victims,

1

particularly women who responded to ads about cosmetic

2 surgery, who ended up being butchered on a filthy operating
3

5

table and even to death.
The response of the FTC was rescind all your
guidelines, get out of the business of trying to define the

6 line between deceptive and nondeceptive practices, make no

7 pronouncements whatever on advertising for two years, and
8 then even after the two years don’t do anything without our
9
10

permission first.
We went to the FTC.

We said good lord, if

11

Hippocrates were alive today, he'd need your permission

12

before he could write the Hippocratic oath.

AFTERNOON SESSION
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Minow, you may resume

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEWTON N. MINOW, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — Resumed

6

MR. MINOW*

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

7 Court*
8

Just at the break I was saying we then appealed to

9 the full Commission.

The Commission made no analysis of any

10 kind about whether our current positions promoted or impeded
11 competition.

They didn’t even look at any anti-competitive

12 consequence, pro-competitive consequence.

Then in a curious

13 opinion it said that it itself was not capable of writing
14 new guidelines with respect to advertising? but then in a
15 process which it called exegesis, it then proceeded to say
16 that our guidelines were "troublesome," "worriesome,"
17 "overbroad."
18

We’ve got a strange opinion.

It's not a case

19 where the FTC is saying we have a better set of guidelines
20 that we want you to follow.

It's not a case where the FTC

21 is saying why we think your guidelines are wrong or violate
22 the law.

It’s not a case where the FTC found that our

23 current guidelines have any anti-competitive consequence.
24

It is a case where the law, where social values

25 were exploding and changing very quickly, where Goldfarb,

Now, in the light of Bates why does the FTC press
Why are we still fighting?
f

5

QUESTION*

Well, did you press your W.T. Grant and

6 Company argument before the FTC?
7

MR. MINOW*

Very much. Justice Rehnquist.

We also

8 did at the Court of Appeals.

We said there's no cognizable

9 risk of any recurrence here.

All these practices have

10 stopped.

But the FTC said in the exercise of its discretion

11 that our pre-Goldfarb orders, pre-Goldfarb orders violated
12 the Federal Trade Commission Act, and therefore, in its
13 discretion it would take the action that it did.
14

Now, I think there is an important question of

15 jurisdiction involved.
16 on.

Perhaps that’s why the FTC presses

I think the FTC is stretching to establish a precedent

17 that it has jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission
18 Act over not-for-profit professional associations.
19

Unlike the Sherman Act, unlike the Clayton Act,

20 the Federal Trade Commission Act does not apply to
21 everybody.

The Clayton Act, passed at the same Congress as
3

22 the Federal Trade Commission Act, applies to all
23 associations, all persons.

But when it got to writing the

24 Federal Trade Commission Act, Congress very carefully
25 limited the language of the FTC’s jurisdiction to an
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

association "organized to carry on business for its own

2 profit or the profit of its members."

Unlike the Sherman

3

Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act is not a carefully

4

studied attempt to bring everyone within its jurisdiction.

5

Now, the three not-for-profit institutions,

6 professional associations that are here simply are not
7

organized to carry on business for their own profit or for

8 that of their members.

It is undisputed, undisputed in the

9 record, even taking the FTC's witness, that the bulk, the
10

principal part of each association's resources are devoted

11

to furthering not economic interests, not profit.

12

It is equally undisputed that when the Federal

13

Trade Commission Act was passed in 1914 that learned

14

professions were not regarded as business.

15
16
17

QUESTIONi

Does the AMA conduct any business

enterprise other than perhaps the AMA Journal?
MB. MINOWs

The AMA's biggest activity in dollars

18

is publishing, and a lot of scientific journals, magazines.

19

On its business activities it pays taxes.

The bulk of its

20 activity involves accreditation of medical schools,
21

scientific work, research, validating drugs.

The Chief

22 Justice is familiar with its work involving prisons and
23

health in prisons.

24

involving advancing health is the bulk of its activity.

25

It's involved fundamentally in work

Now, we don't suggest that the medical profession
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is outside the antitrust laws.

2 all.

We don’t suggest that at

We understand that the Justice Department can invoke

3

the Sherman Act against professionals in the federal

4

courts.

5

delicate assessments required of purpose and effect required

The federal courts are equipped to make the

6 to apply antitrust standards to the not-for-profit sector.
7

But the FTC, we contend, with its tunnel vision is not so

8 equipped to make those judgments.
9

We do say the FTC was on the right track in —

10

QUESTION*

Well, you wouldn't suggest that would

11

be a reason for deciding in your favor.

12

saying is that Congress didn’t intend it to cover it, is

13

that it?

MR. MINOWs

What you’re really

Justice White, I was just saying

Congress didn’t intend —
QUESTION*

I mean Congress might have covered it

whether they had the ability or not.
MR. MINOWj
originally.

We think Congress did not intend it

Moreover, Congress did not intend it in 1977.

20 The FTC went to Congress in —
21

QUESTION

1

But that question doesn't depend on how

22 able the FTC is.
23

MR. MINOWi

No, but we think the FTC was designed

24

at the beginning, based on its legislative history, to have

25

expertise involving industries, and there was nothing at all
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

n r. onnoA lono'i

1

talked about at that time involving the professions.

2

In 1977 the FTC went to Congress and said we’d

3 like you. Senators, Congressmen, to change the law to expand
4 our jursidiction over the not-for-profit sector.

I think

5 that was the right way to deal with this question.
6 went to Congress.

They put in their case.

7 no, absolutely no.

Congress said

So the law was not changed in 1977.

8

To show you that another reason —

They

That doesn’t tell us what the law was.

MR. MINOW:

The law was left as it was written in

1914.

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

MR. MINOW:

14

QUESTION:

To show you again its —
The proposed change, Mr. Minow, would

15 have added all nonprofit corporations, right?
16

MR. MINOW:

That’s correct, including professional

17 associations as well.
18

QUESTION:

Right.

Do you think that it makes any

19 difference how much economic assistance an organization such
20 as the AMA would give to its members?
21

Could it change its

activities in such a way as to bring it under the act, in

22 your view, by increasing the amount of the assistance?

23

MR. MINOW:

We think that the statutory language,

24 unlike the FTC’s argument, first of all talks about profit
25 rather than economic benefit.

We think any not-for-profit
12

1 association, whether it be the Smithsonian Institution, the
2 American Bar Association, or the American Medical
3 Association, any such institution offers some benefits to
4 its members, whether it be — whether I'm involved in public
5 broadcasting, whether it be involved in getting a free
6 subscription to a magazine, or free parking, or buying
7 insurance or whatever.
8

There's some amount of it.

He say when the bulk, predominant part of an

9 activity and its purpose and its motivation is not designed
10 for its own profit or that of its members, then clearly it's
11 not within the Act.
12

QUESTION*

Well, when you say the bulk do you have

13 any percentage figure in mind?
14

MR. NINOW;

Well, the FTC says you should weigh

15 your budget and see what it is.

If you take that test, we

16 don't think that's a very sensible test, but if you take
17 that test, we each produced experts.

Our experts said 91

18 percent goes for scientific, educational.

Their experts

19 said something like 35 percent goes for economic benefits;
20 35 to 43 they said goes for economic benefits.
21

I don't think that's it.

I think it’s whether.
a

22 it’s organized — I'll go back to the statutory language —
23 is it organized for the benefit of itself, for profit for
24 itself or its members.
25

What was its intention.

We recognize, Justice Rehnquist, that trade
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 associations are subject to the Act.
2

QUESTION*

Why are they?

We recognize that.
They don't make profit

3 themselves, but they're organized to —
4

MR. MINOW*

5

QUESTION*

For the profit of their members.
Well, doesn't the AMA have any impact

6 on the profitmaking capabilities of doctors?

They certainly

7 are in business for a profit.
8

MR. MINOW*

If it does, it’s insignificant.

The

9 Administrative Law Judge, Justice White, said that if the
10 AMA improves medical standards of medical schools or
11 advances health, that's for the economic benefit of the
12 doctors because that will produce more patients.
13 that's preposterous.

We think

That was not the purpose of doing

14 medical research or validating of drugs.
15

I think we're not any different from the lawyers,

16 or any other professional association, or librarians.

I

17 don't think people join professional associations with the
18 idea that they're going to make money off it.
19

QUESTION*

So what if the AMA, perhaps what it

20 does has a series of adult education programs for doctors to
21 keep them up to date.
22

MR. MINOW;

Would you believe that it was

23 contended here that our continuing education programs are
24 for the profit of our members, because if you learn
25 something there, you'll get more patients.

That's silly.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 That’s not why professionals conduct continuing education
2 programs.
3

It's to keep —
QUESTIONS

Well, that may not be why, but you

4 don’t suggest that it doesn’t help.
5

MR. MINOWs

Help advance your knowledge, help

6 advance your professional skills, yes, but you don’t go
7 there for profit.
8

QUESTIONS

Well, I don’t know.

The more skillful

9 the physician, I take it the more other physicians would
10 lean on him, for example.
11

QUESTIONS

Is the cost of attending those programs

12 deductible for income tax purposes?
13

MR. MINOWs

14

QUESTIONS

15

MR. MINOWs

I would think so, Justice Stevens.
Because they produce income.
I would think so, but I don’t think

16 that has anything to do with whether the AMA or the
17 Connecticut Medical Society or the New Haven Medical Society
18 were organized for the purpose of producing profit for their
19 members.

That’s a different question.

20

QUESTIONS

I suppose, Mr. Minow, that if it is

21 deductible, and I would assume that it is, it’s on the same
22 basis that a schoolteacher taking summer courses can deduct,
23 summer courses at the university.
24
25 — right.

MR. MINOWs

To advance your skills or advance your

I would think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

But that isn't probably profitmaking

2 except that it's profitable for the teacher in the long run,

but we would hope for the public, too.

MR. MINOW:

In 1978, as the Court knows, it decided

That is the third case.

As far as

we’re concerned, what's important here is Goldfarb, Bates,

case involved engineers, you judge as to whether it promotes

We've said to the FTC repeatedly why don't

11 you get the Consumer Protection Division of the FTC and do
12 something about stopping these things instead of trying to
13 deal with us who are trying to establish guidelines to
14 protect the public?

We get no answer.

The FTC says,

15 moreover, and I’m sure you'll hear from it, that there were
16 some activities post-Goldfarb by the states, by the local
17 societies.
18

I point out to the Court there are some 1,900

19 state and local medical societies in this gigantic country

With respect to the AMA, which is the party in the

1976 publication of its

standards did nothing whatever to do with advertising at any

time.

No, but I was giving you a hypothetical.
Yes.
Suppose it went that far.
Right.

Oh, I think that would be —

of course, under the Sherman Act it's been held that —

It would fall under Goldfarb then,

22 would it not?
23

MR. MINOW*

Yes, it would.

I'm not sure that it

would be under the Federal Trade Commission's jursidiction,

but certainly under Goldfarb it would, Mr. Chief Justice.

I thought your position was not that

MR. MINOWs

Well, but I was saying if there was an

8

QUESTION*

No, but say you have exactly the same

9 organization you have today.
10

MR. MINOW*

11

QUESTION*

Yes.
But then you engaged in the activity of

12 price fixing.
13

MR. MINOW*

I'd say we are certainly subject to

14 the Sherman Act —

16

MR. MINOW*

I know, but —
I think there's a serious question of

17 whether we — I do not change our position, Justice Stevens.
18

QUESTION*

Yes, that's what I thought.

Your

19 position is you're not a corporation, so even if you did
20 that, you would not be subject to the Federal Trade
21 Commission.
22

MR. MINOW*

We're not a corporation within the

23 meaning of Section 4.
24

QUESTION*

So you would not be subject to the

25 Federal Trade Commission Act even if you engage in price

MS. MINOW:

That’s correct.

We'd say that the

3 remedy lies — in fact, there have been cases, there have
4 been cases where state associations have been sued by the
5 Justice Department for such actions.

We say that’s where it

6 belongs.

Other states as well, other states as well.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Minow, is there a jurisdictional

8 agreement between the Department and the Commission in terms

9 of what kind of cases the Department will handle, or do you

know?

Not that we’re aware of.
Justice White.

Well, I’m

We're also counsel for

13 the American Bar Association in its case in this area where

They said it's finished, over, done.

MR. MINOW:

21

QUESTION:

No, no, no.
Well, are you telling us that as a

22 result of that development that you just mentioned that

23 Chief Justice Taft was not in any trouble by chairing the
24 commission that wrote the code of — what did they call it
25 — the canons of judicial ethics in that day back in

'25?

20

MR. MINOW;

He'd be glad to defend Chief Justice

2 Taft any time, Mr. Chief Justice, on that.

We think it was

3 a perfectly proper role in the administration of justice.
4

QUESTION;

To announce standards of ethics.

5

MR. MINOW;

6

QUESTION*

Yes.

We think that ethics —

Do you think there's any First

7 Amendment right on the part of the Bar Association or the
8 Medical Association to announce any standards it wants to?
9

MR. MINOWi

I think that professionals are

10 citizens who under the First Amendment have a right to
11 freely associate with each other, to join in trying to
12 establish professional ethical standards.

We recognize if

13 they got together and fixed prices or did something like
14 that, we recognize that's wrong.

But there is an area of

15 speech which is protected, which is constitutionally
16 protected.
17

You know, when we had Dr. Halberstam looking at it

18 from a doctor's point of view, what did Dr. Halberstam say
19 about this?

He said if there is anything that's

erosive to
that a

MR. MINOW:

Not in this case, Justice Rehnquist,

3 where we’re saying yes, advertise; in fact, we think that
4 that promotes competition to have information in the
5 marketplace for patients, we think it’s desirable, but don’t
6 do it in a false or misleading way.
7

QUESTION:

That's our position.

Well, I understood you to carve out

8 price fixing as always being subject to —
9

MR. MINOW:

10 don’t defend that.

I think that’s per se improper.

We

But what we do say is that when

11 professionals in this case are trying to advance ethical
12 standards for the benefit of patients, of informing patients
13 without deceiving them, we think the government ought to
14 encourage them, not condemn them.

We think that that’s

The record shows that the state licensing

16 body said we welcome the role of the professional
17 societies.

They help us.

This Court said in Bates we think

18 it's important.
19

I come back to what Judge Mansfield said.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Minow, before you close would you

21 just say a word or two about the contract practice aspect of
22 the case, because that really isn't right within the line of
23 cases you've been discussing.
24

MR. MINOW:

When the case began, when the FTC had

25 its first announcement of it, all the attention was on
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 advertising.

When they got into that and saw we had changed

2 our rules, they changed their focus to talking about
3 contract practice.
4

All those contract practice rules have gone by the

5 boards years, decades long ago.

Most of the doctors today,

6 Justice Stevens, who are in practice one way or another, in
7 HMDs, hospitals, are involved in some contractual
8 relationship for their services.

So we regard that as

9 archaic, gone? it has nothing to do with anything current of
10 any kind.
11

We don't defend those old practices.

We published

12 new ones in 1977 in the first edition of our guidebook that
13 we could, and that’s gone by the boards.
14

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We don't defend it.

Mr. Shapiro, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20 the Court:
21

In this case the Federal Trade Commission, acting

22 under Section 5 of the FTC Act, found a continuing
23 nationwide private agreement in restraint of trade among AMA
24 and its affiliates and its members.

This agreement was

25 effectuated by certain ethical restraints.

The restraints

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

on which the Commission focused were in effect at the time

2 the Commission filed its complaint in December 1975.

They

3 almost totally banned advertising by physicians, and they
4 protected traditional fee-for-service practice from
5 competition by alternative contract arrangements of
6 physicians.

So we dealt with advertising and what is

7 usually denominated by the American Medical Association as
8 contract practice.

9

Now, the Commission entered a cease and desist

10

order designed to eliminate the conspiracy, which was

11

nationwide, and its effects throughout the nation.

12

order was intended to leave physicians free to choose

The

13 whether and how and with whom they will make contractual
14 arrangements for their services and whether and how they
15 will compete through nondeceptive advertising.

It was

16 intended to open the previously blocked flow of information
17 needed by consumers seeking access to the market for medical
18 services, for I emphasize to Your Honors that there is a
19 market.
20
21

Now, the Commission also found that because
advertising in the medical context involves public interest

22 considerations sharply different from those applicable in

23 the ordinary commercial context that the American Medical
24 Association and similar organizations may and should
25 continue through ethical standards to police false or
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 deceptive or oppressive advertising by physicians.
2

The issues that my brother has discussed with you

3 are two.

First, does the Commission have jurisdiction over

4 AMA under Section 4 of the FTC Act; that is, is the American
5 Medical Association a corporation within the meaning of that
6 statute.

And should the Commission have terminated the case

7 after AMA began to make changes subsequent to the filing of
8 the complaint.
9

Now, the only matters before the Commission when

10 that occurred are AMA's statements in April 1976 dealing
11 with advertising, and its March 1977 revision of its
12 opinions and reports.
13

I think that I should touch a bit on the

14 chronology because I think it’s important.

The April 1976

15 statement was not an abstract new piece of writing.

The AMA

16 was very careful in drafting that statement to assert that
17 it was reaffirming its prior position on advertising.
18 Moreover, the Commission — all this is in the findings,
19 incidentally — the Commission found that this April 1976
20 statement and the March 1977 version of it reflected a very
21 close link to the previous restrictions.

The statements did

22 not contain any express recision of what had gone before.
23 There is no statement in this record in which AMA tells the
24 affiliates, who are the means by which this conspiracy is
25 enforced, that they are to disregard the previous
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

restrictions.

It doesn’t even identify what they are to

2 disregard.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but some previous restrictions

4 were eliminated.
5

MR. SHAPIRO:

Hell, we have had some difficulty

6 identifying precisely what was eliminated.

7

QUESTION:

8 no change at all in

9

'76 and '77?

MR. SHAPIRO:

10 is
11

Well, are you suggesting that there was

It was so highly ambiguous that it

unclear whether there was a change or not.

The

Commission ultimately concluded that there had not been any

12 really clear,

unambiguous abandonment of the conspiracy.

13 This was reflected in other findings.

For example, in the

14 very statements which AMA says today represented a change,
15 it was also saying that local societies could have
16 restrictions that exceed anything that AMA had in its
17 current principles of ethics with respect to advertising.
18 It left the ban against solicitation in the principles of
19 ethics unchanged.
20
21

AMA’s own witnesses who were put on in surrebuttal
to explain its current position on advertising — and this

22 included the chairman of its board of trustees, a members of

23 its House of Delegates, chairman of the section on medical
24 schools — each seemed to be stating positions that were
25 clearly reflected in what had gone before.
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Moreover, and perhaps most important given the

2 fact that we are concerned with dissipating the effects of
3 conspiracy, the evidence before the Commission indicated
4 that even after AMA's March 1976 statements the old
5 restrictions were being applied by AMA's affiliates in
6 numerous circumstances, ranging from one of the Connecticut
7 petitioner's warnings to an ophthalmologist who had
8 benefitted from some newspaper publicity to the Maryland
9 Medical Society's published ethical guide, based on AMA
10 standards, which condemned advertising —
11

QUESTIONS

Well, what do you do with a statement

12 in the -- the '76 statement which says that the principles
13 do not proscribe advertising; they proscribe solicitation?
14 Now, there was no statement like that before that.
15

MR. SHAPIROs

Hell, there was. Your Honor, and

16 that is one of the interesting things.

In the record you

17 will find, in the findings —
18

QUESTION;

You mean they never have banned

19 advertising, is that it?
20

MR. SHAPIRO;

Hell, that was their position at

21 times.
22

QUESTION;

And yet you need a cease and desist

23 order to keep them from banning advertising?
24

MR. SHAPIRO;

Hell, the wording of their position

25 has changed considerably, I must say.

He have outlined in

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the brief and the Commission has outlined in its findings

2 positions by the FTC which seemed to indicate that all
3 advertising was bad, that all solicitation includes
4 advertising.

And then there would be a slight shift because

5 they would allow obviously some of the simplest forms of
6 advertising — a card, a sign, an official directory.

So

7 that the Commission’s finding on this matter is that the
8 AKA's abandonment was highly ambiguous.
9

In fact, how ambiguous can best be seen, I think,

10 by looking at something that AMA has brought to the Court's
11 attention, although it's extra-record, in January of 1980
12 they finally abolished the ban on solicitation entirely from
13 their principles of ethics, July of 1980, and in January of
14 1981 they issued a complete new edition of the opinions and
15 reports which very clearly seems to be an effort to come
16 into conformity with the law by providing that doctors can
17 advertise as long as it's not misleading, or false, or
18 deceptive, or oppressive.
19

QUESTIONS

Let me back up a little bit on

20 something that seems to me very fundamental here, Nr.
21 Shapiro.

Do you think there is any authority in the state

22 or the government or by statute that would limit the rights
23 of a voluntary group of lawyers, doctors, dentists, or any
24 other profession from announcing a set of standards that
25 precluded advertising and solicitation?
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MB. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think if there

QUESTION:

4 join or not join?
5

A voluntary association that you can
I’m not talking about an integrated bar.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, yes, I think so in this way.

6 Certainly the voluntary association is not, of course,
7 subject to the First Amendment itself, but the voluntary
8 association if it's an association of entrepreneurs is
9 subject to the requirement that it not suppress competition
10 or restrain trade in violation of the antitrust laws.
11

QUESTION:

Well, does the announcement — you go

12 into that very rapidly for me — the announcement of a Ten
13 Commandments by a lawyers’ club or a doctors' society, you
14 say that the First Amendment doesn’t protect that?
15

MR. SHAPIRO:

The announcement is certainly

16 something that is within the First Amendment, but if those
17 words are words that as implemented add up to a restraint of
18 trade — and that is what we have here, a conspiracy in
19 restraint of trade — through the application of these
20 restrictions —
21

QUESTION:

You're making that jump very fast.

I’m

22 trying to take you one step at a time.
23

MR. SHAPIRO:

are announcing it, think the profession ought to be

HR. SHAPIRO;

8 of course, involves a slightly different issue, but Goldfarb

1

HR. SHAPIRO:

Well, if the announcement of the

2 code carries with it the effects of a restraint of trade,
3

then using the Central Hudson analysis that unlawful speech

4

or speech in aid of unlawful activity is not protected by

5

the First Amendment, then we would have to say that the

6

restraint of trade tak.es the conduct and the utterances

7

outside the protection of the First Amendment.

8
9

Now, the First Amendment was invoked before the
Commission by the Petitioners in this case and in the Second

10

Circuit, but only in connection with challenges to the

11

order.

always affected through speech and writings.

Amendment.

25

That's our essential position on the First

Now, there’s much debate about what the Commission
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

did or said with respect to AMA's changes here.

What the

2 Commission did was to examine the changes very closely under
3

the standards mentioned by Justice Hehnquist, the W.T. Grant

4

standards.

5

before the Commission that we couldn't even do that, that we

In fact, AMA's argued before this Court and

6 had to judge their liability on their post-complaint changes.
7

I know of no case that says that.

The Oregon

8 Medical Society, which my brother invokes, doesn't support
9

it.

The Commission examined the conduct alleged in the

10

complaint, found a violation, and looked to see the

11

relationship between that conduct and the post-complaint

12

changes.

13

What it was concerned with was three questions,

14

once it had found this nationwide conspiracy which the

15

evidence showed had gone on with the continued enforcement

16

of the old standards.

17

post-complaint changes by AMA would dissipate the effects cf

18

the conspiracy, because that, after all, is the first

19

concern of any remedy in a conspiracy case.

It looked first to see whether the

20

The second question was whether the post-complaint

21

changes reflected a clear and unambiguous abandonment of the

22 conspiracy, not only by AMA but by the other members,
23

because the conspiracy was between AMA and its federated

24

affiliates.

25

And finally, the Commission had to consider
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

whether there was a cognizable danger of recurrence.

This

2 kind of analysis is essentially what I think is implied in
3

two categories of cases:

4

reflected, for example, in FTC against Colgate concerning

5

the Commission's remedial responsibilities and discretion;

first, the line of cases

6 and secondly, the line of cases reflected in W.T. Grant and
7

cases in that line.

8
9

The issues thus never went to AMA's post-complaint
— I mean the issue about AMA's post-complaint changes

10

didn’t go to its liability; they went rather to the

11

appropriateness under the public interest of a remedy.
Now, the Commission examined at length that

12

13

question.

14

these tests.

15

take up the Court's time with details further.

16

It found that AKA's changes simply did not meet

I must say I would like to invite the Court’s

7

Section 4 of the Commission’s order,

which I think you’ll find it about page 371 of Petitioner’s

8 appendix, Section 4 is designed to achieve compliance, and
9

what it focuses on is a requirement that ABA change its

10

ethical standards to comply with the order to get rid of the

11

restrictions.

12

by January of 1981 it has done that.

13

All right.

ABA says at least by July of —

It also requires that steps be taken to assure

that the affiliates agree to obey the order.

Before you go to that, let me see if I

You say that Goldfarb and

Would you

20 say that's a violation of law?

MR. SHAPIRO:

That would be a violation of law,

22 because as in the Engineers case, it is a prohibition

MR. SHAPIRO:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

And you think that's the same as a

3 pledge not to advertise or solicit?
4

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that they're quite close in

5 the sense that advertising is an offering of services, and
6 you're sort of pledging I will never make certain public
7 announcements of my availability.
8

The market aspects of a profession — and that's

9 all that the Commission is interested in, not the
10 doctor-patient relationship obviously -- the market aspects
11 of a profession, the commercial aspects of a profession are
12 subject to the antitrust laws, as in Engineers; and that is
13 what the Commission was addressing.

I don't understand your answer to the

If in this town, the District of Columbia,

16 twenty lawyers get together and say we are banding together

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, a very small number —

My number is twenty.
Twenty.

I think that —

And if you push me, I'll take it to six.
Well, the essence of the violation

24 is the agreement not to advertise.
25

QUESTION:

Well, that's an agreement.

MR. SHAPIRO;

And that would be a violation within

2 — under the rule of reason, I might add, if someone can
3 come up with justification, advertising in a professional
4 context is always assessed under the rule of reason.
5

QUESTION:

Could one lawyer say I’m a very ethical

6 lawyer and not be ethical?
7

MR. SHAPIRO;

Oh, yes.

There’s no agreement then.

8 no agreement.

Then it will come down to two, wouldn't

10 it?
11

MR. SHAPIRO;

But two is — if it involves an

12 agreement —
13

QUESTION;

Yeah.

14

MR. SHAPIRO;

— Not to advertise, it's an

15 agreement not to compete, and an agreement not to compete is
16 an agreement under restraint of trade.

MR. SHAPIRO;

QUESTION;

13

MR. SHAPIRO;

A violation of law?

No, because law firm partnerships —

A law firm is a voluntary association.
It’s not the voluntary association

14

that's the essence of it; it's the integration of

15

competitive functions to achieve a more competitive

16

function.

Like a corporation?

MR. SHAPIRO;

— Like a corporation or like the

competition through their combination.

21

Now, I'd like to turn to the jurisdictional

22 question very briefly.
23
24
25

The Commission's holding on

jursidiction is relatively easily stated.
First, the Commission does not claim broad
jurisdiction over nonprofit associations.

It claims

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

jurisdiction over nonprofit associations made up of

2 entrepreneurs when those associations are engaged in
3

substantial part in operating for the profit of those

4

entrepreneur members.

5

That is the essence of the holding.

What the Commission has said is that if you look

6 at AKA you will find that it is engaged in many praiseworthy
7

noncommercial activities of all kinds, but you will also

8 find that in many respects it functions like a trade
9
10

association.
The findings of the Commission were that the bulk

11

of AMA's members are engaged in the profit-motivated private

12

practice of medicine, in the traditional practice of

13

medicine, fee-for-service medicine.

14

in that aspect of their practice like any other

15

entrepreneurs.

own account.

17

In short, doctors are

They’re entrepreneurs operating for their

When you combine persons together into an

18

association, the association may be a nonprofit organization

19

like any other trade association, but if it's acting for the

20 profit of those members in part, in substantial part, then
21

we think that it fits within the definition of a corporation

22 in the Federal Trade Commission.
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, I’m interested in your use

24

of the word "entrepreneurial."

What about an association of

25

ministers, say the Southern Baptist Association?

Congress chose that word "profit," and so it

7 limited the FTC's jurisdiction to the type of organization
8 which involves those people who are entrepreneurs for profit.

10 interested in the profit of its members?
11
12 yes.

Properly.

17 you, is the situation of the AMA.

No.

19 attempted; I haven't yet — drawn a line between profit in
20 the sense of somebody who is engaged in business to gain
21 income over costs, revenue over costs, which all doctors
22 have to do when they're operating their office practices and
23 their fee-for-service practices, as distinguished from the

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I seem to have lost my way within the

But it’s a document which simply says ’’What's the

7 AMA done for you lately?"
8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

You're right.

75A.

And I won't go through it step by

11 listings ranging from things AMA has done to enhance the
12 productivity of practice to things AMA has done to cut down
13 the competition of competing Health Maintenance

14 Organizations.

And these are the kinds of indicia that the

15 Commission went through very carefully and at great length.
16

QUESTION:

What is the date of that, "What has the

17 AMA done for you lately?"
18

MR. SHAPIRO:

I believe that was 1975.

There is,

QUESTION;

7

Rather than focusing under a W.T. Grant

standard on the AMA itself, which I take it the FTC did.
MR. SHAPIRO;

8
9

Well, in answer —

We did focus on it, but we do have a

remedial responsibility.

Now, if the local affiliates are

10

as independent in ethical matters as AMA claims, not only is

11

our uncontested finding of conspiracy wrong, but then it's

12

merely a matter of — then its mere publication of modified

13

statements won’t dissolve the conspiracy.
On the other hand, if the affiliates can be

14
15

expected to adhere to AMA’s published statements, then AMA

16

shouldn’t be denying responsibility for correcting the

17

effects of the conspiracy.

MR. MINOWs

But in light of Goldfarb —
Witness the split in the court below.
Yes, but in light of

16 nonexistent.

The world fundamentally changed.

17 changed, and the AMA responded.

Well, nevertheless, they filed the

As of the date of the complaint do you challenge

9 the finding of liability?
10

11

HR. MINOW:

Yes, we do, because we would say that

the guidelines we had at that time met the law at that time;

12 that the law changed and as quickly as we could in a

13 membership organization with hundreds of thousands of people
14 going through the process spelled out by its procedures and
15 constitution, as quickly as anybody humanly could, before
16 any other profession did it we responded.

So I would say

17 yes, we were all right under that standard.
18

Never today did the FTC say that our

19 were wrong.
20

21

'76 standards

Never did they point out why they were wrong.

And it's nonsense to say there was a conspiracy.
The brief if you read it — you know, the dentists

22 entered into an agreement with the FTC that said whatever

23 happens to the doctors will also happen to the dentists.
24 That shows how interested the FTC is in the particular facts
25 about associations or differences between the professions.
