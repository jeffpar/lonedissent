ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH R. REED, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REED;

8
9 Court,

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

this case is here on certiorari to review what the

10 lower courts have characterized
11 law on which

as a controlling question of

there is substantial ground for difference of

12 opinion.

13

The United States District Court denied our motion

14 for partial summary judgment on the question of a violation,
15 on the ground that the legality of Respondent's agreed upon
16 fee schedules was to be judged

under the rule of reason

17 rather than per se rule.
18

QUESTION;

He did deny it with leave to file a

19 similar motion later after more discovery had taken place,
20 didn't it?
21

MR. REED;

To be sure, and we subsequently filed,

22 Justice F.ehnquist, a motion for partial summary judgment on
23 the question of violation, based on the rule of reason.
24 That motion was filed in support of our papers for a
25 preliminary injunction, and both of those questions were

2 interlocutory appeal and the appeal of the denial of summary
3 judgment motion.

4

QUESTIONj

Summary judgment in your favor.

5

NR. REED;

No, Your Honor.

Summary judgment had

6 been denied by the District Court under both the rule of
7 reason theory and per se theory, and our request for
8 continuation of the preliminary injunction was also denied
9 under the theory that it did not violate either the per se
10 sta ndard and there w

1 necessary for this Court’s decision are clear and simple,
2 undisputed, and have been established by Respondent's own
3 Rule 36 admissions and the affidavits Respondents themselves
4 have prepared and submitted and filed with the lower courts,
5 and those facts are really only three.
6

One, Respondents are trade associations of

7 competing physicians.

Two, as part of their activities,

8 Respondents formulate and prepare lists of prices coverina
9 the range of services that they perform.

Three, as part of

10 their function, the Respondents prepare minimum standards
11 which they utilize in endorsing pre-paid health plans,

12 whether insurance health plans or by third party payors such
13 as the state of Arizona, which reimburses health care plans
14 as an employer.
15

For an insurer or an employer to receive

16 Respondents ' endorsement, the third party payor must agree
17 to accept these minimum standards, one of which is the
18

agreement to pay Respondent's members up to the amount set

19

forth in the agreed upon fee schedules.

In return, in

20 return, Respondents* members agree not to bill any more than
21 what is set forth in those fee schedules.

22

Those facts, Justice Rehnquist, are established

23 beyond cavil.
24

QUESTION;

I thought that the physician was free

25 to bill the patient whatever he wanted.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. REED:

That's right, Your Honor.

The

2 physician can — a member of the society, a member of one of
3 the Respondents can bill less than the fee schedule.
4

QUESTION;

What about more?

5

MR. REED:

Not at all.

6 of paper that said more.

He could prepare a piece

He has been guaranteed of

7 receiving what is set in the fee schedule.
8

QUESTION;

And if the patient wishes to pay him

9 more, and he sends a bill to the patient for more, and the
10 patient pays him more, he doesn't have to return it, does he?
11

MR. REED:

Not at all, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Can he enforce his higher bill in court

13 against a patient?
14

MR. REED:

He is under a contractual obligation as

15 a member of the society, of the Respondent society -16

QUESTION:

Not to.

Is that it?

17

MR. REED:

-- not to seek to collect --

18

QUESTION;

Well, can the patient defend on that

I would think, so, Your Honor.

19 basis?

20

I would

21 think the claim would be between the insurance carrier —
22

QUESTION;

Well, do we know from any Arizona court

23 decision whether the patient can defend on the basis of this
24 agreement?
25

MR. REED;

There is not an Arizona court decision

1 I can cite you to, Your Honor.

I would suggest. Justice

2 Rehnguist, that questions such as that are irrelevant.
3 Going back into the decisions of this Court, starting out
4 with Justice Peckham's opinion in the Trans-Hissouri Freight
5 Association case, continuing through the recent decision in
6 cases such as California Retail Liquor Dealers versus Hidcal
7 Aluminum, any agreement, any agreement among competitors
8 raising, lowering, stabilizing prices is itself a per se
9 violation of the antitrust laws.
10

QUESTION:

Yes, but Justice Rehnquist's question

11 really goes to whether or not there is any such agreement

12 like that at all.

If these doctors are completely free,

13 despite what some piece of paper says, to charge the patient
14 more, and they do, what kind of an agreement to set prices

15 is there ?
16

HR. REED:

Your Honor, any agreement among

17 competitors to set prices is a violation of the law.
18

QUESTION:

Hell, I am saying, is there an

19 agreement if the first line says, we agree, and the next

20 line says, we don't agree?
21

HR. PEED:

Hr. Justice White, any agreement among

22 competitors to. set prices is a per se violation.

Any person

23 obviously has a legal right net to abide by that agreement.
24 An agreement to fix prices is legally unenforceable.

The

25 oil companies in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company could not legally

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 have been compelled to abide by the price fixing agreement.
2

QUESTION:

Following up on Justice White's

3 question/ supposing that the agreement, if there be such, of
4 the foundation says that you will not charge more than -5 you will not be reimbursed or charge more than 5900 for this
6 service, and the physician gets his $900 reimbursement but
7 bills-the patient f1,600, and the patient says, no, I don't
8 want to pay $1,600 and doesn't pay the $1,600.

Can the

9 physician nonetheless sue him and collect it?
10

MS. PEED;

I would think, not, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

What makes you think not?

12

ME. REED;

Because the agreement among the

13 physicians, one of the criteria on which they signed their
14 membership application when they joined the foundation is
15 agree not to seek recovery,

not to receive more than the

16 amount of money set forth by the fee schedule.

Anybody can

17 file a piece of paper and go down to court and seek recovery
18 on a claim, seek recovery on a claim, whether it has merit
19 or not.

There is a contractual obligation and an agreement

20 among the competing physicians that they will accept the
21 amount set forth in the fee schedules.
22

QUES.TI0N:

Where is that in the record

in this

MS. REED:

Your Honor, I would direct your

23 case?
24

25 attention to Page 9 of Sespondent's reply brief on the

1 merits.

ME. SEEDi

Red.

Quoting,

"Foundation member

4 health care providers agreed to accept as payment in full
5 for patients covered by Foundation endorsed insurance the
6 maximum level of reimbursement from the insurer for services
7 rendered."
8

I also direct your attention to the affidavit of

9 Thomas Finley, the executive director of one of the
10 foundations.
11 at Paragraph

It appears at Page 78 of

the joint appendix,

16 of his affidavit, and I think his statement

12 there nicely sums up what is involved here.

This is an

13 affidavit prepared by the Respondents and signed by one of
14 Respondent's executives.
15

Quote:

"The Foundation does exercise direct control over

16 the establishment of maximum payment rates for medi cal
17 services

Direct control.

That is his language.

Each d octor who is a member of the

20 Foundation expressly agrees that covered expenses w ill be
21 reimbursed at no more than the maximum rate established by
22 the Foundation,."
23

Period, close quote.

There is no question, Your Honor, that there is

24 that express agreement.
25

QUESTION;

Will be reimbursed by whom?

o

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

HR. SEED:

1

By the insurance company or other third

2 party payor.
3

QUESTION:

But not necessarily by the patient.

4

ME. REED:

That is correct, Your Honor, except to

5 the extent of the deductible coverage, or the first $100
6 that may be paid in any one calendar year.
7

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there a term of the

8 agreement that the doctor will charge nothing to the
9 customer except the reimbursible expense?
10

MS. SEED:

Excuse me. Justice Stevens.

I am not

11 sure I understood.

12

QUESTION:

Does not the overall agreement provide

13 that the doctor who joins the plan when he is performing
14 services for an insured person under the plan will collect
15 all of his fees from the insurance company except for the
16 deductible amount?
17

MS. SEED:

That's correct.

That's correct.

18

QUESTION:

So there won’t be an additional charge

19 to the customer if the agreement is adhered

20

MS. REED:

to.

That is absolutely correct.

That this

21 may be characterized as a maximum fee schedule is of no
22 moment.

Again,, the cases have consistently held in this

23 Court that any agreement among competitors raising,
24 lowering, stabilizing, tampering with prices is a per se

25 violation.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Justice Peckham’s opinion in Trans-Missouri made

1

2 that point, one of the first price fixing cases before this
3 Court.

The most recent case to present this issue, Midcal

4 Aluminum, again, maximum price fixing is unlawful.
5

QUESTION:

What is the Foundation's share of the

6 market in the state?
7

ME. REED:

Foundation member physicians have

8 approximately 70 percent of the physicians in the area as
9 members.

The precise market share I cannot tell you.

Your

10 Honor, the precise market share is not a matter that is
11 relevant either to a per se analysis or rule of reason

12 analysis.
13

Justice Rehnquist, if you go back to Judge Addison

14 Pipe, and take it through to former Solicitor General Robert

15 Borak's most recent, I think very thoughtful analysis of
16 antitrust paradox, makes a very telling point.
17

QUESTION:

Well, neither of them were members of

18 this Court at that time.
19

MR. SEED:

To be sure, Your Honor.

Fortunately,

20 however, I think the rationale was accepted by this Court
21 when it affirmed the Nationwide Trailer Rental case and
22again in

the Broadcast Music case by Justice White, and

23 again in the GTE Sylvania case,

and the point is this, that

24 where there is economic integration,
25 pooling of productive assets, a

where there is a

sharing of risk and

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 benefits, an incidental elimination of price competition is
2 permissible.

3

Thus, Judge Taft in Addison, Justice White, you

4 made this point yourself in BKI when you made mention of
5 partnerships -6

QUESTION";

That was a Court opinion.

MS. SEED;

To be sure.

The Court

7 did it.
8

When you made the

9 reference to partnerships, mergers, or joint ventures as
10 being examples where economic assets have been
11

12 economic integration.

There,

pooled, there

there is an

Even where there are only two

13 individuals, and this is Robert Borak’s example, two
14 individuals that legitimately form a partnership and pool
15 their assets, if they independently, without pooling their
16 assets, agree to eliminate competition, that is a per se
17 violation without regard to their market share.
18

QUESTION;

If the Foundation had only 10 percent

19 of the market in Maricopa County, would that be the case?
20

MS. PEED;

21 integration of

Absolutely.

Absent an economic

the productive assets, whether it is 10

22 percent or whether it is only two physicians,

agreeing on

23 prices, that is a per se violation, absent an economic
24 integration of pooling of assets, absent the sharing of risk
25 benefits.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

Nr. P.eed, that may be a fair inference

2 from what the Court has said, but the Court has never quite
3 said that, has it?

It has never said that two people can't

4 horizontally fix prices.

There is no such case out of this

5 Court that holds that on all fours.
6

SR. REED:

That two persons cannot horizontally --

7

QUESTION:

Two corner grocers get together and

8 say, we won't charge less than a dollar for hamburger.
9 There is no such case, is there?
10

NR. REED:

Not two persons.

But I think. Justice

11 Stevens, if you refer back to Justice Douglas's opinion in

12 Socony-Vacuum, he did indicate, and I think very definitely
13 in his Footnote 59, that it matters not.

The Section 1

14 violation is complete, even though the conspirators do not
15 have the power to carry out their agreement.

16 accomplish the end is not relevant.

Power to

It is not material to

17 the violation.

18

So, to be sure, we have not had before this Court

19 the precise situation of those two individuals, but we have
20 had
21

the issue decided.
QUESTION:

I think all the price fixing cases in

22 this Court hav.e been cases in which the defendants had
23 market dominance.

It may be that isn't required, and I

24 agree with you that Justice Douglas's language certainly
25 doesn’t seem to require that.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ME. REED:

2 case. Your Honor.

I think that is not necessarily the

In the opinion in the Nationwide Trailer

3 case, which was affirmed procurium by this Court, the
4 District Court was expressly unable to determine the market
5 share of the defendants and unable to determine that the fee
6 schedule had in fact been used.

It found that the members

7 of the trade association had among themselves prepared,
8 agreed upon, and published a fee schedule.

It had not -- it

9 did not make any finding in its findings of fact that
10 expressly said that it didn't have the evidence to make any
11 finding, that it was used or that it was followed, and

12 absent any showing of market share, no ability to show that
13 they had the power to put it into effect.
14

Nonetheless, the District Court there held that

15 the mere preparation, publication, and circulation among its
16 members of a fee schedule was a per se violation, and this
17 Court affirmed that decision.

18

I think the Respondents here have gone much

19 further, gone much further than anything in any of the

20 earlier cases to come before this Court.

The people in

21 Socony-Vacuum, the realtors in National Association of Real
22 Estate Boards,, the lawyers in Goldfarb, the trailer rental
23 operators in the Nationwide Trailer case agreed among
24 themselves on the prices, on a

price list.

They had no

25 guarantee, however, that they would be able to receive the

they agreed upon in their price list.

And a person could not get the service

in this part of Virginia affected by Coldfarb from any

8 lawyer except by paying

that minimum fee.

9

different from a maximum fee?

10

MR. REED:

Isn't that quite

T believe so. Your Honor, and I believe

11 this case presents a more egregious.

The minimum, and while

12

it didn't occur in Goldfarb, it did occur in the National

13

Association of Real Estate Boards, where there was a stated

14

minimum, a number of transactions went down from there, and

15

in point of fact, transactions were made as noted by Justice

16

Douglas in that opinion, transactions were made below the

17

agreed upon price.

Your Honor, that is sufficient to

me to summary judgment on the question of the

22 violation.

I .think there is much more that we can go into

23

in the medical profession, but on the question of whether

24

Respondents'

25

a violation of the law, these facts those facts alone are

formulation and preparation of fee schedules is

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sufficient to establish a violation.
2

QUESTION;

Regardless of the market share or

3 anything else?
4

MR. REED;

Regardless of the market share.

The

5 only exception being the question, is there an economic
6 integration, is there a pooling of productive assets?
7 is not here.

There

And the simple agreement among non-integra ted

8 competitors, which is what we have, on a price schedule is
9 under the cases and in my view a per se violation of the
10 antitrust laws.
11

What has been done here is more than simply a

12 minimum violation, minimum fee schedule, rather.

The

13 members of this society had guaranteed themselves payment up
14 to the so-called maximum that they have agreed upon, and the

15 effect of this, the effect of this, Justice Hehnquist, I
16 think is evidenced pretty clearly by something that occurred
17 during the course of this litigation, wherein the District

18 Court — an injunction had remained in effect for a few
19 months, and Respondents'

members wanted to increase their

20 prices.
21

They went into the District Court and asked that

22 the preliminary injunction be lifted so that they could
23 increase their prices an aggregate of $1.8 million a month,
24 and they asked that as a condition of a continuation of this
25 preliminary injunction, if the injunction were to continue

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 enjoining them from increasing their fee schedule, the state
2 of Arizona would be required to post a bond of £1.8 million
3 a month for every month that they were enjoined from
4 promulgating a new fee schedule.
5

Even if Hespondents had not gotten the guarantee

6 that they would receive what they had agreed upon, even if
7 Respondents had done no more than agree upon a maximum level
8 of prices, establish maximum prices, that agreement would
9 still be — should still be per se unlawful.
10

I go back again to one of the first price fixing

11 cases to come before this Court, Justice Peckham's opinion

12 in Trans-Missouri, and he identified there the evil, one of
13 the evils of a maximum price fixing agreement among
14 competitors, and if I may take the liberty of quoting to the
15 Court from Page 323 of 166 US, "In business or trading
16 combinations, they may even temporarily or perhaps
17 permanently reduce the price of an article traded in or

18 manufactured".

Reduce the price.

"Trade or commerce under

19 those circumstances may nevertheless be badly and

20 unfortunately restrained by driving out of business the
21 small leaders and worthy men whose lives have been spent

22 therein . "
23

He went on on the next page to say, "In this

24 light, it is not material that the price of an article may
25 be lowered. "

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Mr. Peckham was talking hypothetical economics

2 there, but well based economics.
3

QUESTION;

But do we know that the same effects

4 would result in the physician patient service relationship
5 as between the railroad shipper analysis?
6

MR. REED

i

I think the economic effect of that,

7 Number One, to show that Justice Peckham was not off base is
8 seen in the second American Tobacco case.

The second

9 American Tobacco case, you will recall, is where the major
10 tobacco companies reduced their price on the cigarettes they
11 sold to provide a competitive alternative to the so-called

12 ten-cent brands.

By reducing their price, they kept the

13 ten-cent brands off the market.
14

The stated purpose for this -- for the original

15 inception of these foundations, and I am quoting from the
16 joint brief in opposition, the red one,

at Page 8, "is a

17 competitive alternative to the utilization of closed
18 prepaid

panel

health insurance plans", stated differently, a group

19 of competitors,

the Respondents here, reducing their prices

20 to compete with HMOs, just like — just like the major
21 tobacco companies reduced their prices to keep the ten-cent
22 cigarettes off. the market in the second American Tobacco
23 case.

7 But Chief Justice Warren made a very important point in the
8 Brown Shoe case, and that is that we should not protract
9 already complex antitrust cases bv looking into peripheral
10 economic facts.

QUESTION:

Well, but —

12

MR. REED:

And the per se rule in Northern Pacific

13 Railroad is recognized as being based in part upon the
14 necessity and the wisdom of avoiding unnecessary
15 expenditures of judicial resources.

The whole notion of

16 Rule 56 summary judgment proceedings is to decide cases
17 prior to trial, if possible, when all of the material facts
18 have been established beyond dispute.
19

QUESTION:

But how do you know when all the

20 material facts have been established?
21

MR. REED:

Eecause under Rules 56E and 56F, a

22 party posing a1 summary judgment motion has the obliaation of
23 identifying material issues of disputed fact that require a
24 trial, or under 56F, if there hasn't been enough of an
25 opportunity to conduct discovery, identifying the specific

those matters require a trial.

None of these matters are material.

The fact that a group of

Whether it be physicians, a health

16 group, or trailer rental, or a shipper consumer, none of
17 that varies at all?
MR. REED:

18

I think starting with Socony-Vacuum,

19 Justice Douglas said there that as far as the price fixing

21

goes, the Sherman Act establishes one rule of law for

all industries, and again in Goldfarb, and again in

21

I will,

that although the arrangement is

denominated a maximum fee arrangement, that the individual

have v.ery little incentive to charge less than the

23 prescribed

maximum.

In this case, it is stipulated that

of them do charge the maximum, and it is also

25 stipulated

that every year they hike the maximum further and

1 further, which raises the costs of the insurance companies
2 that do business with the foundations, and ultimately
3 redounds to the detriment of the consumers that pay for the

Our position is that it is harmful to consumers,

7

QUESTION;

Are the insurance companies objecting?

8

SR. SHAPIRO;

There is no indication of their

9 position in this record.
10

QUESTION;

Or of the non-member doctors?

11

MR. SHAPIRO;

12

Our submission is that the maximum fee schedules

No indication of that in this record

13 that were adopted by the foundations are in fact per se
14 violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and we further
15 contend that the per se rule can be applied at this stage of
16 the litigation, in view of the specific admissions which the
17 foundations made in the District Court.
18

I would like first to describe the legal standard

19 which governs in a case of this kind, and then explain why

20 Arizona was entitled to summary judgment under that standard
21

Ever since this Court's ruling in Sccony-Vacuum,

22 it has been black letter law that competitors may not
23 combine to restrain independent decision-making on price.
24 As the Court stated in Soccny, and I quote,

"Any combination

25 which tampers with price structures is engaged in an

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 unlawful activity."

And in the unanimous decision of this

2 Court in Kiefer-Stewart, the Court reaffirmed that an
3 agreement among competitors fixing maximum prices is subject
4 to the per se prohibition just like a uniform price
5 agreement or a minimum price agreement.
6

In Professional Engineers, the Court summarized

7 its past opinions concisely by stating that any agreement
8 that interferes with the setting of price by free market
9 forces is unlawful on its face.
10

Of course, the per se rule must be confined by the

11 scope of its rationale.

It applies to so-called naked

12 restraints which cut off competitive or independent
13 decision-making by independent rivals.

It does net

14 ordinarily apply to agreements on price which are necessary
15 components of joint productive activity.

This distinction

16 is illustrated by a familiar example.
17

If a group of attorneys gets together and

18 establishes a schedule of fees, this is a per se violation
19 as the Court held in the Goldfarb case.

20

QUESTION;

Minimum.

21

MR. SHAPIRO;

Minimum fees.

Minimum fees.

And under

22 Kiefer-Stewart,, maximum fees are subject to the same per se
23 prohibition .

But if that same group of lawyers gets

24 together and establishes a law firm,

they may agree on the

25 prices which they charge their clients.

Members of firms

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 are not expected to compete against one another or to
2 attempt to divert business from each ether.

Joint

3 productive activity depends on cooperation rather than
4 internal competition in an integrated business entity, such
5 as a partnership.
6

Accordingly, the relevant inquiry in this case is

7 twofold.

First, have competitors in fact entered into an

8 agreement limiting their pricing independence, and second,
9 if they have, is that agreement an essential facet of joint
10 productive activity, as in the case of a partnership or a
11

merger of medical practices into a health maintenance

12 organization?
13

In this case, these questions can all be answered

14 with dispatch.
15

In fact, all of the information that is

needed to render a judgment on liability is contained in the

16 foundation's very extensive admissions of fact which are on
17

18
19

Pages 156 through 273 of the joint appendix in this Court.
Let me now summarize what the foundations have in
fact admitted.

The doctor members of the foundations vote

20 by mail ballot on maximum fee schedules used to determine
21

the fees which insurance companies pay them, and they agree

22 to abide by those maximums.

If an insurance company wishes

23

to do business with the foundations, it must agree to pay

24

the doctors up to the maximum which they have jointly

25

pre scribed .

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The foundations have increased these maximums

2 nearly on a yearly basis since they were formed in

1969 and

3 1971, and only 5 to 15 percent of the doctors in Naricopa
4 Foundation bill less than the prescribed maximum.
5

Significantlywhen the foundations tried to

6 identify issues of fact for trial, they did not suggest that
7 the medical practices of their members were integrated into
8 a partnership or a joint venture arrangement.

The

9 undisputed fact is that the doctors here involved are
10 hundreds of independent practitioners engaged in traditional
11 fee for service medicine.

12

Accordingly, their price fixing falls into the

13 category of a naked restraint, and is not an essential facet
14 of

15

joint integrated medical practice.
We note in this connection that the claims payment

16 and review activities which the foundations carry on do not
17 require that the doctors prescribe their prices, and

the

18 foundations have never made any contrary assertion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPI R0, ESQ.

5

AMICUS CURIAE - RESUMED

6

MR. SHAPIRO;

Thank you, Mr. Chie f Justice,

7

Cur submission is that maximum pr ice fixing has

8 many of the objectionable features of an or dinary price
9 cartel, and that is the reason this Court c ondemned it in
10 Kiefer-Stewart as illegal per se.

11

For example, if the doctors presc ribe a maximum

12 price of £1,000 for a particular operation, and most of them
13 actually charge that maximum, as the record here shews, then
14 the maximum has many of the features of a f ixed uniform

15 price, and since it is always in the power of the
16

combination to raise the price, the so-call ed maximum is not

17 a maximum at all, because it can be hiked a t will by the
18
19

doctors themselves, as this record clearly shows.
Moreover, this Court has never su ggested that a

20 professed goal of having reasonable prices is an excuse for
21 price agreements among competitors.
22

QUESTION:

Do you think Arizona's primary

23 complaint here is the predatory nature of t he agreement or
24 the keeping out of other doctors?
25

MR. SHAPIRO:

Arizona’s point is that the

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 agreement could be used to keep out other doctors through
2 depression of the price, and it could be used to inflate the
3 cost of health insurance through elevating the costs.

It is

4 the aggregation of power through the combination to do those
5 two things that is illegal.
6

QUESTION':

But don't you need to know something

7 about the market?
8

MS. SHAPIRO:

You do not.

That is precisely what

9 you don’t need to know in a case of naked price fixing, as
10 this Court held in Socony and in Trenton Potteries, and many
11 of its other decisions.

12

QUESTION:

You used the phrase "could be used".

13

HR. SHAPISO:

It is the potential, as the Court

14 pointed out in Trenton Potteries.

It is the aggregation of

15 power to -- which could be pressed to improper ends that
16 Section 1 of the Sherman Act condemns as illeaal per se.
17 The aggregation of power in a price fixing combination.

18

This Court's -- Let me illustrate the point that I

19 was making a moment ago.

If the foundations were permitted

20 to enforce their own conception of a reasonable maximum
21 price, there would be an inevitable tendency to adjust that

22 price upwards *to promote their own economic welfare, and as
23 this Court emphasized in

the Socony case, those who fixed

24 reasonable prices today would fix unreasonable prices
25 tomorrow, and any insurance company that wished to do

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 business with the combination

would be compelled to pay up

2 to the fixed maximum price.
3

I would also point out in this connection that

4 although the foundation’s claim that a maximum price is
5 essential to contain medical costs, they fail to suggest a
6 single reason why that maximum price needs to be prescribed
7 by a combination of competitors.

If in fact a maximum price

8 is a useful feature in medical insurance plans,

the maximum

9 can be prescribed by individual insurers who pay for the
10 medical services and who actually have an incentive to

11 reduce medical expenditures.

That is the way the Blue

12 Shield insurance policies operate throughout this country.

13

The present price fixing scheme prevents

14 individual insurers from obtaining competitively negotiated
15 agreements with individual doctors, and interferes with
16 their efforts to contain medical costs.

That is bad for the

17 consumers, who pay for the insurance premiums.
18

In short, this price fixing scheme poses a serious

19 threat to competitive

conditions.

It can be enjoined

20 without causing injury to any joint productive activity.

In

21 these circumstances, we submit, the per se rule is properly
22 applied,

and it is properly applied on the record which is

23 now before this Court.

As this Court pointed out in the

24 White Motors case some time ago, it is perfectly appropriate
25 to use summary judgment procedures in a horizontal price

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 fixing casa, and it referred to the Kiefer-Stewart decision,
2 which is a maximum price fixing case, in making that
3 observation.
4

For these reasons, we respectfully submit that the

5 decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.
6

QUESTION;

Mr. Shapiro, may I ask you one

7 question, if you are through?

You said there are two

8 components of this agreement, one an agreement on what the
9 schedule shall be, and secondly, each doctor agrees net to
10 charge his customers more than the schedule, as T understand
11 it,

insured, where there is insurance, and you said Blue

12 Shield is different in

that Blue Shield specifies the

13 schedule.
14

Would the Blue Shield program be illegal if Blue

15 Shield specified the schedule and if every doctor that
16 participated in the program agreed not to charge in excess
17 of the schedule?

18

MR. SHAPIRO;

19 position has been

The Justice Department's consistent

that if individual doctors sign up

20 individually on the dotted line, which is the procedure, it
21 is perfectly all right.

But if the doctors combine together

22 and use their .concerted power to negotiate with the
23 individual insurer to establish that price,
24 per se.

that is illegal

That is what our business review letters have said

25 for the past decade.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP P. BEE ELSON, ESQ.,

4
5

Ur. Berelson.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BERELSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court, this is a summary judgment case, and
7 because of that I am going to spend a great deal of time
8 talking about the facts and the lack of facts that are
9 undisputed and are in the record.
10

First, I would point out that Respondents have

11 submitted a statement of material facts in issue pr ecludin
12 summary judgment.

It is found in the appendix, at Page 12

13 and I think it deals with many of the issues which I am
14 going to discuss.
15

Most important, there is no fee schedule, no fee

16 schedule as Petitioner and as the United States have used
17 that term today.

The evidence shows that there is no

18 agreement concerning what doctors charge patients, and the
19 District Court so ruled, and that is right in its opinion.

20

What the Petitioner is calling a fee schedule is

21 really an agreement by members of a medical foundation which

22 only affects medical foundation endorsed insurance, and it
23 is an agreement to accept the maximum reimbursement levels
24 as payment in full in the event that the doctor bills the
25 patient more than that maximum reimbursement level and

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

the

1 patient is medical foundation insured.

Then the doctor will

2 write off the difference.
3

If the doctor is not a member of the foundation,

4 then the doctor is free to charge the difference to the
5 patient.
6

This is accompanied by agreements by the members

7 of the foundation to be bound by peer review, not to use the
8 foundation to change the rates they bill their patients, not
9 to discriminate in billing between foundation insured and
10 non-insured patients, and it has absolutely no effect
11 whatsoever without the additional component of an insurer

12 voluntarily agreeing to participate in the program, and
13 there is no evidence in the record that there is any ability
14 to coerce insurers to participate.

Indeed, the record is

15 absolutely empty as to what the insurers really do in the
16 market.
All we can say, and this is very limited, is that

17
18 in

1979 Maricopa Foundation, one of the Respondents, insured

19 about

1,000 people out of a population of 1.5 million in
m

20 Maricopa County, about 7 percent, and in 1978, Fima
21 Foundation covered about 6,000 people, or about 1 percent of
22 the population of Pima County, and in that same year, only
23 31 percent of the physicians in
24 Pima Foundation.

MS. BERELSON;

That is right.

If you look, at the

3 complaint/ there are allegations about an overall conspiracy

Well, did the Court of Appeals hold

7 that the per se rule was not to be applied?
8

MR. 3ERELS0N;

9

QUESTION;

At this stage —

Did it say on a remand that perhaps the

10 evidence would show that a per se rule should be applied
11 rather than rule of reason?
12

MR. BERELSON :

I believe the Court of Appeals

13 decision left that open.

It is possible.

Do you leave it open?

Would you say

MR. BERELSON:

But if we assume that the

10 Petitioner's facts were correct, then after you had the full
11 evidentiary hearing and were able to determine whether the

12 facts that we are putting forth are indeed the correct facts
13 or not the correct facts, the Court may disagree with us,
14 and it may say this is a per se violation.

We don’t think

15 that will happen on the facts as they are developed.

That’s right.

There is no evidence

QUESTION:

16

—
That is something you would rely on if

were trying the case on the merits, isn't it?
MR. BERELSON:

That is right, but what I am trying

17 to demonstrate to the Court is that what the Petitioner
18

19

claims are undisputed facts are not facts at all.
QUESTION:

Are you also suggesting that in any

20 event this negates the idea of applying a per se rule?
21

MR. BERELSON:

What we are saying is that unless

22 the Petitioner, can demonstrate an effect on price in the
23 marketplace which it has chosen, that there can't be a per
24 se violation.
25

They have failed to do that.

QUESTION:

MR. BERELSONi

15 1971 in

Over a period of how many years?
Since -- I believe that is from

the case of the Maricopa Foundation, but I may be

16 wrong on that year.

The Appendix C to our brief shows the

17 amount of the increases in the reimbursement levels of the
18 Maricopa Foundation, and he compares it against published
19 statistics on the rate of increase of medical fees in

20 Maricopa County and nationwide, and shows that the rate is
21 less for the maximum reimbursement levels, and

that is

22 consistent with the contention that we intend to prove at
23 trial that the medical foundation is a mechanism for holding
24 down costs, and it is the cost to the insurer of providing
25 the medical care that the insurer has contracted to

I would like to explain how that works.

You have

7 want?

You have the patients.

What does the patient

A patient wants a commitment from his insurer to pay

8 the medical bills.

The patient does not want to have to pay

9 a difference between what the insurance covers and what the
10 doctor bills.

He wants the insurance to cover the medical

11 procedures which

are necessary, not to be told that he can't

12 have the procedure because he can’t afford it and it is not
13 covered.
He wants the best quality of care.

He wants to

And he wants the

16 insurance cost to be as low as possible, consistent with

QUESTION;

Right.

5

MR. 3ERELS0N ;

6

QUESTION:

And the record shows that --

But limiting it to patients who have

7 the insurance and doctors who are members of the foundation,
8 is it clear on this record that there is an agreement
9 establishing the maximum which the patients must pay?
10

MR. BERELSON:

No, it is an agreement establishing

11 that the patient pays nothing,

12

QUESTION:

the insurer pays --

Well, right,

but themaximum the

13 insurance company will pay —

14

MS. BERELSON:

15

QUESTION:

-- which in turn

allows

itto charge a

16 lower insurance rate, presumably.

17

MR. BERELSON:

Exactly.

The maximum the insurer

18 has to pay -19

QUESTION:

So it is clear on the record that there

20 is an agreement to fix the maximum fees that the doctors
21 will receive for the services performed for this particular

22 segment of the market.
23

MR. BERELSON:

No, because it's an agreement to

24 make a proposal to insurance companies,
25 to accept or reject.

which they are free

It doesn't fix anything.

1

QUESTION;

Yes, but once the insurance — it is a

2 tripartite thing.
3

MR. EERELSON*

4

QUESTION;

That's right.

Once the insurance companies have

5 accepted, and I think four of them have, there is then in
6 effect an agreement among the doctors that in this
7 particular segment of their work they will receive a maximum
8 of so many dollars for such and such a service.
9

MR. BERELSON;

Exactly, and it is an interesting

10 fact that the doctor does not know, because he doesn’t have
11 circulated to him a listing in advance as to what those are

12 going to be.

He is supposed to charge all his patients the

13 way he ordinarily charges them, and when the patient happens
14 to be foundation insured, the foundation will pay the claim,
15 and if the bill was more than what the maximum reimbursement
16 level is, the doctor is informed of this, and then he has to
17 write off the difference.

18

Now, let’s look at what the insurer would like.

19 The insurer would like to keep down the cost of the medical

20 care that it is obligated to indemnify the patient for.
21 That means minimizing the payments for the treatment that
22 must be given, avoiding unnecessary treatment, and the
23 insurer can also lower the cost by limiting the extent of
24 the coverage of the insurance, by excluding coverage of

25 certain procedures or certain types of illnesses.

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The insurer would like to accurately predict the

2 costs of medical care because that
3 make

enables the insurer to

better actuarial predictions, which means that it

can

4 lower its rates because it doesn't have to have a reserve to
5 cover the unexpected, and it is worth pointing out that a
6 big element in that unexpected is usually inflation, and the
7 possibility of increases in the costs of medical services

particular procedure is going to be a year from now in

12

The insurer needs a mechanism to negotiate cost

13 containment.

He needs one which is inexpensive and

14 administratively feasible.

He cannot go out and send his

15 agents to negotiate individually with every one of the

16 doctors in the community.

In the record we see a number of

17 1,700 in Maricopa County , and keep in mind that you are
18 talking about a n umber of insurers who do business in
19 Maricopa County, although the number is not defined in the
20 record.
21

Bu t if we assume that it i s even 50, if you have

22 50 insurers each trying to negotiate with

1,700 doctors, you

23 can see the administrative nightmare that you get.

MR. BERELSON:

The same thing happens

What happens here is, the medical

18 foundation offers the doctor the opportunity to either

a study performed by Nr. William Link

Now, we have

the Journal of Law and Economics, and

of that study is that the empirical

5 evidence and the theory behind it demonstrates that when

6 members of the medical profession perform this function of
7 proposing a

maximum reimbursement level, empirically, the

8 result is that you get a lower level, and you get more
9 doctors agreeing to accept it as payment in full.
10

That is the evidence that we would put in at trial

11 to demonstrate that this is a pro-competitive cost
12 containment device, and that there is no effect on the fee
13 that the patient pays.

There is an effect in that the cost

14 of the insurance that he buys may be lower, and

The rate which has
Eut the important

14 thing to remember is that the insurer does not have to
15 accept that proposal.

If the insurer can do better on its

16 own , if the insurer can negotiate with doctors a lower

17 reimbursement rate, there is nothing to stop it from doing
18 that.
19

What I am suggesting to you is that as a empirical

20 matter, which we can prove at trial, if given the
21 opportunity, they are not going to get in the marketplace a

22 better deal than they will get with the medical foundation.

QUESTION;

Doesn't that all boil down to the

24 question that — the question that is presented is whether
25 it is unlawful for a group that is not shown to be a

2 would it be a defense for them to show that those prices are
3 lower than the free market?
4

MR. BEBELSOKi

"So, that is not what it is at all,

5 because they haven't agreed on a price.

They have agreed on

6 a proposal that anybody can accept or reject, and if it is
7 rejected, it is not the price.

The price is what they would

8 ordinarily charge.
9

QUESTION;

Yes, but the record shows that it has

10 not been rejected, it has been accepted.
11

MR. BERELSONi

So, it has been rejected, because

12 only 7 percent of the people in Maricopa County are insured
13 under this.
14

The other 93 have rejected it.

QUESTION:

Do those 7 percent of the people -- the

15 rates of those people are enough

to account for $1.8 million

16 a year, the bond premium?
17

MR. BERELSONi

No, no, that number just has

18 nothing to do with what we are talking about here.

The

19 number that is important is that for the people who have
20 been insured, the foundation can show for Maricopa County a
21 saving of $8 million compared to what the medical fees would

22 have been.

QUESTION:

How many people are involved, if there

1

QUESTION;

yes.

2

MR. BERELSONi

The difference in that situation

3 is, the patient never knows in advance whether what the
4 insurance pays will cover what the doctor bills.

If he is a

5 member of a foundation plan, and if the doctor is a
6 foundation doctor,

then he knows in advance that whatever it

7 costs, the foundation insurance will pay the entire bill,
8 and he doesn't have to worry about the difference.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I don't see why this arrangement

10 has anything to do with insurance rates.

It has got to do

11 with whether patients have some limit tc their medical bills,

12

MR. BERELSONi

That is the benefit from the point

13 of view of the patient, and that is why doctors who are
14 engaged in independent practices have an incentive to join a
15 medical foundation, because this enables them to offer
16 something to the patient which looks to the patient like an
17 HMO.

An HMO dees the same thing in the sense that for a

18 fixed amount of money paid for HMO, you get all the medical
19 care that you need.

20

A doctor in private practice couldn't do that by

21 him self.

22

QUESTION;

Is there any — I asked before, but I

23 take it that it is correct that there is nothing in the
24 record to indicate what the position of the non-member
25 doctors in the community is with respect to this arrangement.

14

It doesn't make any sense.

QUESTION:

Isn’t the reason, one of the reasons

15 for their objection the feeling that if your organization
16 were not in business, more HKOs would be in business?
17

HR. BERELSON:

If that is their position, there is

18 nothing in the record to support it, and it is not the basis
19 for summary judgment.

Yes, that may well be what they

20 ultimately intend to show.

MR. BERELSONi

1

Well, but the record does show that

2 when the fostered chosen care plan for Arizona went from the
3 Maricopa Foundation reimbursement schedule to a different
4 one, the state paid more money for the same medical
5 services.

6 at all.

Why did they do that?

I submit it makes no sense

They did it because they thought that what Maricopa

7 Foundation was doing was not legal, and therefore they
8 didn't want to participate in it.

9

But what we would like is an opportunity to show

10 that it is legal, it saves costs of insurance, it lowers
11 insurance costs.

The market forces control what the maximum

12 reimbursement rates can be.

If the rates get too high,

13 insurers will not write Maricopa Foundation or any medical
14 foundation insurance.

They will set their own reimbursement

15 levels that are lower.
16

If the rates are too low, the doctors just won’t

QUESTION;

8

MR. BERELSON;

There is a pendent state claim

There is a pendent state claim
In the federal action, which was

9 not the basis for the summary judgment motion which you have
10 before you today, but it is there.

The state law is the

11 Uniform State Antitrust Law, which is very similar to the
12 Sherman

Act.

Indeed, it says that you look at the Sherman

13 Act precedents.
14

In the opposition to the summary judgment motion,

15 the medical foundations have argued that the maximum
16 reimbursement levels are essential to the concept and

17 operation of medical foundation endorsed insurance.

We

18 should be given an opportunity to produce the evidence and
19 present it at a hearing to determine that.
20

The situation is very similar to the type of

21 activity that the Court sanctioned in the Broadcast Music
22 case.

You have the creation of a new product, different

23 from what any individual doctor could offer by himself.
24 What happens is, you get full coverage insurance, which pays
25 medical costs in full, and a peer review to avoid

62

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 unnecessary procedures.

The medical foundation dees put the

2 doctor at risk, and the evidence cf that is in the appendix
3 at Page 309.
4

The doctor is not compensated for any additional

5 complexity or difficulty in treatment.

If he would charge

6 more than the maximum reimbursement level because of
7 complexity or difficulty, it is too bad, if he is dealing
8 with a Maricopa Foundation patient and he is a Maricopa
9 Foundation member.

He has to write it off.

If he performs

10 a treatment which he in good faith believes is medically
11 necessary, and peer review of the medical foundation

12 disagrees with him, he is at risk for that.

He has to write

13 it off and accept their judgment.
14

If the costs of medical services that he must buy,

15 if his costs of supplies and help

or

18 kept the rates down, and that you have done a wonderful job
19 for the people of

20 legal issues there?
21

MB. BERELSON:

Well, the legal issue is whether

22 you are going .to characterize that as price fixing, and what
23 I am suggesting to you is that the evidence that is in

this

24 record does not enable you to make that characterization.

4

MR. 3ERELS0N;

Because we are talking about

We are talking about

6 a comparison between what doctors bill patients and what
7 insurers pay for the services that they have agreed to
8 provide to their insureds.
9

QUESTION;

I understand all that, but I just don't

10 understand how any of the things you have described are
11 relevant to the legal issue.

12

MR. BERELSON;

They are relevant because they show

13 that —
14

QUESTION;

We have to decide, A, is this a price

15 fixina agreement, and B, if it is, it is obviously maximum
16 rather than minimum, although I know there is an argument to

18 and if it is a maximum price fixing agreement, is it
19 unlawful.

Do you think that a district judge has

5 discretion in the timing of his decision as tc whether to
6 grant or deny a motion for partial summary judgment?

NR. BERELSON:

I think a district judge does, but

8 that the discretion has to take into account the experience
9 and the theory and whether the precedents which deal with
10 per se liability on price fixing are applicable and
11 appropriate in this particular type of marketplace on the

12 particular facts that are set forth.

In this case, the district court, if he has
