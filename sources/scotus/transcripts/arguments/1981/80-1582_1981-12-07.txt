ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

ON BEHAL OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOROWITZ;

9 certiorari to the United
10 Fourth Circuit.

one which I will devote most of my attention to in

13 to a

period when a person is under no form of restraint and

14 has no charges pending against him.

There are also two subsidiary questions presented

15
16 here.

First, if the Court rejects the government’s view

17 that the speedy trial clause is not applicable to such

a

18 period, it is our contention nevertheless that the
19 application of the Barker v.

Wingo factors in this case

20 demonstrates that there was no Sixth

Amendment violation

21 here.
22

Second, Respondent contends as an alternative

23 ground for

affirmance that in any event the pre-indictment

24 delay here

violated the due process clause.

25

The background of this litigation is as follows.

to dismiss the

indictment, including motions to dismiss on speedy trial and

double jeopardy grounds.

When the district court denied

4 these motions. Respondent took a pretrial appeal to the

In

1978,

this Court vacated the Fourth Circuit's

decision on the ground that the denial of a motion to

9 dismiss on speedy trial grounds could not be appealed before
10

a trial.

On remand, the Fourth Circuit rejected

11 Respondent’s double jeopardy claim, and this Court denied
12

certiorari.

The case was then remanded to the district

13 court for trial.
14

After the district court denied a pretrial speedy

15 trial motion, and the court of appeals denied a petition for
16 writ of mandamus, Respondent's trial commenced in July of

Bail was denied at one time, wasn't it?
At one time, yes, but in light of

11 changed the bail conditions and allowed him out on bail.
12

QUESTION:

Did Judge DuPree make any finding as to

13 whether there was prejudice as a result of the delay?
14

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, Judge DuPree wrote an opinion

15 which is reprinted in the appendix to the petition.

I

16 believe it is Pages 56 to 63 that are relevant, and he found
17 that he had been carefully watching during the trial for any
18 signs of prejudice, and that there was no prejudice at all
19 as a result of the delay.
20

I should note that the court of appeals opinion

21 found that the primary part of the delay that it considered
22 ground for dismissal of the indictment was the two-year
23 period between the submission of the CID report to the
24 Justice Department and the convening of the grand jury.
25

How, the critical period here for this Court's

1 attention is the period between the dismissal of the
2 military charges in October, 1970, and the return of the
3 indictment in January of 1975.

That is the period over

4 which the parties are in dispute.
5

Respondent's contention is that his speedy trial

6 right attached during this period, one during which no
7 charges were pending against him.

That conclusion, we

8 submit, is at odds both with the language of the Sixth
9 Amendment and with the policies underlying the speedy trial
10 clause.
11

The Sixth Amendment provides,

"In all criminal

12 prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
13 trial."

And it then goes on to enumerate several other

14 protections that an accused is entitled to in the course of
15 cri minal pr osecutions •

Indeed, the right makes no sense in this context,

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Nr. Horowitz, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - RESUMED

6

MR. HOROWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

7 may it please the Court, as I mentioned before the break, we
8 believe that the speedy trial clause is not applicable to

9 this period by its express terms, because Respondent was not
10

11
12

accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.
This is quite clear from this Court's decision in
Marion, because Respondent was not accused within the

13 meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

This is quite clear from

14 this Court's decision in Marion, where the Court
15 specifically focused on the question of when a person
16 becomes an accused such that a Sixth Amendment speedy trial
17 right attaches.
18

The Court explained at Page 320 of its opinion in

19 Marion, and I quote, "It is either a formal indictment or
20 information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest
21

and holding to answer a criminal charge that engaged this

22 protection."

23

Here, the government agrees that Respondent's

24 Sixth Amendment right did attach when he was held to answer
25 a criminal charge filed under Article 30 of the Code of

1

Military Justice, but the government's Cons titutional

2

obligation was completely satisfied, and th e pendency of

3

this speedy trial right was necessary extin guished by the

4

speedy dismissal of that charge and Respond ent's release

5

from all restraints on his liberty.
QUESTION;

6

If the government was completely free,

7

why did they make this long report to the D epartment of

8

Justice?
MR. HOROWITZ*

9

Well, the governme nt was freed of

10

its obligation under the speedy trial claus e, but that

11

doesn't mean that it was freed of its oblig ation to try to

crime, they were considering prosecution.
QUESTION*

20

Mr. Horowitz, there is some comment in

21

the briefs about a change in the testimony of two

22

witnesses.

23

Do you have any comment on that ?
MR. HOROWITZ*

Well, I think we h ave explained in

24

our reply brief that, first of all, the one witness really

25

didn't change his testimony, and explained why his medical

1 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 opinion had changed; the second witness explained why she
2 could not recall what she had been asked about when she was
3 first interviewed, and then later did recall in 1975.
4 Neither one of these has anything to do with delay.
First of all, the speedy trial clause really

5

6 doesn’t protect the defendant against the strengthening of
7 the government's case.

What it

protects him against is

8 prejudice to his defense because of the passage of time.
9

When the charges against Respondent were

10 dismissed, the criminal prosecution was terminated, and
11 there was no charge left to which a speedy trial claim could
12 attach.
13

Now, Respondent argues that his case is markedly

14 similar to that of Klopfer versus North Carolina, and I
15

think it is instructive to address this contention, because

16

in our view it is the differences between this case, the

17 situation of a defendant against whom no charges are
18 pending, and the situation of the defendant in Klopfer that
19 are significant for Sixth Amendment purposes.

20

Under the state procedure used in Klopfer, the

21 defendant was subjected to an unliquidated criminal charge
22 for an indefinite period of time.

The state simply took a

23 pause in its prosecution of the defendant, a pause that
24 could have lasted indefinitely, and it was free to pick up
25 the prosecution again at any time right where it left off,

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 simply by calling the case for trial.
2

Moreover, the statute of limitations was tolled

3 during this period,

and thus it was effectively eliminated

4 as a protection for the defendant.
5

Here, by contrast, the government could try

6 Respondent only by beginning a prosecution from scratch,
7 that is, by convening a grand jury, convincing the grand
8 jury to return an indictment, and all of this would have to

9 be done within the statute of limitations.

Indeed, the

10 Court’s opinion in Klopfer indicates that a speedy dismissal

11 of the charges against an accused satisfies the Sixth
12 Amendment right just as surely as if he is given a speedy

13 trial.

The Court there noted at Page 216 of its opinion, in

14 discussing the North Carolina procedure, that the procedure
15 provided no means for the defendant to obtain either a
16 dismissal or a trial.
17

Now, the policies underlying the speedy trial

18 protection similarly have no applicability to a period when
19 no charges are pending.

20

QUESTION:

In Marion --

Mr. Horowizt, in this case, as I

21 understand it, the district court found there was no
22 prejudice to the defendant by virtue of the delay.

Had

23 there been a finding of prejudice, would you then feel that
24 the speedy trial clause was still inapplicable, or would you
25 reach relief under the due process clause?

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. HOROWITZ;

1

Well, in our view, the first

2 question is whether the speedy trial clause is applicable.
3 If the speedy trial clause is applicable to a period, then
4 you look at the Barker v. Wingo factors, and one of those
5 factors is prejudice.

QUESTION;

MR. HOROWITZ;

That's correct.

10 have his Fifth Amendment argument.

He would still

The Sixth Amendment

11 doesn't apply.
12

In Marion, this Court discussed the policies that

13 are the subject of a Sixth Amendment protection.

A formal

14 charge brought by the state is a public accusation that the
15 government has probable cause to believe that the accused
16

has committed a crime.

This public accusation entails

17

certain adverse consequences to the accused , and I would

18 like to examine those adverse consequences as listed by this
1 g Court at Page 320 of its opinion in Marion, and that is
20 reprinted in our brief at Page 20.
21

In our view, it is clear that these consequences

22 are dispelled by the dismissal of the charge, just as surely
23 as they would be dispelled if the accused had been brought
24 to a speedy trial on those charges.

Hence a dismissal must

25 terminate the applicability of the Sixth Amendment guarantee.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The first interest identified by the Court is that

2 the public accusation seriously interferes with
3 defendant’s liberty.

the

This is perhaps the most important

4 interest protected, because it is the one that is unique to
5 the speedy trial context.
6 defendant is under

some restriction on his liberty.

7 he is not incarcerated,

Even if

he would probably be released under

8 certain conditions of bail.
9

Of course, in this case, this interest is not

10 applicable at all,

because defendant was completely released

11 when the military charges were dismissed

against him and he

12 was honorably discharged from the Army.

He had no

13 restrictions whatsoever on his liberty.
14

Another interest identified by this Court --

speedy trial right -QUESTION;

2

Yes, but many cases are

3

distinguishable, because here he had been charged, and the

4

charges were dismissed.

5

MR. HOROWITZ;

6

The public obliquy to which he was subjected, we

That’s true.

7

submit, was dispelled by the equally public exoneration that

8

he received, that is, the dismissal of the charges and his

9

honorable discharge.

This put him in the same position as

10

if he had been tried and acquitted.

11

purposes of the public obliquy interest, he was in a better

12

position because there had not even been a finding of

13

probable cause against him, whereas had he been acquitted,

14

the public could reasonably presume that there had been

15

probable cause to charge him with the crime.
QUESTION;

16

Indeed, he was -- for

You don't really mean he is in a better

17

position than if he had been acquitted, do you?

18

been acquitted, that would have been the end of the case.
MR. HOROWITZ;

19

If he had

That's right, but that is only

20

because he would have been put in jeopardy, and he could

21

have been -- another prosecution couldn’t have been brought

22

23

24

clause doesn’t give him the right to jeopardy, to double

25

jeopardy.

The speedy trial

Obviously, he would have preferred to be

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

acquitted, but as far as these specific interests that the

2

Court has identified in connection with the speedy trial

3

clause, I don't think the public obliguy to which he was

4

subjected after his dismissal was any worse than if he had

5

been acquitted.

6

QUESTION;

Isn't there some analogy to the Bartkus

7

against Illinois, the dual sovereignty concept of jeopardy

8

that even though a state may try and acquit, the federal

9

government may still prosecute?

10

MR. HOROWITZ;

11

QUESTION;

Yes, well --

Certainly the defendant after he has

12

been acquitted by the state may well learn that the federal

13

government is still investigating.

14

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, the rule is that the double

15

jeopardy clause doesn't protect against a second prosecution

16

brought by the federal government after by the state.

17

in this situation it is considered to be a single sovereign,

18

so if he had in fact been tried by the military --

19

20
21

QUESTION;

Now,

Well, I realize that, but I mean, as to

the factual matter of anxiety and so forth.
MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, as to the factual matter of

22

anxiety, I think the only thing that is fair to say is that

23

he is in the same position as a person who has been --

24

excuse me, as a person who is under investigation, and knows

25

that he is under investigation.

Now, that creates --

QUESTION;

Or, as Justice Rehnquist suggests, a

2 fellow who has been indicted by the state.
MR. HOROWITZ;

3

4 indicted by the state.
5

QUESTION;

6

MR. HOROWITZ;

Yes, or someone who has been
Now --

Or even convicted by the state.
There is, of course, an additional

7 anxiety once he is subject to a pending indictment.

That is

8 the anxiety that the speedy trial clause protects against,
9 and that is the anxiety that has been dispelled by his
10 public, by the dismissal of the charges.

The lingering

11 anxiety that he still has over the possibility that he may
12 still be prosecuted is no different than what the defendant
13 in Marion had.
14

I think, just as the policies underlying the speedy

15 trial clause militate against Respondent's position, so,
16

too, do considerations of the sound administration of

17

justice.

18

important reasons for permitting the prosecutor to exercise

As this Court explained in Lovasco, there are

19 his discretion as to whether and when to institute criminal
20 charges.

These considerations are equally applicable if the

21 charge has already been filed and dismissed, and as we
22 explained in our brief, there are many legitimate reasons
23 for a prosecutor deciding to dismiss a charge that has
24 already been filed.
25

Now, the filing of a criminal charge against a

1 defendant, particularly for murder, is a decision not to be
2 made lightly or hastily.

As this Court stated in Lovasco,

3 the fact that a prosecutor takes a long

time and carefully

4 considers whether to bring such a charge is an exercise of
5 principles of fair play and decency, not in opposition to
6 those principles.

The administration of justice is advanced if a

7

8 prosecutor is free to exercise his discrection without the

9 threat of the severe sanction of dismissal of the indictment
10 for all time hanging over his head if he does not act with

11 what a court with the benefit of hindsight later determines
12 to be sufficient

Now,

expedition.

the Respondent has suggested in this case, at

19 of his brief, that he does not necessarily insist

15 that there be a general rule applying the speedy trial
16 clause to a period after dismissal, but he does contend that
17 the protection should apply

18 case.
19 special

to this period in his special

He does not really explain what factors justify a
exception for him, and indeed, we contend that

20 whatever special aspects there are to this case argue even
21 more forcefully against applying the speedy trial clause

22 here.
23

First, the charges were brought by a different

24 prosecuting authority, by the military, so there is not the
25 same specter of the same prosecutor making a mistake,

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 bringing charges, and then dismissing them.
2 never indicted at all.

Second, he was

And third, and perhaps most

3 important is the extraordinary severity of the crime
4 involved here, which should argue against a special
5 exception for speedy trial purposes.
6

I would like to emphasize, however, that it is

7 important that there be a general rule on which prosecutors
8 can rely in this area.

Prosecutors are entitled to know

9 when making the charging decision whether the speedy trial
10 time is running against them.

They should not have to be

11 exposed to the possibility that a court will later decide
12 that a particular case calls for an exception, and a sort of
13 retrospective application of the speedy trial clause to a
14 period where the prosecutor would not have expected the time
15 to be running.
16

This general rule, we suggest, is a simple one.

17 It is the one that was stated by this Court at Page 313 of
18 its opinion in Marion.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees a

19 person who is subject to a public accusation the right to a
20 speedy disposition of the charges pending against him, no
21 more.
22

Now, this case has a narrow focus, and that is the

23 applicability of the speedy trial clause.

Of course, we

24 recognize that a person has legitimate interests concerning
25 the possibility of prosecution even when no charges are

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

pending against him.

But o ur system of justice provides

2

other protections for those interests, not the speedy trial

3

clause.
For example, a pe rson has an interest in repose

4
5

against the possibility tha t charges will eventually be

6

brought against him, or tha t stale charges will be brought.

7

The statute of limitations, as this Court has said many

8

times, is the protection fo r that interest.

9

He also is entitl ed to protection against unfair

10

pre-indictment delay or gov eminent misconduct, but the due

11

process clause protects him against that.

12

he is entitled to protectio n against a second prosecution

13

once a first prosecution ha s advanced to a certain stage,

14

but the double jeopardy cla use is the source of that

15

protection.

And, of course,

These protections are adequate to serve their

16
17

purposees, and there is no need to supplement them here by

18

wrenching the Sixth Amendme nt from its proper context to

19

apply to a situation when n o charges are pending against the

20

accused.

21

I would like to t urn briefly, if I could, to the

22

subsidiary questions that a re raised by this case.

On

23

Respondent's contention tha t he is entitled to a dismissal

24

under the Fifth Amendment, we think this contention is

25

insubstantial.

There is cl early, by Respondent’s own

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

admission in this case, no intentional or unfair government

2

delay in this case, and therefore there can be no Fifth

3 Amendment violation.
4
5
6

Moreover, as discussed in our brief, there was no
actual prejudice to the accused’s defense at trial.
With respect to the Sixth Amendment question,

7 which this Court need reach only if it rejects the
8 government's primary contention that the speedy trial clause
9

does not apply to this period, we suggest that the delay

10

between the dismissal of the charges and the return of the

11

indictment was justifiable, and should not be held against

12

the government.

13

It must be remembered that this was an

14

extraordinarily complex case that required detailed analysis

15

of the evidence.

16

that there was no undue delay in the preparation and

17

submission of the CID report up until 1972, and it took the

18

Justice Department time to digest the material in this

19

report and to decide whether a case could be made against

20

the Respondent.

21
22

The court of appeals itself recognized

Moreover, a murder charge is a very serious
matter, and it was the government's position, as it should

23 be, that it did not want to charge the Respondent with the
24
25

murders unless it felt it could obtain a conviction.
There were certain -- There were obviously certain

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 factors which Respondent has pointed to in his brief that
2 made it at least questionable whether a conviction could be
3 obtained in this case.

They had to worry about the decision

4 made by the Article 32 hearing already, which had held there
5 was insufficient evidence to convene a court martial, and
6 the fact that the case was essentially circumstantial, and
7 that there was no obvious motive.
8

Finally, I should point out that, contrary to

9 Respondent's suggestion, this careful consideration and time
10 that the department gave to the case was not in -- excuse
11 me, was not in opposition to the desires that they expressed
12 for a prompt resolution of the case.
13
14

Now, there are letters that Respondent's counsel
sent to the Department of Justice asking about the case,

15 asking about its status, asking that it be dismissed because
16

of his innocence, and wondering what was happening.

17

QUESTION;

Do you mean before the indictment?

18

MR. HOROWITZ;

19

QUESTION;

Right.

Then that wouldn't be a matter of

20 dismissing the charges -21

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. HOROWITZ;

-- but abandoning them.
I am sorry.

That the investigation

24 be terminated, and that the department abandon its efforts
25 to establish a case against him.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Sow, Respondent's counsel did not ask that the

1

2 government go forward promptly and indict him.

Rather, they

3 asked that it give careful consideration to all the factors
4 before deciding to proceed with an indictment, and
5 unfortunately, these letters were in the record.

They are

6 not reprinted in the joint appendix in this appeal.

They

7 were reprinted in the joint appendix in this Court in
8 MacDonald One, and I would like to read one portion from
9 Page 94 of that joint appendix.
10
11

This was written by Mr. Malley, Respondent's
counsel, to Mr. Snead, the Deputy Attorney General, and he

12 asks the department, "...if at all possible to take whatever
13

steps you feel appropriate to ensure that Dr. MacDonald's

14

case is carefully evaluated."
This letter was written in April of 1973, which

15
16

was already into the time period that the court of appeals

17

suggested the government should already have indicted him.

18

The court of appeals' suggestion essentially is that as soon

19

as the government got this report, it should have run in,

20 convened a grand jury, and indicted him, but here you have,
21

in the middle of this period, Respondent is still asking for

22

careful consideration by the government before reaching such

23

a decision.
Another factor in the Barker analysis is the

24
25

prejudice.

I think the prejudice to the defense is

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 adequately discussed in the briefs.

I would just like to

2 point out that there is no support in the record for
3 Respondent's assertion that publicity and expense to which

4 he was subjected continued unabated.
5

Now, I think it is important to step back and

6 consider what the Court of Appeals has done here.

A man has

7 been convicted of a brutal crime, the murder of his wife and
8 two children, after what this Court must assume to have been
9 a fair trial.

Nevertheless, he has been set free forever,

10 never to answer for that crime.

This has been done because

11 the government took great care and time to consider his case
12 before deciding to charge him, and an appel late court has
13 determined with hindsight that the decision could have been

14 reached in less time.
15

The Sixth Amendment does not require such a

16 miscarriage of justice.
17

I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

18

QUESTION;

Mr. Horowitz, the court of appeals did

19 not reach the due process argument.
20

MR. HOROWITZ;

Is that right?

That's correct.

The Respondent has

21 raised it, and I think it is properly before the Court.
22

QUESTION;

Well, if the Court were to agree with

23 you on the Sixth Amendment claim, then what should this
24 Court do with the due process argument?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH S. SPRITZER, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. SPRITZER;

Oh, yes.

On remand, yes.
Mr. Spritzer.

Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, as

11 counsel has indicated, the Respondent supports the judgment
12 below on alternative grounds.

First, we support the holding

13 of the court of appeals on two occasions, the occasion of
14 the interlocutory appeal and the present appeal, that the
15 Sixth Amendment guarantee of speedy trial was violated in
16 this case.

17

Alternatively, and independently, we urge that the

18 trial prejudice which was found by the court of appeals

19 after its very full examination of the record warrants a
20 finding that there was a violation of due process as well,
21 though it is quite true that the court of appeals, having
22 decided as it did the Sixth Amendment question, stated that
23 it was not necessary for it to decide the Fifth Amendment
24 isuse.

It did make findings with respect to the issues of

25 trial prejudice.

Yes.

Under the Marion case, the

That triggers, as

the speedy trial provision of the

I think the Court put it that arrest

23 triggers the provision even though there has been no formal
24 indictment, and so our case so far as the Sixth Amendment is
25 concerned rests upon the proposition that there had been an

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

9 that suspicion may attach to somebody who is under

11 formally charged.

who hasn't been

As with many other Constitutional

12 protections, so also, I think, of the Sixth Amendment
13 guarantee of speedy trial,

when a public act is taken by the

14 sovereign, protections that weren’t previously available
15 come into play, and I think Marion makes quite clear, I
16 think

the government doesn't disagree, that the speedy trial

17 provision was activated by the arrest and the restraint.
18 Rather,

it contends that it was deactivated during an

19 interim period between the dismissal of the initial
20 indictment by the military and the re-indictment by the
21 civilian authorities.
22

Now, I should say that the Department of Justice

23 monitored this case from its very beginning.

It was hardly

24 a case of a dual prosecution in any sense.
25

Why shouldn't it be deactivated, Mr.

1 Spritzer?

I suppose you are going to get to that.
MR. SPRITZERS

2

3 point out what the
4 with

Yes, I am.

Let me first, if I may,

findings of the court of appeals were

respect to the four factors in Barker against Wingo.

5

As to the substantiality of the delay, it was a

6 delay of

close to two and one-half years after the

7 investigation and the re-investigation and a sixth month
8 period

to report the result of the investigation had taken

9 place.

As to that two and a half year period, both panels

10 of

the court of appeals found that it was inexcusable, that

11 nothing was taking place, that the department was letting
12 the

case lie on the shelf, that it reflected, in the words

13 of Judge Murnaghan below "a calloused and lackidasical
14 attitude" and was irresponsible.
15

QUESTION:

Counsel, doesn't the Lovasco case

16 permit that kind of a delay, while the state weighs the
17 evidence, or the prosecuting authority?
18

MR. SPRITZER:

Certainly when any legitimate

19 prosecutorial purpose is being served, that would justify
20 delay.

What the court of appeals found is that nothing was

21 being done, and it found that on the basis of evidence that
22 was submitted to it.

The United States Attorney responsible

23 for this case, when asked why this had been delayed more
24 than two years, said, just bureaucracy.
25

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, then, that in every

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 murder case brought by the United States or any prosecution
2 brought by the United States, that the courts are free to
3 weigh the diligence of the government in bringing the case?

MR. SPRITZER;

4

I am suggesting that where a

5 prosecution is initiated and then dismissed, and then there
6 is a continuing investigation in which the same person is

7 the target, and that is accompanied by wide notariety, and
8 he is on notice that he is still an accused person because
9 MacDonald through his counsel was requesting throughout this

10 period that the department make a resolution of the matter,
11 I am saying in those circumstances the interests implicated
12 by the Sixth Amendment continue to play a role --

13

QUESTION;

Then you want a rule just for this

14 case, basically.
15

MR. SPRITZER;

No.

No, I think in any case where

16 there is the triggering of the Sixth Amendment, and where
17 there is a subsequent dismissal of the indictment, and that
18

is followed by an inordinate delay, that the government has

19

the burden of establishing some plausible or legitimate

20 reason for that delay, and the court here found twice over

21 that the government had not been able to do that.
22

QUESTION;

Aren’t you suggesting, in effect, that

23 any time there is an ongoing investigation, the subject of
24 the investigation is a de facto accused under the Fifth
25 Amendment?

Or Sixth Amendment?

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SPRITZER:

No, I am relying on the fact that

I

2 think is a critical fact on the basis of the Marion
3 decision, that here there had been a public accusation,
4 there had been a charge, an arrest and an idictment which
5 was dismissed.

Seven of the federal circuits have

6 considered in speedy trial cases periods that fell between
7 the dismissal of an initial indictment and a re-indictment,
8 and several of those courts of appeals have pointed out that
9 if a prosecutor could avoid all of the requirements of the
10 speedy trial guarantee by the expedient of nol prossing or
11 requesting a dismissal without prejudice, and then
12 re-indicting at leisure, that the interests protected by the
13 speedy guarantee would be thereby defeated.
14

In this case, the court of appeals found that

15 there was an inordinate delay, that there was no
16 justification for it, that the effects of the initial charge
17 continued unabated,

that they caused stress and obliquy, and

18 further, and I mean to develop the question of prejudice,
19 that the long delay resulted in serious impairment of the
20 defendant’s ability to defend against the charges.
21

QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't suggest that there

22 aren't countervailing societal interests in the solution of
23a crime such as this, would you, Mr.
24

MR. SPRITZER:

Spritzer?

Of course, there is a societal

25 interest in the solution of all crimes. Your Honor.

I

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 wouldn’t suggest otherwise.

I do suggest that there is not

2 a societal interest in neglect, in inordinate delay, and
3 that is what the court of appeals found to have taken place
4 here, because that exposes the individual to all the
5 dangers, the pressures and the dangers of impairment of his
6 defense against which the speedy trial guarantee is designed
7 to safeguard one.
8

I wanted to conclude my reference to the Barker

9 against Ringo factors.

I have mentioned the substantiality

10 of the delay, the court’s findings as to reasons for delay.
11 It also found, as I think the Court is aware, that Dr.
12 MacDonald persistently asserted his right to have the matter
13 promptly resolved, and that brings me then to the question
14 of prejudice, and I am going to turn now to the question of
15 prejudice at trial, quite apart from the factors of pretrial
16 prejudice, the matters of stress, anxiety, financial

17 expenditure.
13

Dr. MacDonald’s account of the crime was that his

19 home was invaded by four intruders.

No motives for charging

20 him with this crime have ever been suggested or shown.
21 MacDonald stated that he was first attacked.

Dr.

He in fact was

22 found to have suffered 17 wounds, one that penetrated to the
23 lung.

The government’s theory when it finally brought the

24 case by going to the grand jury almost five years after the
25 crime had occurred was based entirely upon a hypothetical

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reconstruction of the crime.
2

The government produced experts who testified

tha t

3 in various particulars, physical artifacts, laboratory tests
4 showed inconsistencies between Dr. MacDonald's account and
5 their findings.

6

Let me refer the Court --

7

QUESTION*

Has part of that related to the

8 difference in the nature of the wounds on the deceased
9 people and the nature of the wounds on the defendant?
10

MR.

11 Your Honor.
12

SPRITZER*

No, there is no indication of that,

Dr. MacDonald was initially attacked, and --

QUESTION*

Well, there is one ultimate indication,

13 that the three people died of the wounds and one didn’t.
14

MR. SPRITZER*

I thought Your Honor was referring

15 in the nature of the wounds to the kind of instrument that
16 might have been used.
17

QUESTION*

Or whether they could be self-inflicted,

18

MR. SPRITZER*

There was testimony that the wounds

19 that Dr. MacDonald suffered, like those that were true of
20 the wounds suffered by the other members of the family, had
21 been caused by a sharp instrument.
22

Dr. MacDonald's account was that he was severely

23 attacked, whether the intruders, we don't know.

He was

24 rendered unconscious, thought that he had likewise been
25 killed.

We don't know.

Certainly the wound that penetrated

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to the lung was a life-threatening one which raised serious
2 questions as to whether that could have been or would have

3 been self-inflicted.
4

I want to refer the Court, if I may, to the court

5 of appeals finding based upon its full examination of this
6 lengthy record, and it was a six or seven-week trial.

The

7 court found there was almost certain memory erosion on the
8 part of the government's investigators.
9

QUESTION;

Where do we find that, Mr. Spritzer?

10

MR. SPRITZER;

It is in the court of appeals

11 opinion.

Do you want me to locate that, Your Honor?

12

QUESTION;

If you would just give me the page.

13 Unless you don't have it handy.

Now, in a case in which the government's whole

a hypothetical reconstruction, I think a

4 finding that the defendant's ability to test that case
5 effectively by cross examination was rendered virtually

is certainly a finding of severe prejudice which

7 goes to the issue of due process, as well, of course, as to
8 the

issue of prejudice if the Court decides that the Sixth

9 Amendment here applies.
But T would like to talk about a more concrete

10

11 instance of trial prejudice to which the trial court — I am
12 sorry,

the court of appeals also adverted.

Hay I ask you, Mr. Spritzer, what was

MR.

SPRITZER;

16

17

MR. SPRITZER;

It was a divided court.

Equally divided?
Yes.

I think that reflects a

18 division on the court as to the Sixth Amendment issue.

The

I am now advancing.

Dr. MacDonald, when the military police arrived

22 following his call for help, gave a description of the four
23 intruders.

One of them, he said, was a woman; the other

24 three, males.

He described the woman as having blonde hair,

25 wearing a white floppy hat

-- this was February, mind you --

37

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

boots.

He described one of the other men as a black

2 male wearing an Army type field

jacket with sergeant

3 stripes.

Based on that description, a Fayetteville police

who was called into the case prompted by the

6 military police decided that he thought he

9 daughter of

had used

Helene Stokley was the

an Army colonel at Fort Bragg who had left home

10 promptly after graduating from high school, had entered
11 drug culture in

Fayetteville.

Beasley went to Stokley, because he knew that the

12

13 description

that Dr. MacDonald gave seemed to answer her

14 description,

and he knew further that her close friend and

15 associate was a black
16 field

male who typically wore an Army type

jacket with E-6 stripes.
Promptly when he went to see Stokley, she admitted

that I was there, but I was heavy on mescaline, which

21 is,

She said,

of course, a narcotic.

22

Two or three days later, Helene Stokley's

23 neighbor,

one Posey, who had seen her returning to her home

24 at about 5:00 a.m.
25 crime took

on the morning of February 17th,

and the

place during the hours between midnight and 5:00

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 a.m., Posey spoke to Helene Stokley, and she told him that
2 she had held the light during the commission of the crime,
3 but that she herself would not kill anybody.
Dr. MacDonald had told the military police when

4

5 they arrived on the scene that the female intruded had a
6 flickering light on her face as if she were holding a
7 candle.
8

Some time later, Stokley was interviewed by an

9 Army CID agent named Brisentine.

She told Brisentine that

10 she had been involved, and she spoke of blood on the bed,
11

and the words "kill the pigs" had been written on the

12 headboard of the bed in the MacDonald home.

She told him

13

further that she would name the participants in this crime

14

if granted immunity.

She was not granted immunity, of

15 course.
Stokley in all made admissions to seven different

16

17 out of court auditors, acquaintances, friends, law
18

enforcement officers.

Many of these admissions, in fact I

19 think I might say all of these admissions, were fragmentary,
20 and she would immediately equivocate for reasons that are
21 obvious.

She would make an admission, apparently impelled

22 by the feeling that she needed to relieve herself of her
23 feelings, and then she would promptly turn around and say,
24 well, I won't say any more, I have already said too much.
25

Let me now turn to the finding of the court of

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 appeals with respect to Stokley's testimony.
2 that the failure of Stokley
3 she took

The court said

to verify, because Stokley when

the stand claimed she no longer remembered what had

4 happened on the night in question, the failure to verify Dr.
5 MacDonald's account from the witness stand may well have
6 been disastrous to the defense.

7 Murnaghan goes on,

Had she testified, Judge

"as it was reasonable to expect she might

8 have testified, the injury to the government's case would

9 have been incalculably great."

And then he adds that the

10 reason she asserted under oath was failure of memory, and

11 finally, that the government's inexcusable delay was a
12 probable cause of the defendant's inability to get an

13 account from her when she took the stand.
14

Stokley,

incidentally, did acknowledge that she

15 remembered where she had been at midnight on February 17th.
16
17 that

QUESTION;

Doesn't the court of appeals also say

the possible reasons why Stokley did not so testify are

18 several,

and then in the footnote say a

likely one is that

19 she was not on the scene of the crime at all?
20

MR. SPRITZER:

I am going to deal further in a few

21 moments, if I may, to some of the circumstances which
22 corroborate, independent circumstances that corroborate
23 Stokley's admissions.

Of course,

there are other

24 possibilities, but the credibility of Stokley’s story was
25 for the jury, had she testified, and the Court has made a

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 finding here that a probable cause of her not appearing to
2 testify before the jury, at least as to these matters, was

3 the long delay for which the government was responsible.
4

Now, it is perfectly true also that there is

5 another possibility, that she may have been feigning when
6 she was called into the public forum a lack of memory as to

7 these events, because she did remember where she was at
8 midnight, and she did remember returning to her home at 5:00

9 a .m ., so it appears that she was abroad during this five
10 hours when the crime took place, and nobody has ever offered

11 any innocent explanation of that activity.
12

QUESTION:

In that subculture that you have

13 described she was part of, was there anything unique about
14 roaming and prowling around in those hours, as there might
15 be for some other people not part of that subculture?
16
17 unique.

MB. SPRITZER:

No, I wouldn't suggest it was

I think it was probably commonplace.

It also

18 appeared from the -- one of Stokley’s admissions that she
19 had testified -- I am sorry, she had stated out of court
20 that one of the parties to this crime had been driving a

21 blue Mustang, and she was seen by Posey returning at 5:00
22 a.m. in a blue car with several men.
23

So, there is a loss of Stokley’s testimony.

She

24 was called a a witness, and she claimed she could no longer
25 remember ten years later what had taken place, and she

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

denied any recollection of all the out of court statements

2

that she had made to the various auditors who heard those

3

admissions against interest.

4

I was about to say, Justice Rehnquist, that there

5

is also the possibility that she was feigning loss of memory

6

on the stand.

7

that the defendant was seriously prejudiced, because it is

8

not possible to say that she would have had the temerity to

9

deny recollection if this trial had been promptly held, or

I don't think that would alter the conclusion

10

that the jury in that circumstances would have credited her

11

denial of recollection.

12

QUESTION;

But those general types of questions

13

are left to juries in criminal cases subject to the motion

14

for new trial, et cetera, are they not?

15
16
17

NR. SPRITZER;

Yes.

The concern here is that the

Stokley story never got to the jury.
QUESTION;

Well, and that, too, is a factor that

18

is generally weighed by the jury.

19

MR. SPRITZER;

They never heard the story.

They

20

never heard what she could have testified to, would have

testified to had she testified in court as she had spoken

out of court.

QUESTION;

But she did take the stand in court,

didn't she?
MR. SPRITZER;

She took the stand, and then when

At least she testified as to why she

5 didn't have a recollection.

7 drugs.

3 said, was likely to be the consequence of the long delay,
4 that that was compounded when it could have been allayed or
5 cured had the government not insisted and successfully
6 insisted upon the exclusion of this critical evidence.

Here

7 was the one identified living person other than the
8 defendant who could have spoken to the question whether
9 there was any truth in his account, evidence, I think, that
10 any observer of this case would regard as the most critical
11 in deciding whether there was truth to Dr. MacDonald's
12 account, and the jury never heard a particle of that
13 testimony.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Horowitz?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. HOROWITZ;

A couple of points, Mr. Chief

19 Justice.

I don't think it serves any purpose to really

20 discuss here whether Helena Stokley committed these murders
21 or not.

I would like to say one thing, though.

This

22 contention was never raised in the district court at all, or
23 on the first appeal.

It was raised for the first time on

24 appeal in 1979, before the court of appeals.

I suggest to

25 you that it is not quite the obvious prejudice that the

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Respondent suggests
2

In fact, I think, as we pointed o ut adequately in

3 our brief, and as the dissenters in the cou rt of appeals
4 suggest, there was absolutely no prejudice at all in this
5 regard.
6 rather,

She testified shortly after the cr ime , she stated,
shortly after the crimes that she d idn 't remember

7 where she was because of drugs, the same th ing that she sai
8 at the trial.

There is just no support in the record for

9 any finding of prejudice to the defense.
10

Second, there is also no support in the record for

1 dismissed by the court of appeals, the only grounds on which
2 a new trial could be ordered.
3

With respect to -- getting back to the Sixth

4 Amendment question,

I think it is important to point out

5 that the prosecution does not avoid the speedy trial
6 guarantee by the expedient of dismissing the indictment and

7 then reindicting.

The period during which the indictment is

8 pending is always countered with the speedy trial guarantee,

9 so you can't just dismiss the indictment and then go in the
10 next day and get a new indictment, and evade the speedy
11 trial clause that way.
12

I suggest the prosecutors have better things to do

13 than to go out and get indictments and then dismiss them and
14 then wait ten years and get another indictment.

That just

15 doesn't happen unless there is a good reason for it.
16

Finally, I would like to point again to this

17 letter from Mr. Malley with respect to Respondent's

18 contention that the adverse effects of the charge were
19 continued unabated during this period when no charges were

20 pending against him.

In this letter, as I pointed out, he

21 asked the government to consider, carefully consider before
22 bringing an indictment against him, and he points out that
23 during the period since the military proceedings ended he
24 has been getting his life back together, and then he goes on
25 to say, "Some of the things you must consider is any sort of

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

formal attempt to accuse him again will result in

2

devastating publicity, enormous financial loss, and personal

3

humiliation to him."

1

f

Thus, Respondent himself has recognized that there

4
5

is a big difference between the period when no charges are

6

pending, after they have been dismissed, and a period when a

7

formal charge is pending.
