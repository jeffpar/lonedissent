ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. LEDERER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. LEDERER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court, there is only one issue which is properly before
10 this Court, and that is the issue of whether or not the
11 Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, in denying attorney's fees
12 under 1988 should have given reasons for its denial.
13
14 this.

The facts and procedural posture of this case are
In 1978, Consolidated Freightways brought suit

15 against a number of officials of the state of Iowa, alleging
16 that Iowa's statutes and the enforcement of it, which banned
1765-foot twin trailers in Iowa, was unconstitutioal.

The

18 complaint alleged that the actions of the Iowa officials in
19 enforcing that statute were a violation of 42 USC 1983, but
20 no damages were requested.

The complaint did, however,

21 request attorneys' fees under 42 USC 1988.
22

The district court bifurcated the trial, and took

23 the case in chief, putting aside the question of attorneys'
24 fees.

The district court found for Consolidated Freightways

25 on the case in chief.

The result was appealed to the Eighth

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Circuit.

The Eighth Circuit affirmed and returned.

It was

2 brought before this Court, and this Court affirmed also.
3

QUESTIONS

But you are asking for your attorneys*s

4 fees in the Eighth Circuit.
5

HE. LEDERER;

That is correct.

At the conclusion

6 of the appeal in the Eighth Circuit, pursuant to the Federal
7 Rules of Appellate Procedure, the clerk of the Eighth
8 Circuit sent a letter directing Consolidated Freightways to
9 file a bill of cost itemizing therein all costs which they
10 desired to have awarded to them, and a warning of waiver if
11 they did not provide all costs.
12

42 USC 1988 provides for the award of attorneys'

13 fees as cost.

To avoid waiver, we filed a bill of cost with

14 the Eighth Circuit that laid out as a separate item
15 attorneys' fees under 1988, and we filed with the bill of
16 cost a letter to the Eighth Circuit informing them that the
17 case below had been bifurcated, and suggesting that remand
18

to the district court would certainly serve judicial economy.

19

20 fees.

There was no briefing of the issue of attorneys'
The Iowa, officials filed in response as is provided

21 for in the rule, a simple statement that they were in
22 opposition, citing no law or no way constituting a brief.
23 The Eighth Circuit chose not to remand to the district
24 court, nor to request briefs.

Instead, it denied attorneys'

25 fees, and the substance of their decision is simply one line

a

1 stating that the motion for attorneys' fees is denied.
2

QUESTIONS

And you say they do not have the

3 discretion to do that?

4

HR. LEDERER;

We say that they do not have the

5 discretion to deny attorneys’ fees without stating the
6 reason for the denial.
7

That is correct.

Immediately after the denial. Consolidated

8 Freightways filed a motion to vacate, requesting either an
9 opportunity to brief the issue, or in the alternative, that
10 the Eighth Circuit vacate its order denying attorneys' fees
11 and remand the case to the district court.

Very short

12 summary briefs supporting that motion were filed, but no
13 extensive briefs were filed on the issue of attorneys'
14 fees.

The Eighth Circuit chose not to vacate its order,

15 denied the motion to vacate, and -16

QUESTION:

On how many different grounds do you

17 suppose they might have rested their denial?

MR. LEDERER:

20 likely to be.

Your Honor, I guess I don't really

There are three that perhaps seem most
In our brief, we went through and itemized

QUESTION:

.That is a number.

23

MR. LEDERER:

That is three.

Well, you know, I don't pretend to

24 understand the process —
25

QUESTION:

Well, which ones do you think they

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 might have rested the denial on?

2

MR. LEDERER;

I think they might have rested it on

3 the Eleventh Amendment, although I think there is law to the
4 opposite in that case.
5

QUESTION;

That is one.

6

MR. LEDERER;

I think they

may have rested

it on

7 the argument that 1983 does not particularly cover this

8 situation.
9

10

QUESTION;

That is two.

MR. LEDERER;

I think they

may have in fact

11 intended in an oblique way to simply send the matter, have

12 the district court decide it initially, and rather than
13 remand the —

14

QUESTION;

Well, could they have rested it on any

15 ground that — well, 1988 applies that as a matter of
16 discretion we are not going to allow it.

17

MR. LEDERER;

Yes, they could have.

They could

18 have rested it on the ground that 1988 applies, but that

19 there were special circmstances in this case that would have
20 prevented an award of attorneys' fees.
21

QUESTION;

Well, what was the argument made by the

22 o th er side in support of the judgment of la

2

QUESTION;

To the Eighth Circuit at all?

3

MR. LEDERER;

No argument was made to the Eighth

4 Circuit at all.
5

QUESTION;

Not even briefed?

6

MR. LEDERER;

7 the sum and substance.

No briefs.

The appendix contains

It was a bill of cost, simply

8itemzing the cost, and a simple statement from Iowa that
9 they were opposed to the allowance of cost.
10

QUESTION;

Not saying on what ground?

11

MR. LEDERER;

Not saying on what grounds.

There

12 were briefs filed in the Eighth Circuit on the motion to
13 vacate
9

14

QUESTION;

Yes.

15

MR. LEDERER;

-- after the Eighth Circuit had

16 already rendered its decision, but there were no briefs
17 filed before the initial decision.
18

QUESTION;

And what was the position taken by Iowa

19 on the motion to vacate?
20

MR. LEDERER;

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. LEDERER;

Iowa opposed the motion to vacate.

On what grounds?
On the grounds that 1983 did not

23 apply, and if I recall correctly, on the grounds that -- I
5

24 am

not sure whether they raised the Eleventh Amendment

25 grounds in their brief or not.

1

QUESTION;

Well, did you meet those grounds of

2 objection at all?
3

MR. LEDERER:

4

QUESTION;

No, we —

In briefing before the Eighth Circuit

5 on the motion?
6

MR. LEDERER;

No, we filed a simple brief

7 supporting the motion to vacate.

They filed a brief

8 opposing the motion to vacate, and the Eighth Circuit
9 decided on those two briefs.
10

QUESTION;

Well, what I am trying to get at, what

11 issues did you — on what grounds did you oppose the motion
12 to vacate?
13

MR. LEDERER;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. LEDERER;

Did I oppose the motion —

Or support it.

I am sorry.

We supported it on the grounds that

16 ^2 USC 1988 was applicable, and that no special
17 circumstances existed here.
18

QUESTION;

And did you address the 1983 question?

19

MR. LEDERER;

We did very summarily, yes.

I

20 should make it clear the brief was intended as a brief to
21 support the motion to vacate.
22

QUESTION;

Yes.

23

MR. LEDERER;

The motion to vacate requested that

24 the Eighth Circuit, if it desired to decide this issue
25 itself, set up a briefing schedule, permit us to file briefs

1 and. affidavits on it.

It was not a brief on the issue of

2 whether or not attorneys* fees should be awarded.

It did

3 cover that issue to the extent of trying to point out to the
4 Eighth Circuit this is a real issue and not something -5

QUESTION:

Well, did the motion request the Eighth

6 Circuit to state the grounds of its denial?
7

MR. LEDERER:

8

QUESTION:

9 that

Yes, it did.

But you must have taken the position

1983 covered this action.

10

MR. LEDERER:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, we did.

And that under 1988, the Court of

12 Appeals or the District Court did not possess sufficient
13 discretion to deny your motion for your bill of costs even
14 though it was covered,

your substantive action was covered

15 by 1983.

16

MR. LEDERER:

17 certainly -- you know,

That's correct, Your Honor.
we certainly took the position

18 consistently throughout that

QUESTION;

1

Do you think under the statute the

2 problem would have been satisfied if the Court simply
3 recited

in the exercise of our discretion fees are denied,

4 or do they have to say

A, B, C, D, what guided their

5 decision ?

MB. LEDEBER;

6
7 think
8

No.

I should make clear I don't

the courts necessarily have to write erudite opinions

on each matter that comes before them.

All that was

9 necessary here could have been disposed of in one or two
10 sen tences.

QUESTION;

11

What about the one sentence I just gave

12 you, in the exercise of our discretion, fees are denied?

MR. LEDEBER;

13

14 question, but yes,
15 It

That would have been a closer

I think that would have been adequate.

would have at least provided the parties the idea that

16 what the problem was here was a factual

problem, that it was

17 the court exercising its discretion and

not making a legal

18 decision that
19
20 I think

1983 doesn't apply.

The reason why I think a reason -- the reason why
some statement of reason is required by the Eighth

21 Circuit Court of Appeals is perhaps well illustrated by this
22 case.

The common practice in most circuit court of appeals

23 for attorneys'

fees on the appeal is to have that decided by

24 the district court.

That is the practice that this Court

25 originally encouraged in antitrust cases, Perkins v.

1 Standard Oil, and has been

followed fairly consistently by

2 all of the circuits, though I think all of the circuits

3 recognize that they have the power to decide attorneys' fees
4 themselves.
5

The Eighth Circuit has not been consistent with

6 the other circuits.

It frequently decides attorneys' fees

7 itself, setting both the amount of the fees and making the
8 initial decision as to whether or not fees should be

9 granted

That makes this Court the initial court of review.

10 There is no other court to
11

QUESTION*

which an appeal can be taken.

Well, does that not then demonstrate

12 that they acknowledge that it is a discretionary matter?

13 The practice you have just described.

Doesn't that suggest

14 that they acknowledge that they had the legal authority
15 under 1988 16

MR. LEDERER:

17

QUESTION*

Oh, yes.

Well, I think

-- but that as a matter of discretion ,

18 they were not going to give the fees?

MR. LEDERER*

That's right.

That is difficult to

MR. LEDERER*

Right.

1

QUESTION;

-- the court hereby denies the fees.

2

NR. LEDERER;

If the court exercised discretion,

3 then under the interpretation of the statute they would have

4 found special circumstances, and I think a statement that
5 they exercised discretion logically means that they found
6 special circumstances, which are the instances in which the
7 statute permits attorneys' fees not to be awarded, and that
8 would have been enough of a guidance to both this Court and
9 to us as attorneys so that we could have at least determined
10 what the issue was on appeal.
11

QUESTION;

Aren't you saying in effect that you

12 are willing to lose this case but you just want the Eighth
13 Circuit to write a couple more sentences?
14

MR. LEDERER;

Well, the difficulty is -- I don't

15 know that I would say that I am willing to lose this case,
16 but what the issue here is, as I see it, is, we need to know
17 why it was denied, so that we can determine, is this an
18

issue that should be appealed?

19 Eighth Circuit was wrong?

Is this an issue where the

Perhaps the Eighth Circuit is

20 right, and on reflection and reviewing the opinion we may
21 conclude that yes, we lost, and we lost fairly.
22

The difficulty with this Court standing as the

23 only court of appeal, the initial court of review, this
24 Court has to pick and choose what cases it is going to hear,
25 and for it to pick and choose what cases it is going to

So why do we have to have it in this

What makes this one so special?

16

HR. LEDERER*

Well, I think what makes it so

17 special in part is that you are dealing with a federal
18 court, and in part, one of the powers that this Court has is
*

19 supervisory powers over the federal courts.

This Court

20 Properly should determine how it wants cases presented to it,
21

QUESTION*

What about the Fifth Circuit's rule

22 where they simply affirm by order on the merits, not on
23 costs, without any opinion or any explanation of reasons?
24

MR. LEDERER*

You can perhaps justify no opinion

25 where you have a district court opinion below, and the

You can — and the Eighth

That at least tells the

attorney on what basis his case was decided.
Here, we have no way of determining what the basis

we reverse, or pardon me,

was for the decision.
QUESTIONS

9

Since you have just told us, counsel,

10 that the Eighth Circuit practice is — recognizes that it is
11

a discretionary power, and sometimes they allow and

12 sometimes they do not allow fees,
13 think,

and you have also said, I

in precisely these words, that it would have

14 satisfied

the statute if they had recited, in the exercise

15 of our discretion,
16

the application for fees is denied.

Now, doesn't the word "deny" embrace that just as

17 a denial of cert up here —
18

ME. LEDERERs

19

QUESTIONS

20 don't explain it.
21 accepted

22

Well, Your Honor, I perhaps --

— states — when we deny cert, we
We deny, and the -- I think it is

that that is an exercise of our discretion.
MR. LEDERERf

I perhaps put too much emphasis on

23 the words "in the exercise of our discretion",
24 immediately

because I

put that in the framework of the statute.

25 statute as interpreted

The

requires an award of attorneys' fees

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 unless some very narrow factual circumstances exist.

So, if

2 the Court says, in the exercise of our discretion, we deny
3 attorneys' fees, that means they have gotten past the legal
4 question of whether or not the statute applies, and as soon
5 as they say, we are exercising discretion, you immediately

6 know this must be the reason why they are denying.
7

So, in this particular circumstance, exercise of

8 discretion, because the discretion is so narrow as to the
9 award, granted, very large as to the amount of the award,

10 but very narrow as to whether or not you do award, it tells
11 you what the court is doing.

12

QUESTIONS

I thought I heard you answer my Brother

13 Marshal that if you have no
14 have no claim under

1983 cause of action, then you

1988 for attorneys's fees.

Is that

15 right?
16

MR. LEDERERs

That's correct.

In this case, that

17 is correct.
18

QUESTIONS

Well, may we not then see what you have

19 pleaded in the way of cause of action, and if we hold there
20 was no 1983 cause of action pleaded, can't we affirm without
21 more?
22

MR. LEDERERs

This Court certainly can.

It has

23 the power to do so.

24

QUESTIONS

Is there any reason we shouldn't?

25

MR. LEDERERs

Yes.

I think the reason that you

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. LEDERERs

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

2 should frame it a little bit more clearly.
3 there is a

I perhaps

I think that

right to engage in interstate commerce, and I

4 think that that is a fundamental right.

I think it was

5 recognized as a fundamental right at the time of the
6 Constitution, and that the Constitution secures that right
7 by putting a provsion in it providing, in effect, to at
8 least some degree, exclusive jurisdiction in Congress to
9 regulate interstate commerce, because the drafters
10 recognized that state regulation was inimical to the right
11 to engage in interstate commerce.
12

QUESTION;

But Cooley against Board of Wardens,

13 before the Civil War, established that Congress’s right to
14 regulate interstate commerce was not exclusive.
15

MR. IEDERER;

This Court has always held that

16 there are some areas where Congress can regulate, some sets
17

of circumstances where Congress can regulate but the states

18

cannot.

Now, what the definition is of what the states

19 cannot regulate has changed through the 200 years, but there
20 have always been areas where the states can’t regulate,
21 because they impose an unconstitutional burden or perhaps
22 because it is directe-indirect regulation, depending upon
23 which commerce clause test you use, but there has always
24 been held to be an area that is exempt from state
25 regulations, and that is precisely what the drafters

19

1 unreasonably interpreting it, because, as I say, part of the
2 reason for the original Constitutional Convention was the
3 recognition that the state regulation was causing problems,

4 and part of the reason for granting the power to Congress
5 was to remove it from the states.
QUESTION*

6

You certainly find several instances of

7 this Court referring to the right to engage in interstate
8 commerce free from the wrong kind of state regulation.

9

BE. LEDERER*

That's correct.

That's correct.

10 The original Gibbons v. Ogden, Justice Marshal referred to a
11 right to engage in interstate commerce as a natural right of
12 man.

This Court in its commerce clause cases has frequently

13 spoken of a right to be free of improper state regulation.
14 Now, what constitutes improper state regulation, I think, in
15 any given case can be debated, but that there is an area
16 where the Constitution by its own words removes from the
17

states the power to regulate, whether it be for improper

18

regulation, or only certain subject matter, or whatever,

19 there is an area that is removed from state regulation.
20

That is the protection, the securing of the right

21 to engage in interstate commerce that we think was violated
22 by Iowa.

We had a right, the right to engage in interstate

23 commerce, repeatedly recognized by this Court, recognized as
24 a natural and inalienable right.

It was secured by the

25 Constitution because one of the purposes of the commerce

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 clause is to remove from the state the power to regulate
2 interstate commerce in certain instances, and this is one of
3 those instances.

The right was violated.

Consequently,

4 1983 was violated.
5

QUESTION;

Mr. Lederer, would you agree that if

6 the Court did not agree with that analysis and felt that
7 this really was not a 1983 case and therefore 1988 was not
8 intended to authorize the award of fees in this case, then
9 there would be no duty in the court of appeals to give you a
10 statement of reasons?

If the law is, you are not entitled

11 to fees, why do they have to give you a statement of reasons?
12

ME. LEDERER;

13 court of appeals may have decided —

QUESTION;

Well, supposing we had a case last year

22 in which we said 1988 doesn't apply to a case like this.
23 Then your fee request was presented to the court of
24 appeals.

Couldn't they simply deny it without an opinion?

25

MR. LEDERER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. SCHANTZ, ESQ.,

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16

MR. SCHANTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

17 the Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held below
18 that Consolidated Freightways was not entitled to attorneys’

19 fees for the appeal part of the litigation in the case in
20 chief with which this Court is previously familiar.

Was that, Mr. Schantz, for the appeal

22 part in that court or also here?

1

QUESTION i

I see

2

HR. SCHANTZj

Iowa has consistently taken the

3 position that dormant commerce clause case litigation is not

4 within 1 983.

We took that position in our answer.

We took

5 that position with counsel, as the letter to the clerk to
6 which he referred makes clear.

We have indicated that we

7 were going to oppose any award of fees.

We resisted the

8 bill of costs, indicating that we objected to any award of
9 fees.

When they moved to vacate, we made very explicit that

10 it was our contention that 1983 was not applicable, and in
11 our brief in resistance to the motion to vacate, we
12 developed, admittedly in skeletal form, the contention which
13 is developed in our brief, namely, that commerce clause
14 cases involve the allocation of governmental power, and do
15 not secure individual rights.
16

So, we believe that issue was clearly presented to

17the court below, and we believe, we think it is clearly
18 implicit in the course of the proceeding that that was the
19 basis for the Eighth Circuit's action.

But even if it is

20 not , we think it is clear that this Court may and would need
21 to address the — may affirm on the ground that we presented
22 below, namely, that it was not a 1983 case.
23

QUESTION:

This is on the ground that you may

24 defend your judgment in your favor on any ground that you
25 raise for it.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. SCHANTZ;

Exactly.

The rule of Langnes versus

2 Green and Dandridge versus Williams, and so on.
3

Congress — the general rule, of course, is that

4 — American rule is that fee shifting is not permitted.
5 Congress has authorized fee shifting in certain civil rights
6 statutes under 42 United States Code Section 1988.

The

7 onliy such statute invoked here is 42 USC Section 1983, and
8 thus the question becomes whether Section 1983 provides a
9 remedy for dormant commerce clause cases.
10

Section 1983 provides a remedy in the language of

11 the statute
12 privilege,

when there has been a deprivation of a right,
or immunity secured by the Constitution, and the

13 particular question before this Court then is whether that
14 language should be construed to

15

reach commerce clause cases.

Iowa's contention that 1983 does not reach dormant

16 commerce clause litigation can loosely be divided into two
17 propositons.

The first is that the reach of Section 1983 is

18 not coextensive with the Constitution.
19 which a constitutional claim is asserted

Not every lawsuit in
against a state or

20 a state official involves the deprivation of any rights,
21 privileges,

22

or immunities secured by the Constitution.

The second proposition is that -- the minor

23 premise, if you will, is that the commerce clause should be

24 understood as a provision allocating authority, structuring
25 governmental power,

and not as a provision securing rights

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 against government
2

I think, the first proposition, the proposition

3 that the reach of 1983 is not co-extensive with the
4 Constitution, is what must be regarded as well established.
5 In Chapman versus Houston Welfare Rights Organization, this
6 Court held, and, I believe, without dissent on this point,
7 that litigation against state officials which invokes the
8 supremacy clause without more cannot be brought pursuant to
928 USC Section 1343(3).
10

Now, the language of 1343(3) is completely

11 identical to the language of

1983 as it relates to the

12 Constitution.

Certainly not.

General Schantz, let me go back to your

1983.

That is
But with

7 respect to the Constitution, rights secured by the
8

Constitution, the language is identical, and in Lynch versus

9 Household Finance,

this Court said clearly that with respect

11 1983 are the same.

22

MR. SCHANTZ;

23

Well —

See, in that case, there were two ways

24 to characterize the claim, one as a violation of a federal

2 really, that was a statutory — but here you have no basis
3 other than the constitutional provision itself, so it seems

4 to me it is quite different.
5

ME. SCHANTZs

Well, the supremacy clause is a

6 relational clause rather than a grant of substantive power,
7 and I won't press the analogy to the end.

I think we have

8 something more to establish, if you will, but I understood
9 Petitioner to argue in his brief essentially that any
10 constitutional claim doesn't have to involve rights, can be
11 brought within 1983, and we believe that that -- a supremacy
12 clause case is in a sense a constitutional claim, not
13 necessarily in the same sense as is involved here.

In drafting 1983, the 42nd Congress did not employ

22 the language of Article III, cases arising under the

24 predecessor, Section 1331, they did use the language,

25 arising under.

We don't believe that is an accident.

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

HR. SCHANTZ:

9 that the establishment clause has an individual rights

11 wrestled with in Flast v. Cohen, I think, sharpens that and
12 suggests that that would be a hard case, but I think it is a

So you would say that 1988 would apply

Congress in many respects can expand or contract

The person challenging that might

5 have at least two different claims.
6

One would be that the city did not have the

7 authority under state law to zone for esthetic purposes.
8 They might also have a claim that this constituted a taking
9 of property without due process of law.
10 a claim of individual right.

The latter claim is

It is a claim that no

11 government, no government can take my property without

12 compensating me for it.
13

The other claim is an ultra vires claim.

It is

14 defeasible in the sense that the Iowa legislature could in

15 the next session turn around and authorize zoning for
16 esthetic purposes.

I think that distinction is basic to our

17 constitutional jurisprudence, despite the fact that the

18 admittedly abstract term "right" is occasionally used to
19 announce a result, if you will,

rather than as here, as a

Mr. Schantz, your opponent places a

22 good bit of reliance, as I read his brief, on the Northcross

You don’t cite it.

Do you have any comment to make

25

HR. SCHANTZ:

The Sixth Circuit denied without

The Petitioner sought review by this Court.

8 This Court held that, yes, this case fell within Section
9718.
10

Attorneys* fees were authorized.
This Petitioner was -- They addressed that

11 question, as we are asking this Court to address that
12 question, resolved it,

and then said, but perhaps the Sixth

13 Circuit was denying fees in the exercise of its discretion.
14 It did not inform us of that, so we will remand for further
15 proceedings,

where they can express the discretionary

16 reasons for denying fees.
17

So, at least in terms of addressing this issue,

18 Northcross would support this Court affirming on the basis
19 that commerce clause cases do not — are not within

1983.

20 And it also does not —
21

But the Northcross case also held that

22 this Court had in two other cases prior to that said that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. LEDERER, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

14

HR. LEDERERs

The question which I think has been

15

addressed in several different ways of whether or not there

16

is a right present, in several cases has been addressed as

17

whether or not the Constitution creates a right.

18

assert that the Constitution creates a right to engage in

19

interstate commerce.

We do not

What we assert is that there predated

20 and pre-existed the Constitution a right to engage in
21

commerce, a subspecies of the right to possess property, or

22

as stated in many of the colonial constitutions, to acquire,

23

possess, and protect property, and that the Constitution

24

secured that right, not that it created it, but it secured

25

it, and the way it secured it was by removing from the

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 States and giving to Congress the power to regulate the
2 right.
3

Hr. Schantz suggested that there could be no right

4 because obviously Congress had the power to take away the
5 ability of ray client to use 65-foot twin trailers if it
6 chose to pass the bill.

Yes, Congress could do that.

The

7 fact that you can pass regulations regulating the right does
8 not mean that the right does not exist, any more than the
9 fact, as was addressed before this Court this morning, that
10 we may put limits on the right of lawyers to speak in
11 advertisements means that there is no right to engage in
