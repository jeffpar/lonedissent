ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11

MR. KUNTZ;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

12

The principal issue before the Court this

13 morning

is:

Did the Hendrick Hudson Central School

14 District meet the
15 Education
16 it

requirements of Public Law 94-142, the

of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, when

provided Amy Rowley with an educational program which

17 resulted

in outstanding academic achievement and social

18 success,

although it did not comply with her parents'

19 wishes that

a sign language interpreter be placed in her

20 classroom.

In one respect the case that's before you is

21

22 an age-old problem that confronts every
23 board.

that the parents disagree with the program

And

the question before you then becomes, how does this Act

dictate to the local educational institution that better

14 provided to

Amy Rowley.

As a matter of fact,

15 extraordinary care was taken to ensure benefit from the

20 classified as severely deaf.
21

The committee on the handicapped conducted an

22 investigation of what was an appropriate placement for
23 Amy in first grade.

They visited other classrooms.

24 They sent one of their members to see Amy in her first
25 grade classroom setting and

to see how she was doing

The committee on the handicapped dispatched

would do for Amy was to place her in a regular -- to

classroom, to supplement her hearing with an FM wireless

system which amplifies the sound spoken into the sending

the services of a speech therapist three times a week;

that she would receive the services of a certified

contend is an inaccurate view of the purpose of the Act

It's our contention that the Act is a funding

that as a funding statute the provision of

We believe

education is left to the states under the Constitution.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kuntz, perhaps you mentioned

it, but were is Amy now?
MR. KURTZ;

14 not mention it.

Amy’s in the fourth grade.

Your Honor.

I did

She's in the fourth grade

15 at the Hendrick Hudson School District.
16

QUESTION;

And has she maintained her place

17 with the others?
18

MR. KUNTZ;

Yes.

As a result of the

19 affirmance by the Second Circuit of the District Court
20 decision, a sign language interpreter was placed in her
21

22

classroom early in the third grade.
Our review of the progress of Amy indicates

23 that she has continued as one would expect her to
24 continue, that she’s made the same progress with the
25 sign language interpreter that she made without the sign

language interpreter.

We see no significant

2 dif ference.
3

While she has made some increase in her

4

spelling skills, her mathematics skills declined

5

somewhat, but not precipitously in either case and we

6 find that her progress has continued on the same upward
7 satisfactory

level that it did prior to the time that

the sign language interpreter was placed in her

description and purposes of a state plan as mandated by

2 the Act.

QUESTION*

Counsel, I take it that under the

state plan in question it's your position that the

school district could have furnished an interpreter, but

Is it your contention that the

MR. KUNTZ*

Yes, we believe that, Your Honor.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

We believe that the court has the power to send it

2 back.

We don't believe that the court has the power to

3

simply set aside the state plan and substitute a

4

different methodology of education.

5

QUESTION;

The section does provide for de

6 novo review, doesn’t it?
7

ME. KUNTZ;

Not in those words.

It provides

8 that the court shall receive the proceedings of the
9

administrative agency, at the request of either party

10

shall receive new evidence, and taking all of that into

11

consideration make its determination based upon the

12

preponderance of the evidence, granting such remedy as

13

it deems appropriate.

14

But we say even if it --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KUNTZ:

That's pretty de novo, isn't it?

Yes, I suppose it's as de novo as

17

you can get.

But it does require the receipt of the

18

administrative records and the prior determinations.

19

it was totally de novo, I would think that the

20

requirement to receive those records would not be found

21

in the statute.
QUESTION:

22

Well then, there are really

23

inconsistencies or cross-currents in the statute, are

24

there not?

25

ME. KUNTZ;

Yes, there are.

QUESTION;

Because certainly if it were a

2 substantive determination that the judge were to make,
3 you would expect that Congress would have provided for
4 some deference to the administrative record.
5

MR. KUNTZ:

I would have thought so.

And we

6 believe that the proper way to reconcile those
7 differences is to look at 1415 as remedial only.

The

8 Respondents look at it, and some of the amici and
9 frankly many if the circuits look upon it, as a statute
10

granting them absolute authority to write a new

11

substantive program without regard to the state plan and

12

without regard to the cost of whatever program they

13 devise.
14

As a matter of fact,

I believe the Seventh

15 Circuit has explici tly ruled tha t cost is n o
16 con sideration when

the court makes its dete rmination as

17 to what is an appro priate remedy.

Tha t cir cuit also

22 edu cation.
23

QUESTION;

Did you tak e the same position as

24 you 're now expressi ng in the Court of Appea Is?
25

MR.

KUNTZ;

Yes,

we did, Your Honor.

In our

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 brief and our reply brief, we specifically set forth the
2 portions of our brief where we made those arguments.
3

QUESTIONS

Mr. Kuntz, may I ask, is it your

4 view that a federal judge may merely require compliance
5 with the procedures specified in the Act and that there
6 is no substantive standard that the federal judge may
7 apply to define what is a free appropriate public
8 education?
9

Say you’re -- in this case, I know it is not

10 the case.

But supposing what you did is have a teacher

11 with a loud voice and nothing more, or something like
12 that, that most people would say was clearly not
13 sufficient.

Could the federal judge correct anything at

14 all substantively?
15

MB. KUNTZs

I would think that in that

16 particulae situation, that the first thing that would
17 occur is a finding that the procedure had not been
18 followed.

I seriously doubt whether a proper view of

19 the child -- that is, the Act requires the local school
20 district to plan for the unique needs of that child.
21 think that's a procedural requirement.
22

I think that once there’s an explanation of

23 what those needs are and once there is some rational
24 relationship developed between the response to those
25 needs and the program that's provided, that in most

I

1

cases the local school district will come out with an

2

adequate and acceptable program.

3

I tend to think in your situation that, in

4

your example, that you would find so many procedural

5

errors in arriving at that determination that there

6 would be no need to get into a substantive
7 determination.

Well, supposing the board had a

we can't afford to have our teachers take

the time off to take sign language training, as you did,

12 and

we can't afford any of these things.

We're just

13

going to do the best we can, which is to select the

14

teacher we think would have the best rapport and has the

15 best

diction, but did very little other than that, for

16 reasons that very well might make good sense for a board
17

that has a tight budget.

18
19

MR. KUNTZ;

I would hate to think that there

would be no situation where the court couldn't step in

20 and cure a totally
21

arbitrary and capricious act.

QUESTION;

The problem I have with the case

22 is, as soon as you acknowledge
23 substantive
24
25 that

that there's some

review, then what's the stopping point?

MR. KUNTZ;
there is that;

I totally agree with you.

I feel

Once you grant one case, then every

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

other case follows behind it, and it's only a question

2 of degree.

But I truly believe that Congress did not in

3 this particular statute move in

and determine for each

4 local school district that ultimately what is to be the
5 governing philosophy in that particular school district
6 is what a court,
7 And

federal or state, tells the agency.

I'm afraid that's what happens when you carry the

8 logic to its extreme on the other side.
9

QUESTION;

10 board

11

Is it your view that this school

has done more than they were required to do?
HR. KUNTZ;

12 complied with

Yes, they did.

They not only

the state plan as it specifies services

13 for deaf children whose audiological loss is within the
14 range that Amy's is,
15 far over and beyond
16

but they provided extra services
what they were required to do.

I think critical to the school district’s

17 position is that program that they developed worked,
18 that the program that the court

and

substituted does not

19 particularly appear to the school district to be that
20 much better.
21

As a matter of fact, the school district

believes that ultimately in the long run it does Amy a

22 disservice,

because it does not take advantage,

23 speak, of her residual skills.
24 advantage and

And those skills

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

will atrophy

2

And to come back to Justice Marshall’s point

3 before,

while it’s not in the record because the

4 developments occurred post

the trial, it's the school

5 district's finding that that's what's occurring in Amy's
6 situation.
7

QUESTION;

But this Court of Appeals limited

8 its decision to the facts in this case.
9

MR. KUNTZ;

10

QUESTION;

Yes, I think because they -So it wasn't any broad, general

11

sweep like you're talking about, was it?

12

you were wrong in this case for the facts that were

13 before it at that time.

It said that

What's wrong with that?

Isn't

14 that the normal way to decide a case?
15

MR. KUNTZ;

Then it becomes a case about Amy,

16 as the court Said in its opening sentence:

17 case about Amy."

"This is a

It's also a case about the law, and

18 every case that’s decided by the Court of Appeals is
19 precedent.

I simply don't know how any court is going

20 to distinguish
21

deaf child.

Amy’s case from the case of any other

Amy's situation is not an unusual

MR. KUNTZi

No, it wasn’t, Your Honor, and the

6 reason why that occurred is that when the school
7 district made a motion to dismiss the complaint on the
8 ground that the educational program provided to Amy was
9 in conformity with the state plan, on the hearing of
10 that motion the Respondents admitted that the plan had
11 been developed, that the plan had been accepted by the
12 then Commissioner of Education,

that the school district

13 was in compliance with the plan, but that that was
14 irrelevant.
15

And consequently the plan never became a part

16 of the record, because it was never at issue.

We felt

17 that the District Court should have dismissed the case

It did not address

The shortfall

in her comprehension is precisely the deficiency

14 Amy needs a visual depiction of oral communications.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SCHULDER;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
In my portion of the argument I would like to

23

address several of Petitioner's contentions that raise

24

fundamental questions about the purpose and intent of

25

Congress in enacting the Education of the Handicapped

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Act in 1975

2

Relying on this Court's recent decision last

3 term in Pennhurst,

Petitioners argue that the Act does

4 not entitle individual handicapped children and their
5 parents to claim a substantive right to a free
6 appropriate public education.

They also contend that

7 the judicial review provisions of the Act limit review
8 to matters of procedure and

do not permit a handicapped

9 child and his or her parents to challenge determinations
10 of

11

state and local school authorities concerning

particular services that are to be given to an

12 individual child.

13

Instead, Petitioners assert that the Act

14 merely requires that the services provided to a child
15 conform to the state plan prepared by the state
16 commissioner of education pursuant to the Act, and that
17 if the individual program complies with the plan there
18 is no further recourse.
19

These claims are completely contrary to the

20 Congressional intent as reflected in
21

history of the statute.

22 Pennhurst,

the language and

Unlike the state at issue in

the Education of the Handicapped Act requires

24 recipient state have in effect a policy that assures all
25 handicapped children the right to a free appropriate

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

public education

2

The Act also requires the states, as a

3 condition of

receiving funds, to develop a plan setting

4 forth in detail the

procedures and policies that it

5 intends to provide in order to assure that a free
6 appropriate public education will be available to all
7 handicapped
8

children within the state within certain

periods.

9

The Act also requires as a condition of

10 receiving funds that the states establish

11

procedures to

assure that to the maximum extent appropriate

12 handicapped children receive supplemental aids and
13 services to

allow them to be educated together with

14 non-handicapped children.
15

The legislative history confirms that Congress

16 meant to establish a statutory right of individual
17 handicapped children to a free appropriate public
18 education.

For example -QUESTION:

19

How does one get from there to the

20 standard that apparently

MR. SCHULDER;

No -- well, he may have said

To fulfil --

We don't talk about potentials

We're simply talking about access to the same

12 information.
13

QUESTION;

Maybe we need to talk about this

14 potential, because that certainly figured in the case.
15

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, that may have figured in

16 Congress' enactment of the statute.
17

QUESTION;

Don't you think it figured in the

18 decision of the District Court or the Court of Appeals?
19

MR. SCHULDER;

It may have figured as a factor

20 in the decision of the District Court, but I don’t
21 believe that the Court of Appeals relied on that aspect
22 of the District Court's decision.

And we do not submit

23 that the Court needs to go that far in upholding the
24 judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case.
25

QUESTION;

Would it be inconsistent with the

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Act to believe that as long as there is an individual

2 educational program and plan made for the child which is
3 within the meaning and requirements of the state plan,
4 which has been in turn approved by the appropriate
5 federal official, that that is sufficient?
6

MB. SCHULDERi

No, Your Honor.

The state plan

7 is simply a general administrative mechanism for the
8 state to develop to show the Secretary of Education that
9 it’s in general compliance with the goals of the
10 statute.

The Act provides that the free appropriate

11 public education that is to be provided the handicapped
12 children must meet the unique needs of each child.

QUESTION:

I said, is it inconsistent with the Act to

15 find that the school district has complied with it if it
16 has an individual educational plan for that individual
17 child which is in conformity with the state plan, which

Is that inconsistent with

No, Your Honor.

Under the Act,

That’s part of the

Mr. Schulder, do you know how much

MR. SCHULDER;

MR. SCHULDER;

I do not know offhand.

Do you know how many of these cases

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, there is a -- I do know

13 that there's a very minimal number of cases that reach
14 the federal or state courts, Your Honor.

In the amicus

15 brief for the Association for Retarded Citizens, at
16 pages 18 to

19 there are two footnotes, 23 and 24,

that

17 indicate that very, very few individual cases even get

But I believe that the

was developed from sources, studies made by

3 the Department of Education.
4

The Act in question here has two basic

5 themesi

One is the requirement that to the maximum

6 extent appropriate handicapped children are to be

7 mainstreamed, that is educated together with
8 non-handicapped children.

The second theme of the Act

9 is, as I mentioned earlier, providing a full educational
10 opportunity for
11

all handicapped children.

The legislative history, as I said, clearly

12 demonstrates Congress’

intent that participating states

13 ensure that handicapped children have an equal
14 educational opportunity.

In other words, in this case,

15 that they have access to the same educational program
16 that is available to other non-handicapped children in
17 the particular school.
18

QUESTION;

Is there any recognition whatever

19 in your submission that the degree of disability varies
20 very widely?
21

Sadly, there are some children with IQ’s

of 40, deaf and dumb.

What is a state required to do

22 with respect to such a child?

HR. SCHULDER;

Well, Congress realized that

Is that what would be the typical amount of

3

MR. SCHULDER;

No, Your Honor.

Congress was

4 aware that providing educational servides for
5 handicapped children would require substantial
6 expenditures.

And I believe the estimates that were

7 developed by Congress or at hearings before Congress
8 prior to passage of the Act indicated that

the average

9 cost of educating a handicapped child would be
10 approximately
11

1.9 or 2 percent times the average cost of

educating a non-handicapped child.

12

The brief, the amicus brief of the Cerebral

13 Palsy Association contains statistics that show that the
14 actual average cost that statistics have been prepared
15 for since the Act has been in effect show that the cost

has been within the range that Congress had anticipated

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

3

MR. KUNTZf

Just a few brief comments in

4 rebuttal.
5

In answer to two questions raised by Justice

6 Stevens,

the Government's brief states that — I think

7 you have the figures correctly -- around $27,000.
8 Consequently, the cost
9 child.
10 which
11

is about $160 per handicapped

That does comport with the national average,
is between $150 to $200.

And the State of New

York received $45 million for approximately 200,000

12 children.

So consequently the statistics show that a

13 significant portion
14 Federal
15

of that burden is not borne by the

Government.
The records also show, developed by Congress

16 through the reports submitted to Congress and required
17 by Congress and

submitted by the Secretary,

that the

18 percentage of funding is on a decreasing level.
19 now down to, in this last fiscal

It's

year, approximately

20 eight percent of the cost of educating the average
21
22

child.
I also wanted to deal just for a moment, too,

23 with your question before to counsel for the Respondents
24 about whether the decision requires every child to have
25 a sign language interpreter.

The court made, in our

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

view, an unwarranted leap from an audiological test

2 conducted in isolation in
3 found

a laboratory setting, which

that Amy only could hear 59 percent -- it was a

4 word discrimination test.
5

The court leapt from that fact to a conclusion

6 which we believe is

unwarranted, that is that Amy

7 understands only 59

percent of what transpires in her

8 class.

We say that the unrebutted evidence is that she

9 understands nearly all of what transpires in her class.
10
11

Now, the court was able to reach the decision
it did by adopting the philosophical approach of the

12 Respondents

in this case, and that approach was that

13 every deaf child does better with a sign
14 interpreter

in their class.

15 she does better.

Amy is deaf, consequently

They adopted that syllogism.

The

16 rationale for that syllogism was presented by the
17 Respondents'
18

experts at the trial court.

As a matter of fact,

when the case was tried

19 before the independent hearing officer the
20 case consisted
21

of three witnesses and a total of about

The parents introduced no evidence whatsoever

3

at either the trial before the independent hearing

how Amy was doing in class, because in their view that

consideration was irrelevant because of the
