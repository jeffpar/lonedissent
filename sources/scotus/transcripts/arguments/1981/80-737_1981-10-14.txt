ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. PARRINELLO, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

MR.

PARRINELLOi

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

9 please the Court, the question presented by this case is
10 whether limits on contributions to ballot measure campaign
11 committees violate the First Amendment guarantees of speech
12 and association.
13

Berkeley law limits to $250 the amount that a

14 citizen may contribute to support or oppose a ballot
15 measure.

This case arose out of a

1977 Berkeley election

16 where voters were asked to accept or reject a proposal

which

17 would have enacted rent control in the city of Berkeley.
18

Groups of citizens associated together to oppose

19 the rent control ballot measure.

Under Berkeley law,

that

20 citizen association was deemed to be a campaign committee.
21 The committee solicited and received contributions in excess
22 of $250.00.

Shortly before the election, the city decided

23 that those contributions violated the campaign contribution
24 limit, and it ordered the committee to immediately forfeit
25 the excess funds to the city treasury.

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Believing that the forfeiture would impair its

2 ability to communicate its message to the electorate prior
3 to election day, the committee and its supporters filed suit
4 and sought and obtained preliminary injunctive relief in the
5 superior court, and used the additional funds to communicate
6 its message to the voters prior to the election.
7

Thereafter, the committee moved for and obtained

8 summary judgment in the superior court, which held that the
9 campaign contribution limit violated the First Amendment.
10

The California Court of Appeals, by a vote of

11 three judges to none, affirmed the summary judgment.

The

12 California Supreme Court, by a vote of four judges to three,
13 reversed, splitting on the constitutional issue.
14

The majority opinion of the California Supreme

15 Court failed to reconcile itself with, or even to recognize,
16 a prior decision of the United States Court of Appeals for
17 the Fifth Circuit, which struck, down virtually identical
18 ballot measure contribution limits in the state of Florida.
19 That unanimous opinion of the Fifth Circuit, entitled Let’s
20 Help Florida v. McCrary, is now pending before this Court.
21

It is important to emphasize that this case

22 involves ballot measure campaigns and ballot measure
23 campaign committees.

It does not involve candidate

24 campaigns for public office.
25

A limitation on the amount that citizens may

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 contribute to a ballot measure campaign committee
2 simultaneously affects the exercise of fundamental First
3 Amendment rights in a number of ways.

The effects can best

4 be viewed as two sides of the same coin.
5

On the one hand, ballot measure contribution

6 limits impair the ability of citizens to associate together,
7 to communicate their message to the voters as effectively as
8 possible on an issue of public importance.

On the other

9 hand, these limits under attack here deprive the public of
10 vitally needed information and restrict their access to the
11 marketplace of ideas at the time when they need it most,
12 when they are being asked to decide issues for themselves.
13

The sole and only purpose of a ballot measure

14 contribution is to purchase or enhance communication of the
15 message to the voters.

The sole and only purpose of a

16 limitation on ballot measure contributions to limit or to
17 restrict that vital communication.
18

QUESTION*

How do you distinguish your case from

19 the First National Bank v. Bellotti?
20

MB. PARRINELLOi

Your Honor, I believe that in our

21 case, it's very similar to First National Bank of Boston v.
22 Bellotti because there the court held that in the context of
23 a ballot measure compaign, there is no legitimate
24 governmental interest to support restrictions on First
25 Amendment rights in the form of campaign spending.

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

If anything, the restrictions here are more

2 onerous than the restrictions in Bellotti because they
3 affect the rights of citizens or national persons as well as
4 the rights of corporations,
5

QUESTION;

Counsel, would your argument be the

6 same if the limits were much higher; for instance, $5000
7 instead of $250?
8

HR, PARRINELLOs

Yes, it would. Your Honor.

9 Justice O'Connor, the principal reason that the argument
10 would be the same is that in the context of a ballot measure
11 campaign, there's no legitimate compelling governmental
12 interest to support any restriction on the citizen's ability
13 to communicate,
14

In the context of a ballot measure campaign, a

15 proposal embodied in such a measure, in such a ballot
16 measure, may target any number of citizens' rights.

And the

17 ability of citizens to communicate their ideas with respect
18 to a ballot measure is important to the public’s right to
19 know.
20

It seems to us that there is no legitimate

21 governmental interest to be supported.
22

QUESTION;

Well, is it so much the public’s right

23 to know as it is their right to express what they think?
24

MR. PARRINELLO;

I believe it’s both of those

25 rights, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

Even if it doesn't communicate very

2 much, your position would be it's still a right, even if
3 they present such a muddled message that no one gets it.
4

MR. PARRINELLO:

That's absolutely correct, we

5 agree with that.
6

QUESTION:

Does the state grant any quid quo pro

7lifce limited liability as they did in the case of First
8 National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti here?

Is the liability

9 of members of the CARC limited in the way that the members
10 of a corporation are?
11

MR. PARRINELLO:

Not that I am aware of, Mr.

12 Justice Rehnquist.
13

QUESTION:

They would be liable for acts of their

14 agents and for the same, just as an individual, and they
15 would not have corporate immunity.
16

MR. PARRINELLO:

A corporation in California?

17

QUESTION:

No, CARC, or your Citizens Against Rent

QUESTION:

They would be responsible for the acts

18 Control.
19

20 of the association, that's correct.

Although it would

21 frankly be unlikely that they would be held responsible for
22 such acts.
23

QUESTION:

But that's as a matter of likelihood of

24 the acts taking place, rather than any principle of law that
25 insulates them from acts of individuals.

MR. PARRINELLO

2

The purpose of a ballot measure campaign committee

I believe that’s correct

3 is to express the community of interest or the joint
4 political beliefs of the contributors or association
5 members.

In today's society, as this Court has noted,

6 speech or communication costs money, and it is the pooling
7 of individual resources in the form of campaign
8 contributions to a ballot measure committee that enhances
9 the effectiveness of that communication.
10

Ballot measures are often complex and post complex

11 issues, which if enacted will have effects that are unknown
12 to the average voter, or are difficult for the average voter
13 to perceive.

These effects are best ascertained by

14 research, which is best purchased by committees which have
15 the ability to conduct that research through the resources
16 gained by the pooling of their contributors’ contributions.
17

The committee then communicates to the voters the

18 results of that research, together with data, facts,
19 opinions and reasoning of its contributors for a single
20 purpose; to advocate the passage or the rejection of a
21 ballot measure.

These communications in today's society

22 cost money; they take the form of mailings, newspaper
23 advertisements, television or other media advertising.
24

This ballot measure contribution limit, by

25 restraining that form of communication, imposes substantial

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 restraints upon the exercise of First Amendment rights.
2 Ballot measures often deal with issues and ask the voter to
3 decide issues which affect the property, private property
4 rights, which affect the community in which we live.
5 Indeed, these types of ballot measures often touch people's
6 lives directly.
7
8 democracy.

The ballot measure process is a form of direct
It is where the citizens decide for themselves

9 issues of public importance.

Citizens in this form of

10 democracy act as legislators, but they do not have the
11 resources available to them that legislators have to
12 determine whether or not to approve or reject certain
13 proposed laws, because they do not have legislative staff
14 and staff expertise.
15

It is particularly in the context of a ballot

16 measure compaign where the citizens have to decide important
17 issues for themselves that it is important for them to have
18 free access to all competing points of views.

Any

19 restriction on that access to information cannot be
20 justified, particularly in the context of a ballot measure
21 campaign where First Amendment rights deserve perhaps the
22 greatest protection.
23

Ballot measures are inanimate.

Unlike a

24 candidate, they have no voice and they have no personality.
25 As a result, ballot measures often suffer from low

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 visibility.

In this context, a ballot measure campaign

2 committee is the agent and voice of its contributors and
3 members for a single purpose; to communicate a message to
4 the voters to vote for or against the proposal contained in
5 the ballot measure.
6

The City of Berkeley argues that even though

7 citizens may be limited by this contribution limit — that's
8 $250.oo — that those same citizens may spend money as much
9 as they desire to communicate their views, so long as the
10 citizens spend that money independently of all others.

But

11 it is not what First Amendment rights Berkeley has allowed
12 the citizens to continue to exercise; it is what they have
13 taken away.

And the right that a contribution limit takes

14 away is perhaps the only effective means that most citizens
15 have to participate in the ballot measure compaign process.
16 That is the right to contribute.
17

A simple example will illustrate this point.

The

18 largest single contributor to the committee here contributed
19 $50 00•

That $5000, if spent independently, would have been

20 able to purchase less than a third, approximately a third,
21 of a single mailing to all the voters in the City of
22 Berkeley at the time of this 1977 election.

Because as the

23 record indicates, a single mailing to all Berkeley
24 registered voters at the time of this election cost almost
25 $13 ,000.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

So what we are saying is that the exercise of this

2 right to independently campaign or to have unlimited
3 expenditures is a right that only the very wealthy citizens
4 can enjoy.

And indeed, there are very few other citizens

5 who even though they possess that right can exercise it.
6

I would like to, by way of example, show two other

7 effects of this ballot measure contribution limit.
8

Such a limit would prohibit two Berkeley citizens

9 who share a common view for or against a ballot measure from
10 spending $300 each to purchase a newspaper ad, where each of
11 those two citizens advocates the passage or defeat of a
12 ballot measure.

The limit would prohibit 20 citizens from

13 spending $600 each to purchase the postage and writing
14 materials and printing materials necessary for those 20
15 citizens to send the informational pamphlet to Berkeley
16 voters, communicating their joint interest in opposing or
17 supporting a ballot measure.
18

The net effect and purpose, the net effect of a

19 contribution limit such as this will ultimately frustrate

20 people from participating in the political process because
21 it takes away from them the only effective means that they
22 have to participate, particularly in the context of a ballot
23 measure.
24

QUESTIONS

Of course, a lot of your arguments,

25 counsel, are equally applicable to candidate campaigns.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

But

1 you’re stressing really the ballot measures.
2

MR. PARRINELLOi

That’s correct, Your Honor, our

3 arguments are applicable to candidate campaigns.

The

4 distinction between the ballot measure campaign and the
5 candidate campaign is that there is no governmental interest
6 of vital importance that is served by a ballot measure
7 contribution limit; no logical connection between a ballot
8 measure contribution and its target — the restriction of
9 the flow of communication to the voters — and any
10 compelling governmental interest.

As this Court has

11 indicated in Buckley, there is such a nexus or a compelling
12 governmental interest with respect to candidate contribution
13 limits.
14

QUESTION:

Well, the California Supreme Court

15 purported to find a compelling interest, or several of
16 them.
17

What do you have to say to their views?
MR. PARRINELLOi

Justice White, the California

18 Supreme Court's findings of compelling interests were, in
19 sum, I believe two, which is that the government, the
20 contribution limit sustains the integrity or promotes the
21 integrity of the ballot measure process and promotes an
22 alert citizenry.

23

QUESTION:

And avoids the appearance of money

24 dominating the campaign.

That’s the same -- the other side

25 of the coin.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. PARRINELLOs

Correct.

The other side of that

2 coin.
3

With respect to the appearance of money dominating

4 the campaign, all the California Supreme Court and the
5 Appellees are saying is that — to recognize what this Court
6 has recognized, which is that money purchases communication
7 or enhances communication in the context of an election
8 campaign.
9 voters.
10

And that communication may be persuasive upon the
Indeed, that’s its purpose.
But as this Court has pointed out, the fact that

11 speech or communication may be persuasive is not a reason to
12 suppress it.
13

And that is something that the California —

QUESTION;

You’re just saying that the First

14 Amendment and our cases just foreclose using those interests
15 as a compelling interest.
16

MR. PARRINELLO*

MR. PARRINELLOs

19 say.
20

I believe that's

Is that what you think
I believe that’s

correct.
our cases -- ?
what the cases

That’s our reading of the cases.
But more importantly, there is no logical

21 connection between a ballot measure contribution limit here
22 whose only target is to restrict speech, and any
23 governmental interest including the promotion of the
24 integrity of the electoral process.

Because as this Court

25 pointed out in its decision in Bellotti, particularly in the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 context of the citizens making their own decision in a
2 referendum or a ballot measure campaign, that is where the
3 citizens need the access, the greatest possible access, to
4 conflicting points of view.

And rather than promoting the

5 integrity of the electoral process, what a ballot measure
6 contribution limit does by restricting speech is to
7 denigrate or diminish the integrity of that process
8 ultimately.
9

The same can be said with respect to the Supreme

10 Court's determination, the California Supreme Court's
11 determination, of a compelling interest in maintaining an
12 alert citizenry.

It's illogical to say that by restricting

13 information and communication on a vital issue of public
14 importance that that promotes an alert citizenry.

How can

15 the deprivation of information to the citizens promote and
16 inform the alert citizenry?

We believe that there is no

17 logical connection between a ballot measure contribution
18 limit, whose only effect is to reduce speech, and any
19 governmental interest.
20

QUESTION:

Of course, Bellotti wasn't a

21 contribution case, was it?
22

MR. PARRINELLO:

Bellotti, the issue posed in

23 Bellotti was whether or not contributions or expenditures
24 could be prohibited completely.
25

QUESTION:

Well, what was involved was

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 expenditures, wasn’t it?
2

HR. PARRINELLO:

I believe the issue was

3 contributions or expenditures.

But whether I’m right or

4 wrong in my recollection —
5

QUESTION:

The big argument in the case was

6 whether business entities could spend money on matters in
7 which their property interests or corporate interests
8 weren't directly involved.

And certainly, the Berkeley

9 ordinance doesn't prevent expenditures by corporations or
10 individuals in any amount, does it?
11

MR. PARRINELLOs

No, it doesn’t prevent

12 expenditures, but what it does is to limit the ability of
13 citizens to associate together by the pooling of their
14 resources.
15

QUESTION:

I understand that, but it just isn't

16 covered by Bellotti.
17

MR. PARRINELLO:

Our view is that the principles

18 in Bellotti, while perhaps not on all fours, do cover this
19 case in that in Bellotti, the court dealt with a restriction
20 on spending in the context of a ballot measure campaign, and
21 this case involves a ballot measure campaign as well.

I

22 agree that it’s not all fours with Bellotti, but we believe
23 the principles of Bellotti.

24

It is important to distinguish this case between

25 ~~ to distinguish ballot measure contributions and

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 contributions to candidate campaigns.

A limitation on a

2 contribution to a candidate prevents corruption, prevents
3 the contributor from gaining or appearing to gain undue
4 influence over the candidate.

In effect, money buys

5 allegiance, and large contributions have the threat to
6 purchase the allegiance or to purchase undue influence over
7 a particular candidate, and to cause that candidate, once he
8 or she assumes public office, to elevate the interests of
9 the large contributor above the interests of the candidate's
10 constituency, and thereby subvert the will of the people.
11

QUESTION:

Well, could you tell me whether this

12 committee, when it received money, could independently
13 determine how to spend it?
14

MS. PARRINELLO*

Tour Honor, under California law,

15 the committee is in a fiduciary or trustee position with its
16 contributors so that it can only spend the money for the
17 purpose of advocating the passage or defeat of the ballot
18 measure.

It could not spend the money for the purpose of

19 giving it to a candidate, for example.
20

QUESTION:

I understand that, but what it said and

21 the particular content is decided by the committee.
22

NR. PARRINELLOt

23

QUESTION*

That's correct.

You don't run it by any contributor to

24 see if he agrees with it.
25

MR. PARRINELLO*

It depends upon how the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 particular committee is formed, but —
2

QUESTION;

Well, I'm asking about this one.

3

MR. PARRINELLOi

This particular committee had

4 approximately 125 people on a steering committee, which
5 basically decided the manner in which the campaign was going
6 to be run.
7

QUESTIONS

That may be, but it was the committee's

8 decision , not the contributors'.
9

MR. PARRINELLOs

That's correct, except that under

10 the law in California the committee had to spend the money
11 for the purpose of advocating the defeat of this proposed
12 ballot measure in Berkeley.
13

QUESTION;

14

MR. PARRINELLOs

Or support it.
Well, in this particular case it

15 was —
16

QUESTIONS

It was organized to defeat it.

17

QUESTION;

That's correct.

18

QUESTION;

I know, but the particular content of

19 the communications were decided by the committee.
20

MR. PARRINELLOs

That's correct.

So with the

21 proviso that the committee had to spend the money for the
22 purposes of advocating the defeat of the measure.
23

QUESTIONS

Was it Proposition 13 that related to

24 the tax limitation in your state —
25

MR. PARRINELLOs

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTIONS

And these limits would apply on that

2 kind of a referendum, too,

would it not?

3

They would apply if the state of

MR. PARRINELLO:

4 California enacted them.

At the present time, there are no

5 such limits on the state level but there are bills pending
6 in the legislature.
7

QUESTION:

But I'm speaking of the principle

8 underlying this particular measure would have barred
9 individual citizens from contributing over $250.
10

MR. PARRINELLO;

That is absolutely correct.

11

The City of Berkeley also advocates that the

12 governmental interest in disclosure is served by a ballot
13 measure contribution limit.

But at the present time and in

14 1977, the City of Berkeley had in effect perhaps the most
15 stringent disclosure laws in the nation.

If the City of

16 Berkeley decides or deems that if existing disclosure laws
17 are not sufficient to meet its purposes it can draft
18 narrowly-restrictive disclosure laws which directly serve
19 the purpose of disclosure, but the government interest in
20 promoting disclosure cannot be served by suppressing speech,
21 which is what this ballot measure contribution limit
22 ultimately does.
23

The only purpose of a ballot measure contribution

24 limit is to equalize the relative voices of different
25 segments of our society.

But the concept that government

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 may restrict the voices of some to equalize the voice of
2 others is formed in the First Amendment.

The decision of

3 the California Supreme Court is contrary to precedents of
4 the United States Courts of Appeals for the Second, the
5 Fifth and the Ninth Circuits of the Michigan Supreme Court
6 and of appellate courts in Texas and California.
7

These courts, in scrutinizing ballot measure

8 spending and contribution restrictions, state! that in the
9 context of a ballot measure campaign where the only purpose
10 of a contribution was to enhance communication, that there
11 is no compelling governmental interest, no justifiable
12 interest, to warrant the suppression of vital First
13 Amendment rights.
14
15 reversed.

The decision below is erroneous and it should be
The sole purpose and effect of a ballot measure

16 contribution limit is to restrict political communication
17 because it may be too persuasive.
18

QUESTION:

Would this argument apply to restrict a

19 newspaper from having an editorial, the space of which would

I honestly don't know the answer

It's one I hadn't thought of.

But it

9 could well under those circumstances.
10

Because the ballot measure contribution limit is

11 targeted at communication, because its purpose is to limit
12 comm unication, because it perceives that too much
13 communication is evil, we believe there is no compelling
14 governmental interest; indeed, no legitimate governmental
15 purpose, to support a ballot measure contribution limit.

And we respectfully request that the decision

QUESTION;

Counsel, I always ask the attorneys

MR. PARRINELLO;

Mr. Justice Blackmun, in the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATALIE E. WEST, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

21

MS. WEST*

Mr Chief Justice, may it please the

22 Court, this case is not Bellotti.

As Justice White

23 recognized, in Bellotti, the court’s analysis was directed
24 at the prohibition of expenditures.

25 limitation.

This is a contribution

Expenditures are not restricted in any way.

QUESTION;

Well, they’re restricted by the

2 contributions, aren't they?
3

MS. WEST;

No, Your Honor, every

How can you spend more than you receive?

MS. WEST;

You're speaking then of the campaign

6 committee which
7

QUESTION;

The voice can only be as loud and as

8 pervasive as the contributions permit.
9

MS. WEST;

Is that not so?

You're speaking of the campaign

10 committee which, under a contribution limitation, must raise
11 more funds from a greater number of people.

That does not

12 limit the speech which the campaign committee can engage
13 in.

In fact, it furthers an important democratic interest

14 because it broadens the base of the campaign committee by
15 requiring them to seek contributions from more -16

QUESTION;

Doesn't that fly in the face of one of

17 the rationales of our Buckley v. Valeo opinion, that in
18 order to have more different voices heard, we would suppress
19 — at least according to the court of appeals here — we
20 would suppress some voices in order that more could be heard?
21

MS. WEST;

No, Justice Rehnguist, I think that

23 what the Court was espousing in Buckley.

1 expenditures
2

I'd like to pick up for a moment on some of the

3 points made by appellant in his opening remarks.

In

4 appellants’ reply brief and in their statements today, they
5 demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference
6 between expenditures and contributions.
7

The distinction between a campaign contribution

8 and a campaign expenditure turns on who controls the
9 speech.

If I take $200 and get together with a friend who's

10 got $200 and we buy an ad in the newspaper, that is an
11 expenditure.

That is not limited or restricted in any way

12 by the Berkeley ordinance.

The Berkeley ordinance restricts

13 contributions, and as this Court has recognized in Buckley
14 and in your recent decision of California Medical
15 Association, quote, "contribution limitations impose a far
16 less of an impact on protected rights."
17

QUESTION*

Except in your first example, you would

18 have to agree with your friend as to the form of the
19 advertisement, would you not?
20

MS. WEST*

That's correct, that together we would

21 develop a joint communication, a joint message, and that is,
22 again, enhancing a very basic principle of democracy; to try
23 to increase and expand participation by individuals in the
24 process.

That's one of the things that the Berkeley

25 ordinance seeks to do.

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

3s. West, under that argument, would it

2 comply with the ordinance for a $5000 contributor to say, I
3 want to approve all the advertising that you disseminate,
4 and then they let him do it.

In exchange for $5000 he gets

5 a veto on the advertisement.
6

MS. WEST;

I think that that still would remain a

7 contribution. Justice Stevens, if the —
8

QUESTION*

Why wouldn't it be a joint expenditure?

9

MS. WEST*

A joint expenditure is if you have some

10 control in the content and the time, place and manner of the
11 communication.
12

QUESTION*

Let's say he gets all those controls in

13 exchange for $5000 —
14

MS. WEST*

Then you go over the limit, the line,

15 and it probably becomes an expenditure.

I'd like to point

16 out that under federal law, this exact same kind of
17 line-drawing has taken place as the FEC has adopted
18 regulations to distinguish independent expenditures which
19 are exempt from the $1000 campaign contribution limitation
20 from the contributions.

21

QUESTION:

And —

Do you think it's clear under the

22 ordinance that my suggestion would be acceptable to the city
23 fathers?
24

MS. WEST:

If you --

If the $5000 contributors all get

2 money in the pool, but also, we want to pass on the time,

3 place and the forum of all publications.

Then they would

4 say it’s all right?
5

MS. WEST*

If you put in $5000 and you have some

6 control over the content of the message, over the time,
7 place and manner of the communication so that the
8 communication acknowledges your involvement in it, then you
9 -- it becomes an expenditure; it's no longer a contribution.
10

QUESTION;

You think it’s clear that the city

11 fathers would so interpret their ordinance?
12

NS. WEST;

The definition of contribution turns on

13 control, and it’s the same kind of distinction that this
14 Court made in the California Nedical Association case.

The

15 protected element of an expenditure is a disbursement that's
16 made independently in order to engage directly in political
17 speech.
18

QUESTION;

Now are you talking about the

19 definition in Buckley or the definition in the Berkeley
20 ordinance?
21

MS. WEST;

22 comparable.

The two definitions are actually very

I'm talking about the analysis that this Court

23 has followed in order to distinguish -24

No, I'm asking about what the ordinance

2 provided he insisted on control over the — over, you know
3 -- approval of the message that was —
4

BS. WEST;

I want to stress again, it's more than

5 just approval over the message.

It*s some kind of

6 involvement in the time, place and manner.
7

QUESTION:

Well, all of these things.

MS. WEST:

If — yes, it is.

But is it

8 clear —
9

If the individual is

10 engaging in political speech by spending money and helping
11 to determine what the message is and determining where it's
12 going to be dispersed, how it's going to be communicated to
13 the electorate, then it becomes an expenditure and it is not
14 subject to the ordinance.
15

QUESTION;

Well, you’re telling me what Buckley

MS. WEST;

I'm telling you what the situation is

Now, there's nothing in the

19 record of this case that would lead to a different result.
20 There's nothing in the —

Is there anything in the record that

22 shows that you're right?
23

NS. WEST;

Justice Stevens, I would submit that

24 I’m right in order to be —
25

QUESTION;

Well, is there anything in the record

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that shows that they so construe the ordinance?
2

MS. WESTi

But there's nothing in the record to

3 show that they construe it any other way.
4

QUESTION;

No, that’s not my question.

Is there

5 anything in the record to show that they would approve of
6 $5000 contributions as you just described them?
7

MS. WEST;

No, the situation has never arisen.

8 Returning again to the situation that faces us in this case,
9 we are dealing with a contribution limitation which applies
10 in an evenhanded way to all participants in a political
11 campaign.
12

QUESTION;

Ms. West, do you agree that the test to

13 be applied for its validity is a strict scrutiny test?
14

MS. WEST;

That's a very significant question in

15 this case. Justice O’Connor, because a balancing test is the
16 appropriate test.
17

The governmental regulation affects the

18 communicative impact of the speech to some extent; a minor
19 extent but nevertheless to some extent.

But the interests

20 being advanced by the City of Berkeley are themselves First
21 Amendment interests of the highest importance.
22

We are concerned with the integrity of the

23 electoral process, with improving the accuracy of speech,
24 the diversity of political speech.

25

QUESTION;

Would you say the ordinance would fail

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 the so-called strict scrutiny test?
2

MS. WEST*

3 Justice Rehnquist.

I would submit that it wouldn't,
But to follow with Justice O'Connor’s

4 question, then the appropriate test is to balance the impact
5 on protected rights, which is very minor, against the
6 importance of the governmental interests being advanced,
7 which are very significant.
8

QUESTIONS

9 possible.

You say you want as much diversity as

How many newspapers do you have in Berkeley?

MS. WEST;

We have two daily newspapers.

14

Don't you need a whole lot to counteract

But don't you need more than $250 to counteract that?
MS. WEST*

But, Justice Marshall,

the effect of

15 the contribution limitation is to require the campaign
16 committee to receive funds from diverse sources.

In this

17 case. Citizens Against Rent Control received contributions
18 from over 1300 contributors.

A handful of those made

19 contributions in excess of $250.
20

What we're saying is that the vast majority of

21 contributors contribute less than $250.

Those individuals

22 can participate through means of campaign contributions to

QUESTION*

Ms. West, my problem is that in 1981

2 $250 would buy one bumper Sticker, wouldn’t it, about?

I

3 don't think it would even buy the glue for the bumper
4 stickers, would it?
5

MS. WEST*

Justice Marshall, the —

6

QUESTION:

$250 is just about — it isn’t even

7 walking around money.
8

MS. WEST:

The facts of this case show, however,

9 that the campaign committee raised almost $100,000 in
10 contributions of less than $250.

That is the local scene in

11 Berkeley, California.
12

Now there's another very important state interest

13 that’s advanced by this regulation, and that is the state’s
14 interest in disclosure.
15

Pacific Gas L Electric Company can spend all the

16 money it wants to in a Berkeley ballot measure campaign, but
17 it cannot do so under the name of Southwest Berkeley No, No,
18 No on W.

By requiring entities to spend money, who wish to

19 spend money in excess of $250.00 to spend money directly,
20 the city requires the disclosure, and thus better informs
21 the voters, of who is participating in election campaigns.
22

QUESTION*

Ms. West, can't the city accomplish

23 that just as easily and far less restrictively by just
24 saying that anytime you contribute to a group or a fund,
25 that you have to disclose who the contributors really are?

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 I mean, that's far less restrictive, is it not, than the
2 Berkeley ordinance we, in fact, have?

*

3

MS. WESTi

That type of disclosure does not serve

4 the interests that are particularly important in a ballot
5 measure campaign, where unlike a candidate campaign, there's
6 no person that gives identity.

And what the situation that

7 you have, is that campaign committees adopt names like Let's
8 Help Florida, which is a group that seeks to legalize casino
9 gambling —
10

QUESTION:

11 It is this:

Maybe you misunderstand my question.

why can't Berkeley require that every person or

12 entity or corporation that contributes to this entity have
13 to disclose their identities and the amounts of their
14 contributions?
15

MS. WEST:

Well, they do under current disclosure

16 law, but that information is disclosed on campaign
17 disclosure statements that are filed by the committee before
18 the election.
19

What we submit here is that —

QUESTION:

But can't Berkeley require a different

20 method of disclosure and a different timing, so that you can
21 achieve your goal in a less restrictive fashion?
22

MS. WEST:

We’ve tried to design some approaches

23 that would achieve that goal. Justice O'Connor, and I don’t

24 think that we can appropriately do so.
25

Let me just discuss some possible examples.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

We

1 thought one approach would be to require the disclosure of
2 the big contributors as part of the communication.

But then

3 you get to a point where the disclosure# in fact, overwhelms
4 the communication.

For example, in this case, imagine a

5 30-second radio spot that ends up by saying it’s financed by
6 Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing,
7 California Association of Realtors, Mason-McDuffie Company,
8 Berkeley Board of Realtors, Apartment Political Act and
9 Committee, Mayor Monte Company, B.G. Management
10 Company,Southern Alameda County Board of Realtors.
11

The disclosure is part of the content in a

12 campaign context, and this Court recognized that in
13 Bellotti.

Striking down the prohibition against corporate

14 expenditures, the Court pointed out that corporate
15 advertising is likely to be highly visible, that the
16 corporate identity will help the voters evaluate the source
17 of the message to make a well-informed decision.

That's the

18 goal that we're trying to achieve in this case.
19

Sow another disclosure possibility would be to

20 enact an ordinance that would require the campaign committee
21 to state the title of the message and its position on the
22 measure, and that would avoid the problem with the act of
23 misrepresentation.

But nevertheless, it doesn't further the

24 disclosure because all you get is something along the lines
25 of Committee for Smoking and Non-Smoking Sections, No on 5,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 but you don't know who it is
2

k

So I would submit that in fact the city has

3 considered disclosure alternatives, and we have not been

T

4 able to identify an alternative that serves the -- furthers
5 the purpose in a content-neutral way in the way that this
6 type of a limitation does.
7
8 law?
9

QUESTION*

Nay I ask about present California

Does it require no pre-election disclosure?
MS. WEST;

There are — no, California law

10 requires two campaign disclosure statements to be filed
11 before the election by the committee.
12

QUESTION*

Does the City of Berkeley have any

13 present pre-election disclosure laws?
14

MS. WEST;

It's the same.

15

QUESTION*

And what does the ordinance at issue

16 here today add to that?
17

MS. WEST*

The ordinance required by imposing a

18 $250 limitation, the ordinance serves a disclosure purpose
19 by requiring the contemporaneous disclosure of the source of
20 the communication.
21

I’d like to pick up on this Southwest Berkeley No,

22 No —
23

QUESTION*

If someone wants to give more than $250

24 or spend more than $250, he has to spend it himself.

And

25 then when he spends it, at the time he spends it the source

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 will be disclosed
2
3 you.

MS. WEST;

That’s what you mean, right?
Yes.

I'm sorry, Justice White.

Thank

And then to move on, the point I was going to make is

4 to demonstrate how significant a part disclosure, the
5 contemporaneous disclosure can play in the evaluation of the
6 message, you remember from my brief in a 1974 ballot
7 measure, Pacific Gas £ Electric company funneled over $7000
8 into a committee called Southwest Berkeley No, No, No on W.
9 Southwest Berkeley is in the flatlands adjacent to
10 Emoryville and Oakland.

It’s the poorest section of town

11 with a high minority population.
12

The connotation of a communication that's labeled

13 Southwest Berkeley No, No, No on W is entirely different
14 from the connotation of Pacific Gas & Electric.

I would

15 submit -- and we certainly acknowledge -- that Pacific Gas £
16 Electric can participate to the fullest extent in Berkeley
17 campaigns, but that it helps the voter evaluate the
18 communication when the source of that communication is made
19 immediately available.
20

QUESTIONS

Well, couldn't the city require that

21 the communication put on, this ad paid for by Pacific Gas £
22 Electric?
23

MS. WEST:

As I stated to Justice O'Connor,

24 there's a real problem there.

In that particular instance

25 we could have done that because there’s only one.

That was

34
'

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 only one entity; it was, in fact, a front for one entity.
2 But if there are a number of entities funneling substantial
3 amounts of money into the campaign committee then the
4 disclosure can actually overwhelm the message, as it would
5 in this case.

If you were required to rattle down the names

6 of the over $250 contributors each time you made a 30-second
7 radio spot, for example.
8

I don't want to overlook, the very important

9 governmental interest in increasing and expanding voter
10 participation in election campaigns.

The contribution

11 limitation seeks to achieve that goal in a number of ways.
12

First, campaign committees that are going to raise

13 money and participate in local campaigns must raise funds
14 from a greater number of persons.

This has a very direct

15 impact in broadening the base of support and participation
16 in ballot measure campaigns.
17

Second, individuals who care to participate in a

18 campaign by spending more than $250 must do so by making
19 direct expenditures, not contributions.

This increases the

20 range and diversity of ideas that are expressed in the
21 marketplace of ideas; that in fact furthers the governmental
22 interest to promote involvement with citizens in helping
23 them understand the issues that they're being called upon

24 debate.
25

We're not seeking to stifle debate in this case.

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

to

1 We’re not seeking to cut off voices.

What the City of

2 Berkeley is trying to do is to make the initiative as
3 representative of a broad base of people as possible, to
4 provide information to the voters so that they can
5 understand the diverse issues that are present in a ballot
6 measure campaign.
7

I would submit that this is enough of an interest

8 and enough of a showing to support what the city is trying
9 to do here with its contribution limitation .
10

The Court’s decision in the case of California

11 Medical Association is particularly instructive because the
12 Court made it clear that — the plurality opinion -- that
13 contributions are far less of an infringement on protected
14 rights than expenditures.

Now using the appropriate

15 balancing test, the governmental restriction here can be
16 supported by the interests that I have stated.
17

In Bellotti, this Court referred to the showing by

18 the state of Massachusetts and indicated that Massachusetts
19 had made no showing that the voice of corporations was
20 overwhelming or even significant in ballot measure
21 campaigns.

That particular sentence has been picked up and

22 repeated by most of the courts that have considered the
23 validity of contribution prohibitions and limitations in the
24 ballot measure context.

And I would submit that that is an

25 over-broad reading of that sentence in Bellotti.

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Again, Bellotti was looking at expenditure

2 limitations, and that sentence implies that if you had
3 evidence that the referenda
4 significantly impacted

process was being overwhelmed or

by corporate expenditure, that you

5 might even be able to support an expenditure limitation.
6 Here we're dealing only with a contribution limitation.
7

But if the Court wants to impose that strong a

8 standard and require a

showing that large contributions are

9 overwhelming the political process and

are causing some

10 improper functioning of the initiative process,
11 data beginning to evolve which

there are

shows that that may, in fact,

12 be true, that very large campaign contributions channeled
3 into the political process do not educate the voters, do not
4 inform the voters.
5

QUESTIONS

Ms. West, is there any evidence in the

6 record in this case for that proposition, or to support
7 allegation that voters'

the

perceptions are being affected?

8 are these just assumptions made on

Or

the basis of some social

9 science articles?
20

MS. WEST;

At the time of the trial court decision

21 in this case there had not been the appropriate
22 documentation because most of this depends on campaign
23 disclosure laws that became vigorously enforced in the
24 mid-seventies,

so that we've actually seen an emerging of

25 some documentation in the form of

the social science

1 studies, just very recently.

One of the first very complete

2 studies is one which is still in draft and will be published
3 in the spring in the UCLA Law Review, which I have furnished
4 to the appellants and to the Court in draft form.

That's a

5 comprehensive study by Professor Daniel Lowenstein of
6 California Ballot Measures for 1968 through 1980, in which
7 he concludes that there are a number of instances in which
8 the outcome of ballot measure campaigns has been determined
9 by very large amounts of money funneled into a single
10 campaign committee that conveyed only a very narrow message
11 to the electorate.
12

QUESTION*

Is the city's motivation in part, then,

13 to, in effect, muzzle the contributors with deep pockets to
14 enhance the relative voting strength of those with less
15 money, would you say?
16

MS. WEST*

No, that's not, Justice O’Connor.

I

17 think at the time this ordinance was passed and similarly,
18 at the time that the state act was passed, which was in the
19 summer of 1974, that was before this Court's decision in
20 Buckley.

And at that time, I believe there was a thinking

21 that that sort of equalization theory underlies some of the
22 parts of the statute.

But in the aftermath of Buckley, we

23 recognized that equalization is not an appropriate goal, and
24 that's where the expenditure limitations were invalidated,

25 both the local and the state expenditure limitations.

38

1

We’re now left with a situation which is very

2 comparable to the federal situation; a limitation on
3 contributions and no limitation on expenditures.

And we

4 submit that in this situation, there are other state
5 interests, completely unrelated to anything to do with
6 equalizing or muzzling, which more than support the very
7 important impact that this contribution limitation has on
8 the political process.
9

QUESTION;

What authorities do you look to to say

10 that we shouldn’t apply a strict scrutiny here?
11

MS. WEST;

The Court had used a balancing standard

12 in Buckley and in Bellotti, and those are the two cases that
13 I think should govern this Court's interpretation of the
14 standard, of course, and the California Medical Association
15 opinion as well.
16

QUESTION;

May I ask you a question about the

17 Lowenstein study?
18

MS. WEST;

Yes.

19

QUESTION;

You point out in your footnote on page

20 11 of your brief that when the money — one-sided spending
21 in support of a proposition, it comes out about 50/50, that
22 half the time it's successful and half it isn't.

Then you

23 have a footnote that says on the other hand, of the ten

24 propositions opposed by significant one-sided spending, none
25 were defeated.

QUESTIONS

MS. WESTs

I was just going to point out that, of

10 you're being asked to do really are notice legislative facts
11 and not make a finding of a judicial fact.

QUESTION;

14

QUESTIONS

It's important to remember that this

15 was an initiative measure.

It was passed by the people, so

16 to the extent that it reflects the people's perceptions of

18 give that the greatest deference, as is appropriate to the
19 interpretation of initiative measures.

1

MS. WEST

On the basis of the information set

2 forth in oar brief and the arguments that we've made today,
3 I think it's clear that the Berkeley ordinance imposes a
4 relatively minor infringement on protected rights; in fact,
5 almost no infringement on protected rights.

Individuals'

6 ability to make contributions may be somewhat limited, their
7 ability to make campaign expenditures is not restricted in
8 any way.
9

That minor restriction is more than offset by

10 governmental interests of the very highest importance, and I
11 would urge that this Court affirm the decision of the
12 California Supreme Court.
13

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Do you have

You have four minutes

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. PARRINELLO, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF APPLICANTS — REBUTTAL

18

MR. PARRINELLO;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

The Berkeley definition of a contribution does not

20 turn upon who controls the contribution.

Section 205 of the

21 Berkeley ordinance, which appears in the Jurisdictional
22 Statement Appendix at A-60 defines committee — and I will
23 paraphrase, but it defines committee as any person or
24 combination of persons that directly or indirectly makes
25 expenditures exceeding more than $250 in a calendar year for

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the
2 action of voters for or against the passage of a ballot
3 measure.
4

The Berkeley ordinance in Section 206, again on

5 page 60 of Jurisdictional Statement Appendix, defines
6 contributions to that committee as a gift, subscription,
7 loan, advance or anything of value made directly or
8 indirectly in aid of or in opposition to a ballot measure.
9

The very example which I stated to the Court about

10 the two people wishing to buy a newspaper ad and spend £600
11 to do so is directly covered by this ordinance, because
12 those two people are a combination of persons who equal a
13 committee which, by purchasing that newspaper ad, are making
14 an indirect expenditure.
15

QUESTION:

But the city attorney tells us that's

16 an incorrect reading of the ordinance.
17

MR. PARRINELLO:

I appreciate that, but there is

18 nothing in the ordinance that states — and the law is a
19 matter for the Court to decide — there is nothing in the
20 ordinance that states —
21

QUESTION:

But it’s not a matter for this Court to

22 interpret state ordinances, is it?
23

MR. PARRINELLO:

24 interpret state ordinances,

It's not for the Court to
I agree, if there's any doubt

25 about the meaning of this particular law.

But the Court

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 does have the right and the power to interpret laws and
2 determine whether they meet constitutional requirements, and
3 this particular law does not.

Because it does impose a

4 direct restraint on those very citizens to associate
5 together in any form to communicate their joint ideas.
6

QUESTION;

Did the city declare a forfeiture here?

7

MR. PARRINELLO*

The city did declare a

8 forfeiture, but the superior court enjoined the forfeiture,
9 and the funds were used in the campaign.
10

QUESTION;

Does the superior court interpret the

11 ordinance one way or the other?
12

MR. PARRINELLO;

As a matter of fact, no, there is

13 nothing in the record to state the manner in which the
14 ordinance was interpreted by the court.

It simply took

15 notice of the limitation and struck it down as being
16 unconstitutional.
17

The city interest in disclosure can be met in

18 several ways which the City of Berkeley has not recognized.
19 At the present time, City of Berkeley law requires the
20 disclosure in pre-election report filings two times before
21 each election of all contributions larger than $250.00, and
22 city law requires that local newspapers publish those
23 contributions in the names of the contributors twice before
24 each election.
25

So to say that the public —

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Could they pay the newspapers for that

2 space?
3

HR. PARRINELLO:

Yes, they could, or they could

4 require the committee, in effect, to pay for more frequent
5 disclosure in local newspapers.
6

But more importantly, the city doesn't say that it

7 has done anything about the apparent or perceived evil it
8 sees in the names of campaign committees, because it says
9 those names are misleading.

Rather than suppress speech,

10 the City of Berkeley can regulate the names of the campaign
11 committees if it desires.

The federal government has done

12 that with respect to candidate campaigns.
13

Thank you.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel, the

15 case is submitted.
