MR. REIN:

Mr. -- Mr. -- General Suter

trained me too well.
Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court,
and may it please the Court:
The central issue here is whether the

15

University of Texas at Austin can carry its burden

16

approving that its use of race as an admissions-plus

17

factor in the consequent denial of equal treatment,

18

which is the central mandate of the Equal Protection

19

Clause, to Abigail Fisher met the two tests of strict

20

scrutiny which are applicable.

First --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rein, before we get

23

to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on

24

its own, the question of -- of standing.

if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas,

and the answer is, no matter what, this person would not

have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the

3

affirmative action program?

4

MR. REIN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the first

5

injury that was before the Court was the use of a system

6

which denied equal treatment.

7

injury, and part of the damage claim was premised

8

directly on the Constitutional issue.

It was a Constitutional

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you get past

Texas v. Lesage with that injury --

11

MR. REIN:

Lesage --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which says that mere

13

use of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for

14

standing.

15

MR. REIN:

Lesage was litigated on its

16

merits, and the question was whether Lesage could carry

17

his case when -- on summary judgment, when it was

18

apparent that his complaint, which was that he was

19

denied access to the graduate program at the University

20

of Texas, was not sustainable.

As I said -- and there are several factors

in this case that are quite different.

She was considered for the summer program and rejected.

On the -- if we then, on remand,

17

were to assert damages contingent upon the fact that she

18

should have been admitted to UT and was not admitted, we

19

would then have to prove that, but for the use of race,

20

she would be admitted.

21

That's the thrust of Lesage.

Whether we can prove it or can't prove it is

something you can't tell on this record.

If you are going to the --

to the merits, I want to know whether you want us to --

Grutter said it

10

that time flies, but I think only nine of those years

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so, are you?

And, if

14

so, why overrule a case into which so much thought and

15

effort went and so many people across the country have

16

depended on?

1

interest; what does a critical mass --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So your question is

3

whether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter?

4

Is that what you're arguing?

5
6

MR. REIN:

We litigated it on that basis,

yes.

Well, how do you want to

argue it right now in the next ten minutes?

interested because I have a very short time to get my

10

question out, and I need to know how you are going to

11

argue it.

12

MR. REIN:

I'm

Well, Justice Breyer, our

13

argument is we can satisfy Grutter if it's properly

14

read.

What we've seen -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

May I ask you on that

16

specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution.

17

Suppose the only plan were the one that is before the

18

Court now, no 10 percent.

19

that the University is attempting to increase minority

20

enrollment.

21
22
23

This is the exclusive way

Then, if we had no 10 percent solution,
under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable?
MR. REIN:

Well, I think that there would be

24

flaws under Grutter, even if you assumed away something

25

that can't be assumed away because it is a matter of
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Texas law, that is, there is a top 10 percent program,

2

and that --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then the -- the

4

question is can you have both?

5

this program is certainly no more aggressive than the

6

one in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest.

7
8
9

MR. REIN:

But it seems to me that

Well, I don't agree with that,

and let me explain why.
In order to satisfy Grutter, you first have

10

to say that you are not just using race gratuitously,

11

but it is in the interest of producing a critical mass

12

of otherwise underrepresented students.

13

be within Grutter framework, the first question is,

14

absent the use of race, would we be generating a

15

critical mass?

16

And so to -- to

To answer that question, you start -- you've

17

got to examine in context the so-called soft factors

18

that are in Grutter -- you know, are -- is there an

19

isolation on campus?

20

they cannot speak out?

21

Do members of minority feel that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The one social studies

22

that this University did said that minority students,

23

overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are

24

feeling isolated.

25

under your test?

So what do -- why isn't that even

We can go back to whether substantial

2

evidence is adequate, is necessary, or not.

7

It's not reported in any systematic way.

They

And it was all about

It wasn't about --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was it -- was it done

before or after they announced the decision to

10

reinstitute racial --

11

MR. REIN:

It was done after

12

President Faulkner had made the declaration they were

13

going to do it.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which came almost

immediately after our decision in Grutter.

16
17

It was done before --

MR. REIN:

On the -- I believe, on the same

day.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And by the way, do you

19

think that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's

20

question -- do you think that Grutter held that there is

21

no more affirmative action in higher education after

22

2028?

23

MR. REIN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

No, I don't.
Was that the holding of

Grutter?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a scary -- that's a

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree it might, but I

3

That was -- that was not --

scary --

4
5

want to get to the question, so, what I'm trying to

6

pinpoint, because we have such a limited time, and to

7

me, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're

8

arguing on that this satisfies Grutter, if properly

9

understood, as you say that.

10

In looking up, we have a

two-court rule.

11

And two courts have found, it seems to me,

12

that here, there is a certain thing -- there is no

13

quota.

14

was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral

15

means.

16

consideration, and race did not become the predominant

17

factor.

18

It is individualized.

It is time limited.

It

Each applicant receives individual

So I take those as a given.

And then I want

19

to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in

20

your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in

21

that it was not satisfied here?

22

courts say are the same.

23
24
25

MR. REIN:

The ones I listed, two

So maybe there's some others.

I'm not sure we agree with those

courts in their method of analysis.
JUSTICE BREYER:

But we have a rule that if

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something

2

connected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's

3

why I mention that.

4

MR. REIN:

Well -- and -- particularly in

5

the case of considering alternatives that have worked

6

about as well, I think that's a legal question this

7

Court is free to act on.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are facts, and there

10
11

are facts, aren't there?
MR. REIN:

So if I might try to answer your

12

question, there was no effort in this case to establish

13

a -- even a working target for critical mass.

14

simply ignored it.

15

we've got to do more.

16

predicate question, which Grutter asks:

17

of race, can we generate a critical mass?

They just used words, and they said,
So they never answered the

So -- I mean, that's -- that's a flaw we

19

think is in Grutter.

21

They

We think it's necessary for this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, whether that --

That -- that's a normal

22

fact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether

23

there is -- is or is not a critical mass?

24

MR. REIN:

No.

I --

fact.

2

MR. REIN:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

it?

And I'm -- I'm not saying --

A judgment?

5

MR. REIN:

Well, Justice Scalia, that is

6

correct.

7

whether a critical mass --

And in addition, the courts didn't find

8
9

It's an estimation, isn't

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
what a critical mass was?

So could you tell me

I'm looking at the number of

10

blacks in the University of Texas system.

11

when the state was indisputably still segregating, it

12

was 4 percent.

13

it's 6 percent.

14

you, even though the state population is at 12 percent?

15

Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the

16

2 percent increase?

17

Pre-Grutter,

Today, under the post-Grutter system,
The 2 percent increase is enough for

MR. REIN:

Well, we don't believe that

18

demographics are the key to underrepresentation of

19

critical mass.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

No -- putting aside -- I

21

don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that, if

22

demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat

23

concerned.

24

demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in

combination with how isolated or not isolated your

MR. REIN:

split out subgroups of minorities, you mistake, I

think -- what I think is the proper thrust of Grutter,

5

or at least ought to be.

It might be insulting --

Why -- why don't you

Why don't you seriously suggest

10

that demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the

11

state has nothing to do with whether somebody feels

12

isolated, that if you're in a state that is only

13

1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not

14

isolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?

19

balancing is not a permissible interest.

21

certainly agree with.

23

And we have

And that is something we

Trying to respond to Justice Sotomayor

24

and -- and in the framework of Grutter, what you're

25

looking at is, do you -- does this person, member of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

so-called underrepresented minority -- it's a concept we

2

don't necessarily accept, but it's Texas' concept -- are

3

they isolated?

4

Are they unable to speak out?

And I think we've always said, if you have a

5

very large number, as Texas did in 2004, when they

6

ostensibly made the decision to reinstitute race, they

7

had a 21 percent admission percentage of what they

8

called the underrepresented minorities.

9

They also had about an 18 percent admission

10

ratio of Asian Americans.

11

about -- about 40 percent of the class being minorities.

12

So on campus, you're talking

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, but the test is -- the

13

test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the

14

opinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass

15

is, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out.

16

That's the test.

17

Grutter?

And in your opinion, it was in Grutter?

18
19

MR. REIN:

Yes.

It said expressly in

Grutter --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

it was satisfied there and not here is?

22

MR. REIN:

Isolated.

And the reason

In Grutter, the Court assumed

23

that the very small number of admissions -- minority

24

admissions, looked at as the whole -- and it was looked

25

at as a whole, only as a whole in Grutter -- would have
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

yielded about 3 or 4 percent minority admission in a

2

class of 350, which means about 12 to 15 students --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what are you telling

4

us is the standard of critical mass?

At what point does

5

a district court or a university know that it doesn't

6

have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that

7

has happened in that particular state over decades, that

8

it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has

9

to change its rules.

What's that fixed number?

10

MR. REIN:

We -- it's not our burden to

11

establish the number.

12

University of Texas to determine whether --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It was the burden of the

Well, they told -- they

14

told the district court.

They took a study of students.

15

They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they

16

determined in their educational judgment that greater

17

diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of

18

their educational program and one that includes

19

diversifying classes.

20

So what more proof do you require?

21

MR. REIN:

Well, if you are allowed to state

22

all the grounds that need to be proved, you will always

23

prove them, in all fairness, Justice Sotomayor.

24

The question is, they have --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but given it was

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in the evidence, what more do you think they needed?

2

think I hear all you saying in your brief is the

3

number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is

4

necessary.

5

MR. REIN:

What we're saying in the brief

6

was they were generating, in fact, a very substantial

7

number of minority presence on campus.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. REIN:

11

That's enough now.

And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

I

That's what you're

saying?

12

MR. REIN:

No.

And that immediately thrust

13

upon them the responsibility, if they wanted to -- you

14

know, essentially move away from equal treatment, they

15

had to establish, we have a purpose, we are trying to

16

generate a critical mass of minorities that otherwise

17

could not be achieved.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me -- all right.

19

Tell me what about their use of race did not fit the

20

narrow tailoring -- not the necessity prong as you've

21

defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter

22

required?

23

violated the terms of Grutter?

How is race used by them in a way that

24

MR. REIN:

And for this purpose --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assuming that the need

18
Alderson Reporting Company

is there.

I know you're challenging the need.
MR. REIN:

Well, put -- put aside whether

3

this was necessary and whether it was an appropriate

4

last resort in -- in a quest for diversity and critical

5

mass because Grutter's not without limits.

6

that aside, and let me come directly to your question.

7

But I'll put

tailoring, you can't tailor to the unknown.

what critical mass means, you can't tailor to it.

Well, let me tell you that, if

you look outside the top 10, at the so-called AI/PAI

admits only -- forget the top 10 for a minute, they were

4

generating approximately 15 percent minority admissions

5

outside the top 10, which is in -- above what the target

6

was in Grutter.

7

It's vastly different.

So this is not Grutter on its facts.
This is a --

I thought the 15 percent figure was

MR. REIN:

No.

With the 10 percent plan,

23

it's much higher.

In 2004, it was 21 percent for just

24

Hispanics and African Americans, and these are the

25

categories they used.

If you add in Asians, it was over

Alderson Reporting Company

38 percent.
But I'm isolating -- in response to Justice

3

Ginsburg, I'm isolating to the non-top 10 admissions.

4

Those are over 15 percent in that year, and they average

5

very close to that over time.

6

So the -- the total generation of minority

7

presence is a combination of the two in fact, but the

8

AI/PAI system -- which was adopted in response to

9

Hopwood, it was -- as Texas says, it was the first thing

10

they tried to accommodate to their loss of the ability

11

to use race directly, which came up in Hopwood.

12

So that was their first response, to look at

13

a more balanced admission program between Academic Index

14

and Personal Achievement Index.

15

which just excludes minorities.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it is not a system

Could you comment on

17

this -- and then I hope we can get back to

Justice Alito's question.

19

You argue that the University's

20

race-conscious admission plan is not necessary to

21

achieve a diverse student body because it admits so few

22

people -- so few minorities.

23

that, reading the brief.

probably wrongly excluded.

point?

includes an extension of the 10 percent plan because

5

it's a major generator of minority admissions.

6

right now, that ranges at 30.

MR. REIN:

Uh-huh.

So I just want to make clear the

record doesn't depend -- they don't depend on race to do

10

it.

It's minimal change with the use of race.

And

11

that's why we say there is an alternative, which would

12

serve it about as well in increasing yield or, indeed,

13

in reweighting the -- the PAI, which is a critical

14

element here, so that you put more emphasis on the

15

socioeconomic factors and less emphasis on the essays,

which are an academic measure within the PAI.

If you go to narrow tailoring, what we are

distinction.

13

there are a lot of Asians, it's a demographic measure,

who becomes class president, would get some points

because he has or she has proven that they foster or can

of race.

It's combining that with other factors.

There is a plus because of race.

There are many other factors in the decision.

And might

I say that this -- the white student president of the

11

class in an ethnically different school is a measure of

12

leadership.

Leadership is an independent factor in the

is something they can use to boost the PAI score, the

terms of how it operates in taking race into account as

narrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored

not the need prong -- not the necessity prong.

4

most of his argument has been centered on that, so --

5

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

I think

And so that's the

6

second point I was going to make, which is that the

7

holistic admissions process at issue here is a necessary

8

counterpart to the state's top 10 percent Law and works

9

to systematic -- to offset the systematic drawbacks of

4

This was only one of many information points that the

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

Well, on the classroom

diversity, how does the non-top 10 percent part of the

plan further classroom diversity?

9

that the university had over 5,000 classes that

My understanding is

10

qualified as small, and the total number of African

11

Americans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part

12

of the plan that is challenged was just a little over

13

200.

14

So how does that -- how does that -- how can

15

that possibly do more than a tiny, tiny amount to

16

increase classroom diversity?

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, we didn't look

specifically at that determination.

What we did -- in

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, I don't know the

answer to that question, and let me try to explain why

8

the university didn't look specifically at -- to that.

9

Because at the time that the classroom diversity study

10

was conducted, it was before the holistic admissions

11

process at issue here was adopted in 2003-2004.

12

And so that determination wouldn't have been

as important as just finding out are African Americans

or Hispanics, underrepresented minorities, present at

the university in such numbers that we are not

experiencing racial -- racial isolation in the

I think -- let me

first say that my friends have -- throughout this

seems to me the critical question in this case:

5

didn't the 10 percent solution suffice?

substantial number of minority members admitted as a

7

result of the 10 percent solution.

8

enough to achieve diversity?

9

MR. GARRE:

Why

There were a

Why wasn't that

Well, let me make a couple of

10

points, Your Honor.

First, if you just looked at the

11

numbers -- we don't think it's the numbers, but if you

12

looked at the numbers, after 7 years, racial diversity

13

among these groups at the University of Texas had

14

remained stagnant or worse.

15

enrollment had actually dropped to 3 percent.

16

one part of it.

2002, African American
That's

17

The other part of it is, if you look at the

18

admissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the --

19

the top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high

20

school may get you diversity that looks okay on paper,

21

but it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces

22

educational benefits on campus.

23

considerations that the university took into account as

24

well.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's one of the

I don't understand that.

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Why?

Why -- why doesn't it?

2

MR. GARRE:

Because, Your Honor, as is true

3

for any group -- and the Harvard plan that this Court

4

approved in Bakke specifically recognized this, you

5

would want representatives and different viewpoints from

6

individuals within the same -- the same racial group,

7

just as you would from individuals outside of that.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What kind of viewpoints?

I

mean, are they political viewpoints?
MR. GARRE:

10

Well, anyone's experiences,

11

where they grew up, the situations that they -- that

12

they experience in their lives are going to affect their

13

viewpoints.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This -- this has nothing to

15

do with, with racial diversity.

16

about something else.

17

MR. GARRE:

I mean, you're talking

Your Honor, I think it directly

18

impacts the educational benefits of diversity in this

19

sense, that the minority candidate who has shown that --

20

that he or she has succeeded in an integrated

21

environment, has shown leadership, community service,

22

the other factors that we looked at in holistic review,

23

is precisely the kind of candidate that's going to

24

come -- come on campus, help to break down racial

25

barriers, work across racial lines, dispel -42

stereotypes --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Also, the kind that is

3

likely to be included within the 10 percent rule.

4

incidentally, when -- when was the 10 percent rule

5

adopted?

6

MR. GARRE:

7

But, but with respect to your -- your

And,

1998, Your Honor.

8

factual point, that's absolutely wrong, Your Honor.

If

9

you look at the admissions data that we cite on page 34

10

of our brief, it shows the breakdown of applicants under

11

the holistic plan and the percentage plan.

12

And I don't think it's been seriously

13

disputed in this -- this case to this point that,

14

although the percentage plan certainly helps with

15

minority admissions, by and large, the -- the minorities

16

who are admitted tend to come from segregated,

17

racially-identifiable schools.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought that the

19

whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students

20

who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make

21

a very different argument that I don't think I've ever

22

seen before.

23

The top 10 percent plan admits lots of

24

African Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number

25

of African Americans.

But you say, well, it's -- it's
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

faulty because it doesn't admit enough African Americans

2

and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds.

3

you specifically have the example of the child of

4

successful professionals in Dallas.

5

And

Now, that's your -- that's your argument?

6

If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are

7

-- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your

8

law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another

9

corporate lawyer.

They have income that puts them in

10

the top

11

1 percent of earners in the country, and they have --

12

parents both have graduate degrees.

13

They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an

14

Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely

15

average in terms of education and income?

16

MR. GARRE:

No, Your Honor.

And let me --

17

let me answer the question.

18

comes almost word for word from the Harvard plan that

19

this Court approved in Grutter and that Justice Powell

20

held out in Bakke.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

First of all, the example

Well, how can the answer to

22

that question be no, because being an African American

23

or being a Hispanic is a plus factor.

24
25

MR. GARRE:

Because, Your Honor, our point

is, is that we want minorities from different

backgrounds.

2

from disadvantaged backgrounds.

3

We go out of our way to recruit minorities

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

that what counts is race above all?

5

different experiences --

Well, that's the

8

necessary -- that's the necessary response to

9

Justice Alito's question.
MR. GARRE:

10

Well, Your Honor, what we want

11

is different experiences that are going to -- that are

12

going to come on campus --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You want underprivileged

14

of a certain race and privileged of a certain race.

15

that's race.

16

MR. GARRE:

So

No, Your Honors, it's -- it's

17

not race.

It's just the opposite.

19

take into account differences among members of the same

20

race does a disservice --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, in the LUAC

22

you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of

that race who are privileged can be representative, and

that's race.

judgment?
MR. GARRE:

I think the standard you would

3

apply is the one set forth in Grutter, and it comes from

4

Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, that you would look

5

to whether or not the University reached an environment

6

in which members of underrepresented minorities, African

7

Americans and Hispanics, do not feel like spokespersons

for their race, members -- an environment where

9

cross-racial understanding is promoted, an environment

10

where the benefit -- educational benefits of diversity

11

are realized.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It --

Mr. Garre, before your

14

time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you

15

to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved,

17

racial criteria.

18

MR. GARRE:

19

First I'd point to my friend's

23

own concessions, that the consideration of race has

24

increased racial diversity at Hispanic and helps with

25

minority enrollment.

51

7

factors that appears on the cover of every application,

14

MR. GARRE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think --

You address that in
We have an

And there is another part of

15

that that comes from the brief in opposition, Your

16

Honor, which goes to the relief that she has requested.

17

The declaratory and injunctive release -- relief that

18

this case began with, that request has fallen out, and

19

that's undisputed.

20

this case is a request for monetary damages.

21

request is on page 79 of the Joint Appendix, and it's

22

focused exclusively on a request for the return of

23

admissions fees.

24

to confer standing is that she would have paid the

25

admissions fee no matter what policy the university

So the only thing that is live in
That

And the reason why that is not enough

admissions had.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -- what

3

about our Jacksonville case that said it is an injury to

4

be forced to be part of a process in which there is

5

race-conscious evaluation?

6

MR. GARRE:

Texas v. Lesage says that

7

that -- that injury is not sufficient in a

8

backward-looking case like this, where you only have

9

monetary damages.

In Jacksonville and all the other

10

cases, they involved forward-looking claims for

11

declaratory injunctive reliefs where people who were

12

going to go out and get contracts again.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So Texas --

I thought your

14

friend -- your friend told us that these remedial issues

15

and damages issues had been segregated out of the

16

process and are still available for remand.

17

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, that is not an

18

answer to jurisdiction for this reason:

19

it is bifurcated in the sense that we could go and prove

20

damages, but the complaint makes no doubt that the only

21

request for monetary damages is a request for admissions

22

fees.

23

has said that relief that does not remedy the injury

24

suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into Federal

25

court.

That -- it says that explicitly.

It's true that

perhaps.

Well, that's part of the

It's -- it's not the only injury

5

MR. GARRE:

It's the only --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But she -- she had to pay

7

an admissions fee for a process in which she was not

8

treated fairly.

9

MR. GARRE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11
12

And the reason why -Why shouldn't she get her

money back?
MR. GARRE:

The reason why the payment of

13

that fee doesn't redress the injury, Your Honor, is that

14

she would have paid it even if Texas didn't consider

15

race at all; and, therefore, the payment of the

16

application fee back doesn't remedy the injury that she

17

is complaining about.

18
19
20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you to get -- if

this is easy, do it; if not, don't.
I wanted to use accurate numbers, and so I

21

discovered -- I wanted to find out how many universities

22

actually used a Grutter-type process last year or the

23

year before, etcetera.

24

25

3

so if you can agree on -- simply, roughly -- what that

4

number is, I would like to know it; otherwise, I will --

5

I can use pre-Grutter numbers which are public and

6

available.

7

And you are both here, both sides,

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, I don't have

Obviously, the Ivy Leagues and Little

9

Ivy Leagues that have filed amicus briefs are using it.

10

And this Court recognized in Grutter that the best

universities, many of the best universities in America,

12

have been using these plans for 30 years or more.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

14

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

16
17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

18

In resolving this case, it is important to

19

focus on what is, or more precisely, what is not at

20

issue.

21

Petitioner is not challenging Grutter's

22

reaffirmation of the principle of Justice Powell's

23

opinion in Bakke that student body diversity is a

24

compelling interest that can justify the consideration

25

of race in university admissions.

Colleges and

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

universities across the country have relied on that

2

principle in shaping their admissions policies, and it

3

is of vital interest to the United States that they

4

continue to be able to do so.

5

The core of our interest is in ensuring that

6

the Nation's universities produce graduates who are

7

going to be effective citizens and effective leaders in

8

an increasingly diverse society, and effective

9

competitors in diverse global markets.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Does the United States agree

11

with Mr. Garre that African American and Hispanic

12

applicants from privileged backgrounds deserve a

13

preference?

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I understand that

15

differently, Justice Alito.

Here's how we understand

16

what is going on with respect to the admissions process

17

in the University of Texas, and I am going to address it

18

directly.

19

so.

I just think it needs a bit of context to do

The top 10 percent plan certainly does

20
21

produce some ethnic diversity.

Significant numbers get

in.

diversity in the same way it can with respect to the

24

25 percent of the class that is admitted through the

25

holistic process.

The problem is the university can't control that

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So my understanding of what the university

2

here is looking to do, and what universities generally

3

are looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant

4

a preference for privilege, but to make individualized

5

decisions about applicants who will directly further the

6

educational mission.

7

individuals who will play against racial stereotypes

8

just by what they bring:

9

the Hispanic who has -- who has mastered classical

For example, they will look for

If you have two applicants

13

who are absolutely the same in every respect:

14

22

It's a marginal case.

Under the Texas plan, one gets in; one doesn't

They both

No.

I think the -- in

Do you agree with -- do you

agree that that is an incorrect statement of the facts,

24

or do you agree that that's an incorrect understanding

25

of the Equal Protection Clause?
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think it's both.

I

2

think the -- there is no automatic preference in Texas.

3

And I think this is right in the -- it says at page 398a

4

of the Joint Appendix -- the -- they describe the

5

process as saying, "An applicant's race is considered

6

only to the extent that the applicant, viewed

7

holistically, will contribute to the broader vision of

8

diversity desired by the university."

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but -- but the

10

hypothetical is that the two applicants are entirely the

11

same in all other respects.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

But the point --

And if -- if the ability to

14

give a racial preference means anything at all, it

15

certainly has to mean that, in the -- in the

16

hypothetical given -- given by Justice Alito, the

17

minority student gets in and the other one doesn't.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I disagree,

19

Justice Scalia.

20

clear -- and I think this is a common feature of these

21

kinds of holistic approaches -- that not everyone in an

22

underrepresented group gets a preference, gets a plus

23

factor.

24
25

What the -- Texas, I think, has made

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a matter of not

everyone; it's a matter of two who are identical in all
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other respects.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
And what does the racial

4

preference mean if it doesn't mean that in that

5

situation the minority applicant wins and the other one

6

loses?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There may not be a racial

8

preference in that situation.

It's going to depend on a

9

holistic, individualized consideration of the applicant.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

But, they're already

talking --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just don't understand

13

this argument.

sometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are

saying that it isn't.

Then -- then we should just say you can't use

20

that, Justice Kennedy.

21

Well, then, we should just go

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It can make a difference.

12

It just doesn't invariably make a difference with

13

respect to every minority applicant, and that's the

14

key here --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have to agree

16

that it makes a difference in some cases.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, it does.
Okay.

But it doesn't

20

necessarily make a difference in the situation that

21

Justice Alito posited in the hypothetical --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's the same --

23

the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in

24

some cases it's going to make a difference.

25

would be true under Grutter.

The same

The same would be true

academies.

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That -- that is exactly

4

right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that it's not

5

a mechanical factor.

6

Now, with respect to the implementation

7

of -- and the narrow tailoring inquiry, with respect to

8

the University's implementation of this -- of its

9

compelling interest, I do think it's clear that,

10

although the Petitioner says she's challenging

11

implementation, that this plan meets every requirement

12

of Grutter and addresses the concern of Justice Kennedy

13

that you raised in dissent in Grutter.

And because of the way the process is structured, they

19

do not monitor the racial composition on an ongoing

20

basis.

21

Race is not a mechanical automatic

It's an holistic individualized consideration.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, I think, as I

22

take your answer, is that the supposition of

23

Justice Alito's question is truly impossible under this

24

system.

25

there are not identical mechanical factors that --

There are not two identical candidates because

65
Alderson Reporting Company

except the 10 percent plan.

2

Under the PIA, the factors are so varied, so

3

contextually set, that no two applicants ever could be

4

identical in the sense that they hypothesize.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's correct.

They

6

make specific individualized judgments about each

applicant --

13

14

race into account.

That's the

And the district court found -- and you're

15
16

not challenging -- that race makes a difference in some

17

cases, right?

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

But the key,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, is the way it makes a difference.

20

And it makes a difference by casting the accomplishments

21

of the individual applicant in a particular light, or

22

the potential of an individual applicant in a particular

23

light.

24
25

What -- what universities are looking for
principally with respect to this individualized

consideration is what is this individual going to

contribute to our campus?

on that because it can have a bearing on evaluating what

4

they've accomplished, and it can have a bearing for the

5

reasons I tried to identify earlier to Justice Alito on

6

what they can bring to the table, what they can bring to

7

that freshman seminar, what they can bring to the

8

student government, what they can bring to the campus

9

environment --

10

And race can have a bearing

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, so.

But it is

11

the correct answer to Justice Alito's -- if there are

12

ever two applicants where the GPA, the test -- the

13

grades, the SA1, SA2, leadership, activities, awards,

14

work experience, community service, family's economic

15

status, school's socioeconomic status, family's

16

responsibility, single-parent home, languages other than

17

English spoken at home, and SAT score relative to

18

school's average race, if you had a situation where

19

those -- all those things were absolutely identical,

20

than the person would be admitted on the bounds of race.

How does that impact the military?

8

schools?

JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11
12

Is it your position that he will be

No, Justice Alito.

Then I don't understand the

argument.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

The point of educational

13

diversity, the point of what the University of Texas is

14

trying to achieve is to create an environment in which

15

everyone develops an appropriate sense of citizenship,

16

everyone develops the capacity to lead in a racially

17

diverse society, and so it will benefit every ROTC

18

applicant from the University of Texas.

19

And 43 percent of the Officer Corps comes

20

from the ROTC.

It's a very significant source of our

21

military leadership.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

is your view on how we tell whether -- when the

24

University has attained critical mass?

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

General, how -- what

I don't think critical --

69
Alderson Reporting Company

I agree with my friend that critical mass is not a

2

number.

3

that it is numerical.

I think it would be very ill-advised to suggest

4

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

I'm hearing a

5

lot about what it's not.

6

because our responsibility is to decide whether this use

7

of race is narrowly tailored to achieving, under this

8

University's view, critical mass.

9
10

I'd like to know what it is

GENERAL VERRILLI:

May I answer,

Mr. Chief Justice?

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, yes.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

13

I think -- I don't think that this is a

situation in which the Court simply affords complete

15

deference to the University's judgment that it hasn't

16

17

accomplish its educational mission.

18

I think that the Court ought to -- has to

19

make its own independent judgment.

I think the way the

20

Court would go about making that independent judgment is

21

to look at the kind of information that the university

And then what the Court's got to do is

6

satisfy itself that the University has substantiated its

7

conclusion based on that -- based on the information

8

it's considered, that it needs to consider race to

9

further advance the educational goals that Grutter has

10

identified as a compelling interest.

11

And I will say, I do think, as the number of

12

minority enrollees gets higher, the burden on the

13

university to do that is going to get harder to meet.

14

But I don't think -- I don't think there is a number,

15

and I don't think it would be prudent for this Court to

16

suggest that there is a number, because it would raise

17

exactly the kind of problem that I -- that I think

18

Justice Kennedy identified in the Grutter dissent of

19

creating hydraulic pressure towards that number.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

We should probably stop

21

calling it critical mass then, because mass, you know,

22

assumes numbers, either in size or a certain weight.

cultures, uniting in a commitment to freedom, and to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your complaint

20

limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100?

21

As written, is that what it's limited to?

22

MR. REIN:

No, because it said, "any and all

23

other damages," at the point when we were writing it,

24

which was --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because of -In Arizonans and Alvarez

we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact.

10

Did you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100,

11

specifically?

12

MR. REIN:

The only specific number in the

13

complaint, because of the point in time when it was

14

filed was the application fee, which we believe --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And you would have paid

16

that no matter what; under any system of admission you

17

would have paid the same $100.

18

MR. REIN:

You would have paid the fee in

19

return for a fair processing of the application, which

20

she did not receive, and we think that is a claim that

21

will be sustained.

22

It is not tested at this point.

And the second thing is, because of the way

23

the case was bifurcated, with the agreement of all and

24

the district court as well, we did not develop the

25

additional damages here.

MR. REIN:

Because as -- as in the BIO, what

8

UT pointed out was there are other kinds of financial

injuries which were not ascertainable at the time the

10

complaint was filed because we were trying to put her

11

into the university.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

She was going to get a

better job because she went to a different university?

MR. REIN:

That's one of the things they

suggested.

There are differences in cost between the --

what she paid at LSU and what she would have paid at UT.

Let me go to another issue that, you know, I

20
21

think I never completed my answer to Justice Breyer.

22

Where we stand on what you should do about Grutter is as

23

follows.

24
25

We recognize, as in the words of -- that the
Solicitor General just issued -- that there is an
75
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interest which is cognizable in diversity.

2

that was the root question in Grutter, could you

3

recognize it at all.

4

as you are seeing here, is universities like UT and many

5

others have read it to be green light, use race, no end

6

point, no discernible target, no critical mass written,

7

you know, in circumstances reduced to something that can

8

be reviewed.

9

That is --

But what we are concerned about,

And as long as you don't cross two lines,

10

determinative points and fixed quotas -- "quotas"

11

meaning we will fill this quota exclusively with who we

12

deem to be under-represented -- you are okay.

13

think that's the way Grutter was intended.

14

intended to say this is an area of great caution; using

15

race itself raises all kinds of red flags, so before you

16

use race make a determination whether really, your

17

interest in critical mass -- that is, in the dialogue

18

and interchange, the educational interest, is that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We don't

Grutter was

You are not suggesting

that if every minority student that got into a

21

university got into only the physical education program;

22

and in this particular university that -- that physical

23

education program includes all the star athletes; so

24

every star athlete in the school happens to be black or

25

Hispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now

Well, I think you are talking

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the holistic way that

Grutter permits?

7

MR. REIN:

Well, if you are saying there's a

8

-- a differentiated department of physical education,

9

which is like a separate college, you have changed the

10

nature of the hypothetical.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, it's just that every

12

one of their students who happens to be a minority is

13

going to end up in that program.

14

university could consider that it needs a different

15

diversity in its other departments?

20

that's one of the base problems with the classroom

21

diversity concept.

22

if 40 percent of our students are minorities, are they

23

not in the small classrooms?

24

Statistically you would say that's an aberration.

25

might ask the question what's causing it?

3

same thing when they say, when we are looking at the

4

holistic measure, we are looking for that student who

5

is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear

6

scientist?

7

MR. REIN:

No.

Because they don't take into

8

account your interests, they don't ask you, are you

9

going to join ROTC, they don't ask you are you going to

10

major -- major in physics.

11

the UT system to allocate access to different majors,

12

they do that in a way that is basically premised on

13

academic index.

14

And when it comes time in

So they have a two-tiered admission system.

15

They are only here focused -- their preference goes to

16

admission as such, it doesn't go to sorting people out

17

by majors.

18

And if I might then say to Justice Breyer, I

19

think our answer is, when we see what UT is doing, what

20

we that -- Grutter's -- you know, it has been perceived

21

as a green light; go ahead and use race, race which is

22

otherwise really a highly questionable, an abominable

23

kind of sorting out.

I thought your hypothetical, Justice Alito,

13

at the beginning we don't have critical mass because we

14

don't know what it is and we refuse to say what it is,

15

there is no judicial supervision, there is no strict

16

scrutiny and there is no end point to what they are

17

doing.

18

Where is the end point?

If you have nothing to

So what we have said, and it comes right

19

back to Justice Breyer, how would you write it, you can

20

clarify it, you can say Grutter properly applies,

21

requires you to do A, B, C, and -- and we've said in our

22

brief that would be satisfactory.

23

that you then have it surviving side by side, there

24

could be enormous confusion.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But to the extent

So what you want me to do

80
Alderson Reporting Company

1

is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what

2

the underlying determinations of critical mass were

3

there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas --

4

which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will

5

then find enough of a difference that I can write some

6

words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a

7

thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with

8

programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that

9

right?
MR. REIN:

10

Well, I'm saying if you clarify

11

the needs and the necessity point, if you then look at

12

some of the other deficiencies and clarify the -- the

13

consideration of reasonably available alternatives as a

14

necessity, if you then attribute that -- you attribute

15

the weaknesses of the Texas program to the absence of

16

those factors, I think you can fashion a result in this

17

case which may or may not have to, quote, "overrule"

18

Grutter.

19

It's really a matter, what do you -- do you

20

want to clearly restate what it is that allows the use

21

of this odious classification?

22

talking about, it's a narrow window; and it should be

23

stated as a narrow window.

universities that once you reach a certain number, then

conclusion is to assume that Grutter is an unlimited

mandate without end point to just use race to your own

satisfaction and to be deferred to in your use of race.
