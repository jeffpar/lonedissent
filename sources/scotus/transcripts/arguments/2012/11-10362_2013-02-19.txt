ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA,

8

FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
MR. PAOLELLA:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The plain language of Section 2680(h)'s is law

11
12

enforcement proviso waives sovereign immunity in

13

clear, precise and unambiguous terms.

14

waiver to any claim for one of the six enumerated torts

15

committed by a Federal investigative or law enforcement

16

officer acting within the scope of his or her

17

employment.

It extends the

And it defines investigative or law

18
19

enforcement officer as any officer of the United States

20

who is quote, "empowered by law," unquote, to carry out

21

searches, seizures or arrests.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

Would that include, say,

23

a meat -- a meat inspector?

There is a wide range of

24

Federal employees that have arrest or search or

25

seizure -Â­

The proviso doesn't say any

officer of the United States."

5

term "officer" carries some water here.

6

spectrum of individuals who have powers -- for example,

7

to carry out searches -- we can envision on the one hand

8

very traditional core law enforcement officers.

9

It used the term "any

Let's take a DEA officer who can carry out

10

11

12

something like a meat inspector or an OSHA inspector,

13

who may have a limited ability to carry out searches,

14

but these are searches that are in really a law

15

enforcement capacity -- an administrative capacity as

16

opposed to a core law enforcement capacity.

At the other end of the spectrum, we have

17

So the government raises the argument, and

18

we think it's a plausible interpretation, that by using

19

the term "officer" rather than any employee of the

20

United States, that there was some limiting factor

21

imported into the statute, thereby the statute's plain

22

language.

23

And I would trust my colleague from the

24

Solicitor General's office to map the boundaries of

25

that.

I would say that in any case, a correctional
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

officer, who are the individuals who are involved here

2

in committing the complained-of acts, certainly falls

3

much closer to core law enforcement on that spectrum

4

than to the administrative side.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As a general matter, first

6

in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a

7

correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to

8

be a peace officer? Do you know?

9

MR. PAOLELLA:

The -- yes.

In many states

10

that use the term "peace officer" in the statutes

11

defining a peace officer for things -- for example,

12

authorizing the use of force or authorizing the carriage

13

of weapons -- many States -- it's not uniform, but many

14

States include correctional officers within that ambit.

15

The Federal Government typically does not

16

use the term "peace officer" in its statutes, but if you

17

look at Federal statutes that use the term "law

18

enforcement officer," which is the very term that's used

19

in subsection (h), many -- many of those other statutory

20

schemes expressly include correctional officers.

21

for example, for purposes of civil service pay, for

22

purposes of death benefits, of retirement benefits.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So,

That doesn't prove that

24

they're officers.

I mean, that's -- that's not the test

25

for an officer, how much you're paid.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

The test is

Official

1

whether you exercise significant authority under the

2

laws of the United States.

3

but I'm not sure that a prison guard exercises

4

significant authority under the laws of the United

5

States.

6

MR. PAOLELLA:

That's a pretty fuzzy line,

I would think in the context

7

of the prison, it's hard to imagine how a prison guard

8

could exercise any more authority than they do.

9

addition to their correctional function, prison

In

10

correctional officers are essentially the police force

11

for the prison.

12

They are charged with maintaining order, and

13

they're charged with enforcing the laws of the United

14

States within the confines of the prison, and indeed in

15

some specified cases, outside the prison walls.

16

example, they are explicitly authorized under Section

17

3050 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code not just to carry out

18

arrests in prison for violations of the Federal law, both by

19

prisoners and visitors, but to carry out arrests outside

20

the prison walls to prevent prisoner escapes or to

21

prevent assaults on other law enforcement officers.

22

there's quite expressly an arrest authority granted to

23

correctional officers.

24

to search for contraband, both in the context of

25

visitors to prison and prisoners themselves.

For

14

an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she

15

is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional

assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that.

17

Assuming it falls within the definition of a law

18

enforcement activity.

19

Because I am finding it hard

MR. PAOLELLA:

Justice Sotomayor, let me

20

begin answering that question by making a distinction

21

which I think is an important distinction here, between

22

the definition of status and the definition of the

23

conduct that's implied here.

24

crucial difference between the amicus's argument on one

25

hand and the Solicitor General's office on the other

The amicus would limit the type of conduct

that's covered by the statute.

actions that occur in a law enforcement capacity.

I'm not sure exactly what that means.

topic --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

broadly.

16

agent would engage in, including protective services,

security services, like your officers.

1

limiting it to criminal activity, limited to law

2

enforcement activities broadly defined.

3

MR. PAOLELLA:

The problem with amicus's

4

requirement is it has no textual basis in the

5

statute.

6

The statute is very precise.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I will give you --

7

I'll give you a textual basis.

Why is it if all the

8

statute is concerned about is the status of being a law

9

enforcement -- investigative or law enforcement

10

officer -- why is it that the exception it makes does

11

not eliminate the exemption for libel, slander,

12

misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract

13

rights?

14

There is excepted from the provisions of the

15

Tort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault,

16

battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious

17

prosecution, abusive process, libel, slander,

18

misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract

19

rights.

20

However, for -- for purposes of this

21

exemption from the exemption -- the exception from the

22

exemption, they leave out the latter part.

23

24

put in the others is that those are the kind of torts

MR. PAOLELLA:

would not occur.

6

MR. PAOLELLA:

I think that that is a

7

limiting factor that is not just implicit but explicit

8

in the statutory text.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it's -- it's a

10

limiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an

11

intent to limit the -- the activities of investigative

12

or law enforcement officers to those activities

13

conducted in the course of investigating or enforcing

14

the law.
MR. PAOLELLA:

15

Well, the fact that Congress

16

was so explicit about categorizing precisely the kind of

17

torts that are covered here -- that sort of conduct --

18

and the fact that Congress was so precise about

19

cross-referencing Section 1346(b), which incorporates

20

the scope of employment requirement, suggests to me that

21

when Congress wanted to confine the capacity in which

22

the acts occurred, it could do so, and it did in fact do

23

so.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand -Why would it leave out

that Congress made, that it would not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

it's the judgment.

9

judgment?

10

That's what I'm asking you.

I -- I didn't deny that

What reason could there be for that

MR. PAOLELLA:

That it didn't think that

11

those sorts of torts in this context -- and I think we

12

all agree this is a law enforcement-oriented provision.

13

It's called the law enforcement proviso.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. PAOLELLA:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I give you a reason.
Yes.
The reason -- the reason

17

they left it out is that they don't think those torts

18

would be committed in the course of investigating or

19

enforcing the law.

20

MR. PAOLELLA:

I think that's right,

21

Your Honor, but that doesn't mean that from that we

22

ought to draw an entirely extra-textual additional

23

limitation that goes beyond the specific line that

24

Congress did, in fact, draw here.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your view is that the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limitation is scope of employment.

2

MR. PAOLELLA:

That's right.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The scope of employment

4

is, and you don't add on anything else to that.

5

don't add arrest, search and seizure.

6

You

But does this whole issue have an academic

7

flavor, because how in the world could the conduct

8

involved in this case qualify as within the scope of

9

employment?

10

MR. PAOLELLA:

First of all, Your Honor, I

11

think that the question of scope of employment was

12

something that was conceded below.

13

litigated.

14

brief.

15

this Court formulated it, it was excluded from the

16

question presented.

17

to address it.

18

if it's important.

19

It was never

It was never briefed before the Respondents'

And from my reading of the question presented as

So I don't think this Court needs

It's more properly addressed on remand

But here I think that there is an argument

20

that's within the scope of employment.

21

at cases, for example the Mary M. case out of the

22

California Supreme Court, there the California Supreme

23

Court held that a sexual assault by a law enforcement

24

officer of an individual who was subject to that

25

officer's authority could be held to be within the scope
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And if you look

Official

1

of employment, because an officer is vested with

2

authority and it is reasonably foreseeable that that

3

authority can sometimes be abused if it happens when the

4

officer is in uniform, on job hours, dealing with

5

someone who that individual is authorized to use

6

appropriate force against.

7

And even in Pennsylvania, you see cases

8

where people do outrageous things, like a private

9

detective shooting a picketing protester, where the

10

Pennsylvania courts have held that that's within the

11

scope of employment.

12

It's a complicated issue.

It's an issue of

13

State law and it will be different in every State, which

14

is why I would suggest it's more appropriate for this to

15

be handled on remand rather than have a ruling by this

16

Court on a narrow issue of Pennsylvania State law.

17

I think it is hardly implausible that Pennsylvania

18

courts would find this within the scope of employment.

19
20

Your Honor, if there's no further questions,
I will reserve the remainder of my time.

Thank you, counsel.

FOR RESPONDENT, SUPPORTING REVERSAL AND REMAND
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

2

please the Court:
The text and structure of the law

3

enforcement proviso in the Federal Tort Claims Act more

4

generally make clear that the proviso unambiguously

5

waives sovereign immunity for claims arising under the

6

six intentional torts listed for acts or omissions of

7

persons qualifying as Federal law enforcement officers

8

while acting within their scope of employment.

9

Nothing in the statute supports amicus's

10

additional limit, which would require such officers to

11

be acting in a law enforcement capacity or by exercising

12

law enforcement authority, neither of which phrase

13

occurs within the statute itself.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Quite the contrary --

What are the kinds of

15

things, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of

16

employment, but would not be acting in a law

17

enforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer?

18

What's the difference between those two standards for a

19

law enforcement officer?

20

MR. YANG:

Well, this is complicated by the

21

fact that for the Federal Tort Claims Act, scope of

22

employment is a question that turns on State law.

23

result it will vary.

24

understanding of scope of employment and sometimes in

25

fact will encompass within the scope of employment

As a

Some States have a rather broad

rather egregious intentional torts.

2

necessarily what the Court might think of as within the

3

scope of one's Federal law enforcement authority.

4

It's not

So with respect to law enforcement

5

authority, I mean, this -- that makes the question a

6

little more difficult because that is not something that

7

actually appears in the statute and it's not something

8

that the United States embraces as a test because it is

9

a creation of the amicus.

10

What the statute here does, the only term --

11

the only place that it uses law enforcement is in the

12

defined term "investigative or law enforcement officer"

13

and then what it does in defining that term --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you can't give me just a

15

couple of examples of how the difference would matter,

16

you know, in some States, where something would be --

17

would meet the scope of employment test, but not meet

18

the acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law

19

enforcement officer again.

20

MR. YANG:

Again, acting as a law

21

enforcement officer test is not something that appears

22

in the statute and it's not something that even amicus

23

has tried to meet the limitations of.

24

various things.

25

as limited as executing a search, seizing evidence or

rationale.

3

That would be the Pooler type of

It could be something incident to that,

4

writing a report, as amicus suggests.

It could be other

5

things.

6

very things that we're talking about.

They go on

7

patrol, they talk to kids in schools.

There are all

8

types of things that law enforcement officers might do

9

that don't fall within what might thing -- what one

Law enforcement officers often aren't doing the

10

might think of as what, you know, you see on television

11

when officers are making contact with the public in

12

rather high stakes incidents.

13

So it's difficult both because we have a

14

State law term that varies and a term that doesn't even

15

appear in the statute and that we don't embrace.

16

again, it's difficult to provide examples in any

17

definitive way because both of the comparators shift

18

depending on what we're talking about.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

Mr. Yang, even if --

20

if -- it depends on State law, that's clear.

21

the United States sometimes concede scope of authority

22

so it can represent -- it can be the sole defendant in

23

the case, the individual officer is off the hook, so

24

that the United States could make the argument:

25

never happened; the officer didn't do what the plaintiff
16

But does

I believe, if I understand your

question correctly, the answer is yes, but let me

4

qualify that.

Osborne v. Haley.

6

employment for purposes of the Westfall Act turns on

7

whether at the time of the alleged incident the officer,

8

or employee in many cases, was acting within the scope

9

of his or her employment.

10

This came up in a case called
And the question about scope of

Now, when the United States investigates,

11

this is authority that is delegated to the Attorney

12

General, which is in turn redelegated to the U.S.

13

Attorney's offices, investigates the relevant

14

circumstances and determines that the allegations are

15

just false, not correct at all, in fact it never

16

happened, the employee was sitting at his or her desk

17

beavering away at important Federal matters, in that

18

instance, the Government will say that the employee was

19

in fact acting within the scope of his or her employment

20

and can explain that the reason for that is the

21

Government rejects the underlying factual assertion.

22

That's something that then is litigated if

23

the Plaintiff seeks to challenge the scope

24

determination.

25

explains that this is how the situation will play out,

And the Court's decision in Osborne

17
Alderson Reporting Company

is that then the merits of the case ultimately condensed

2

into a challenge to the scope certification of the

4

So, no, we don't simply say they were within

scope for no reason.

6

within scope by evaluating the circumstances at issue

8

employee was acting within the scope properly, we will

certify that the employee was acting within the scope.

15

MR. YANG:

Because they

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it couldn't be that

obvious, I guess?
MR. YANG:

Well, I think in those cases the

8

Government took a position that never was a position

9

that made it to the Solicitor General's office.

And

10

when we took this -- both in the Reynolds case when

11

there was an adverse decision to the United States and

12

in this case, we determined that the position was not

13

one that could be -- was not correct under the text.

14

And I think, as amicus's -- amicus does, I

15

think, a valiant job of trying to defend that position,

16

but at the end of the day, there simply is not a textual

17

argument to get to that outcome.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think it is true that

19

there is a strong textual argument for your position.

20

But let me ask this:

21

statistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter

22

how many prison suits against the government this ruling

23

that you propose would -- would cause?

24

we have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and

25

this prison work, there is a lot of shoving, guards have

to break up fights.

2

So there is going to be any number of

3

instances where the question is did the guard overreach.

4

And if I make the assumption, and it's just an

5

assumption because I haven't looked at any statistics,

6

but there is -- this is going to vastly expand the

7

number of cases in which the Government is the

8

defendant.

9

congressional intent to adopt your position?

10

Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the

MR. YANG:

I guess there is a few parts to

11

that question.

12

statistics that we would be able to reliably extrapolate

13

to see what this would mean.

14

some additional cases.

15

as we explain in our reply brief, including the Prison

16

Litigation Reform Act, which requires the prisoners both

17

pay their filing fees and if they obtain three strikes,

18

must in fact -- they lose IFP status and must pay that

19

filing fee in advance, and it's a substantial amount of

20

money for many prisoners, given what they earn.

21

On the statistics, I am not aware of any

I think there may well be

However, there are other tools,

So we think that it's not a reason to ignore

what we think is the plain text, particularly where

Congress here has in the proviso specifically referenced

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you suggest why

3

Congress might have left out libel, slander,

4

misrepresentation?

5

MR. YANG:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think -Why -- why would they leave

7

that out if they are only looking at the office and not

8

at the function that the person is performing?

9

MR. YANG:

Well, I think that those torts

10

serve as a rough approximation of what Congress

11

anticipated would be the areas where it thought the

12

United States should be liable, when we are talking

13

about Federal law enforcement officers.

14

fact --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

And I think in

16

point.

So what you are saying is that it suggests that

17

18

law enforcement.

MR. YANG:

Well, not -- I don't know that

20

that is the case, Justice Scalia.

22

for instance, understand "officer of the United States,"

25

ideas.

Certainly there is

All evoke Federal criminal law enforcement

However, when we look at the text that Congress
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

used to implement the statute, the text is not like any

2

of the other instances within the Federal Tort Claims

3

Act, where Congress has limited the waiver to particular

4

types of activities or carved out certain activities.

5

In fact, what Congress did was reference

6

back to the general waiver provision which explains that

7

the waiver applies to acts within the scope of

8

employment.

9

If Congress had wanted, for instance, to say

10

only within law enforcement capacity, it would have used

11

very different language.

12

the other provisions in Sections 2680, for instance,

13

subsections (a), (b), and (c), which limit -- which

14

carve out the execution of a statute or regulation,

15

exercise of discretionary functions, the loss,

16

miscarriage or negligent transmission of postal matter,

17

assessment or collection of taxes or customs duties, (f)

18

specifically directs -- carves out the imposition or

19

establishment of a quarantine, (j) carves out the

20

combatant activities of military forces.

21

wanted to use similar language like law enforcement

22

activities of a law enforcement officer, it would have

23

done that.

25

The language of sections --

both ways.

There could be many answers to

that question.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. YANG:

Okay.

You could, as the amicus or as

21

the Petitioner suggests, say that the enforcement of a

22

criminal sentence is part of law enforcement capacity,

23

so anything that they do is law enforcement.

24

You could think of law enforcement capacity

25

as more like arrests, you know, searches for violations

of Federal criminal law, and that sort of thing.

might be exercises that the Court would have to engage

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. BUCHOLTZ,
FOR AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW,

10

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

11
12

Those

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

13

I hope to convince the Court of two things

14

today.

First is about our reading of the law

15

enforcement proviso as limited to conduct of

16

investigative or law enforcement officers acting as

17

such.

18

plausible.

19

enacted in light of the structure of the statute and in

20

light of ordinary English usage.

The first is that that reading is textually

21

It is a reasonable reading of what Congress

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask, in light of

22

your opening statement, are you then abandoning your

23

position that it must be either arrest, search or

24

seizure?

25

You have used the Ninth Circuit formula.
MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not really clear how different the Ninth Circuit and the

2

Third Circuit are from each other, because there haven't

3

been cases that have arisen that have really tested the

4

proposition that the Third Circuit meant only, literally

5

only, the execution of a search, the seizure of

6

evidence, or the making of an arrest, and that would

7

exclude conduct very closely incident to one of those

8

things.

9

Those cases just haven't arisen.
So the courts have used different

10

formulations.

11

things by them, but I wouldn't want to exaggerate the

12

differences between the Third Circuit and the Ninth

13

Circuit.

14

getting at here, which was the law enforcement proviso

15

was about law enforcement activity.

16

covering the United States under the FTCA for abuses of

17

law enforcement authority like had occurred in

18

Collinsville, which was the national scandal that

19

prompted the enactment of the proviso.

20

They appear to mean slightly different

Both are trying to capture what Congress was

It was about

So I think the answer to, Justice Ginsburg,

21

to your question, is:

We think that if you take the

22

Third Circuit's language in Pooler, which of course is

23

not this case, but if you take the Pooler language

24

literally and you say that the only conduct covered is

25

conduct in the course of -- that's language the Court
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

used a few times in Pooler -- in the course of a search,

2

an arrest, or a seizure of evidence, that's problematic

3

because it's clear that Congress was trying to cover

4

abuses of law enforcement authority, including malicious

5

prosecution and abuse of process, which we know because

6

Congress included those torts in the exception to the

7

exception.

8

conducted a search and then wrote a false report about

9

the search that he had conducted, the writing of the

And if you had a situation where an officer

10

report wouldn't literally be in the course of the

11

search.

12

that would be excluded.

13

And so if you take those words in Pooler literally,
That can't be right.

So to that extent we agree with the Ninth

14

Circuit position rather than the Third Circuit position.

15

But again I'm not really sure that it's fair to

16

attribute that extreme position to the Third Circuit.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bucholtz, the statute

18

itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it.

19

says law enforcement officers acting within the scope of

20

their employment.

21

It

So I guess my question is, given that there

22

is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one

23

would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting

24

as law enforcement officers?

25

the conduct-based limitation that's already there?

Why wouldn't one use just

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Justice Kagan, I don't think

2

it's a substitution.

3

anything.

4

English usage, when there's a reference to somebody

5

defined by their status, it's fair to assume that the

6

reference to the person defined by their status is

7

really just intended to cover things they do in that

8

relevant status and not things they do in some other

9

capacity.

10

I think it's an addition if it's

But really the reason is that under ordinary

What we're asking the Court to do here is

11

exactly what the Court did in Lane v. Pena.

12

Pena, the statute at issue was the Rehabilitation Act.

13

It waived sovereign immunity and provided a damages

14

remedy against Federal providers of funding.

15

Department of Transportation clearly was a Federal

16

provider of funding.

17

to all sorts of recipients.

18

In Lane v.

The

It gave out all sorts of funding

But that's not what the case was about.

The

19

case was about the Merchant Marine Academy and somebody

20

who was dismissed from it.

21

the reference to Federal funding providers like the

22

Department of Transportation had to be read as limited

23

to Federal funding providers acting as such.

24

the Court's words, "acting as such."

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what the Court said is

Okay.

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Those were

And then -- then

Official

1

take that theory and track through the statute to show

2

me how that theory works, which is what your opening

3

argument was going to do.

4

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Justice Kennedy, in the first

5

sentence of the proviso, the operative provision,

6

Congress referred to acts or omissions of investigative

7

or law enforcement officers of the United States.

8

Congress didn't say any acts or omissions of

9

investigative or law enforcement officers were covered.

10

It didn't say all were covered.

11

omissions of law enforcement officers in the same way

12

that the statute at issue in Lane referred to conduct of

13

a Federal funding provider.

14

It just said acts or

And so what this Court should do, we submit,

15

is construe acts or omissions of investigative or law

16

enforcement officers of the United States as limited to

17

acts or omissions of those defined -- that defined class

18

of persons in the relevant capacity, when they're acting

19

as law enforcement officers.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But again, it's not just any

21

acts of law enforcement officers.

It's acts of law

authority.

have, which is the same question that I gave to Mr.

And now you're saying acting as a law
I mean, one question I suppose I

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Yang, is what's the difference between those two things?

2

And I guess the second question is:

3

substitute one phrase about how they have to be acting

4

for the phrase that Congress actually used?

5

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Why would we

Congress didn't, in the

6

proviso, Justice Kagan, Congress did not actually use

7

the phrase "scope of employment."

8

incorporate scope of employment as a limitation

9

explicitly in the proviso.

It did not actually

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it a limitation?

scope a limitation?

20

I thought that you -- you didn't

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Justice Ginsburg, we

21

certainly agree that -- that the conduct that's covered

22

has to be within the scope of the Federal officer's

23

employment.

24

moment ago in response to Justice Kagan is that

25

requirement exists in 1346, not in the proviso by its

The only point I was trying to make a

terms.

2

argued in our brief, we think that one way the Court

3

could affirm the judgment below is to hold that the

4

officers here were not acting within the scope of their

5

employment, taking the allegations as true, as they have

6

to be at this stage of the case.

7

We certainly agree with that, and as we've

But to return to Justice Kagan, to your

8

question about why Congress would have wanted to -- the

9

Court to -- to interpret "acts or omissions of law

10

enforcement officers" as acting as such, it's because --

11

in part the answer is because scope turns on State law.

12

So Congress doesn't know when it enacts the proviso

13

what's going to be covered if the only limitation is

14

scope, because that turns on 50 different States' laws.

15

And -- and I think that it's fair to say that there are

16

actual meaningful differences between different States'

17

laws as to scope as we -- as we point out in our brief.

18

But the other past of the answer is the --

19

is the second part of this Court's analysis in Lane v.

20

Pena, which is it's entirely possible literally to read

21

the Rehabilitation Act in Lane, and I would grant that

22

it's possible literally to read the words in the

23

proviso, as covering everything that a defined law

24

enforcement officer does within the scope of employment.

25

But the Court said in Lane:

We can't read the statute

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that way, because we're talking about a waiver of

2

immunity, and waivers of immunity, even if you don't

3

have to put a heavy thumb on the scales and even if you

4

don't have to require that it be unequivocal -- we're

5

not going that far here -- you can't interpret it more

6

broadly than there's any reason to think Congress meant.

generally aren't engaged in law enforcement activity

You're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged

5

in the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's

6

engaged in the tour.

7

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

That's right, because he

8

meets the status-based definition that Congress

9

provided, but there's no reason to think Congress

10

intended that he be covered when he's not engaged in law

11

enforcement activity.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

What -- what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you don't think the

5

EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces

6

statutes and regulations, do you?

7
8

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

It depends, Justice Scalia,

it depends --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would an officer of the EPA

10

be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to

11

a company saying, you know, you are violating section

12

such-and-such of the statute?

13

officer?

14

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Is that a law enforcement

Well, the person who writes

15

the letter may qualify as a law enforcement officer

16

under the definition, but that's a different question, I

17

would submit, than whether that -- whether that act

18

constitutes law enforcement activity.

19

I think the answer to that question,

20

Justice Scalia, is probably no, but the important

21

follow-up is if that person meets the definition of law

22

enforcement officer because he's an EPA agent, and after

23

the letter he follows up and goes to the premises of the

24

recipient of the letter, knocks down the door and

25

conducts an illegal search, that's what Congress was
38
Alderson Reporting Company

trying to cover.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but EPA is not what

3

I'm thinking of, I don't think they are.

4

of policemen.

5

to patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and

6

not seizing evidence.

7

basically what they do.

8

enforcement activity?

9
10

Okay.

I am thinking

Now, one basic job of a policeman is

They are on patrol.
All right?

MR. BUCHOLTZ:
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's

Is that a law

If it's an FBI agent?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I

11

mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand.

12

sure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to

13

ordinary policemen.

14

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

So I'm

Justice Breyer, the answer --

15

the answer -- well, it might not be so easy to find an

16

analogy to an ordinary policeman --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But FBI agents,

18

who are the federal police, they're people on Federal

19

enclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal

20

enclaves, they act like policemen, okay.

21

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Sure.

And when they are

22

engaged in patrols, I think it's fair to say that's

23

probably law enforcement activity --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

That's favorable.

mean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a

39
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble

2

when we consider real policemen.

3

one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it.

4

If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots

5

of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't

6

doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside

7

your narrow definition.

8

examples, but I came up with the ones I did.

So if you have a broad

inspector.

13

this is an important difference between our position and

14

the Government's -- the Government would say that

15

because OSHA isn't a criminal law in the traditional

16

sense and an OSHA inspector or an OSHA agent isn't

17

enforcing criminal law in the colloquial sense, that

18

that shouldn't be covered.

19

So there was talk earlier about an OSHA
The Government's position -- and I think

But if the OSHA inspector knocks down your

20

door and conducts an illegal search and batters you, why

21

shouldn't that be covered?

22

enforcement abuse, and we know that law enforcement

23

abuses is exactly what Congress is trying to get at.

24

Government, it's like it's trying to relitigate Marshall

25

against Barlows where this Court held that OSHA

We know that's a law

40
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

inspectors have to have a warrant even though you could

2

think of OSHA as being administrative or civil as

3

opposed to criminal.

4

Government made there a generation ago and they lost.

5
6
7

That's the argument that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So how does that argument

help your case?
MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Because, Justice Kennedy, the

8

point in this case is that we agree that correctional

9

officers fall within the plain language of the

10

definition that Congress provided.

11

of the proviso is there are two sentences, an operative

12

provision and the definition.

13

Again, the structure

We are trying to get the Court to construe

14

the operative provision, the first sentence, in the same

15

way the Court did in Lane against Pena.

16

is trying to get the Court to construe the definition,

17

the second sentence.

18

definition, what the term means, the Court has much less

19

scope to construe that in some way other than the

20

literal language that Congress provided where Congress

21

said what the term means.

The Government

What Congress said in the

22

So we agree under the plain language of the

23

definition that correctional officers are investigative

24

or law enforcement officers because of 18 U.S.C. 3050,

25

which gives them the power under limited, and
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inapplicable here, circumstances to arrest.

2

We think that if you look at correctional

3

officers under 18 U.S.C. 3050 or under the different

4

authorities under 18 U.S.C. 4001 and following and the

5

regulations, that they wear two hats.

6

act in a law enforcement capacity, but not usually,

7

because that only applies in the narrow context of

8

escapes or visitors.

9

incarcerated prisoners, like in the allegations here,

Sometimes they

When they are dealing with already

10

they are really not acting in that capacity at all.

11

They are wearing a different hat.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You are saying that the

13

Government is trying to minimize the consequences of

14

coming out its way by providing a definition of the

15

officers covered, which will not hold.

16

does cover a broader category of officers including OSHA

17

inspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not

18

engaged in law enforcement activities.

19

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

You think it

Justice Scalia, you have

20

absolutely perfectly encapsulated our position.

21

you.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Thank

The reason why we think that

24

that difference between our position and the

25

Government's is important is that the Government's
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position would render the proviso severely

2

underinclusive.

3

law enforcement abuses and provide a remedy.

4

Congress -- the Government would say that if it's not a

5

traditional law enforcement officer in the colloquial

6

sense of like a constable, that it's not covered.

7

all sorts of agents of the United States from OSHA to

8

FDA to all sorts of other agencies, to EPA, engage in

9

law enforcement activity like the three things we know

We know Congress was trying to get at
And

But

10

Congress was focused like a laser beam on:

11

searches, seizing evidence, making arrests for

12

violations of Federal law.

13

consistent with the text or our understanding of what

14

Congress intended, to the extent it's different from the

15

text, to say that that's not covered.

And I don't see any basis

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Executing

The one other advantage of

17

your definition is that it takes us out of workplace

18

fights between two employees, because presumably the

19

officers who punch each other out, if that incident

20

occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity.

21

am assuming that is part of your argument as well.
MR. BUCHOLTZ:

22
23
24
25

I

That's part of it, that's

right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Then it goes

back to the question I asked one of your adversaries,

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly

2

we define law enforcement activities.

3

If we take it as broadly as the Government

4

is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very

5

well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement

6

activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be.

7

It would include securing or detaining people, or

8

securing or detaining people.

9

Park Service person who stops a visitor and punches them

And it would include the

10

out.

11

someone and does an intentional tort against them, even

12

though they may just be walking on the grounds rather

13

than serving as security that particular day.

14

It would include the military personnel who stops

So the point is, why should we give it the

15

narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader

16

reading the Government seems to be suggesting?

17

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Well, two parts to the

18

answer, Justice Sotomayor.

19

is trying to give the first sentence the broader

20

reading, which it recognizes then creates a problem that

21

it tries to solve by narrowing the second sentence in a

22

way that we think won't hold.

23

The first is the Government

But the other part of the answer,

24

Justice Sotomayor, is it's about congressional intent.

25

Justice Kennedy asked earlier about whether the
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Government's interpretation or the Petitioner's

2

interpretation would unleash a flood of suits by

3

prisoners and whether it's fair to think that Congress

4

would have intended that.

5

legislative history of the proviso, there is absolutely

6

no indication that anyone in Congress contemplated that

7

the proviso would or could or should apply in the prison

8

situation.

9

remedy for the kinds of raids that had occurred in

10
11

If you look at the

All Congress was focused on was providing a

Collinsville.
And so I think when somebody has two hats,

12

like a prison guard has, because, again, there is two

13

different sources of legal authority that they are

14

exercising, 18 U.S.C. 3050 versus 4001, or a military

15

policeman who has two hats, in the cases like Holian that

16

we describe in our briefs where the Government made the

17

argument that where a military policeman is engaged in a

18

military function, not a law enforcement function, that

19

they are not covered.

20

We think where somebody who meets the

21

definition that Congress provided of an investigative or

22

law enforcement officer has two distinct hats, two

23

distinct capacities.

24

law enforcement one, they are not covered.

25

reason to think that Congress intended that military

When they are not acting in the

45
Alderson Reporting Company

There is no

Official

1

police or prison guards be covered when they are

2

maintaining order on a military base or within a prison.

3

That's not what Congress was trying to get at.

4

And we think again a severe disadvantage of

5

the Government's position, they are trying to solve --

6

in a sense they are trying to solve the same problem

7

that we are with our acting as such interpretation, but

8

they are trying to solve it through the wrong part of

9

the statute and in a way that -- in a way ends up with

10

the worst of both worlds.

11

You end up with broader coverage of the kind

12

of conduct that's covered, broader than there is any

13

reason to think Congress intended, conduct that doesn't

14

involve law enforcement activity at all, but a narrower

15

class of people whose conduct is covered.

16

excludes people like OSHA inspectors, FDA agents, EPA

17

agents and in the rare circumstance where the Forest

18

Service employee is acting as a law enforcement officer

19

rather than as a botanist or an entomologist or

20

something like that, we think Congress intended to cover

21

them.

22

Where that

We know from the definition that there were

23

three exercises of law enforcement authority that

24

Congress was focused like a laser beam on:

25

searches, seizing evidence and making arrests.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Executing
Where

Official

1

somebody meets the definition of law enforcement officer

2

and they are doing one of those three things, there is

3

no basis not to say that they are covered.

4

We think it's better to interpret the first

5

sentence of the proviso the same way the Court did in

6

Lane against Pena as limited to acts or omissions of

7

investigative or law enforcement officers acting as

8

such, and keep the definition that Congress provided the

9

way Congress provided it.

10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then scope becomes kind

of a surplusage.

12

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Not surpluses necessarily,

13

Justice Ginsburg, because it varies among States.

14

could be States where scope is narrower or broader, and

15

there could always be situations where State law is such

16

that the easiest way to resolve a case is under scope,

17

and not under the concept of acting as a law enforcement

18

officer.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There

It has to be a law

20

enforcement function.

also be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law

enforcement function, then it fits.

Give -- give me an example of a

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

So what does scope

Well, if an officer is

1

executing a search but he's doing so because of a

2

personal vendetta against the person whose premises he's

3

searching, and he's -- and he's not -- under whatever

4

the State -- State's law that is applicable, if there is

5

a relatively narrow conception of scope so that you have

6

to be trying to serve your employer, which is the

7

traditional rule, and not just sort of on the job in a

8

loose sense, which is what the D.C. rule has come to be,

9

an officer who is engaged in a search or making --

10

making an arrest for a completely inappropriate reason,

11

not trying to serve the employer, not in any way that's

12

authorized by the employer, might not be within the

13

scope, but might be engaged in one of the three law

14

enforcement activities that Congress specified.

15

other --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the

A prisoner -- a prisoner

17

is supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the

18

evening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's

19

somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to

20

the cell block.

21

Is that an arrest?

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

No, Justice Kennedy, it's not

22

an arrest, for, among other reasons, the reason that

23

prison guards don't have any legal authority to make an

24

arrest in that circumstance.

25

The prisoner's already been arrested.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

That's how he got to jail in the first place.

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, he's violating the

prison regulations.

4

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Yes.

And 28 CFR part 552

sets out the authorities that prison guards have to

6

enforce prison regulations to maintain security and

7

order within the prison, like in that circumstance.

8

That's not making an arrest.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The prison guards have the

That's correct,

14

Justice Kennedy.

15

force and I -- you know, you can make an argument that

16

-- that when you pick somebody up like in your

17

hypothetical, that that's like an arrest at common law.

18

There's no reason to think Congress was getting at that,

19

was trying to cover that in the proviso.

20

That -- that may involve the use of

Where somebody has two different distinct

21

capacities as a matter of law, the way Bureau of Prisons

22

guards do, and they're acting in the one and not the

23

other, then I think that's the simple answer, is that --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the difference

between the officer who punches the prisoner to get him
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on the ground and pick him up?

2

officer who files an arrest complaint against the

3

prisoner, and not to the security officer who just

4

merely carries him back to his cell?

5
6

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Would it apply to the

Justice Sotomayor, the

hypothetical is --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or does some physical

8

injury that's substantial.

So the intentional assault

9

gets treated as an exception to this only when the

10

security officer actually files an arrest complaint?

11

would it at all?

12
13

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Or

Are you talking about a

Bureau of Prison guard filing the arrest complaint?

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Yes.

Well, I think -- one thing to

16

point out is the government informs the Court in its

17

reply brief that in a situation where there has been a

18

violation of prison rules that may also be a violation

19

of Federal law that may also be a crime, such that, you

20

know, in ordinary English usage, you could refer to the

21

prison guard as conducting an investigation for

22

violation of a Federal crime.

23

What happens is the BOP guards don't do that

24

themselves.

They call in the FBI.

25

government says in its reply brief.
50
Alderson Reporting Company

That's what the
So I think that

Official

1

itself is an indication of the distinction between

2

prison guards who are law enforcement officers as

3

Congress has defined the term, but who are not

4

traditional law enforcement officers, as the government

5

seeks to define -- redefine the term, and in that

6

capacity are not acting as law enforcement officers.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you

8

have done this already, so I apologize, but could you

9

just state your definition of what it means to be acting

10

as a law enforcement officer?

11

than the three listed get included?

12

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

What activities other

Well, Justice Kagan, it's

13

hard to give a simple comprehensive answer that applies

14

to all different types of law enforcement officers.

15

me start by saying that the three things that have to be

16

included are the three things that Congress specified,

17

and that's one of the problems with the government's

18

definition, is that it reads out cases involves those

19

three activities, involving, in the government's view --

20

kinds of officers.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you don't want to limit it

22

to those -- so what else gets in the mix?

23

define it generally?

24
25

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Let

How would you

So -- in a case that involves

one of those three things but also something else that's

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

incident to or related to those three things, we think

2

it would probably be artificial.

3

all sorts of hypos, but it might well be artificial to

4

separate the writing of the -- of the report about the

5

arrest from the arrest itself.

6

one of these three specified activities we think is

7

probably covered.

talking about a type of law enforcement officer like an

9

FBI agent who is wearing his law enforcement hat all the

So conduct incident to

We also think that maybe when you are

10

time, doesn't have a second distinct capacity as a

11

matter of law, like a military policeman or correctional

12

officer, that maybe a broader definition is appropriate,

13

that maybe the FBI agent who is -JUSTICE KAGAN:

14
15
16

Maybe?

I mean, yes or no or

when or -MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Well, I mean, Justice Kagan,

17

in fairness, this case doesn't present that question,

18

because it doesn't involve any law enforcement activity at all.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if we're going to adopt

20

your definition, we have to have some understanding of

21

where it's taking us.

22

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Of course.

Of course.

And

23

where I think it would be taking the Court is that as

24

always, there could be hard cases that could arise that

25

the lower courts would have to grapple with, but I think

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the important concept is, that where somebody has two

2

hats, a law enforcement capacity and some other

3

capacity, then it's easy to draw that line, in concept.

4

Again, there could be hard cases, but as a concept, it's

5

easy to draw that line.

6

Where somebody doesn't have two hats, they

7

only have one hat, like an FBI agent, and they are on

8

the job and they are engaged in what normal people would

9

think of as law enforcement activity, maybe that's

10

covered.

11

that.

12

I don't really have a -- have a problem with

I think -- I think that's probably

13

consistent with what Congress was getting at.

14

the way to think about it is, Congress defined "law

15

enforcement officer" with reference to the three

16

specified kinds of exercises of law enforcement

17

authority, but when the FBI agent is interviewing a

18

witness or potential suspect but hasn't yet gotten to

19

the point of arresting a person or conducting a search,

20

you can think of that as preliminary to an exercise of

21

one of the three specified authorities, because after

22

all, that's what the FBI agent has the authority to do,

23

it's what his job entails.

24
25

And maybe

And depending on how the initial questioning
goes, that might be the next step.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

And so it's never

Official

1

far from the scene, when an FBI agent is engaged in what

2

you would normally think of as law enforcement activity,

3

that one of the three specified law enforcement

4

activities could be in the offing.

5

That's very different when you're talking

6

about Forest Service employees who technically meet the

7

definition but who usually are not doing anything within

8

a million miles of what normal people would think of as

9

law enforcement activity.

10

So I think it's important to distinguish

11

between different kinds of people who fall within the

12

definition.

13

to figure out what the implications of this

14

interpretation would be.

15

context, the answer is clear, because there are two

16

distinct capacities.

17

context as a practical matter, given the point that

18

Justice Kennedy made about the likelihood of an enormous

19

number of claims that Congress probably didn't intend.

20

And -- I understand the Court wants to try

I think that in the prison

And that's a hugely important

In the military police context, where there

21

are also two distinct capacities, it's probably pretty

22

easy to draw the line.

23

case-by-case whether something that the Plaintiff

24

alleges should be thought of as law enforcement activity

25

or law enforcement officer acting as such.

In other cases, it will be

54
Alderson Reporting Company

We don't

have a problem with the broad interpretation of law
