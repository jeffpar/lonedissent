5

States.

Mr. Feldman?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

As the language and structure of the

12

Gonzalez Act demonstrate, Congress did not completely

13

eliminate the long-recognized tort remedy that's

14

available to essentially everybody else in the country

15

when doctors perform surgery without a patient's

16

consent.

17

By abrogating the intentional tort exception

18

to the FTCA for the class of cases covered by the

19

Gonzalez Act, Congress both preserved a remedy for the

20

victims of that tort, and, by virtue of the Gonzalez

21

Act's exclusive remedy provision, they made certain that

22

the Federal employees themselves would not be sued.

23

As everyone understood at the time of the

24

enactment, that was the meaning of the terms of the

25

Gonzalez Act.

The Act has two clauses, an operative
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clause and an introductory clause.

2

The operative clause says, in simple

3

declarative terms, that the intentional tort exception

4

to the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any

5

cause of action arising out of a wrongful act or

6

omission in the performance of medical functions.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Feldman, but it says,

8

first, "for purposes of this section."

And, as I -- I

9

understand your argument, those words don't count.

In

10

other words, you would be making -- you would interpret

11

the statute the same way if the sentence started with

12

"the provisions of Section 2680(h)."

13

MR. FELDMAN:

No, Your Honor.

That's not

14

right.

We -- we -- that -- that -- the part after the

15

introductory clause says, "The provisions of the

16

intentional tort exception shall not apply to medical

17

malpractice cases."

18

the government to any government employee who is

19

performing those medical functions.

And that would make it apply across

20

By saying, "for purposes of this section,"

21

Congress limited it in accordance with the case -- the

22

agency by agency approach that it had adopted in this

23

area and limited it to just the cases that are covered

24

by the Gonzalez Act; that is, by malpractice that's

25

committed by doctors of the Department of Defense, the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

National Guard, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and so

2

on.

3

And so the -- each clause serves quite an

4

important function.

5

Act -- they had already passed the statutes dealing, for

6

example, with the Public Health Service that's

7

essentially written in the same terms, with the Veterans

8

Administration -- although part of that was then added

9

later -- with the State Department doctors, and so on.

10

Congress had before the Gonzalez

And so they were proceeding on an agency by

11

agency basis, and the way to accomplish that was to

12

first say, we -- we think that the intentional tort

13

exception should not apply to these cases because in

14

medical batteries of the sort that we -- as alleged in

15

this case, are so close to the kinds of medical

16

malpractice cases that are going to be brought against

17

the government anyhow.

18

But then, in each statute, they say, "for

19

purposes of this section," because it's only the

20

agencies, only the personnel covered by those sections,

21

and the torts covered by those sections.

22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Veterans

Administration, it doesn't say that, does it?

24

MR. FELDMAN:

The Veterans --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FELDMAN:

The Veterans Administration,

2

originally -- the original Veterans Administration

3

statute, which was from about 1965, doesn't have this

4

1089(e) intentional tort exception at all in it.

5

But then they added it later, about 10 years

6

after this statute, and then they added a provision that

7

was slightly worded differently, but it achieves exactly

8

the same result.

9

this section," it says, "by the personnel named in

10
11

Instead of saying, "for purposes of

Section A," which accomplishes exactly the same thing.
And, actually, if you look at the history of

12

that statute, the Senate report on that statute, quite

13

clearly, recites that Congress understood that 1089(e),

14

the statute here, has exactly the effect that I said.

15

And they said, we are modeling it on that provision.

16

And then they did tinker with the wording, and there's

17

actually no explanation for the specific change.

18

But it's not uncommon that, in statutes that

19

have been reviewed by different committees and passed 10

20

or 12 years apart, that Congress would have a -- they

21

would use slightly different language to achieve,

22

essentially, the same purpose.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

What would -- what do you

24

do, if anything, about those of us -- I hope more than

25

one -- who actually look at legislative history, and the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

House and Senate Report -- the Senate Report says

2

Subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort

3

Claims Act, which would otherwise exclude any action for

4

assault and battery, then the House says about the same

5

thing.

6

So, when I look at those two things, I think

7

the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the

8

other side says, it was to get rid of assault and

9

battery as an exception and said the government of the

10

United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery.

11

That's what the two reports say.

12

That's why

they passed it.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

I believe, actually,

14

that's our -- that -- that's the way we read it, exactly

15

like that, which is the -- by nullifying the intentional

16

tort exception -- what the intentional tort exception

17

provides is -- actually, what it says, is, "The

18

provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not

19

apply to any case arising out of assault, battery," and

20

so on.

21

And, by eliminating that, the -- the

22

provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are otherwise

23

totally applicable to cases of medical battery, like

24

this, or other kinds of intentional tort.

25

And so, for cases, covered by the Gonzalez
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Act -- that is, cases of medical malpractice committed

2

within the scope of employment by the doctors of the

3

certain specified agencies that Congress has named --

4

for those cases, there is no intentional tort exception,

5

and, therefore, you can bring an action against the

6

government.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't quite

8

understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the "for

9

purposes of this section."

10

What the section does is provide that the

11

remedy against the United States is exclusive.

12

the 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 26 -- the 2680(h)

13

provision doesn't apply.

14

mean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to

15

the waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

But what

So I don't see how that -- I

Well, I don't think that

17

that's right.

18

section, you have to read it in context.

19

is that 2680 -- the term "2680(h) of Title 28" doesn't

20

appear elsewhere in the Gonzales Act.

21

I mean, I think, for purposes of this
And the fact

The only work that that provision does in

22

the law, section -- the intentional tort exception,

23

2680(h) of Title 28, the only work that that does is to

24

make the -- is in the Federal Tort Claims Act, is to

25

make the -- the Act inapplicable to those kinds of
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

cases.
So when they say, in simple terms, that

3

shall not apply, all that could mean -- all that could

4

possibly mean is you eliminate that, and then you have

5

the Tort Claims Act how it is.

6

purposes of this section does is say, but we're not

7

doing that across the board for every Federal employee

8

everywhere or even every malpractice case.

9

doing it for the claims that are covered -- for the

And then what the four

We are just

10

cases that are covered in this section -- for purposes

11

of this section.

12

In this section, if you look at (a), then,

13

(a), which is the -- you know, basic exclusive remedy

14

provision that Your Honor mentioned, what (a) does is

15

deal specifically with -- intent with medical

16

malpractice committed by doctors and personnel.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, one of the

18

strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the

19

incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling

20

by this Court.

21

language argument, but how do you address the fact that

22

we will be interpreting, essentially, two statutes that

23

are almost identical, but with different conclusions now, if

24

we were to adopt your view.

25

It's more a policy argument than a

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

I -- I think there

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are -- there are a few reasons why the statutes have to

2

be construed differently.

3

look at the Court's decision in Smith, where it

4

construed that provision of the Westfall Act, it -- the

5

Court never suggested that the language -- the part of

6

the Westfall Act whose language is the same as this

7

supported its conclusion there.

8

provisions in the Westfall Act.

I mean, one is that, if you

It was relying on other

9

In particular, there was a provision that

10

said, "Once the government substitutes itself for the

11

defendant, the case shall proceed, subject to all the

12

exceptions and limitations in the Tort Claims Act."

13

the Court said, well, yes, that -- that gives us a clear

14

understanding that, whether there's exceptions or not,

15

we want that case to proceed -- to proceed.

16

provision isn't here in the Gonzalez Act.

17

And

That

And there was another provision in the

18

Westfall Act -- in the Smith case, in the Westfall Act,

19

that dealt with making a specific exception for Bivens

20

cases.

21

that --

And, again, that provision isn't here.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

Congress want to treat them differently?

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

And

But why -- why would

Right.

I think the reason is,

when they were dealing in this case with this area in
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1976, they were dealing with a specific problem of

2

medical malpractice, and they were looking at that --

3

that problem, doctors, doctors had to get insurance,

4

what are we going to do about that for Federal

5

employees?

6

And they were -- when they focused on that

7

problem -- actually, as the Executive Branch itself said

8

in a letter that was sent to the Senate committee, it

9

said there's an urgent need, both, to assure adequate

10

remedies for tort victims and to protect Federal

11

employees.

12

And that's what they were trying to do here,

13

and I think you see it throughout the Gonzalez Act.

14

But -JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

But why -- why did they

16

feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort

17

victims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

Well --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean -- you know, injured

20

tort victims are injured tort victims.

21

you know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance,

22

Congress would be concerned and, the other, not

23

concerned.

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

It does seem --

I think the difference

is that, here, they were dealing specifically with the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problem of medical malpractice.

2

they got around to the Westfall Act, they weren't

3

looking at medical malpractice.

4

12 years later, when

They were looking, generally, at a whole --

5

the whole problem of government employees being sued

6

after this Court's decision in the Westfall case, a

7

problem that particularly affected, actually, lower

8

level government employees who were -- it's clear,

9

couldn't take advantage of the discretionary function

10
11

exception.
And, when they are looking at the broad

12

universe of employees, they took a different approach

13

and decided, well, we're just going to -- some people

14

are just going to be out of luck because this is the --

15

the determination that Congress made -- felt was

16

appropriate there.

17

But, when it was looking at the specific

18

problem of medical malpractice in the Gonzalez Act, it

19

definitely took the position, as everybody said at the

20

time and as the structure of the Act itself showed, that

21

they wanted to preserve remedies.

22

provisions in the Westfall Act that make that clear --

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there are two

Well, maybe we could address

24

this in slightly more concrete terms.

25

two situations.

You have two --

In one case, a Federal employee who's
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

driving a car deliberately runs somebody down.

2

the second case, a government doctor grabs somebody who

3

doesn't want an operation and performs the operation

4

anyway.

5

And, in

Now, as -- under your reading, there

6

would -- there would be a claim against the government

7

in the second situation, but not in the first situation;

8

is that right?

9

MR. FELDMAN:
JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

That -- that's correct.
Why would Congress want

that?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

The reason they'd want it is

13

this:

14

arose -- that -- that problem came with the Tort Claims

15

Act when it was first enacted in 1946.

16

Congress was looking at the universe of Federal

17

employees, they felt -- and, especially, given the law

18

at that time and that continued really up to the

19

present, that, when a Federal employee or average

20

Federal employee, for the types of intentional torts

21

that they commit, especially a battery, it's

22

extraordinarily unlikely that that's going to be within

23

that scope of that employee's employment.

24
25

In the first situation, that -- that really

And, when

And Congress felt, well, we want to just
eliminate that altogether.

It's not just to hold the
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

government responsible for that kind of a claim, when

2

some Federal clerk slugs someone or something like that,

3

and that was the determination they made.

4

When they got around to 1976, to dealing

5

with the particular problem of medical malpractice,

6

the -- it doesn't actually usually happen -- these kinds

7

of claims don't arise -- I'm not aware of anywhere a

8

doctor just grabs somebody and throws him, physically,

9

into the operating room.

They happen when the doctor is

10

performing some procedure and performs a different

11

procedure or a procedure that was not authorized by the

12

patient.

13

And that -- that is very closely related to

14

core medical malpractice claims of exactly the sort that

15

they were dealing with here.

16

to informed consent claims, which I believe the

17

government -- I read the government to be conceding,

18

could be brought against the government.

19

It's very closely related

And they thought there was no reason to

20

distinguish -- to distinguish one type of medical

21

malpractice from another.

22

we want to provide a remedy, and they all should be

23

brought against the government.

We want all of these claims,

24

I would add one other --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In law review commentaries

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it

2

fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize

3

the battery-negligence distinction as being productive

4

of litigation and not really making a lot of sense?

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that is fair to say,

6

and -- you know, States -- a lot of States have dealt

7

with this by dealing with -- in statutory -- in

8

statutes, not in common law development, so they

9

could kind of rationalize the system and say, look, this

10

is the kinds of claims you're going to have.

11

But the key thing is that everybody in the

12

country, I think, under every State's law, if a doctor

13

performs an operation that you didn't consent to, you

14

have an action in tort.

15

provides an incentive -- an important incentive, to

16

doctors and medical personnel, to be sure that they are

17

only doing what they are authorized to do.

18

And that protects both you and

There is not a hint that, when Congress was

19

dealing with the Westfall Act -- I keep saying, "the

20

Westfall Act" -- when Congress was dealing with the

21

Gonzalez Act, there is not a hint that they were trying

22

there to say, well, we want to save money or something

23

by eliminating those kind of very, very traditional tort

24

claims from those victims, and we don't want those

25

people to have compensation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Feldman, do I

2

understand the mechanics of this right, that, if the

3

injured person sued the United States directly, that

4

suit would fail because the battery exclusion would

5

apply, but it's only by suing the officer -- the doctor

6

and then getting the United States substituted that the

7

battery exception is abrogated; is that right?

8
9

MR. FELDMAN:
that that's correct.

No, I don't -- I don't believe

There is nothing in this Act that

10

says it should make any difference.

11

certainly, in Subsection (e) or anywhere else in the Act

12

that says it should make any difference, whether you are

13

suing the government or suing the -- or suing the -- or

14

suing the doctor.

15

government says, well, we have a defense that the

16

intentional tort exception applies.

17

There is nothing,

If you sue the government, the

You would say, no, it says here, for

18

purposes of this section, the intentional tort exception

19

does not apply.

of this section," is for claims that are covered by this

21

Act, which is claims that are medical tort claims

22

brought against personnel of the affected agencies who

23

are acting within the scope of their authority.

24
25

And what that means, "for the purposes

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

sorry.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Are there any other tort claims besides the

2

lack of consent battery claim at issue here that could

3

be encompassed by the Intentional Tort Act, as it

4

relates to medical malpractice?

5

Let's assume that it's not an operation, but

6

sexual behavior with a patient in their hospital room,

7

something of that nature.

8
9

Is that covered under the Gonzalez Act, as a
claim against the United States?
MR. FELDMAN:

10

If it would be an assault or

11

battery that was committed by -- within the scope of the

12

professional's employment, then it would be.

13

always the question of whether it's within the scope of

14

employment.

But it's

And I think, usually, the -- the case law --

15
16

I mean, I think, usually, the cases are that a doctor

17

who commits a sexual assault on a patient or something

18

is not acting within -- in the kind of circumstances you

19

are talking about, is not acting within the scope of

20

employment.

21

But that would be a case-by-case

22

determination.

23

where -- you know, it would depend on the facts of the

24

case.

25

There might be some kind of case

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This exception you're --

17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

you're talking about is regularly applied in the lower

2

courts?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

What -- I beg your pardon?

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the lower courts,

5

this determination is regularly made?

6

MR. FELDMAN:

The -- the scope of employment

7

determination is made every day because that is made --

8

that is applicable throughout, in any kind of respondeat

9

superior situation, whenever the employer of the medical

10

professional is sued and that kind of thing -- or -- or

11

nonmedical professional, for that matter.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That --

Of course, when the

13

government removes the case, it concedes that point,

14

doesn't it, normally?

15

State court, the government -- the Attorney General must

16

certify that it was within the scope of employment, no?

17

Where a case is removed from

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

That's

18

correct.

And that is actually one of the two -- one of

19

two of the key provisions of the Act, that kind of

20

establish -- that could make it very clear that what

21

Congress was trying to do was preserve remedies because,

22

in that very provision, after it talks about removing

23

when the Attorney General has certified that it's within

24

the scope of employment, it says, "The case can be

25

remanded if the removed case is one such that" there -18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"that no remedy against the United States is available."

2

And what that shows is that Congress knew

3

that there would be actions that would continue to be

4

brought against doctors.

5

provide for that, right there, and say it should be --

6

those should be remanded to State court, and then they

will proceed against the doctor in State court.

Or one of the other

exceptions.

5

They go on, and Congress -- Congress could have closed

all of them down.

7

All of those exception cases, they go on.

And, in fact, if Congress was worried that

8

there would be -- really, if their sole purpose here was

9

to say, we don't want any actions to be brought against

10

Federal employees, they should -- they could have just

11

said, we don't want any actions to be brought against

plausible interpretation?

19

But would you go further and say that it's not a

MR. FELDMAN:

I would.

I think that

20

because, as the court -- when the courts used -- you

21

know, a number of different formulations to -- to talk

22

about that -- I think you are referring to a kind of

23

strict construction rule that -- that applies to waivers

24

of sovereign immunity, which we don't think is

25

applicable here.
20
Alderson Reporting Company

But, even where that rule does apply,

2

really, the question is, is it a reasonable degree of

3

clarity that Congress intended to waive immunity?

4

-- as the Court has said, is it clearly discernible from

5

a fair reading of the statute that they intended to

6

waive?

7

Is it

And it has to be clear, and I think it is

8

clear here.

And that was what everybody at the time of

9

the statute thought.

It's what the government itself

10

thought up through the time of the -- of the Smith case,

11

15 --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

But was the

13

interpretation adopted by the district court and by the

14

Ninth Circuit, but you still say is implausible.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

I think so.

I would add

16

that -- I am not here to defend the Ninth Circuit's

17

judgment, but I would add that they had a pro se

18

litigant before them, and I don't think they had access

19

to the full degree of presentation that they might have

20

had, if -- if it had been more fully developed.

21

But I do think that, when the Court is

22

making that determination of what's clearly discernible

23

from a fair reading of the statute, the Court has also

24

made it clear, though, that what you don't do is take

25

each word in the statute and say, we're going to take
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the most pro-government meaning of this word, and then

2

you add them altogether.

3

What you do is you look at the statute as a

4

whole, you look at the context of the statute, you look

5

at the structure of the statute, and then you say what

6

is plausible, what is clearly discernible from a fair

7

reading.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Feldman, when the

Westfall Act, which doesn't abrogate the intentional

10

tort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there

11

any reason why Congress kept these five or six separate

12

acts, like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, well, we

13

did this piecemeal for particular agencies, and, now, we

14

we’re dealing with Federal employees across the board, so

15

there is no reason why we should have these five or six

16

that go another way?

17

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I can give you the

18

answer that the government gave in its brief in Smith,

19

which is the Gonzalez Act and the other four or five

20

statutes continue to serve two -- at least two vital

21

functions, and one is specifically this:

22

eliminate the -- the intentional tort exception and,

23

therefore, allow relief for victims of intentional tort

24

in this medical malpractice context, just like victims

25

of other kinds of malpractice.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

That they

Official

1

The other thing is there are some cases, for

2

instance, foreign torts, where there is another

3

provision of the Gonzalez Act, 1089(f), that provides

4

for indemnifying or holding harmless doctors, when

5

judgments are against them in certain -- when there's a

6

foreign tort, when the doctor has been detailed to a

7

non-Federal agency, or if the circumstances are such as

8

are likely to preclude a remedy under the Tort Claims

9

Act.

10

So, again, Congress in that -- that

11

provision remains important because there could be a

12

foreign judgment against the doctor or something, even

13

after the Westfall Act, and that would -- that gives the

14

authority to reimburse the doctor, if the agency

15

determines that -- that that's appropriate.

16

But that provision also shows that Congress

17

intended that to preserve remedies here because it would

18

have made no sense for Congress to say, we want to

19

provide for the indemnification or reimbursement of the

20

doctor, if what they really were trying to do was

21

eliminate all the cases against doctors.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feldman, is --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it -Justice --

It's right on the same

23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

thing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am

2

strengthening you -- your last point -- that provision

3

ends, "if the circumstances are such as are likely to

4

preclude the remedies of third persons against the

5

United States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28."

6

That clearly envisions that, in the ordinary

7

case, those remedies against the United States would not

8

be precluded.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

And the -- and

10

the choice that Congress had -- had here, really, was

11

between taking intentional tort cases and allowing them

12

to be continued to be brought against doctors and then

13

subject to this kind of reimbursement provision, which

14

they had provided for, or saying, no, we want these to

15

just be brought against the government and to protect

16

the Federal employees much more fully.

17

the purpose of 1089(e).

18

And so that was

They said, we want to steer this into the

19

same channel that all the other malpractice actions are

20

going into.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feldman, as I understand

22

your argument and -- and the differences that you have

23

with the government, you have one set of differences

24

about the meaning of 1089(e), but then another set about

25

this question of, if it were true that the government
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was immune from suit, could you bring a tort suit

2

against the doctors?

3

And the government said -- says no.

And you

4

say, yes, you might be able to do that.

5

to answer that question, at all, in order to say that

6

you're correct on 1089(e)?

MR. FELDMAN:

8

question isn't at issue in this case.

10
11

against the doctor.

No.

But do you have

I mean, that's -- that
That would really

But --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So there is a lot of going

12

back and forth about this question of what would happen

13

if the government were immune, would the individual

14

doctor be immune?

15

to the question before us; is that correct?

16

But that is, essentially, irrelevant

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I just wouldn't say it's

17

irrelevant because what the -- the provisions that I

18

have been talking about show is that Congress --

19

Congress was not trying, in this Act, unlike in the

20

Westfall Act, which doesn't have either of these two

21

provisions, the reimbursement and remand provision that

22

I've talked about -- unlike in the Westfall Act,

23

Congress wasn't trying to save money or other -- do

24

something else by just eliminating remedies for victims.

25

It was trying to -- as the Executive Branch
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said, as I said, to assure remedies for all tort victims

2

and to protect doctors in a variety of different ways.

3

And given that that's what they were trying to do in the

4

Gonzalez Act, which is clear from the structure, that

5

also helps clarify what 1080 -- or makes more clear what

6

1089(e) means.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Saying it a different way, I

8

don't have to accept your broader argument; I can remain

9

ambivalent about your broader argument and still accept

10

your narrower argument.

11

MR. FELDMAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the

"unequivocally" -- we have a lot of cases that say you

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I think the --

10

the canon actually applies most strongly in this set of

Dolan and the -- and its predecessor cases

recognize that the narrow exception to the canon, when

construing the scope of exceptions that were enacted

to the canon was it didn't want -- the Court didn't want

It's a narrow rule

Unlike those cases, this case is not

5

construing the scope of an exception that was enacted

6

alongside the FTCA that was trying to cut back on the

7

waiver of sovereign immunity.

8

To put it more concretely, on the day before

9

the Gonzalez Act was enacted, there was no question that

10

sovereign immunity barred the type of claim at issue;

11

that is, no one had any dispute that the FTCA's baseline

12

of sovereign immunity applied and would have blocked

13

this claim.

The question is whether --

because, at that point, there was an exception to the

17

exception of sovereign immunity.

MR. SHAH:

stage.

The dispute here is whether Congress
accomplished that objective by, A, assuming the

10

existence of an available tort remedy for purposes of

11

the Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity, as the text of

12

the provision suggests; or, instead, whether it takes

13

the substantial further step of actually amending the

statute and, thereby, provide a remedy against the

16

United States.

okay?

10

And we should interpret that narrowly,

We should interpret that -- absolutely has to be

definite, and it is pretty definite.

11

Now, what we have is an exception to that.

12

And the exception is an exception for battery, but not

13

battery.

14

we're supposed to interpret that, I guess, as broadly as

15

possible.

16

could be broader, you get it, as long as it's plausible.

Can't sue the United States for battery.

17

And

If you have a plausible argument that it

Then what we have -- because, after all,

That's the point of what -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't find it all

What it says is that this battery

but it says, "for purposes of this section."

look at "for purposes of this section," and the purposes

12

of this section -- the very first whole sentence has to

13

do with 1089.

14

do with the general waiver.

It has to do with the scope.

MR. SHAH:

15

Okay.

I

It has to

Well, the "for purposes of this

16

section" language, I think, is the key phrase, and this

section refers to the Gonzalez Act.

all about, are about conferring personal immunity.

I don't think those are the

I think the key words are "shall not apply."

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It isn't shall be deemed

40

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, I think, when we are

reading it --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is not a hypothetical.

5

It says, "They shall not apply to any cause of action,"

6

etc.

7

MR. SHAH:

I think, when we are reading it

8

against the canon -- the sovereign immunity canon, I

9

think we would expect Congress to speak more clearly.

10

And Congress gave us two examples of how it spoke more

11

clearly in this very context.

12

One is, in 1974, the sole -- the only time

13

it amended Section 2680(h), it amended it within the --

14

the provision itself; that is, it amended the language

15

of 2680(h) to add a law enforcement proviso that said,

16

"This exception applies except with respect to law

17

enforcement in certain circumstances."

18

That's one way --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

But why?

Why would

20

they have wanted to do that?

That is to say, look, if

21

you cut the exception to the exception to the exception,

22

the presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got

23

on your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a

24

battery committed by a government official, given your

25

interpretation, has no remedy at all.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

1

previously, he could have at least sued in State court.

2

MR. SHAH:

Well --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what you're saying is

4

Congress tried to do with this language is say, hey, you

5

can't sue in State court; and, by the way, when you try

6

to sue the Federal government, we are not going to give

7

you your suit, either.

8
9

MR. SHAH:

Why do that?
Well, Your Honor, I don't

think -- I don't think that's true.

I think before --

10

before the Gonzalez Act came along, there was a split in

11

the circuits.

12

There were -- there were circuits that did not allow a

13

claim to proceed personally against the physician.

14

That's why the Gonzalez Act came along.

There were circuits that recognized absolute

15

immunity against a personal suit, even while it was

16

undisputed that battery claim could not proceed against

17

the government.

18

That -- and what -- what Congress said, if

19

you want to look at legislative history, what the Senate

20

Report says is, in light of this D.C. Circuit decision

21

that went the other way, Congress enacted the Gonzalez

22

Act because it was primarily concerned about conferring

23

personal immunity.

24

Every time the Senate Report talks about the

25

purpose of the bill -- it's on page 1, heading, "Purpose
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the Bill" -- it says conferring personal immunity,

2

nothing about expanding the government's tort liability.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shah, this is not

4

always the government's position.

In fact, in a brief

5

to this Court, in the Smith case, the government took

6

the position that Mr. Feldman is presenting to us.

7

What occurred to turn on the light for the

8

government, to see that it was wrong in the Smith case

9

and come up with this -- the interpretation you are now

10

advancing?

11

MR. SHAH:

Sure, Justice Ginsburg.

Well,

12

the first thing I would say is that Section 1089(e) was

13

not directly at issue in Smith, and the issue had really

14

been litigated quite sparsely, both before and after

15

Smith.

16

Once this case presented itself, the

17

government revisited its position.

18

two --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think there were

But this is not a side

20

issue, Mr. Shah.

21

of 1089(e) as an argument to produce that the result this

22

Court reached in Smith, so it was -- it was not a very

23

large issue, but it was -- it was an argument.

24
25

In fact, you used your understanding

You said -- you know, we should reach the
result that we -- that you wanted in Smith because
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1089(e) would continue to have this effect.

2

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I don't agree

3

with that characterization.

4

would have been identical, with or without 1089(e).

5

I don't want to quibble about --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The government's argument
But

It was a supportive

7

argument.

I am not saying that it was the but-for

8

argument, but it was clearly a supportive argument in

9

your brief.

10

MR. SHAH:

11

it that way, I think that's fine.

argument was to support that position.

Your position would

Your Honor, I agree.

supported that position --

times in its opinion.

MR. SHAH:

I don't believe the Court --

4
5

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We certainly -- we

certainly cited Smith.

6

MR. SHAH:

Yes, but the Court did not

7

interpret 1089(e).

I think Smith -- what Smith

8

hopefully said, Your Honor -- and this is one of the

9

reasons why the government revisited its position --

10

what the Court said in the Smith decision -- you don't

11

have to take my word of what the legislative history

12

says.

13

What the -- what the Court in Smith itself

14

said is that the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- not

15

the primary purpose, not a purpose, not a chief

16

purpose -- the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- and

17

it's talking about the Gonzalez Act as a whole -- was to

18

confer personal immunity and not to create malpractice

19

rights in favor of plaintiffs.

20

What Justice Ginsburg --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

friend says that, in Smith -- I'm sorry for the

23

confusion -- the Court addressed your argument on the

24

meaning of the Gonzalez Act several times.

25

MR. SHAH:

Your friend -- your

Your Honor, it did not address
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1089(e) at all, and -- and I think that's plain as day

2

from -- from the opinion.

3

is that the purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- the sole

4

purpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer personal

5

immunity.

6

does not create malpractice rights in favor of

7

plaintiff.

And what it also said is the Gonzalez Act

What the Court said in Smith

Well, you did -- you did

16

claims against the United States."

This was rather a central theory for your interpretation

2

of the Act; maybe not the only theory, but a central

3

theory.

MR. SHAH:

I -- again, I -- I disagree,

5

fundamentally, with that characterization.

It's two

sentences in our brief.

The Court did not rely on it at all in Smith.

It's at the back end of the

It was not fundamental to the position in Smith.

9

But, even if all that were true, I think the

10

important thing is why we changed our position.

11

is -- the first and foremost is the statements in the

12

Court's decision in Smith itself, which, obviously,

13

post-dated our brief --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The one

I don't find that

15

inconsistent with the position argued.

talking about the statement that the sole purpose was --

The two statements, the sole

purpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer immunity,

sole purpose, even if you -- you accept your friend's

interpretation.

MR. SHAH:

But, no --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no.

Alderson Reporting Company

The sole purpose

Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to

I think you could still say the sole

purpose was to help the doctors.

11

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I would

12

disagree with that.

The other side's brief says, all

13

along, the sole purpose of this Act was not just to

14

confer personal immunity, but it had a dual purpose.
The dual purpose was to confer personal

15
16

immunity -- and this is, time and time again, in the

17

other side's brief -- to -- to confer personal immunity

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would -- why would

22

Congress -- I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came

23

25

Why would Congress want to provide this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

battery remedy if a Veterans Administration medical

2

person messed up, but not if it was an armed service

3

doctor?

4

MR. SHAH:

Of course, Congress doesn't say.

5

I think there are two potential reasons, Justice

6

Ginsburg.

7

recognized, the special solicitude that Congress pays

8

veterans, and it may have wanted to open up remedies to

9

veterans that were unavailable to others.

10

One might be the -- as -- as this Court has

I think the second potential reason is the

11

defense side reasons.

12

cases are civilian Veterans Administration employees.

13

In a Gonzalez Act case, by and large, the defendants are

14

going to be active military personnel.

15

often hesitant to create -- expand judicial remedies

16

against active military personnel because of the risk it

17

poses to interfering with military function and order.

18

The defendants in Veterans Act

Congress is

So I think those are two reasons why

19

Congress may have decided to -- to change course in the

20

Veterans Act in 1988, after it had four provisions that

21

said exactly the same thing, using the four purposes of

22

this Act provision, it changed it, and it must have

23

changed it for a reason.

24
25

Two potential reasons are to change the
result, which, of course, under which the government
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would win; or because it think -- it thought it needed

2

to speak more clearly, in order to waive sovereign

3

immunity.

4

immunity waivers, the government would also prevail.

5

And, under the presumption against sovereign

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shah, your basic theory

6

of the case, which is that, in order to make absolutely

7

certain that everyone gets the benefit of the

8

intentional tort exception, both the government and

9

individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely

10

clear, Congress writes a provision saying that the

11

intentional tort exception shall not apply.

12

Now -- I mean, the -- the position, I have

13

to say, seems to refute itself.

14

make absolutely clear that the intentional tort

15

exception would apply, it wouldn't have written a

16

provision saying that it doesn't apply.

17

MR. SHAH:

If Congress wanted to

Well, the provision that you

18

describe, Justice Kagan, is not this provision.

19

the 1988 Veterans Act amendment, which says the

20

intentional tort exception shall not apply.

21

provision says, "for purposes of this section," that is,

22

for purposes of the Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity

23

in Subsection (a), that the -- the intentional tort

24

exception shall not apply.

25

It's

This

Now, sometimes, when Congress uses the four
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purposes of this section's formulation, sometimes, it

2

uses words like "assume that" or "consider that," as

3

it -- as cited in the other side's brief, in footnote 4,

4

on page 18.

5

purposes of this section," even though it intends

6

somewhat of a counterfactual inquiry, it eliminates

7

those words.

However, other times, when it uses "for

8

In Title 10 itself, Section 10 USC 335 says,

9

"for purposes of this section" -- the exact language is,

10

"For purposes of this chapter, the term 'State' includes

11

Guam and the Virgin Islands."

12

Now, there's no dispute that Congress was

13

not trying to add Guam and the Virgin Islands as the

14

51st and 52nd States of the Union.

15

when applying the provisions of this section, treat Guam

16

and Virgin Islands as if they are States.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So --

Would you -- are you

finished there?

Yes, sir.

20

22

the Gonzalez Act -- and think of the millions of

MR. SHAH:

The theory behind the individual

immunity was the same -- essentially, the same theory
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

behind the Westfall Act immunity that this Court

2

rejected in the Westfall Act decision.

3

Westfall, there was an argument that there was absolute

immunity, that -- that the individual government

5

employees had absolute immunity.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

It was a common law immunity

that -- it was an offshoot of the sovereign immunity,

11

said -- you know, that immunity doesn't apply, unless

12

you are talking about both beings in the scope of

13

employment and that apply -- that involve discretionary

14

policy decisions at a high enough level.
The last point I would make, Your Honor, is,

And I think you can look at this Court's

The statutory provision in that case made

20
21

certain Bankruptcy Court determinations binding on the

22

government, "notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign

23

immunity."

24

footnote 10, on page 41 of our brief.

25

The relevant language is reproduced on

That language, "notwithstanding any
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assertion of sovereign immunity," sounds awfully like a

2

waiver of sovereign immunity.

3

But what this Court said, in applying the unequivocal

4

waiver requirement, in finding that there was no waiver

5

of sovereign immunity, despite that very explicit

6

language, was that the statute, nonetheless, performed a

7

significant function.

8
9

It seems pretty explicit.

Here, the same is true.

Section 1089(e),

though not authorizing monetary relief, still

10

undisputedly performs a function here.

11

function of securing the personal immunity conferred by

12

Section 1089(a), that is, for purposes of the Gonzalez

13

Act, the conferral of immunity under Section 1089(a).

14

It performs a

Just -- just as in Nordic Village, that is

15

enough to construe the statute against a waiver of

16

sovereign immunity.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you want us to

18

decide the case with the unequivocal question before us,

19

20

government applies in this type of case.

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me to be

23

you are really upping the ante here, and it may well --

I have no idea why the government took the opposite

25

position below, but that's -- that's putting a lot more

1

at stake in this case than the particular statutory

2

position.

3

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, there are four

4

courts that have decided -- conclusively spoken -- to my

5

knowledge, four courts, in the history, that have

6

interpreted this provision, Section 1089(e).

7

come out in the government's favor.

8

district court decisions before the Smith case.

9

came out in the government's favor.

All have

There were two
Both

The only two decisions I am aware of are the

10
11

two decisions in this case, conclusively interpreting

12

1089(e), the district court and the court of appeals.

13

Both courts in this case relied on the unequivocal

14

waiver requirement.

15

a stretch, at all, to apply the unequivocal waiver canon

16

here.

17

And I think that that's -- it's not

In fact, this case is far afield from Dolan.

18

It would be a substantial expansion of the narrow

19

exception in Dolan to say that the unequivocal waiver

20

requirement didn't apply.

21

sovereign immunity applied the day before the Gonzalez

22

Act was enacted.

23

There was no dispute that

So the only question is whether the Gonzalez

24

Act enacts a new waiver of sovereign immunity.

25

the type of situation in which the canon applies most
55
Alderson Reporting Company

That is

Official

1
2

strongly.
And Congress did it in a separate statute.

3

Again, in Dolan, we were interpreting provisions that

4

everyone agreed were part and parcel of the FTCA that --

5

that altered the balance of sovereign immunity.

6

the question is whether it even affects or amends the

7

FTCA in the first place, whether it means to affect the

8

sovereign immunity balance in the first place.

9
10
11

Here,

That's an especially strong case in which we
would want an unequivocal waiver requirement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shah, does it make

12

any sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice,

13

negligence and this unconsented operation, to split

14

those two and say the government is liable for

15

malpractice, but not for this unconsented action.

16

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, I think it makes a

17

lot of sense, and here's why:

18

intentional tort exception itself in 1946, one of the

19

principal reasons it -- it did that was because

20

intentional tort claims are sometimes easier to allege

21

but more difficult to disprove.

22

When Congress enacted the

That is particularly true with respect to

23

these sort of lack of consent claims, where you have a

24

patient who has signed consent forms, agreed to a

25

surgery, and says -- and the facts of this case, I
56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

think, are illustrative -- says right before the

2

anesthesia kicked in, "I said I don't want the procedure

3

anymore."

4

Now, here, the government was successful in

5

winning on summary judgment dismissal of the actual

6

medical negligence claim, that the doctor's standard of

7

care didn't -- that the doctor's care didn't meet the

8

standard of care.

9

The government won summary judgment on that

10

because there -- there was no evidence -- no expert

11

testimony that supported Petitioner's claim.

12

claim that, "I said no right before the anesthesia

13

kicked in," survived summary judgment.

14

But his

And I think it was correct to survive

15

summary judgment, but the problem is that that survived

16

summary judgment, even though the deposition testimony,

17

as pointed out in the government's brief, everyone else

18

in the operating room, including the doctor, said that

19

this patient did not so object, just shows that these

20

claims --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Shah, can I ask you

22

why -- if your interpretation is correct, Subsection (e)

23

24

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I just wanted to make a

20

couple of quick points.

One is the Court has not

21

applied the clear statement -- the unequivocal statement

22

standard at any time in the Tort Claims Act, not just

23

when it's dealing with exceptions, but, if you go back

24

to the very early cases, the Aetna case, the Yellow Cab

25

case, really, right after the Act was passed, you can
58
Alderson Reporting Company

1

see that the Court is saying there, no, we want to

2

interpret this Act to -- consistent with Congress's

3

intent, the way it wanted it interpreted, which is with

4

a fair reading of its words, not in one direction, not

5

in the other.

6

I just also wanted to clarify, in the Smith

7

case because, of a possible misunderstanding, the Court

8

definitely addressed the Gonzales Act, repeatedly, in

9

its opinion in the Smith case, but it didn't -- the

10
11

Court did not actually address 1089(e).
The reason the government, though -- this

12

was important to the government, and, actually, the

13

government's reply brief in the Smith case was, I think,

14

a hundred percent about the Gonzales Act -- was that the

15

other side of the Gonzales Act was saying, if you

16

construe the Westfall Act the way the government wants,

17

that will be an implied repeal, but the Gonzales Act

18

will have nothing left to do.

19

And it was important for the government --

20

that's why they kept saying it.

21

the government to say, no, the Gonzales Act does have

22

things to do, this is not an implied repeal.

23

the things it does is exactly what we say Section

24

1089(e) does.

25

It was important for
