ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This is a Sixth Circuit habeas appeal

11

involving AEDPA deference.

12

that a Federal court may only overturn a State court

13

conviction that is such an erroneous misapplication of

14

this Court's clearly established precedent as to be

15

beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement, that

16

is, an extreme malfunction.

17

Harrington v. Richter holds

Here, a fair-minded jurist could conclude

18

that the Michigan Supreme Court's Carpenter decision was

19

neither indefensible, nor unexpected, when it simply

20

applied plain statutory language in accord with

21

well-established Michigan interpretive principles.

22

Accordingly, the Michigan Court of Appeals

23

application of Carpenter was not error, and the Sixth

24

Circuit should be reversed.

25

I'd like to begin with the statutory text.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In 1975, the Michigan legislature passed a comprehensive

2

mental capacity affirmative defense statute.

3

defenses are defined for mental illness and mental

4

retardation, but it says nothing about diminished

5

capacity.

6

In it, the

And that silence is crucial here because, in

7

Michigan, for over 200 years, it has been a code

8

jurisdiction, which means that, if the statutes address

9

a particular area of criminal law, only that statute

10

applies, and the Michigan courts are not allowed to

11

either add to or subtract from that statutory text.

12
13

So only the Michigan legislature had the
power to add a diminished capacity defense.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Well, what -200 years -- 200 years?

Did you say that?
MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

Actually, even before

18

Michigan was a territory -- I'm -- before it was a

19

State, in 1810, it passed a law that abolished common

20

law criminal principles when there was a statute that

21

addressed the -- the subject matter.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was some law in

23

effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973

24

till the year 2001.

25

no ancient common law.

There was no statute, and there was
But what was it?
4

Alderson Reporting Company

If I asked you

Official

1

the question, what was the law in Michigan on diminished

2

capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you respond?

3

MR. BURSCH:

It changed one time.

In 1973,

4

there was a Michigan Court of Appeals decision that

5

recognized, as a matter of common law, the diminished

6

capacity defense, but that was set aside by the 1975

7

statute, which established all the comprehensive

8

diminished capacity defenses available and left out

9

diminished capacity.

10

So in 1975, 1976 -- you know, 1978 --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How -- how was the

12

Michigan Court of Appeals construing the defense?

13

it say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute.

14

MR. BURSCH:

Did

Well, what the Michigan Court

15

of Appeals did, beginning in 1978, in the Mangiapane

16

case, was to ask, is diminished capacity part of the

statutory code?

diminished capacity defense.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was the 1973 case that you

4

allegedly, a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed

5

the court to fill?

6

case came about?

7

other courts?

8
9

I mean, is that the way the 1973
And was the 1973 case followed by

Or was it just an isolated precedent?

MR. BURSCH:

The 1973 case was a common law

vacuum, Justice Kennedy, where the Michigan legislature

10

had not yet spoken about mental incapacity defenses, and

11

so it stood alone, as the court was able to do, as a

12

common law decision.

13

There were no other cases that relied on it

14

before the '75 statute was enacted.

15

point, the Michigan appellate courts did not look to the

16

'72 decision as the source of the doctrine.

17

assumed that, if it existed, it must be somewhere within

18

the statute.

19

And, after that

They

And then, in Carpenter, in 2001, the

20

Michigan Supreme Court, when, finally, the very first

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we don't --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Please.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we don't really have

6

to reach this issue in this case, according to your

7

submission, but what would happen if a State -- an

8

intermediate State appellate court said the law is

9

such-and-such and then a -- a person is tried in the

10

interim -- is tried and, subsequently, the State supreme

11

court says that intermediate State court decision was

12

incorrect, that never was the law of this State; the law

13

was exactly the opposite?

14

MR. BURSCH:

I think you would apply the

15

same principles to that hypothetical as you did in

16

Rogers, and -- and, in Rogers, you had a nearly 100-year

17

common law history of the year and a day rule in the

18

Tennessee Supreme Court, that the defense was available

19

to use that term for nearly 100 years, and, yet, it

20

didn't violate due process in Rogers for the Tennessee

21

Supreme Court to abolish the rule because it was neither

22

indefensible nor unexpected.

23

Now, this case is much easier than Rogers or

24

your hypothetical, for several reasons.

25

mentioned, it's a habeas case, and so we've got the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

First, as I

Official

1

layer of AEDPA deference that wasn't there.

2

Second, we're not talking about the

3

evolution of the common law, like we were in Rogers.

4

We're talking about a statute, and the statute meant

5

what it said in '75, just like it did in '01, just like

6

it does today.

7

And the last thing is that, in the Rogers

8

case, even the Tennessee Supreme Court acknowledged

9

there was a change.

And, here, the Michigan Supreme

10

Court said there was no change because the statute said

11

what it said in 1975, and that meant no diminished

12

capacity.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what I'm wondering is

14

how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a

15

State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the

16

State.

17

law of the State?

18

says?

19

Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the
Isn't that what our decision in Fiore

If the State supreme court says, this is the

20

law, and it's always been the law, then how can we

21

second-guess that?

22

MR. BURSCH:

23

think about it in -- in two pieces.

24

is can you second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court's

25

interpretation of the statute?

Well, Justice Alito, I would
And the first piece

And I think the answer

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there, everybody has to agree, is no.

2

interpretation of its own statute binds this Court,

3

binds all Federal courts, just like the South Carolina

4

Supreme Court decision in -- in Bouie did.

5

The State's

With respect to the Michigan Supreme Court's

6

analysis of the retroactive effect, I agree that Fiore

7

stands for that very proposition, and I think Indiana

8

makes that case very forcefully in the multi-State amici

9

brief.

10

You don't have to reach that question here,

11

however, because given the AEDPA standard and the fact

12

that the Michigan Supreme Court decision was so clearly

13

not a misapplication of Rogers and Bouie, it makes this

14

a relatively easy case.

15
16
17

But I think you'd be fully within your right
to follow the Fiore holding.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

You -- you suggested,

18

General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory

19

makes your position easier.

20

MR. BURSCH:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
And I wonder if that's true.

22

I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other

23

way, which suggests that we all understand that common

24

law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare

25

for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

means and that that's not foreseeable in the same way.

2

So -- now, especially if it were a single

3

court, saying the statute means A today, and then,

4

tomorrow, it comes back, and it says, no, it means B,

5

whether that isn't actually -- whether that wouldn't cut

6

against your position.

7

MR. BURSCH:

Justice Kagan, I think this is

8

the easiest case because it's not just statutory

9

interpretation; it's statutory interpretation of a

10

statute that is just plain on its face.

11

ambiguous statute, yes, then maybe there would be some

12

more uncertainty.

13

If you had an

But where you've got a statute that

14

enumerates several defenses, does not include diminished

15

capacity, and, under Michigan law, if it's not

16

enumerated, it's not there, and the courts can't add it.

17

That does make this easier.

18

I think it was probably a bigger challenge

19

in Rogers, for example, to acknowledge that, one,

20

Tennessee law had changed right out from underneath the

21

defendant; and, yet, even given that change, this Court

22

was comfortable that it was not indefensible or

23

unexpected.

24

I think when --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What about the Michigan

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court of Appeals?

2

right?

There's only one court of appeals,

3

MR. BURSCH:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Correct, Justice Ginsburg.
And so that court,

5

several times, recognized diminished capacity as a

6

defense.

7

MR. BURSCH:

Well, it -- it didn't recognize

8

it as a defense, in the sense that it analyzed the

9

statute and said, yes, the defense is available.

It, in

10

many instances, assumed that it might exist, and, if it

11

did, then this is the result.

12

The closest it comes is this Mangiapane

13

decision in 1978, and the court says, very specifically,

14

there that the definition of mental illness in the

15

statute is similar to diminished capacity, but the court

16

says, at page 247 of the Northwest Second Report, the

17

court was not prepared to say they are identical.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

of which would be contrary to the statutory language,

2

incidentally, not a single one of them did a conviction

3

or an acquittal or a finding of ineffective assistance

4

ever turn on that point.

5

also, again, very much like Rogers, where this Court

6

said that the year and a day rule had never been used

7

for an acquittal or a conviction in any Tennessee case.

8
9

And so, in that sense, it's

And so the question is, again, through the
AEDPA deference lens, which is very high, was the

10

Carpenter decision defensible and expected?

11

would submit that any time that a State supreme court

12

applies the plain language of the statute in accord with

13

established principles of interpretation in that State,

14

it could almost never be indefensible or unexpected.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we

That seems a little

16

strange, for the following reason -- just as I think

17

this case presents an example, you're claiming it's

18

clear because the supreme court said it was clear, but

19

the court of appeals in -- in Mangiapane, whether or not

20

it assumed it or not, did an analysis that clearly says

21

that it believes that the definition of legal insanity

22

includes diminished capacity.

23

Its holding didn't need that analysis,

24

because it could have assumed it and then just said, but

25

no notice was given, so the defense fails here.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

It took

Official

1

the time to analyze just this question and came to a

2

contrary conclusion.

3

"legal insanity" was a broad enough term under Michigan

4

law to encompass this defense.

5

Its contrary conclusion was that

The court of -- the State supreme court has

6

now said, no, it's not.

7

makes the statute any less ambiguous, merely because a

8

court announces that it thinks it's not.

9

MR. BURSCH:

But I don't know that that

Well, two responses to that,

Justice Sotomayor.

careful about what Mangiapane actually held.

12

look at the statutory language and, at page 247, said,

13

"We are not prepared to say they are identical," meaning

14

the definition of mental illness and the concept of

15

diminished capacity.

16

First, I want to be, again, very
It did

There, the question was procedural because

17

the defendant had not given the prosecutor notice of any

18

defense, based on mental capacity in the trial court,

19

and so the court said, well -- you know, assuming that

20

the -- the defense exists, we are not prepared to decide

21

that today --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

give statutory notice.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I would have thought

2

your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have

3

thought your first response to -- to the question would

4

have been to deny that you say it's clear because the

5

supreme court of Michigan has said so.

6

argument is it's clear because it's clear.

7
8

MR. BURSCH:

I thought your

second point.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ah, okay.

It should have been your

first point.

13

saying it was clear because the statute's clear.

14

The premise is simply wrong.

MR. BURSCH:

It was clear.

You're

And if any

15

Michigan court had had the opportunity to actually

clear.

decision is most defensible and most expected, applying

20

the plain language of a clear statute in accord with

21

State principles.

22

And so this is the point when a State court

MR. BURSCH:

Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware

of -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This statute is -- fairly

4

5

that diminished capacity is not a defense.

6

MR. BURSCH:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.
I'm just curious to know

8

if any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion

9

under a statute like this.

10

MR. BURSCH:

I'm not aware of any other

11

States that have the same statute and have addressed the

12

question one way or the other.

13

language of the Michigan statute is fairly unique.

14

you look in the criminal law treatises, we're kind of in

15

a category of only a very few States that -- you know,

16

on the one hand, define mental illness and mental

17

retardation, do not define or mention diminished

18

capacity, and, yet, still have this guilty, but insane

19

option, which is something that Michigan common law did

20

not have, but then that was added in the '75 statute.

21

So it's a little bit unique.

22

I do know that the
If

I think it's also unique to Michigan that we

23

have this 200-year criminal code history, which, if

you're interested, you can read all about it in the In

re Lamphere case that we cite on page 4 to 5 of our
15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

reply brief.

2

together that really make this such an easy case.

3

But it's when you put those things

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, General, I guess I

4

wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really

5

says, as opposed to what courts said it says.

6

sometimes, judges make errors, and our law is dotted

7

with places where courts have made errors and said that

8

things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they

9

do mean, and -- you know, we expect people to follow

I mean,

10

what the court says is the law, even if there's really a

11

better reading out there.

12

And, also, we think that people should rely

13

on what the court says is the law, even though there's

14

really a better reading out there.

15

what does it matter if we come out and said -- and

16

say -- you know, what were these crazy Michigan courts

17

doing?

18
19
20

And so -- you know,

If that's what they were doing, it seems as
though people had a right to rely on that.
MR. BURSCH:

Well, the expectation,

21

certainly, is that people would rely on Michigan

22

statutory law.

23

difficult case if the Michigan Supreme Court in, say,

24

1990 had come out in a published opinion and said the

25

exact opposite of what it said in 2001.

And I concede that this would be a more

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Obviously,

Official

1
2

that's not what happened here.
But -- but ultimately -- you know, the

3

question that would have been on -- on Mr. Lancaster's

4

mind back in 1993 when he shot and killed Toni King was,

5

does Michigan law prohibit me -- will it punish me if

6

I -- I kill someone?

7

And -- and, clearly, he had to know that.

8

And, if he had looked at the 1975 statute, he would have

9

seen that diminished capacity was not mentioned there.

10

So to the extent that he -- he wanted to rely on that

11

defense, he wouldn't have found it in Michigan's

12

codified law.

13

Now, I know the argument on the other side

14

is, well, we have these other cases which -- you know,

15

mention the doctrine, kind of assume without deciding

16

that -- that it's out there.

17

that he has all the knowledge of that, but not the

18

knowledge of the background principle that Michigan

19

won't add affirmative defenses to a statute through a

20

judicial action.

21

And he wants to assume

And, if you're going to impute any knowledge

22

to him -- and -- and we submit that you probably

23

shouldn't, then you've got to impute all the knowledge

24

of Michigan law, the plain language of the statute and

25

the interpretive principles that should guide what that
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

statute means.
He knew that killing someone was wrong,

3

unquestionably, he was on fair notice of that.

4

and just like in Rogers, this diminished capacity

5

defense after 1975 was never relied on by any Michigan

6

court to either hold someone guilty or to acquit them or

7

to find that there was ineffective assistance.

8

was not the kind of well-established principle that

9

could possibly make the Carpenter decision either

10

And --

It just

indefensible or unexpected.

11

And then, when you layer that on top with

12

AEDPA deference -- you know, really, this is about as

simple as it gets.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. MOGILL

MR. MOGILL:

Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse

me -- and may it please the Court:
At the time of his offense in this matter,
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Respondent had a well-established, uncontested right to

2

present evidence of diminished capacity in order to

3

negate the elements of premeditation and deliberation in

4

the first-degree murder charge against him, and he did

5

assert that defense at his first trial.

6

rendered unfair by the prosecutor's Batson error.

7

That trial was

Respondent was not allowed to present the

8

same defense at his retrial, however, because, 8 years

9

after his offense, the Michigan Supreme Court

10

unexpectedly changed the rules in midstream, holding in

11

Carpenter that a statute that had been enacted 26 years

12

before and that did not use the words "diminished

13

capacity" did not express an intent to abolish any

14

defense of diminished capacity, but the Supreme Court

15

held that it had been abolished.

16

That was fundamentally unfair to Respondent,

17

all the more so, because, if the Michigan courts had

18

ruled correctly on the Batson issue, retrial would have

19

occurred before 2001, and there's no question, but that

20

Respondent would have been able to raise the diminished

21

mitigates the crime.

Once that case was decided, there is one

direction only in Michigan law from 1973 until

5

Carpenter, by surprise, in 2001.

The phrasing in the -- in the court's

opinion is very significant and it's much more than

opposing counsel suggests.

"we find that the" -- "the defense known as diminished

insanity."

15

The court stated explicitly,

Once that happened, then that required an

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think the question that

was asked was, at the bottom line, at the end of the

Yes.
-- did anybody get

Did it affect the outcome?

You gave a

10

case where a defendant was allowed to raise diminished

11

capacity, but was -- are there cases where the defense

12

was successful on the merits?

13

MR. MOGILL:

Justice Ginsburg, I think

14

that's a very important question.

15

can come -- the first part of my answer is, in the

16

Griffin case, in 1989, in an order which was a

17

dispositive order and, therefore, was precedent, the

18

Michigan Supreme Court disposed of an application for

19

leave to appeal by remand --

20

case for an ineffective assistance hearing because of

21

defense counsel's failure, inter alia, to consider a

22

diminished capacity defense.

That order could not have occurred unless

24

the supreme court had determined that diminished

25

capacity was a valid defense.

The second part --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or -- is that correct?

2

Wouldn't -- wouldn't the supreme court have done that if

3

it -- if it thought that at least -- at least it was

4

arguable?

5

MR. MOGILL:

I -- I respectfully submit

6

that, under Strickland analysis, no.

7

not an established defense, if it's not something that

8

would, arguably, come within the Strickland framework,

9

there would not have been a remand.

If it -- if it's

That would have

10

been a -- a question of a lawyer trying to be creative,

11

but it wouldn't implicate Strickland principles.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm -- I'm a little

13

surprised at your answer, and Justice Scalia's question

14

indicates the same.

15

you say it was in the appellate courts, then it seems to

16

me, certainly, counsel should raise it and is arguably

17

deficient for not doing so.

prevail at the end of the day is something quite

19

different.

20

If the law was as well settled as

MR. MOGILL:

Whether or not he'll

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

21

believe that the basis for a remand in a case like

22

this -- and this is not an unusual kind of a situation

23

in practice, is where the law is clear, then you -- then

24

the remand is to determine the factual basis for the

that the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals here

was objectively unreasonable.

16

unreasonable ruling for the reasons that it was

18

want to weave into this the second part of what I'd like

19

to answer of Justice Ginsburg's question.

20

And, whether it's beyond

I think it's very important in understanding

21

the question of reversals or not what the lay of the

22

land was because, where you have a framework that allows

a defense to be raised and prosecutors aren't objecting,

the -- the application's going to be a factual matter

So it's not going to be something that's

2

going to percolate up into appellate legal issues.

3

going to be successful sometimes, it's not going to be

4

successful sometimes, and there are no statistics on

5

that.

6

and that's in no small part why the question of, well,

7

what about a reversal --

But it doesn't -- it won't present a legal issue,

It's

JUSTICE ALITO:

In Griffin -- you describe

Griffin in your brief as follows:

encompassed by the statutory scheme which requires

advanced notice.

that such evidence wasn't admissible, the prosecutor had

instructions, people tend to follow it.

22

So it's not surprising that a lot of people tended to

23

follow it.

I agree the bar puts it in the

That's true.

But, as far as court decisions are
concerned, we have no -- what I'm trying to think of is

That's Lynch.

sort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner.

4

We've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong,

5

and -- and, here, even though there are judicial

6

mentioners, they get something.

I give you a little credit on that.
Pre-statute -- and we have what I might

I don't know how much in the scale to -- to
give them.

9

MR. MOGILL:

Well, with all due respect, the

10

standard that this Court set in Rogers is whether the --

11

the decision in Carpenter, in this case, would have been

12

unforeseeable and indefensible by reference to the law

13

as previously expressed so that it could be applied

14

retroactively.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you think of a Federal

16

case where -- I see what we have.

17

something for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is

18

a -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that

19

some courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to

20

follow it, and there were others that mentioned it

21

favorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.

22
23

MR. MOGILL:

No, the Michigan Supreme Court

did mention it favorably as well.

24
25

I'm now adding up the

JUSTICE BREYER:
favorably.

Okay.

Alright, it did mention it

So -- so we've got that.

Now, actually,

that Kentucky case, was it?

MR. MOGILL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Rogers?
Yeah, Rogers.

That went

against you.

Tennessee?

MR. MOGILL:

I think the principle that the

Court established there was very much --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Alright.

Alright.

But

8

can you think of any Federal precedent on this issue

9

that's come even close to that being sufficient?

10

What's

your best?

11

MR. MOGILL:

I think the closest point --

12

and it's important, and it goes, Justice Scalia, to

13

respond to your point about lower court -- reliance on

14

lower court opinions, is in Lanier, when the question

15

concerned what's the scope of the statute that's at

16

issue here.

17

And this Court very explicitly stated that

18

its permissible for the world outside of court to look

19

at lower court decisions, court of appeals decisions, in

20

terms of what had been reasonably expressed.

21

consistent --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's

If you -- if you prevail

23

here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme

24

courts.

25

until courts of appeals have issued their opinions.

State supreme courts, much like us, they wait

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

They wait to see how the practical application of those

2

works, insofar as of the fairness of the trial.

3

wait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then

4

they -- and then they take the case.

5

They

If you prevail, State supreme courts

6

are -- are going to say -- you know, if we don't take

7

this case, even though it's -- does not present the

8

issue as clearly as some late case might, we don't rush

9

in, then we're going to be foreclosed.

I think you're

10

proposing a dynamic which makes the Federal courts

11

intrude on the way in which State courts choose to

12

develop their law.

13

MR. MOGILL:

Justice Kennedy, thank you for

14

that question, but I respectfully disagree.

15

we are requesting here is simply that, while the

16

Michigan Supreme Court was entirely free to interpret

17

this statute any way it wanted to prospectively, so long

18

as it didn't conflict with some other decision of this

19

Court, the question is, what about applying it

20

retroactively?

21

The relief

And this Court in Bouie and Rogers has set

22

out clear principles for when a court that wants to

reverse ground can do that or not, consistent with

fundamental fairness, principles of notice,

MR. MOGILL:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. MOGILL:

What is the unfairness here?

There's not a reliance, nor is

that an element --

I'm sorry?

Do you think there's a reliance?

Well, what is the

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the -- so what is

the unfairness here?

12

MR. MOGILL:

In both -- in both Bouie and

13

Rogers, this Court made it clear that reliance is not an

14

issue.

15

point, Justice Alito -- is that by eliminating the right

16

to present this category of evidence, the mental health

17

evidence that would show, if accepted by a jury, that

18

the Respondent was guilty of second-degree murder,

19

instead of first-degree murder, what the court was doing

20

was expanding the -- the scope of premeditation and

21

deliberation; they were aggravating the offense.

22

is a fundamental unfairness.

23

The unfairness -- and that's a very important

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

But this -- the case

24

is -- is very different from Bouie, which you -- which

25

you rely on.

In -- in Bouie, it was the question of a

rule that is governing conduct.

2

premises; they have no reason to think that they are

3

committing an offense if they don't leave when somebody

4

asks them to if they came onto the premise lawfully.

5

So what the Court said in Bouie was that

6

this is a regulation of primary conduct, and, at the

7

time these people acted, they had no reason to believe

8

that what they did was unlawful.

9

different --

10

MR. MOGILL:

People come on to

That's quite a

Yeah, I agree with that,

11

Justice Ginsburg, except that, at footnote 5 in Bouie,

12

this Court explicitly rejected the notion that

13

subjective reliance by the accused is -- is even an

14

aspect of the test for determining --

15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It -- it isn't subjective

reliance; it's -- it's what was the law.

17

MR. MOGILL:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -And the Court said that

19

the State supreme court interpretation of the statute

20

was quite a surprise.

21

MR. MOGILL:

Yes.

And what the Court did in

22

both Bouie and in Rogers was look at the underlying

23

State law.

24

South Carolina law regarding trespass and found that,

25

until a year and a half later, it hadn't been construed

In Bouie, the Court looked at the history of

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to apply to a failure to leave, as opposed to an entry.

2

In Rogers, the Court surveyed the very -- a

3

very sparse Tennessee authority on the year-and-a-day

4

rule.

5

conclusion that all of the law in Michigan -- and,

6

again, there are minimal holdings, for the reasons

7

Justice Sotomayor indicated -- the -- the minimal

8

holdings, but all the mentions and the holding go in the

9

direction of this existed.

That same analysis here will -- must lead to a

10

It was relied on, it wasn't contested --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

I -- I don't see how the

12

question can be whether there was a change in Michigan

13

law because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme

14

Court about what Michigan law was.

15

whatever the State supreme court says it was.

16

agree, we might disagree.

17

from the proposition that the law didn't change because

18

that's what the Michigan Supreme Court said.

Michigan law is
We might

So I think we have to start

19

So there must be some other ex post facto

20

principle that applies when there's a certain type of

21

unfairness.

22

that principle is.

23

And I wonder if you could articulate what

MR. MOGILL:

I would be happy to,

24

Justice Alito, but, first, I want to address your point

25

about having to rely on Michigan Supreme Court's
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determination of Michigan law because this Court has

2

made it very clear that you can't let a State court

3

relabel something in a way that avoids Federal

4

constitutional review.

5

Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke to that point

6

in Collins v. Youngblood.

7

that in your dissent in Clark.

8

dissent in Rogers, you spoke to the point, I think, in

9

an apt phrasing, that this Court will rely on a State

Justice Kennedy, you spoke to
Justice Scalia, in your

10

court's reasonable determination of State law.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. MOGILL:

I'm sorry?

I --

So two -- two

No.

The

14

majority -- the opinion of the Court in Collins, but

15

it's also a well-established principle -- and I also

16

wanted to note that the two other mentions, but it's not

17

a principle that's been in dispute.

18

The -- the Court's analysis in both Bouie

19

and Rogers also supports what I'm saying because the

20

Court independently looked at South Carolina law in

21

Bouie.

22

in Rogers and --

23

The Court independently looked at Tennessee law

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think you're -- what

24

you're arguing is that, under certain -- in evaluating

25

certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what State law is, is not dispositive.

2

you're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell

3

a State court what State law is.

4

MR. MOGILL:

I don't think

This Court certainly does not

5

have a right to tell the Michigan Supreme Court, going

6

forward, what State law is with respect to diminished

7

capacity.

But -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I mean, suppose this

Can -- can a Federal court

10

say -- you know, we -- we think that the -- the

decisions of the intermediate State supreme court were

correct and this new decision by the State supreme court

16

No, but this is not -- that's

23

Here you're applying a constitutional

MR. MOGILL:

We're trying -- we're applying

a constitutional principle -JUSTICE ALITO:

So what is that -- that gets

me to the second part of my question.

24

MR. MOGILL:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, exactly.
What is the -- the

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

constitutional principle that doesn't depend on what

2

State law was?

3

MR. MOGILL:

The constitutional principle is

4

that Respondent had a right to present a defense that

5

existed at the time of his offense, unless it was

6

clearly unforeseeable -- excuse me -- unless it was

7

unforeseeable and -- and indefensible by reference to

8

law that had been expressed prior to the time of the

9

conduct, that that law might change, which we don't have

10

here.

11

And, Justice Breyer, I think that the

12

phrasing also goes to respond to your question.

13

The -- the formulation in -- in Rogers that confines

14

looking to the law as of the time that the conduct

15

occurred, and -- and, even if you go forward, there was

16

nothing to suggest an alternate interpretation of the

17

statute, a questioning opinion, nothing that would

18

suggest that the law in Michigan was about to change.

19

We also have the fact that, unlike the

20

year-and-a-day rule, diminished capacity as -- as a

21

doctrine is well-supported and increasingly supported by

22

medical and mental health evidence.

23

exact opposite of the year-and-a-day rule in that

24

regard.

25

It's the -- the

It also furthers -JUSTICE ALITO:

This is -- this is the due

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

process issue, right?

2

MR. MOGILL:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's -- that's exactly it -So why is it unfair?

Why is

4

there an entitlement under due process to assert what

5

appears under the law of the State's intermediate court

6

decisions to be a valid defense, but is later determined

7

never to have been or not to have been, at that time, a

8

valid defense?

9

What is the unfairness involved there?

MR. MOGILL:

The unfairness is because it

10

was sufficiently well-established -- it was thoroughly

11

well-established as a matter of Michigan law, so

12

Respondent and everybody else in Michigan had a right to

13

rely on it.

14

In fact, if this Court were to reverse the

15

Sixth Circuit, Respondent would be the only person in

16

Michigan charged with a crime prior to Carpenter who

17

would not be allowed to present a diminished capacity

18

defense at a fair trial.

19

violation was.

20

That's how extreme the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess the alternative is

21

you are going to allow the bar associations, helpful as

22

they are, by writing instructions to determine issues

23

that courts themselves have never determined -- or at

24

least not authoritative supreme courts.

25

worrying matter, where you are trying to create coherent

And that's a

systems of law.

MR. MOGILL:

If I can briefly -- quickly

3

respond, Justice Breyer, the -- I disagree that

4

we're -- that I'm in any way suggesting that turning

5

anything over to the Bar Association.

6

of that instruction is I think strong evidence of the

7

reasonableness of reliance of the bench and bar in

anybody.

I -- I think we actually have a lot of areas

of agreement after 45 minutes of oral argument.
Number one, Justice Breyer, is that there

20

really is only one case in Michigan that reaches the

21

holding that Mr. Carpenter would like that you can

22

assert this defense, and that was the Lynch case in

23

1973, which preceded the 1975 statute.

24
25

And so, under well-established Michigan law,
again -- you know, In re Lamphere, Reese, which was

their 2012 decision reapplying In re Lamphere, that code

2

occupies the field, and at that point, the common law

3

decision no longer existed.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think he contested that.

5

I think he never went further into it, but he seemed to

6

disagree with the proposition that, where there is a

7

Michigan statute, it can't be supplemented by the common

8

law.

9

MR. BURSCH:

I did not hear him say that.

10

And, if you go back and you read Reese and In re

11

Lamphere, I don't know how anyone could possibly

12

disagree with that.

13
14

There are certainly areas --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
interrupt you.

MR. BURSCH:

my premise when I presented that to him.

disagrees with it.

21

MR. BURSCH:

Well, then I disagree

with that.

23

it's well-settled in Michigan that when the Michigan

legislature speaks to a particular subject matter in

25

criminal law that the code controls and the common law

If you look at In re Lamphere and Reese,

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

cannot supplement it.

2

The words of the Michigan Supreme Court in

3

Reese itself were, "The courts have no power to add an

4

affirmative defense that the legislature did not

5

create."

6
7

And -- and I really don't think there can be
a dispute about that.

13

Are -- are there any other people who

MR. BURSCH:

I'm -- I'm not aware of any,

14

Justice Ginsburg, and -- and the reason for that -- that

15

quirk is because his habeas process, by coincidence,

16

happened to take such a long time.

17

that we're up here on a case where the murder actually

18

took place 20 years ago and the trial is shortly after

19

that.

20

It's pretty rare

But -- but quirks in how long litigation

21

happens don't determine whether people get the benefit

22

of changes in law or not.

23

that this Court applied in Rogers and Bouie, was the

change -- if there was a change -- indefensible and not

expected.

What matters is the standard

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Was there anyone prior to

2

2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was

3

precluded from doing so because a court thought, oh --

4

you know, the -- the statute really clears the field,

5

and -- and this defense is not available?

6

Was it -- can you point to anything?

7

MR. BURSCH:

We can't point to anything,

8

just like they can't point to anything.

9

you know, in 1975 --

10
11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You've got a --

Well, I guess they can point

to just a lot of people who were raising this defense.
MR. BURSCH:

Right.

And they can point to

13

cases that assume, without deciding, that the defense

14

might exist.

15

Michigan Supreme Court became the first Michigan court

16

to look at it -- and I forget now who mentioned this, I

17

think it was Justice Kennedy -- that the Michigan

18

Supreme Court did what this Court often does, it waited

19

for the right case to present itself.

20

And then it wasn't until 2001, when the

MR. BURSCH:

Well -- you know, it could be

because the Michigan Supreme Court thought -- you know,

4

there's enough confusion, because of the mentions in the

5

lower court, that it's time that -- that we address

6

this.

7

I don't know why the Michigan Supreme Court

8

took it up in Carpenter.

9

fair-minded jurists, which is the habeas standard, could

What I do know is that

10

agree that Carpenter was neither indefensible nor

11

unexpected.

12

business, but I would note that the Michigan Court of

13

Appeals here was unanimous.

14

And -- you know, it's not a head-counting

Previously, the Michigan Court of Appeals in

15

Talton, decided the year after Carpenter, reached the

16

exact same conclusion with respect to the due process

17

question.

18

looking at this.

19

So we've got six Michigan appellate judges

You know, going back to -- to what the

20

Michigan law said, I -- I also heard my friend mention

21

the Griffin case, this is the three-paragraph order

22

where they -- they remand for ineffective assistance.

23

Well, Griffin is one of the cases that the Michigan

24

Supreme Court discusses in Carpenter.

25

And, in the very next sentence, the supreme
52
Alderson Reporting Company

1

court says, "However, we have never specifically

2

authorized the defense's use in Michigan courts."

3

know, it just wasn't there.

mentions, and, then, as Justice Breyer mentioned, he's

5

got jury instructions, which are promulgated by the

6

State bar, not the State supreme court -- or by any

7

court, for that matter.

You

What you have are these

And what you have to ask yourself, is it
objectively unreasonable, is it beyond any possibility

12

indefensible and unexpected.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -Do you have any idea -- a

rough estimate, how many cases there were between, say,

21

MR. BURSCH:

22

To be perfectly clear, what In re Lamphere

Oh, no, no, no.

23

and Reese and everything else say is that, when the

24

legislature has spoken to a particular area, then the

25

courts cannot supplement.

They had never spoken about

1

mental capacity defenses prior to 1975, and so the slate

2

was free for the courts to do what they wanted.

3

So there's nothing wrong with Lynch in '73.

4

The problem is continuing to assume that there was a

5

defense that wasn't in the '75 statute.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you were

7

representing a defendant in this position, you certainly

8

would have raised the diminished capacity defense prior

9

to Carpenter, wouldn't you?

10

MR. BURSCH:

Undoubtedly.

But I don't think

11

it means that fair-minded jurists could not possibly

12

conclude that Carpenter was both indefensible and not

13

expected.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, if you were a

15

prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense,

16

would you have?

17

MR. BURSCH:

Well, I don't know.

If I was a

18

prosecutor, I would have looked at the plain language of

19

the statute --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. BURSCH: -- and I probably would have.

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- have any reason to think

about here --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume you'd need a case

4

in which the prosecutor was pretty -- pretty clear that

5

a diminished capacity defense would prevail.

6

it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel,

7

right?

8

MR. BURSCH:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Otherwise,

That's exactly right, Justice.
But what's in the 37 cases

10

then?

12

They must have wanted to -- to raise the defense, and

13

somebody said no.

I -- they got up there.

MR. BURSCH:

I assume the defendant

They must have brought them.

No, I don't believe that there

15

was a single case in those 37 where someone tried to

16

raise the defense and the court said no, nor was there a

17

case where the prosecutor said, you can't raise the

defense, and the court said yes.

2

and it says no.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just to go back to

4

Justice Breyer's question -- I mean, there may be no way

5

you can answer this, but are we talking about -- you

6

know, do five people a year -- did five people a year

7

raise this or -- or 20 or 100?

8

numbers?

I mean, what kind of

MR. BURSCH:

appellate decisions referencing it.

You know, all we've got are the

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MR. BURSCH:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

Right.

So if we've got 37 cases -You can't really tell

because nobody was objecting to anything --

15

MR. BURSCH:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. BURSCH:

Correct.
-- right?

So you've got 37 cases over a

18

course of 18 years, '75 to -- to '93.

19

tells us maybe two cases a year in a system that

20

processes thousands of criminal cases.

21

Now, that -- that

You know, there was nothing here that would

22

make the Supreme Court's application of the plain

23

language so indefensible, so unexpected, that no

24

reasonable jurist could possibly have reached the same

25

conclusion as now two unanimous Michigan Court of

Appeals panels have.
I wanted to touch, briefly, on the

3

unfairness point.

4

brought up Bouie, and Bouie is really the perfect

5

analogy because, again, under the AEDPA standard, it's

6

Lancaster's burden to show that the court of appeals

7

decision here was contrary to our misapplication.

8

to the contrary, it was the exact application of Bouie.

And Justice Ginsburg, I -- I believe

And,

9

In Bouie, you had a clear statute that was

10

very narrow, and the State court expanded it in a very

11

unexpected way.

12

indefensible and unexpected.

13

And this Court found that was

The exact opposite happened here.

You had

14

the Michigan Supreme Court applying very narrow

15

statutory language exactly the way it was written, in

16

accord with 200 years of interpretive principles.

17

So -- so, really, the problem here is not

18

any unfairness.

19

again, not applying habeas deference under the statute

20

or this Court's precedent and disregarding another

21

Michigan State court decision where reasonable jurists

22

could have reached different conclusions on this.

23

The problem is the Sixth Circuit, yet

It's not our burden to -- to demonstrate

24

what the law was or wasn't.

25

a reasonable jurist could have reached the conclusion

All we have to show is that
