ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Stolt-Nielsen, this Court held first that

12

a party may not be compelled to submit to arbitration

13

unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that

14

the party agreed to do so.

15

class arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to

16

such a degree that it cannot be presumed that parties

17

consented to class arbitration simply by agreeing to

18

submit their disputes to an arbitrator.

19

describes this case.

20

And second, that because

That precisely

The agreement commits the parties to submit

21

their disputes to arbitration and says nothing about

22

class arbitration.

23

suggesting that the parties ever considered such a

24

prospect, and there is no background principle of State

25

law that favors it.

There is no extrinsic evidence

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- about the parties

2

never considering it, when this case was in the New

3

Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red

4

brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then,

5

that "the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether

6

the parties contemplated class arbitration in their

7

agreements."

A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does

8

not contest.

Does it -- that seems to be a recognition

9

by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was

10

contemplated.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, two

12

things.

13

14, footnote 7 of our yellow brief, you'll see all of

14

the references made in the advocacy before the State

15

court judge by my -- my brother here, not recognizing

16

repeatedly that what Oxford was asking for was a

17

dismissal and a transfer to individual arbitration --

18

bilateral arbitration.

19
20

First of all, if you look at page 10 -- or page

There was no mistake, whatsoever, in the New
Jersey State courts that Oxford's position was that --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Waxman --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. WAXMAN:

Finish your answer.

Yes -- that bilateral

24

arbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was

25

similarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Oxford took the position based on an understanding of

2

New Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't

3

decided class action question, that the decision would

4

be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as

5

it was in Stolt-Nielsen.

6

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I apologize.

That's my question.

8

you never -- you never argued that it was beyond the

9

power of the arbitrator to decide this question, did

10

Did

you?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

In the first instance, no.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And do you take the

13

position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's

14

question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted,

15

or was just -- was there just a mistake here?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think there was a

17

mistake here.

18

in light of the state of the law in 2002.

19

I think it was -- it was understandable,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we --

So why should we rewrite

20

our standard of review to accommodate your client's

21

error?

22

do.

Because that's really what you're asking us to

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

I'm -More than once we have

said an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are

3

not asking the Court to vary in any material respect the

4

highly deferential standard that's reflected in Section

5

10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act.

6

But we are asking that that generally

7

applicable standard of review be applied to a question

8

with a very strong empirical presumption that the FAA

9

has attached to it and this Court has announced, which

10

is, that absent an actual agreement by the contracting

11

parties that they will permit their disputes to be

12

arbitrated on a class basis, an inference that may not,

13

as a matter of Federal law, be derived from an agreement

14

to submit all disputes to arbitration --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So your rule is that

16

although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation

17

of the contract, in this case, there is an exception

18

because?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, in this case, you defer,

20

as you always do, but you -- you have to provide --

21

there is some level of review.

22

the arbitrator says I've looked at the contract and I

23

think this.

It's not just because

24

As this Court has said over and over again,

25

including in Stolt, just saying something is so doesn't
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make it so.

There is deferential review, but there is

2

review.

3

Court has now said twice strongly presumes that there

4

is -- there is no agreement to arbitrate as a class

5

unless it is clearly shown to be so and that that

6

showing is not satisfied by an all-disputes clause.

And the review is of a proposition that this

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so we make that rule

8

just with reference to the word "arbitration" when it's

9

in the class action context, or does this apply to other

10

words as well?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

Well, I think -I'm -- I'm just not sure

what the --

14

MR. WAXMAN:

So I -- I think -- I mean, this

15

Court has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the

16

question of class versus bilateral arbitration is a

17

special kind of question under the FAA as to which the

18

Federal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of

19

decision.

20

And therefore, the question I suppose is,

21

when a court looks at a -- an assertion by an arbitrator

22

that the language of the contract permits -- and in this

23

case, the arbitrator found that it required class

24

arbitration, a court has to ascertain whether that

25

assertion of fact is at least plausible, or, to use the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

vernacular of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, the Court

2

said in Stolt-Nielsen that the stipulation left no room

3

for an argument that the parties had agreed.

4

And similarly here, the --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was no -- in

6

Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract

7

said nothing on the issue of class proceeding.

8

case, we have no such stipulation --

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

In this

Correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- and the arbitrator is

11

interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule

12

is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's

13

interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right,

14

unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --

16

everyone agrees in this case, as one would have to,

17

based on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the --

18

this arbitration clause in this case just said all

19

disputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the

20

arbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed

21

if it -- if he found that that indicated an actual

22

agreement of the parties to class arbitration.

23

inconsistent with the actual holding in Stolt-Nielsen.

24
25

That is

And in this case, that sentence is
indistinguishable from that orthodox clause.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're -- you're saying

3

that this is off the wall.

4

in -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

That's your -- to put it

Well, not to be pejorative, but

6

I would say this, in the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen,

7

this language, quote, "leaves no room" for a conclusion

8

that the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're saying -- you're

10

saying that the -- that the deference which we give to

11

arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we

12

give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a

13

limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact

14

becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact,

15

right?

16
17
18

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

And in this case, a

question of Federal arbitration.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have other examples

19

from other -- other review that we've given to

20

arbitrators' factual decisions?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Well --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I -- I don't want

23

to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but

24

if -- if you're telling me this is just a general

25

principle, that at some point if it's too much off the
9

1

wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can

2

reverse it.

3

have?

4

What -- what other examples do -- do we

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, let me -- let me -- let

5

me refer you to Stolt-Nielsen first, and then to a

6

hypothetical example that my brother gives.

Stolt-Nielsen said --

But that is a class action

Okay.

I -- I --

11
12

No, I want a case.

MR. WAXMAN:

I want a --

Oh, you mean a non-class action

case.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I want a case where we

16

have, or where Federal courts have with our approval,

17

disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator

18

because the factual finding was too much off the wall.

19

That there was simply not enough basis to support it.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, I can't -- I'm

21

sort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration

22

decisions.

23

holding of this -- well, no, I guess -- I guess First

24

Options is an example in which the arbitrator found that

25

the parties had agreed to let the arbitrator decide the

I can't -- there may be.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

I can't think of a

Official

1

arbitrability question.

2

was wrong as a matter of fact.

3

And this Court held that that

The Court reviewed the -- the facts of the

4

case and said there is no way that the Kaplans agreed to

5

have the arbitrability question submitted.

6

And if I may -- I realize this isn't an

7

actual case -- but my brother gives the example of a

8

form of deferential review, which would allow a court to

9

examine and reverse an arbitrator's decision in a

10

context in which the arbitration agreement says, this is

11

going to be arbitrated under California law, and the

12

arbitrator says, well, I'm going to apply New York law

13

in this case because -- I don't know, the parties have

14

all moved to New York and they like New York and they

15

litigate in New York.

16

My brother says that is reviewable and

17

reversible.

18

have here a clause that this Court has said cannot

19

suffice to establish actual agreement to arbitrate as a

20

class.

21
22

And that's exactly what we have here.

We

And the arbitrator has said nonetheless, I
have read it that way.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but it's not

24

exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for

25

arbitration.

It is not the standard boilerplate so you
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could say when he interprets it, he's really making a

2

decision about arbitrability.

3

mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with

4

it -- but you understand the reasoning.

5

civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to

6

arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil

7

action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore,

8

it's there.

9

And you can follow -- I

It says, no

Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but

10

it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of

11

the language rather than a general rule.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

The fact -- the fact that the

13

arbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses.

14

says, you cannot bring a civil action in court about any

15

dispute under this agreement, you must settle your

16

disputes in arbitration, is completely orthodox.

17

And as we point out at page 24, note 3 of

18

our blue brief, it's quite arguably required by New

19

Jersey law and laws of other States that say to be

20

perfectly -- it is -- you have to be perfectly clear

21

when you are telling a contract -- a contracting

22

counterparty that disputes will be arbitrated.

23

to tell them that that means that they cannot bring

24

their disputes in court.

25

One

You have

And a rule -- a reading of this -- I mean,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I -- I submit to you that, consistent with grammar and

2

ordinary meaning of words, it cannot be plausibly read

3

to say that you can't bring a civil action about any

4

dispute in court means that you can -- you are agreeing

5

to arbitrate your dispute on a class basis, for a whole

6

variety of reasons.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, could I just ask

8

you what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4)

9

because my understanding of the standard was that a

10

court had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his

11

powers, was acting outside the scope of his authority --

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that we have said quite

14

a number of times that the fact that the arbitrator

15

committed an error and even a serious error is not

16

enough, that he had to be doing something that was

17

simply outside the scope of his authority.

18

with that or disagree with that?

19

with that, what's your standard for what we should be

20

thinking about in -- under 10(a)(4).

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Do you agree

And if you disagree

I agree with that as a

22

proposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is

23

whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority.

24

case, in the context of the question about actual

25

agreement to arbitrate on a class -- as a class, this
13
Alderson Reporting Company

In this

Official

1

Court has interpreted Federal law to require evidence of

2

a contractual basis of actual agreement between the

3

parties and has precluded, as a matter of Federal law,

4

an arbitrator from inferring such agreement from an

5

all-disputes clause.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you don't disagree, do

7

you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion,

8

you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's

9

doing is trying to construe a contract.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

I think is not a defense.

12

addition --

13

I think that -- I mean, trying
What I would say, in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but he is going -- but

14

he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure

15

out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit

16

statement about what the parties agreed on.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Right, but he did not take

18

cognizance of the holding of this Court in

19

Stolt-Nielsen, reiterated in Concepcion, that you may

20

not infer intent from an agreement to submit to

21

arbitration.

22

the presumption in the Federal -- under the Federal

23

Arbitration Act that this Court's holdings in those two

24

cases reflects.

25

And more fundamentally, he did not heed

That is, there -- this Court said in
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Concepcion that it would be hard to imagine that -- hard

2

to believe that defendants would ever bet the company

3

with no effective means of review.

4

There is therefore a presumption in the law

5

that, absent a very clear statement of a meeting of the

6

parties' minds there is no consent.

7

opposite presumption.

8
9

But he indulged the

His presumption was --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So now you're saying that he

exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of

10

clear statement presumption.

11

we've ever suggested that there is such a clear

12

statement presumption.

13

if the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed

14

on anything, then we're not going to accept class

15

arbitration.

16

But I don't think that

In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that

But we've not said that in the process of

17

construing an agreement there is a clear statement rule.

18

Now, maybe we should have said that, but -- you know,

19

it's -- it's no place in our case law now.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Kagan --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Am I wrong?

We are not -- you didn't say

23

the words "clear statement."

You -- what you said in

24

Stolt-Nielsen -- what you held in Stolt-Nielsen was not

25

simply that parties who have stipulated can't be forced
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

into class arbitration.

2

cannot have class arbitration in the absence of

3

affirmative agreement that is not evidenced by an

4

all-disputes clause.

5

strong presumption must, as a matter of Federal law,

6

inform the arbitrator's decision.

7

What you held was that you

And the -- that background -- that

And in this case, not only didn't it because

8

you said, look, an all-disputes clause doesn't suffice.

9

And he said, well, there's the word "civil action" in

10

here and I think that that not only suffices, but that

11

indicates an actual agreement to require class

12

arbitration.

13

That doesn't pass any test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't --

It was a combination of

14

the two provisions.

15

excluded by the first provision is included in the

16

second.

17

not be so.

18

describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an

19

unusual wording.

20

the first clause and then arbitration in the second.

21

said that he had never seen this particular language.

22

Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is

23

unusual?

24
25

He said that everything that is

And he also said something, which may or may
He said that this particular way of

Arbitration clauses that say,

in one form of words or another, that you may not bring
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to

2

arbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace.

3

a -- there was a clause in the Steelworkers' trilogy.

4

mean, they -- there's a lot of citation to Enterprise

5

Wheel in this case.

6

There was
I

The -- the provision in -- in the

7

Steelworkers agreement, and virtually all labor

8

agreements, make this explicit.

9

every single article and preposition in the clause here,

10

It's not precisely

but it is functionally indistinct.

The same was true --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

well, was this an experienced arbitrator?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Was this -- was this a --

I -- so far as the record

14

shows, yes.

But my -- whether he was right or wrong

15

about this, I submit to you two things:

16

there is no way -- three things:

Number one,

17

Number one, there is no way consistent with

18

the rules of grammar that one can read this sentence as

19

sending class actions to arbitration -- requiring class

20

arbitration.

21

Number two, there is no heed by the

22

arbitrator -- Number two is that -- that for all intents

23

and purposes this clause is the clause that is orthodox,

24

that was at issue in Stolt-Nielsen.

25

the one the Fifth Circuit decided and the Second Circuit
17
Alderson Reporting Company

It's the same as

Official

1

decided in the cases -- the other cases that created the

2

split here.

3

that was at issue in the Steelworkers v. Enterprise

4

Wheel.

It's the same as the standard labor clause

And -- and this is my other point -- it is

5
6

plain from the arbitrator's decisions, both in his 2003

7

decision and in his post-Stolt-Nielsen 2010 decision, that

8

he not only was not applying the Federal law presumption

9

that this Court identified in Stolt and Concepcion, but

10

he was applying the opposite presumption.
He said in 2003 that because -- if this --

11
12

if this clause wouldn't be construed to permit or

13

require class arbitration, it would mean that the

14

parties had agreed not to resolve their disputes in any

15

forum using a class manner, and that would be, quote,

16

"so bizarre, it would require an express provision."
In 2010, he said, well, I overshot the mark

17
18

here.

But the point is still the same.

19

page 41a -- 40a and 41a of the petition appendix.

20

said, the -- the point is that if he is not allowed to

21

bring a class proceeding in arbitration when he at least

22

presumptively was in State court, that would be so

23

strange that, "If the clause," and I'm quoting from the

24

second full paragraph on 41a, "If the clause cannot

25

permit Dr. Sutter's court class action to go to

18
Alderson Reporting Company

And this is on
He

Official

1

arbitration, then Dr. Sutter's original class action

2

must be outside of the arbitration agreement

3

altogether."

4
5

In other words, he was indulging a
presumption that it is so unnatural --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- that comes under

7

our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was

8

between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties

9

here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether

10

or not this language, that says nothing about it, did

11

encompass class or not.

12

In Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted

13

arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about

14

it.

15

could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some

16

policy thing.

17

The -- the point is that what this

Court's -- the fact that there was a stipulation that

apply the principle that you -- that -- that actual

asked -- I don't -- I would apply -- I think you could

4

simply apply the standard that you applied in

5

Stolt-Nielsen, which is the "leave no room" standard,

6

which is pretty darn deferential, and you would have to

find that this sentence, in light of Federal law as

8

contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?

MR. KATZ:

Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, we -- we were

11

concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company

6

before it was codified --

what the contract says, and the court has to accept

12

that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.

MR. KATZ:

This Court's jurisprudence for

almost 2 centuries has held just exactly that.

is no loophole no matter how tiny?

It says what he says

There is language in the cases to that effect.

MR. KATZ:

That's news to me.

12

disregard is not a standard by which this matter has

Hall Street and other cases that 10(a)(4) is the

15

exclusive ground set forth by Congress, that this Court

16

And the judge specifically relied upon that,

That is correct.

there is no dispute about that because you are right,

20

there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to

decide this issue.

And -- but here

He did,

Justice Breyer raised the second question.

Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the

Court to overturn his decision?

said, if the standard is manifest disregard of fact and

Because your adversary is saying, the law is

agree to class action -- arbitration, and he says there

means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't.

If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then

everybody's bound.

10

Now,

ultimately, when the matter was certified --

8

That -- that is correct.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wait a minute.

Where did he

get the authority to make that decision to interpret the
contract with respect to them?

11

MR. KATZ:

Well, the --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

You're saying he can do it

13

with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the

14

arbitrator decide whether this calls for class

15

arbitration.

16

didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it

17

calls for class arbitration.

18

And in the

But Stolt-Nielsen, which the

arbitrator faithfully reviewed, analyzed, and followed,

makes clear that you can have class arbitration as long

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did these other people

this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say

that -- that we agreed to class action.

to class -- I don't want this arbitrator.

17

I mean, they might have said,

We didn't agree

They didn't agree to this arbitrator.
should they be bound by -- by whatever he says?

18

MR. KATZ:

Well, for one thing,

19

Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Oxford wanted.

20

Oxford argued that the class action should go into

21

arbitration.

Why

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could they -- could they

opt out?
MR. KATZ:

Well, ultimately, they could --

And I want

to -- I'd like to be clear on a point, if I may.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How can they opt out if

they've agreed to class arbitration?

4

MR. KATZ:

Well, they can opt out of the

5

class and pursue, if they wanted to at that point, an

6

individual arbitration if that's what they chose to do.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you sure?

It seems to

8

me if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've

9

agreed to class arbitration.

10

MR. KATZ:

Well, they -- they proceeded --

11

they agreed for the matter to proceed as a class

12

proceeding.

13

are rules that governed that, right?

as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we

21

have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case.

23

are in the class.

24
25

MR. KATZ:

I

Justice Kennedy, the

determination that this matter could proceed as a class
39
Alderson Reporting Company

1

arbitration was only the first issue that was decided.

2

We then engaged in the procedural mechanism by which the

3

matter could be certified and that they could --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, presumably they could

5

opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless

6

they opted out?

7

bound by litigations.

8

MR. KATZ:

9
10
11

That's not the usual way people are

But everyone, Justice Alito,

everyone signs the same agreement.

And therefore, if

the arbitrator's going to make a determination here -JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but I think you're --

12

you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that

13

this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract.

14

That's the assumption.

15

reviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the

16

interpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we

17

would say, this is wrong.

18

Assume that to be the case.

19

This is incorrect.

If we were

This is really wrong.

Okay?

Then how are they -- how are these absent

20

people bound?

21

well, they can opt out.

22

bound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't

23

agree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an

24

unusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.

25

And it's really not an answer to say,
If they didn't agree to be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You would never have

1

class action arbitration if that were so.

2

MR. KATZ:

If -- if it was --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It would be impossible

4

because you could never get in advance -- they find out

5

that by getting notice and then they decide whether they

6

want to stay with it or opt out.

7

MR. KATZ:

Well, in any class arbitration,

8

the arbitrator is not going to decide the same questions

9

as to the 20,000 of the same agreements.

It's decided

10

based upon the class representative who brings the

11

matter.

12

And even if the arbitrator was wrong,

13

Justice Alito, I submit that under 10(a)(4) in the

14

applicable standard, that even in Concepcion, this Court

15

said 10(a)(4) is -- is not an issue of mistake, it's an

16

issue of misconduct.

17

If there was a mistake, that still would not be enough

18

with respect to the courts to have vacated the

19

arbitrator's determination on this matter.

20

And that's not what we have here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And this may not --

21

I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be.

I

22

thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these

23

things quickly.

This has been going on 11 years, right?

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. KATZ:

This has been going on 11 years.
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That is true.

2

It's been going on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not -- it's not

3

a facetious question because I think one of the concerns

4

about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the

5

supposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have

6

sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when

7

it's going to bind 20,000 people.

8

MR. KATZ:

9

Well, class arbitration is, as in

many arbitrations in this day and age, involves complex

10

issues, that sometimes you have major corporations doing

11

battle over -- over major agreements that they know at

12

the time involved big ticket items.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me ask -- ask

14

you this question because I think it's consistent with

15

the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little

16

bit different, though.

17

a hypothetical case, this is not this case because I

18

don't know the facts.

19

small town, well respected, doesn't have a great big

20

practice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator.

class action, and then I will leave it for some other

Does he have that obligation?

MR. KATZ:

And if he

Justice Kennedy, that should not

bear on the decision here because this matter comes up

10

under 10(a)(4).

If there were questions about the

11

partiality of the arbitrator, then I want to rule in

12

favor of Katz because I want to prolong this thing as

13

long as possible, then perhaps Oxford should have

14

brought the matter under 10(a)(2) and --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How long -- can we

16

straighten out this 11 years?

17

in the New Jersey courts before there was ever an

18

arbitrator appointed?

19

MR. KATZ:

How many years was this

Well, the matter wasn't in the

20

New Jersey courts for that long, but various points in

21

time because the AAA rules allow for a -- a filing of

22

a Federal suit to vacate Oxford, on multiple

23

occasions --

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but tell me why --

why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision?

That should not be a factor in our decision?

2
3

MR. KATZ:

Partiality is not a factor,

Justice Kennedy --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. KATZ:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

-- in this decision.
I'm sorry.

Finish

your answer.

8
9

Well, but surely --

MR. KATZ:

In this decision, because

partiality or what could potentially be perceived as a

10

subjective intent, so the arbitrator does not play under

11

10(a)(4).

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But under --

13

under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is

14

addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another

15

party.

16

I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to

17

an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a

18

decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to

19

partiality between parties, but a problem about the way

20

the system would work, that would create an incentive

21

for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a

22

ruling that expands his authority.

23

MR. KATZ:

Well, arbitrators -- I would

24

submit that an arbitrator who was doing something that

25

was -- that was documented or perceived to be crazy -­
44

and pardon my vernacular -- or just way out of line,

2

then I'd submit that arbitrator is not going to be hired

3

again.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How many -- how -- what

5

is the history of class actions and arbitrations?

6

are at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of

7

rules about how you handle class arbitrations, right?

8

MR. KATZ:

I think it's

important -- if I could just address a couple of points
regarding that.

11
12

That's correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?

Well, I don't know --

1

But -- if I may point this out, class

2

arbitrations were certainly in existence at the time

3

that this matter was sent into class arbitration.

4

in fact, I think it's also worthy to understand that

5

when I brought this matter in superior court, I argued

6

that the class action should be kept in court, but it

7

was Oxford's argument that everything including the

8

class action go into arbitration.

9

And

It was Oxford's interpretation of its own

10

clause that the arbitrator relied upon, which puts this

11

case completely outside of Stolt-Nielsen, where in

12

Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator fashioned his -- their own

13

rules based on some policy preference about arbitrations

14

-- about class actions which wasn't present here.

15

And if I could address an issue that was

16

raised about -- that the arbitrator discussed something

17

was bizarre.

was prior to Stolt-Nielsen -- the arbitrator expressly

19

disavowed that in his 2010 opinion.

21

of the agreement as well as the representations made as

to what that agreement meant to the court system.

But here, both sides, Mr. Chief

Justice, expressly asked the arbitrator.

This is not a

7

question of arbitrability because both sides wanted the

8

arbitrator to make that decision.

9

when it came to light that Bazzle -- there was a

Then even after 2010,

10

plurality and the issue of whether it's a question of

11

arbitrability is an open question, Oxford didn't go

12

running to court then.

13

Instead, it went back to the arbitrator and

14

said, we want you to reconsider your 2003 decision.

15

the arbitrator again went through the analysis of

16

interpreting the agreement and the representations made

17

by the parties about what that agreement meant.

18

And

I submit we have to -- if we trust

19

arbitrators to handle such important issues as civil

rights issues and other very important matters of

singular importance, we have to expect that they will

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

I have three points, two small ones and one

7

significant one.

8
9

Thank you.

The first small one is that this notion,
this canard, that we told the district -- the State

10

court judge that class actions should be sent to

11

arbitration is dispensed with on pages 13 and 14 of our

12

reply brief, following the sentence, "Tellingly, Sutter

13

resorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous

14

positions."

15

And I refer the Court again specifically to

16

footnote 7 on page 14, where we quote my brother's

17

statements to the State court judge explaining that what

18

we were asking for was, quote, "a motion to compel

19

individual arbitration."

20

The second small point goes to the issue of

21

what the number is of class arbitrations.

I also don't

22

know that.

23

in Stolt-Nielsen because this was reported in the AAA

24

amicus brief, that not a single final decision had been

25

rendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in

But we know that as of this Court's decision

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any class arbitration.

2

The AAA class arbitration rules were adopted

3

after this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open

4

the possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in

5

this case said was surprising because the arbitrator

6

said quite correctly that everyone expected that in

7

Bazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as

8

class arbitration.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What is your significant

point?

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. WAXMAN:

I can't go back 200 years, but

13

let's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard.

14

the Steelworkers v. the Enterprise Wheel case, what this

15

Court held was, quote, "An award is legitimate only so

16

long as it draws its essence from the agreement.

17

the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this

18

obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse

19

enforcement of the award."

20

And in

When

And our submission is that this award, the

21

conclusion that the all-disputes provision here

22

manifested an actual agreement by the parties to class

23

arbitration, cannot possibly be reconciled with the

24

plain language or Stolt-Nielsen's holding.
