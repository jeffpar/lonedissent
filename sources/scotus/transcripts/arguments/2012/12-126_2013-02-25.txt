CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Bursch?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

We're not dealing here with the situation

11

where a prisoner is trying to gather new evidence AEDPA

12

has a tolling rule to take care of that problem.

13

We're also not dealing with anything that prevents

14

Petitioner from filing because that's the problem you

15

solved in Holland.

16

What we have here is the question of when a

17

petitioner must file his Federal habeas petition when he

18

has the evidence and there are no barriers to filing.

19

And 2244(d)(1)(D) addresses that exact question.

20

says, "within 1 year."

21

It

Now, Mr. Perkins asks for a fairly dramatic

22

expansion of Holland.

What he wants is equitable

23

abrogation with no diligence, no fault, or any other

24

factor.

25

simply apply the plain language of 2244(d)(1)(D).

And our primary position is that you should

3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Bursch, I thought

2

that -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you

3

could take into account -- I'm looking for the

4

brief -- you could take into account delay as a factor

5

in whether his actual innocence gateway plea should be

6

heard.

7

MR. BURSCH:

Well, he -- he does say that,

8

and we read that as a concession that, sometimes, if you

9

wait too long, that can actually trump a claim of actual

10

innocence.

11

position is that you have to act with diligence.

12

And so, at a minimum, our alternative

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not quite what

13

he's saying.

14

exception for as long as there's been a habeas statute.

15

We've applied it repeatedly.

16

We've had a miscarriage of justice

It's not that it trumps it, but that it puts

17

into doubt the evidence you're claiming, proves your

18

actual innocence.

19

as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to

20

override even an actually innocent person.

It's not the sort of situation where,

21

MR. BURSCH:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

Well, we think it -What he says is it -- it

really puts into question the validity of your claim.
MR. BURSCH:

But, Justice Sotomayor,

it -- it represents the same kind of principle, you've
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

got to act quickly, or adverse consequences can happen.

2

But what diligence does that his rule doesn't do is it

3

recognizes this compelling, countervailing State

4

interest in having notice and an opportunity to

5

investigate evidence, as soon as it's discovered.

6

Now -- and the problem here -- we don't have

7

any issue at all, if it takes 10, 15, 100 years to find

8

new evidence, but once he has that evidence, the burden

9

is on him to come forward, so that the State has the

10
11

opportunity to investigate.

And the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a small point and

12

doesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss

13

with us, but just, on the small point, he gets -- I

14

forget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that

15

Jones did it within a year.

16

MR. BURSCH:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He has one.

Yes.
Now, if I were the

18

prisoner, I'd say -- you know, this one might not work.

19

Maybe I can get two, and then he gets a second, which

20

makes a certain amount of sense to me -- although a

21

substantial period of time elapses -- and the same thing

22

happens with the third.

23

It makes sense to me that the prisoner might

24

try to wait for the third.

How -- how does that factor

25

into your diligence, assuming we get there?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

Justice Kennedy, there's

2

a very simple solution to that problem.

If he gets

3

close to the end of his year and he thinks that that

4

next affidavit might be just around the corner, but he

5

doesn't have it yet, all he has to do is file a

6

protective habeas petition with the district court, ask

7

for a stay, and say, I'm still diligently pursuing what

8

I think is going to be another affidavit.

9

can't find that next affidavit, you litigate it on the

And, if he

10

merits, and, if he does, then he amends his petition,

11

and then you hear it.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not quite -- excuse

13

me -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you

14

have a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions

15

waiting on the shelf in the district court.

16

that -- that causes its own congestion problems in the

17

district court, it seems to me.

18

MR. BURSCH:

That --

Two thoughts on that.

First,

19

we already see this in the exhaustion area.

20

petitioners who are concerned that, notwithstanding

21

statutory tolling for pursuing State remedies, that,

22

while they're monkeying around in State court, they

23

might somehow be time-barred from bringing their Federal

24

claim.

25

There are

So we see this all the time in the Sixth
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Circuit -- you know, in Michigan in particular, that

2

someone will file their petition and -- and ask for a

3

stay while they exhaust State remedies.

4

the pile really isn't going to be any different

5

than it is right now.

So -- you know,

6

But the key difference between that scenario

7

and the scenario that Perkins proposes is that, when you

8

have him file something, the State's on notice, they

9

have an opportunity to investigate.

10

Now, here, we have his last affidavit from

11

the dry cleaning clerk, and it's 10 years old.

12

if Michigan could find that person, there's no way for

13

us to meaningfully cross-examine her and investigate

14

what she really knew or didn't know when she wrote that

15

affidavit 10 years ago.

16

So, even

And so with the file and stay, you preserve

17

all of the rights, but, yet, you give the State the

18

countervailing interest that the statute was meant to

19

protect.

20

And I do want to -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would it take to --

21

what would it take to show diligence?

22

that he tried to get a lawyer, several times, and was

23

unsuccessful?

Sure.

practical question that I'd like to address.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -I have some difficulty

17

understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing.

And

18

maybe you can help me with that.

19

I understand it, said to the Petitioner, you lose for

20

two reasons.

21

actual innocence, not enough anyway; and, second -- and

22

I can understand that, because the evidence -- well,

23

that -- the most that is suggested by the affidavits is

24

that Jones was a participant in this murder, not that

25

Perkins was not responsible for the murder.

The district court, as

But, anyway, so you lose for two reasons.

2

First, you don't really have evidence of actual

3

innocence; second, you weren't diligent.

4

Circuit grants a certificate of appealability only on

5

the issue of diligence, and they say, diligence doesn't

6

make any difference.

7

The Sixth

Well, where does that leave the petitioner?

8

He's already lost on the question of whether there's

9

evidence of actual innocence, and there was no appeal on

10

that issue.

11

MR. BURSCH:

Well, we're very confused about

12

that, too.

13

is remanded to the district court to determine whether

14

he's got evidence of actual innocence.

15

pointed out, Judge Bell in the district court already

16

made that determination, so maybe they're contemplating

17

an evidentiary hearing or some further investigation,

18

but it is curious because --

19

They do say, in their opinion, that the case

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, as you just

Well, that -- that may be

20

what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the

21

issue of whether the district court adequately addressed

22

the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence,

23

unless that issue is before them.

24

supposed to be before them, unless -- isn't before them,

25

unless the certificate of appealability was issued, and
9
Alderson Reporting Company

And the issue isn't

there was no certificate of appealability on that issue.

3

MR. BURSCH:

We agree with that 100 percent,

so --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was that -- was that

5

argued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit?

6

the Sixth Circuit that, even assuming diligence, there

7

wasn't enough here, and that's what the district court

8

held?

9

MR. BURSCH:

Did you argue in

I believe that is the position

10

of the State of Michigan, that because he confessed to

11

his friends, both before and after --

12
13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it -- it was

explicitly made to the Sixth Circuit?
MR. BURSCH:

I believe that the Sixth

15

Circuit argument did focus on the question of diligence.

16

But -- you know, our opinion would be that, even if this

17

Court would use -- you know, what we call equitable

18

abrogation, to kind of wipe away the 1-year limitations

19

period, and you would also disagree on diligence, and we

20

don't think you should do that, that you would still

21

reverse because there's nothing left to be done in the

22

district court.

23

This is not a case that rises to the very,

24

very high threshold of proving actual innocence, based

25

on new evidence.

I would like to get back to the
10

Official

1

statutory language.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where does that leave

us?

4

MR. BURSCH:

I --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BURSCH:

Let's assume --

Well, that leaves you with a

7

reversal in any of those three instances.

8

you should address the circuit split, which is the

9

important question of do we apply the limitations

10

period.

11

is set up an analytical construct.

12
13

And, to turn to that, what I would like to do

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's sort of an advisory

opinion, in your judgment.

14
15

We think that

MR. BURSCH:
advisory opinion.

16

Oh, no, it wouldn't be an

It would --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure, it would be

17

because you're telling us that there is no proof of

18

actual innocence.

19

MR. BURSCH:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

I'm saying that -So why don't we just say

that?
MR. BURSCH:

I'm saying that's an

23

alternative ground to get to the same place, but the

24

Sixth Circuit's holding was, consistent with some other

25

circuits, that there is no statute of limitations here,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that you can get by with equitable abrogation, as we

2

call it.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It might be its holding,

4

but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for

5

it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive

6

merits question.

7

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

I -- I think you're

8

wholly within your right to address the merits question,

9

and I would like to turn to that.

10

The analytical construct I want to set up is

11

that we've got three different categories of prisoners

12

who claim actual innocence, based on new evidence.

13

the first category, they used that new evidence only to

14

try to establish innocence with no constitutional claim.

15

And, in Herrera, you say no Federal habeas remedy for

16

that; you have to go back to the State courts, executive

17

clemency, prosecutorial discharging of verdicts, and

18

things like that.

19

In

The second category is where you have a

20

prisoner who uses new evidence as a gateway.

21

related to the constitutional claim that they assert --

22

the true Schlup gateway.

23

case, either, and you could reserve that question,

24

although I'm happy to talk about that.

25

It's not

And that's not actually this

The case we have here is the third instance,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where the evidence of actual innocence -- the new

2

evidence, is the factual predicate for the claim.

3

you could not find a provision more on all fours with

4

that category than what Congress did in 2244(d)(1)(D).

5

And we know that Congress was thinking about actual

6

innocence in Schlup.

7

And

For those of you who are interested in the

8

context, in the legislative debate in '95 and '96,

9

before AEDPA's enactment, we have Senators Feingold and

10

Kennedy and Dodd, among others, talking about how this

11

new statute is going to eliminate claims of actual

12

innocence based on new evidence.

13

Feingold even mentioned the Schlup decision.

14

In fact, Senator

And, yet, Congress adopts 2244(d)(1)(D) and

15

all the rest of the provisions by a 91 to 8 vote.

16

Congress had this Court's decision in Schlup in the back

17

of its mind, it considered this particular construct and

18

it said, no, we want a 1-year limitations period.

19

I do want to --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Your -- your three-way

classification, you began with Herrera?

22

MR. BURSCH:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

Correct.
And -- and, in a way,

24

you're saying that you're three loops back in the

25

Herrera a bit because, here, the innocence is the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

factual predicate.

2

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

And, in the Herrera

3

case, there is no constitutional claim, so there is no

4

factual predicate.

5

innocent" claim.

6

so, that the Federal habeas remedy doesn't cover that.

It's just a stand-alone "I'm
And this Court has said, appropriately

7

You know, if you think about the remedies

8

you can get from State courts, from prosecutors, from

9

executive clemency, it's a rather big circle, and AEDPA

10

is a much smaller circle that's subsumed in that.

11

you recognize, in Herrera, that, just because you don't

12

fall within the habeas circle, doesn't mean that you

13

can't get relief.

14

And

In fact, if you look at the examples that

15

the amici briefs cite on the Respondent's side, in

16

almost every case, the final decision is motivated by

17

State action.

18

a couple of cases, there's a State attorney general's

19

office that dismisses charges in others, county

22

One, which the amicus

You know, what the -- these are the best
examples that they have for why you need an equitable
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abrogation rule, and, yet, in the vast majority of those

2

cases, it's the State system that's solving the problem.

3

Now, I do want to go back to what I think

4

is -- is the trickiest question, and that's,

5

Justice Kennedy, the second category of prisoners, those

6

who are using actual innocence to prove, not their

7

underlying constitutional claim, but, simply, the Schlup

8

gateway.

9

there, Congress has closed the door with 2244(d)(1)(D).

And I would respectfully submit that, even

10

And the best way to understand that is by

11

looking two subprovisions earlier in the second and

12

successive petitions category.

13

I'm going to make now is a little bit different than the

14

way we -- we did it in the brief, which was -- you know,

15

they had it there, they -- they don't have it here.

And this argument that

16

If you look at 2244 --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Before you present the

argument --

19

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- you are saying that

21

Congress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point

22

you're making?

23

MR. BURSCH:

The -- the contextual point

24

that I was making was that Congress knew about Schlup,

25

it was brought up in the debate that this was,
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

essentially, changing the Schlup rule and allowing

2

someone who claims actual innocence not to present their

3

claim, and Congress swept those objections aside by a 91

4

to 8 vote.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that was with

respect to successive petitions.

7

MR. BURSCH:

No, they were talking in the --

8

the legislative record, just generally, about actual

9

innocence and claims of miscarriage of justice.

10

So -- so the textual argument that I want to

11

present involving successive petitions is that, when

12

you're looking at 2244, you flow from successive

13

petitions down to the statute of limitations.
What that means is that, if you have a

14
15

successive petition, Congress requires you to prove

16

actual innocence and diligence, and you still have to

17

prove that you satisfied the statute of limitations.

18

The Seventh Circuit recognized this in the Escamilla

19

case.

20

So what that means is that, even when

21

Congress had a situation where they knew that someone

22

had presented evidence that would satisfy a heightened

23

actual innocence standard, they still required that you

24

satisfy the statute of limitations.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where -- where is that in

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the text?

What are you relying on in the text of 2244?

2

MR. BURSCH:

I'm relying on 2244(b), which

3

is the successive petition provision.

4

to, first, prove that you've got evidence of actual

5

innocence and then also demonstrate that you had

6

diligence.

7

It requires you

And, after you're already gotten through

8

what I'll call the actual innocence statutory gateway,

9

you're still required to satisfy the statute of

10

limitations.

11

wanted to make a situation where someone with evidence

12

of actual innocence did not have to comply with the

13

limitations period, they would have put an exception in

14

the successive petition subprovision and they didn't do

15

that, so -JUSTICE SCALIA:

unfortunate.

Unfortunately, the text is not

there, no.

20
21

You -- you don't have

2244(b)in your brief, do you?

18
19

If Congress was concerned about Schlup and

3

have an actual innocence exception only two

subprovisions earlier is strong reason to think Congress

5

didn't intend it here.

6
7

But I'm making a different argument now,
which is --

8
9
10

The fact that you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

Go

ahead.
MR. BURSCH:

Which is simply that Congress

11

considered the -- the instance where you've establish a

12

statutory actual innocence gateway in (b)(2), the

13

successive petition, and still require that it be timely

14

filed, because the State's interest in having notice and

15

an opportunity to investigate is so important.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But are -- are you saying

17

that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition?

18

Because this isn't a successive petition.

19

MR. BURSCH:

No, this is not.

What I'm

20

using the successive petition provision to demonstrate

21

is that, consistent with the legislative history,

22

Congress is demonstrating here, in 2244(d)(1)(D), that

23

there is no special actual innocence --

Congress knows how to write --

3

MR. BURSCH:

Yes, I am --

4

-- an exception if -- if

5

they want it.

6

petitions and this is really before that.

7

But this (b) does apply to successive

MR. BURSCH:

Well, my -- my point is that,

8

if Congress anticipated that actual innocence could be a

9

gateway to circumvent the limitations period, then

10

certainly they would have put that exception in the

11

successive petition of (b)(2) where they said, all

12

right, if you establish actual innocence, we're still

13

going to make you comply with the limitations period.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, now, your

15

friend on the other side, I think, argues that that --

16

they put that in expressly because they limited what

17

7

of your first petition, that it is a statute of

8

limitations subject to exceptions, including the

9

manifest injustice one.

10

I mean, there is a presumption that's been

It would seem to me that if they intended

11

not to have that apply, they would have done what they

12

did with the successive petition, but they chose not to.

13

MR. BURSCH:

Justice Sotomayor, the history

14

of this statute and of the case law isn't quite that

15

way.

16

this case and Holland, with respect to history.

17

respect to equitable tolling, you did have decisions

18

going back to the 1800s recognizing that Federal

19

statutes of limitation in all kinds of contexts, civil

20

and criminal, were subject to equitable tolling.

And I want to draw a sharp distinction between

21

With

And so then, in Irwin, 6 years before AEDPA,

22

you actually create a presumption that, if Congress

23

doesn't specifically -- you know, exclude equitable

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, I'm going to move to

and manifest injustice.

9

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

-- are cause and effect

So the cause and effect,

10

the manifest injustice, the actual innocence, really

11

starts to develop in 1986, and it comes to fruition in

12

Schlup in 1995, right before AEDPA is passed.

13

Importantly, that exception was always applied to

14

court-created procedural bars, never once to a Federal

15

statute of limitations.

16

And, obviously, the separation of powers

17

considerations are quite different when you're talking

18

about a court-created exception to a court-created bar.

19

The first is a bar that's enforced by Congress itself.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're creating a world

21

in which this would function as an exception to a State

22

time limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit.

23

MR. BURSCH:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

That's correct.
Why does that make any

sense?
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BURSCH:

Because it was the Court itself

2

that created the judicial exception to the State filing.

3

And so then -- or, I'm sorry, that created the bar with

4

respect to the State filing.

5

completely within the Court's power to make an exception

6

to that bar.

7

And so then it was

But, again, here, the separation of powers

8

considerations militate differently when you're talking

9

about Congress doing the telling, and this Court has

10

acknowledged, in Launcher and Dodd and other places,

11

that Congress gets to set the parameters of habeas.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I thought we said, in

13

Missouri v. Holland, that AEDPA was -- was enacted

14

against a background rule, which stated that normal

15

equitable principles, such as this one, which had been

16

applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA

17

suggested that those would -- that AEDPA was

18

against a background that those would continue to apply.

19

MR. BURSCH:

Well, it was a very short

20

background, one with no Irwin-like presumption and one

21

that, again, had never ever been applied to a Federal

22

statute of limitations.

23
24
25

And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why is a Federal statute

of limitations any different?
MR. BURSCH:

Because it's Congress and
22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Congress is the one that's handcuffing the Court with

2

respect to the scope of the --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but, again, it's

4

Congress but we said, in Holland, that it's Congress

5

and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this

6

presumption that normal equitable principles would

7

apply.

8
9

MR. BURSCH:

But here's another way to think

about it -- you know, if you imagine the -- the template

10

that you have on your Microsoft Word, when you're doing

11

a document, an opinion, whatever, you've got certain

12

stuff that's on the template.

13

that when it comes to equitable tolling, you've always

14

got a subprovision Z, call it, in every Federal statute

15

of limitations that appears on that template, And so

16

Congress has to do something affirmatively to strike

17

that out.

And you said, in Irwin,

18

Because the miscarriage of justice exception

19

had never been applied to any Federal -- Federal statute

20

of limitations, there wasn't a miscarriage of justice

21

exception sitting on the template.

22

from scratch.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Congress have thought that there would be any difference

25

in -- with respect to a statute of limitations?

because of the State interest in notice and

10

litigating a claim that could have been litigated

11

earlier and is going to be litigated now.

12

of evidence, the record that supports the claim, is

13

already defined and is not going to change.

14

The world we're dealing with in

But the world

15

2244(d)(1)(D) is when new stuff has come forward, and,

16

if that new stuff sits in the jailhouse cell for 10, 20,

17

30 years and we don't have an opportunity to talk to

18

those witnesses, to do counter-investigation, then not

19

only are we prejudiced with respect to delay and

finality and things like that, but we're prejudiced with

respect to the merits determination of what that

Justice Alito is describing -- you know, a situation

that, when you keep adding hay to that pile, not only is

it harder to find the needle, the truly meritorious

felt that the evidence was not new, in the sense that it

6

was reasonably -- potentially reasonably known at the

time of trial, which I think is one -- was, one, the

8

wrong legal standard, but, two, was a misinterpretation

of Schlup because Schlup allows you to consider all the

2

applied the miscarriage of justice exception to acts of

3

4

had included, in 2244, an ends-of-justice provision

5

which seemed to allow the Court to consider the ends of

6

justice when considering whether to hear a successive

7

petition, which is, essentially, the equivalent of

8

miscarriage of justice.

So, for instance, in Sanders, the -- Congress

9

It did not include that language in 2255,

3

MR. READLER:

I think I can agree with that

4

because there was never a statute of limitations before

5

AEDPA.

6

But -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And the

7

difference is, in Holland, we are dealing with equitable

8

tolling, which had applied as far back as -- you know,

9

whatever the law goes to limitations; in other words,

10

equitable tolling, which is different from the

11

abrogation, I think, that you are asking for.

12

MR. READLER:

Well, I don't think so,

13

Mr. Chief Justice.

Two responses, first, with respect

14

to the timing issue, the Court had applied the

15

miscarriage-of-justice exception to abusive petitions.

16

So there is a timing concern invoked there

17

because you're filing a second petition when you could

18

have raised issues earlier.

19

even in that timing context, not a statute of

20

limitations, but it certainly invokes timing concerns,

21

that even, in that instance, the miscarriage of justice

22

would still overcome the rule.

23

Now, what --

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

And the Court has said,

Well, you are asking for

what is, potentially, a very big exception to the 1-year
36
Alderson Reporting Company

statute of limitations.

3

would say they are actually innocent?

4
5

10
11

"Very few" would say they

are actually innocent?

8
9

few of them could credibly say --

6
7

If you took a poll of all of

Well, I haven't done that

I suspect very few of them would say that

they -- credibly say that they are actually innocent.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Oh, "credibly say."

But how

12

many would say that they are actually innocent?

13

And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is

14

equal to -- to what the petition -- what the Respondent

15

here has come up with.

16

A lot.

Now, do you think it's -- it's plausible

17

that Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute

18

of limitations, because it doesn't want these things to

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that plausible, given

what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA?

3

MR. READLER:

Absolutely, Justice Alito, for

4

two reasons.

5

of course, given the established nature of this

6

exception -- in fact, on Mr. Chief Justice's question,

7

while this exception, as compared to equitable tolling

8

in the criminal context, I think is actually more

9

important because it goes to the ultimate equity, and

10
11

First of all, the background presumption,

that is innocence.
But the background presumption is that

12

Congress includes these foundational equitable rules, of

13

which the miscarriage of justice exception is absolutely

14

one of them, unless Congress expressly says otherwise.

15

Now, Justice Alito, no -- no petitioner is

16

going to want to find themselves in the Schlup world,

17

where they missed the statute of limitations.

18

a place they are going to want to be.

19

evidence which goes to support a claim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think

limitations would run from the discovery of the new

23

evidence, not from --

Justice Ginsburg, to the extent that the evidence goes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to support a claim.

2

discovery rule.

3

that -- that supports the factual underpinnings of your

4

claim, that starts the one-year period over again.

5

Congress included a typical

If you've discovered new evidence

But, critically -- and I think my friend and

6

I have a disagreement here -- critically, with respect

7

to that provision, if you find evidence that solely goes

8

to your innocence, that provision is not triggered,

9

meaning you don't get another year if you find

10

completely exculpatory evidence that shows you're not

11

innocent, you don't -- you don't necessarily get another

12

year.

13

And there's a hypothetical I can give you.

14

If your underlying claim is a Batson claim, a

15

structural error claim, and you fail to raise it, and

16

you missed the one-year limitations period, but then, 10

17

years later, you find DNA evidence that completely

18

exonerates your client that was unknown to anyone, so

19

it's not the basis for an IEC claim, it's not the basis

20

for prosecutorial misconduct, in that instance, the

21

statute doesn't start the limitations period over.

22

You're entirely out of luck, which is why

23

Congress had to have meant to include the absolute --

24

the innocence exception for just that kind of case, so

25

that that petitioner at least has the ability to try to

Alderson Reporting Company

meet the Schlup standard.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that's very odd because,

3

if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then

4

you're saying that person can't get out of prison,

5

unless the person happens to have a good constitutional

6

claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the

7

person is actually innocent.

8

That's just very odd, isn't it.

9

MR. READLER:

Well, I don't think so,

10

Justice Alito, in the sense that all this is, is a

11

gateway to allow them their first opportunity to bring a

12

Federal habeas petition.

13

14

Ordinarily, they're out of

But, if they brought evidence that is so

15

compelling, that shows that there may well have been a

16

miscarriage of justice because this person has shown,

17

under the Schlup standard that they're actually innocent,

18

then, in that instance, the Court has always said that

19

we're going to allow those claims to be heard, at least

20

in the first instance, by -- by a Federal court for a

21

first petition.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your friend responds

23

to that point, I think, by saying that every State

24

allows collateral review in that instance and that what

25

we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second

you may be able to pursue that under -- under the --

under the State rule, but that is more akin to a

15

freestanding --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

is that the most -- I thought I understood your friend

18

to say -- he can correct me if I'm wrong -- that every

19

State has an avenue for considering that.

20

MR. READLER:

Well, two responses.

One, I

21

think every State has different rules and so this -- the

22

application of the exception is never turned on sort of

23

what the alternative potential State rule is.

24

wasn't -- that was true in House and true in Schlup,

where there were State alternatives.

But, two, those State alternatives go to

freestanding innocence claims, where you're not --

you're not alleging that there's an underlying

constitutional violation.

That's a completely different

And what we're getting at here is the case

allegation of a constitutionally corrupt trial.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Counsel, I see --

Well, assuming for the sake

15

of argument that there is this exception, why shouldn't

16

diligence be required?

17

someone to bring a claim when the person has --

18

involving new evidence, when the person has not been

19

diligent in presenting this new evidence to the court?

20

MR. READLER:

How can it be equitable to allow

Well, Justice Alito, for

21

decades, this Court has never required diligence and, in

22

fact, in McCloskey, has expressly rejected it, and the

23

Court has noted that diligence has not historically been

24

required under the standard because, as the Court said

25

in House and Calderon, that Congress raised the bar in
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

two places on the statute.
But the reason why is because, as

3

Justice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion with --

4

with -- in Withrow, with Chief Justice Rehnquist, is

5

that innocence is the ultimate equity.

6

diligence is not the ultimate equity, it's innocence.

And it trumps --

7

And if -- if a petitioner can come forward

8

and make a credible showing of actual innocence, that,

9

standing alone, has always been enough to allow a

10

Federal court to at least go ahead and then reach the

11

underlying claim.

respond, the -- Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

2

So he's asking you, I think, to tell us how

3

to write it.

So do we write it by saying there's no

4

diligence requirement -- but there is a sort of common

5

law laches, although that's a hard argument to make

6

because it was based on 9(a) until recently.

7

Or do we just say it's equity, and equity

8

would suggest that, if it's contrived -- the delay is

9

contrived, that the evidence is suspect and doesn't --

10

and shouldn't be credited.

11

MR. READLER:

Absolutely.

Two responses.

12

First, just with respect to Rule 9(a), Chief Justice

13

Burger, in a concurring opinion to a dissent in

14

Spalding, said that even a laches rule would give way,

15

if there was a colorable showing of actual innocence.

16

With respect to the rule I'd write, I would

17

write the rule that is essentially already in place, and

18

that is that the miscarriage of justice exception does

19

not turn on diligence; it turns on whether you can show

20

innocence.

21

And in -- in attempting to show innocence

22

under Schlup, this timing -- the timing of the

23

submissions is a consideration.

24

there's been a delay that, somehow, hurts the State

25

because a witness has died or that it appears to be that

So if there's -- if

51
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that's the fault -- or that the petitioner was playing

2

games in that context, I think that's a fair

3

consideration under Schlup.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is this

6

established after -- after some kind of evidentiary

7

hearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular

8

purpose or not?

9

MR. READLER:

Well, it depends.

If -- if

10

the petition is filed 3 weeks after the star witness

11

dies, presumably, the State will come back in their

12

petition and note, one, all the evidence that they think

13

goes against the -- the petitioner's claim, but, also,

14

they'll note that this happened, and the court could

resolve it at that stage, too.

21

three, he didn't have access to his legal papers.

22

of his legal papers were lost in a prison riot and then

the vast majority of cases, the finality and comity

concerns that the State has are honored because there's

But, in the rare case where a petitioner can

satisfy Schlup, the Court has always said that the

Shouldn't -- if there is an actual innocence

MR. READLER:

I think, ordinarily, yes.

The

Sixth Circuit said, here, that there was a gateway, and

13

it was remanding the case back to the district court --

Yes, but it didn't find

like this case -- just like the Court did in Schlup,

2

where it announced the standard and remanded back to the

3

district court for application.

4

But, here, I disagree with that reading of

5

the underlying opinion, in that the Court doesn't set

6

out in sort of weighing all the evidence and saying,

7

here's what I find in favor of the petitioner and here's

8

what I find in favor of the State.

9

court said is that -- it said the timing of the evidence

What the district

10

was somehow a problem because the information was known

11

at trial, which I think is, again, wrong for two

12

reasons.

13

I think the petitioner has -- is able to use

14

the information because the problem for us was his

15

attorney was told about some of these things, but didn't

16

actually assert them -- or didn't interview one of the

17

key witnesses.

18

prosecution's witness list, and my client's lawyer

19

didn't even interview that person, let alone call them.

One of the affiants was on the

And then the court -- I think the court --

21

the trial court misunderstood Schlup because Schlup

22

allows you to consider all the evidence, old and new,

23

make appropriate credibility determinations, consider

24

the timeliness of the evidence, and determine whether

25

that standard has been met.

And I think that's what should happen here

2

for the -- for the first time, in our view.

And there

is a question -- there was a question, earlier, with

respect to how often the Schlup standard is met.

5

response to the reply brief, we did a search of circuit

So it's --

It shouldn't be difficult

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I mean,

14

the whole question -- and your friend made the -- made

15

the point -- the question is how many are filed, in how

16

many cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's

17

upheld.

18

MR. READLER:

Sure.

Mr. Chief Justice, I

19

suspect, no matter the rules, there will always be

20

filings by petitioners, and many of those may be

21

frivolous.

22

other cases -- you know, unmeritorious petitions can be

23

dismissed at the earliest course, and it's consistent

with Habeas Rule 4.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5
6
7

MR. BURSCH:

Three brief points about

Holland and some closing thoughts about diligence.
With respect to Holland, I want to note,

8

first of all, that, there, you were dealing with

9

legislative silence.

10
11

Everyone agreed that Congress had

not said anything about equitable tolling.
And, as I explained earlier, when you

12

consider the three categories of defendants who claim

13

actual innocence based on new evidence, this situation

14

here, where the new evidence relates to the factual

15

predicate of the constitutional claim asserted, that's

16

where Congress, most clearly, meant to have the

17

limitations period apply.

18

So it's very different.

With respect to

19

equitable tolling applying to acts of Congress, everyone

20

recognizes that.

21

has never been applied to limitations.

22

to take issue with my friend's statement that Sanders

23

and Kuhlmann, somehow, took a different tack because, in

24

both of those cases, what Congress did is it left it to

25

the district judge's discretion to do or not do

Mr. Chief Justice, you note that this

60
Alderson Reporting Company

I actually have

Official

1

something.

2

And all this Court said was, well, if

3

they've got discretion, then they can still have an

4

equitable exception.

5

miscarriage of justice exception has never, ever been

6

used to override a congressional act.

7

So, even in those cases, this

The last thing is that, in equitable

8

tolling, you are dealing with the fault of the

9

petitioner -- Hurricane Katrina or something else

10

happened that wasn't their fault.

And, here, it's

11

entirely within the Petitioner's control.

12

All they have to do is print the form, check

13

the boxes, attach the evidence, and then file the claim.

14

And they have an unlimited time to find evidence and

15

then, 1 year after that, to file.

16

Now, with respect to diligence --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, you had suggested,

18

earlier, some way out of this puzzle about why Congress

19

would have put the actual innocence exception into the

20

second successive petition provision and not had one for

21

a first petition?

22

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So that seems really quite

24

odd to me.

I mean, a number of my colleagues have said,

25

well, can we really believe that Congress contemplated
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this.

2

contemplated it in the second and successive context, a

3

slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to

4

say that Congress contemplated an actual innocence

5

exception when you are on your second petition, but

6

barred it when you are on your first?

7

What sense would that be?

8

MR. BURSCH:

9

But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress

Yeah, let me explain that and

I'm glad you raised that because -- you know, besides

10

the legislative history that informs what we are looking

11

at here, what they did in 2244(d)(1)(D) is they made it

12

broader.

13

if you are coming forward with new evidence, we want the

14

court to hear that constitutional claim, if you bring it

15

within one year.

They said, even if you don't claim innocence,

16

The reason they didn't mention it there is

17

because it would have made the provision narrower, and

18

they didn't want to do that.

19

with respect to successive petitions, making you pass

20

through the successive petition actual innocence gateway

21

and then comply with the limitations period, so that's

22

the explanation, consistent were with legislative

23

history.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:
sure I understand that.

Then they ratcheted it up

Well, I guess I'm just not

I mean, they could have added a
62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

separate provision, just saying there's an actual

2

innocence exception, or there is -- there's not,

3

consistent with the way they did it in the -- in the

4

second and successive petition.
MR. BURSCH:

5
6

again, that would have limited (d)(1)(D).
JUSTICE KAGAN:

7
8

Right, they could have, but,

Well, it didn't have to.

Why would it have necessarily have limited (d)(1)(D)?
MR. BURSCH:

9

Well, if they said there is an

10

exception for those who claim actual innocence, the

11

implication is, for those who don't claim actual

12

innocence, you are out of luck.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

13
14

Well, you just you make the

converse clear.
MR. BURSCH:

15

Well, if we could rewrite

16

congressional statutes with hindsight -- you know, maybe

17

we could draft a perfect statute.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

All I'm suggesting is that your

19

interpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly

20

that people would be out of court on the first petition,

21

and they could turn around on their second petition,

22

which is usually disfavored, and get an actual innocence

23

exception.

24
25

MR. BURSCH:

No, that -- that's not the way

that we interpret this at all.

Under either provision,

63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you are stuck with (d)(1)(D), you have got to file

2

within a year.

3

it is that you do have a statutory actual innocence

4

gateway to pass through first that you don't have on your

5

first petition.

6

All that the successive petition adds to

That's our position.

I do want to close with some thoughts about

7

diligence.

You know, looking for counsel, we've talked

8

about how simple it is to -- to file these things.

9

papers lost in the -- the prison riot and the access to

The

10

the library are related, and it's because Defendant

11

Perkins incited the prison riot, so he is hardly in an

12

equitable position of -- of claiming any tolling benefit

13

from that.

14

And with respect to the -- the rule,

15

Justice Breyer, we can't have a diligence rule if you go

16

to that point, based on intent, because the interest

17

that is being vindicated here is not the purpose of the

18

Petitioner in --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think about the

20

words "discovered in exercise of due diligence"?

21

know, you could manipulate those words so as to deal

22

with the circumstance of the -- say, below-average IQ

23

person who doesn't have a lawyer, who isn't certain

24

about what to do, and what counts as diligence and

25

discovery in that case.
