ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Under Part A of the Medicare program, the

12

Federal government pays out more than $230 billion

13

annually to more than 30,000 institutional providers,

14

including more than 6,000 hospitals.

15

to which each of these providers is entitled is

16

determined by a fiscal intermediary on the basis of a

17

cost report.

18

The total amount

The statute provides that a provider may

19

obtain a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement

20

Review Board, only if he appeals the intermediary's

21

determination with -- within 180 days.

22

For the almost 40 years of the existence of

23

the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, the Secretary,

24

pursuant to her broad rulemaking authority, has

25

prohibited the board from extending that period, and
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instead required dismissal of the appeal, except as

2

specifically provided in the Secretary's own

3

regulations.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Kneedler,

5

there's a little bit of at least facial incongruity in

6

your position.

7

Congress sets in place the 180-day limit.

8

Then you say, oh, well, that, we can go beyond that.

9

The Secretary puts in the 3-year limit, and you say

10

that's it -- you know, that's the dead drop-off.

11

would have thought what Congress says is entitled to

12

greater weight than what the Secretary says.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

I

Well, the 180-day limitation

14

here is not a limitation applied to suits filed in

15

court, in which the court is the relevant tribunal, and

16

the court has -- has itself construed the statute's

17

regulating access to the courts or the appellate courts

18

as a matter -- a matter of internal judicial

19

administration.

20

This deadline governs an appeal within the

21

Department of Health and Human Services, and that is

22

something that Congress has delegated the responsibility

23

to the Secretary to construe the relevant statutes and

24

to adopt the relevant regulations pursuant to her broad

25

rulemaking authority.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So in -- in this setting, it is the board

2

that is the relevant tribunal, and the rules governing

3

the board's jurisdiction are established --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

Excuse me.
You don't mention Union

7

Pacific in your brief.

8

you're doing setting your jurisdictional limits?

9

we say, in Union Pacific, that agencies can't do that?

10

How can you be calling what

You can't define your own jurisdiction.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I -Now, you may or may not

13

be able to establish claim processing rules.

14

think, is a totally different question.

15

continue to use it as jurisdictional language?

16

Didn't

MR. KNEEDLER:

That, I

But why do you

Well, I was responding to --

17

first of all, the -- the Secretary's regulations have,

18

from the outset, referred to these limitations as

19

limitations on the board's jurisdiction.

20

this is set forth in the -- in the regulations

21

promulgated --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is --

Well, in that respect, I

23

think the amici is right.

You can't -- if they're

24

jurisdictional, we've clearly said that equitable

25

tolling doesn't apply under any circumstances.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And we -- and we

2

clearly believe that equitable tolling does not apply.

3

That would be fundamentally inconsistent.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what is good cause,

5

if not some form of equitable tolling?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

There is nothing incompatible

7

between a good cause -- a limited good cause extension

8

and a jurisdictional rule.

9

For example, in -- in the several cases that

10

this Court has considered finding provisions to be

11

jurisdictional, the time for taking an appeal and the

12

time for petitioning for certiorari are both

13

jurisdictional, but both allow extensions for good

14

cause.

15

involved the extension for good cause.

16

In fact, this Court's decision in Bowles

So the question here for the Secretary --

17

and, again, this is just a narrow question of good

18

cause.

19

would be -- would be permitted.

20

It in no way suggests that equitable tolling

The narrow question is whether the Secretary

21

permissibly construed the statute to allow a comparable

22

good cause exception, where -- where something akin to

23

an act of God would prevent the provider from actually

24

appealing within the requisite period of time, just like

25

the district court can extend the appeal period.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the Court's

2

decision in Henderson against Shinseki, that also

3

involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet, we said that

4

equitable tolling was permissible.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I mean, there are a

6

number of differences there.

7

was not intra-agency.

8

the Board of Veterans Appeals to the Court of Veterans

9

Appeals, which is a separate body.

10
11

I think, technically, it

It was an appeal from

It is not something

under the jurisdiction of the VA.
The VA was not given rulemaking authority

12

over that, unlike here, where the board is under the

13

Secretary's jurisdiction, and, in fact, she has adopted

14

regulations that have been in place for 40 years, which

15

have expressly barred any extensions and treated that

16

limitation as jurisdictional.

17

Also, very much unlike Henderson, this

18

statute is not one comparable to a statute regulating

19

benefits for veterans, to which there has always been a

20

solicitude by Congress and the courts --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Kneedler, do you

22

think you could do the same thing in the veterans'

23

benefits context?

24

dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding

25

whether equitable tolling was available.

Because in Henderson, of course, we

7
Alderson Reporting Company

All we were

Official

1

saying was that this was a claims processing rule and

2

not a jurisdictional rule.

3

Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then

4

go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but

5

still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we

6

want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like

7

the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3

8

years?

Could you do that in Henderson?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think, in Henderson,

10

there would have been the problem that the rule, as I

11

understand it, was a rule to -- for appealing to the

12

Court, which was outside the -- the Secretary's

13

rulemaking authority; whereas, here, this is a body

14

within HHS over which the Secretary has rulemaking

15

authority.

16

But, yes, we -- we think that the Secretary

17

clearly had -- and she has very broad legislative

18

rulemaking authority under this statute -- has the

19

authority to adopt strict limitations, as she has done

20

on that --

21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could she -- could she

have adopted equitable tolling?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- we don't think that she

24

could have.

We think that, as we say in our brief,

25

quite aside from the Secretary's regulation, we believe
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the sort of open-ended equitable tolling that the court

2

of appeals has imposed on this program for the first

3

time in 40 years is fundamentally inconsistent with a

4

need for repose, especially given the sophisticated

5

nature of these providers, as this Court noted in the

6

Your Home nursing home case --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess the question I was

8

trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a

9

general principle of administrative law that, when there

10

is a claims processing rule that -- that relates only to

11

internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide

12

how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow?

13
14
15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

We -- we certainly do

believe that.
For -- for -- in the first place, most

16

agency time limits are established by the agency itself,

17

pursuant to regulation.

18

statutory 180-day limitation period here and the

19

Secretary had adopted a regulation imposing that, then

20

whether -- and the extent to which that provision would

21

be open to extensions for good cause, for some degree of

22

equitable tolling, whatever the factors, would be up to

23

the Secretary in construing her own regulation --

24
25

So if there had been no

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, you refer to these --

to the providers as sophisticated, and that certainly is
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

true.

But are they really in a position to double-check

2

the calculation when -- if it were true -- and I know

3

you don't agree with this -- if it were true that

4

information needed to make the calculation was

5

intentionally withheld, concealed?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as you say, we do

7

not -- we do not agree with that.

8

the district court in this case, which was the same

9

district judge who sat in the Baystate case, disagreed

10

And the findings by

with that -- with that conclusion.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I understand that.

12

But if that were the case, would their sophistication

13

allow them to double-check this?

14

something that is dependent on data that they cannot

15

access?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Or is this just

Well, it -- it may be more

17

difficult.

19

administrative -- massive data files of 11 million

20

Medicare claims, I think 6 million SSI claims.

21

This was a situation which required the

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

There may be -- there may be

7

situations in which the provider would not know that,

8

but the need -- but the need for finality under this

9

program, we think, requires an across-the-board rule.

10

Otherwise, a provider could come in -- as this Court

11

suggested in the Your Home case, circumstances --

MR. KNEEDLER:

First of all, we do not

20

remedy in that situation.

21

But let me point out, if

find incompatible in your argument is you -- you assert

5

that this is a jurisdictional limitation.

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

concerned.

8

said that the board -- this is jurisdictional, and the

9

board has no equitable powers to --

10

The board has said and the Secretary has

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you think of any other

11

instance in which we have found something to be a

12

jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or

13

agency, subject to that limitation, to extend it?

14

I had always thought that once you say it's

15

jurisdictional, it means you have to abide by it.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

I --

As I said, in -- in Bowles,

17

the Court was dealing with the jurisdictional time limit

18

for an appeal, but there was a comparable -- there is a

19

comparable statutory provision for the Court to extend

20

that period for good cause.

21

That was the point in Bowles.

22

question of whether the --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It remains jurisdictional.
It was -- there was a

Well, if there is another

24

statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory

25

extension is part of the jurisdictional limitation.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That's fine.

2

But when you just have a jurisdictional 180

3

days, without any statutory provision for extension, if

4

it's jurisdictional, I thought that's the end of the

5

game.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And -- and the -- the

7

question is -- some time limitations have been

8

understood to contain explicit -- excuse me, explicit or

9

implicit authorizations for the tribunal concerned.

10
11
12
13

this -JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, you don't need that

14

label, do you, Mr. Kneedler?

15

with a claims processing label.

16

better, as Justice Scalia is suggesting, with a claims

17

processing label, as long as, with that label, comes the

18

general rule that the agency gets to determine the

19

extent of discretion as to late filings.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

You could do just as well
Maybe you could do

Right.

This is a

21

mandatory -- this is a mandatory -- even if

22

nonjurisdictional, it is a mandatory limitation.

23

the question is whether the statute contains an implicit

24

authorization, whether the Secretary could permissibly

25

construe it to allow for this narrow good cause
14
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

exception comparable to the one for extending the

2

time --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem with taking

4

that approach, of course -- and I assume why you assert

5

that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long

6

history of both the board and the Secretary regarding

7

this as jurisdictional.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, that is --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. KNEEDLER:

They have said it.

10

-- that is -- that is

11

correct.

But we -- but I think it's also important to

12

recognize that the -- that this statute was enacted, the

13

regulations were adopted before this Court's recent

14

jurisprudence identifying some things as jurisdictional,

15

some things as claim processing, primarily focusing on

16

the judicial situation.

17

Here, we have a statute governing procedures

18

in an administrative agency and regulations adopted at a

19

time before that -- that bifurcated way of looking at

20

things arose.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But that --

22

that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle

23

is.

24

what you think, that -- that the way to look at these

25

cases is, using ordinary principles of statutory

I mean, I would have thought -- but I'm not sure

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation, would a reasonable legislator, having

2

enacted these words, intend to give the agency a degree

3

of leeway in interpreting the statute?

4

Now, if that's the basic question, it helps,

5

but isn't determinative whether you classify this as a

6

claims processing rule or a jurisdictional rule.

7

are conclusions.

8

leeway that the Congress intended to -- to delegate to

9

the agency that is determinative.

Those

But, really, it's the question of

If the answer to that question is yes, your

10
11

rule stands, regardless of label, and if the answer to

12

the question is no, it fails regardless of label.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's --- that's correct.

14

And I want to make clear that under, whatever the answer

15

to that precise question, the Respondents in this case

16

lose because whether -- if it's an absolute rule to

17

which there can be no exception or the Secretary's

18

regulation allowing a limited exception is valid, in no

19

case would the sort of open-ended tolling regime that

20

the court of appeals imposed be permissible.

21
22

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of

COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

3

MR. MANNING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4

to treat the time limitation prescribed by Subsection

6

(a)(3) as absolute; that is, as not subject to waiver

7

and not subject to equitable tolling.

9

First, Congress chose to locate that
provision in the very part of the statute that defines

that determines the class --

But

24

in several cases, this Court has held that similar

25

17

to invoke the power of the tribunal, that those are

2

jurisdictional statutes.

3

the question whether they can be -- they must be framed

4

in terms of the power of the board or in terms of the

5

right of the party to invoke the power of the board.

6

The Court has never addressed

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We have talked about

7

what the -- the fact that there almost is a presumption

8

of a claims processing rule, rather than jurisdictional,

9

unless Congress is clear about that.

10

What policy supports an argument that we

11

should be reading limitations of this kind as

12

jurisdictional, particularly when, on the same day the

13

statute was passed, the agency, invoking its regulatory

14

powers, treated it like a claim processing?

15

your colleague argues, a good cause exception, the

16

3-year exception, everything else is -- is really

17

treating it like a claim processing rule, not as

18

jurisdictional.

19

MR. MANNING:

Whatever

Justice Sotomayor, you're

20

entirely right, that the test that this Court has

21

prescribed in this area of law is focused on

22

congressional intent.

23

the touchstone is congressional intent, that -- that the

24

design of this Court's rules is to put the ball in

25

Congress' court.

In Arbaugh, this Court said that

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

This Court has put a thumb on the scale

2

against jurisdiction because of the hard consequences

3

that follow from deeming a procedure jurisdictional.

4

this case, the agency's regulation, no matter how old it

5

is, is invalid because Congress signaled a clear

6

intention to treat this as jurisdictional in two ways:

7

One, by putting it in the -- in the provision of the

8

statute that defines the board's jurisdiction.

9

secondly, Congress, in this statute, created two

15

fundamental difference in the way Congress treated these

two sets of deadlines, and the fundamental difference is

that Congress explicitly gave the Secretary authority --

evidence that Congress was aware of the regulation and a

clear signal that Congress meant to embrace or put in

And this is a sound policy because Congress

leaves regulations in place for all sorts of reasons

equitable tolling the same as fraudulent concealment,

with what the plaintiff could have done or not done, but

6

Assuming I'm willing to accept that, is

MR. MANNING:

Justice Sotomayor, this Court

8

has said that, if a time limitation is jurisdictional,

9

that limitation is absolute.

tolling.
In Irwin, this Court included among the

Justice Sotomayor, then even if the -- even if the CMS

19

intentionally withheld this information, the time limit

20

would be absolute and would not be extendable.

On the other hand, I believe that if the --

the statute is not jurisdictional, it's subject to

10

defendants should not benefit from their own misconduct.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why -- why do you say

12

that?

I mean, the record that we have says that the CMS

13

failed to use the best available data.

anything about deliberate concealment.

Alderson Reporting Company

in -- in that case, the district judge there didn't

2

say -- he said they didn't use the best available data.

3

He didn't find any deliberate concealment.

4

MR. ROTH:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

5

because the -- that issue was not before the court and

6

it was not necessary for the court to make that finding

7

for purposes of addressing that case.

8
9

I'm at the Joint Appendix at 2829, which is
paragraph 38 of our complaint.

And paragraph 38 in our

10

complaint presented one aspect of this concealment,

11

which was a misleading aspect of the agency's actions

12

here, where the agency said that matching on the basis

13

of Social Security numbers was the best way to deal with

14

this -- this matching of the data that my colleague from

15

the government was -- was discussing.

16

And it ends up that the -- that it turns out

17

years later that, in fact, the Secretary didn't match on

the basis of Social Security numbers.

20

disproportionate share hospital benefit would be

21

And that made an

So -- so the reason the district court in

23

the Baystate case didn't have to make findings about

24

fraud or similar fault or delve that much into the

25

agency action was because that case came to the court
29

through the traditional appeals process without

are talking about the disproportionate share hospital

payment, Your Honor, let me simply -- let me simply

10

mention that what we are talking about here are safety

11

net hospitals.

12

that provide services to -- to a high percentage of poor

13

people, and -- and Congress had found that those

14

patients are more expensive to treat.

We are talking about those hospitals

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

But, Mr. Roth, on -- on the

16

legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right,

17

that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we

18

read this statute.

19

the briefs in this case is that you and Mr. Manning

20

present opposite views of the statute, and -- and both

21

of you say the statute is clear as to your opposite

22

view.

23

If you -- one response to reading

And both of

1

you have kind of decent arguments.

2

And one response to that might be to say,

3

Mr. Kneedler is right, that the statute is just

4

ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different

5

ways, and both of you have presented good arguments, but

6

in the end, it really all goes to show that there is a

7

lack of clarity here, and then it's up to the agency to

8

decide.

9

MR. ROTH:

Well, of course, Your Honor,

10

the -- the statute is clear and equitable tolling is

11

permitted.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course -- of course, one

13

can always make an argument on the other side, and the

14

mere fact that an argument is made on the other side

15

21

misconduct -- you heard the government talk about the

22

need for finality.

6

So

there for fraudulent concealment.

11

So -- so do you have statutes, are there

12

statutes that say 3 -- or are there cases that say 3

13

years is not enough, that -- that you have to have more

14

than 3 years?

15

I mean, I guess they can't go back to fraudulent

16

concealment pre-Civil War -- you know, I mean, there's

17

some period that must be reasonable to cut everything

18

off, and what is that period?

19

If it isn't 3 years, what is it?

20

I thought 3 years is a pretty long time.

MR. ROTH:

What do the cases say?

Well, Your Honor, the Secretary

21

has addressed this question in the context of -- of

22

fraud or similar fault by providers, and they said there

23

should be no time limit at all.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's their view there,

and their view here, which is a different kind of thing,
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that 3 years is enough.

2

reasonable?

3

it's unreasonable?

4

The question is, is that

And do you have any authority that says

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought the 3 years

5

provision applied only to the Secretary, that she gives

6

herself 3 years to go back and sort things out, but only

7

gives you 180 days; is that right?

8

MR. ROTH:

9

The Secretary -- well, depends

what sort -- if the "sort it out" means recovering

10

overpayments, the Secretary has an unlimited amount of

11

time to recover overpayments that are the fault or

12

similar -- fraud or similar fault on a provider.

13

If it is not fraud or similar fault on a

14

provider, the reason the Secretary can't go back more

15

than 3-plus years is because the statute permits it.

16

U.S. Code 1395gg, which is not cited in the government's

17

brief, that says that, at the end of the third year

18

after payment, that the payment becomes final, as long

19

as the provider and the beneficiary was without fault

20

with respect to the payment.

21

42

So that 3-year limitation that the

22

government touts in 1885 was not a subject of an

23

administrative determination that they made.

24

simply they were -- they were following a statute.

enacted -- it promulgated a regulation, and the

5

means there will be no review at all, because --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you challenging -- I

7

mean, there is a rule that says that -- there is a

regulation that, for fraud, it's -- the time is

unlimited.

10

says, applies only to the provider, not to the -- the

11

government.

12
13
14

Are you challenging the agency's reading of
the word "party" in that regulation?
MR. ROTH:

Well, we -- again, this came to

15

the Court on a motion to dismiss, but we think that

16

the -- the Secretary's interpretation of that ruling has

17

changed from when it was -- when it was promulgated in

18

1974, when during the rulemaking process, they

19

specifically changed that rule to get -- to eliminate

20

the reference only to a provider, and it's to any party.

21

And so that rule ought to be applied in a

22

way that provides equilibrium, that it would apply both

against secretarial misconduct --

finality, and we don't go back after the -- after the --

interpretation from the Secretary.

10

MR. ROTH:

The -- well, the --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. ROTH:

And if not, why not?

Well, 1395gg simply says that

13

a -- that a -- that a provider and a beneficiary will

14

not be subject to overpayment recoveries, if they were

15

without fault.

16

And what we -- and whether it would be

17

susceptible for equitable tolling is not before the

18

Court at this point, but that rule at least is applied

19

equally on both sides.

20

In other words, if -- if the -- if a

21

provider was underpaid because of its own fault, this

22

case isn't about any -- any relaxation of that rule.

23

Providers are on the hook for that.

On the other hand, where a provider is

And here, Your Honor, the notice

When they issued --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Roth, I'm not certain

11

about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me

12

try something.

13

Now, are you saying that any time Congress

14

passes a statute saying -- you know, there is 30 days to

15

do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency

16

context now, as to administrative process, that Congress

17

necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and

18

that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling?

19

MR. ROTH:

Yes, Your Honor, that, if the

20

issue is the -- is the agency's own misconduct, that

21

Congress would -- to -- to read that Congress intended

22

in a situation under the -- like this under the Medicare

23

Act, where we're talking about a procedural right to

24

that -- to enforce a substantive right.

25

In other words, we have here providers who
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have provided services.

And under their agreement with

2

the Secretary, they provide services, and they get paid

3

for those services.

4

If there were an attempt to limit that

5

payment, to cut off that payment because of agency

6

misconduct, because of the expiration of a -- of a

7

statute of limitations, we don't believe Congress ever

8

intended that its payments would be cut off because of

9

agency misconduct that caused a provider to miss -- to

10

miss a deadline that caused the expiration of a statute

11

of limitations.

MR. ROTH:

So you're arguing for --

13

in a way, for a narrower rule than what the

Well, Your Honor, let me say that

16

the facts that you're talking about are addressed

17

explicitly in 42 CFR 405.980.

has said in that regulation is that, when there has been

19

clerical error, claims can be reopened indefinitely.

That's another indefinite time period.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what the government

Well, suppose it's just

22

what the Baystate court said it is.

23

concealment, but it is failure to use the best available

24

data.

25

It isn't deliberate

And I take it the argument you just presented
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct.

2

failure to use the best available data, not deliberate

3

concealment, wouldn't make it.

4

MR. ROTH:

So just

Well, in this case, Your Honor --

5

well, simply, if it was knowing use of bad data, in

6

other words, if the government, as in this case, was

7

aware that there was better data to be had, that would

8

rise to the level of the kind of conduct that could be

9

subject to equitable tolling; whereas, simple mistakes

10

are already addressed for the Secretary's

11

regulations --

12
13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what -- what

circumstances trigger equitable tolling, in your view?
MR. ROTH:

Well, equitable tolling is

15

certainly triggered under the circumstances of this

16

case, Your Honor, because --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but suppose that the

18

fact-finding turns out that the -- that there is no

19

deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to

20

use the best available data.

21

MR. ROTH:

Well, if we don't -- if we don't

22

have that extra level of -- of that -- of that level of

23

concealment, Your Honor, I don't think that we would

24

have the misconduct that this Court has cited in the --

25

in the Bowen case, and before that, in -- in Irwin and
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

footnote 4 in the -- in the Gluss case that would rise

2

to the level of which -- at which equitable tolling

3

would apply.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you would have to

5

prove that before we know whether there is equitable

6

tolling.

7

MR. ROTH:

We -- we -- well, we've made that

8

allegation in our complaint, Your Honor.

9

that -- that assuming those allegations to be true for

10
11

And we believe

purposes of this hearing, which -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but I'm asking you,

12

if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't

13

know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried

14

out the question of the character of --

15

MR. ROTH:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

If we --

16

if we get past this -- this -- this -- and there would

17

be a remand, it would -- the burden then would be on the

18

hospitals at that time to, in fact, show that equitable

19

tolling could apply.

20

The issue in this Court is whether it should

21

foreclose permanently the availability of equitable

22

tolling, even in the face of allegations of agency

23

misconduct -- excuse me --

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

I guess I'm not sure I
Are you saying that, in all
44

Alderson Reporting Company

1

of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable

only talking about misconduct or fraud cases -- you

cannot possibly know the -- the information that would

6

back up a claim and that we regard that as a good

7

excuse?

8
9

MR. ROTH:

No, Your Honor.

Whether it was

Henderson or -- or other cases, those cases recognize --

those cases have focused on what happened to the

it was a deadline that was missed.

There wasn't

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well because I thought that

most of your argument was built on the presumption in

those cases --

21

MR. ROTH:

Correct.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and whether it applied to

But now, you're saying that in the

So what about -- then let's

get back to the question I really meant to ask before --

10

you know, assuming they have some authority here to

write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is

12

not reasonable in this situation.

Well -I mean, you want to go back

What is the -- 100?

MR. ROTH:

5

I mean, what?

Well, Your Honor, in this

23

instance, the -- the question of how to limit a

24

circumstance where a provider is not getting paid --

25

gotten paid the amount promised by Congress, one way
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

to -- to limit that is by time.
But recall here, Your Honor, that the

3

Secretary could eliminate this issue entirely by simply

4

being more transparent.

5

This issue arises --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what I hear you saying

6

is go back to the Revolutionary War.

7

years to put the papers together, you're saying no time

8

limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution

9

because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases

10

or misconduct cases.

11

in there forever.

You've got to have some exception

12

MR. ROTH:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14
15

If it took 100

Well, if -Is that right?

If that is

your position, I just want to know.
MR. ROTH:

That is -- that is the position

16

because, in order to -- to prevail in equitable tolling,

17

we would have to show that the providers here were

18

diligent, and that's a self-limiting factor.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

And by the way, do

20

we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give

21

the agency's own determination some weight?

22

MR. ROTH:

The agency's own determination?

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

They'll come in and

say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause

And now, does the

judge give them some weight?

MR. ROTH:

If the Secretary here decided to

3

attack head-on this concept of equitable tolling and

4

deal with this question of finality straight up and

5

say -- you know, here -- here is how we think that --

6

that finality should be -- should be handled, even in

7

the -- even in the context of secretarial misconduct,

8

by, for example, saying within the 3-year period any

9

provider who feels that we've misrepresented data, come

10

in, you can come in and look at our data, but after 3

11

years, the time limit is over, I think that's a rule

that could exist, Your Honor.

3

have been from the complaint filed in the Baystate case?

MR. ROTH:

We brought our administrative

That was the first public

10

There were some providers who had an inkling

11

that some days might have been missed here or there, but

12

there was no sense in the provider community that that

13

arose from a systematic effort by the government to

14

miscount and then fail to disclose that it, in fact,

15

miscounted and had misrepresented how it had counted the

16

17

So, Your Honor, diligence, of course, will

3

that equitable tolling should apply in another time

5

In the

That case then goes up to appeal in the

6

Western District of Pennsylvania, and the -- and the

court says, you know what, we think equitable tolling

the board's finding that equitable tolling should apply.

10

And in that case, the -- the Secretary didn't leave it

11

there.

12

They petitioned for -- for the court to

13

revisit its determination, which the court did and

14

affirmed its decision with respect to the application of

equitable tolling.

At that point, the Secretary abandoned -- it

17

didn't seek an appeal.

to the board, and it -- and it -- and it allowed the

19

case to go forward, with that deadline having been

20

equitable tolled.

21

as somehow some kind of consistent view, it's not.

22

It allowed the case to go back

So when the government portrays this

This board has engaged in equitable

23

determinations going back for those 37 years that the

24

good cause regulation has been in place because it is

25

that good cause regulation that -- that forced the -50

the board to have to deal with these equitable questions

2

about whether -- whether or not the -- whether or not

3

the -- the claim should be considered timely, even

4

though the deadline had to be -- had to be extended.

5

The -- the facts that we have here, Your

6

This is an unprecedented case in Medicare, that we have

in the Southwest Consulting amicus brief, avoid having

12

those facts come to -- come to -- come to the attention

13

of the providers.

14

There will not be floodgates that result

MR. ROTH:

Well, I think that, when the

7

8

involving 4,000 cost years and 450 hospitals, those

9

probably mostly, if not entirely, or for the most part

10

relate to -- to this case.

Mr. Kneedler, just for

point of clarification, the 3-year good cause extension

under the current regulation.
