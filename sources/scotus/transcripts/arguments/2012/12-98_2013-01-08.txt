ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MADDREY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MADDREY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The Medicaid Act requires States to take

10
11

reasonable measures to seek reimbursement from liable

12

third parties and that States require recipients to

13

assign their rights for -- to payment for medical care.

14

The Act does not direct how a State must determine what

15

portion of a recipient's third-party recovery is

16

properly attributable to past medical expenses.

17

Carolina's procedure establishes --

18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

North

How do you know that ex

ante?

20

MR. MADDREY:

Excuse me?

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How could you ever know

22

that ex ante?

I mean, without looking at the individual

23

facts of the case, the 30 percent is going to be

24

underinclusive in some circumstances, overinclusive in

25

others.

So how do you deal with our holding that you
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are not entitled to the overinclusive portion?

2

MR. MADDREY:

Justice Sotomayor, the -- the

3

answer to that depends on whether the State has to

4

predict with certainty the amount --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Life is never certain,

6

and so I don't even go to that issue.

7

to the question, how can you, ex ante, predict --

8

particularly with a statute that wasn't based on any

9

empirical data -- that 30 percent normally is the right

10

amount?

11
12

I go just simply

You just picked it out of the air?
could pick 40, 50, 60.

13

You

How do we draw the line?

MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, the -- the statute

14

doesn't predict; it defines.

15

much out of a recovery they must allocate to satisfy the

16

repayment obligation.

17

would make it a presumption and you would have to defend

18

it as such.

19

It tells the recipient how

If it were a prediction, that

But here the statute defines the portion

20

that the State, as a condition of extending the Medicaid

21

benefits, tells the recipient they must allocate --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They must allocate?

Is the

23

State saying, You do not own that 30 percent of the

24

recovery, so you never get a property right in it, so

25

that there's never any problem about asserting a lien
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

against it?

2

I think that's sort of disguised by talking about

3

allocation.

4

I thought that's what's going on here.

And

I thought the State is saying, as to

5

30 percent of the recovery, you have no property right

6

in it.

Is it not saying that?

7

MR. MADDREY:

Am I wrong?

Your Honor, the State is

8

saying that as to the amount of Medicaid benefits

9

provided, the State has a right of recovery.

10

says that of any third party --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe -- maybe you didn't

12

hear my -- my question.

13

saying that you have no property right in the

14

30 percent?
MR. MADDREY:

15
16

My question is:

Is the State

The State has the right to

recover that portion.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

again.

19

right in the 30 percent?

20

"yes" or "no."

21

And it

Let me ask my question

Is the State saying that you have no property

MR. MADDREY:

I think that can be answered

And -- yes, Your Honor, the

22

position would be there is no property right in that --

23

in that percentage that the State has conditioned the --

24

the extension of benefits on.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, how does it have

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the right to announce that in a FELA case or in a Jones

2

Act case where those injured parties, they have a

3

property right in their protection but this statute

4

applies to that recovery as well?

5

MR. MADDREY:

If those -- if those litigants

6

are Medicaid recipients, it applies to them as a

7

condition of having received the State Medicaid

8

benefits.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So they can deny a

litigant a property right in that recovery?

11

MR. MADDREY:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

go in and ask for something you don't own.

14

how the plaintiff can go in and litigate a case if they

15

don't have a property interest that they can then assign

16

to someone else.

17

they would have standing to sue on your behalf if they

18

have no property interest in the recovery.

19
20

As a -I don't know how you can

I've never heard of such a thing, how

MR. MADDREY:
confused by the question.

Your Honor, I'm -- I'm
I was --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know

MR. MADDREY:

I don't know how you'd sue for

something you don't have a property interest in, Your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Justice Scalia's question.

3

MR. MADDREY:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

So go back to

The inner -There has to be some

interest in the 30 percent by the plaintiff.

6

MR. MADDREY:

The -- the 30 percent attaches

7

upon the recovery from a third party.

8

of action is for whatever sources of injury that

9

individual would have.

The -- the cause

To the extent the recovery is

10

for medical expenses previously paid for by Medicaid,

11

that's what the State's interest could --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I just clarify one

13

point?

Does this rule preclude parties, as we said in

14

Ahlborn, from stipulating to a settlement at all?

15

MR. MADDREY:

No, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your brief is not clear

17

on that.

They can still stipulate.

18

the stipulation, it hasn't been allocated that you can

19

recover?
MR. MADDREY:

20

It's only if after

Your Honor, the stipulation

21

must include the State as a party to it for it to be

22

binding.

23
24
25

That's -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what you're basically

now saying is that there can never be a stipulation.
MR. MADDREY:

There could be an advance
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

agreement, Your Honor, but --

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're saying that the

parties cannot enter into a stipulation.

4

MR. MADDREY:

If the parties are private

5

litigants, a plaintiff and a defendant in a medical

6

malpractice action, their -- their stipulation doesn't

7

bind the State.

8
9

All parties to this case agree that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can bind the parties

for other purposes, I assume.

There are other purposes

10

for which the distinction between pain and suffering and

11

medical expenses might make a difference, right?

12

What -- what if the parties agreed that it's

13

50/50?

Would the State take 50 percent then, or is the

14

State still limited to 30?
MR. MADDREY:

15

Your Honor, the statutory

16

percentage applies in that situation as well.

17

33 percent cap would apply.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. MADDREY:

The

Okay.

Again, the State's interest is

20

the amount of the Medicaid benefits it provided, capped

21

at 33 percent of the recovery.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

with 33?

24

did you come up with the number?

25

Why 33?

General, how do you come up

Why not 10 or 60 or 90?

MR. MADDREY:

Why -- how

The North Carolina General

Assembly first enacted it as it relates to Medicaid in

2

1988.

3

North Carolina going back to 1935 with a -- a statutory

4

lien applicable to medical providers in -- in civil

5

actions.

6

scenario in the 1988 provision.

7

It reflects a legislative history in

It became specifically applicable to Medicaid

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if this case is tried

8

to a verdict and there is a special verdict and the jury

9

says that 10 percent was medical expenses?

10
11

Would the --

the statute would override that?
MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, I believe the

12

judge imposing judgment following that jury verdict

13

would have to conform the verdict to the law.

14

if the verdict had said, there was 100 -- excuse me,

15

$1 million in punitive damages when there is a statutory

16

cap of $500,000 for punitive damages, the judge would

17

have to conform the verdict to the applicable law.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Just as

What's the difference

19

between that case and Ahlborn, where you have -- where

20

the State has agreed that a certain amount is

21

attributable for medical expenses, and then this

22

hypothetical that the jury has determined that a certain

23

amount constitutes medical expenses?

24

difference between those two?

25

MR. MADDREY:

What's the

In the jury verdict scenario,
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the State's not a party to that and didn't commit to

2

the -- to the portion that -- that was attributable to

3

medical expenses.

4

to countervene the statute, to enter a verdict in

5

violation of -- of the statutory requirement.

6

and here the statute tells the Medicaid recipient, in

7

advance, how much of any recovery, whether that be from

8

a settlement or a verdict, has to be allocated and paid

9

back to the State.

10

The jury doesn't have any authority

JUSTICE ALITO:

And --

Isn't the reasoning of

11

Ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the

12

medical expenses were and what -- what part of the

13

judgment this represents or the settlement represents

14

medical expenses, then only that much can be assigned to

15

the government?

16

that and the verdict situation.

17

And I don't see the difference between

MR. MADDREY:

The verdict situation would

18

depend upon what -- would be in the hands of the parties

19

to the lawsuit, what evidence was presented, what --

20

what theories were advanced.

21

any control over that.

22

The State would not have

It would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it can --

23

it can participate in that process, can't it?

24

its money's at issue?

25

MR. MADDREY:

Its --

The State can initiate a
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawsuit on behalf of its -- its medical claim by virtue

2

of the subrogation and the assignment of the right.

3

could participate in advance or it could participate

4

afterwards.

5

because, of course, if the State participates on its own

6

in advance, it would be for the full amount of the

7

medical payments.

It

But that doesn't come without costs

Here --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. MADDREY:

I'm sorry.
-- here 1.9 million, and the

10

33 percent cap would have no application.

11

only to amounts recovered by a recipient from -- from a

12

third party.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That applies

General, you were -- you

14

were telling me a little bit about the history of this

15

statute.

16

the State picked 30?

17

But why 30?

Is there any indication of why

MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, historically

18

33 percent or three times the medicals was the -- the

19

rule of thumb used in -- in tort actions that -- that

20

parties used that as the -- the methodology, the way to

21

come up with a value to the case, with the theory being

22

33 percent for the medicals, 33 percent for attorneys'

23

fees and 33 percent to the victim.

24

the underlying --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That was -- that was

If that's where it comes
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't

2

it?

3

MR. MADDREY:

Historically it does.

It's

4

been the policy of the State of North Carolina for

5

almost a century, as I referenced the lien statutes that

6

apply generally to -- to tort actions, to civil

7

recoveries, to protect the providers of medical

8

services, in those cases date back to 1935.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you a somewhat

10

technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention

11

because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind.

12

All right.

13

everyone accepts the rule and North Carolina agrees that

14

if you in -- in North Carolina advance to the victim

15

$50,000 in medical expenses -- now, you're never going

16

to get more than that back and you don't want more than

17

that back.

18

It's my understanding of North Carolina,

Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter

19

into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is

20

you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent,

21

whichever is less.

22

That's the rule, whichever is less.

So if the settlement is for $100,000, you

23

are not going to take more than 33, so you have advanced

24

50.

25

first situation is where a judge has said -- you know

Okay.

So you have basically three situations.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

what, I find that only $10,000 of this settlement is for

2

medical expenses.

3

more.

In that case you take $10,000, no

Is that right?

4

MR. MADDREY:

No, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh.

I got the impression

6

that if there was a judicial -- there are three

7

situations:

8

only 10 percent was medical.

9

situation where they stipulate that only 10 percent is

One is there is a judicial finding that
And the second is the

10

for medical, and the third situation is this situation,

11

namely there is no stipulation and there is no judicial

12

finding.

13

So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if

14

the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than

15

10 percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of

16

10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided

17

that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation

18

and no judicial finding.

19

that wrong.

20

on that because I think it makes quite a difference.

21

Now you're telling me I have

So you explain what the North Carolina is

MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, the statute

22

applies to settlements or judgments received by a

23

Medicaid recipient from a third party for --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know, but in the

settlement they stipulate that 10 percent is for medical
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the rest for pain and suffering.

2

North Carolina courts have not yet decided whether North

3

Carolina -- which would like more than 10 percent -- can

4

get it.

Is that true or not true?

5

MR. MADDREY:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. MADDREY:

8

That is not true, Your Honor.
They have decided?

The North Carolina Supreme

Court in the Andrews case said --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. MADDREY:

10
11

Now, I thought

Said?

-- said that the key point in

Ahlborn was the stipulation --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

This has nothing to do with

13

Ahlborn.

14

more than medical -- the medical expense, okay?

15

question here is how to figure that.

16

Ahlborn, we all agree, says you cannot get
The

So I thought that one way to figure it -- I

17

will just be repeating myself.

One way to figure it is

18

how much of this $100,000 settlement is attributable to

19

medical expenses as a judge would say.

20

telling me there is a case in North Carolina which says

21

if the judge himself says that 10 percent of the

22

settlement is for medical, that's not what California --

23

that doesn't matter according to North Carolina law,

24

and I'd like the name of the case, the State case that

25

says that.

any such case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

answer to that.

5

don't know the answer.

6

Your Honor, I'm not aware of

Okay.

So we don't know the

We know what you would like, but we

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you think the statute

7

may -- may give you the answer?

It says:

"Any attorney

8

retained by the beneficiary shall out of the proceeds

9

obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement

10

with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third party

11

by reason of injury or death distribute to the

12

department the amount of assistance paid by the

13

department on behalf of...up to 33 percent."

14

to judgments as well as to settlements.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It applies

You answered the question

16

with respect to jury verdicts.

different if it 's the judge that found the 10 percent

18

rather than the jury.

23

MR. MADDREY:
Justice Ginsburg.

I suppose it would be no

I would agree,

The statute --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I didn't hear Justice

Ginsburg's question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question that

24

Justice Breyer was asking about the 10 percent has

25

already been answered because we were told that if a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jury allocated 10 percent to medicals, it would not make

2

any difference, the statute entitles the State to

3

30 percent.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Basically you are saying

5

the judge would be required to give you your one-third

6

regardless of what the jury said.

7
8

MR. MADDREY:

Exactly.

As we said, he would

either have to conform a jury verdict to the --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So all those States that

10

have jury verdicts, special verdicts that require a

11

certain amount, they could avoid that by just simply

12

passing this law and avoid the anti-lien statute that

13

way?

14

MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, it would -- it

15

would depend how the State could rationally defend their

16

statute under their experience as consistent with their

17

jurisprudence.

18

province of --

19

Of course, tort law being primarily the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16 States already have

20

something close to a presumption of a percentage.

21

you have any evidence that in those 16 States where it's

22

only a presumption and not a fixed amount, that they are

23

falling apart because of it?

24
25

MR. MADDREY:

Do

Your Honor, I -- I don't have

any evidence as to the specific performance in those 16
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States.

That would leave 34 States that don't have one.

2

It also would raise the question of how many of those

3

States -- I believe the 16 States were the ones that had

4

some sort of procedure, some post-settlement either

5

hearing or trial to allocate --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. MADDREY:
1988.

In the absence of this

10

effective date of Medicaid how things were handled.

11

certainly for the last --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

General, on your theory am I

correct that the North Carolina legislature could amend

the circumstances --

Certainly a statute could be

Whether it could be defended under -- under

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's what I mean.

I

mean, on your theory it seems not to matter whether this

statute says one-third or two-thirds.

21

whether that's correct.

22

MR. MADDREY:

And I'm asking

Two-part answer, Your Honor.

23

As to the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid Act, if

24

the statute defines the amount of medicals as 230 --

25

excuse me -- two-thirds, that would present the same

Official

1

analysis under the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid

2

Act.

3

show a rational basis in its -- in its tort law, in its

4

jurisprudence.

The difference would be whether the State could

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm not sure about

6

that.

In other words, I'm assuming an amendment that

7

just all it does is it changes one-third to two-thirds.

8

And so your theory it seems to me would work the exact

9

same way.

Then you say, well, you need a rational basis

10

for doing that.

11

one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an

12

estimate of how much is medical and how much is not

13

medical.

14

to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third.

15

wrong about that?

16

But I thought you told me that the

So it seems that you would have the same basis

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Am I correct that what

12

you believe and what the courts have been doing in your

13

State, the lower courts, is that they won't approve a

14

settlement that doesn't have the one-third, and they

15

won't enter a judgment that doesn't have the one-third?

16

Is that correct?

MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, when there's a

statute to protect the State --

have been doing.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.,

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

12
13

MR. BROWNING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

The -- General Maddrey has steadfastly

15

argued that the North Carolina statute overrides a jury

16

verdict.

17

the language of the statute, but that illustrates the

18

very problem here, that this statute takes one-third of

19

a settlement or judgment regardless of the true facts of

20

the case.

I think his argument is well-grounded, given

And that is problematic under Ahlborn.

21

Justice Kagan, you had asked Mr. -- General

22

Maddrey about the basis for the North Carolina statute.

23

General Maddrey had referred to it being a rule of thumb

24

of three times medicals.

25

the Fourth Circuit's decision, which is based on the

But if you actually turn to

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

briefs that were filed in the Fourth Circuit, in the

2

petition at page 20A, the rule of thumb is actually

3

three times specials, which of course is different than

4

three times medicals because special damages would

5

include things like lost wages and various other things.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Browning, let me give

7

you a different rationale for this statute.

8

different from the one the State suggests, but it would

9

go something like this:

10

It's

There is an allocation that has to be made.

11

In making allocations there are two ways of doing it.

12

We can do it case-by-case, individualized

13

decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules.

14

And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are

15

cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more

16

inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking because in

17

individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too.

18

So this is a reasonable way to make an

19

allocation decision.

20

Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by-case

21

decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the

22

allocation that it needs to make between medical and

23

nonmedical damages.

24
25

And nothing that we said in

What about that?

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, I would

turn to the language of the Ahlborn decision which makes
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clear that States cannot lay claim to more than a

2

portion of a settlement or judgment that represents

3

payment for medical care or medical expenses.

4

When you have --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that doesn't

6

answer the question.

7

North Carolina, is one-third.

8
9

I mean that portion, according to

MR. BROWNING:

It is the State saying it is

one-third even though there is no basis and even though

10

you have cases like this where it's clearly not

11

one-third --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

says is the law.

14

for medical.

I mean, the State says one-third is

MR. BROWNING:

15

Yes, but what the State

Your Honor, if that is all

16

North Carolina had to do, of course, the Ahlborn

17

decision would have been dramatically different if

18

Arkansas had simply enacted a cap of 100 percent or

19

50 percent or 40 percent because, in the Ahlborn

20

decision, the State of Arkansas was only seeking to

21

recover 39 percent of the tort settlement.

22

And under North Carolina's theory, if

23

Arkansas had simply been bright enough to implement a

24

cap, the Ahlborn decision would have been completely

25

different.

And that makes absolutely no sense.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official

1

the Ahlborn decision indicates that there has to be a

2

process in order to fairly and appropriately determine

3

the amount that the State may --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you need, ultimately you

5

need an adjudication.

6

jury to decide what percentage of the total award is --

7

is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding.

8

Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a

9

separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really

10

for medical.

11

who believes that?

You have to leave it either to a

You know, they may say 10 percent is, but
You -- you need a proceeding.

12

That is awfully time-consuming.

13

as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be

14

very accurate.

15

going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score.

16

And I don't know how you go about determining how much

17

of a settlement is attributable to -- to medical

18

expenses versus other things, especially when the

19

settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical

20

expenses.

21

And -- and

I don't think a jury determination is

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

22

it is very easy for States to follow that and to put in

23

practices or procedures that result in appropriate

24

allocation of medical expenses.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do you do that?

8

can't be an irrebuttable presumption.

9

Moreover, it is perfectly appropriate if

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem is it

How does it work?

Because

10

I would imagine at the negotiation you have the -- the

11

victim's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer and the

12

tortfeasor's lawyer is interested that the bottom line

13

number be as low as possible and the victim's number,

14

that it be as high as possible.

15

lawyer, in fact, would like as little as possible to be

16

allocated to a source which is going to take that money

17

away from him.

18

And the victim's

So they can reach agreement.

What they will

19

do is say 1 penny is for medical expenses and everything

20

else is for pain and suffering, and that's very good for

21

the victim.

22

And it's irrelevant to the tortfeasor.
So -- so when you see that on a piece of

23

paper, what is it you are going to do?

24

proceeding are you going to have?

25

about a proceeding.

What kind of

And it's a proceeding

care; if that's what he wants, that's fine with me.

What's it going to look like?

We will have a

And the defendant's

He does care because the smaller amount

10

means that the victim is going to actually get to keep

11

more and that's all the victim's lawyer is concerned

12

about, and that's fine with the tortfeasor's lawyer

because otherwise he would have to pay more.

7

9

question.

But that's --

There are 16 States that have this procedure.

How does it work?

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, and in most of those --

works.

17

I want to know how it works.

MR. BROWNING:

We have put

How it really works in those

18

States is the States will -- will generally negotiate

19

with the State Medicaid agency and come to a fair

20

allocation without the necessity for a judicial

21

determination that's appropriate.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

an appropriate allocation.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

not happening?

Your Honor, it is a process

6

8

appropriate decision, and can consider all the facts,

the equities --

don't believe you could ever figure out the number.

artificial no matter what you do, so you might as well

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this is what I

13

envision happening, if the -- if the parties can't -- if

14

the State and the -- and the recipient of the -- of

15

Medicaid assistance can't come to an agreement.

16

Basically, you have to make an estimate of what the

17

damages would have been if the case had been tried and

18

then you determine that the medical portion of the

19

damages would have been 15 percent and so you reduce,

20

then you take the amount of the settlement, and the

21

amount of the settlement that is attributable to the

22

medical expenses is 15 percent.

23

would envision.

That would be what I

Is that not correct?

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, it is a matter of

13

the parties coming forward, presenting evidence as to

the damages in the case, perhaps an explanation as to

why the case settled for less than full value, and the

MR. BROWNING:

There would be nothing wrong

What is the

7

problem is, you have cases that are on the extremes like

this case where you have absolutely horrendous injuries

10

wherewithal to pay for the extent of the damages that he

11

caused.

Here, EMA's guardian had no option but to

settle the case for the available funds of $2.8 million.

satisfied with the presumption.

19

or Skidmore or something like that?

20

Is there any law here

I mean, is this like Chevron

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, I certainly think

21

in this case the fact that the United States Department

22

of Health and Human Services has filed an amicus brief

23

that points out that this sort of ill rebuttable

24

presumption, this sort of --

25

position.

2

when we decide this case, I see you have a reasonable

point, they have a reasonable point, that if both points

are reasonable, you get the benefit of some kind of

be appropriate to give Chevron deference to the
arguments of the United States -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

along the same lines?

14

Do

MR. BROWNING:

Well, we're dealing

Don't they get deference

No, Your Honor.

I don't

15

think -- the starting point has to be the Federal

16

statute, Medicaid's anti-lien provision, which is very

17

clear that no lien may be imposed.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it can't be

19

very clear because CMS took the opposite position before

20

this case, right?

21

MR. BROWNING:

I don't think that they took

22

the opposite position.

With regard to the letter that

23

was sent to Congressman Coble that that was a -- an

24

employee who was not within a policymaking decision, who

25

has to field thousands of these sort of requests for

that has been expressly disavowed by the secretary and

4

the director of CMS.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So I don't think we can

Could I ask you a question

6

on this different point?

Could the -- suppose the North

7

Carolina legislature passed a statute that says

8

something like the following:

9

which an item of damages sought is medical expenses, the

"In any tort action in

10

plaintiff may not recover for any other item of damages

11

until the full amount of the medical expenses is

12

satisfied."

13
14
15

Now, there they're just restructuring their
tort law.

Would there be a problem with that?
MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, I think in the

16

case of the anti-lien provision, that that would

17

effectively circumvent the anti-lien provision and allow

18

by the backdoor what we would contend would not be --

19

the State could not do directly.

20

potential problems with that.

21

different than the scenario that we have here, but it

22

does -- the starting point has to be the anti-lien

23

provision, which is no lien may be imposed.

24
25

So yes, I do see

Obviously, it would be

This Court in Ahlborn assumed without
deciding that there would be an implied exception to

But that -- that exception is very

2

limited.

recognized, a State can only lay claim to that portion

of the settlement that represents payment for medical

It has to be in the context of, as this Court

6

So until you have -JUSTICE ALITO:

Does Federal law -- did

9

MR. BROWNING:

No, Your Honor, I don't

believe that there is a requirement that Medicaid

11

beneficiaries would have to file a suit and try to

12

recover medical expenses.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you could have -- could

14

you have filed suit and disclaimed any -- any claim for

medical expenses, you only want to be compensated for

other things?

17

MR. BROWNING:

If -- first of all, there

18

would be some medical expenses that wouldn't be

19

Medicaid, medical expenses that were incurred by the

20

family.

21

given the language of the North Carolina statute, the

22

State would still be seeking one-third.

23

to take that route, it would be an extremely treacherous

24

route that you would be -- not being able to -- to get

25

full -- full recovery from the defendant, but still

But moreover, even in that scenario, I think

44
Alderson Reporting Company

So, if one were

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it would be the

4

defendant who's -- who's -- who's jiggering the system,

5

I mean, not suing for the medical portion simply because

6

the defendant knows that at least some of that portion,

7

if not all of it, would -- would go -- would go to the

8

State.

9

total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover

10

both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be

11

very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed.

12

that seems to me a real, I don't know, gaming -- gaming

of the system.

14

So, in a situation, such as yours, where the

MR. BROWNING:

And

I don't think it would be a

gaming of the system, Justice Scalia, if the State,

recovery of those claims and to remit one-third to the

And the States that have individualized determinations,

a number of different procedures for doing that.

Often, there will be no shared

What -- what the States are doing is

what the statute forbids is asserting a lien on recovery

that the States aren't even trying to find out what

They're looking to determine what proportion should have

been for medical expenses.

7
8

And you're telling me

How does that tie in with the -- with the
prohibition of the lien?

9

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think this Court

10

established in Ahlborn that the beneficiary and the

11

State, they respectively have interests in the

12

settlement that arises from the fact that in the tort

13

case the plaintiff has asserted claims for medical

14

damages and for nonmedical damages.
And so Ahlborn establishes that we need to

15
16

divide the two in order to determine what the State may

17

recover.

18

has an interest in the settlement that arises from her

19

nonmedical claims that can be allocated away by an

20

allocation method, such as one that gives -- that says

21

that 100 percent of the settlement must always be

22

allocated to -- to medical damages.

23

Ahlborn also establishes that the beneficiary

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- so you're saying that

24

the State can, in making this determination, in fact

25

take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount

2

in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by

3

determining how much should have been allocated to

medical expenses, right?

MS. ANDERS:

The State does have some

6

discretion to determine what the appropriate allocation

7

is --

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're messing up the

lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it.
MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think Ahlborn

11

establishes that we have to make some kind of division

12

of the settlement, and when the parties haven't done it,

13

there's no jury determination.

14

time before the allocation has been done what precisely

15

the amount the medical damages should be.

16

know because the plaintiff, the beneficiary, has

17

asserted nonmedical claims and she has compromised them,

18

we do know that she has an interest in the settlement

19

that arises from her nonmedical claims.

20

We don't know ahead of

So for instance, you can imagine the

21

situation in which a plaintiff has a claim -- a claim

22

24

In that situation, when the plaintiff settles for

25

pennies on the dollar, I think we -- we would have

So they're both equally concrete.

serious questions about whether a one-third allocation

2

to medical damages in that case would be appropriate.

3

But without an individualized determination,

4

there would be no way to know whether this is a case in

which the -- the blanket rule that the State has is

6

actually overestimating the amount that should be

7

appropriately allocated to medical damages.

Certainly.

So for instance, in

13

McKinney v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, this is a

14

district court case in Pennsylvania, what the court did

15

was it said, we have the settlement; we know how much

16

the past medical damages were because we know what the

17

medical bills were; and we can -- we can assume that the

18

jury, had this case gone to trial, would have awarded

19

100 percent of the medical damages because they were

20

provable and because there weren't disputes about --

21

about that.

then apply a discount rate for the uncertainty that the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why isn't -- the missing

lien provision is the part that says the State is

15

entitled to payment that has been made for medical

16

assistance for health care items -- and some other

similar language is in the statute.

18

They think their one-third rule is a good

way of measuring that.

You think that the one-third

20

rule as a rebuttable presumption is a better way of

21

measuring that.

government arguments like that where they'd say, and, by

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not -- you argue what

20

you want to argue, but I -- this is awfully technical

language.

22

It's a minor interstitial point.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that HHS

23

has -- has authority over -- over how a State recovers.

24

I don't see that it's part of the administration of the

25

statute committed to HHS.

So I -- you know, I admire

MS. ANDERS:

Well, HHS has -- the statute

requires the States to -- to enact reasonable measures

5

for recovery.

6

circumvents the anti-lien provision like North

Carolina's wouldn't be a reasonable measure, but there

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MADDREY

13
14

Thank you, counsel.

General Maddrey, you have three minutes

10
11

HHS thinks that a measure that

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MADDREY:

We have heard a lot about what

15

a State could or maybe should do, but what must a State

16

do under the Medicaid Act to fulfill its obligations?

17

The Fourth Circuit and respondents and apparently the

18

United States say they have to have a post-settlement

19

trial, I guess a trial to settle the settlement.

20

that, while an available option, is not a mandatory

21

requirement under anything that I can see in the

22

Medicaid Act.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Well, General, how about

24

this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here

25

because I think a State could come in, or I think there
56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and

2

say -- you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our

3

best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an

4

individualized decision-making on top of that.

5

But as I understand your argument, that is

6

not what you are saying.

You are making a very

7

different kind of argument, suggesting that you can peg

8

this number any place, no matter what the relationship

9

between the number and the actual allocation that

10

cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical

11

damages in the real world.

12

So if that's the case, what do I do?

13

MR. MADDREY:

Your Honor, the statute --

14

North Carolina's statute defines the amount that must be

15

included for the repayment by the Medicaid recipient.

16

It's not guessing after the fact, but instead providing

17

in advance, the recipe as to how to put the settlement

18

together.

19

And that makes it a bright-line rule, which I think you

20

need to compare to the alternative, which is this --

21

this, what the Fourth Circuit called a true value

22

hearing after the fact, after the settlement, how did --

23

how did they get there?

24

they should have done or what they could have done?

25

It tells the parties what they have to do.

Is it what they did or what

In this case you've got a $42 million damage
57

1

claim settled for 2.8 million --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do -- what do we

3

do with the Federal statute that says, You are not

4

entitled to a lien of any amount that is greater than

5

your medical expenses?

6

General's Office example, everybody knows that the true

7

value of medical expenses in a particular case was only

8

10 percent, you are still getting 30 percent.

9

we -- how do we honor the terms of the Federal statute?

And using the Solicitor

MR. MADDREY:

10

How do

Because the State statute says

11

the State never recovers more than its actual medical

12

expenses.

13

were 100,000 or 10 percent, the North Carolina statute

14

would say North Carolina gets up to one-third of the

15

settlement but never more than they paid.

16

If in that hypothetical the medical expenses

So by definition it can't be for something

17

that was not medicals.

And that's the bright-line rule

18

that the North Carolina statute creates.
