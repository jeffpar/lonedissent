ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GUPTA:

8
9

Thank you, and may it please the

Court:
All 50 States have public records laws.

10

47

11

of those States make access available to residents and

12

nonresidents on equal terms.

13

enforces a discriminatory access policy, and, because

14

commercial requesters make up the vast majority of

15

records requesters, out-of-State businesses bear the

16

brunt of Virginia's policy.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Virginia, by contrast,

When -- when was the first

18

of those laws enacted?

19

think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the

20

first to enact a sunshine law.

21

about that?
MR. GUPTA:

22
23
24

Do you know?

I think it's -- I

Is that -- am I correct

That's right.

In the '60s and the early '70s.

Virginia law was enacted in 1968.

And we don't deny

that -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

And you say that's a

5

fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by

6

Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until

7

the 1960s?
MR. GUPTA:

8
9

Well, to be clear, the modern

transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of

10

well-established common-law right -- rights to access

11

that are based, not on modern notions of transparency,

12

but on the right to secure property and other basic

13

interests -­

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

still exist in this State, don't they?

16

records of deeds and whatever the common law would have

17

covered?

18

MR. GUPTA:

But those -- those rights
Cannot you get

Well, it's true that -- that

19

Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of

20

Information law, but, if I understand their position

21

correctly, they would be entitled, as a constitutional

22

matter, under their theory, to preclude people from

23

other States from accessing even deeds.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Well, I'll ask them -- I

didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but

I guess we can ask them.

MR. GUPTA:

Well, my

client, Mr. Hurlbert,

3

is in the business of gathering property records for his

4

clients.

5

the deed, but what he can't get and what he principally

6

gathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment

7

records, and those are a much richer storehouse of

8

property-related information than simply the deed.

9

Now, it's true that, in Virginia, he could get

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you -- can you

10

explain that business a little more fully than you did

11

in the briefs?

12

records from all the States about tax assessments.

He's in the business of collecting

13

MR. GUPTA:

That's right.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And he -- and he does

15

that for a client who could very well ask himself.

16

what is the service that's being performed?

17

MR. GUPTA:

So

Well, he -- you know, he doesn't

18

just do the routine request.

19

companies are the ones who hire him.

20

they're routine requests, they can do them themselves;

21

although if they're not based in Virginia, they would

22

still have to hire a Virginian to do it.

23

The -- the large data
And they -- if

But they bring him in when there's some flaw

24

in the -- the routine process where the -- the State is

25

being recalcitrant or the local official is being

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

recalcitrant.

And he's an expert in being able to

gather

these -- these records and knowing the process is

3

knowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not

4

allowed to do.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

All -- all he has to

6

do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him,

7

right?

8
9
10
11

MR. GUPTA:

Well, he could hire someone from

Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort
of precisely what the -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you don't

12

have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a

13

letter saying, give me these documents, right?

14

MR. GUPTA:

He would still have to hire

15

someone, and that would be an increased cost.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- for

Well, an increased

17

cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right?

18

Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and,

19

when they come to your house, give them to me.

20

MR. GUPTA:

Yeah.

For the large data

21

companies -- you know, they will hire someone other than

22

him to perform this service.

23

talking about routine requests.

24

even for them, if you're talking about a -- a request

25

that isn't routine, if he has to do something further to

They will -- if you're
But even -- you know,

enforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his
name, or the data company will have to hire someone

3

other than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that

4

for them.

5

And then he will lose that business.
So the lower you go down in the food chain

6

of the data industry, the bigger the effect of

7

Virginia's policy.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How much -- how much of

an impact, in fact, does it have on his business?

10

mean, there are 47 States who will provide this

11

information.

12

MR. GUPTA:

I

Well, for -- for him, in the

13

Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing

14

access -- business in the Virginia market.

15

And, if other States were to have policies

16

like this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those

17

States as well.

18

business in Virginia, it completely cuts him off.

19

So if -- if the focus is on him and his

If the focus is on -- on what the effect is

20

in the aggregate, on the market as a whole, because most

21

public records requests are commercial requests, it's

22

going to have an effect on most commercial requesters

23

who are out-of-State.

24
25

And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Gupta, I -- I

understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not

Alderson Reporting Company

own

1
2

allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA
is the following:

requests

That the purpose of these -­

3

these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were

4

enacted -- government in the sunshine.

5

it was not to enable people to get information, per se;

6

it was to enable people to see how their government is

7

working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance

8

that is occurring in the process of government.

9

The purpose of

It seems to me entirely in accord with that

10

purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens

11

who -- who are concerned about the functioning of

12

Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever

13

records Virginia agencies have.

14

What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?

15

MR. GUPTA:

16

First, transparency was one purpose, but, as

A few responses, Justice Scalia.

17

I said, these laws also carried forward the much more

18

longstanding rights to access based on personal

19

interests and property interests.

20

time that these laws were enacted -­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Also, even at the

But -- but you don't need

22

any personal or property interest under these laws.

23

can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a

24

Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have

25

no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency

8
Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official

2

for records about this or that.

It -- it can't be

based on -- on the

3

traditional property interest.

4

ability of the citizens of the State to find out what

5

the -- what the government of the State is up to.

6

MR. GUPTA:

It's based on the

Even -- even at the time that

7

these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was

8

well-understood that they were going to have a big

9

commercial impact.

10
11

The property records industry was in

full swing by the end of the late 19th Century.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the point is that

12

FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens

13

should know what their government is doing.

14

don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part

15

of that political community.

16

allow people from out-of-State to vote.

17

part of Virginia's political community.

18

And you

Now, Virginia doesn't
They're not

So why isn't this -- if you're not part of

19

the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA,

20

which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is

21

covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't

22

have to give any reason for it.

23

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

Well, elections just

24

simply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to

25

participate in elections or if you can't wall off the

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

State in that respect.

But what the State can't say is,

simply because one purpose of this law is that we want

3

to constitute ourselves as a political community, that

4

we can exclude activities that have a big commercial

5

effect.
And -- you know, when we're looking under

6
7

the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and

8

Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said

9

repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original

10

legislative purpose, you look to whether there is

11

discrimination, which there is here, on its face, and

12

you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect.
One example of how this policy is actually

13
14
15

being -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And is the only thing that's

16

necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's

17

necessary that the law affect a few people commercially?

18

I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to

19

be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order

20

for your arguments to work?

21

MR. GUPTA:

Well, what this Court has said

22

is that there is no de minimis exception, if there's

23

discrimination against commerce, but, here, what's going

24

on is anything, but de minimis.

25

that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are

Virginia does not deny

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

commercial requesters -- the vast majority of

out-of-State

requesters are commercial requesters.
Their -- the amicus brief supporting their

3
4

side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus

5

brief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -­

6

policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial

7

requests are typically honored, but out-of-State

8

requests by data miners are being categorically denied

9

under the policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

But this -- this is

11

not -- this is not a regulation of commerce.

12

State practice that may have an incidental effect on

13

commerce, and the incidental effect may be

14

disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or

15

local, but it's not a regulation of commerce.
MR. GUPTA:

16

It's a

But that's -- that was the

17

Fourth Circuit's theory, and I think incidental can mean

18

a few different things, and I think in -- in their

19

opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different

20

things.

21

that.

22

So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack

If it means incidental in terms of the

23

effect on my client's business, I think, as I've

24

explained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely

25

forecloses him from the market.

If it means incidental

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute,
again, it's not incidental because the vast majority

3

of -- of affected parties under this policy are

4

out-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data

5

companies.
And -- you know, if it means incidental

6
7

compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said,

8

transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws,

9

but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the

10

longstanding rights of public access that have been

11

around since the -- the first settlements in the United

12

States -- or before the United States, when, in order to

13

have a functioning property system, we recognized that

14

you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and

15

those records have to be made available to anyone in

16

order to exercise property rights.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the State of

18

Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia

19

businesses, and so we're going to open a business

20

training, best practices institute, where you're going

21

to learn how to be a better business person, but the

22

only people who can come in are -- are Virginia

23

businesses.

24

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under your theory,

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect
commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is

3

that unconstitutional?

4

MR. GUPTA:

5

I don't think so.

And there are

a couple of distinctions.
First, that's not something that the State

exclusively is able to provide.

9

the road that runs between them that only the -- the

institute, so the State is just one player among many.

Also -- running a
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

But that -- that just goes

15

to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the

16

principle.

17

there's no such thing as a de minimis exception.

And you say extent doesn't matter.

18

MR. GUPTA:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

You say

No -­
So that -- that explanation

doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water.
MR. GUPTA:

21

Well, maybe I didn't explain it

22

very well.

To be clear, I think it's more than just a

23

difference in degree; it's a difference in kind.

24

are fundamentally different when -- when you're talking

25

about running the courthouse or running the public

Official

archives, nobody else can do that.

Nobody else

can collect -- you know, make

3

tax assessments, collect those records, and keep the

4

official public archive of those things.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

So what?

That -­

So what?

Except

6

to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an

7

imposition this is upon interstate commerce.

8

to me, that's the only relevance of that point.
MR. GUPTA:

9

Well -­

11

relevance.

impact is on -- on interstate commerce.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought, if

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about
impact.

3

MR. GUPTA:

That's right.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's right.

I thought a question

5

of talking about the effects on interstate commerce,

6

that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis.

7

MR. GUPTA:

No.

What this Court has said is

8

that -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny,

9

the per se rule is -- is for cases where there's

10

discrimination on its face or discrimination in effect.

11

And then you've got this other category for the -- the

12

Pike analysis, where the State regulates evenhandedly.

case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of

Well, Virginia doesn't deny that

question to be asking -- you know, what about the

22

commerce aspect?

you

can also look to Camps Newfound, which, I think -­

4

There, you had a generally applicable law, a property

5

tax law -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

If I only have time to read

one case -­

8

MR. GUPTA:

Yeah.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

would you like me to read?

11

the question.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. GUPTA:

-- or possibly two, which
I think that's, basically,

Yeah.

I mean -- you know, look.

14

There's no case that's -- that's entirely on all fours,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

But I assume you

don't want me -­

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. GUPTA:

That's why you're here.

So right.

So -- so -- okay.

So

21

the Camps Newfound case is -- is a case where you had a

22

generally applicable law.

23

It exempted -- you know, charities that served primarily

24

in-State residents.

25

It was a property tax law.

It was -- there is no evidence that the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

State of Maine intended that to be a -- you know, a

2

discrimination against commerce and, obviously, swept

3

more broadly and affected both commerce and

4

non-commerce.

5

had facial discrimination against commerce because there

6

were people operating these summer camps, and they were

7

treated differently -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

But this Court said that -- you know, you

I'll look at those.

But I

think the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its

10

objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a

11

legislature or decisionmaker within its State

12

discriminating in favor of their own State producers.

13

MR. GUPTA:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

Right.
Now, it's pretty hard for

me to put this case into that mold.
MR. GUPTA:

16

Well, I mean, one -- you know,

17

one piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media

18

exception to the Virginia statute.

19

makes it clear that Virginia was aware that people who

20

were requesting information for commercial purposes were

21

going to use this statute and they exempted the press -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

though, isn't it?

25

good, honest government in Virginia.
MR. GUPTA:

10

Well, if this is a statute, it's

a pretty unusual statute that discriminates among
newspapers, so it says -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

If it does what the -- I

12

had exactly the same question for both parts of your

13

argument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinking

14

that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any

15

State can get any information that pertains to him or

16

her?

Is that right or not?

17

MR. GUPTA:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GUPTA:

There is a separate Virginia -­

Yes.

Is that right or not?
There is a

separate Virginia statute that allows this.

22

to know, whether it's separate or not.

23

MR. GUPTA:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Okay.

That's what I wanted

That's right.
Anyone from Alaska to

Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or

her.

Second, that this has nothing to do with

2

judicial records, there is a different statute that

3

makes judicial records public.

4

MR. GUPTA:

That's correct.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So we're, now,

6

talking about the class of information, other than the

7

two classes I've mentioned.

8
9

And I then ended up -- and I'd like you to
add something to this, if you can, that, really, this is

10

about -- since getting information involves usually a

11

benefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the

12

person the information is about, that willing to run

13

that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good

14

government, okay?

15

MR. GUPTA:

Uh-huh.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, if that's the

17

interest, that's an interest that probably a State has

18

the right, just as it has the right to say other people

19

can't vote in State elections, if that's the interest,

20

then I guess it could take reasonable measures related

21

to that interest.

22
23
24

All right.

Now, that is the -- the argument

or the position that I would appreciate your addressing.
MR. GUPTA:

Sure.

You know, that -- we

25

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

don't deny that that's an interest that the State has,
then you have to see whether the -- the interest is

3

reasonably furthered by the statute.

And, here, you

4

have a resource that is not finite, and the statute

5

allows the State to recoup its expenses.
So nothing is lost to Virginians.

6

There

7

isn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by

8

extending access to out-of-State data companies.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if it costs for

It actually makes it less transparent.

something very strange with this statute because you

problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's

problem, which is, absent the statute, he can't demand

that's how he wants to work, correct?

Could I -- I'm still trying to

Nonresidents don't.

Would that satisfy you as valid?

cost on to out-of-Staters.

And -- you know, this -- this Court, in

14

cases like Toomer and Mullaney, have said that at

least -- you know, where the State can show that the

State is entitled to pass the costs on.

MR. GUPTA:

And this Court said, no,
That's just

But if, for example, the State could show

that there was -- you know, there were shipping costs

16

that were uniquely posed by nonresidents and they wanted

17

to assess a $5 shipping fee for all nonresidents, that

18

might be permissible.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. GETCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

The -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

I'm not sure how you

3

save administrative costs under this statute.

They

4

could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and

5

probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not

6

you, and get the very same information.
So how do you justify this discrimination?

7
8

Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is

9

going to be imposed anyway.
MR. GETCHELL:

10

I would -- would suggest that

11

the purpose of the statute, which is political, not

12

commercial, left the State with the position that it was

13

going to subsidize with tax dollars this function

14

because we can't recover our overhead; we can over -­

15

only recover the actual cost.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

So you want to give more

17

businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge

18

out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA

19

requests?

20

MR. GETCHELL:

No, Your Honor.

nature.
And I do want to -- want to repel the notion

4

that there is even substantial discrimination in this

5

case because Mr. Hurlbert, in his admission that this is

6

an as-applied challenge, has a difficulty with

7

substantial equality of access, because it turns out

8

that Mr. Hurlbert, in his reply brief, when he teed up

9

the 1786 statute, which does give access -- did give

10
11

access, he focused his argument on that statute.
And if you run that statute, you will find

12

that between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not

13

have general access.

They went back to having to show a

14

particular interest.

But that -- from 1840, '41 until

15

today, through the codes of 1819 and -- and up until the

16

present code, Section 17.1208, he has the right of

17

access to tax assessment records.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the -- if I

19

understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only

20

reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is

21

because of the added overhead costs?

22

MR. GETCHELL:

No, Your Honor.

It's just

23

5

people who request -- and I'd assume you would be able

them in such a way that inquiries for commercial

12

13

that are intended to look into the workings of State

14

government and produce government in the sunshine, don't

15

you think that they probably would have excluded

16

commercial inquiries, if they could?
But you can't tell which ones are commercial

does it have to be better than that?

24

first of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is

25

that, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State

And, as I heard it, this -- what I

real estate people could always get information about
property -- let's say they had a client who wanted to
buy it.
Now, you've protected that.

4

But, in today's

5

world, it's important that we get statistics about this,

6

too, because our economy is national.

7

how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to

8

what extent they increase the value, to what extent they

9

increase the rate, to what extent they really get the

10

money they are supposed to, to what extent they might

11

get money or not get money in the future.

If we understand

And all of those things are nationally

12
13

important, so that people can put them together and

14

make -- better than we have done in the past -­

15

predictions about what is likely to happen to States

16

and, hence, the national economy.

All right.

That's -- that's the kind of argument he's

And that

That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.

JUSTICE BREYER:

was sort of expanding it.

2

MR. GETCHELL:

(Laughter.)
But, in point of fact,

3

because he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the

4

clerk's office, in the case of Henrico County, where he

5

went, you go in the same building and -- if you're

6

Mr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction, you go to the

clerk's office.
And, if somebody in Virginia and wants to -­

book, instead of from the clerk's book, you turn in the

I would -- I would have about

5

three answers to that.

enterprise, they -- they want the Court to take that

15

into account.

inquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause,

11

that whether or not somebody can deal with an item in

13

And just, like in Reno v. Condon, where the State of

14

South Carolina was choosing to take its records and sell

15

them into the stream of commerce, there, the Court held

16

that -- that they thereby became a thing in commerce.

17

The records of the tax assessor of the

18

County of Henrico, which are available through the

19

clerk's office to Mr. Hurlbert, are not things or

20

persons in commerce, nor are they -­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting

So -- so suppose -- I mean,

I think they have an argument, saying, of course, this

8

statistics and helping the national economy.

9

that's true.

I think

10

On the other hand, you say, well, but, look,

11

there must be something left that the States can reserve

12

to their own citizens, there must be something.

They

13

can't protect their own commerce; that's clear.

They

14

can't discriminate against people who want to come here

That's clear.

They can't do this and that and the other

few cases on it.

MR. GETCHELL:

I -- I think there that -­

14

that the important policy issue in this case for us is

15

precisely as you articulated.

16

residual sovereign power in the State to act, and we

17

have to violate the Constitution, clearly, before we

18

lose that authority.

19

There -- there is

And, under existing privileges and

20

immunities doctrine, the privileges and immunities

MR. GETCHELL:

15

Take that argument out.

Because it is not an exercise

16

of the State police power to regulate commerce.

17

documents in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the

18

County of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce,

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you leaving it -­

21

you -- you switched now to-- and you were led there, but

22

you switched to the dormant Commerce Clause.

23

your other client, McBurney?

24

dormant Commerce Clause claim.

25

MR. GUPTA:

What about

Right.

He doesn't have any

And I -- I think the

test that I just laid out would work for both clauses.
limiting principle on the justification side.

3

But -- but that's right, Mr. McBurney does not have a

4

dormant Commerce Clause claim.

5

equal access to proceedings.

6

His claim is based on

He wanted to get recovery of child support

7

that he was owed.

So he is a creditor seeking to pursue

8

a debt on equal terms with people in the State of

9

Virginia, and the State set up a process.

As one step

10

along the way to court, you go to the agency, you ask

11

the agency to enforce.

12

enforcement tools.

13

The -- the agency has unique

It can suspend someone's driver's license,

14

for example.

It can -- it can intercept income tax

15

refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf.

16

he's asking for is the rules of the game.

17

know what procedures apply to that process.

18

least where a -- an agency has a process that directly

19

affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are

20

saying is that equal access to the proceedings means

21

equal access to the information governing those

22

proceedings.

And all

He wants to
And at

And, finally, I would just like to close by

24

saying that -- you know, what I don't think we heard on

they are not saying that this will cost them
anything more, which was the only justification they

And so

pressed in -- in the courts below.
And so they are left with the position that

5

they can discriminate simply because they think they

can.

Clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit

8

Clause, which indicates, if anything, that the framers

9

thought that the movement of public records across State

10

And, if you look at the Privileges and Immunities

lines was important to interstate comity.

11

They changed the Articles of Confederation

13

referred to judicial records.

14

judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that

15

that was important to -- to comity across State lines.

They added a mention of

17

before that.

It's about whether you get the records in
