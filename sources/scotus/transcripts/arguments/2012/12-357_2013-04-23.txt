Mr. Clement?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The crime of extortion under the Hobbs Act,

12

like the related crimes of larceny, burglary and

13

embezzlement, is at bottom a property crime.

14

Accordingly, understanding the scope of obtainable

15

property under the Hobbs Act is critical to deciding the

16

scope of the basic criminal prohibition.

17

The Government has offered you a definition

18

of property that only a prosecutor could love.

19

intangible right with economic value, but that

20

definition is fundamentally incompatible with this

21

Court's precedence and with Congress's conscious

22

decision in the Hobbs Act to criminalize the State --

23

New York State crime of extortion, but not the New York

24

crime of coercion.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Any

If the jury had -- had

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

returned the verdict, which is at JA142, and it had

2

marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the

3

commitment, you might still maybe have some causation

4

arguments, but I assume the property argument you're

5

about to make is just irrelevant.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think it's

7

irrelevant, Justice Kennedy.

8

argument.

9

on this Court's decision in Cleveland, where it

I would have a different

I think that I would stand first and foremost

10

recognized that something like, I think the commitment,

11

certainly the video poker license was at issue there,

12

the Court also referenced an unissued patent.

13

And it recognized that there are things that

14

have value once they're issued, but in the hands of the

15

Government, they don't have value, and therefore don't

16

qualify as property.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could -- could the case

18

have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in

19

which what they were taking was the commissions that

20

would ultimately have been generated?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, it

22

might have been possible to say that what was obtained

23

here was money, but I think if the Government had

24

prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove

25

that somehow the Government paid too much.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

Official

1

think it can point just to the commissions.

2

And I would analogize it to the McNally

3

case.

4

scheme in which various sort of friends of government

5

officials were getting the commissions from a workmen's

6

compensation policy.

7

it would have been one thing if the Government had come

8

in and said that the Government paid commissions that

9

were too high, or the Government had received inferior

10

In the McNally case, you know, there was this

And what this Court said is, well,

quality insurance.

11

But what the Government did there instead

12

was sort of take the shortcut and plead that what had

13

happened is, the Government had been deprived of its

14

interest in having the honest services --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, here, what the

16

Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately.

17

you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's

18

real money.

19

but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge

20

that?

21

And

It's for the Government to answer, not you,

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think the reason that

22

they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold.

23

One is that a commitment under New York law and practice

24

is not quite as what it sounds, it's not really a

25

commitment.

And the best evidence of that is with the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

last fund for this particular management company, they

2

got a commitment from the State and there was no

3

ultimate investment made.

4

So there's a subsequent step down the road.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. CLEMENT:

7

The other thing I would say is as in

I see.

I see.

So I think that's part of it.

8

McNally, I think they would have had to prove that the

9

management fees were somehow excessive or something like

10

that, so they -- they didn't do that.

11

this recommendation.

They focused on

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

your argument about intangible property.

15

Mr. Clement --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I took you away from

Mr. Clement, just along the

16

same lines.

17

not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's

18

position runs an investment company, wants an

19

investment, wants the fees that come along with that

20

investment.

21

person who gets to decide whether to make that

22

investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that

23

person, threatens that person with something terrible

24

happening to him.

25

What you're saying is that it still would

Goes to -- let's say that there's a single

You're saying that that does not count as
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

extortion, that there's a reason that the Government

2

didn't charge it like that?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

I would say that that -- I

4

would say a couple of things.

5

harder case than the one I have before you today.

6

would say that I don't think that's actually extortion

7

if what they charge is the commitment, not the money

8

that goes -- that flows from the Government.

9

what I would say -- and the reason I would say that is

10

I would say that's a

And then

because of Cleveland.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, they want the

12

investment with -- and the fees that come with the

13

investment.

14

the person.

15

I

So -- and that's why they're threatening

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

And I would say that

16

under McNally, in that kind of case, what the Government

17

has to prove is that if they want to make the property

18

the money interest that the Government is paying out and

19

the person is obtaining, they have to show that there's

20

some sort of excessive commission or excessive sort of

21

management fee.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Even -- even though they

23

wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't

24

have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force

25

or -- or violence?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Again, that would be my

2

position.

3

decisions in cases like Cleveland and McNally because in

4

McNally, of course, the people who were part of that

5

fraudulent scheme, they were getting commissions from

6

the workmen comp program.

7

And I think it would follow from this Court's

And the Government's theory was that just

8

interfering with the Government's decision about who to

9

give the workmen -- where to place the workmen's comp

10

policies was enough of an interference to -- to support

11

a fraud conviction.

12

the things it then said is well, it would be different

13

if -- if the Government went in and proved that the

14

commissions that were paid were too high, or that the

15

Government somehow got inadequate insurance.

And this Court said no.

And one of

16

But if all they're doing is saying that

17

what's going on here is sort of the interest of the

18

Government in having its employees serve them honestly

19

and in their best interest, and not in some third

20

party's best interest, that brings you squarely into

21

honest services.

22

a good thing, but it's -- it's the traditional office of

23

the State law crime of coercion.

24
25

And nobody's saying that doing that's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's --

But it's -- the coercion

crime, at least under New York definition, requires
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

force.

2

embarrassing fact.

And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an

3

So what -- am I right about that, that the

4

coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State

5

crime, requires a threat of force to restrict another's

6

freedom?

7
8

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't believe that's

correct, Justice Ginsburg.

9

This was charged by New York State

10

authorities as coercion.

11

Congress didn't incorporate into the Hobbs Act, the New

12

York crime of coercion, was charged here, and it's my

13

understanding that the New York crime of coercion, like

14

the earlier version of coercion in the racketeer -- in

15

the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, like the traditional

16

model penal code definition of coercion -- it's the --

17

the threat part of it is the same as extortion.

18

So the very crime that

So it covers a threat to a person or to

19

property.

20

include threats to disclose information like this.

21

And it's been interpreted certainly to

So I think the real difference between the

22

crime of extortion and the crime of coercion, both as a

23

general matter and under New York law, is whether or not

24

property is obtained.

25

problematic about the Government's definition here

And that's ultimately what's so

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because their definition is essentially the property

2

includes the autonomy interest of a business to operate

3

free from coercion.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is your definition

5

of -- of property?

6

saying that you're -- you are not arguing that the

7

property has to be tangible and includes some forms of

8

intangible property.

9
10

In your reply brief, you begin by

How would you draw the line?
MR. CLEMENT:

I would say that for property

11

to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on

12

obtaining property, it has to be alienable,

13

transferable, moveable.

14

the distinction is not between alienable and

15

inalienable.

16

That's the critical thing.

So

A patent is an inalienable -- I mean,

17

rather, a patent is an intangible property right, but

18

it's transferable, it's obtainable, it is sellable, and

19

so it has the characteristics of things that I think

20

come within the traditional definition.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about -- what about

22

the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead

23

or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is

24

because they have a monopoly, some other grocer who's

25

connected has a monopoly.

And they threaten him.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official

1

does that violate Hobbs Act?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

I think -What he did was -- and

he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

I -- I would say that

6

that hypothetical that you've given me would be

7

coercion, it would not be extortion under the Hobbs Act.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now, in fact,

they're doing it to get money, and they do get money,

10

but via the means of the other grocer.

11

nothing in the words of this Act that says that the

12

property has to be taken from the individual whom you

13

coerce.

14

And there is

It's easy to imagine situations where the

15

coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special

16

and so forth, with the person who has the money.

17

what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person

18

without the property so that he will do a thing such

19

that the person with the property gives them the

20

property?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

So

I think, at least as I

22

understand your hypothetical, where the relationship

23

between the two parties, basically they are competitors,

24

I would say that that's two distinct relationships.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Now just make

Official

1

it different.

2

bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing

3

such as shout at a certain time where they know that

4

that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank.

5

I mean, you know, it's easy to think up.

6

What they do is they get the assistant

What I can't figure out here is, is there

7

some requirement that the person who is coerced has to

8

be the same person as the person who gives them the

9

property.

If the answer to that's no, then none of the

10

Government's chamber of horribles is horrible because

11

there's a way around it.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

is, it depends.

14

definitive that the --

15

I don't think I can give you a

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

anything on this.

17

basically it?

18

Well, I think the answer to it

And you haven't found

You'd be making it up now, is that

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, what -- what I would

19

tell you is I think the assumption of most of the cases

20

is that the person that is the pressure of --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23
24
25

up the property.

Is the person who's offering

This Court's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:
"extort" means?

Is the -- is the one?

Isn't that what the word

You extort something from someone?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

means you get it from him, you don't get it from some

2

third party.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's basically

4

right, Justice Scalia.

5

think there's an exception to the -- at least to the

6

following extent, which I think it would be open to the

7

Government, to basically say that within an entity, if

8

you sort of put the pressure on one agent of the

9

corporation and you actually get the money from another

What I would say, though, is I

10

agent of the same corporation, that that's probably

11

close enough.

12

And so in this case, if the pressure was put

13

on a particular individual and they obtained like actual

14

cash from the Government, that might be a different

15

case.

16

commitment, which I think is analogous to the video

17

poker license in the Cleveland case, so I don't think

18

that's --

19

But, of course, here what they received was this

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if you think the

20

commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash,

21

real property, right?

22

that -- under what you just said, that the threat was

23

made to the general counsel rather than to the final

24

person who issued the money, isn't that right?

25

Then it wouldn't matter under

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I don't disagree with
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, Justice Kagan, but I think that's because they're

2

all sort of agents to the same principal.

3

sure you get all the way to what Justice Breyer was

4

suggesting, which you can sort of run it through

5

competitors or something like that.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

And I'm not

But you wouldn't

7

say, well, we're dealing with an organization, so it's

8

only extortion if you threaten the person who writes the

9

check?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

I --

If you threaten the person

12

who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the

13

check, that's good enough.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly, Your Honor.

But what

15

I would also say is, you know, this is a real case and

16

there are real jury findings, and as Justice Kennedy

17

alluded to, there were a variety of theories of property

18

put in front of the jury.

19

as many of them as they could, as many as they found

20

satisfied, and the only one they circled was the

21

recommendation.

22

They were invited to circle

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, what is --

23

I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to

24

get the word "property" to do the work of the "obtain"

25

part of the statute because when you answered
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Alito you were using the terms of "obtain" to

2

define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange

3

way to do things, okay?

4

of some sort and you don't use any of those words in

5

your definition.

6

Property generally means value

So what you're using in my mind, and not

7

illogically, is to say that the second part of the

8

statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that

9

you're taking something of value away from someone else.

10

That makes logical sense to me.

11

second piece of your argument, which is the

12

recommendation -- not the recommendation, but his honest

13

services were -- wasn't being given to your client, it

14

was being given to the employer.

15

And I understand the

So your client obtained nothing of value for

16

himself.

17

And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me.

18

And I tease it out of your brief, but I don't know why

19

you're trying to get our definition of "property" to do

20

that work.

He didn't get anything transferred to him.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

Well -Why isn't the work in

the "obtain" part?
MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy

to have you rule in favor of my client on "obtained" or
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"property" and, as Scheidler II demonstrates, those

2

terms are really kind of married together.

3

the reason I sort of think that the "obtained" and the

4

"property" should be construed together is twofold.

5

One, structurally that's what the statute does.

6

you're talking about, in a statute, property that can be

7

obtained, I think that's a clue that you're not talking

8

about property in its broadest manifestation.

9

And I guess

So when

And you contrast that with, say, the Clayton

10

Act that talks about disjunctively property and -- or

11

property rights, and there you have a clue that Congress

12

means a very broad conception.

13

it in conjunction with "obtained," I think it has a

14

narrower ambit in mind.

15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When it's talking about

So take the Government's

definition that property is anything of value.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
All right.

And let's

19

assume because it -- as I said, that seems to have some

20

sort of conceptual appeal.

21

me.

Then make the argument for

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

Well -Then make your argument

for me why this isn't an obtaining.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, what I would say is
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obtaining, as this Court made clear in Scheidler II, is

2

not some metaphysical obtaining.

3

was made to this Court that the abortion protesters

4

obtained the autonomy interest of the business in -- the

5

clinics, in deciding whether -- who to serve and when to

6

serve and when to be open and when to be closed.

7

I mean, the argument

And this Court said no, and it said

8

principally that that's not obtaining, but it's -- but

9

it also noted, I guess you'd call it dictum, that

10

what -- what -- obviously, what the Hobbs Act, based on

11

its common law roots in extortion, is talking about is

12

the kind of property that can be deprived, it can then

13

be transferred, sold, exercised.

14

And I do think.

Just to get the second part

15

of my answer out if I could, it's just -- the common law

16

roots here are also where you see the definition of

17

property can't be as broad as the Government suggests.

18

Because extortion is one of the classic common law

19

property crimes.

20

purposes of extortion, ought to be the same as the

21

definition of property for larceny, embezzlement,

22

burglary.

23

The definition of property, for

You can't go into somebody's house and steal

24

their honest services or their autonomy interests.

25

the kind of property you can obtain for purposes of the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

Hobbs Act is that same kind of alienable, transferable,

2

moveable property.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose -- suppose that the

4

person coerced here was a -- was a corrupt person and

5

had put his recommendation out for bids.

6

said, you know, I'll -- I'll recommend whoever pays me

7

the most money.

Okay?

He

Would that alter this case?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -If -- if then somebody

10

comes in and says, well, I'm not going to pay you the

11

money, but I'll -- I'll break your knees if you don't

12

recommend me, would that be extortion?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

It would not, Justice Scalia,

14

and I would say because -- if the State of Louisiana in

15

the Cleveland case, if there was a corrupt official who

16

was putting those video poker licenses on sale on the on

17

the sly, I don't think that would change the result there.

18

This Court said that those kind of government things do

19

not have value in the hands of the government.

20

that somebody, you know, could sort of be corrupt and

21

therefore have a little auction on the side I don't

22

think changes that basic fact.

23

The fact

I would say, too, that there's an important

24

difference here between a hypothetical case where what

25

somebody's trying to do is kind of get something for
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nothing and essentially get the benefit of the work of a

2

government official.

3

here.

4

But that's not what's at issue

This is not a client who's trying to get --

5

like, you know, they wanted an opinion on how to

6

incorporate in the State of New York and they thought,

7

well, the lawyers are kind of expensive in the private

8

sector, so I'm just going to coerce it from this

9

government official.

All they care about in this case

10

is the bottom line, thumbs up, thumbs down

11

recommendation.

12

I don't think this case would be any

13

different if there were an investment committee within

14

the State government and you had to get unanimous assent

15

to an investment and there was one holdout.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

you focused on transferability when you began.

18

isn't that completely transferable?

19

against this official and if you want him to recommend

20

yes on your investment, you have to pay me a certain

MR. CLEMENT:

Right, because -- but my point

is simply that if the Government -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to

the contract and the contract leads to the commission

and the commission means money in your pocket, that's

property.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

And so then we just have a

causation argument, not a property argument.

8
9

Yes.

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's right.

If

what's obtained is money, and that's what the Government

10

focuses its prosecution on, then that is -- that

11

satisfies the property requirement of the Hobbs Act.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

It has to be more property,

13

more money, more money in return for less services or

14

something than otherwise.

15

But I don't think that's -- I mean, right.

16

answer -- go ahead because I -- that's the qualification

you're making, the McNally qualification.

And the

So why

Official

1

doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right

2

taken from one and exercised by another?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I would say

4

that what you've just articulated is exactly the

5

Government's theory, and the problem is that I can use

6

that same theory to take any autonomy interest and turn

7

it into property that can be exercised, it can be

8

obtained by somebody and then exercised by them in a way

9

different from the way that the person would otherwise

10

exercise it.

11

And whatever -- I mean, you know, we're

12

talking about one word in a three-word phrase in

13

Scheidler II.

14

think it's a mistake to read that phrase the way you

15

would read a statute.

16

And the first thing I would say is I

But the second thing I would say is the one

17

thing the Chief Justice did not mean with respect to the

18

word "exercise" is it meant that it opened up a big gap

19

so you could take every coercion case and turn it into

20

an extortion case.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is this -- there is, I

22

take it, no Federal crime that this conduct would fit?

23

say this conduct might fit.

crime.

But there's no Federal

23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. CLEMENT:

There's -- there's no Federal

2

crime and that's the result of a very deliberative

3

decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act.

4

Of course, they had in front of them the model of the

5

Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 that prohibited both

6

coercion and extortion.

7

decision to, in the Hobbs Act, prohibit robbery and

8

extortion, but not pick up the prohibition on coercion.

9

And so there isn't a Federal crime directly

Congress made a conscious

10

on point, but it's a very conscious decision by

11

Congress.

12

is exquisitely on point because not only is there a

13

coercion offense under New York statute, but it is an

14

aggravated offense if the victim is a government

15

official discharging their public duty.

16

And, of course, the New York crime on point

And so this is really a situation where the

17

State courts have a crime that directly fits.

as -- I mean, it's almost amazing because it's not just

19

any State, it's the State of New York.

they were very happy to lateral it to the Federal

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start, if I could, where Justice

15

Kennedy began and ended, which is asking whether there

16

would have been extortion if the jury had found here

17

that what -- that the property that was obtained was the

18

commissions at the end of the day after the investment.

19

My friend Mr. Clement says no, no, no, McNally says no.

20

But what McNally actually said was the case

21

would have come out differently if the property that had

22

been alleged to be deprived was either money or

23

property, but it also said it would have come out

24

differently if the Commonwealth had been deprived of

25

control over how its money was spent.

type of property that's at issue here, control over a

property right.

Now --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Harrington, just to go

5

back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was

6

there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me

7

to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in

8

order to get an investment and in order to get fees to

9

put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's

10

extortion.

11

theory of the case?

12

So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, he was charged with

13

attempting to obtain the commitment, which in most cases

14

ends up being the investment itself.

15

the jury found was the property that was obtained, so

16

it's not the verdict that we are here defending today.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's not what

Do you think there's an

18

obstacle to charging a case that way?

19

to think that there's an obstacle, that even though

20

there's property in that case, there's some other

21

problem with charging the case that way.

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Clement seems

No, that's what I'm saying.

23

What he's saying is that the obstacle is you'd have to

24

prove that the State was out more money than it would

25

have been if it had invested in the company it wanted to
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

invest in.

2

result would have been different if the State had been

3

deprived of control, of the ability to control its

4

money, and that's the property that would have been

5

obtained in that kind of a case.

6

control of property are just -- are just different

7

aspects of the same property.

8
9

What I'm saying is no, McNally said the

Because property and

exclusive control of property is one vital aspect of

private property.

11

property that was charged, that was -- that was obtained

12

in this case.

13

And that's the -- that's the type of

JUSTICE BREYER:

The obvious problem, which

14

you might want to address at some point, is that -- that

15

if you take your definition that this recommendation,

16

legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said,

17

you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if

18

that's property, we're back to the honest services

19

statute because anyone in the government and anyone in

20

business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs

21

always require you to do things.

22

So if every time somebody threatens a person

23

and says, we don't want you to do the thing you're

24

supposed to do, we want you to do the thing like this,

25

well, then you're violating this property statute.

reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case --

the abortion clinic case, et cetera, and it is easy to

reconcile with the honest services case.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I guess I would have

two points.

9

York, it wasn't the citizenry of New York.

The first is that this is not about honest

That's the

kind of --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean, that sounds

12

technical.

13

by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within

14

the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is

15

an appropriate threat which has as a condition the

16

person doing the job differently?

17

whether it's a postman, you know, any public official,

any private official, anybody.

far-reaching.

you are taking.

Under the Hobbs Act -- the Hobbs Act
And in

10

that -- in the -- in the cases construing that law, they

11

had construed the word "property" to include the running

12

of a business, the engagement of a person in their

occupation, and the doing of a job.

14

property interests in doing those things because those

15

are the source of economic wealth for those people.

their lives on.

making a recommendation, he was attempting to dictate

the substance of what the recommendation was.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here, what Petitioner was

Yes, I understand that.

But I still would like an answer to my question, and
30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

it's well-phrased with an example by Justice Kennedy.

2

Every secretary in the United States who is

3

about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to

4

college or some other thing then is faced with a threat,

5

you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of

6

no, and is under your definition that person's property,

7

that what she does the taking of property?

8

is either you think yes, in which case I would like you

9

to defend it --

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or the -- yes.

The answer

Okay.

Then

12

what conceivable ground?

13

that sounds a little pejorative, but I say, what

ground is there for a definition that is so broad that

15

it sweeps within it all working people in the United

16

States in the performance of their ordinary jobs?

17

I'm not -- I don't want to --

MS. HARRINGTON:

The ground is the general

18

particularized meaning that the word "property" has

19

obtained in the law, and including in New York cases

based.

extortion.

17

committing extortion was doing violence to property, it

was harming property.

in -- in both provisions, Section 850 and Section 851,

those sections.

And in that -- that was the case that

said doing a person's job, the person has a property

2

interest in doing their job.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Harrington, go back to

4

the Scheidler example because that was a case where we

5

said there was not extortion when there were threats of

6

violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's

7

operations.

8

threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion

9

clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic

What you are suggesting is that if those

10

to shut down their operations because they were a

11

violation of law, that it would be an entirely different

12

case.

13

Now, how could that be?
MS. HARRINGTON:

We -- that's absolutely

14

what we are saying, in the same way that we said that if

15

the target of the -- if the -- if the protesters, excuse

16

me, had been trying to get the clinics, if they had been

17

trying to take over the clinics and get them to provide

18

a different type of service, to get them to be a

19

restaurant or to provide a different type of medical

20

service, then they would have been obtaining the right

21

of the -- of the clinic the right to run -- to operate

22

their business.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so you think if -- if

24

they targeted the -- the clinic's lawyer or the -- if

25

the threats were, Don't shut down the clinic, instead,
35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

start delivering babies, that that would be extortion,

2

whereas in the real case it wasn't?

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes, because Scheidler came

4

out the way it did not because there wasn't property at

5

issue, but because there wasn't an obtaining.

6

think it's important to try to keep those two things

7

separate.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I do

Well, because there

wasn't -- and there's nothing obtained either way.

I

10

mean, you are trying to change what the person is doing,

11

but you are not getting anything from it.

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

But you are dictating the

13

substance of what they are doing, and so you are

14

obtaining their right to exercise their property right.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that -- that's the

16

problem with your New York cases as well.

17

are focusing on property in another context, where the

18

property is harmed, not whether property is taken.

19

You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other

20

common law case involving extortion where the property

21

taken consists of somebody's doing his job.

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

You -- you

It's true, but the New

23

York courses -- the New York cases said that they were

24

construing the word "property" to mean the same thing as

25

used -- used in both places in the statute.
36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And there is no reason to -- to define the

2

word "property" to include the concept of being

3

obtainable because the statute already separately

4

requires that property be obtained before there is

extortion.

6

Just, if I can just note that --

I'm not sure that

obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one

little bit to Justice Breyer's question, how do you gain

4

possession of someone's advice or how they do their job

5

when it's not giving you a direct benefit, it's

6

something that belongs to someone else?

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

What you are doing is --

8

what happened in this case is Petitioner was attempting

9

to obtain control over the fruits of the general

10

counsel's labor.

11
12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the problem, this

obtaining controlled concept.

MS. HARRINGTON:

4

the recommendation was.

5

in the indictment, that's what the jury found.

6

where the obtaining came in.

7

He wasn't just trying to keep him from

And that's how it was charged
That was

The -- the concept of property and control

8

of property is well illustrated by this Court's decision

9

in Carpenter.

There the property -- one of the pieces

10

of property at issue was confidential business

11

information, which was taken from The Wall Street

12

Journal.

13

But it wasn't -- it wasn't really taken from

14

The Wall Street Journal because The Wall Street Journal

15

still had the information at the end of the day.

16

the Court found was taken from The Wall Street Journal

17

was the ability to control, to have the exclusive

18

control over the information.

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and it seems to me

15
16

that probably it is.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I guess -- I mean,

17

it's sort of two -- two different kinds of responses.

18

One is that when you're asking if something is property,

19

you want to look at it sort of on a class-wide or

20

aggregate basis.

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's not the issue.

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

But I'm just saying you

3

want to look at something in the aggregate on a

4

class-wide basis, and persons doing their job on a

5

class-wide basis is something that is economically

6

valuable to them.

7
8

And therefore, it's property.

I lost track of what my second response was
going to be.

9

So anyway, the -- the Hobbs Act clearly was

10

targeted -- was trying to get at racketeering activity.

11

It was trying to get at organized crime families.

12

Congress knew that one of the main means that organized

13

crime families use was taking control of businesses.

And

14

Now, those cases might seem easier because

15

taking control of a brick and mortar business may seem

16

more obviously like property than taking control of a

17

person's occupation or their job.

18

to labor is economically valuable to them and is

19

property to them in the same way that the running of a

20

business is.

21

But a person's right

Now, Petitioner's view would -- if it -- I

22

mean, his real view is that he'd want to wipe out the

23

heartland of Hobbs Act organized crime prosecutions, but

24

I think his fallback position is that he would want to

25

wipe out any extortion of a business that provides

services instead of providing a tangible good.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm

Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't

charged in a much simpler way where the property is not

8

a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other

9

person can get, but where the property was the contract,

10

was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the

11

theory was that a threat was used in order to get that

12

investment and fees.

13

And why wasn't -- why isn't that just -- you

14

know, I look at the facts here and I say extortion, but

15

not on your theory, on my theory.

16

simple theory used?

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

18

several different theories, and one of the theories was

property that was obtained.

the fact that the State authorities did charge it under

18

think it's important to note, and Petitioner doesn't

6

clinics.

7

There were different types of property
One of them

This Court -- this Court distinguished that

8

from the other alleged property interests, which were

9

the running of the business that was the clinic.

And

10

the Court said that the right of women to access the

11

services of the clinics was really more of a liberty

12

interest and the running of a business was really more

13

of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't

14

have to decide that, but it said that's really more in

the nature of property.

right alleged.

17

That was the property

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me you

18

could characterize the right to work as more of a

liberty interest than a property interest.

20

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think it's both.

And

21

so someone -- the general counsel could have been

22

coerced in this case if he had been prevented from going

4

distinction between extorting someone not to go to work

5

and extorting him how to do his job once he's at work?

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

Not on the basis of

7

property, but on the basis of obtaining.

8

is -- there's no obtaining and in the latter there's

9

obtaining because what you're doing is you are

10

exercising the person's right to do their job.

11

The former

And the Court has said again and again that

12

exclusive control of property is an essential element of

13

all personal property, of all private property.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why, just as long as

15

we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C. 875,

"Whoever with intent to extort from any person," you

know, "anything of value"?

was -- I mean, there are five convictions under 875.

don't need to have a special definition of property to

there is no need to have a redundancy built in for that.

The fact

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A couple of points in rebuttal.
Ms. Harrington started by pointing to the

17

language in McNally.

18

at the same time that McNally got rid of the honest

19

services prosecution that was brought there, they

20

reserved two possible prosecutions.

21

obtaining of money, where there was a difference in what

22

the government paid for and what the government got.

23

And she is absolutely correct that

One would be the

The other thing that she alludes to is

24

there -- the Court did say, well, maybe there's a

25

possibility that you could prosecute based on the

1

government's loss of control over its allocation of

2

these workman's comp policies.

3

The problem is, of course, that McNally

4

precedes Cleveland.

5

seized on that language and said, well, even if the

6

video poker license isn't property, the right to control

7

who gets it is property, and that got exactly zero votes

8

from this Court.

9

viable.

And in Cleveland, the government

So I think that argument is no longer

10

Ms. Harrington also points to these New York

11

cases about the scope of property for purposes of 851 of

12

the New York Penal Code.

13

talking about is 850 of the New York Penal Code, the

14

kind of property that can be obtained.

15

common ground that -- they are not co-extensive.

16

are -- there is property that you can obtain that you

17

can't threaten.

18

But of course, what we're

I think it's
There

Indeed, the classic thing you obtained in --

19

in an extortion case is money, and I'm not sure how you

20

really threaten money.

21

from someone, but you don't really threaten the money.

22

So these are different terms.

23

You can threaten to take money

So relying on the Barondess case, which is

24

the same case that Justice Stevens relied on in dissent

25

in Scheidler II just doesn't work.
58

1

Now, she's also absolutely correct that

2

extortion at common law only involved official

3

extortion, but that doesn't mean that there aren't

4

common law places to look for a relevant definition of

5

property.

6

larceny statutes, the -- not statutes, the common law

7

crime of burglary, larceny, and embezzlement.

8
9

Because the same basic concept was in the

And indeed to this very day, New York refers
to extortion as larceny by extortion.

And if you go to

10

those New York cases, the place I would point you to is

11

the Ashworth case, which is cited in both of our briefs.

12

This is a case that makes very clear that under New York

13

law, they didn't even think that services at all were

14

property.

15

This is a case where the foreman of a mill

16

gets the bright idea that he's going to do some work for

17

his own company using the mill's facilities.

18

charged with larceny.

19

And he's

And the court in that case says, no, that's

20

not larceny, you didn't obtain any goods.

21

of common law property is in order to be the kind of

22

property that you can steal or extort it has to be

23

moveable.

3

the point, they say all of that and they reject that

4

argument.

5

captures what's going on here.

6

you can conceive of such a conception of property, but

7

they say to conceive this requires a certain

8

intellectual flexibility which is probably not possessed

9

by the average person.

And they use a line which I think really
They say, well, maybe

And I would simply submit it

10

also is not the kind of flexibility that should be

11

possessed by the average judge in a criminal case.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let -- look, I think if

13

we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what

14

you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's

15

Tropiano decision, and the large progeny of cases that

16

come from it.

17

The most common is the threat to a business

18

that says pull out of this market because we don't want

19

you in it.

20

routinely have said that is a Hobbs Act violation.

21

You're using the threat of force to tell people to keep

22

out of a particular market.

23

And we want all the customers.

And courts

Today you are telling us that under your

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, a couple of things,

2

Justice Sotomayor.

3

because it is sort of the pro genitor of this whole line

4

of Second Circuit cases, and I noticed two things.

5

I went back to the Tropiano case

One, I noticed it was written by a district

6

court sitting by designation.

mean anything by that other than this is not Marbury.

Second, I would say that the second thing I
noticed is that the debt --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, I think when I sat

11

12

that.

13

(Laughter.)

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it's not -- it's a good

15

thing you're no longer sitting in that capacity, Your

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

It's really is,

for you.
MR. CLEMENT:
mean you no offense.

-- because I -- I certainly

You could write Marbury here.

So the -- the difference is, Your Honor,

22

that that could have also been, I think, actually

23

prosecuted as a property crime because in that case,

24

there were customer accounts that were obtained, and

25

those customer accounts, as the facts of Tropiano
61
Alderson Reporting Company

1

discussed it, actually had value, they could have been

2

transferred from one business to another.

3

So I think what would happen in the Second

4

Circuit, if you decide this case the way we would like

5

you to, is the Government's going to have to be careful.

6

They're going to have to write their indictments to

7

focus on things like money or obtainable property, and

8

they can't get sloppy and put together these autonomy

9

interests and call them property.
