ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. WEBRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In Grable, this Court explained that

12

"arising under" jurisdiction demands, not only a

13

contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded

14

in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a

15

serious Federal interest in exercising Federal

16

jurisdiction over the State claim.

17

This Court should reverse the judgment below

18

because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a

19

substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal

20

jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims

21

like his, State legal malpractice claims would --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is whether

23

the experimental use -- whether that was a viable

24

theory.

25

mean by, "substantial"?

Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you

MS. WEBRE:

Well, Your Honor, defining

2

substantiality is a difficult point.

3

answer in two layers.

4

involve a legal question of does the -- how does the

5

experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what

6

are its parameters?

7

I -- I would

First, Mr. Minton's claim did not

The question was did his fact-bound and

8

situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence

9

of the application here in this particular case.

And it

10

is not a substantial question because, first, from a --

11

a unique case perspective, it involved merely a

12

hypothetical determination.

13

There were no actual patent rights that

14

would be at issue.

15

irrevocably determined in the underlying patent

16

litigation in Federal court.

17

Those were already fully, finally,

And, second, from a jurisprudence

18

standpoint, the -- the question of uniformity of patent

19

law, any decision by a State court, in Mr. Minton's

20

legal malpractice claim, would not be binding in any

21

way, on either the PTO in a patent application, or on

22

any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent

23

case.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you mean substantial

25

beyond the -- the -- this particular case?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. WEBRE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I -- I

2

think that that's where the Federal circuit's

3

jurisdictional -- the Federal circuit's "arising under"

4

jurisdiction standard, which the Supreme Court of Texas

5

applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that

6

the court improperly conflates the -- the question of

7

necessity of a Federal issue with the question of

8

whether that issue is substantial.

9

And, in the Grable case, this Court

10

emphasized that those are two separate issues.

11

are four prongs to the Grable test.

12

embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the

13

State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then

14

there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal

15

jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the

16

proper balance between State and Federal authority.

17

There

The Federal issue

The Grable court announced that, and then

18

just a year later, in the Empire HealthChoice case, Your

19

Honor -- Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for

20

the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of

21

"and here's how limited the Grable rule really is."

22

The Empire HealthChoice opinion

23

distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely

24

pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire

25

HealthChoice which were fact-bound and
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

situation-specific.

2

question of whether a State court is competent to apply

3

Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and

4

found that, yes, it was.

5

It distinguished the -- the

And the -- the Court emphasized that,

6

certainly, the State courts are going to be deciding the

7

occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not

8

make a Federal case out of each and every State tort

9

claim that might have an embedded Federal issue.

10

Now, in the earlier argument, there was some

11

discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of

12

different things in a lot of different contexts.

13

here, this Court has, on more than one occasion,

14

determined that jurisdiction -- "arising under"

15

jurisdiction means the same thing in 1331, the general

16

Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a),

17

the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable

18

specifically to patents.

19

Now, that has been amended slightly.

But,

It --

20

it, now, includes compulsory counterclaims where they

21

didn't used to be a part, but the jurisdictional grant

22

that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a)

23

uses the same exact phrase, the "arising under," "any

24

civil action arising under Federal law."

25

And, Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained

2

that the linguistic consistency between those two means

3

that they mean the same thing.

4

There is nothing unique about this subject

5

matter -- the patent subject matter, that changes the

6

scope of the jurisdictional grant.

7

the grant of original jurisdiction to the district

8

courts is exclusive, and that is different from the

9

general Federal question.

10

And to be --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

To be sure, the --

Well, why isn't that

12

significant?

13

that -- that -- that this is -- that this is a

14

complicated specialty area?

15

arguably, a special reason for having these cases, cases

16

that involve a patent issue, in Federal court, rather

17

than State court?

18

Doesn't that manifest Congress's view

MS. WEBRE:

And so there would be,

Yes, Your Honor.

But the --

19

Congress did that in a couple of different ways.

20

of all, I think it begs the question -- it begs the --

21

the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact

22

that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the

23

substantiality because, in order to get to exclusivity

24

of the jurisdiction, you have to get to jurisdiction

25

first.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

You have to -- it has to be "arising under"

2

an act of Congress relating to patents before it can

3

then be exclusive.

4

step.

5

than the general "arising under" standard.

So -- so we still have the first

But, also, Congress did not cast the net broader

6

Even under the -- the statutory framework

7

after the America Invents Act amendment -- under the

8

statutory structure, there are still a number of patent

9

issues -- legal issues that are going to be decided in

10

the State courts that do not come within the exclusive

11

jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

12

compulsory counterclaims, now, come within the exclusive

13

jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't.

14

For example,

Permissive counterclaims can certainly

15

present just as substantive a question of patent law,

16

and, yet, those are excluded under the statutory scheme

17

of 1338(a).

18

are not sufficient to support "arising under"

19

jurisdiction under 1338(a).

Patent issues raised as a defensive matter

So, certainly, Congress contemplated a

20
21

situation where some patent issues are just not going to

22

come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal

23

courts.

24
25

And I think it's interesting to -- to back
up a little bit and look at the Federal circuit's
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction.

2

In the early years of the Federal circuit, in 1984, the

3

first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the

4

court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is

5

cited at page 21 of the amicus brief filed by the

6

American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the

7

Federal circuit wrote, "Congress was not concerned that

8

an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit

9

court or of a State court would defeat its goal of

10
11

increased uniformity in the national law of patents."
And that was the view of the Federal

12

circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984.

13

evolved, the Federal circuit has changed its perception

14

of its own jurisdiction, and that's why we are here

15

today, is, in 2007, the Federal circuit went awry and --

16

and changed the standard that no longer follows what

17

this Court articulated in Grable.

18

But, in the time

They -- they have improperly conflated the

19

necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an

20

appropriate Grable analysis.

21

a proper balance of the State and Federal interests.

22

The Federal circuit announced that there's an interest

23

in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and

24

then that was that.

25

There is no balance if you don't look at the State

And they totally disregard

interest on the other side.
And, in legal malpractice cases, in general

3

and in Mr. Minton's claim in particular, there are

4

substantial State interests.

5

interest, the right of a State to develop its own State

6

claims, its own State law, and its own State courts.

7

There is the general

But there is also a State interest in

8

governing the relationship between attorney and client

9

that happens through the legal malpractice process.

10

But, specifically, with regard to Mr. Minton's claim,

11

one of his primary theories in -- in this case -- in the

12

legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error,

13

with regard to bringing up the Experimental Use

14

Doctrine, deprived him of the opportunity to make a

15

lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying

16

patent litigation.

17

Well, the question of exactly how you prove

18

whether and to what extent the NASD would have paid a

19

settlement and for how much in the underlying case is a

20

matter of tremendous dispute right now.

21

evolving issue in the -- in the legal malpractice

22

jurisprudence of the State of Texas.

23

That is an

In fact, in the month of December 2012, the

24

Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called

25

Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him

2

$100 million, if only these lawyers had raised this

3

issue earlier?

4

And, yet, if this -- if Mr. Minton's claims

5

are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound

6

and situation-specific application of the Experimental

7

Law Doctrine, the Federal courts would be Erie guessers

8

as to that important issue that the State courts really

9

need to resolve.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Ms. Webre, is there any

11

binding effect of a Federal determination here on State

12

law?

13

determination here on Federal law?

14

MS. WEBRE:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And is there any binding effect of any State

No, Your Honor.
If it was left to the

16

State, would what the States say about -- about patent

17

law be binding in any Federal cases?

18

if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything

19

that the Federal court says about -- about State tort

20

law be binding on State courts?

21

MS. WEBRE:

And, vice-versa,

In neither direction would any

22

decision be binding.

The -- the State -- any decision

23

in a State court on a legal malpractice matter regarding

24

issues of patent law would not be binding in any way on

25

the Federal courts or on the PTO in handling any of the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

patent applications -- prosecution of patents.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that -- that being

3

so, your -- your last argument about the Federal

4

government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an

5

area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in

6

the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that

7

doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this

8

single case.

9

I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas

10

law in that regard.

11

but --

12

They may get this case wrong,

MS. WEBRE:

You -- you are right that --

13

that it will not, substantially, adversely impact Texas

14

State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial

15

State interest.

16

And, in a way, it's akin to the issue in

17

Grable because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that

18

justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State

19

law claim and bringing it up into Federal courts wasn't

20

just that the issue was disputed, the -- the

21

construction of that statute was unresolved.

22

it needed resolving.

23

whose decision could be precedential, so then it's

24

resolved from then on.

25

But that

It needed resolving by a court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about the Federal

Doesn't that need resolving?

5

MS. WEBRE:

There are no Federal issues that

need resolving here because it's solely a question of

affidavit to the doctrine.

23

issue.

24
25

The question is the Federal

Is there a -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if -- if you say --

since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"substantial" Federal issue, then it's substantial in

2

hypothetical B, but not in hypothetical A?

3

MS. WEBRE:

Well, it's -- it's, perhaps,

4

more necessary.

5

back up a little bit and discuss what I think are the

6

factors for a court to look at, when deciding whether or

7

not an embedded Federal issue is a substantial one.

8
9

But -- and maybe what I need to do is

And looking at this -- this Court's
articulation in the Grable case and the Empire

10

HealthChoice case, the -- the issues that the Court

11

looked at -- one was the nature of the Federal -- of the

12

Federal question itself -- the Federal issue, is it a

13

constitutional issue?

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So does that mean that,

15

if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO

16

acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts --

17

how does that change your analysis?

18

MS. WEBRE:

That -- that would be a more

19

substantial Federal question than the one presented

20

here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to

21

warrant "arising under" jurisdiction here because it

22

is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of

23

patent rights.

24

legal malpractice case actually impacts any patent

25

rights.

No judgment that can happen in a State

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Let's say Mr. Minton won a judgment from a

2

State legal malpractice court saying, it was the

3

negligence, that you would have won the experimental use

4

exception, your patent would have been declared valid.

5

And so he has a judgment from a State court saying,

6

the -- the loss of your patent was the result of the

7

negligence and not because it was actually invalid.

8
9

That doesn't give him a valid patent.

He

cannot take that judgment and then sue somebody and say,

10

look, look, I've got a patent.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it's -So go back to -- you

12

were going through a list of questions, and I posited

13

let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a

14

constitutional question.

15

MS. WEBRE:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

Yes.

So -Then what other

factors --

18

MS. WEBRE:

Well, the -- the -- in the

19

continuum constitutional issues would be more

20

substantial; statutory issues would be a little less

21

substantial.

22

the Grable case and said, we're not going to draw a hard

23

and fast line on statutory issues.

24
25

In fact, this Court grappled with that in

But then, in the Empire HealthChoice
opinion, the Court noted that this is a -- the issue -­
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Federal issue there was nonstatutory, and so,

2

therefore, let's not make a Federal case out of it.

3

in that continuum, that would be one factor to look at.

4

So,

Another factor to look at would be, is the

5

Federal issue -- the legal issue undisputed or

6

uncertain?

7

particular facts to the legal issue because there really

8

isn't a Federal interest in how this affidavit is

9

construed or not.

Not necessarily the application of these

But, in -- in the resolution of the legal

10
11

issues, as in Grable, is the question of law disputed or

12

uncertain?

And the corollary to that is does it need

13

resolving?

Because that was the situation in the Grable

14

case.

15

16
17
18

But just because an issue is novel doesn't ipso

This Court, in the Merrell Dow case,

general rule that malpractice suits involving patent

23

rights can never, ever come under "Federal arising"

Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to

4

5

those cases, is always going to cut in your favor.

constitutional issue?

9

MS. WEBRE:

That they will never, ever

11

application of the Grable test to legal malpractice

12

cases.

13

And it's not that -JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

18

you're -- you're proving a negative.

19

In fact -- you know, I thought
It doesn't arise under, unless the
But once

The burden is on you to prove a negative,

20

that there is no situation that can arise in -- in

21

malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal

22

issue would justify arising under jurisdiction.

23

a hard road to hoe.

24
25

MS. WEBRE:

That's

I think there are two reasons --

there are two reasons why that's the only appropriate
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way to apply the Grable test to legal malpractice cases,

2

and both of them involve the lack of precedent from the

3

case.

4
5

One is it can never involve actual patent
rights.

6

The consequence of a judge's -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about fraud on -- a

7

claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on

8

the PTO?

9

Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent --

10
11

Lawyer loses that.

It's been litigated.

or might it not affect the patent in a patent action?
MS. WEBRE:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

12

It would not affect the patent office, either, as a

13

matter of res judicata or as a matter of issue

14

preclusion -- non-mutual issue preclusion or as a matter

15

of jurisprudential precedent, for a couple of reasons.

16

One is that, as a starting point, the -- the

17

question of attorney misconduct can affect the issuance

18

of a patent before the patent office, but that would

19

happen not in the context of a legal malpractice claim,

20

but in the context of the actual prosecution of the

21

patent before the PTO itself.

22

So the PTO would have made a -- its own

23

determination and granted or not granted limited

24

sanction, whatever action it is the PTO takes in --

25

before -- in a proceeding before itself, the PTO would
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be deciding that.

2

So a legal malpractice case would only be

3

subsequent to that.

4

the PTO gets to decide that.

5

So, in -- in the first instance,

From a res judicata standpoint, the PTO's

6

patent review manual -- the Manual of Examination of

7

Patents provides that res judicata effect is only given

8

to decisions by either the Board of Patent Review or

9

Interferences, the United States District Court for the

10

District of Columbia, and the Federal circuit.

11

courts make that list.

12

No State

So, from a res judicata standpoint, only

13

going right up the chain is going to bind the PTO.

14

from an issue preclusion standpoint, the PTO would never

15

be a party -- could never be a party to a -- a legal

16

malpractice claim and, therefore, would not be bound by

17

any State court decision.

18

And what's kind of a funny --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

And,

I find that somewhat

hard to follow.

21

Let's assume, in adjudicating a medical -- a

22

malpractice claim, the State court finds that the

23

attorney suppressed information.

fact.

You do not have

6

MS. WEBRE:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I would

7

take it a step further than that because I think that

8

any actual impact of -- of what you're positing, Justice

9

Sotomayor, is so ephemeral.

The idea that -- that the

10

PTO will look at a fact-finding in a legal malpractice

11

case, and, oh, goodness, I didn't realize there was this

12

suppression of evidence, I'm now going to dig further.

13

Well, that's such a speculative and

14

ephemeral possibility, it doesn't disrupt the fabric of

15

patent jurisprudence -- patent law, in any way, and it

16

doesn't tie the hands of the PTO in any way.

amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts?

5

It's just -MS. WEBRE:

6

Well, it -- it does a couple of

7

things.

First is it consumes a lot of time of the

8

courts and the litigants in removing and then getting

9

remanded again.

And it -- as is discussed in the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

What I -- yes.

11

12

jurisdiction.
MS. WEBRE:

13

What I

There are, on this issue of the

14

legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal

15

circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and

17

courts -- State and Federal courts have been grappling

18

with this precise jurisdictional issue.
I think this case is about the fifth or

sixth cert petition that came up to this Court on this

21

jurisdictional question.

lenient standard, as the Federal court has articulated?

of State law legal malpractice cases arising out of

5

patent representation is not going to overwhelm the

6

Federal court.

It's not going to -- to --

broader.

Let's say we resolve legal malpractice.

Then -- then we will have products liability with a

11

agriculture cases.

It goes on and on.

13

is a -- that's a substantial issue.

14

Justice Scalia said, that -- you know, the -- this Court

15

departed from Justice Holmes' construct some years ago.

16

But I think that there is the opportunity in this case

17

to provide a great deal of certainty, to provide

absolute certainty vis-à-vis legal malpractice cases

because of their unique hypothetical aspect.

issues -- immigration law may be a -- a differing area

where there is exclusive Federal court jurisdiction in

case, may give rise in that area.

case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but

5

also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless

6

to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the

7

issue, such a case cannot come within the "arising

MR. MICHEL:

No, I don't think anything that

But the A&T and the -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would find it

extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule.
MR. MICHEL:

Well, you can't isolate it.

14

That rule is more complicated because it is the

15

application of the Grable standard that's the analysis.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But getting back --

17

Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought,

18

that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that

19

there is exclusive jurisdiction.

20

pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because

21

it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other

22

areas of exclusive jurisdiction.

your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest.

that go into determining the -- one of the grounds that

has been articulated by Grable and the balancing for

to take that as guidance because their new taskmaster

will not be -- be following Federal patent law because,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Anytime -- anytime -- I

7

8

pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State

9

court litigations, contract litigations, every time you

10

have a patent question, then must the case go to the

11

Federal court, in your view?

12

MR. MICHEL:

No, that is not our position.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what is the dividing

14

line between patent questions that belong in State court

15

and patent questions that belong only in Federal court?

16

MR. MICHEL:

For example, not every

17

malpractice case -- it will be the case within the case

18

doctrine in a patent case that will go to Federal court.

19

For example, failure to communicate a

20

settlement offer does not have a case within the case.

21

In a business transaction, it doesn't have the case

22

within the case analysis.

23

So those malpractices arising from them will

24

not go to Federal court.

Breaches of fiduciary duty for

distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction

where the Federal law controls and patent is what?

What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law --

17

MR. MICHEL:

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- copyright law.

Why

19

don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same

20

way in those fields?

21

MR. MICHEL:

I think there are -- there are

22

distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other

23

area of the law namely because, as we get to the

24

State -- and this -- this goes to the analysis of the

25

State/Federal balance.

That's why the exclusive Federal
44

Alderson Reporting Company

1

court jurisdiction.

2

That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction

3

in patent law in the Federal circuit is different than

4

any other area of the law.

5

that we are required to engage in.

6

It is that balancing test

That's why it's unique from antitrust,

Those

They may not have an

14

concurrent.

Non-core are

Those can be heard in State court.
Secondly, those underlying issues in

So they are really applying whether

So rather than in any other area of law,

these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal

basically based on who the party is.

And they are still applying underlying

State issues.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your case turns on

3

the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate

4

jurisdiction?

5

MR. MICHEL:

That is one of the most

6

defining factors on the State/Federal balance of

7

judicial responsibility.

8

analysis of the federalism and, also, the articulation

9

of -- just as we have showed up -- Petitioners said a

10

Our understanding of that

whole ton of cases were going to come in.

11

We supported statistics that the numbers

12

will be very small.

13

because of the balancing test that we are required to --

14

But the distinguishing factor

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, if there's a large

15

Federal interest, I mean, that's what you're saying that

16

there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal

17

balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side.

18

If there is that large Federal interest, is

19

it surprising that the government hasn't come into this

20

case, if there's such a Federal interest to be

21

protected?

22

MR. MICHEL:

No, I think the Federal

23

government -- I can't -- I can't speculate to -- for

24

that, Justice Ginsburg.

25

reasons why they didn't come in on this case, just like

There could be just many

they don't come in on many other cases.

2

But the Federal interest here, in the

3

national uniformity, I think, has been well stated, both

4

by this Court and the Federal circuit.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's a difference

6

between you and your colleague on what "substantial"

7

means.

8

MR. MICHEL:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And she says it doesn't

10

just mean necessary -- essential in this particular

11

litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas

12

City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many

13

other cases, not just this case and whether there's

14

going to be issue preclusion as to this particular

15

inventor.

16
17

Those -- I don't see an issue in this case
comparable to those.

18

MR. MICHEL:

I think there are -- there are

19

a number of issues of -- of greater importance than just

20

this case.

21

Federal patent law on whether the experimental use

22

exception is a question of law or a question of fact.

23

The Federal circuit has gone both ways on

The question is the ongoing conflict in

24

that, whether the issue of buyer knowledge is a

25

conclusive factor or whether it is just one of 13
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

factors.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Whether they -- those

3

questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll

4

decide it, and then they'll be settled.

5

MR. MICHEL:

Well, we would hope they would

6

be settled, but, then, we're going to have this whole

7

other body of law out there in State courts that aren't

8

bound by the Federal court to answer those questions.

9

And those will govern the practice of patent -- patent

10

lawyers.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How likely is that, in

12

practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that

13

the State judges will go their own way?

MR. MICHEL:

16

I think it's a very real

We've had --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, my -- my experience

17

is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge,

18

are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of

19

patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision

20

of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast

21

as they can.

22

MR. MICHEL:

You -- you would -- you would

23

think so.

It doesn't appear to be the case because, in

24

this case, we had holdings that -- that experimental

25

testing had to be on a required claim element.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Webre, can I ask you

about the question presented?

6

The way you presented it to us, it -- it was

7

as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal

8

circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the

9

names of those opinions are.

10

But.

In fact, that's not

the situation at all.

11

The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable,

12

and I think just the way you would want it applied.

13

your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it

14

correctly; isn't that right?
MS. WEBRE:

15

I disagree, Your Honor.

So

The

16

Texas Supreme Court didn't properly apply Grable.

17

they applied was the Federal circuit's improper

18

departure from Grable, in two ways.

What

19

One is they conflated necessity with

20

substantiality, and that comes -- in the Federal

21

circuit's jurisprudence, that comes from a sound bite

22

from the earlier Christiansen case, where the -- the

23

line goes something like, "There is a substantial

24

Federal issue because it is necessary to the parties'

25

claim."
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And so it conflates necessity with

2

substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court

3

followed the Federal circuit's construct.

4

we're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality,

5

but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did.

6

They said,

And ditto with -- with the Federalism

7

balance.

They pointed to the needs of the Federal

8

interest in the uniformity of patent law, and that was

9

the end of the inquiry.

10

And I think that that is a measure of the

11

deference that the Supreme Court of Texas -- as other

12

State courts would do, the deference they grant to the

13

Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate

14

scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative

15

importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law.

16

And so we arrive to you from the Supreme

17

Court of Texas, but truly presenting the -- the

18

appropriateness of the Federal circuit's redone

19

application of the Grable test.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you answer the one

21

point your adversary raised that -- that gives me

22

pause -- a lot of pause.

23

He says a ruling on patent law of how you

24

should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim

25

will affect all of the lawyers who practice in – in

2

do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's

3

what the State is going to -- State courts will follow

in the future.

6

So it will change those lawyers' behaviors
in Federal court.

7

MS. WEBRE:

8

such a speculative road to go down.

9

lawyers are going to do different?

What is it the
A lawyer --

They are going to

11

But you can think of an

21

example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case,

22

but where a State court's ruling could, in fact,

23

establish a -- a code of behavior that's not just belts

24

and suspenders, that's something else.

25

MS. WEBRE:

Your Honor, I think that – that
52

spinning out a hypothetical on that would be truly

2

would be contrary or intentioned with what -- what the

6

7

law --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about just

the -- just the flip side of this case?

Let's suppose

10

11

it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor

12

suspenders.

So

That's going to affect the conduct of the

14

lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive

15

of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law.
