Mr. Boutrous.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. BOUTROUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted the Class Action Fairness

12

Act of 2005, CAFA, to expand Federal diversity

13

jurisdiction and to protect defendants and absent class

14

members against the kind of State court class action

15

abuses that are occurring in Miller County, Arkansas.

16

Congress directed that in calculating the amount in

17

controversy, "courts shall aggregate the claims of the

18

individual class members."

19

1332(d)(6), itâ€™s quoted in full at page 2 of our blue brief.

20

That's 28 U.S.C. Section

Congress's express focus on the claims of

21

the individual class members in the text of the statute,

22

rather than on the amount being sought by the would-be

23

class representative, is dispositive of the question

24

presented and requires reversal in this case.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Would your position

Official

1

be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but

2

rather the substantive claims?

3

different claims the class member -- the class could

4

raise.

5

other would yield damages of $10 million.

6

the same objection in a case in which the prospective

7

representative only pleads the first claim?

One would yield damages of $4,900,000.

8
9

Say there are two

MR. BOUTROUS:

The

Do you have

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

We are not arguing that here.

There are cases that this

10

Court has decided going back to Barry v. Edmunds in 1886

11

where there are allegations in a complaint that might,

12

for example, yield a punitive damage claim, but it's not

13

explicitly pled, and the courts then look and say,

14

punitive damages could be recovered here and say the

15

amount in controversy clearly exceeds the -- the

16

necessary amount.

17

But we're not saying that in every case the

18

courts need to look through and see every claim that

19

could be in play.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

Well, but you do

21

seem to have a difficulty with your position about how

22

far it goes.

23

the statute of limitations question.

24

it's not just how much they claim, but where they decide

25

to cut off the statute of limitations and so forth.

You make the point in your briefs about

4
Alderson Reporting Company

In other words,

Official

1

It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery

2

slope if you start saying we're going to look at what

3

the class could -- could recover in deciding whether or

4

not, not simply whether or not this representative is

5

adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above

6

or below $5 million.

7

MR. BOUTROUS:

That's really how it's been

8

done, Your Honor, from day one.

Under the traditional

9

diversity statute, the courts look and see what's the

10

maximum amount the plaintiff on his or her best day

11

could recover based on the factual allegations in the

12

complaint and the causes of action that could arise from

13

the factual allegations --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but under the

15

traditional -- you surely don't want us to apply the

16

rules of the traditional diversity statute to this case

17

because it's clear that under the traditional diversity

18

statute, you -- you can waive excessive damages, right?

19
20
21

23

MR. BOUTROUS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The individual -JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you don't want us to

apply that rule here.
MR. BOUTROUS:

I don't want you to apply

24

that rule, Your Honor, because that rule applies to the

25

individual who brings his own case in court and can say,

I want to come into court and collect less than the

2

amount that would give Federal jurisdiction.

3

different when Mr. Knowles has come to court and said, I

4

want to represent these other individuals in Arkansas.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's much

Well, why doesn't -- why

6

doesn't the normal class certification process protect

7

adequately the absent class members?

8

counsel has to prove he or she is adequate.

9

that mean that if they enter a stipulation that is

First of all,
So doesn't

10

grossly unfair to the class that the judge is not going

11

to certify that case?

12

MR. BOUTROUS:

It wouldn't protect it --

13

protect from the problems and abuses that Congress was

14

concerned about, Your Honor, and that are occurring

15

here.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You haven't answered.

17

If -- if the court finds the stipulation inadequate for

18

the class, is that class going to be certified?

19

MR. BOUTROUS:

It could be, Your Honor.

20

another class representative could come in and could

21

seek more than $5 million.

22

And

That's why --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And then they would get

23

removed to the Federal court, which is what the statute

24

was intended to do.

25

MR. BOUTROUS:

But what Congress was

2

Senate report make this very clear, that with all the

abuses that occur in the interim, discovery that has

5

back 10 years.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

at all, or the Plaintiffs who have claims greater than

13

those in the aggregate might opt -- will get notice and

14

opt out.

15

What I'm getting to is that if the

And there is due process challenges if a

16

settlement is entered that is so grossly unfair that it

17

violates due process.

18

itself doesn't protect the interests of -- of Congress.

19

So I don't know why the process

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor -- excuse me.

The

20

Congress was very concerned that cases were being kept

21

in the State courts through abuses and manipulations of

22

the amount in controversy.

23

Senate report, Congress talks about this because, for

24

example, in this case the defendants can never get a

25

class certification hearing in Miller County.

It's very clear in the

7

They can never get a ruling on the merits.

And in the meantime, the kind of abuses that Congress

3

was concerned about, the lack of the Rule 23 protection,

4

the application of those standards to protect the class

5

members --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Boutrous, you say what

7

Congress is concerned about and point to the Senate report.

8

You know, usually we look to the text and the text makes

9

very clear that Congress was concerned about many things

10

and it did many things.

It got -- it really -- it

11

raised the matter in controversy threshold.

12

eliminated the Zahn anti-aggregation rule.

eliminated the complete diversity requirement.

eliminated the one-year limit on removal.

Here's one thing it didn't eliminate.

didn't eliminate the St. Paul master of your complaint

So -- so I guess where in the text do you see

18

this?

You point to claim, the word "claim."

19

the only thing that you are resting on in the text?

20

MR. BOUTROUS:

Is that

Your Honor, I think the text

21

does take away the St. Paul rule that an individual can

22

control what he seeks and go where he desires and do

what he wants -- or she -- because it points to the

24

claims of the individual class members and the text

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if I said to you,

2

Mr. Boutrous, "Is your claim for over $100,000," what

3

would you think I mean?

4

sort of abstract version of the best claim you could

5

bring, or would you think I mean what I demanded, what I

6

asked for?

7

Would you think I mean some

MR. BOUTROUS:

Well, Your Honor, I would

8

think that I would answer you that it's worth as much as

9

I can possibly obtain in court if I was seeking to

10

adequately represent the class.

11

the claims here --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But in terms of valuing

Do you think that the word

13

"claim" is not -- when you say Joe made a claim for

14

$100,000, a claim is not what he asked for, but is

15

instead some kind of law professor's view of what the

16

best thing that he could have asked for?

17

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, we've cited the

18

Tohono O'odham Nation case, where the Court interpreted

19

the word "claim" and said when a statute uses the word

20

"claim" regarding claims that have not been brought,

21

it's the operative facts and the right to recovery, not

22

the demand.

23

That's exactly what we have here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Boutrous, I thought

24

at least as an alternative argument, you're saying:

25

statute itself is silent.

It doesn't deal with this
9

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

question of amount in controversy.

going to seek more than the $5 million, cannot speak for

6

However, the

He can't

I thought that was the central part of your

7

argument, not based on the statute itself, but on the

8

notion that a named plaintiff, unless and until he is --

9

he is certified to represent the class - doesn't

10

represent them.

11

He can represent himself, but he can't bind

12

the people who -- who have not been certified as part of

13

a class.

14

I thought that was part of your argument.
MR. BOUTROUS:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's

15

absolutely right.

the claims of the individual class members, Mr. Knowles

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- a named plaintiff

This is what I -- could you

go back --

21

MR. BOUTROUS:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- to Justice Kagan's first

23

question?

I was looking at the words of the statute.

24

And if I look at 1332, which has been on the books a

25

long time, it says, "The district court shall have
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the

2

matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of

3

$75,000, exclusive of interest, of costs, and" -- et

4

cetera, okay?

5

Then I look here, and it says, "The district

6

court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in

7

which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value

8

of $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs," et

9

cetera, okay?

So the words seem identical.

10

Now, in respect to the first, we know that a

11

lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't

12

care what this is about, I am not asking for more than

13

$75,000, and the Federal court does not have

14

jurisdiction.

15

and given that the second statute is almost identically

16

worded, at least in that part, why can't he do the same

17

thing with the $5 million?

Given that's true in the first statute,

18

And it can't be the words I quoted that

19

stopped him from doing it, so what is the word that

20

stops him from doing it?

21

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, it's the other

22

part that is extremely important, section 1332(d)(6).

23

You were quoting from section 1332(d)(2).

24

section 1332(a), Congress in CAFA explicitly added

25

subsection (6), which says "In any class action, the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Unlike

Official

1

claims of the individual class member shall be

2

aggregated to determine" --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, as to what that looks

4

like, "shall be aggregated," again from the language, is

5

it's simply to make certain that Zahn does not require

6

the individual -- thing to approach -- to count.

7

other words, you aggregate rather than just looking at

8

the individual members, which is Zahn, which has nothing

9

to do with the issue before us.
MR. BOUTROUS:

10

In

Well, Justice Breyer,

11

Congress could have said we're just getting rid of Zahn,

12

or it could have said the aggregate amount being sought

13

by the named plaintiff is going to control.

14

you took that away -JUSTICE BREYER:

15

But if

No, they rarely pass a

16

statute that says, let's just get rid of case X.

17

Normally they look to the holding of case X, and then

18

they pass the statute that says the opposite.

19

holding of Zahn was that you could not aggregate the

20

individual members' claims in a class.

21

Zahn, what we do is we pass a statute that says you can

22

aggregate.

23

So the

So to get rid of

And indeed, nobody objects here to the

24

aggregation.

It's the total amount of the claims being

25

limited by a stipulation that is the issue here, and
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's why I had trouble finding your argument in the

2

word "aggregation."

3

MR. BOUTROUS:

It's really not the word

4

"aggregation," Your Honor.

It's the word "individual"

5

and it's with the word "claims."

6

what you are suggesting, Justice Breyer, it could have

7

said the aggregate amount being sought by the named

8

plaintiff, or the total amount, or the demand of the

9

plaintiff.

If Congress had done

In the Venue Clarification Act, which was

10

passed in 2011, which applies to 1332(a), Congress said

11

the sum demanded will control.

12
13
14

But here, to protect the legitimate claims,
Congress defining, as I urged the Court -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Boutrous, that form of

15

argument -- Congress could have said -- does seem to me

16

to be much worse for your position.

17

wanted to get rid of the St. Paul master of your

18

complaint rule, it could have said, we are getting rid

19

of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule.

20

you're trying to find it in a provision which is really

21

an anti-Zahn provision, not an anti-St. Paul provision.

22

MR. BOUTROUS:

If Congress had

But

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let's get back to the Chief

5

Justice's question because there are a thousand ways in

6

which we let the named plaintiff prior to certification

7

construct a case, and then we ask, as Justice Sotomayor

8

said, later we ask, is the way he's constructed a case

9

adequate or not, and we allow him to go forward or not

10

based on that.

11

But he gets to decide whether to seek

12

damages.

13

14

bring, trespass or negligence.

16

defendants to sue.

17

He gets -- at all, or whether he only can seek

He gets to decide which

All of these things are going to have an

18

effect on -- on the amount that's -- that's being asked

19

for.

20

maybe you're telling me no -- do we stop the named

21

plaintiff from doing all -- all of those things, too?

22

And yet in all of these ways, we allow or --

MR. BOUTROUS:

We don't stop them from doing

23

all of those things, Your Honor.

And there are certain

24

things -- we -- we agree that the complaint controls a

25

great deal -- the factual allegations.
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about specifically

2

the question that the Chief asked about time?

3

argue in the district court that these plaintiffs could

4

have specified a 5-year time period, in which case it

5

would be clear that the amount in controversy was

6

satisfied.

7

You did

But instead, they took a 2-year period.
Can we take that also into account in

8

determining the amount in controversy, that the

9

complaint could have been enlarged to include 5 years

10

instead of 2 years?

11

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, I believe you

12

could.

13

said if there is a sign of manipulation that is meant to

14

thwart jurisdiction or affect jurisdiction, the Court

15

can look through that to look to competent proof of what

16

the actual facts are.

17

And I believe that the Court's decision in Hertz

And I think that what has happened here is

18

the plaintiff's lawyers, in addition to these

19

stipulations, they're slicing and dicing the classes up

20

into pieces to -- to thwart jurisdiction and manipulate

21

jurisdiction.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your approach leads

23

to particularly perverse results.

24

position of arguing that -- you know, they are seeking

25

less than $5 million, but we're responsible for a lot

MR. BOUTROUS:

Could -- I assume that

It's an unusual position to

7

be in, Your Honor, it's not quite what we're arguing.

8

We're arguing that under the rules for judging the

9

amount in controversy that this Court has enforced, the

10

lower courts have enforced these for hundreds of years,

11

and it's that you look at the complaint and say what's

12

the maximum amount the plaintiff can get on their best

day under the claims they've pled based on the facts and

14

the proof and the evidence.

seniority.

Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there a difference

3

between what you are advocating and the approach that's

4

now taken in the General Removal Statute as it's been

5

amended recently under 1446(c)(2)?

6

it, the amount demanded in the complaint is not

7

necessarily controlling.

8
9

So there as I read

A case can be removed even if the amount
demanded in the complaint is below the jurisdictional

10

threshold and then the defendant can prove that the real

11

amount involved exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.

12

MR. BOUTROUS:

That's -- that's exactly

13

right, Your Honor.

14

because under 1332(a) and 1446, there are certain

15

standards that need to be met to allow the defendant to

16

put on proof.

17

defendant can then put on evidence and say this is the

18

actual amount in controversy.

19

There's greater leeway under CAFA

But that's how it's always been.

The

And here, the only way the plaintiff got

20

around it in the lower courts was to argue that the

21

stipulation was binding, Justice Kagan, that was their

22

argument below and that's what the district court found.

23

It found that the stipulation was binding on the class.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's binding if the class is

certified and a case proceeds to judgment.
18
Alderson Reporting Company

It's not

Official

1

binding on the absent class members prior to

2

certification and prior to judgment.

3

MR. BOUTROUS:

And that means that

4

jurisdiction in the Federal courts exists because we

5

judge jurisdiction at the time of removal.

6

time of removal, there was no binding limitation on the

7

recovery that could be obtained, undisputed facts showed

8

that that exceeds $5 million when the claims of the

9

individual class members are aggregated.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

And at the

I think I don't understand

11

that, Mr. Boutrous, because what you have, given that

12

this is a State which says that these stipulations are

13

binding if it proceeds, if there's certification, and if

14

it proceeds to judgment, you have a cap of $5 million.

15

You cannot be charged more than $5 million under this

16

State's law, if this case ever gets to judgment.

17

MR. BOUTROUS:

The problem, Your Honor,

18

again and this isn't just me.

This is what Congress

19

said in its findings.

20

it eliminated the -- but the five pillars of

21

restrictions and diversity jurisdiction because in State

22

courts, the courts aren't applying Rule 23-like

23

standards.

In -- in the text as you noted,

They're not doing it in Miller County.

24

They're not even allowing class

25

certification to occur or to be heard, and instead this

Even if this case were

absent class members would ever be able to -- to

determine whether by failing to opt out, they had

10

compromised part of their claim.

11

if they're notified that there's a $5 million cap -- and

12

I don't know that Rule 23 requires that, but suppose

13

they're notified of that.

I don't see how, even

They can't tell whether, by remaining a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your concern is that

24

the -- that the certification -- if the certification

25

would occur in the Federal court, that's one thing.
20

But

Official

1

you're -- you're saying that the named plaintiff can't

2

stand for the entire class when we know that -- that the

3

certification question, if the stipulation is binding to

4

prevent removal, it's going to be the State court that's

5

going to look into the adequacy of representation and

6

whether the stipulation binds all members of the class.

7

That's your whole concern.

If the -- if the

8

Federal court made that determination, I think you

9

wouldn't be here.

10

MR. BOUTROUS:

11

was concerned about, too, Your Honor.

12

that the State courts weren't applying standards of

13

uniformity in these -- class actions that are affecting

14

interstate commerce and that Rule 23's protections and

15

standards should apply.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. BOUTROUS:

Now, usually we don't
Why should

removal issues and the amount in controversy at the time

10

the line there.

11

the notices to the absent class members, Congress -- I

those are the findings that Congress put into the public

legitimate rights in -- and enforcing their legitimate

claims.

And as Justice Alito was pointing out,

Confusing notices are

And it would be ironic in the extreme

19

if a -- where a statute was enacted to protect -- and

20

this is in the findings -- "legitimate claims of absent

class members" and to allow them -- the cases to be in

22

Federal court, if this Court were to hold that a named

plaintiff who doesn't represent those people can come

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you're

assuming that it's a bad thing for the class members to

have their claims limited.

8

them into what would reasonably be regarded as a more

9

sympathetic forum.

to just the pure analysis, the question is does the

undisputed that that's true.

18

it doesn't exceed that amount is the stipulation, which

effect and -- and you have not been exposed to more than

$5 million.

6

If the -- the named plaintiff is found

MR. BOUTROUS:

But the question, Your Honor,

7

is, is it binding in this case on anybody or anything

8

other than Mr. Knowles?

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's binding -- it is

10

binding on everybody if there's a finding of adequate

11

representation and if this goes forward as a class

12

action; then it's binding and you haven't been exposed.

13

MR. BOUTROUS:

But, Your Honor, again, under

14

the jurisdictional approach -- and Your Honor cited

15

St. Paul.

16

controversy has been established to exceed the amount,

17

here $5 million, it's on the burden of the parties

18

seeking to oust jurisdiction to show, to a legal

19

certainty, that the amount will not go over $5 million.

20

St. Paul says that if -- once the amount in

Your questions and the plaintiff's brief

21

concede it could well go over $5 million if this class

22

representative is found inadequate, if another person is

appointed to be the class representative, and therefore,

there is Federal jurisdiction.

plaintiffs say should apply.

That's the rule that

problem.

meant to just keep the case in State court, contrary to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do -- in the

definition of the proposed class, the proposed class,

11

and that's what we have here.

12

MR. BOUTROUS:

That's -- that's what we're

13

using, Your Honor, for our calculations, the proposed

14

class, including the narrower time frame that we think

15

is a manipulation, but nevertheless we've used that and

16

the amount exceeds $5 million.

class representative.

12

So, if the class is later not

If the class is certified --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you -- are you saying

that (6) doesn't apply at this point?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because (6) talks about

15

class action, and it says the duty of the district

16

court --

17

MR. FREDERICK:

What --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- is to aggregate the

19

claims of the individual class members.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

And what 1332(d)(1)(B) does,

21

Justice Kennedy, is define class action in terms of the

22

civil action that was filed, so long as it was filed

23

pursuant to Federal Rule 23 or an equivalent State

24

statute.

25

What the complaint here does in the prayer
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for relief, and in paragraph 11 of the complaint, is to

2

say that this civil action is not going to be worth more

3

than $5 million.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you -- I assume

5

you agree that if at the adequacy hearing, if there ever

6

is one, and it's demonstrated that well, in fact, the

7

amount in controversy is $10 million, then you would be

8

obviously not an adequate representative.

9

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, that would be one

10

outcome that a State court could come to.

11

outcome could be that at that point, if an alternate

12

class member comes in and files an intervened complaint

13

and says, this case really is worth $10 million, at that

14

point section 1453(b) applies and they can remove to

15

Federal court.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

A second

And they can remove no

17

matter when that happens; is that right, as a result of

18

CAFA, because CAFA took off the one year limit?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or the State court could

21

find, oh yes, it is -- the claim is worth a lot more

22

than 5 million, but it's worth that amount to be in this

23

generous court for these generous juries.

24

really not harming these absent plaintiffs because they

25

ought to want to be here.

And so you're

We've got juries and very
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

favorable judges.

2

Couldn't it find that?

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, what's very clear,

3

Justice Scalia, is that Congress was not attempting to

4

address the adequacy of class representation issue when

5

it decided this statute and enacted it.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand it, but -- but

7

I'm just addressing your point which you blithely say,

8

if the -- if the representation is inadequate, if indeed

9

it's worth a lot more, that will be handled.

Not

10

necessarily.

11

this State court would find, that it's worth the money

12

to be in State court.

13

The State court could find, and I suspect

MR. FREDERICK:

A putative class

14

representative makes all kinds of strategic judgments

15

about how best to maximize value for his clients and for

16

the class.

17

assert various legal theories.

18

Mr. Chief Justice, this goes to your very first

19

question, this complaint renounced a claim for punitive

20

damages.

21

And that entails judgments about whether to
Here, and

But there are some cases out of the Tenth

22

Circuit, the Frederick case, not associated with me, and

23

in the Seventh Circuit, the Back Doctors case, they say

24

essentially if there is a claim for punitive damages you

25

have to make an estimate for amount in controversy
28
Alderson Reporting Company

purposes.

2

As I understand their theory in -- as they

3

express it on page 11 of the reply brief, it's very

4

uncertain as to a case like ours where we have renounced

5

a claim to punitive damages whether or not a Federal

6

district court is, nonetheless, supposed to take that

7

into account.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you had a

case where a lawyer brings an action in Miller County

11

of people with these claims and these claims, whose

12

names begin with A to K.

19

In each of those

I take it you don't have any

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, my objection would be

20

at the class certification stage, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

where the requisite of typicality, numerosity, the

22

contrivances that are being done are -- are going to

23

whether or not those represent -- representatives are

24

adequate.

strategy is perfectly appropriate under the master of

the complaint --

14

I think that for Federal jurisdiction

JUSTICE BREYER:

If so, this is just a

15

loophole because it swallows up all of Congress's

16

statute, which is what their problem is, all you have to

17

do, even if you were less obvious than the Chief

18

Justice's example, what you do is you -- you file a

19

complaint, you say it's for $4,900,000; in fact, it's

20

worth 10 million.

21

Justice Alito, you figure a way around his problem, you

22

keep them informed, and you say, it's getting close,

23

getting close.

24
25

that is required is a few extra pieces of paper that

will soon become standardized, and a lot of postage

stamps.

And if it's for 50 million, then you
So, in fact, all

And we have 30 or 40 or $50 million cases
being tried in whatever counties Congress liked the

10

least.

11

seems to be all behind Justice Scalia's and the Chief

12

Justice's questions, and I would like to hear a pretty

13

complete answer on that.

14

I gather they're some in Arkansas.

MR. FREDERICK:

Sure.

But that

Justice Breyer, if

15

you look at the report that went along with the statute,

16

what Congress was most concerned about was the situation

17

where each individual class member would not be able to

18

exceed $75,000, but there might be a million of them.

19

And so you might have a million class members, each of

20

whom had a claim for $50,000, and there was no way to

21

get that to Federal court because of the Zahn

22

non-aggregating rule.

23

Congress was not concerned about having the

24

master of the complaint altered in this class process;

25

and, in fact, Congress rejected a proposal that would
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lower the amount in controversy for class actions to $2

2

million because the congressional budget office said, if

3

you keep it at that low, virtually every class action

4

will be in Federal court and Congress has not

5

appropriated additional funds for the Federal courts to

6

deal with all of the class actions that would occupy

7

this space.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you

9

realize, of course, you are on pretty thin ice.

You are

10

talking about a Senate Report and now you are talking

11

about proposals that weren't enacted.

12

friend on the other side focuses on the statutory

13

language which tells you how to find out how much is at

14

stake.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Your -- your

And I'm telling you that his

16

focus on the word "claims" is insufficient because there

17

are no claims by absent members until there is a civil

18

action that has been filed.

19

at the definition of a class action, it is a civil

20

action that is filed pursuant to one of those rules.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that is why if you look

Under your argument, the

22

amount that's demanded seems to be totally meaningless.

23

Here, we are told that the real amount is only slightly

24

above the $5 million figure, but I don't think that

25

makes any difference.

So let's say that what was -- you
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

stipulate you are not going to get more than $5 million,

2

but really the value of the claim is $50 million.

3

And you say that's perfectly okay.

It will

4

be dealt with later when the case is -- after the case

5

has been remanded to the -- to the State courts.

6

that right?

7

nothing.

Isn't

So the $5 million is just -- just means

8

MR. FREDERICK:

No, the 5 million --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

In practical terms.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Alito, it

11

means we have to determine, and the district court has

12

to determine, whether or not the 5 million has been

13

satisfied on the basis of the well pleaded complaint and

14

an aggregation where, as a factual matter and as a

15

stipulated matter in paragraph 11 of the complaint, the

16

class representative here said, this case is not worth

17

more than $5 million.

18

And we know that that's true because even

19

under their estimate of all of the class members in the

20

State of Arkansas, the damages only equal about

21

$3 million.

22

And so -JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

But does that matter?

23

We assume, I think, that the real amount is a little bit

24

over $5 million.

25

or 7 million, 8 million, does it matter where along that

Suppose the real amount is 6 million

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

continuum the real amount falls?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

Not so long as there is a

3

binding stipulation that says so long as this civil

4

action is in place, it is not going to be worth

5

$5 million.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what you said then in

7

response -- we're on the same subject, and I'm drawing

8

the conclusion from what you say that yes, we've found a

9

way around this.

And what we're going to do is we will

10

divide our $25 million class action into six subsidiary

11

actions and proceed exactly the same merry way.

12

do that by means of stipulation.

13

And we

Now, your words in the statute do favor

14

that, in my opinion, at the moment.

15

seems to strongly cut the other way.

16

to go the other way, in that you could say, given the

17

purpose of this, the words do mean something different,

18

and they do mean you should aggregate the real value of

19

the real amounts that the class is likely to have.

20

But the purpose
And I do see a way

Now, it's capable of that reading, and the

21

virtue of that reading is that it would stop what looks

22

like, from what you're saying, a mechanical method of

23

avoiding the purpose of the statute.

24

explicitly because I really want to make it as much as

25

possible that you will focus in on what's a response to

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Breyer,

3

Congress could have addressed any number of those kinds

4

of issues with the specific terms that it used, but the

5

well-pleaded complaint rule and the master of the

complaint rule is a very subtle part of our diversity

9

And that is so because we want these

Under their approach, they would take all

10

the conceivable legal theories that might be brought

11

over a -- conceivable period of time, and ask the

12

district court to make very nuanced judgments about --

13

what --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what you're saying in

15

your answer to Justice Breyer -- and I don't think

16

you've really addressed his point -- that the statute

17

number 6 says "shall aggregate the individual claim."

18

What you're saying is that the simplest thing is to

19

evade the statute.

20

we still use that approach because the simplest is the

21

best.

Evasion is simple.

And therefore,

22

That just is not responsive to his question.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Kennedy, let

24

me try it this way, which is that for the large case,

amount in controversy is debatable as to whether it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Court finds at the certification stage that the

But we have to judge removal at the time

faith in stipulating to a lower amount than

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose this were an

2

individual action, and the amount is -- the amount is

3

pled -- an individual diversity action -- and the amount

4

that is pled is under $75,000.

5

remove the case and prove that the amount is really

6

higher than that because the practice of the State in

7

question is to allow a recovery that is over $75,000.

8

So why shouldn't the same approach apply here?

9

MR. FREDERICK:

The defendant still can

Well, you were referring to

10

a statute, Justice Alito, that was recently enacted, in

11

which it does say that the presumption shall be that the

12

amount pleaded in the complaint is subject to disproval.

13

But that's reversing 200 -- well, 100-plus years of

14

settled removal law, after the reforms of the 1870s

15

created the removal jurisdiction the way it is more

16

currently constructed.

17

And so in that interregnum between the 1870s

18

and that statute passed just a couple of years ago, the

19

rule was well-settled that the individual case pleading

20

amount was fine.

21

was a stipulation that had been filed contemporaneously

22

with the complaint or prior to removal, that that would

23

be given legal effect.

24
25

And under St. Paul Mercury, if there

Here, the stipulation was filed with the
complaint.

There is no doubt that this was done in good
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

faith.

The district court found that -- and I don't

2

think that's really an even arguable proposition here,

3

where they were asserting a 40 percent attorney's fee on

4

this -- and so really the question is, where you have an

5

aggregated estimate, should that be given legal effect.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wouldn't it be perverse if

7

the rule were that in an individual action where a

8

plaintiff is simply stipulating how much he or she is

9

demanding -- individually -- which the person can do,

10

it's possible to look behind that number.

11

But in a class action where the named

12

Plaintiff is purporting to make a stipulation on behalf

13

of absent class members as to whom the named plaintiff

14

at that point has absolutely no authority, you can't

15

look behind the number --

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, as a policy matter, we

17

might have a debate about the various virtues of that,

18

but they were not enacted in the same piece of

19

legislation.

20

So what we do know is that for CAFA,

21

Congress had not adopted the rule that you're positing.

22

Nonetheless, we do not attempt to argue that they have

23

no basis for making arguments about amount of

24

controversy when they remove, but it is subject to the

25

rule that a binding stipulation shall be given binding
39

effect in the civil action that has been filed.

2

that is later proved to be inadequate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if

How is it binding when

4

you said in your brief it doesn't bind the unnamed class

5

members?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Ginsburg, this is

7

important that you and I understand each other on this

8

point because it is binding in the civil action filed

9

for all purposes.

So whoever is covered by that civil

10

action will forever be bound by the $5 million

11

stipulation.

12

What we do not know is who will be members

13

of that class until the certification hearing is done.

14

Whoever ends up being covered by that civil action will

15

forever be bound by that stipulation.

16

district court knows.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That is what the

Can I ask you this?

Because

18

I have been trying to figure out exactly what

19

Mr. Boutrous is concerned about.

20

be concerned about is that, notwithstanding that the

21

class has really claims for $20 million, the thing is

22

going to be certified for $5 million, and all these

23

absent class members are -- are being deprived of

24

something meaningful to them.

25

And one thing he might

But that's something which -- you know
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

usually, we assume that State court judges will do their

2

jobs, will pay attention to the Constitution, will apply

3

adequacy of representation standards that come from the

4

due process clause.

5

to worry about in interpreting this Federal statute.

6

So that seems like a strange thing

The other possibility is that he might be

7

worried that this stipulation won't be really as binding

8

as you say, that in a case in which there is an adequacy

9

of representation determination made, the class goes

10

forward, and then things work out and it really looks

11

like all these absent class members are going to get --

12

you know, badly treated.

13

He's going to tear this stipulation up or do

14

something like that.

15

line.

16

And it's going to be way down the

And why should we allow that to happen?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, for two reasons,

17

because there are protections that are in the statute

18

that protect both defendants and absent class members.

19

And the protection for the absent class members is it

20

that if that stipulation is insufficient to adequately

21

represent their interests, the district court, the trial

22

court and State court will not certify the class.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But this is -- he's done the

24

certification, now it turns out that the certification

25

was wrong, that in fact, these claims are worth a good
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deal more.

2

these people's claims to be adjudicated for this amount

3

of money when I know they're worth five times as much.

4

And he says, I can't in good faith allow all

MR. FREDERICK:

And -- and as a matter of

5

judicial estoppel, what is absolutely clear in every

6

State that I am familiar with is that it follows this

7

Court's basic formula in New Hampshire v. Maine, which

8

looks at whether or not a change in position would

9

prejudice the interests of the other party if the Court

10

had relied on the original position of the litigant, and

11

that will estop that person.

12

Now, it may -- it may well be that there are

13

due process issues associated with class representative

14

and the adequacy of a class representative is a

15

continuing concern throughout a litigation precisely

16

because of due process concerns.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Another thing he

18

might be worried about is that if this action is

19

allowed to proceed, although on its face it's worth

20

$4 million, they're going to have to make a

21

determination whether to settle for a particular amount

22

or not.

23

And if they make a determination that

24

they've got to settle for whatever it is, 20 -- you

25

know, $20 per class member, that is going to set the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limit for other classes, including the class members who

2

opt out of this action, the class members from Missouri.

3

And the point is that, for a variety of

4

reasons, that this gives extraordinary leverage to the

5

individual class representative of a sort that --

6

precisely the sort that Congress was worried about.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Actually, I think

8

Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect, the economic

9

incentives are completely reversed because if a class

10

representative is bound by a stipulation that this case

11

is not worth than $5 million, the bidding starts at 5

12

million, but it goes down, it doesn't go north because

13

the defendant knows that no matter whether we go to

14

trial or not, this case, this case -- this civil action

15

is only going to be worth $5 million.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's going to be

17

worth a lot more because, if you go to trial, you're

18

going to have a judgment that they should have been

19

giving the general contractor whatever --

20

MR. FREDERICK:

GCOP.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- pickup it is in

22

every case.

23

valuable.

24

downside, it's going to be a lot more than $5 million.

25

And so that is going to be extremely
It's going to be worth a lot more -- but the

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, certainly,
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Chief Justice, Congress could have drafted a statute

2

that allowed for the removal of every State class action

3

and dealt with that issue if it was deemed appropriate

4

to have Federal courts decide all class actions, but

5

that wasn't the statute that Congress enacted.

6

Congress also could have expressed concerns and

7

difficulty with this idea of having the Master of the

8

Complaint Rule applied in the class action context, but

9

it didn't address that either.

10

And

And so when Congress is only addressing a

11

very narrow problem of dealing with the non-aggregation

12

principle so that class actions that were worth more

13

than $5 million would be allowed to be removed to

14

Federal court, I don't think it would be appropriate for

15

the Court to try to infer a larger set of --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

difficult -- one reason, it's very difficult to

18

speculate about Congress, what they speculate about what

19

they would have intended.

20

thought about the idea that there will be class actions

21

worth a lot more than $5 million, but the plaintiff's

22

lawyer will only ask for less than $5 million.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

It's very

Presumably, they may not have

Well, these kinds of

24

stipulations are well known and in fact, as we quote on,

25

I think it's page 5 of our brief, Congress was aware of
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

factual stipulations.

2

that it's perfectly fine for their to be a joint

3

stipulation between the putative class representative

4

and the defendants.

5

They concede in their reply brief

And, yet, I would think that that would

6

raise even more problems and concerns by you because

7

that would lead to the kind of collusion between a

8

putative class representative and the defendant without

9

knowing what the other interests of the absent class

10
11

members are.
And so here, where a good faith effort is

12

made to quantify the aggregate claims and that good

13

faith effort leads to the stipulation that the case will

14

not be worth more than $5 million, the interests of

15

jurisdictional simplicity, the interest of fairness to

16

the class members, the interest of understanding what

17

the civil action is all about so that the defendant is

18

on notice about what will be claimed in this civil

19

action are all things that should be given respect.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about -- what about,

21

has anyone thought of this -- I hate to bring up sort of

22

a new idea, but somebody may have thought of it.

23

Imagine we're now in the Federal district court.

24

the Federal district court reads the statute because the

25

case has just been removed.

And

And he says -- you know,

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this -- this case would be worth a lot more than 5

2

million were it not for that stipulation.

3

And let now me look at that stipulation.

4

That stipulation is a part of some, let's call it,

5

"monkey business," which you will resist that, but I

6

mean by that to -- to encompass the kinds of things

7

we've been talking about, that there are going to be

8

five similar class actions, that they're going to take

9

the people A through K, that they're going to --

10

anything like that.

11

And he says that's not under this statute

12

the kind of stipulation that Congress meant to bar my

13

consideration of the $5 million.

14

manipulative stipulation, whatever that might be, it

15

doesn't bar me as the district judge from aggregating up

16

to -- beyond 5 million, but if it's not manipulative,

17

fine.

18

kind of --

So if it's a

Has there -- has there been any thought on that

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, there are two tools

20

that -- that we describe in our brief and that I think

21

are reasonable ways that Federal courts address these

22

matters.

23

Rule 11 and there are -- there's a frivolous assertion

24

of a stipulation, which Federal district judges deal

25

with Rule 11 motions all the time.

One is to look at whether or not it violates

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The second is the concept of good faith,

2

which is what St. Paul Mercury addressed when it said

3

that a stipulation for less than the jurisdictional

4

amount, if made in good faith, is something that will be

5

treated as dispositive for jurisdictional purposes.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Breyer's

7

hypothetical would not come up on your theory because

8

the Federal court would never get the chance to make

9

that determination.

10
11

It would be made in the State

court.
MR. FREDERICK:

No.

If I'm understanding

12

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, it's at the amount of

13

controversy stage and so there is litigation at that

14

stage and the defendant presumably would bring to the

15

judge's attention, I think this is being done in bad

16

faith and I have these arguments for why this is

17

deceiting -- deceitful, misleading, et cetera.

18
19
20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So would that include the

I'm suing for two years when I could have sued for five?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, I don't think so because

21

there are lots of tactical reasons why litigants might

22

want to limit their claims or might have a good faith

23

basis for saying, I've only investigated this time

24

period, I do not have a good faith basis for asserting

25

claims in a different time period that I have not
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

investigated that does not serve the court.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but there might be --

3

there might be ways of working with this notion, a

4

little risky from your point of view, but there might be

5

ways of working with this good faith notion so that

6

some -- there would be some power in the Federal

7

district court to set aside certain stipulations which

8

were used for manipulative purposes and what the definition

9

of that manipulative is something that isn't clear to -- to

10
11

me at the moment.

But --

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the -- the -- the

12

notion that I have distilled from St. Paul Mercury and

13

the idea of good faith and looking at cases that have

14

addressed bad faith, which is obviously the converse of

15

good faith, is whether or not there is something

16

misleading or deceitful in the way that this stipulation

17

would be framed.

18

guidance as I can give you absent briefing.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I think that that is as good a

But it would never

20

involve a judgment that a claim is really worth

21

$50 million and just to defeat this statute, it's being

22

limited to 5.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

There -- there could be a

24

strategic reason, Justice Sotomayor, why --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the only strategic

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason according to your adversary is they want to stay

2

in State court.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, but there are reasons

4

because, in Arkansas, for instance, there is a direct

5

appeal for the State supreme court.

6

this case in many fewer years than it would take to wind

7

its way up through the Eighth Circuit and up to this

8

Court.

9

We could finish

That is one salutary reason.
The second is we're talking about State law

10

claims that are breach of contract claims for a

11

State-regulated industry.

12

would be looking at how State insurance is done here.

13

So there are very good reasons why a -- why a lawyer

14

would want this case to be in State court and not want

15

it to be removed to Federal court wholly apart from the

16

ad hominem attacks that they make about Miller County,

17

which were not brought to Congress's attention and in

18

fact are false.

Mr. Frederick, your

3

answer just doesn't deal with the component that's been

class members.

really know how much the entire quantity of the class

might truly be, and who's protecting them --

that's true under Federal rules, too.

applying Federal Rule 23 and you have a large number of

15

class members and the case gets settled for X dollars,

16

the individual class member is held to the duty of

17

deciding whether to opt out because that individual

18

class member thinks I may have been able to get more

19

than what is being offered in this class settlement or

to attack the adequacy of the representation because the
