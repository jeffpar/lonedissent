ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DABNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Article III question in this case turns

12

on resolution of two issues:

13

freedom to operate on the part of a direct competitor

14

qualifies as Article III injury in fact; and, second,

15

what party bears the burden of proof of facts that are

16

contended by it to render a claim moot.

17

First, whether loss of

The counterclaim in this case seeks to

18

extinguish a source of cost, risk, and official

19

restraint on what footwear products the Petitioner can

20

and cannot legally sell.

21

injury in fact.

22

These are classic forms of

On the burden of proof point, the proponent

23

of a factual contention always bears the burden of

24

proving this, and this is especially true when the

25

question arises in the context of a claim that a
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

voluntary act has allegedly ousted a Federal court of

2

jurisdiction.

3

Mootness doctrine protects a party seeking

4

relief from the kind of evasive maneuvering that's

5

happened in this case.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if I were to write

7

an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here

8

because distributors and retailers will see that there's

9

been this suit against the -- your client and they will

10

be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just

11

make that up?

12

out -- to find that out, or --

13
14
15

Or is there something I can read to find

MR. DABNEY:

Injury in fact is a question of

fact, and injury in fact is based on evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the -- the evidence

16

here was that they did need investors, and investors

17

were reluctant.

18

MR. DABNEY:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

That's correct.
It wasn't specific

evidence, but then I -- anything besides that?
MR. DABNEY:

There are three forms of injury

22

in this case.

The first is that the Petitioner's cost

23

of operation is increased because the disputed claim was

24

not expunged.

25

products, it has to go through an incredibly costly

When the Petitioner designs and sells new

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

process to determine whether or not its next line of

2

shoes might give rise to a plausible claim --

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

Is that -- is that

in the record?

5

MR. DABNEY:

It certainly is.

The

6

Petitioner says, through its president, on page 173 of

7

the Joint Appendix, that he's engaged in new --

8

development of new shoe lines, which by definition are

9

outside the scope of the covenant document.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

When you said it's

11

incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in

12

the record?

13
14
15

MR. DABNEY:

That specific statement is not

in the record.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, it makes sense,

16

but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice

17

of the shoe business.

18

I mean --

MR. DABNEY:

Your Honor, I'm glad you

19

brought that up because, under the mootness doctrine,

20

the burden of proof on that and every other fact

21

relevant to mootness fell on the Respondent.

22

Court's precedents, the Respondent in this case, in

23

order to oust the district court of jurisdiction, had to

24

show two things to a high degree of probability.

25

first thing the Respondent had to show is that it was
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Under this

The

Official

1

absolutely clear that the Petitioner could not

2

reasonably be expected --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're right, that's the

4

standard.

And so you said that -- I mean, I feel

5

perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is

6

warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything

7

here that you -- so you said, by definition, we're going

8

to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do

9

not have the appearance of any current and/or previous

10

footwear product designs and any colorable imitations

11

thereof.

12

So I would like you to refer me to the

13

record where your president of your client or somebody

14

else says, we are intending to produce some new shoes

15

that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will

16

look at that, because your opponent says we can find no

17

reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce

18

anything or they have any present intent of showing --

19

of producing something that falls outside that

20

definition.

21

But now, you just said, oh, no, we're

22

definitely going to.

23

the record that shows that because, of course, you win,

24

if that's true.

25

So just refer me to those pages in

MR. DABNEY:

Page 173A of the record, of the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Joint Appendix, states that, "The Petitioner is"

2

intending -- "is regularly engaged in the design of new

3

footwear."

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but that isn't the

5

point.

6

designing footwear that is not -- does not have the

7

appearance of any current or previous footwear product

8

designs or any colorable imitation thereof?

9

say you are in the business of producing new footwear,

10

at least, to me, suggests nothing because the question

11

is what the footwear looks like, not that you're

12

producing new footwear.

13

MR. DABNEY:

14

And so to

Your Honor, in the real world,

a business competitor -JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

The point is, is the new footwear that you're

the real world.

17

No, I'm not interested in

I am interested in the record.

MR. DABNEY:

The record does not show that

18

the Petitioner lacks any concrete interest in entering

19

the line of commerce that -JUSTICE BREYER:

20

And does it show anything

21

at all in respect that would support the claim that you

22

are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either

23

resemble, nor is a colorable imitation of anything that

24

you have previously produced or is the subject of the

25

case?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. DABNEY:

Your Honor, what the record

2

shows -- and it is what it is -- is that the petitioner

3

is actively engaged in designing and bringing out new

4

footwear products and --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. DABNEY:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Period?

Period.
Okay.

So I take it that

8

this case really boils down to should you have -- should

9

they have or you both have another chance to say what

10

the new footwear will be -- look like under a new

11

standard, or is there enough here already to say, well,

12

really, the judges could conclude that there is no real

13

likelihood that you're going to produce something that

14

won't look like what's already been produced.

15

MR. DABNEY:

We would respectfully submit

16

that, when you apply the mootness doctrine, since we're

17

not talking about picking a fight here, we're talking

18

about someone who was sued once -- once bitten, twice

19

shy -- that when someone has been sued for alleged

20

infringement has asked for a judgment that would

21

eliminate any need to think about whether or not a new

22

shoe will attract --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, and I assume that was

24

your point, that you shouldn't be put through the

25

trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or

2

are not.

You're at risk --

3

MR. DABNEY:

Exactly.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. DABNEY:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- right?

Exactly.
And I would think that you

7

would add this as well, that, for a competitor to demand

8

that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing,

9

is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably

10

quite injurious, in and of itself.

11

MR. DABNEY:

That would itself be --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, again, there's -- do

13

I just know that because I'm a judge?

14

someplace I can look for that?

15

MR. DABNEY:

Or is there

The law is that, as I stand

16

here today, the government has registered a claim that

17

the Petitioner is duty-bound not to bring out the shoe

18

shown in the registration, number one, which according

19

to the Respondent is one of the best-selling, most

20

profitable shoe styles of all time; and also, as I stand

21

here today, the law is that Petitioner is at risk if it

22

brings out a shoe that is going to be giving rise to a

23

plausible claim --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Dabney, are you

saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

good, unless it says that you will never be sued for any

2

shoe that you ever produce?

3

the covenant is no good or that this covenant is

4

deficient?

5

MR. DABNEY:

Is -- are you saying that

I'm saying that the Respondent

6

bore the burden of proving that the covenant completely

7

and irrevocably eradicated all of that.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- if -- if you are

uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you

10

say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate

11

protection, it should be amended, and then say what you

12

think you need to be adequately covered?

13

MR. DABNEY:

Because the Petitioner asks for

14

judgment in accordance with law, and it would prefer not

15

to be the involuntary licensee of the Respondent that

16

sued it.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, does that mean

18

that, if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-à-vis

19

your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is

20

invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact

21

duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with

22

respect to this design; would that be enough for you?

23

MR. DABNEY:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Your Honor, again -I know you want to help

everybody else -­

MR. DABNEY:

2

JUDGE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Not -- no --- but why wouldn't that

be --

4

MR. DABNEY:

That's -- that's not actually

5

right.

The reason why -- 70 years ago, Learned Hand

6

created the metaphor, "the scarecrow patent."

7

reason scarecrows are effective is not because they are

8

likely to climb down from the pole, but because, from a

9

distance and being looked at quickly, the way people in

And the

10

the marketplace have to react to official government

11

records of claims, they're deceptive.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

You get a lot of

13

what this extra stuff -- you know, that you say, well,

14

even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me

15

for that, there's all the collateral damage.

16

significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue.

17

Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and

18

right because, if they do, they will undermine their own

19

trademark.
MR. DABNEY:

20

You get a

Your Honor, the -- the covenant

21

actually reasserts the allegation that these shoes

22

infringe.

23

to waive --

24
25

The covenant does nothing more than purport

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
where does it do that?
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Where does it --

Official

1

MR. DABNEY:

It says it right on the -- on

2

page -- I believe it is 96 of -- of the record, where it

3

says, in the second whereas, "the actions complained of

4

no longer infringe or dilute at a level sufficient to

5

warrant the substantial time and expense."

6

libels --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

I mean, it

So if you

8

take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or

9

not?
MR. DABNEY:

10
11

There would be one small little

less bit of injury in this case.

12

That's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess maybe

13

this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking.

14

You're -- you're a lawyer in this area.

15

write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the

16

other side, but what does it say?

17

do you have to say, the only way this case can be

18

rendered moot is if the trademark is totally

19

invalidated?

20

MR. DABNEY:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You want to

Can you do that?

When someone seeks -No, no, that's kind

22

of a yes or no answer.

23

says something other than the trademark is totally

24

invalidated?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

No.

So --

But why?
-- what you're saying is

you --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're saying

7

that, in this case, there's no way -- I mean, I thought

8

it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties

9

to grant covenants of this sort.

10

You're saying this is

unheard of, nobody -- nobody can do this?

11

MR. DABNEY:

The practice in this case dates

12

to 1995.

This is a totally recent, controversial

13

practice that has never been embraced by this Court at

14

all.

15

after --

In fact, it was articulated in a case two years

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's not the question,

17

Mr. Dabney.

18

that exists in the world that would make you feel

19

secure?

20

difficulty with the answer, with an answer that says,

21

no, there is no covenant that you can write that would

22

make us feel secure.

23

The question is:

Is there any covenant

And I suppose I'm having a little bit of

MR. DABNEY:

The -- the reason is, Your

24

Honor, that the registration causes informational

25

injury.

And what the Respondent is trying to do is to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

hang on to government action that disadvantages its

2

competitor, while --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I don't know why --

4

my solution was that they would give you a covenant

5

that I suggested as a possibility that would say,

6

vis-à-vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this

7

design, only vis-à-vis you.

8

you fully?

9

the design if you want, so long as you're not using

Why doesn't that protect

Because what they're saying to you is, copy

10

11

is whether you're infringing this design.

12

But that's not the issue.

MR. DABNEY:

The issue

The question the trademark

13

practitioners get asked every day is whether something

14

is available.

15

covenant that's in the file of a company is not going to

16

prevent deception and confusion of people who look and

17

say, oh, this is a protected design.

18

And so long as that question is asked, a

It's not something that -- that you wear as a brand.

7

MR. DABNEY:

What is the

I

What we've substituted is

8

instead of getting a judgment in accordance with law

9

that expunges the allegedly invalid

10

government-registered claim of right to exclude

11

competition and sale of goods in favor of the chance to

12

litigate with our arch rival to see whether they will

13

prove --

14
15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you're going back to

saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good.
MR. DABNEY:

covenantor in possession of the unreviewed government

benefit that it got --

19

maybe you could suggest to me that I -- that we should

change what the law has been or not follow it here, but

22

where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth.

23

MR. DABNEY:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes.
And in Friends of the

Earth, it says a defendant -- namely Nike -- claiming
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're

2

claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case,

3

moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the

4

formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're

5

quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear,

6

correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely,

7

their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of

8

shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur.

9

And they say, since we promised in an

10

enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever --

11

100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur?

12

How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in

13

respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to

14

recur, given our covenant?

15

is?

16

MR. DABNEY:

And your response to that

The claim the

counterclaim

17

seeks to extinguish is not simply the particular rights

18

of action that they have covenanted not to exert.

19

claim that is sought to be extinguished is the much

20

broader government-registered claim of right to exclude

21

competition in the sale of shoes that embody that design.

Okay.

Just

19

because people are considering investing -- somebody who

20

came in and said, I've got this company, people are

21

thinking of investing in it, and therefore, you want to

22

proceed with your lawsuit?

23

MR. DABNEY:

It is undeniable, by law, that

24

the Petitioner's cost of operation -- the petitioner's

25

Risk of operation is increased because of -­
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that surely

2

would not establish Article III standings.

3

cost of operation is increased whenever there's any

4

trademark at all because you have to check and see

5

whether it violates a trademark.

6

MR. DABNEY:

Everybody's

Yes, but we're a direct

7

competitor, which we say is currently subject to an

8

unlawful restraint on our freedom to operate.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dabney, suppose there

10

had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but

11

you're in the shoe business and you're -- you're

12

worried -- could you have brought a declaratory action

13

or an action for an injunction to have the trademark

14

declared invalid?

15

MR. DABNEY:

When our shoes were launched,

16

it obviously never even occurred to the petitioner that

17

they could be deemed an infringement of any rights of

18

this respondent.

19

at that point.

20

bitten, twice shy -- we now have been told by the

21

respondent that it claims a far-reaching claim of right

22

to exclude competition in the sale of goods.

23

So the answer is we were not injured
But now, that we've been sued -- once

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you say you could not

24

have brought a suit to -- to cancel?

MR. DABNEY:

5

But since we're in a mootness case and we've been sued

6

and we've been told and have all these defamatory

7

allegations about and dragged our company's name through

8

the mud, the situation is different, as Your Honor has

said.

So, no, of course, there would

11

the difference is that you've been sued, then it should

12

be adequate protection, if you know that you won't be

sued again.

14

kind of covenant would give you adequate protection that

15

you won't be sued again?

16

And that's why there's the question of what

MR. DABNEY:

If the -- as I said before, if

17

the only injury we were complaining about and trying to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS,

7

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND

9
10

MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

A trademark holder can moot a declaratory

12

judgment action seeking to invalidate a trademark by

13

offering the plaintiff a sufficiently broad covenant not

14

to sue.

15

between the parties should be analyzed under the

16

voluntary cessation doctrine.

Whether the covenant eliminates the controversy

17

The analysis that the government is

18

proposing is both a way of determining whether the

19

covenant has eliminated any concrete dispute between the

20

parties and also a framework for the parties to use to

21

negotiate the appropriate scope of the covenant.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Anders, what --

23

there is a question about why a competitor should have

24

to produce to its competition its future plans of

25

development.

I mean, the marketplace, especially in
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fashion, importantly, likes to keep quiet what it's

2

doing because what -- it doesn't want other imitators to

3

beat it to the punch.

4

So given that interest, why isn't their

5

claim that they're being inhibited because of the

6

requirement to produce their products -- or their

7

intended products -- enough to establish injury in this

8

case?

9

MS. ANDERS:

Well, once the -- once the

10

defendant offers the covenant, then the question becomes

11

whether there is anything that the plaintiff is

12

intending to do, its current activities or its -- its

13

concrete plans for anticipated activities that would

14

fall outside the covenant and potentially be infringing.

15

Because if those activities exist, then the covenant has

16

not --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then what did -Could we say there is just

19

a presumption, that, if you're in the business, that you

20

probably are interested in future design, period?

21

MS. ANDERS:

I don't think that -- I don't

22

think that presumption would establish a concrete

23

interest.

The question here is whether --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MS. ANDERS:

Wouldn't establish a --

It would not establish that the
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiff has a concrete interest.

2

whether the dispute between the parties is reasonably

3

likely to recur.

4

anything that it's currently doing or that it's planning

5

to do --

6

The question is

And if the plaintiff cannot point to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I read this affidavit as

7

saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make

8

new shoes regularly, we want to copy their shoe, we

9

don't think it's protected by trademark, we want to copy

10

it -- they don't say -- and that's something on rebuttal

11

that maybe Petitioner will explain -- that we want to

12

copy it exactly.

13

copy it because it's a free form.

14

read their affidavit as saying.

But what they're saying is, we want to
That's really what I

So if -- why do they have to actually -- do

15
16

they have to produce their design to prove they're doing

17

that?

18

MS. ANDERS:

I think what they have to do is

19

they have to state that they intend to make products

20

that may be outside the covenant.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And now --

But saying it is enough?

22

That's what I thought their affidavit said, and I

23

thought the court below said, no, you've got to show us

24

the product.

25

MS. ANDERS:

I think the -- the affidavit
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says that they intend to produce new shoes as a general

2

matter.

3

whether they -- it doesn't give us a way of knowing

4

whether they might fall outside the covenant.

It doesn't tell us what those shoes may be,

5

And I --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Please, now go back to

7

my question.

Is it enough to just say it?

Or do they

8

have to produce the designs, so that the Court and Nike

9

can decide -- it is Nike, right? -- the Court and Nike

10

can decide whether the shoe is a colorable imitation or

11

an exact copy.

12

MS. ANDERS:

I think that could depend on

13

the breadth of the covenant.

I think, in some cases,

14

for instance, if the covenant doesn't cover any future

15

products, it may be enough for the plaintiff to credibly

16

allege, we intend to make future products that aren't

17

covered.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MS. ANDERS:

I agree with you.

So I also think that it may

20

depend -- the less far along a party's plans are to make

21

its shoes, the easier it will be for the defendant to

22

say, it is speculative that your plans will actually

23

mature into something that doesn't --

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Anders, take this

case, where Already says -- you know, we're not really
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

going to say anything particular.

2

say that we're in the business of making shoes, and we

3

might make a shoe.

4

would not be enough under your standard; is that

5

correct?

6

We're just going to

Would that -- would that -- that

MS. ANDERS:

I think that's right.

I think

7

if the parties went back on remand in this case -- and

8

we do think there should be a remand here -- but if the

9

parties went back and we had the exact same facts, and

10

Nike said that anything that was a colorable imitation

11

of Already's shoes was covered by the covenant, and

12

Already came back and said, just generally, we're making

13

new shoes, I think, in that situation, it would be

14

relatively easy for Nike to show that the possibility

15

that Already would be impacted by the covenant -- or

16

impacted by the trademark, I'm sorry -- would be

17

speculative.

18

So that --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Given what Already has said

20

in this case, why is it that you think that we should

21

remand?

22

no purpose, given what Already has said throughout the

23

course of the litigation and, indeed, in this Court

24

today.

25

I mean, it sounds as though we're remanding for

MS. ANDERS:

I think there are two reasons.
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The first is that, when this Court establishes a new

2

standard, it often -- it traditionally will remand to

3

allow the courts -- the lower courts to apply that

4

standard in the first instance.

5

And the second is that there was some

6

uncertainty about what the covenant meant below.

7

Nike represented that the covenant covered the existing

8

shoes, and Already said, in its motion to dismiss

9

briefing, that it thought that the covenant did not -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

So

But its future -- its

11

future shoes are clearly -- and I thought the counsel

12

for the Petitioner might have -- might have added this

13

in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future

14

shoes are not covered by this.

15

has the heavy burden of proof, can it have discovery and

16

take depositions on what their plans are, what their

17

marketing plans are, what designs they're thinking

18

about?

19

MS. ANDERS:

And the -- if -- if Nike

I think that would be one way

20

for Nike to try to establish that -- that the dispute is

21

not reasonably likely to recur.

22

covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no

25

other manufacturer has.

MS. ANDERS:

I don't think it does give

the --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you mean any

4

manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask

5

Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you

6

thinking about?

7

MS. ANDERS:

Well, once Already produces --

8

once Already identifies what its future activities may

be --

and, again -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why should Already

have to do that to anybody?

12

MS. ANDERS:

Well, we think it makes sense

13

for Already to have to -- have to at least identify here

14

what activities it thinks may not be outside the

15

covenant.

16

reason is that if -- if Already's evidence convinces the

17

court that the case isn't moot, then Already gets its

question on that, and it's a little bit off of what

we've been talking about.

Well, a couple of points on

that.

Court should dismiss discretionarily every action just

19

because the TTAB exists and can adjudicate --

20

The first is that we are not proposing that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That was a big part of

21

your argument.

22

you can always go to the patent level.

23

You were telling us, oh, don't worry,

MS. ANDERS:

What we're proposing here is

24

that, as a function of the Court's broader discretion

25

under the Declaratory Judgment Act and United States v.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

W. T. Grant, is that when the Court believes that it

2

probably does -- does have jurisdiction but it doesn't

3

think that the likelihood of a dispute is -- is really

4

that great, that in that situation, it can

5

discretionarily dismiss.

6
7

So that would be a situation in which there
is Article III --

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

My -- my question is:

Is the Article III requirement that Already has the same

10

in this case as it would be if they sought judicial

11

review from an adverse order of the administrative

12

agency?

13

MS. ANDERS:

The administrative agency's

14

standing rules are broader than Article III, so it

15

would -- it is easier to get --

16
17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm talking about going to

court.
MS. ANDERS:

And so once it goes to court,

19

there may be rare cases in which Already, as the party

20

that lost, if it isn't injured in fact by the TTAB's

21

decision itself, that it would not have the necessary

22

Article III injury to seek judicial review.

23

hasn't -- to our knowledge, that has not occurred, but

24

it is possible that that could happen because 15 U.S.C.

in Article III.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Anders, you did say,

3

if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as

4

the preferred form for cancellation proceedings.

5

the statute sets up the PTO proceeding, but it also

6

allows the claim to be brought in -- in court.

7

what -- what shows that Congress meant these claims to

8

be -- to go to the agency in preference to the court?

9

MS. ANDERS:

The --

So

Well, I think Congress didn't

10

set it up as an exhaustion requirement, so I don't think

11

it's preferred for all of these claims to go to the TTAB.

12

But the TTAB is the expert body that -- that adjudicates

13

cancellation of validity issues all the time.

14

there could be circumstances in which it would be

15

particularly appropriate for a district court to consider

16

the existence of the TTAB proceeding.

17

So we think

For instance, if there's a related

18

proceeding pending before the TTAB or there's a

19

concurrent proceeding, something like that, we think it

20

would make sense for the district court in considering

21

whether to dismiss the action to take that into account.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

23

answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that

24

the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you

25

is an additional injury in fact that gives you Article

III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the

circumstances in which the TTAB's decision would create

injury in fact if it said something about the scope of

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you

very much, may it please the Court:
You will want to have available to you the

15
16

cert petition and the small volume of the Joint

17

Appendix.

18

In our submission, the Court needs to adopt

19

a rule that has balance to it, and that is there -- it

20

has to be possible to resolve one of these cases through

21

a covenant not to sue of appropriate breadth, but it

22

also has to be the case that a covenant not to sue can't

23

just always eliminate the other side's injury.

24

it's going to depend on the covenant and it's going to

25

depend on what the other side says about its plans.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

And our point in this case is that you

2

should adopt the following rule:

3

have a covenant not to sue and it covers everything that

4

the other side alleges an intent to produce, then there

5

is no more injury.

6

may well be injury.

If it doesn't cover that, then there

7

And our point --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

And that is, if you

How do you deal with the

point that's been discussed with your adversary, they

10

have to show you everything they intend to produce?

11

What entitles you to that showing?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Absolutely.

So one thing

13

that's very important to recognize -- two things about

14

trademark practice.

15

cases -- remember, most of the time the question of

16

trademark or patent validity will just be a suit for

So that, Justice Kennedy, with respect, it's

actually not true that this is an unusual situation or

2

that we would get some special advantage.

3

In every single patent or trademark

4

invalidity case, after this Court's decision in

5

MedImmune, the party alleging invalidity, in order to

6

show its standing, has to say, we intend to make a

7

product that is regarded as potentially infringing.

So, first, let me start with how the case

17

came to you, and that is the court of appeals, what it

18

understood the record -- and the district court

understood the record to be, and that is going to be in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein, how the

case came to us -- how this case originated was a

counterclaim.

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And at the time the

1

counterclaim was asserted, there was certainly Article

2

III jurisdiction over the counterclaim, right?

That's absolutely right.

And we accept, for present purposes, that there is going

5

to be a reduced requirement under the voluntary

6

cessation doctrine.

7

that's true, but I assume, for the purposes of these

answers, that the Court is going to apply the heightened

9

burden on us to show that the case is over.

10

We briefed why we don't think

And we believe that we showed beyond

11

peradventure -- that we really resolved this case, when

affirmatively granted them a covenant not to sue that

covered not only their existing products.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And they're correct

Justice Kennedy, I -- I may

22

have confused things.

This is the situation with the

23

covenant:

24

they have made in the past, everything they were making

25

at the time and every future product of theirs that is a

Our covenant not to sue covers everything

colorable imitation.

2

Our point is not that it covers every future

3

shoe of theirs.

4

You are absolutely right, Justice Kennedy, that there

5

are shoes that they could make in the future that would

6

not be covered by the covenant.

7

injury about that.

8

We're on the same page in that respect.

There could be an

And so my point about the record in the case

9

and how the case was developed and how we might have

10

modified the covenant, if they had told us anything,

11

suggesting -- suggested anything outside the covenant

12

they might want to make, is let's look at what they

13

actually told the district court and the court of

14

appeals about what their intentions were.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's -- so it's a

16

question of -- of deficiency in their pleading.

17

they amended that counterclaim and said, as soon as we

18

are able, we want to do a counterfeit.

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

Suppose

It is not a deficiency

20

in the pleading.

21

point about this -- it's very important for the Court to

22

understand that this case was not dismissed just on the

23

pleadings.

24

allegation.

25

It's a deficiency in the proof.

So my

It wasn't just an insufficiency in their

And they said, well, actually, we have more
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that we want to say, because we actually can explain to

2

the courts that we want to make other shoes.

3

The case was decided on a fully developed

4

record.

5

declarations in response that described their intentions

6

precisely.

7

We moved to dismiss.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They submitted five

But suppose in a different

8

hypothetical case, they had said, what we want to do is

9

to copy Nike's shoe --

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- what then should have

12
13

happened then, in your view?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So I do -- I would

14

love to return to what actually happened.

15

hypothetical, what would happen is that our motion to

16

dismiss would be denied, unless and until we could prove

17

that what they were saying wasn't true because it is

18

absolutely the case -- and it is a strong point in our

19

favor -- that you can't evade an attempt to invalidate

20

your trademark through a covenant not to sue because you

21

can't give a covenant not to sue over a counterfeit

22

because you are in real risk of being deemed to have

23

abandoned the mark because you're just --

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Why?

Why?

But in that

I know you

said that in your brief, but if you give it -- yes, if
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it,

2

but this covenant would give it to only one

3

manufacturer.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's correct.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why would you

6

abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount

7

to abandonment of your mark?

8
9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
question in the law.

Okay.

It is not a settled

There is no case that has

10

considered this question.

11

abandonment would say is that we would have licensed

12

Already then to increase its production and its

13

distribution.

14

What a party claiming

But even if one didn't agree with that,

15

Justice Ginsburg, my point would be this:

16

you can't continually evade an attempt to invalidate

17

your mark because, certainly, the agree -- we would

18

agree that if you give a second one of these things out

19

or the third one, you would be abandoning the mark.

have some actual facts for you about this, and that --

to know.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so for

Counsel, could you

go back to Justice Breyer's question and answer that?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

Yes.

So page 173 --

21

because there is a record here.

You -- you don't have

22

to hypothesize.

This was all on the table in the

23

district court.

We said, they have no intention, no

24

desire, no nothing, to make something that is not

25

unambiguously covered by the covenant.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And Justice Ginsburg did point out, in

2

passing, that if they said something to the contrary, we

3

would have modified the covenant.

4

said -- and I -- it would take a lot of your time for me

5

to read all seven paragraphs on page 173, but they

6

don't --

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So here's what they

Yes.

You don't have to

read to us.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So these paragraphs

10

do not say -- they do not suggest, they do not imply --

11

even between the lines -- an intention to make something

12

that is outside the covenant.

13

that's --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

They just don't.

And

What they say is that they

15

changed this at the rate of a mile a minute -- you know,

16

they have -- they have stuff they put out, and we have

17

the YUMS and the Sweet -- whatever it is and the Jelly

18

Bean and so forth, and we keep changing it.

19

And so I don't know.

I mean, it doesn't

20

seem clear, one way or the other.

If it is -- if I come

21

to that conclusion, is it the case -- I thought perhaps,

22

in looking at this, that the line I quoted -- remember,

23

which puts a lot of burden on you, from Friends of the

24

Earth -- is not quoted in the district court, not quoted

25

in the Court of Appeals, so perhaps the thing -- I think
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the SG wants something like it.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you say, okay, this is

4

the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this.

5

seem to have conducted this case without that standard

6

quite in mind.

7

it -- you know, depending on the facts, and you have

8

these protective orders, da, da, da, so send it back,

9

use the right standard, and give Nike a chance and give

10

13
14

It's tough for Nike, but they can do

them a chance, and that way, we --

11
12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought what they were

arguing -JUSTICE BREYER:

What about that?

I would

like to know what the answer to that question is here.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

You

Okay.

Do you want -Answer

Justice Breyer's question.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Excellent.
All right.

Justice Breyer,

20

so you've got a choice.

21

you could say, well, maybe you will win on remand.

22
23

You could let us win now, or

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's your opinion,

that you will win on remand.

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

25

(Laughter.)

Okay.
Okay.

Right.

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

And, Justice Breyer,

2

I have two answers for you.

3

first one is going to be about the facts of the case,

4

and the second is just going to be jurisprudential.

5

first one is what more could one imagine in such an

6

opinion that you would ask Nike to do on a remand?

7

Number one is going -- the

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

I would ask Nike, I

8

suppose, Nike could say -- you know, I read the page 73

9

and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and

10

we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean, and they're sort of

11

like our shoe, but we didn't think enough, but you did

12

think enough, and are some of these changes that could

13

happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to

14

think -- you know, that they won't look really colorably

15

even like what you just did, but nonetheless, is a

16

pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our

17

present trademark.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Justice Breyer -That's a long question, I

don't know if I'll get a good answer.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I hope you'll get a

22

good answer.

The -- my point is this, Justice Breyer:

23

what you've just said on remand, what we would do is ask

24

a question.

25

point is this:

We wouldn't try to prove and anything.

My

Already has told the district court, the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court of appeals, and this Court everything that it

2

wants to say about its intentions.

3

It has had every opportunity in every court

4

to have its lawyers simply say, Justice Sotomayor, this

5

is not an accident.

6

they want to make a covenant of the -- a copy of the Air

7

Force 1 is that they don't want to make a copy of the

8

Air Force 1.

9

this back to give -- ask Already, again, the question

The reason they are not saying that

There is no reason in the world to send

10

that has been asked in three separate courts.

11

I said I had a jurisprudential --

12

jurisprudential answer to you as well, and that is the

13

case was presented to you as presenting a question of

14

law, and that is, can you have a covenant not to sue

15

that will end a case like this?

16

And if you tell the lower courts, we don't

17

know, you are doing, I think, not as much of a service

18

to the development of the law as you could.

19

much more sound approach, we think, to say Already had

20

the chance to build its record --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is a

Mr. Goldstein, can you

22

inform us of when this practice of the unilateral

23

covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim,

24

when -- how long has it been around?

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is still -- it has been
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

around for at least 20 years.

2

common for the very important reason that trademark

3

owners know that, if they hand these things out, they

4

are at risk of having their mark invalidated; and

5

second, they know that it doesn't avoid a -- a

6

determination of the validity of the mark because a

7

party like Already can always go to the Federal agency,

8

the TTAB.

9

It is still not very

So I said I have some actual facts.

And the

10

facts are these:

11

portfolio, it has only, once in its history, issued a

12

covenant not to sue.

13

Although Nike has a broad trademark

It is in this case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's because it usually

14

sues.

15

"Your Honor, over the past eight months, Nike has

16

cleared out the worst offending infringers.

17

Already remains as one of the last few companies that

18

was identified on that top ten list of infringers."

19

Page -- page 114 of the Joint Appendix says,

20
21

Now,

I mean, that -- that's your company's
policy.

That's your attorney, I take it.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We -- Justice Kennedy, we do

22

enforce our trademarks.

23

tell you that we have filed six trade dress actions in

24

the company's history.

25

You say we usually sue.

I will

Now, you had said, because I think it's the
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other side's -- the impression the other side has given,

2

that we are getting a special advantage over them.

3

think it's really important to recognize, for purposes

4

of standing doctrine and mootness doctrine, that of all

5

the shoe manufacturers in the country, the one that is

6

least likely to be injured by this trademark -- there is

7

only one.

8
9

I

And it is Already because they are the only
company in the entire world that has a promise that's

10

substantial not to be sued under this trademark.

11

the one -- they are the ones that are least likely to

12

come into conflict with Nike.

13
14

We are

Now, they --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that's because

you gave them the covenant after you sued them.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

Yes.

Yes, that's right, but

16

we did give them the covenant.

17

the covenant -- we didn't merely withdraw the case.

18

have one other piece of fact.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's my point.

After
I

What -- what -- what's the

20

consideration -- I used to teach contract law.

21

is -- you know, you can just give a covenant like that?

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

This

Yes, we're judicially

23

estopped.

It's not a contract.

We are estopped, and

24

they have -- the district court acted in reliance on it,

25

construed it, and so we are bound by it.
49
Alderson Reporting Company

It's not a

Official

1

contract.

2

I did have one other fact for you, because

3

the other side has given you this impression that, once

4

bitten, twice shy; that if you are sued once for a

5

trademark -- they have a special fear that they're in

6

the cross-hairs, that we're watching everything that

7

they do.

8
9

So when they made this argument -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They are on the top ten

list of infringers.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

They are on the top

12

ten list of infringers.

13

they, and they alone, got a covenant not to be sued,

14

under the -- they are the -- they are in the specially

15

protected position, not a specially disadvantaged

16

position.

17

But after that -- after that

I did, however -- when they made this

18

argument in the reply brief -- tried to figure out if

19

that is true.

20

is sued once has a legitimate worry that they will

21

actually be sued again?

22

Is it actually the case that a person who

So you should lower the -- the mootness or

23

standing bar still further.

So we looked at every

24

single trademark action between 2000 -- January 1, 2000,

25

and December 31, 2004, all of them.
50
Alderson Reporting Company

There were 593.

Official

1

And over the next eight years, we tried to figure out

2

how many times did the plaintiff sue the defendant

3

again.

It happened six times, so --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that.

But I thought

5

your response to Justice Kennedy was a different one.

6

liked it because it was that -- the concern that Nike

7

can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but

8

it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a

9

trademark infringement case because that manufacturer

I

10

has to show he is now making the product; or, if not, he

11

intends to.

12

the defendant can go and look and see if that's true.

And if it's a question of intends to, then

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And your response, I took

15

it, to that was there are procedures that deal with

16

that.

17

Is that -- have I got that right with your argument?

They're called protective orders and so forth.

18
19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
not be more right.

20
21
22

You could not -- you could

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what your argument

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It's also the truth that --

is, yes.

23

that it is what happens in every single patent and

24

trademark invalidity case.

25

to Article III injury, then every party has standing to

If you believe that gives rise

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

challenge every competitor.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein, what about

3

Federal Rule 41(a)(2)?

It says, if the defendant has

4

pleaded a counterclaim -- and you have recognized that

5

there was Article III jurisdiction over that

6

counterclaim -- the case may be dismissed on the

7

plaintiff's request over the defendant's objection, only

8

if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent

9

adjudication.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So on the face of it, it

12

seems that this -- that that rule fits this case to a T;

13

that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn,

14

defendant objects, and the question is can the

15

counterclaim remain pending for independent

16

adjudication.

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

I think the reason

18

they did not pursue the Rule 41 argument in this Court

19

and abandoned it is that it's completely understood

20

that, if the party that's instituting the claim says I'm

21

not going to pursue my case at all, there simply is no

22

Article III jurisdiction.

23

dismissal, there is no case or controversy remaining in

24

the case.

25

And so even without a Rule 41

The district court -- the court of appeals
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

might also have said, when it's dealt with this issue on

2

8(a) and 9(a) of the petition appendix, that they

3

actually acceded to the dismissal of our claims.

4

They're happy to have our claims gone.

5

say, we'll take the dismissal of the -- sorry -- the

6

plaintiff's claim, but want to have the counterclaim

7

remaining.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you referred, just

in a fleeting way, to the fact that they can go to the
PTO and to the board?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

And you can't

Yes.
What about my question,

and I wasn't -- it was probably my fault --

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, I understand --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- I didn't quite

16

understand the government's petition.

17

burden any less after there is a -- an administrative

18

adjudication and you go to court for judicial review?

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Is the standing

The Chief Justice suggested

20

an argument that could be made.

It is an argument that

21

we disagree with.

22

that it's a point in their favor, Justice Kennedy, that,

23

while you can go to the TTAB, they wouldn't be able to

24

appeal to an Article III court.

25

in their favor.

We've looked at the cases.

We think

I think that's a point

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

A point in our favor, however, is this

2

notion of scarecrow trademarks hanging out there on the

3

fields is inaccurate because of the ability to go to the

4

TTAB in the first instance; they're experts.

5

second, remember what I said to Justice Sotomayor,

6

anybody in this market can say we want to counterfeit

7

the Air Force 1 -- we just want to make a copy of it,

8

it's not complicated -- and they will have the right to

9

bring a claim to invalidate the mark.

10

And

So we can't leave

the trademark hanging out there.

11

I have kept trying to come back -- and if I

12

could, in my remaining time, to the understanding of the

13

lower courts about the record because I said, Justice

14

Breyer, I think it would be much better for you to

15

resolve the case because they had the opportunity to

16

build a record, the case came to you on two courts'

17

understanding of the record, and so if I could take you

18

back to 14(a) and 15(a) of the petition appendix?

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I interject just one

20

thing that I would like you to clarify?

21

started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of

apply, here's how they apply:

When you not just dismiss

6

the case, but you grant the covenant not to sue, and the

7

covenant not to sue says, I won't sue you over what

8

you're doing now or anything that I can imagine you

9

doing in the future because you haven't told me anything

10

else, then you have ensured that the controversy can't

11

arise again, and you've met the Voluntary Cessation

12

Doctrine.

13

If, on the other hand, the other side comes

14

forward with a declaration from an officer or some other

15

form of proof that says, no, I'm worried I might do

16

something outside the covenant, I would definitely want

17

to make a counterfeit, then the case is going to go on.

18

But this case is not that hypothetical case.

19

On 14(a), the first full paragraph, seven lines from the

20

bottom, "Given the similarity of YUMS' designs to the

21

'905 mark and the breadth of the covenant, it is hard to

22

imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe the

23

'905 mark and yet not fall under the covenant.

24

not asserted any intention to market any such shoe."

25

YUMS has

And then in footnote 5, on 15(a), "Given the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

absence of record evidence that YUMS intends to make any

2

arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously

3

covered by the covenant, this hypothetical possibility

4

does not create a definite and concrete dispute."

5

That's how the case should be resolved.

6

should say, yes, there can be other cases where the

7

covenant is too narrow; yes, there can be other cases

8

where someone does allege a desire to make a

9

counterfeit.

Those are different cases.

You

But do not, I

10

suggest to you, remand when the facts have already been

11

developed in this case.

12

If we lose on this record, we lose on this

13

record.

14

because the record has been built in this case and it is

15

settled.

16

But if we win on this record, we win on it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DABNEY:

Your Honor, the covenant --

10

the -- the affidavits in this case were prepared about

11

five weeks after this completely unexpected development

12

in the middle of a hard-pressed litigation was made.

13

And the position that the Petitioner made to

14

the district court was there is obviously subject matter

15

jurisdiction here, not just because of the Rule 41

16

point, but that you can't say, well, we have a case that

17

raises these three issues.

18

single judgment right now, the plaintiff's claims are

19

waived because they've waived them, the trademark is

20

invalid, and the registration was unlawfully issued and

21

should be granted.

22

You could, say, enter a

Courts issue judgments on the basis of

23

alternative holdings all the time.

24

why we're even talking about this is that Judge Sullivan

25

1

one issue in isolation, and then the other thing came up

2

separately.

3

now, but if you doubt it, we request leave to amend our

4

counterclaim to assert claims for invalid procurement of

5

registration and other things that could have been

6

asserted.

7

So we said, we think there's a case right

So the -- the state of the record reflects

8

the -- the suddenness with which the -- the plaintiff

9

most unexpectedly did what it now says, in public, it's

10

never done before and dropped its claim so unexpectedly

11

in the case.

12

So there's no question, but that if -- if it

13

turns out that it's not enough to say that we're

14

actively engaged, and we want to do all of the things

15

any person in a normal position would want to do, and we

16

have a concrete interest, the -- the defendant can

17

certainly allege more than what it has been alleged.

the Respondent's evidence shows in this case.

he said.

And if he can't say anything like that at all,

MR. DABNEY:

I mean, that's --

The practical problem here is

incorrect.

The suggestion that we
