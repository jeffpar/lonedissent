ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICKI C. JACKSON

ON BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

10
11

MS. JACKSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

There is no justiciable case before this

13

Court.

Petitioner, the United States, does not ask this

14

Court to redress the injuries it asserts.

15

Representatives' Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, the

16

BLAG, which does seek redress in the form of reversal,

17

asserts no judicially cognizable injury.

18

The House of

While it is natural to want to reach the

19

merits of such a significant issue, as in Raines v.

20

Byrd, this natural urge must be put aside because

21

however important the constitutional question, Article

22

III prevents its decision here and requires this Court

23

to await another case, another day, to decide the

24

question.

25

In the district court, Ms. Windsor alleged
5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

classical Article III injury for which she sought

2

redress.

3

could likewise sue in a first instance court and, if

4

their challenge succeeds, obtain relief.

5

exercise jurisdiction on this appeal when the United

6

States asked for the judgment below, fully agrees with

7

it, and --

Other persons injured by DOMA's operation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning another person who

10

is -- whose benefits are withheld, tax refund is

11

withheld, is going to be in an identical situation to

12

her?

Who else could come in?

13

MS. JACKSON:

Your Honor, it is possible

14

that in district courts where other taxpayers sue the

15

United States on similar relief, that the district

16

courts will rule differently.

17

court that I'm aware of, in a case called

18

Louie v. Holder, ruled against -- upheld DOMA even

19

though the government had switched its position at that

20

time.

Excuse me.

24

trial level?

MS. JACKSON:

Your Honor -­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the government

2

comes in and says "I agree" -- or if there was

3

jurisdiction, why did the Court ever have to get to the

4

merits?

5

If you have a, let's say, a lawsuit on an --

6

on an indebtedness and the alleged debtor comes in and

7

says, yes, I owe them money, but I'm just not gonna pay

8

it, which is the equivalent of the government saying,

9

yes, it's unconstitutional but I'm going to enforce it

10
11

anyway.
What would happen in that -- in that

12

indebtedness suit is that the court would enter judgment

13

and say, if you agree that you owe it, by God, you

14

should pay it.

15

there without any consideration of the merits, right?

16

Why didn't that happen here?

17

And there would be a judgment right

MS. JACKSON:

Your Honor, the -- the two

18

questions that you asked me, why did the district court

19

have jurisdiction, the first answer is that the party

20

invoking the district court's jurisdiction was Ms.

21

Windsor, who did have an injury.

22

As to why the district court didn't enter

23

judgment when the United States switched its position,

24

I -- I imagine that the Court was -- would have wanted

25

to have development of that issue, which was achieved
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

through the intervention of the BLAG in the trial court,

2

so that the judgment of unconstitutionality and of

3

refund would have had a robust hearing as it did.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Really, that's very

5

peculiar.

6

on what the law is?

7

When -- when both parties to the case agree

jurisdiction of the Court, it seems to me, is not

10

affected by the length of the proceedings it undertook.

11

In Kentucky --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not talking about

13

jurisdiction now.

14

court, without getting to the merits, should not have

15

entered judgment against the government.

16

I'm talking about why the district

MS. JACKSON:

I am not sure I have a

17

wonderful answer to that question, Justice Scalia, but I

18

do think the case bears some similarities to Kentucky v.

19

Indiana, which was discussed by the parties, where

20

Kentucky sued Indiana in this Court's original

21

5

III courts, notwithstanding that it doesn't seek relief,

6

it seeks affirmance.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the U.S. is

Well, the Solicitor

8

General's standing argument is very abstract.

But here

is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the

Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like

this.

12

13

that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court

14

tells him to stop.

15

The President's position in this case is that he

The judgment of the Second Circuit told the

16

Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection

17

Clause immediately.

18

temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved

19

in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do

20

something prior to the point when the Executive believes

21

it should do that thing.

22

The President disagrees with the

Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make --

23

to create injury in the Executive and render the

24

Executive an aggrieved party?

25

MS. JACKSON:

I think not, Your Honor.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

I

1

think not because I don't see how that would be any

2

different from any party saying, well, we really don't

3

want to pay this judgment until we're sure all of the

4

courts agree.

5

doesn't have a lot of case law where a party seeks

6

review to get affirmance.

7

And I think this Court's -- this Court

case, there was a State court conviction, high State

There'd be standing in the second case for

6

any fiduciary, despite his personal beliefs, to

7

continue.

We'd understand that and say there was

8

standing.

Why don't we here?

9

MS. JACKSON:

Well, the trustee, I think,

10

would be able to go to a court of first instance to get

11

an adjudication of the claim.

12

you that the trustee could not do, after getting the

13

first -- the judgment in the court of first instance

14

stating what the remedy -- what the liability is, then

15

seek review of that judgment, but ask only for it to be

16

affirmed.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm submitting to

And that's the part I don't

18

understand.

For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the

19

trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed

20

have standing to act according to the law, even though

21

he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of

22

his obligation such as under Section 2.

23

has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into

court in the first place, which surely he could

2

the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by

4

you from doing the second?

5

If you could do the first, what suddenly stops

MS. JACKSON:

In the first instance, the

6

obligations are uncertain the trustee is presumably

7

subject to potentially adverse competing claims on his

8

or her action.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I would have

thought --

11

MS. JACKSON:

Those are --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

13

your answer would be that the Executive's obligation to

14

execute the law includes the obligation to execute the

15

law consistent with the Constitution.

16

made a determination that executing the law by enforcing

17

the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he

18

doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute

19

not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view

20

of the Constitution, rather than saying, oh, we'll wait

21

till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice.

22

MS. JACKSON:

And if he has

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

23

that's a hard question under Article II.

24

the Article III questions that this Court is facing turn

25

on what the parties in the case have alleged, what

1

relief they're seeking, and what the posture is.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Federal court's

3

jurisprudence, are you saying there's a lack of

4

adversity here?

5

MS. JACKSON:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Can you give us a

pigeonhole?

8
9

I am saying primarily --

MS. JACKSON:

I -- it's a little difficult

because the circumstance is unusual, Justice Kennedy,

10

but I think the most apt of the doctrines, although they

11

are overlapping and reinforce each other, the most apt

12

is standing.

13

This Court has made clear that a party on

14

appeal has to meet the same Article III standing

15

requirements of injury caused by the action complained

16

of and redressable by the relief requested by the

17

parties.

18
19
20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it seems to me

there -- there's injury here.
MS. JACKSON:

Well, Your Honor, I do not

21

agree that the injuries alleged by the United States

22

should be cognizable by the Article III courts because

23

those injuries are exactly what it asked the courts

24

below to -- to produce.

25

injuries as sufficiently alleged, Article III requires

But even if we treat the

Alderson Reporting Company

that the party complaining of injury ask the court to

remedy that injury.

4

reasons.

5

And that's a very important

The idea of the case or controversy

7

separation of powers picture, to make sure the Federal

courts perform their proper role.

Their proper role is

And it is the need to redress

10

injury in ordinary litigation that justifies judicial

11

review of constitutional issues.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But --

But, Ms. Jackson, I mean, to

13

go back to Justice Kennedy's point, we have injury here

14

in the most classic, most concrete sense.

15

$300,000 that's going to come out of the government's

16

treasury if this decision is upheld, and it won't if it

17

isn't.

18

There's

Now, the government is willing to pay that

19

$300,000, would be happy to pay that $300,000.

20

whether the government is happy or sad to pay that

21

$300,000, the government is still paying the $300,000,

22

which in the usual set of circumstances is the classic

23

Article III injury.

24

Why isn't it here?

25

MS. JACKSON:

But

Justice Kagan, there is a
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

three-prong test.

2

does not meet the requirements for standing on appeal

3

because the government has not asked this Court to

4

remedy that injury.

5

Court to overturn the rulings below so it doesn't have

6

to pay the $365,000.

7

And the case or controversy requirements that we're

8

talking about are nested in an adversarial system where

9

we rely on the parties to state their injuries and make

Even if you treat that as injury, it

their claims for relief.

11

If the government or any party is not bound

13

a remedy, what that does is it enables the Court to fill

14

in, to reshape.

15

be limiting the occasions for judicial review of

16

constitutionality, that is troubling.

17

And for a doctrine that is supposed to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But don't we often separate

18

those two things, ask whether there's injury for Article

19

III purposes and causation and redressability, as you

20

say, but then say, well, sometimes when all of those are

21

met, there's not going to be adequate presentation of

22

the arguments, and so we will appoint an amicus or we'll

restructure things?

And we do that when the government
I mean, we do that several times

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. JACKSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

But

2

confession of error cases, with respect, are quite

3

different because in confession of error cases typically

4

both parties at the appellate level end up being adverse

5

to the judgment below and they are asking relief from

6

this Court from the judgment below.

7

But here we have a situation where, putting

8

BLAG to one side for the moment, between the United

9

States and Ms. Windsor there is no adversity, they're in

10

agreement, and neither of them is asking this Court to

11

reverse or modify the judgment below.

12

the confession of error cases are quite different from

13

the perspective of Article III.
JUSTICE BREYER:

14

And so I think

No, they're -- they're not

15

in agreement about whether to pay the money or not.

16

They are in agreement about what arguments are correct

17

legal arguments.

18

the sham cases which -- which this isn't, where -- where

19

you would find no standing or other obstacle.

20

think of one case, which you haven't mentioned, namely,

21

Chadha, which seems about identical.

22

MS. JACKSON:

And I can't think of a case other than

And I can

Your Honor, I don't think that

23

In -- for two main

24

reasons.

statute, since repealed, 1252, which gave this Court

3

mandatory jurisdiction in cases in which a Federal

4

statute was held unconstitutional and the U.S. was a

5

party.

statute permitted the appeal.

7

may I reserve my time for rebuttal?

And it framed its analysis of whether the

It intensively analyzed a

What I think was -- oh,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can finish your

sentence.

10

MS. JACKSON:

Thank you.

11

What was -- what was going on there was the

12

Court said, well, the statute wanted to reach very

13

broadly, perhaps implicit, not stated, perhaps more

14

broadly than Article III.

15

Congress said whenever you have this

16

configuration, you go up to the Supreme Court.

17

Supreme Court in Chadha says, of course, in addition to

18

the statute, there must be Article III case or

19

controversy, the presence of the congressional

20

intervenors here provides it.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER,

3

SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE

4
5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

6

This Court has jurisdiction in this case

7

based on the petition filed by the United States for the

8

same reasons it had jurisdiction in parallel

9

circumstances in Chadha and Lovett.

There are two

10

issues that have been -- that have been brought up this

11

morning and I'd like to address each in turn.

12

One is whether there's a concrete case or

13

controversy -- case or controversy in the sense of

14

adversity in this Court.

15

of whether there's Article III standing for the

16

government to bring this case before the Court.

17

And the second is the question

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

On the first one, is

18

there any case where all the parties agreed with the

19

decision below and we upheld appellate jurisdiction?

20

Any case?

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Where the parties agreed --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All the parties

23

agreed with the decision below and we nonetheless upheld

24

appellate jurisdiction.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, you didn't speak to

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it in Lovett, Your Honor, but that was the circumstance

2

in Lovett.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, it wasn't

4

raised -- it wasn't raised or addressed, and that had

5

the distinct situation of an appeal, direct appeal from

6

an Article I tribunal.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't -- I don't

8

know that that matters because you had to satisfy

9

Article III prerequisites to have the case in this

10

Court.

Now, Your Honor is, of course, correct that

11

the -- the Court didn't affirmatively engage on the

12

issue of jurisdiction, but that is a scenario --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So putting

14

Lovett aside, since none of this was discussed, is there

15

any -- any case?

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I don't know of one.

17

But these -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due

18

respect --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So this is totally

20

unprecedented.

21

never done before to reach the issue in this case.

22

You're asking us to do something we have

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Let me say two things about

23

that if I might, Your Honor.

24

unusual, but that's not at all surprising because the --

25

First is that it's -- it's

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it's totally

3

unprecedented in one respect, Your Honor.

4

at Chadha -- okay, the second point I'd make.

5

make one point at the outset, though, which is that

6

whether it's totally unusual or largely unusual, I grant

7

you that it doesn't happen.

8

happen is because -- I wouldn't confuse a numerator with

9

a denominator.

10

circumstances --

That's not -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But let me ask you,

suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts

6

about the practice of the President signing a bill, but

7

saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do

8

you call it, signing statements or something like that.

9

It seems to me that if we adopt your position that that

10

would ratify and confirm and encourage that questionable

11

practice because if the President thinks the law is

12

unconstitutional he shouldn't sign it, according to some

13

views.

14

It's very troubling.

15

And that's a lot like what you're arguing here.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I -- in the -- in the

16

signing statement situation, Your Honor, one example in

17

the past is Turner Broadcasting.

18

Broadcasting, that was a circumstance in which it was --

19

it was a veto, but in the course of the veto the

20

President made the determination that a particular

21

aspect of that statute was unconstitutional.

22

In Turner

And what happened as a result of that is

23

that the Department of Justice didn't defend that aspect

24

of the statute in litigation.

25

President reached a contrary conclusion.

Now, a subsequent

22

But -- but my

point is simply that when the President makes a

determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it can

litigation.

14

factor into it.

15

One of the considerations --

JUSTICE SCALIA:
It's the President's.

Excuse me.

It's not your

16

view.

It's only when the

17

President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can

18

decline to defend it?

19

thinks it's unconstitutional?

Or what if the Attorney General

20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, no.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or the Solicitor General,

22
23

Of course --

is that enough?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

28 U.S.C. 530(d)

24

presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going

25

to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended
23

because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that

2

it's unconstitutional.

3

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, it can be either the

Attorney General or the Solicitor General?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

It could be, but this is a

6

situation in which the President made the determination.

7

And when the President makes that determination, there

8

are a few considerations that I think would factor into

9

the mix in determining whether enforcement will follow.

10

One of them would be the consequences of enforcement for

11

the individuals who are affected.

12

And so, for example, I would assume that if

13

it's a criminal statute that we're talking about, an

14

enforcement would require criminal enforcement against

15

somebody and -- which would beget criminal sanctions.

16

That may be --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So when Congress enacts a

18

statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that

19

that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor

20

General, in his view, thinks it's unconstitutional?

it can happen also when -- in the rare instance in which

Congress knew that this would happen.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government sometimes

loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't

for purposes of statutory -- the statutory analysis at

III.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how are you aggrieved?

14

"Aggrieved" means that you are deprived of your legal

15

rights.

16

of your legal rights because your rights -- your

17

obligations under the Constitution supercede DOMA, and

18

you haven't been deprived of anything that you're

19

entitled to under the Constitution.

20

aggrieved?

21

And you don't think that you've been deprived

MR. SRINIVASAN:

So how are you

I guess we'd -- I'd

22

subscribe to the aggrievement analysis that the Court

23

made in Chadha at pages 929 to 931 of its opinion.

24

what the Court said is this:

all fours with the circumstances of this case.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

representing the Judiciary as you stand before us here

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

what I would say is this, the United -- the United

10

States -- the Executive Branch represents the sovereign

11

interests of the United States before the Court.

12

not -- I think the point of this is that it's not that

13

the Executive Branch is representing the Executive

14

Branch alone.

15

It's

The Executive Branch is representing the

16

sovereign interests of the United States.

interests would include the interests of the Congress

Why did Chadha leave it open

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't -- I don't know why

6

Chadha didn't engage on it in particular.

I think part

7

of it, Justice Kagan, is that the Court didn't have the

8

methodology at that point in time that it does now.

9

don't know that it neatly divided between those

10

questions in the same way.

So yes, it left the Article

III question open, but I think the question of Article

12

III injury necessarily follows from aggrievement and I

13

haven't -- I haven't heard a persuasive argument to the

14

contrary.

15

If we were aggrieved in the circumstances of

16

Chadha, it seems to me it necessarily follows that we're

injured.

Congress has been declared unconstitutional, which

language for the other side on this issue.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Let's go to

the BLAG issue.

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

So -- sure.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the issue wasn't

5

joined.

So what do you think we meant?

6

Justice Scalia doesn't care what you think we meant.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Right.

Well --

But what is your reading

of what that means, that Congress can --

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

And I know

I think that --- intervene in

situations in which its interests are injured?

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

So there are two

14

aspects of Chadha that are relevant on pages 939 and

15

940.

16

with prudential considerations that this Court ought to

17

take into account to make sure that it has a sufficient

18

adverse presentation of the competing arguments before

19

it.

The second discussion at page 940, I think, deals

20

And that's accounted for by an amicus type

21

role, and I think that's what the Court had in mind in

22

Chadha because the two cases that are cited in support

23

of that proposition were both cases in which there was

24

an appointed amicus.

25

aspect of Chadha.

So that -- that deals with that

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The other aspect of Chadha is the sentence

2

that I alluded to earlier.

And I guess I'm not -- I'm

3

not going to tell you that that sentence doesn't bear on

4

the issue at all, but I will say this, what's cited in

5

that sentence is 28 U.S.C. 1254.

6

So I think the point that was directly --

7

directly being made is that the House and Senate were

8

parties for purposes of the statute and they were

9

parties because they had intervened and so they had

10
11

party status.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

at most what it would say was in the unique

11

like Chadha, for example, you're right, it was the

13

2

And it -- there is a

presumption that its acts are constitutional.

That

presumption had real life here because when Congress was

5

considering this statute it asked the Justice Department

6

three times whether DOMA was constitutional, and three

7

times the Justice Department told them that it was in

8

fact constitutional.

9

that they at least have standing to have that

determination made by the courts, and this Court has

held that in the context of State legislatures and the

12

courts have --

13

So you don't think that

14

there is anything to the argument that in Chadha the

15

House had its own unique institutional responsibilities

16

and prerogatives at stake, either the one-house veto or

17

the legislative veto?

Well, I would say two things.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

That's irrelevant?

I don't think -- I don't think

I would say two things.

One is, I

22

don't think there was anything particularized about the

23

fact that it was the House that exercised the one-house

24

veto because the Court allowed the Senate to participate

25

as well.

And the Senate's interest in that was really
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

just the constitutionality of the legislation and

2

perhaps the one-house veto going forward.

3

But what I would say is I just -- I would

4

continue to resist the premise, which is that the

5

House's prerogatives aren't at stake here.

6

single most important prerogative, which is to pass

7

legislation and to have that legislation, if it's going to

if you disagree with -- the executive is defending one

12

of your laws, if that's the way you insist on viewing

13

it, and you don't like their arguments, you say, they

14

are not making the best argument.

15

in which you have standing to intervene to defend the

16

law in a different way than the executive is?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that a situation

No, I would say we would not,

18

Mr. Chief Justice.

I would say in that circumstance the

19

House would have the prerogative to file an amicus brief

if it wanted to.

21

prudential reason, which is when the Executive is

22

actually discharging its responsibility, its traditional

23

obligation to defend an Act of Congress, if Congress

24

comes in as a party it has the possibility of

25

second-guessing the way that they are actually defending

But that's because of a sound

it.

2

But if the Executive is going to vacate the

premises or, in a case like this, not just vacate the

4

premises, but stay in court and attack the statute, you

5

don't have that prudential concern.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's why what

How about a couple of cases

8

sort of in the middle of the Chief Justice's and this

9

one?

So let's say that the Attorney General decides

10

that a particular application of a statute is

11

unconstitutional and decides to give up on that

12

application.

13

decides that the application of the statute might be

14

unconstitutional, so decides to interpret the statute

15

narrowly in order to avoid that application.

16

Congress then come in?

17

Or even let's say the Attorney General

MR. CLEMENT:

Could

Well, I think -- if in a

18

particular case, which is obviously not this case, the

19

Executive decides, we are not going to defend the

20

statute as applied I think in that situation the House

21

could come in.

22

probably wouldn't.

23

I think as a matter of practice it

And it's not like the House and the Senate

MR. CLEMENT:

things, Justice Breyer.

12

I mean, I would point you to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Chadha is really different

14

because of course there is an interest in the

legislature in defending a procedure of the legislature.

the only interest I can see here is the interest in the

the 12 cases or whatever that what this Court has said,

4

without any special delegation of the power of the State

5

or Federal government to execute the law, without any

6

special delegation, a legislator simply has the power,

7

which a private citizen wouldn't have, to bring a

lawsuit as a party or defend as a party to vindicate the

interest in the law being enforced, the law he has voted

But think of
Where in all of

for?
Now I can imagine arguments on both sides,

12

so I'm asking you only, is there any case you can point

13

me to which will help?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

I can point to you a couple of

15

cases that will help, but may not be a complete solution

16

for some of the reasons you built into your question.

17

The cases I would point to help are Coleman v. Miller,

18

Karcher v. May, and Arizonans for Official English.

19

all of those -- I don't think Coleman involved any

20

specific legislative authorization, but you can

21

distinguish it, I suppose.

And

22

But in trying to distinguish it, keep in

23

mind that this Court gave those 20 Senators not just

24

standing to make the argument about the role of the

25

lieutenant governor, but also gave them standing to make
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the separate argument, which is the only one this Court

2

reached because it was divided four to four on the

3

lieutenant governor's role, the only issue that the

4

Court reached was the issue whether prior ratification

5

disabled them from subsequent legislation action, which

6

is just a way of saying what they did was

7

unconstitutional.

8
9

So I think Coleman is quite close.

Karcher,

Arizonans against English, there was an authorization.

be the same authority that has had the House appear in

23

here in H. Res. 5, which is the second place I would

point you.

25

That's the same authority that gave

authorized the BLAG to continue to represent the

there shouldn't be now.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the Senate on the other?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Kennedy, they

wouldn't have the standing to be on the other side of

you had happen in the Chadha case.

19

concerned about the argument and you say that the House

Why can't the Senate standing alone come into

45
Alderson Reporting Company

What -- Chadha

1

makes the critical flipping of the switch that gives the

2

House the ability to intervene as a party is that the

3

Executive Branch declines to defend the statute.

4

the Senate wants to come in and basically take -- share

5

argument time or something as an amicus, they can, but

6

there's no need for them to participate as -- as a

party.

15

It doesn't make sense to have the party that

Because whether the

actually defend these statutes --

2

MR. CLEMENT:

So if the Executive wants to

10

vindicate its role in our constitutional scheme by

11

saying, wait a minute, we passed that law, it can't be

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the law is passed

14

by a bare majority of one of the houses, then each

15

member of that -- of that house who was part of the

16

majority has the same interest in defending its

17

constitutionality.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think that's right

19

after Raines, Justice Alito.

In Raines, this Court

20

carefully distinguished between the situation of an

21

individual legislator and the situation of one of the

22

houses as a whole.

24

that's what you have here.

25

Chadha.

And it specifically said this might

That's what you had in

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

And again, I do think that -- I mean, the

2

only alternatives here are really to say that the

3

Executive absolutely must enforce these laws, and if

4

they don't, I mean because after all -- you know, I -- I

5

really don't understand why it's -- if they're not going

6

to -- if they've made a determination that the law is

7

unconstitutional, why it makes any sense for them to

8

continue to enforce the law and put executive officers

9

in the position of doing something that the President

10
11
12
13

has determined is unconstitutional.
I mean, think about the qualified immunity
implications of that for a minute.
So that's problematic enough.

But if

14

they're going to be able to do that and get anything

15

more than a consent judgment, then the House is going to

16

have to be able to play its role.

And it's going to

17

have to play the role of a party.

An amicus just

18

doesn't get it done.

19

the Executive gives the game away by conceding that our

20

participation as an amicus here is necessary to solve

21

what would otherwise be a glaring adverseness problem.

22

And I really think, in a sense,

Because once you recognize that we can

23

participate as an amicus, you've essentially recognized

24

that there's nothing inherently executive about coming

25

in and defending the constitutionality of an act of
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress.

Or more to the point, there's nothing

2

inherently unlegislative about coming in and making

3

arguments in defense of the statute.

4

And if that's critical, absolutely necessary

5

to ensure there's an adverse presentation of the issues,

6

well, there's no reason the House should have to do that

7

with one hand tied behind its back.

8

participation is necessary, it should participate as a

9

full party.

If its

And as I say, that's critically important

10

in the lower courts so they can take depositions, build

11

a factual record, and allow for a meaningful defense of

12

the statute.

Because the alternative really puts the

14

Executive Branch in an impossible position.

20

just want to say, the U.S. is asking this Court to tell

21

it to pay money.

22

It's not asking for relief.

Justice Sotomayor, you asked me about how

23

the issue could come up otherwise.

21

and inconsistent with this Court's approach in Summers

22

v. Earth Institute, and in the -- I think it was in the

23

plurality in Lujan, where you -- you -- if a party has

24

standing, they need to have it in the first court that

25

they're in, either when it starts or certainly before

judgment.

2

And the rule as Justice Sotomayor observed

3

just doesn't seem to say anything about authority to

litigate.

5

problem here is the injury being complained of is

6

inconsistent with the separation of powers.

7

I think that in addition, the -- the big

Bowsher and Buckley make very clear that

8

once the litigation is enacted, Congress's authority to

supervise it is at an end.

It goes over to the

Executive Branch.

19

if that set of attributes, one might well ask, what kind

20

of marriage is this?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

And I think the answer to

22

that, Justice Ginsburg, would be to say that that is a

23

marriage under State law, and I think this Court's cases

24

when it talks about the fundamental right to marriage, I

25

take it to be talking about the State law status of

marriage, and the question of what does that mean for

2

purposes of Federal law has always been understood to be

3

a different matter.

4

number of situations under a number of statutes, so it's

5

simply not the case that as long as you are married

6

under State law you absolutely are going to be treated

7

as married --

9

And that's been true certainly in a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
thing?

How about divorce?

Same

That you can have a Federal notion of divorce,

10

and that that doesn't relate to what the State statute

11

is?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, we've never had that,

13

Your Honor, and I think that there is a difference when

14

it comes to divorce because with divorce uniquely, you

15

could have the -- possibility that somebody's married to

16

two different people for purposes of State law and

17

Federal law.

18

But with the basic question of even whether

19

to recognize the marriage -- or probably the best way to

20

put it is just whether the Federal law treats you as

21

married for a particular purpose or not, there always

22

have been differences between the Federal law treatment

23

and the State law treatment.

24
25

The Federal treatment, for example,
recognizes common law marriages in all States whereas a
57
Alderson Reporting Company

lot of States don't recognize common law marriages, but

Federal law recognizes that for some purposes -- the

And -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But only if the State

MR. CLEMENT:

for purposes of that provision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is a common

law, Federal common law definition?
MR. CLEMENT:

That's my understanding,

that's -- as discussed -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought it was

14

reverse, that if the State law recognized common law

marriages, the Federal law --

MR. CLEMENT:

My understanding is that there

is a Federal -- that the Federal law recognizes in -- in

the Social Security context even if it doesn't.

context, tax consequences.

22

consequences, the State may well recognize that divorce.

23

The Federal government has long said, look, we are not

going to allow you get a divorce every December just to

25

get remarried in January so you have a filing tax

And in

efforts, and I do think for purposes of the federalism

issue, it really matters that all DOMA does is take this

6

term where it appears in Federal law and define it for

7

purposes of Federal law.

8

radically different case if Congress had, in 1996,

9

decided to try to stop States from defining marriage in

10

a particular way or dictate how they would decide it in

11

that way.

12

It always has its own

It would obviously be a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it applies to over

13

what, 1,100 Federal laws, I think we are saying.

14

it's not -- it's -- it's -- I think there is quite a bit

15

to your argument that if it's a tax deduction case, which

16

is specific, whether or not if Congress has the power it

17

can exercise it for the reason that it wants, that it

18

likes some marriage it does like, I suppose it can do

19

that.

20

So

But when it has 1,100 laws, which in our

21

society means that the Federal government is intertwined

22

with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at -- at

23

real risk of running in conflict with what has always

24

been thought to be the essence of the State police

25

power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody.
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, two

2

points.

First of all, the very fact that there are

3

1,100 provisions of Federal law that define the terms

4

"marriage" and "spouse" goes a long way to showing that

5

Federal law has not just stayed completely out of these

6

issues.

7

contexts where there is an independent Federal power

8

that supported that.

It's gotten involved in them in a variety of

9

Now, the second thing is the fact that DOMA

10

affects all 1,100 statutes at once is not really a sign

11

of its irrationality.

12

all it has ever purported to be, is a definitional

13

provision.

14

Dictionary Act, what it does is it defines the term

15

wherever it appears in Federal law in a consistent way.

16

And that was part and parcel of what Congress was trying

17

to accomplish with DOMA in 1996.

18

It is a sign that what it is, and

And like every other provision in the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but it's not really

19

uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of

20

marriage.

21

It doesn't regulate all of marriage.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that's true but I don't

22

think that's a mark against it for federalism purposes.

23

And it -- it addressed a particular issue at a point,

24

remember in 1996, Congress is addressing this issue

25

because they are thinking that the State of Hawaii,
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

through its judicial action, is about to change the

2

definition of marriage from a way that it had been

3

defined in every jurisdiction in the United States.

4

what that meant is that when Congress passed every one

5

of the statutes affected by DOMA's definition, the

6

Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the

7

traditional definition.

8
9

And

And so Congress, in 1996, at that point
says, the States are about to experiment with changing

10

this, but the one thing we know is all these Federal

11

statutes were passed with the traditional definition in

12

mind.

13

rational for Congress then to say, well, we are going to

14

reaffirm what this word has always meant for purposes of

15

Federal law.

16

And if rational basis is the test, it has to be

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose we look just at the

17

estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which

18

provides specially favorable treatment to a married

19

couple as opposed to any other individual or economic

20

unit.

21

that really to foster traditional marriage, or was

22

Congress just looking for a convenient category to

23

capture households that function as a unified economic

24

unit?

25

What was the purpose of that?

MR. CLEMENT:

Was the purpose of

Well, I think for these
61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purposes actually, Justice Alito, if you go back to the

2

beginning of the estate tax deduction, what Congress was

3

trying to do was trying to provide uniform treatment of

4

taxpayers across jurisdictions, and if you look at the

5

brief that Senator Hatch and some other Senators filed,

6

they discussed this history because what was happening,

7

in 1948 when this provision was initially put into

8

Federal law, was you had community property States and

9

common law States, and actually there was much more

10

favorable tax treatment if you were in a community law

11

State than a common law State.

12

And Congress didn't want to have an

13

artificial incentive for States to move from common law

14

to community property.

15

same way no matter what State they were in.

16

we will give a uniform Federal deduction based on

17

marriage, and I think what that shows is that when the

18

Federal government gets involved in the issue of

19

marriage, it has a particularly acute interest in

20

uniform treatment of people across State lines.

21

It wanted to treat citizens the

the perspective that Congress is passing this not in a

The second and complementary authority is

MR. CLEMENT:

helping the States in the sense of having each sovereign

Mr. Clement, for the most

6

that the Federal government was pursuing.

7

suggests that maybe something -- maybe Congress had

8

something different in mind than uniformity.

9

So this was a real difference in the uniformity
And it

So we have a whole series of cases which

10

suggest the following -- which suggest that when

11

Congress targets a group that is not everybody's

12

favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases

13

with some -- even if they're not suspect -- with some

14

rigor to say, do we really think that Congress was doing

15

this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that

16

Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by

17

animus, and so forth?

18

I guess the question that this statute

19

raises, this statute that does something that's really

20

never been done before, is whether that sends up a

21

pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

A couple of responses, Justice

23

Kagan.

First of all, I think I would take issue with

24

the premise, first of all, that this is such an unusual

25

Federal involvement on an issue like marriage.
72
Alderson Reporting Company

If you

Official

1

look at historically, not only has the Federal

2

government defined marriage for its own purposes

3

distinctly in the context of particular -- particular

4

programs, it's also intervened in -- in other areas,

5

including in-State prerogatives.

6

reason that 4 State constitutions include a prohibition

7

on polygamy.

8

on them.

9

Civil War and in Reconstruction, Congress specifically

10

wanted to provide benefits for spouses of freed slaves

11

who fought for the Union.

12

I mean, there's a

It's because the Federal Congress insisted

There is a reason that, in the wake of the

In order to do it, it essentially had to

13

create State law marriages because in the Confederacy,

14

the slaves couldn't get married.

15

their own State -- essentially, a Federal, sort of,

16

condition to define who was married under those laws.

17

So where there have been needs in the past to get

18

involved, the Federal government has gotten involved.

19

So they developed

The other point I would make -- but I also

20

eventually want to get around to the animus point -- but

21

the other point I would make is, when you look at

22

Congress doing something that is unusual, that deviates

23

from the way they -- they proceeded in the past,

24

you have to ask, well, was there a good reason?

25

sense, you have to understand that, in 1996, something's
73
Alderson Reporting Company

And in a

Official

1

happening that is, in a sense, forcing Congress to

2

choose between its historic practice of deferring to the

3

States and its historic practice of preferring

4

uniformity.

5

Up until 1996, it essentially has it both

6

ways, every State has the traditional definition.

7

Congress knows that's the definition that's embedded in

8

every Federal law.

9

Okay.

10

Well, is what happened in

1996 -- and I'm going to quote from the House Report

collective moral judgment and to express moral

14

disapproval of homosexuality."

15

Is that what happened in 1996?

We've switched now from Federal power to

It could

In that

instance, the Federal government wouldn't be purporting

to say who is married and who is not married, it would

12

MR. CLEMENT:

That would make no difference,

13

Justice Alito.

14

demonstrates, though, that when the Federal government

15

is defining this term as it appears in the Federal Code,

16

it is not regulating marriage as such.

premises of this, which is we are at somehow rational

basis-plus land because I would suggest strongly that

12

three levels of scrutiny are enough.

13

But in all events, if you are thinking about

14

the justifications that defend this statute, that

justify the statute, they are obviously in the brief.

But it's uniformity -- but it's not -- it's not just

17

that Congress picked this -- you know, we need a uniform

18

term, let's pick this out of the air.

They picked the traditional definition that

whatever States can do in terms of recognizing

marriage or not recognizing marriage, the Federal

government has commensurate authority to do or not do.

We don't think that's right as a matter of our equal

protection analysis because we don't think the Federal

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I take you back to the

example that you began with where a member of the

10

military is injured.

So let's say three soldiers are

11

injured and they are all in same-sex relationships, and

12

in each instance the other partner in this relationship

13

wants to visit the soldier in -- in a hospital.

14

The first is a spouse in a State that allows

same-sex marriage, the second is a domestic partner in a

16

State that an allows that, but not same-sex marriage,

17

the third is in an equally committed loving relationship

admitted -- should be admitted, but the other two would

85
Alderson Reporting Company

The only way in

which -- that BLAG's arguments for its -- for the

Your -- your position seems to me,

should be treated the same.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, the question before

12

the Court is whether the exclusion that DOMA imposes

13

violates equal protection, and it does violate equal

14

protection because you can't treat this as though it

15

were just a distinction between optometrists and

16

ophthalmologists, as the Lee Optical case did.

discrimination here is being visited on a group that has

historically been subject to terrible discrimination on

20

the basis of personal --

same in the example that he just gave you, that

discrimination would have been visited on the same

purposes of State law and the exclusion is a result of

do it.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, I have

15

a question.

You think, I think from your brief

16

17

orientation should be looked at on an intermediate

18

standard of scrutiny?

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
All right, heightened in

21

some way.

Going back to the Chief's question about a

22

law that was passed recognizing common law

23

heterosexual -- homosexual marriages.

24

under your theory that might be suspect because -- that

25

law might be suspect under equal protection because once
87
Alderson Reporting Company

I think even

Official

1

we say sexual orientation is suspect, it would be

2

suspect whether it's homosexual or heterosexual.

3

law favors homosexuals, it would be suspect because it's

4

based on sexual orientation.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The

You would have -- you

6

would have to impose the -- the heightened scrutiny

7

equal protection analysis, sure.

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.

And so when we

decided race was a suspect class, people who are not
blacks have received --

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, that's certainly --- strict scrutiny on

13

whether the use of race as a class, whether they are

14

white or a black, is justified by a compelling interest.

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That -- that is certainly

16

true, Your Honor.

17

BLAG has actually identified as supporting this statute,

18

I think there are -- there are -- I think that you can

19

see what the problem is here.

20

If I could turn to the interest that

Now, this statute is not called the Federal

21

Uniform Marriage Benefits Act; it's called the Defense

22

of Marriage Act.

23

24

administration of Federal benefits.

25

equally uniform systems, the system of respecting the

State choices and the system of -- that BLAG is

2

advocating here.

satisfy equal protection scrutiny is justify the choice

5

between one and the other.

6

the two is that the Section 3 choice is a choice that --

7

Section 3 choice is a choice that discriminates.

it's not simply a matter sufficient to say, well,

uniformity is enough.

10

And the difference between

Section 3 discriminates.

And so

And

with respect --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So as soon as one

12

State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of

13

marriage throughout the Federal code had to change?

14

Because there is no doubt that up until that point every

15

time Congress said "marriage" they understood they were

16

acting under the traditional definition of marriage.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I don't know,

18

Mr. Chief Justice, why you wouldn't assume that what

19

Congress was doing when it enacted a statute,

20

particularly a statute that had the word "marriage" in

21

it, was assuming that the normal rule that applies in

22

the vast majority of circumstances of deference to the

23

State definition of marriage would be the operative

24

principle.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
89
Alderson Reporting Company

So you don't think

Official

1

that when Congress said "marriage" in every one of these

2

provisions that they had in mind same-sex marriages?

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, but they may well

4

have had in mind deferring to the normal State

5

definition of marriage, whatever it is.

6

were making the specific choice that my friend suggested

7

they were.

enacted DOMA that choice of exclusion has to be

9

justified under appropriate equal protection principles.

10

Not that they

But whatever is the case, when Congress

And so the issue of uniformity just doesn't

11

get you there because there is no uniformity advantage

12

to Section 3 of DOMA as opposed to the traditional rule.

13

The issue of administration doesn't get you there.

14

mean, at a very basic level administrative concerns

15

ought not be an important enough interest to justify

16

this kind of a discrimination under the Equal Protection

17

Clause.

18

I

But even if you look at them, there are no

19

genuine administrative benefits to DOMA.

20

DOMA -- Section 3 of DOMA makes Federal administration

21

more difficult because now the Federal government has to

22

look behind valid State marriage licenses and see

23

whether they are about State marriages that are out of

24

compliance with DOMA.

25

If anything,

It's an additional administrative burden.
90
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So there is no administrative -- there is no

2

administrative advantage to be gained here by what -- by

3

what Congress sought to achieve.

4

reality of it is, and I think the House report makes

5

this glaringly clear, is that DOMA was not enacted for

6

any purpose of uniformity, administration, caution,

7

pausing, any of that.

8

And the fundamental

It was enacted to exclude same-sex married
-- lawfully married couples from Federal benefit regimes

based on a conclusion that was driven by moral

11

disapproval.

12

the pages of the House report which we cite on page 38

13

of our brief --

14

It is quite clear in black and white in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that was the view

15

of the 84 Senators who voted in favor of it and the

16

President who signed it?

17

They were motivated by animus?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

We quoted our -- we quoted the Garrett concurrence in

19

our brief.

20

that it may well not have been animus or hostility.

21

may well have been what Garrett described as the simple

22

want of careful reflection or an instinctive response to

23

a class of people, or a group of people who we perceive

24

as alien or other.

25

And I think there is a lot of wisdom there,
It

But whatever the explanation, whether it's
91

animus, whether it's that -- more subtle, more

2

unthinking, more reflective kind of discrimination,

3

Section 3 is discrimination.

5

excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from

6

Federal benefits, cannot be reconciled with our

7

fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law.

And I think it's time for

This is discrimination in its most very

9

basic aspect and the House Report, whether -- and I

10

certainly would not suggest that it was universally

11

motivated by something other than goodwill -- but the

12

reality is that it was an expression of moral

13

disapproval of exactly the kind that this Court said in

15

Yes, Your Honor, and

Federal government's not in the same position because as

11

BLAG concedes, the Federal government at the most can

12

act at the margins in influencing these decisions about

13

marriage and child rearing at the State level.

14

Second Circuit and the First Circuit both concluded that

15

there's no connection at all, and that's of course

16

because Section 3 doesn't make it any more likely that

17

unmarried men and women in States that -- unmarried men

Whatever the issue is, with -- whatever the

16

outcome is with respect to States and marriage, that the

attenuated that two Federal courts of appeals have seen

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTA A. KAPLAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT WINDSOR

MS. KAPLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

1

please the Court:

2

I'd like to focus on why DOMA fails even

3

under rationality review.

4

thousands of people who are legally married under the

5

laws of nine sovereign States and the District of

6

Columbia are being treated as unmarried by the Federal

7

government solely because they are gay.

8
9

Because of DOMA, many

These couples are being treated as unmarried
with respect to programs that affect family stability,

10

such as the Family Leave Act, referred to by Justice

11

Ginsburg.

12

for purposes of Federal conflict of interest rules,

13

election laws, and anti-nepotism and judicial recusal

14

statutes.

These couples are being treated as unmarried

15

And my client was treated as unmarried when

16

her spouse passed away, so that she had to pay $363,000

17

in estate taxes on the property that they had

18

accumulated during their 44 years together.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I ask you the

same question I asked the Solicitor General?

Do you think there would be a problem if

We don't care whether you

It has certainly been argued in

this case by others that -- whether or not that's in the

enumerated powers of the Federal government.

reasons Justice Kagan mentioned, we think the federalism

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's just -- all

4

these statutes use the term "marriage," and the Federal

5

government says in all of these statutes when it says

6

marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the

7

State acknowledges them to be married or not.

that would work because they wouldn't --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me get to the

question I asked Mr. Clement.

14

word "marriage," takes it out of the U.S. Code

MS. KAPLAN:

Yes.

Surely it

That would not be based

on the State's --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

"marriage"?

22

term "marriage"?

So it's just the word

And it's just the fact that they use this

23

MS. KAPLAN:

Well, that's what the Federal

24

government has always chosen to do.

25

the Federal law is structured, and it's always been
99
Alderson Reporting Company

And that's the way

Official

1

structured for 200 years based on the State police power

2

to define who's married.

3

presume, could decide to change that if it wanted, and

4

somehow, it would be very strange for all 1,100 laws,

5

but for certain programs -- you have different

6

requirements other than marriage, and that would be

7

constitutional or unconstitutional depending on the

8

distinction.

9

The Federal government, I

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if the estate tax

10

follows State law, would not that create an equal

11

protection problem similar to the one that exists here?

12

Suppose there were a dispute about the -- the State of

13

residence of your client and her partner spouse.

14

it New York, was it some other State where same-sex

15

marriage would not have been recognized?

16

there was -- the State court said the State of residence

17

is a State where it's not recognized.

Was

And suppose

18

Would -- would you not have essentially the

19

same equal protection argument there that you have now?

20

MS. KAPLAN:

Well, let me -- let me answer

21

that question very clearly.

Our position is only with

22

respect to the nine States -- and I think there are two

23

others that recognize these marriages.

24

client -- if a New York couple today marries and moves

25

to North Carolina, one of which has a constitutional
100
Alderson Reporting Company

So if my

Official

1

amendment, a State constitutional amendment -- and one

2

of the spouses dies, they would not -- since estate

3

taxes determine where the person dies, they would not be

4

entitled to the deduction.

5

That is not our claim here.

6

Moreover, Justice Alito, in connection with

7

a whole host of Federal litigation, there has been

8

Federal litigation for hundreds of years with respect to

9

the residency of where people live or don't live, or

10

whether they are divorced or not divorced throughout the

11

Federal system.

12

handled that and has never before -- and we believe this

13

is why it's unconstitutional -- separated out a class of

14

married gay couples solely because they were gay.

15

And the Federal government has always

JUSTICE ALITO:

Just -- if I could follow up

16

with one -- one question.

17

hypothetical surviving spouse, partner in North

18

Carolina, brought an equal protection argument, saying

19

that there is no -- it is unconstitutional to treat me

20

differently because I am a resident of North Carolina

21

rather than a resident of New York.

22

would that be discrimination on the basis of sexual

23

orientation?

24

Would it survive?

25

What if the -- the

What would be --

What would be the level of scrutiny?

MS. KAPLAN:

That would be certainly a
101

Alderson Reporting Company

1

different case.

2

think you heard yesterday than the case that we have

3

today.

4

discrimination should get heightened scrutiny.

5

doesn't get heightened scrutiny, obviously, it'd be

6

rational basis, and the question would be what the State

7

interests were in not allowing couples, for example, in

8

North Carolina who are gay to get married.

9

It'd be more similar to the case I

We certainly believe that sexual-orientation
If it

No one has identified in this case, and I

10

don't think we've heard it in the argument from my

11

friend, any legitimate difference between married gay

12

couples on the one hand and straight married couples on

13

the other that can possibly explain the sweeping,

14

undifferentiated, and categorical discrimination of

15

DOMA, Section 3 of DOMA.

16

And no one has identified any legitimate

17

Federal interest that is being served by Congress's

18

decision, for the first time in our nation's history to

19

undermine the determinations of the sovereign States

20

with respect to eligibility for marriage.

21

respectfully contend that this is because there is none.

I would

clear, DOMA was enacted to defend against the marriages

like to know the reason.

MS. KAPLAN:

Of course.

stay out of it.

Section 3 of DOMA is not staying out of

23

it.

Section 3 of DOMA is stopping the recognition by

103

what it's doing is undermining, as you can see in the

2

briefs of the States of New York and others, it's

undermining the policy decisions made by those States

7

controversies, they're resolved in those States.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, the -- the

discriminations are not the sexual orientation, but on a

It's a class of married couples

who are gay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I pose the same

22

question I posed to the General to you.

23

there's a difference between that discrimination and

24

this -- and the discrimination of States who say

different cases.

between those classes.

6

the issues would be in those States would be what

interest the States have, as opposed to here, what

8

interest -- and we think there is none -- the Federal

9

government has.

10

I think when you have couples who are

11

question of why Congress singled out gay people's

12

marriages for disrespect through DOMA.

13

be uniformity as we've discussed.

savings because you still have to explain then why the

15

cost savings is being wrought at the expense of married

16

couples who are gay.

17

interests that weren't discussed, but questions of

18

family law in parenting and marriage are done by the

19

States, not by the Federal government.

20

The answer can't

It can't be cost

And it can't be any of the State

The only -- the only conclusion that can be

21

drawn is what was in the House Report, which is moral

22

disapproval of gay people, which the -- Congress thought

23

was permissible in 1996 because it relied on the Court's

24

Bowers decision, which this Court has said was wrong,

25

not only at the time it was overruled in Lawrence, but
105
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

was wrong when it was decided.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So 84 Senators --

3

it's the same question I asked before.

4

based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?

5

MS. KAPLAN:

84 Senators

No, I think -- I think what is

6

true, Mr. Chief Justice, is that times can blind, and

7

that back in 1996 people did not have the understanding

8

that they have today.

9

there is no constitutionally permissible distinction --

10

That there is no distinction,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, does that

11

mean -- times can blind.

12

base their votes on moral disapproval?

13

MS. KAPLAN:

Does that mean they did not

No, some clearly did.

I think

14

it was based on an understanding that gay -- an

15

incorrect understanding that gay couples were

16

fundamentally different than straight couples, an

17

understanding that I don't think exists today.

18

that's the sense I'm using that times can blind.

19

think there was -- we all can understand that people

20

have moved on this, and now understand that there is no

21

such distinction.

bigotry, I think it was based on a misunderstanding on

gay people and their --

effectiveness of people representing, supporting your

22

Mr. Chief Justice, I think the sea change has to do,

understanding that there is no difference -- there was

tell, political figures are falling over themselves to

endorse your side of the case.

15

MS. KAPLAN:

The fact of the matter is,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, is that no other group in recent

17

history has been subjected to popular referenda to take

18

away rights that have already been given or exclude

19

those rights, the way gay people have.

20

those referenda have ever lost.

don't think that the political power of gay people today

certainly is analogous -- I think gay people are far

4

weaker than the women were at the time of Frontiero.

the case.
MS. KAPLAN:

To flip the language of the

12

House Report, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it comes from a

moral understanding today that gay people are no

14

different, and that gay married couples' relationships

15

are not significantly different from the relationships

16

of straight married couples.

17

I don't think --

understanding came from, if not the political

ADVISORY GROUP OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

just three points in rebuttal.

13

First of all, I was not surprised to hear

the Solicitor General concede that there is no unique

15

federalism problem with DOMA because in the Gill

16

litigation in the First Circuit, the State of

17

Massachusetts -- the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

18

invoked the Tenth Amendment, and on that issue the

United States continued to defend DOMA because there is

no unique federalism problem with it, as the Chief
