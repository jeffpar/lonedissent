CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 11-564, Florida v. Jardines.

5

Mr. Garre.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In the three prior cases in which this Court

10
11

has held that a dog sniff is not a search, this Court

12

has emphasized that a dog sniff is unique, both in terms

13

of the manner in which information is obtained and the

14

nature of the information revealed.
As to the latter point, this Court has

15
16

emphasized that a drug detection dog reveals only the

17

presence of contraband, and that no one has a legitimate

18

expectation of privacy in that.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, that just can't be

20

a proposition that we can accept across the board.

21

Nobody under that view has an interest in contraband in

22

their home.

The question is, can you find out the

23

contraband?

It's just a circular argument.

24
25

And if -- and in the -- was it the Caballes
case that talked about that, if I have the right name?
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That was where the contraband was visible; it was almost

2

like the smoking gun falls out.

3

there's no interest in the smoking gun when it falls out

4

in front of you.

5

Well, of course,

So I just don't think that works.

MR. GARRE:

Well, Justice Kennedy, in the

6

Caballes case, the contraband wasn't visible before the

7

dog alerted.

8
9

In the home case, we're not saying that you
don't have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the

10

home.

Of course, you do.

11

have a legitimate expectation --

12

The question is whether you

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So doesn't that mean

13

that what's in your home that's not visible to the

14

public has an expectation of privacy as well?
MR. GARRE:

15
16

Your Honor.

17

Not when it comes to contraband,

And we think that the Kyllo case helps -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that -- that is

18

circular.

19

you have no expectation of privacy in the contraband,

20

why bother even with a search warrant?

21

Then why do you need a search warrant?

MR. GARRE:

If

Because, Your Honor, when you

22

have a search warrant and you go into a home, there's

23

going to be a lot of private information that you're

24

going to come across, even if your expectation is

25

finding evidence of a crime.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Garre, does your

2

argument mean -- you say minimally intrusive, and that

3

the dog will detect only contraband, that the police

4

then are to go into a neighborhood that's known to be a

5

drug dealing neighborhood, go into -- just go down the

6

street, have the dog sniff in front of every door, or go

7

into an apartment building?

8
9

Is that -- I gather that that is your
position.
MR. GARRE:

10

Your Honor, they could do that,

11

just like the police could go door to door and then

12

knock on the doors and hope that they will find out

13

evidence of wrongdoing that way.

14

But the two responses this Court has always

15

pointed to is the restraint on resources and the check

16

of community hostility.

17

Here, the police were combatting a serious

18

epidemic of grow houses, hundreds of houses each year

19

that were a scourge to the community, not only in terms

20

just of the drugs that they were growing --

21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose the

house had on the lawn, no dogs allowed?

23

MR. GARRE:

I think that would be different,

24

Your Honor.

It would be -- and that's a way in which

25

the house is different than a car.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Homeowners can

Official

1

restrict access to people who come up to their front

2

door by putting gates or a sign out front.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's right.

4

And there's such a thing as what is called the curtilage

5

of a house.

6

As I understand the law, the police are

7

entitled to use binoculars to look into the house if --

8

if the residents leave the blinds open, right?

9
10

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if they can't see

11

clearly enough from a distance, they're not entitled to

12

go onto the curtilage of the house, inside the gate, and

13

use the binoculars from that vantage point, are they?

14

MR. GARRE:

They're not, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't it the same thing

16

with the dog?

This dog was brought right up -- right up

17

to the -- to the door of the house.

18

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, first of all, I

19

think that, as this case comes to the Court, the police

20

were lawfully present at the front door.

21

established by the courts below, and we don't think that

22

they've challenged it here.

23

That was

That's at least true with respect to the

24

police officer.

The police officer could go up to the

25

front door and knock and detect the smell of marijuana,
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just like Officer Pedraja did.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then we've taken an

3

unrealistic case, if that has been conceded, because it

4

seems to me crucial that this officer went onto the

5

portion of the house that -- as to which there is

6

privacy, and -- and used a means of -- of discerning

7

what was in the house that -- that should not have been

8

available --

9
10

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think the way you

would --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. GARRE:

-- in that space.

I think the way that you would

13

answer that question, Your Honor, is, of course, there's

14

a curtilage that extends around the house and protects,

15

in which the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of

16

privacy.

17

It's well established, we think, going back

18

to the common law, that there is an implied consent for

19

people, visitors, salesmen, Girl Scouts,

20

trick-or-treaters, to come up to your house and knock on

21

the door --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but not implied

23

consent for the policeman to come up with the dog.

24

only purpose of the dog is to detect contraband.

25

So you can say, yes, there's an implied

invitation to the Girl Scout cookie seller, to the

2

postman, even to the police officer, but not police

3

officer with dog, when the only reason for having the

4

dog is to find out if there's contraband in the house.

5

MR. GARRE:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of

6

all, I think, if the Girl Scout or the salesman or the

7

trick-or-treater brought up a dog with them, there would

8

be complied consent for that too, at least as long as

9

the dog was on a leash.

10

I don't think the subjective --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

This is a drug detecting dog.

13

MR. GARRE:

This is not any dog.

No, that's right.

But I don't

14

think it changes the subjective purpose of why they

15

brought the dog with them.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why is that an implied

17

consent?

18

cities that I've lived in, you have to have a dog on a

19

leash.

20

allergic to animals, you don't want dogs walking around

21

at your door.

22

That's a huge assumption.

And you don't give implied consent.

MR. GARRE:

If you're

Well, you can certainly put the

23

"No Dogs Allowed" sign out front.

24

would not be implied consent.

25

MR. GARRE:

I mean,

No, I think -- and certainly

15

this is true in my neighborhood, Your Honor, is

16

neighbors can bring their dog up on the leash when they

17

knock on your front door, and I think that's true in

18

most neighborhoods in America.

19

Homeowners that don't like dogs and want

20

them off their property have a way to combat that, and

21

that's putting a fence around it to say, no dogs --

There are certainly houses that have that.

Isn't it fair just to

And I think -- Your Honor, I

10

think the reason why that doesn't work here is that if

11

you ask that question with respect to the officer, I

think it's well settled or accepted that police officers

13

can walk up the front path, absent a sign or something,

14

knock on the door -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

does that include them coming up and -- up to your porch

4

it's not permitted.

5

MR. GARRE:

If the purpose of the police

6

officer here, for example, was to walk up to the house,

7

hope that they answered the door, or hope that once they

8

were up there, that they would smell the odor of

marijuana, as Officer Pedraja did, that would not

10

convert it into a search.

11

physical invasion.

12

There was no invasion,

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true, but if you're

13

looking at expectation of a reasonable homeowner,

14

imagine you have a home, a long driveway.

15

people to come up and come into the house, knock on the

16

door, maybe even with dogs.

17

there for 5 to 15 minutes, 15 minutes, not knocking on

the door, doing nothing?

Well, I think everyone accepts

4

when someone comes to your door, they can avail

5

themselves of their God-given senses, whether it's

6

looking into a window without binoculars,

7

taking -- breathing in and smelling the air, as Officer

8

Pedraja did.

expectation of people coming into your door, perhaps

the front step with the binoculars.

Now, why is that unconstitutional?

Because

18

it's very unusual that someone would do that, and a

19

homeowner would resent it.

20

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would a homeowner resent

22

someone coming with a large animal sitting in front of

23

the front step on his property and sitting there

24

sniffing for 5 to 15 minutes?

25

Forget the sniffing.

Just talking, loud

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

noises.

Is that something that you invite people to do?

2

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, what I think you can

3

say there is implied consent to is a dog accompanying a

4

person on a leash walking up to the front door, taking a

5

sniff in a matter of seconds, not minutes --

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's not what the

record says, Mr. Garre.
JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

Is that what happened

here?

8
9

Ah.

I thought what happened

here was 5 to 15 minutes.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, the record suggests

13

that he put the dog on a very long leash, the dog goes

14

back and forth, tries to figure out where the smell is

15

coming from.

16

It's not just -- you know, my first thought

17

was you go up to the door, the dog barks once, and

18

that's it.

19

for some extended period of time, going back and forth

20

and back and forth, trying to figure out where the

21

greatest concentration of the smell is.

22

But you read the record, this dog is there

It actually seemed, from my reading of the

23

record, to be, you know, a lengthy and obtrusive

24

process.

25

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, I think what the
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

record shows is, is that the dog was on the scene, i.e.,

2

at the curb, walking up, going back into the car, and

3

then leaving, for a total of 5 to 10 minutes.

4

Walking up to the front steps, sniffing,

5

alerting and leaving is a matter of seconds or minutes.

6

It's not -- the dog isn't up there for 5 to 10 minutes.

7

It happens very quickly.

8
9

I think in thinking about reasonable
expectations of privacy, it is important to keep in mind

10

physically what's happening in these houses.

11

people are growing drugs in the houses with the aid of

12

electricity and light and heat.

13

need air conditioning in order to control the heat.

14

These

And they need -- they

And that air conditioning is blowing a very

15

strong odor of drugs out into the public, and the people

16

know that.

17

because they use mothballs, which Officer Pedraja found

18

here at the front of the house, outside of the house.

19

They know that.

We know they know that

And so what you're talking about, although

20

we talk about what's going on in the home, really what's

21

happening here is odor of illegal contraband is being

22

blown out into the street and someone is coming up to it

23

and using their God-given senses in a way that humans

24

and dogs have used for centuries and detecting that.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, we've had a

Official

1

lot of -- we've had a lot of discussion about whether

2

it's 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whether it's mothballs.

3

I understood the issue before us to be whether or not

4

under the Fourth Amendment it is a search for a dog to

5

come up to the door and sniff, not with respect to --

6

we're not making a judgment, I thought, on the probable

7

cause in light of the totality of the circumstances, but

8

the ground of decision below was this is a search when

9

the dog sniffs.
MR. GARRE:

10
11

That you need probable cause

just for the dog to sniff.

12

No, that's absolutely right.

And the dog sniff itself clearly is not a

13

physical invasion in the same way that looking is not a

14

physical invasion under the common law.

15

think --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the dog, we

It isn't just the sniffing

17

in the abstract.

18

sniffing at a person's front door, right?

19

It's the sniffing at this point, the

MR. GARRE:

I mean --

Well, that's true, Your Honor,

20

but I think if it wasn't a search for the police officer

21

to walk up there and sniff and report smelling live

22

marijuana, then it wasn't a search when Franky walked up

23

there and alerted to the presence of an illegal

24

narcotic.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I didn't say it

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wouldn't be a search if the police officer himself did

2

that if he went there with the intention of -- of

3

smelling at the door.

4

he shouldn't be on the curtilage to search.

5

He's going there to search, and

MR. GARRE:

I think it's been conceded in

6

this case, at least it was below, that the officer could

7

walk up there, knock on the door, report the smell of

8

marijuana, and that that was not a search.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Garre, this is what we

10

said in Kyllo.

11

"We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology

12

any information regarding the interior of the home that

13

could not otherwise have been obtained without physical

14

intrusion into a constitutionally protected area

15

constitutes a search, at least where, as here, the

16

technology in question is not in general public use."

17

And I'm just going to read it.

So what part of that do you think separates

18

your case from this one?

19

that language does not apply in this case?

20

We said,

MR. GARRE:

In other words, what part of

Well, first of all, Franky's

21

nose is not technology.

22

availing himself of God-given senses in the way that

23

dogs have helped mankind for centuries.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

It's -- he's using -- he's

So does that mean that if we

invented some kind of little machine called a, you know,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

smell-o-matic and the police officer had this

2

smell-o-matic machine, and it alerted to the exact same

3

things that a dog alerts to, it alerted to a set of

4

drugs, meth and marijuana and whatever else, the police

5

officer could not come to the front door and use that

6

machine?

7

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, I think the

8

contraband rationale would be the same.

9

different in that you don't have technology in this

10

It would be

case.

11

And I think that's an important distinction

12

because, as we read Kyllo, the Court was very concerned

13

about advances in technology, and that's just not true

14

for a dog's nose.

15
16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So your basic distinction is

the difference between like a machine and Franky.

17

MR. GARRE:

Well --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That we should not

19

understand Franky as kind of a sense-enhancing law

20

enforcement technology, but we should think of him as

21

just like a guy.

22

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, I think that's true

23

for two reasons.

One is Franky is using the same sense

24

of smell that dogs have used for centuries.

25

isn't a case where if you allow a dog to sniff today, he
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

might use x-ray vision in the future.

2

to happen.

3

That's not going

And the other thing is that Franky -- that

4

the use of dogs for their sense of smell, which everyone

5

agrees is extraordinary, mankind has been using them for

6

law enforcement type purposes for centuries.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not this -- not this

8

purpose.

You said centuries, but I think you recognize

9

that it wasn't until the seventies when the dogs were

10

used to find culprits.

11

think it was only since the seventies.

12

MR. GARRE:

But to use it in this way I

detection purposes, that's right.

15

back before the founding.

The fact is today they're looking for
drugs in this context, but -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Garre, there's no

21

dispute that dogs can smell what human beings can't; is

22

that correct?

23

put it on a human being to enhance their sense of

24

smells; dogs can do something human beings can't.

25

It's not that we can find a machine to

MR. GARRE:

They have a much better sense of

smell, that's right.

But I think if you look at --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

like a guy, to think that he is not like technology in

4

terms of augmenting what a human being can do.

MR. GARRE:

He's substituting what a human

He's -- the dogs, no doubt, have

an enhanced sense of smell compared to the officer.

I think that's really not functionally different than

12

using an airplane to look into the house, like in

13

Florida v. Reilly.

14

And in that sense, I think this case

In Florida v. Reilly, the officers used a

19

being pumped out of the house into the street.

20

But

Here, you're using the drug

And the people who use the house know that.

21

They know that, and we know they know that because the

22

mothballs were present.

23

Mothballs are a masking agent.

People don't have a legitimate expectation

24

of privacy, this Court has held, in things that they

25

knowingly expose to the public, even in the home.

That's what the Court said in Florida v. Reilly.

It's

And I think, here, one way to resolve it is

out into the street because of the air conditioning that

7

they need to run the grow houses, there is no invasion

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,

16

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17
18
19
20

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to go right to two points that

21

respond to the Court's questions.

The first is the

22

question of whether the officer and the dog were

23

lawfully in place, whether they could approach the front

24

door, was conceded below.

25

case comes to this Court, that is not an issue before

And, as the court -- as the

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Court.

2

has --

3

And I want to make sure that the Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I didn't -- I didn't

4

understand the concession to be that the police had come

5

to the door with the dog, the sole purpose of the dog

6

being to detect contraband.

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, let me give the Court

8

specific citations on that.

The court of appeals, the

9

Florida Court of Appeals, found that the dog and the

10

officer were lawfully in place.

11

105, 112, 116 and 120.

12

That's JA pages 104,

Before the Florida Supreme Court at oral

13

argument, Respondent conceded that there was no

14

reasonable expectation of privacy in the porch, and the

15

Florida Supreme Court accepted that concession.

16

Petition Appendix page 31, also noted by the dissent in

17

pages 78 to 79.

18

That's

In the brief in opposition to cert,

19

Respondent said that the police could approach the front

20

door for a knock and talk, and made no separate argument

21

about the dog's presence there making it not lawful.

22

So as this case comes to the Court, it is

23

with the dog and the officer lawfully in place at the

24

front door, approaching the front door just like any

25

Girl Scout, trick-or-treater, or anyone else could.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And just to respond, Justice Ginsburg, to

2

the questions that you raised, the police officer's

3

purpose in approaching the front door does not mean that

4

the officer can't come to the door.

5

in many contexts that officer purpose doesn't matter,

6

and it doesn't matter if the officer is looking for a

7

lost child or thinking that that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Court has said

You're agreeing with

Mr. Garre that the police could take a dog and go down

10

every house on the street, every apartment in the

11

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, assuming that the

13

police can lawfully be in the place that they are going

14

with the dog, which is conceded here -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

If they are approaching the

18

front door using the normal path, because the dog only

19

detects contraband, yes, they could be used in those

20

circumstances, but that's not happening.

21

There have been justices who've warned about
that -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are restraints on

There's the potential for community

If you look at the cases that have arose in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This Court has dealt with

an item that was seized before, a piece of luggage, a

10

car.

They have not dealt with the dog sniff in the

11

context of a home that's not seized.

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

But in Caballes, where

13

admittedly the Court did not decide this specific issue,

14

it distinguished the case of Kyllo as saying that that

15

was finding out about lawful activity in the home, and

16

that a person -- the critical distinction between Kyllo

17

and the dog sniff in Caballes is that a person does not

18

have a reasonable expectation of privacy in contraband.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just -- again, as I told

20

Mr. Garre, I just can't accept that as the premise for

21

the case.

22

is a reasonable expectation in society generally,

23

whether or not the police because of limited

24

resources are not going to have -- that's all fine.

25

this idea that, oh, well, if there is contraband,

The argument we're having about whether there

Official

1

then all the -- all the rules go out the window, that's

2

just circular, and it won't work for me, anyway.

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I wanted to be sure to

4

respond to that, Justice Kennedy, because I would hate

5

for the Court to have the impression that all the rules

6

go out the window.

7

That's not the case.

What we're talking about here is a

8

sniff that would allow the police to go to a detached

9

and neutral magistrate to say that, we have probable

10

cause --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Fine --

-- to get a warrant.
-- but don't ask me to

14

write an opinion and say, oh, we're dealing with

15

contraband here, so we don't need to worry about

16

expectation of privacy.

17

that because Caballes cited Jacobsen, and Jacobsen was

18

where the contraband fell out of the package and it was

19

in plain view.

20

me, in this case.

21

There is simply no support for

So that just doesn't work, at least for

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, the reasoning in

22

contraband -- in Jacobsen, though, the Court said that

23

the rationale, the reason for its decision in Place, is

24

because when you're talking about people's reasonable

25

expectations of privacy, they have both a subjective and
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

an objective component.
So it's not just that you want to keep

3

something private; it's that you need to have a

4

legitimate expectation that you can keep that private.

5

And the Court has said over and over, in Place, in

6

Caballes, in Jacobsen, that you do not have a legitimate

7

expectation with respect to contraband.

8

That doesn't mean that the --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Again, I don't think the

10

cases go that far because those were cases in which the

11

contraband -- Jacobsen -- was in plain view.

12

knows that it falls out of the package.

13

you don't have any --

14

Everybody

At that point,

What you're saying is, oh, well, if there is

15

contraband in the house, then you have no legitimate

16

expectation of privacy.

17

That, for me, does not work.

MS. SAHARSKY:

What we're trying to say,

18

Justice Kennedy, is not that you lack any privacy

expectation in the home.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How does what you're saying,

2

Ms. Saharsky, square with Karo?

Because in Karo, the

3

only thing that the beeper alerted to in the home was

4

the can of ether, which was clearly an item that was

5

being used for drug manufacture.

6

else other than that item, which you might not call it

7

contraband, but it was evidence of illegality, this can

8

of ether.

9

anything else.

And there was nothing

There was no thought that it was used for
And that was the only thing that the

10

beeper alerted it to; and, yet, nonetheless, we said,

11

you know, of course that's a search.

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that my answer

13

touches on the point that you made, which is it was not

14

contraband.

15

evidence of a crime, but the Court did not say it was

16

contraband.

17

The police thought that it might be

18

oral argument, where defense counsel made very clear

19

that ether has many lawful uses.

different from what the Court considered in Place.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That makes it
This

Well, not lawful uses in

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, with respect,

Your Honor, the defense counsel I think correctly

like.

7

various lawful uses of ether in a house.

He actually had an expert that came to the

9

So I think, as the argument came to the
Court, the government was not making an argument that

10

that was contraband or evidence of a crime.

11

government was just saying, oh, it's very limited

12

information, because we had already -- we had already

13

tracked the ether to the house, so you weren't finding

14

out much.

15

The

And the Court said basically what it said in

16

Kyllo, which is, it might not be much, but it's still

17

about lawful information, activity in the house, and

18

that's protected.

19

But in Caballes, the Court came back and

20

said, sure, we've said Kyllo, lawful activity in the

21

house, but your interests in protecting contraband are

22

different; those are not legitimate interests.

23

Court has said that again and again and again.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the

But in Kyllo -- and I think

this was what Justice Kennedy was saying.

In Kyllo,

1

there was already a seizure that had happened, and the

2

Court just said, this is no -- this is really no greater

3

an intrusion.

4

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, with respect, when we

5

look at the -- when we look at the language in these

6

cases, in Caballes and the like, you know, the Court

7

wasn't saying, oh, it's not a search because this has

8

already -- this had already been seized and nothing more

9

was happening.

10

The Court said it was not a search

because there is no legitimate expectation of privacy.

11

And just to be clear, the question about

12

whether folks have a reasonable expectation of privacy

13

with respect to contraband in their house has to take

14

into account two facts:

15

about contraband; but, also, that dogs have been

16

used and known for centuries for their sense of smell.

17

First, that we're only talking

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but I -- what I'm

18

curious about, and it's an unanswered question for me,

19

is we are considering whether the dog sniff is

permissible, so I wanted to know what a dog sniff at the

21

front door involves.

That they were -- that they

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD K. BLUMBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MR. BLUMBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Police officers taking a narcotics detection

18

dog up to the front door of a house is a Fourth

19

Amendment search for two distinct and separate reasons.

20

First, when police reveal any details inside

21

a home which an individual seeks to keep private, that

22

is a Fourth Amendment search and that is exactly what a

23

narcotics detection dog is doing, revealing details in

24

the home the individual seeks to keep private.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's your first reason

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and I don't want you to be deterred from giving us the

2

second, but if we can concentrate on that for a minute.

3

That seems to me a proposition that's

4

equally unacceptable to what the government is saying,

5

that you have no interest in contraband.

6

often, when they have ordinary conversation with people,

7

want to find out the details of what that person is

8

doing, where the person lives, what goes on in the

9

house.

The police

"Hello, have you had a nice time at the --

10
11

at the park today?

12

children; is this where you live?"

13

conversation that we always have in order to try to find

14

out what people are doing, what they are like, where

15

they live.

16

you repeated it quite accurately from what you have at

17

page 16 of your brief -- just goes too far.

18

decisions "establish that police action which reveals

19

any detail an individual seeks to keep private is a

20

search" -- that is just a sweeping proposition that in

MR. BLUMBERG:

under your hypothetic that he knowingly left the blinds

open.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He certainly wanted to keep

it -- he wanted to keep it private.

7

MR. BLUMBERG:

Well, certainly; and the

8

defendant in Reilly wanted to keep the marijuana

9

private.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Well, you could say the

11

same thing here.

They wanted to keep private the fact

12

that they were growing the marijuana, but they -- they

13

used a means of suppressing the heat that made it

14

impossible to keep it private.

15

MR. BLUMBERG:

Well, that --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. BLUMBERG:

They were careless.
I -- I don't believe there is

18

anything in the record to indicate that the air

19

conditioner was blowing the smell of marijuana out from

20

the house in a very strong manner.

21

fact --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. BLUMBERG:

As a matter of

There were the mothballs.
There were mothballs there,

24

and Detective Bartelt, the dog handler that was standing

25

at the front door as well, testified without

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

contradiction or without hesitation he didn't smell

2

anything.

3

So if -- if Mr. Garre's representation about

4

an air conditioner basically blowing the smell of

5

marijuana outside the house so that anybody would smell

6

it --

7
8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What were the

mothballs there for?

9

MR. BLUMBERG:

The mothballs presumably were

10

there to -- to mask the smell of an odor coming from the

11

house.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. BLUMBERG:

14

Okay, then --

It's manifesting an

expectation of privacy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Well, that's my

16

question.

17

privacy in the marijuana or the expectation of privacy

18

in the odor?

19

Are we talking about the expectation of

MR. BLUMBERG:

The expectation of privacy on

20

the -- in the details, what's going on inside your

21

house.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- well, no,

23

that can't be right, because if you're letting smoke out

24

that -- that -- I don't know, from the burning of a body

25

or something, you don't say, well, because he's trying
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to conceal that you can't rely on the smoke.

2
3

MR. BLUMBERG:

But that's knowingly

exposing what's inside the house.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I guess the

5

question here is, if you appreciate the fact that the

6

odor is coming out to the extent that you're going to

7

put mothballs all around the house, it seems to me that

8

you -- you may have an expectation of privacy in the

9

marijuana plants, but you don't have an expectation of

10

privacy in the odor, because you're emitting it out, out

11

into the world, and it's the odor that was detected.

12

MR. BLUMBERG:

But assuming that's what the

13

mothballs were there for, that's to keep the odor inside

14

the house, so that the public cannot find -- cannot

15

detect that odor, unless you go up there --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's like saying

17

you put the -- the drugs in a -- in a bag to protect

18

them from observation on the outside, but you use, you

19

know, a clear bag rather than a, you know, opaque one or

20

something.

21

And -- when you began you said assuming that's what the

22

mothballs were there for.

23

for, isn't it?

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think your first

4

reason is -- is so broad, it is clearly incorrect.

5

so broad, you ought to go on to your second reason.

6
7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, I was going to

ask for your second, your second point.

8
9

It's

MR. BLUMBERG:

Well, the -- when a police

officer takes a narcotics detection dog up to the front

10

door of the house, that is also a Fourth Amendment

11

search because that is a physical trespass upon the

12

constitutionally protected area of the curtilage of the

13

home.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

You know, we've had hundreds

15

of years of trespass cases in this country and in

16

England.

17

holding that it is a trespass for a person with a dog to

18

walk up to the front door of a house?

19

MR. BLUMBERG:

Has there -- do you have a single case

Well, there are cases that go

20

back to the -- I'm sorry, I don't have the, the

21

citations -- but there are cases in the 1700s that

22

established that basically a dog running on to someone

23

else's property is a trespass.

That really wasn't my

question, was it?

MR. BLUMBERG:

I thought your question

was if a dog comes on to private property --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

If a dog on a leash is

brought up to the front door of a person's house, was

5

that a trespass at the time when the Fourth Amendment

6

was adopted?

Katz the rule has been whether the homeowner has a

38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BLUMBERG:

My response to that is that

2

does violate the resident's reasonable expectation of

3

privacy.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then the question was,

5

as Justice Alito put it, why?

He says, we go back to

6

the 17th century, as far as you want, and there is no

7

law that says there is any kind of expectation in a

8

homeowner that a person won't walk up to the dog -- to

9

the door with a dog on a leash and sniff, which, as he

10

says -- which your opponents say is what happened here.

11

And your response to that is?

12

MR. BLUMBERG:

My response to that is that

13

any entry onto private property in the 1700's was a

14

trespass, was the tort of trespass, unless it was with

15

consent.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about, Mr. Blumberg,

petition, 104 and 105.

22

number of times.

23

The court said, the officer and

MR. BLUMBERG:

24

Justice Ginsburg.

What I -- what I said in the Florida

25

coming up by himself without the dog to knock on the

2

front door and talk to the homeowner.

3

conceded that would not be a violation of a reasonable

4

expectation of privacy, and this Court has stated as

5

much in Kentucky v. King.

6

And I said that I

And then the Court said to me, what's the

7

difference?

8

what I'm saying here.

9

And I said the dog.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

And that's exactly

So that's

10

clearly -- you do concede if the police officer walks up

11

to the door, smells it himself, no problem there; is

12

that right?

13

MR. BLUMBERG:

If the police officer is

talk, yes; but, if the police --

So just like, you know, your neighbor with

2

his Cockapoo walks up to your door all the time, that's

3

what this police officer has done.

4

MR. BLUMBERG:

Why do you win then?

Well, whether it's a Cockapoo

5

or Franky, who, from all the pictures, appears to be a

6

very cute dog, it's not what the dog looks like, it's

7

what the dog is doing on the front porch, which is --

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The dog does what your

neighbor's dog does.
MR. BLUMBERG:

10

Well, no, this dog -- the

11

neighbor's dog does not search for evidence on your

12

front porch.

13

That's the key distinction.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, Mr. Blumberg, I think

14

you're, with respect, misguided to concede that if it

15

was just the officer alone without the dog, it would be

16

perfectly okay.

MR. BLUMBERG:

I did not mean to concede

that, and I was going to say that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you just

10

said it depends on whether or not he's going up to the

11

door to sniff or going up for something else.

12
13

MR. BLUMBERG:

It depends what the officer

does at the front door, not what his state of mind is.

14
15

If the officer goes up to the front door and
starts sniffing around the cracks and crevices --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, sure, if he's

goes up there and does sniff --

He doesn't intend to sniff

he smells the marijuana.

Is that a search?

And it's fine to say -- I

It is relevant in that context.

the door to sell tickets to the Policeman's Ball, that's

15

fine.

If he's going on to conduct a search, that's

2

crime, and the bloodhound -- and they used the

5

a trespass?

have.

And what's the case that

says that?
MR. BLUMBERG:

Well, the -- I do not have a

11

case that says that taking a bloodhound up to the front

12

door of a house would be a trespass.

13

it under the definition of what a trespass is, it's an

14

unlawful entry onto private property without consent of

15

the homeowner.

But if you analyze

And there is no --

Right.

back in the 1700's, impliedly consented to police coming

21

up to the front door of his house with a bloodhound,

22

even though everybody knew they could do that.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, are there cases that

24

say that the implied consent exists only where the

25

person is coming to the door for a purpose that the
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

homeowner would approve, if the homeowner knew the

2

purpose of the person coming to the door?

3

MR. BLUMBERG:

The specific doctrine is

implied consent by custom.

it customary for people to accept in terms of people

6

coming onto their property.

7

And so you look to what is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How is that different from

what Justice Breyer I think correctly indicated, our

inquiry as to whether there is a reasonable expectation

10

of privacy?

11

12

there isn't.

doctrines are very similar.

Let me ask this.

I know what your answer would be.

Suppose the policemen

21

have little microphones on so they can talk into their

22

radio, the microphone on their lapel.

23

24

microphone in his lapel on so his partner can hear the

It doesn't occur to him

MR. BLUMBERG:

But, again, when you talk to

the police officer, that's a reasonable possibility.

10

You don't have -- that's not a reasonable expectation of

11

privacy, that if you talk to a police officer, that that

12

might be going out to another police officer that's in

13

the car down the street.

But there's no -- a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

A police -- there's implied

12

consent for a police officer to go up to the front door,

13

knock on the door and attempt to engage the person in

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is

18

possibly engaging in criminal conduct to come to your

20

and attempt to get incriminating information out of you,

21

would most people say, yes, I consent to that?

22

If you took a poll of people and said do you

MR. BLUMBERG:

In terms of consent?

Again,

it's implied consent by custom.

Absolutely.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

differently, that there is an implied consent for your

11

neighbor to bring the dog up for anyone else but a

12

police officer.

implied consent for anyone else or there is no implied

14

consent, period?

15

Is that what you're saying?

MR. BLUMBERG:

There's an

I think a strong argument can

be made that there is no implied consent for anyone to

4

pointed out, that a homeowner has a reasonable

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

between dogs that are not drug detection dogs and

8

ordinary dogs.

9

between a police officer who is not expert at detecting

Would you draw the same distinction

the smell of methamphetamine and a police officer who is

11

expert at detecting the smell of that drug?

the factual, I don't believe that -- that what happened

15

here in terms of the use of the drug detection dog took

16

5 to 15 minutes.

17

certainly took, I would say, at least 1 or 2 minutes,

18

because what happened -- and again, this is on 96, 97

19

and 98 -- the officer goes from the street over the

20

curb, up to the front door of the house, with the dog

21

basically dragging him up to the front door of the

22

house.

23

It didn't take 5 to 15 minutes.

They go up this walkway -- and a picture of

1

right in front of the house.

And once he gets in that

2

area, the dog starts violently bracketing back and

3

forth, pulling on the leash.

4

that the other officer had to stay back, because it was

5

so violent that people could get knocked down by what's

6

happening.

The dog handler testified

7

And for a period of time the dog goes back

8

and forth, back and forth, and then at some point goes

9

to the crack on the bottom of the front door, sniffs

10

that, and then the process finally stops, he sits down.

11

So that's factually what happened.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Blumberg, the

13

Florida appellate court, yes, the court of appeals, did

14

say that that the officer and the dog were lawfully

15

present.

16

But you say you didn't make that concession.
MR. BLUMBERG:

Well, that's -- I did not

17

make that concession and -- no, I certainly did not

18

concede that, but the court found that.

point I wanted to make.

Maybe this is the

So what if there is

Is it -- is it -- is it wrong for them

to a determination that there was a trespass because

I don't --- that if they select

somebody with a sense of smell because they have gotten

a tip of drugs in a house, that we give up, in that

12

situation, the assumption that they went to investigate?

MR. BLUMBERG:

No.

this Court to adopt does not rely on the subjective

15

intent of the police officer.

question what that officer is doing.

question presented here, it is a trespass.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought the reason -- I

that it is a search if it was a trespass.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

With respect to state law,

21

State v. Morsman, 394 So.2d 408 at 409, this was a case

22

that came up during oral argument in the Supreme Court.

23

expectation of privacy in a porch, taking into account

We know that they knew about that because

the --

that the odors were outside the house.

call it a technology, call it whatever you want to call

21
