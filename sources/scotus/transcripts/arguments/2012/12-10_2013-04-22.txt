Mr. Srinivasan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

Congress's comprehensive program to address

13

the worldwide problem of HIV and AIDS includes a policy

14

of opposing prostitution and sex trafficking because

15

they contribute to the diseases' spread.

16

correspondingly, Congress determined -- determined that

17

the government should partner with and should grant

18

limited competitive Federal funding to those

19

organizations that agree with the policy opposing

20

prostitution and sex trafficking because organizations

21

that agree with that policy are most likely to carry out

22

the Federal program in conformity with the Federal

23

policy priorities.

24
25

And

Now, no organization that carries out HIV
programming is required to subscribe to the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 4

1

government's views, but, if an organization wants to

2

partner with the Federal government and get Federal

3

funds to carry out the Federal program, well, that

4

organization --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I guess

6

the problem is that there are a number of different ways

7

you could carry out the program.

8

an organization that focuses on a particular -- you

9

know, the administration of hospitals or whatever it is

And let's say you have

10

that's covered by the program, and they regard this

11

issue as collateral to what they're concerned with.

12

There -- there have to be some limitations

13

on what type of loyalty oath you can require them to

14

sign, isn't there?

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, the way that Congress looked at this

17

was to look at -- at the organizations with which the

18

government is going to partner across the mine run of

19

situations, and I think what one can do is look at

20

Respondents' brief because Respondents encompass a

21

variety of different types of organizations.

22

But Respondents' brief itself tells you, at

23

pages 11 to 12 and at pages 32 and 33, that there are

24

going to be situations, in their own experience, in

25

which these issues about prostitution and --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 5

1
2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
they --

3
4

Well, what if

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- and sex trafficking come

into issue.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

What if they're not?

I appreciate that.
What if the government

7

has, in addition to this policy, a strong policy in

8

promoting -- you know, recycling, and so they require

9

everybody with whom they're going to do business, every

10

grantee, to adopt a policy in favor of using renewable

11

resources?

Any problem with that?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

13

that would present a different question.

14

know that it presents a different question, but it would

15

be a little bit more difficult for the -- for the

16

following reason:

17

to Congress's -- the constitutionality of Congress's

18

funding decisions in this area.

19

and the less germane the condition would be, the more

20

it's open to constitutional attack.

21

Mr. Chief Justice, I think
Of course, you

That there is a germaneness component

And the more sweeping

Now, this condition is very, very germane

22

because as -- because, as Congress found, prostitution

23

and sex trafficking contribute to the spread of the

24

disease, and so it makes good sense that Congress would

25

have imposed this condition.

And I think it's important

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 6

1

to understand --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -- well, on that

3

particular point, what should we do -- as far as I can

4

tell from the briefs, the people who work with the

5

prostitutes to try to prevent AIDS uniformly tell us

6

that, if you go to those prostitutes and you try to get

7

them to take steps to stop AIDS, it's very hard to do

8

if, at the same time, you've announced you're against

9

all prostitution.

10

So what they're saying is that the condition

11

imposed will interfere with the objective, and if there

12

is a germaneness requirement -- and nobody says the

13

opposite.

14

saying in terms of the effectiveness of their work,

15

so -- I don't think.

16

I mean, I've noted nobody denies what they're

At least, I didn't read them all with great

17

care; maybe you can point to somebody who does.

18

everyone is telling us that this is counterproductive

19

and the exact opposite -- then can we say, well, it

20

isn't germane?

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But, if

Well, Justice Breyer, I

22

don't think so, and two responses on that score.

23

of all, everybody is not telling you that, and I'll tell

24

you who's not telling you that in a second.

25

First

But the more -- but the overarching point is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 7

1

that this is a policy determination that Congress, of

2

course, took into account when it fashioned the statute,

3

and it concluded that it was important to have an

4

opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking.

5

Now, as far as the organizations that aren't

6

telling you that, there is an amicus brief that's filed

7

by 46 organizations that it's in our support --

8
9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:
yes.

Well, that's quite a few,

That's true.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- that's in our support,

11

and the lead organization is the Coalition Against

12

Trafficking in Women, and they -- they support us, and

13

they think that the best way -- and they -- and they

14

argued this passionately in their brief -- they think

15

that the best way to provide services to the target

16

audience is under a rubric of opposition to prostitution

17

and sex trafficking.

18

And I would urge you to take a look at that

19

brief because it explains why the program should be

20

conducted in this fashion.

21

Now, is there a debate about --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Srinivasan, there

23

isn't -- at least I'm not familiar with anything quite

24

like this, where, if you're not told, if you want to run

25

a government program, you have to speak the government's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8

1

speech.
This doesn't require the recipient to speak

2
3

to anybody at all, except to the government itself, to

4

say, I pledge that my policy is the government's policy.

5

So it's making somebody adopt, as her own, the

6

government's policy, rather than saying, I understand

7

that I get my government money, I have to follow the

8

government's rules about what I can say to the public.

9

Here -- and is -- is there anything else

10

quite like this, where you make a pledge to the

11

government, but with respect to third parties doesn't

12

apply?

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Ginsburg, if I

14

could just fight the premise of your question just very

15

slightly and then explain why I think this kind of

16

requirement makes sense in this particular context?

17

The goal of this is not to persuade somebody

18

to change their view.

19

with organizations that self-identify as organizations

20

that agree with the government's policy priorities.

21

the reason the government has done that and the reason

22

why Congress couldâ€™ve thought that that was a good idea is

23

straightforward, and that is that those organizations

24

that agree with Congress's policy priorities are going

25

to be more likely to be reliable and effective partners

The goal of this is to partner

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official
Page 9

1

in carrying out the government's program.

2

And one way to think about it is to envision

3

this:

4

your last few dollars of a discretionary Federal

5

funding, and you're looking at two different

6

organizations that are competing for that money.

7

You have a circumstance in which you're down to

One of them comes to you and says, we agree

8

with your policy of an opposition to prostitution and

9

sex trafficking; and the other one says, we're not going

10

to tell you whether we agree, we're going to remain

11

studiously neutral, but we'll tell you that we'll

12

conduct our affairs in a manner that's not inconsistent

13

with your policy priorities.

14

I think it makes all the sense in the world

15

for Congress to decide that the government should

16

preferably partner with the former organization, rather

17

than the latter, because they're going to be more

18

reliable and more effective at carrying out the

19

government's program.

20

And there's another aspect of this that I

21

think that is important to highlight, and that is that

22

we're not just talking about circumstances in which the

23

conduct is -- is, arguably, going to be neutral, so that

24

there's going to be no position taken.

25

There's also going to be occasions in which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 10

1

the organizations that are providing services are going

2

to have the opportunity to affirmatively embrace the

3

government's policy in opposition to prostitution and

4

sex trafficking.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm not aware of any case in

6

which this Court has held that it is permissible for

7

Congress to condition Federal funding on the recipient's

8

expression of agreement with ideas with which the

9

recipient disagrees.

10

I'm not aware of any case in which

that kind of compelled speech has been permitted.

11

And I would be interested in -- and it seems

12

to me like quite a -- a dangerous proposition.

I would

13

be interested in whatever limitations you think there

14

might be on that rule, which seems to be the general

15

rule that you're advocating.

16

of germaneness, is there anything else?

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Other than the requirement

There -- there is

18

germaneness, Justice Alito, and I can point to a couple

19

of other limiting principles that have been noted in

20

this Court's decisions and I think that are satisfied

21

here.

22

One is that Finley talked about -- and I

23

think it captures some other decisions in this -- this

24

respect, disallowing the government from leveraging its

25

control over funding conditions in a manner that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 11

1

services a speech-suppressive objective.

2

have to be careful, and I think this maps --

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so you

Say it again.

I didn't

understand the point.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It -- it -- the government

6

is limited from leveraging its control over funding

7

conditions, so that it can achieve a speech --

8

speech-suppressive objective.

9

And I think what the Court was getting at is

10

that you want to be careful that the speech condition --

11

the speech-related condition is tightly tethered to the

12

programmatic objective and not allow the government

13

to -- to have the program seep into other areas where it

14

doesn't have to go.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me give you this

16

example, which is mentioned in one of the amicus briefs.

17

The government provides lots of funding to universities

18

to -- in various forms, either directly or through

19

student loans, in the form of tax exemptions, so

20

anything that would be germane to the general purpose of

21

higher education, presumably, could be attached as a

22

condition to those funds.

23

Would that be correct?

24

MR. SRINIVASAN:

25

limitations.

With -- with certain

I mean, I think germaneness is a -- is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 12

1

criterion.

2
3

JUSTICE ALITO:

With what -- with what

limitations?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think -The government could have a

6

whole list of things -- of principles that it thinks

7

should be incorporated into higher education, and it

8

could require a university, as a condition of receiving

9

these -- this money, let's say directed through student

10

loans, to express agreement with all of these

11

propositions.

12

Would that be true?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I -- well, I'm not

13

sure, Justice Alito, and of course it's going to be hard

14

for me to decide that we are not going to defend

15

something.

16

that's out there, which is that I think there is an

17

important distinction between circumstances in which the

18

government is partnering with an organization to carry

19

out a government program and circumstances in which the

20

government is extending a Federal subsidy to an

21

individual organization as kind of an across-the-board

22

entitlement.

23
24
25

But let me just give you a limiting idea

So in the generally applicable
across-the-board -JUSTICE SCALIA:

What do you mean by,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 13

1

"partnering"?

2

partnering differ from just giving them the money to do

3

the job?

4

How does this partnering differ --

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't know that it

5

the differs from giving the money to do the job.

6

guess what I'm saying is there are going to be

7

circumstances, for example, like in Speiser, where the

8

financial question doesn't have to do with the

9

expenditure of the money by the recipient in a manner

10

I

that's commensurate with congressional goals.

11

In that context, you're giving a generally

12

applicable entitlement, and you're not so worried about

13

how the money is being spent because that person is not

14

partnering with the government in carrying out a Federal

15

program.

16

the government in carrying out the Federal program

17

because it's the Federal HIV program that's --

18

Here, the organizations are partnering with

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know what you --

19

what do you mean by, "partnering"?

You're just saying

20

they are given money to carry out a particular program.

21

Is that all --

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that all you mean by,

24
25

"partnering"?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

They are given money to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 14

1

carry out --

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To carry out a particular

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But in concert with Federal

program?

4
5

policy priorities, so it's not just -- it's not just a

6

naked grant of money.

7

Justice Scalia, for example, let's just consider your

8

classic entitlement --

9

If you had an entitlement,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand.

It is -- it

10

is a naked grant of money to implement a particular

11

program.

12
13

MR. SRINIVASAN:
program and --

14
15

To implement a particular

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

And you call that

"partnering with the Federal government"?

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I do.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Terrible verb, anyway.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Okay.

20

that.

21

in carrying out a Federal program.

22

My apologies for

For associating with the organization recipient

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Srinivasan, on this,

23

what does seem to me unusual, as Justice Alito brought

24

out, requiring somebody to say, "I believe this" or "I

25

agree with the government on that."

Alderson Reporting Company

The Rust v.

Official
Page 15

1

Sullivan, which is one of the precedents on which you

2

rely, made it a point that the doctor was not required

3

to represent -- as his own views, not required to

4

represent an opinion that he doesn't hold.

5

He has to adhere to the government's program

6

in his dealings with the public, but he doesn't have to

7

say, "I agree with the government."

8
9
10

MR. SRINIVASAN:
Ginsburg.

Yes.

That's true, Justice

But here's why -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that just an

11

irrelevant consideration in Rust, that no one -- no one

12

was being obliged to say, I believe something, that they

13

don't believe?

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, here's why I think it

15

makes sense in this context -- it is distinct in that

16

respect, but here's why I think it makes sense in this

17

specific context:

18

an ex ante commitment from the organizations with which

19

the government works to assure that they agreed with the

20

government's policy priorities.

21

What Congress wanted to do is secure

Now, where these programs are carried out is

22

in the main, in foreign territory, in distant lands,

23

and, in that context, I think Congress would have

24

understood that monitoring of conduct can be

25

particularly challenging.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

1

And that monitoring is made all the more

2

challenging because these issues can come into play

3

through a myriad of interactions between the

4

organizations that are working with the government and

5

the local communities and local officials.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that, and I see you

7

have two sides to the policy question.

8

seems to me that the case that Justice Ginsburg was

9

speaking of is pretty relevant.

Why?

And then it

Well, that case,

10

Regan and League of Women Voters, all seem quite

11

comparable.

12

They are trying to balance the -- the desire

13

of the government to further a policy objective with the

14

undesirability of the government invading what would

15

otherwise be a constitutional protected right to speech.

16

And the way they have done it is quite

17

technical and narrow, but it may be applicable.

In

18

both, what they said was, don't worry about your

19

protected speech as much as you are because there is

20

another way you can do it here.

21

independent structured organization.

22

wasn't present, namely, the League of Women Voters, the

23

Court struck it down.

You go through a -- an
And where that

24

Now, if that's the right framework, then,

25

here, I don't see how you could have an independently

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 17

1

structured organization for the reason that a group that

2

said, I am -- I am opposed completely to prostitution,

3

publicly, to get the money, and then set up a structure

4

that said the opposite, would be seen as totally

5

hypocritical.

6

message across.

7

They wouldn't be able to get their

They wouldn't be able to express, in any

8

way, what it is they think about the -- the

9

administration of AIDS in the context -- anti-AIDS in

10
11
12

the context of prostitution.
That's a long question, but you see
where -- where I've ended up.

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think I do.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

At the moment, for purposes

15

of the question.

16

League of Women Voters and less like the other two?

17

So why isn't this case more like

MR. SRINIVASAN:

For the following reasons,

18

Justice Breyer:

There is an alternative affiliated

19

organizational vehicle in this case as well, and I think

20

that's constitutionally significant.

21

to quibble with Your Honor's point about how the

22

organization that's the funding recipient has made this

23

policy agreement and that that can have ripple effects.

Now, I'm not going

24

But here's why that matters:

25

having an alternate vehicle is not that it remedies a

Alderson Reporting Company

The point of

Official
Page 18

1

constitutional problem that already exists.

2

of it is to get to this leveraging purpose that I was

3

talking about earlier, and it's to show that what the

4

government is doing is keeping the condition within its

5

appropriate confines, and it's not allowing that

6

condition to spread beyond that, into other realms.

7

And that purpose is fully served by the

8

organizational affiliate alternative here.

9

it's important --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The point

And I think

But, Mr. Srinivasan,

11

there is a difference in this international setting --

12

you know, most of those separate affiliates was in

13

Taxation Without Representation, and it was the cure for

14

the Legal of Women Voters.

15

District Court said in its opinion, which was in your

16

favor, oh, all you have to do is spin off a subsidiary

17

that gets the government money; it's just a simple

18

matter of corporate reorganization.

19

But here, as the D.C.

But you know that getting an NGO -- a new

20

NGO recognized in dozens of foreign countries is no

21

simple thing to accomplish.

22

example, look what happened about a year and a half ago

23

in Egypt, when the U.S. NGOs were indicted for

24

criminal -- for not complying with the permit

25

requirements of the country.

I mean, to take a concrete

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 19

1

So it's one thing to set up a 501(c)(3) and

2

501(c)(4) operating in the United States, each does its

3

thing.

4

where it's operating, get the necessary permits is quite

5

an arduous thing.

6

But to require an NGO to then, in the countries

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

7

guess it depends on which direction it runs as a

8

principal point.

9

organization that's been conducting the program, to

10

date, can continue to conduct the program, and the

11

affiliate that's set up could be the alternate channel.

12

And so you could run in the opposite direction, and I

13

think you wouldn't run into that problem.

14

I mean, of course, the recipient

But I would like to address on this score an

15

important point, which is that I think Respondents have

16

suggested that there is a material distinction between,

17

Justice Breyer, the circumstances in Rust and the

18

circumstances in this case because Rust involves

19

separate programs within a legal entity, and this case

20

involves separate organizations.

21

And I think the point the Respondents are

22

trying to make is that there is a distinction because at

23

least, there, one legal entity could have multiple

24

programs, some of which are subject to the condition and

25

some of which are not, whereas, here, there is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 20

1

difference because this condition applies to an entire

2

organization.

3

But I think that's a false premise, which --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I wasn't excepting that

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was -- I mean, the main

5

one.

8

difference it seemed to me is, assuming all of that

9

away, is that, here, the separate structure does not

10

fulfill the constitutional need simply because the basic

11

condition has to do with express speech, because when A

12

says, I believe in X, and then they set up a separate

13

structure -- and every one knows they have set it up; I

14

mean, that's the point of it -- and the structure says,

15

"just kidding," nobody believes them from day one.

16

And so you can't do it, and, if the

17

government has its way and has awarded the thing

18

properly, according to your criteria, the part that

19

won't be believed is the "just kidding" part.

20

the structure -- separate structure -- just doesn't work

21

in terms of communicating their belief.

22

think that's true in Rust, and I don't think it's true

23

in Regan, and I do think it's true in FCC v. League of

24

Women Voters.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And so

And I don't

I guess I'd -- I'd make two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 21

1

points, Justice Breyer.

2

One is, as I was suggesting earlier, the

3

purpose of having this alternate channel is not to

4

remedy a constitutional violation that otherwise would

5

exist.

6

that it's okay to require this condition at the front

7

end.

8

to compensate for that is to create this affiliate

9

alternative.

10

I mean, of course, we start from the premise

It's not that it's unconstitutional, and the way

We think the condition's okay ab initio.

11

What the alternate vehicle does is to address this other

12

problem, that it shows that the condition is

13

appropriately tailored.

14

appropriate confines because it's allowing --

15

It's not reaching beyond its

JUSTICE BREYER:

Boy, if -- if the

16

structure -- the separate structure is not really part

17

of a constitutional analysis, then the government could

18

say, why not?

19

really find very, very decent and thoughtful people who

20

agree with the policy reason, you know?

21

It's easy to find policy reasons, and

There -- there are people on both sides of

22

these questions, and they come in and they say, okay,

23

we're giving money for an anti-abortion purpose or a

24

pro-abortion purpose, you know --

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 22

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and -- and, suddenly,

2

people can't say anything in these areas in face of such

3

a condition.

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, itâ€™s part of the -- as

5

part of the constitutional analysis, I guess it's just

6

addressing a different part of the constitutional

7

analysis than -- than what Your -- Your Honor is

8

addressing.

9

I guess the other points that I'd make are

10

twofold.

11

notion that, if the organizations are sufficiently

12

separate, then -- as they have to be, to comply with the

13

regulations -- then it does work that one organization

14

can say that we have a particular policy, and the

15

organization -- another organization -- another

16

organization can say that we have a different policy,

17

precisely because of the premise that they're

18

sufficiently distinct.

19
20

One is that I think there is something to the

So I'm not seeing the same degree of
cognitive dissonance you are --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

23

But that's --

-- and the other point I'd

make --

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

25

Finish answering him, and then I'll --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 23

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Justice

Sotomayor.

3

The other point I'd make is this:

That the

4

speech-related objections that Respondents levy are

5

twofold, one is they complain about the threshold

6

condition.

7

manifests at pages 11 to 12 and 32 and 33 of their

8

brief -- is that they want to engage in activities that

9

involve affirmative speech.

10

But the second is -- and this is -- made --

They want to be able to participate in the

11

dialogue about prostitution and sex trafficking and

12

whether they should be legalized.

13

that aspect of what Respondents are complaining --

14

complaining about, I think the alternate affiliated

15

organization opportunity is a perfect remedy, in the

16

same way that it was in Rust and in the same way that

17

it -- that it was in Regan.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, with respect to

The problem that I have

19

with that answer is that it doesn't cure the

20

organization's need to stay true to its own beliefs

21

because if -- and I think this is what Justice Breyer is

22

trying to get to -- if itâ€™s truly an independent

23

organization speaking, then that's that organization's

24

belief; it's not an alternative under Rust to the needs

25

of that organization to have its own personal views.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 24

1

And -- and so I have that problem, which is

2

how is it an alternative for that organization to be

3

able to have its views?

4

Let me posit a hypothetical that I'm

5

actually very troubled by.

6

government is undertaking a campaign to prevent teen

7

pregnancy and its associated problems, and it wants to

8

promote the use of contraceptives that protect from

9

contracting -- you know, diseases, things like that.

10

Let's assume a city

And some of its programs involve the

11

distribution of contraceptives, but others involve

12

parenting classes for teenage mothers and offering them

13

free daycare.

14

part and the parenting part.

15

And a church seeks funds for the daycare

Can the city now say, because we have this

16

really important need to avoid sexually transmitted

17

diseases, anyone who seeks our funds also have to say

18

they believe in the use of contraceptives?

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

Justice Sotomayor -The church there would

say, we don't believe, and why should we say we believe?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

I -- I'd certainly

23

understand why a church would be reluctant to do that.

24

I mean, I guess -- you know, one way to look at it is

25

that the city, I think, would have to think very long

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 25

1

and hard about whether that's a -- a desirable policy

2

objective, precisely because some of the organizations

3

with which it wants to work are going to have difficulty

4

abiding by it.

5

front-end determination, as a matter of policy, about

6

whether that's an appropriate thing to pursue.

And so there's going to have to be a

7

But, if the city, as Congress did in this

8

case, thought that it was an appropriate thing to do,

9

then I think I would -- I think I would defend that --

10

apart from -- you know, free exercise issues of other

11

things that aren't in play here -- I think I would

12

defend it, as long as it's sufficiently germane and as

13

long as it's in furtherance of the policy objectives

14

that Congress -- or by, in your hypothetical, the

15

city --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me give you

17

another example that's along the same lines.

18

Federal government provides lots of funds to entities

19

and individuals who are involved in the provision of

20

health care.

21

The

So let's suppose Congress says that, we

22

think that the issue of guns is very germane to public

23

health, and therefore, we will not allow anybody to

24

receive any of these funds directly or indirectly,

25

unless that entity or person proclaims agreement with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 26

1

whatever we happen to think at the moment about guns.

2

So they must either say we believe that guns

3

should be strictly limited -- access to them should be

4

strictly limited for public health purposes or that guns

5

should be freely available because we think that

6

promotes public health.

7

wouldn't it?

8
9

That would be permissible,

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't know that it would,

Justice Alito, on that --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, why would it not?
-- because -- because I

12

think, first of all, it would depend on whether

13

there -- there is the requisite germaneness.

14

depend on whether, in fact, the organizations are

15

working with -- I'm trying to avoid using the word

16

"partnering with" -- but are working with the -- the

17

government in carrying out the program.

18

on those kinds of considerations.

19

It would

It would depend

And whether -- another point to be made here

20

is that a limitation that's been recognized in this

21

Court's cases is that, at the end of the day, the

22

government -- the government can't be seeking to

23

suppress speech or to suppress disfavored viewpoints,

24

even in the context of subsidization.

25

And you'd have to ask the question whether

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 27

1

that scheme is designed to do that.

2

crossed all those thresholds, then I think, yes, I would

3

defend that as well, but I do think that it presents

4

different and more difficult questions.

5

I would like to --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, if -- if it

One -- one thing before

7

your time is up.

8

Ginsburg expressed about the difficulty of simply

9

creating structures in -- in foreign countries.

10

I have the same concerns that Justice

If --

and I've looked through all of your cases.

11

What's your closest case -- your best case

12

for the fact that you should get extra deference because

13

this is the foreign affairs field?

14

U.S. v. Curtis Wright.

15

that?

16

I mean, I think of

Anything more specific than

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't know that I have a

17

particular case, other than the doctrine, generally,

18

Justice Kennedy.

19

location of this is significant vis-Ã -vis the concern

20

that I think many of you have raised about why have an

21

affirmative condition that requires espousal of a

22

policy.

23

But I do think that the foreign

Precisely because the conduct here is

24

carried out in foreign areas and precisely because it

25

can involve myriad interactions with local officials and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 28

1

local policymakers, as Respondents admittedly want to

2

do, on these sensitive questions, it makes sense in this

3

context -- particular sense in this context to secure an

4

ex ante commitment of agreement with the government's

5

policy because that will have a self-policing aspect to

6

it.

7

It will be more designed to secure conduct

8

in those areas that, in conformity with Federal policy,

9

in a realm in which that conduct is particularly --

10
11
12

particularly difficult to monitor.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal, if I might.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Mr. Bowker?

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. BOWKER

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17
18
19

MR. BOWKER:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondents do not dispute that the Spending

20

Clause gives the government significant authority to

21

fund the programs of its choosing and to control speech

22

and conduct within those programs.

23

The problem with the policy requirement is

24

that it aims at grantees, requiring that they profess a

25

personal belief and refrain from certain private speech

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 29

1
2

outside the context of the government program.
In Rust v. Sullivan, the Court held that the

3

government could ban abortion-related speech in the

4

government's own family planning program, but the

5

grantees there were left unfettered in their personal

6

beliefs and in their private speech outside the program.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't see why this

8

is a -- you talk about banning their speech.

The

9

government is just picking out who is an appropriate

10

partner to -- to assist in this project.

11

and find people who, like them, are opposed to

12

prostitution, and all they want to do is make sure that

13

you're opposed to prostitution.

14

It wants to go

It's like any other sort of condition -- you

15

know, we want to make sure that you haven't been

16

convicted of tax fraud over the last 10 years, so sign a

17

certification that you -- you haven't.

18

related to speech, but the whole program is about that.

19
20
21

Yes, it's

Why would they want to sign up with somebody
who didn't share the objectives of the program?
MR. BOWKER:

Well, I think the policy

22

requirement here has been applied a little differently

23

than Mr. Chief Justice suggests.

24

a way that is a funding condition, not part of the

25

selection criteria.

It -- it is applied in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 30

1

When the government goes out to select its

2

partners in this case, it -- it goes out with requests

3

for applications, and those requests for applications

4

pertain to the particular program at issue.

5

are very detailed about what precisely is required for

6

that program, including --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And they

So it would be a

8

different case, in your -- your view, as if -- when they

9

have those criteria, they have one of them is, oh, by

10

the way, you must agree with the objective of the

11

program, which is to eliminate, to the extent possible,

12

prostitution and sex trafficking?

13

MR. BOWKER:

No.

I don't -- I don't think

14

that's right.

15

can pick partners who are dedicated to the particular

16

program for which they are applying, but there are

17

constitutionally permissible ways to do that.

18

I -- I think the government absolutely

One of the ways to do that is to look at

19

technical capacity, past performance, references, what

20

have you done before that shows you're able to do this

21

particular program?

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it isn't just able to

23

do.

Are -- are you saying that they -- they just can't

24

make it a prior condition, but they can select

25

applicants on the basis of which ones they know agree

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 31

1

with the government's objectives?

2

You -- you have two equally qualified --

3

technically, two equally qualified applicants, and the

4

government intentionally picks the one whose views on --

5

on prostitution are -- are similar to the government's.

6

Is -- is that bad?

7

MR. BOWKER:

Yes.

And -- and the reason

8

it's bad is because the government there is focused on

9

viewpoint and not on ability to perform the program.

10

The problem -- the problem with focusing --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But let -- let me -- let

12

me ask you this:

13

Congresswomen, and you are a constitutional expert, and

14

you take your oath to uphold the Constitution very

15

seriously.

16

Suppose that you're a Congressman or a

A funding bill comes before you.

You're the

17

chairman of the committee, and you decide that you're

18

going to fund A, rather than B, because you like their

19

speech much better.

20

Constitution?

Is that a violation of the

21

MR. BOWKER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

Well -Because you like their

policies much better?
MR. BOWKER:

The -- the Congress can

certainly fund a particular program and not fund others.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 32

1

And we have no -- we have no argument with that.

2

spending condition -- the Spending Clause definitely

3

comes with that ancillary power.

4

what the Congress did here.

5

want to fund a fight against HIV/AIDS.

6

support that disease, and we want to oppose

7

prostitution, we don't want to support that practice.

8
9
10

The

And, in fact, that's

It said, we want to -- we
We don't want to

What it cannot do, then, is take its
viewpoint and impose its viewpoint on the grantee and
make it a -- make it a condition.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm -- I'm not quite

12

sure I -- I see the difference, that the -- a

13

conscientious Congressperson cannot -- can, in your

14

view, say, I'm going to prefer organization A over

15

organization B because I like their policies better --

16

MR. BOWKER:

Well, I don't --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- across the board, with

18

reference to drugs, with reference to guns, with

19

reference to public health.

20

MR. BOWKER:

If -- if Congress is looking at

21

the viewpoint of an organization and deciding whether to

22

fund it based on its viewpoint, I think that's

23

problematic.

24

because this Court has said to deny a subsidy or a

25

benefit on the basis of the exercise of one's First

And the reason I think it's problematic is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 33

1

Amendment rights, including holding one's own views, to

2

deny a subsidy on that ground --

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, my goodness.

They

can't --

5

MR. BOWKER:

-- is problematic.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- they can't fund the Boy

7

Scouts of America because they like the programs that

8

the BSA has?

9

equivalently with the Muslim Brotherhood?

10

They -- they have to treat them
Is that

really what you're suggesting?

11

MR. BOWKER:

Not at all.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think --

Well, then, you can take

13

into account the -- the principles and the -- and the

14

policies of -- of the organization that you're giving

15

funding to.

16

MR. BOWKER:

Well, this Court has never said

17

that the Congress can make a decision based on viewpoint

18

alone.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

But there's no way to

20

separate -- with an organization in the field that does

21

things, there is no way, I don't think, to separate what

22

they do from what they say.

23

views on this in front of it.

24

MR. BOWKER:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Congress has two opposite

Sure.
One is the view that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 34

1

way to fight AIDS is consistent with and is furthered by

2

longer term efforts to abolish trafficking in women,

3

okay?

Prostitution.

4

All right.

The other view is the better way

5

to do it is to go into the active sex worker area and --

6

and not express views on the merits of what they are

7

doing, okay?

8
9

So they have two opposite views, and -- and,
moreover, the groups that do this act on those views.

10

So why can't they say, we prefer view A or B, whichever

11

it is, and -- because that's what our program is about?

12

MR. BOWKER:

Congress can -- can certainly

13

decide what programs to fund and what programs not to

14

fund.

15

then can't take the next step to say the only people who

16

can get funds under this particular program are people

17

who agree with us and who will refrain from saying

18

anything inconsistent in their private speech.

But, when Congress makes that decision, Congress

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- you go further

20

than that.

In answer to my question, you -- you go

21

further than that, and you say, moreover, even without

22

making it a condition precedent to getting the money,

23

Congress can -- the government cannot intentionally

24

select those people that it thinks are in accord with

25

its views.

Right?

Isn't that what you said?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not asking what the

5

MR. BOWKER:

It's our position that it is

6

constitutionally problematic to make funding decisions

based on the viewpoint of grantees.

However -- however, we are not

saying that there is no circumstance in which the

15

override the First Amendment right.

Now, in our

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

the government wants to have an ad campaign to

20

discourage people from smoking and they are looking for

21

ad agencies to -- to help them with it.

22

agency comes in and says, look, we are the best ad

23

agency there is; we know exactly how to get to the

24

markets; we know what's persuasive and all of that.

25

you know, come work at our agency if you smoke; we think

2

smoking is okay; we have smoking breaks; we do all this.

3

The government can't take that into account?

4

MR. BOWKER:

I think the rules are different

5

when the government hires a spokesperson.

6

government hires a spokesperson, the government has the

7

right under the -- under its ancillary power, under the

8

Spending Clause, to control what that spokesperson says

9

for the government.

10

When the

And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't that

11

part of what's going on here?

12

to do is eradicate prostitution and sex trafficking, and

13

we want you to get that message out, and the one thing

14

we're sure of is if you're not in -- if you're in

15

favor -- or you're not opposed to it because you have

16

other objectives, you're not going to help get the

17

message out at all?

18

MR. BOWKER:

One of the things we want

Well, the -- the government

19

does say that.

20

prevent is the situation where the -- the government

21

spokesperson says one thing with public funds, turns

22

right around and says the opposite with private funds.

23

The government says, what we need to

And what we say is this is an as-applied

24

challenge.

We have -- it's -- the government concedes

25

my clients have not been enlisted as government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

spokespersons and they are not responsible for conveying

2

any viewpoint or any message.

3

And I'd like to talk for a moment about what

4

my clients really do.

5

services in the fight against HIV/AIDS, things such as

6

preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in

7

Tanzania, caring for orphans of AIDS victims in Kenya,

8

and providing HIV/AIDS support services in places like

9

Vietnam.

10

In the field, my clients provide

And -- and this is at JA 88 and 89, where you

11

can see the list of things that my clients do.

12

those things relate to an opposition to prostitution and

13

none of those things relates to messaging.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

None of

That's my

15

problem, which is I'm trying to tease out what your

16

position is, okay?

17

you're saying, you can't compel me to say I don't like

18

something.

19

That -- that's understandable.

20

I -- I have an understanding of

And -- and that's like a oath of loyalty.

But, if the government said the following

21

more clearly -- this is an oddly phrased policy, okay,

22

because it seems to be requiring this oath.

23

simply said, if you're an organization that wants our

24

funds, you have to say that you're not going to promote

25

actively the contrary policy, would that be okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

But if it

You're not going to go out there and do

2

things to promote the legalization of prostitution

3

because that's going to undermine our message.

4

are two different positions, so tell me where you draw

5

the line.

6

MR. BOWKER:

Those

Certainly, that would be okay

7

within the four corners of the government program.

8

government controls speech and conduct within its

9

program.

It can tell us what not to say within the

10

program.

And that's Rust.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BOWKER:

The

Yes, that's Rust.

And that's Rust.

And what --

This is a step further.

And what Rust says, and I -- I

15

think we fall back on Rust, which we think is just on

16

all fours with where we are here, and that is what the

17

government cannot do -- and I think this answers your

18

question -- is, outside the government program, the

19

government cannot control private speech.

20

And it was critical in that case -- Justice

21

Rehnquist, at pages 196 and 197, said, "The doctors

22

there and the public health organizations there are free

23

to engage in their own private speech and their own

24

activities, and they are not required to endorse any

25

viewpoint they don't, in fact, hold."

And here --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that is saying

3

this is what's happening in Rust, okay?

And Rust is

4

okay.

5

that way, and, if it's any other way, it's no good.

6

seems to me that you're just taking the limitation on

7

the facts in Rust and saying that is an absolute

8

requirement, which is a misreading of the case.

That's very different from saying, it has to be

9

MR. BOWKER:

It

Rust does not say that, to be

10

clear.

But the reasoning of Rust -- and the majority's

11

reasoning there makes quite clear that the reason the

12

Court was comfortable there is that the recipient was

13

not the target of the control.

14

the program, and the recipient was free outside the

15

program.

16

The control was around

And -- and Respondents here have respected

17

that line.

There is no question that, for the past 10

18

years, even though the policy requirement has not been

19

enforced -- initially because the Department of Justice

20

concluded that it is unconstitutional and then,

21

subsequently, because the district court enjoined it --

22

it has not been enforced for the last decade,

23

essentially.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. BOWKER:

So --

And there's no evidence of harm

Sorry, Justice.

legalization of prostitution?

Am I making my question clear?

13

MR. BOWKER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
Which is how do you --

15

how do you answer the question of why does the

Taking that case, I think the
I think the government cannot

gag an organization's private speech outside the

program.

3

Now, even the government says there has to

4

be some germaneness between what they are doing in the

5

program and what our requirement is.

6

would be a tougher case for us and a stronger case for

7

the government if my clients were engaged in a program

8

that opposed prostitution -- we're not, but if we

9

were -- and then we went right outside and said the

So I do think it

10

opposite with our private funds, I think they would have

11

an easier time showing that there is some compelling

12

interest that overrides the First Amendment interest.

13
14

Now, I think it would depend on the facts,
and those are not the facts here.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Only because -- see, it's

16

not -- it's not, in my opinion, not a viewpoint matter,

17

if they're going to fund a -- a group that wants to end

18

discrimination against women around the world because

19

they think all kinds of good things will flow from that.

20

The government wants to fund it.

21

22

business.

Of course, such a

words -- if you were me and if I were to decide in your

4

favor, what form of words would you dictate to describe

5

where it is in your opinion that the First Amendment

6

cuts in with a preventative restriction?

7
8

And what are the form of

How do you describe it?

I -- I don't think

you can, in terms of viewpoint.

9

MR. BOWKER:

I don't think you can, in terms

10

of viewpoint, either, Justice Breyer.

11

the key -- the key that this Court outlined in Rust is

12

the government's authority to control its program.

13

if there is a threat to its program and the government

14

needs to take some action in order to protect its

15

program, prevent the message from being garbled or

16

distorted, whatever the language is, then the

17

government's case is strongest.

18

I do think that

And,

Here, that is not at all what is happening.

19

As I described, our programs are not opposition to

20

prostitution programs.

21

These are mother-to-child transmission situations, where

22

we're trying to stop the disease from spreading.

23
24

Our programs are HIV testing.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- I understand what you've

just conceded in -- in your response to Justice Breyer?
The government could require, as a condition

4

to come into this program and become a partner with the

5

United States, that the recipient not have the viewpoint

6

of favoring prostitution?

7

MR. BOWKER:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

No.
Well, you said it's not a

viewpoint thing.
MR. BOWKER:

No.

The government cannot

11

target viewpoint, and, for us, that's -- that's a

12

bright-line rule.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that's what you

just said to Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I did, too, because I -- I

16

didn't see the reason.

17

think of dozens and dozens of programs all over the

18

world that the government supports, in some way or

19

other, and, of course, the people in those programs have

20

a certain viewpoint, and, of course, they don't hold the

21

opposite viewpoint.

22

I thought that was -- I can

Otherwise, they wouldn't be in the program.

23

So -- so that's why I didn't find that useful.

answering these questions.

MR. BOWKER:

Well, our position here is that

12

viewpoint is not the basis on which a decision can be

13

made.

14

has a multitude of permissible grounds on which to make

15

these types of decisions, and they do it every day in

every other program where they don't have this odd

17

policy requirement.

That is our position.

18

We think the government

They do it every day.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your approach, it

19

seems to me, is just dealing with the breadth of the

20

program.

21

prostitution and sex trafficking and not other areas

22

where you say, look, we do a great job in these other

23

areas, we just don't get involved in that area.

and sex trafficking, you -- you wouldn't have a leg to

5

We absolutely would have a leg

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're an

organization --

6

MR. BOWKER:

-- what I attempted to concede

7

before, and that is, if -- if the government -- in that

8

narrow case, where the government is hiring a

9

spokesperson, which is what they've focused on, saying

10

one thing with public funds and turning right around and

11

saying another with private funds, there is no case that

12

says they can gag the private speech of that

13

spokesperson.

14

But what we're saying is it is certainly

15

possible that they would have a stronger case in that

16

particular circumstance; however, this is an as-applied

challenge.

concede that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

ask -- ask this one more time.

It seems -- because it

23

seems to me that, when you get into the details of your

24

answer, you indicate, oh, well, the government has lots

25

of other criteria it could use, which seems to me just

an invitation to disguise what the government's real

2

motive is.

3

Suppose the government's interested in

4

preventing and stopping the spread of malaria.

And

5

there's an organization that's marvelous at delivering

6

the proper message for this, but they criticize the

7

United States often.

8

that's not quite as good, but is quiet on these other

9

issues.

So they choose an organization

10

Is that permissible for the Congress to do?

11

MR. BOWKER:

No, I don't think it is.

To

12

the extent the -- the criteria used by the Congress are

13

merely pretext to --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, this isn't -- no.

15

My concern was that your position was pretext.

16

the Congress is right upfront.

17

MR. BOWKER:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Here,

And says this is the reason.
And they say, the reason

19

we're not giving to organization A is because it's

20

always critical of the United States, even though its

21

technical skills are better, we prefer organization B.

22

Congress cannot do that?

23
24
25

MR. BOWKER:

Congress cannot do that.

Now -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And your best case for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 47

1

that proposition is what?

2

MR. BOWKER:

Well, even the government

3

concedes that -- that they can't do that.

4

they say is that in -- it must be germane.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They -- what
That's their

Well, I'm -- I'm not sure

they should if they're going to -- if they're going to

be able to establish the principle that allows them to

9

prevail in this case, and that's why I'm asking.

10

MR. BOWKER:

I -- I don't think that that's

11

permissible because all that is, is penalizing a

12

particular viewpoint and withholding a subsidy or

13

benefit based on viewpoint.

sure I -- the government has a program to develop water

19

And there's a pro-apartheid

And you're saying the government can only

20

decide which one is better at digging wells, and it

21

can't say, we're going to prefer the anti-apartheid

22

group?

can make that decision based on viewpoint.

It can't say -- so the other one shows we've

2

got a better record, we dig the wells quicker.
MR. BOWKER:

3

I mean, the -- the reason that

4

that case is so much tougher than this one is because,

5

in this one, they're not attempting to select

6

organizations that will do the best job by using the

7

policy requirement.

8
9

The policy requirement is being used after
the organization has been selected to say, now that

10

you've been selected, we want you to toe the line.

want you to profess your belief in our viewpoint and not

12

to say anything with your private funds outside the

you fresh water, and it's a -- it's a pro-apartheid group.

21

It's related to it.

The

That does undermine what they are trying to

22

do, just as in this case, to have the organization

23

providing the services that your organization provides

24

be identified as as an organization that doesn't want to

25

abolish prostitution.

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 49

1

MR. BOWKER:

Yes, I understand.

2

I -- I think the government could -- if it

3

could make the case that an organization will be unable

4

to do this effectively because of what it has said in

5

the past -- or what it has done in the past or how --

6

how the population associates -- what the population

7

associates with that organization.

8
9

But here -- here -- and the government even
concedes -- there would -- there has to be some -- I

think the word was -- it has to be tightly tethered to

11

the programmatic objective.

12

that's way too easy to fulfill; that should not be the

13

standard.

principle is, is germaneness, tightly tethered.

Now, we think that's --

to us, it's more than just have a policy.

It's have a

10

policy and then tell us you agree with our policy, and

we want to make sure that you believe it, so we know

that you will do a good job in the program.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the

They can get all that

15

without making you profess it, unless -- unless you

16

consider the only -- only profession to be the assurance

17

to the -- to your partner, the United States government,

18

that you -- that you, in, fact oppose prostitution.

19

MR. BOWKER:

Well, that's -- that's

20

precisely it, Justice Scalia, is we are required to

profess our allegiance to the government.

5

pledge.

6

That's the pledge to the government.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Now --

And then they're doing

7

that, they say, because we're part of the belief, as a

matter of policy, that the best way to go about this,

whether you think so or not, is to restrict the grants

Within the program, they can

the -- the limitation that the Court has imposed in its

22

suppress a viewpoint.

our policies.

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

organization that previously has expressed support for

5

you tell them, well, if that's your policy, you can't

get our money, they say, well, we need your money, so

we're going to have to say uncle and, now, we are

another sense, that I should add, which is that, when

of the United States.

13

So there is a real perception out there

14

that, when the organization is carrying out its

15

functions, it's doing so at the behest of the United

16

States citizens.

17

was to avoid a misimpression about why -- about what the

18

United States' policy priorities are.

19

And part of what Congress wanted to do

And one way to do that is to assure that the

20

organizations with which the United States works share

21

the United States' policy commitment against

22

prostitution and sex trafficking.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I would have less

24

problem accepting your message if there weren't four

25

major organizations who were exempted from the policy

exempted.

3

There seems to be a bit of selection on the

4

part of the government in terms of who it wants to work

5

with.

protect the U.S., you wouldn't exempt anybody from this.

It would seem to me that, if you really wanted to

One can understand why Congress would have

wanted to tread with sensitivity when -- when we are

dealing with foreign countries, especially foreign

5

countries that have different views about prostitution.

And there's less of a danger -- and this is

the final point -- there's less of a danger in that
