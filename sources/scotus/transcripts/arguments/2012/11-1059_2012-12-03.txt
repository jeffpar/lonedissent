ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The decision of the court of appeals

12

deprives the Defendant of the ability to free itself

13

from litigation, even when it is willing to pay complete

14

relief to the sole Plaintiff; thus, as long as the

15

Plaintiff refuses to accept full and complete payment, a

16

putative collective action must continue onward to

17

certification.

18

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did that offer include

admission of liability?
Or was it just that it was going to pay the
amount of damages requested?
MR. MANN:

That's a good question,

23

Justice Ginsburg.

Because it was an offer of judgment,

24

if the offer had been accepted, the result would have

25

been a judgment by the Federal court imposing liability
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under the statute, under the Fair Labor Standards Act,

2

on the Defendant, and requiring the Defendant to pay

3

full and complete relief, including costs and attorneys'

4

fees, to the Plaintiffs.

5

judgment of the Federal court imposing liability under

6

the statute.

7

So there would have been a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if -- if there were

8

judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for

9

all other people similarly situated?
MR. MANN:

10

Well, I think there is rules of

11

issuing claim conclusion that would flow from the

12

judgment, and it would have --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that -- so the next

14

case is another employee who claims uncompensated work

15

time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated

16

people.

17

would be subject to summary judgment because the

18

liability has been established.

Then that next case, the employer would be --

19

MR. MANN:

Well, there would be a variety of

20

fact questions that would have to be resolved to

21

determine the extent of the preclusion from the first

22

judgment.

23

would apply.

24

matters that were comprehended within the judgment to

25

bind, in a later case, they would.

But the rules of issue and claim preclusion
And to the extent those rules call for

1

I think the way that I would put it, looking

2

back to Justice Kagan's opinion in the Smith v. Bayer

3

case, it's common for there to be a preclusive effect of

4

a judgment in one case against people that are not

5

parties.

liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, based on

7

the allegations made in the complaint.

8

what --

9

And this would have been a judgment imposing

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's

Counsel, so what am I to

10

make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer

11

itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear

12

that the offer of judgment, quote, "was not to be

13

construed as an admission that Petitioners are liable in

14

this action or that Respondent has suffered any damage"?

15

What -- what are we to make of that --

16

MR. MANN:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let me --- when you're now

18

claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of

19

liability?

20

MR. MANN:

Well, I don't think that you have

21

to rely on my statements here, to say that we would have

22

accepted judgment of liability at that time.

23

offer itself has a formal offer of judgment on a form

24

promulgated by the trial court.

2

the Defendant.

3

ordinary rules for Rule 68, if -- if they accept the

4

offer, there would be a judgment against our client.

5

The offer itself is not a judgment against

6

The offer is a statement that, under the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How did you pick the

$7,500?

7

MR. MANN:

8

Joint Appendix, at pages 77 to 79.

9

what our client did is they took the amount of time for

10

breaks during the Respondent's period of employment and

11

offered her full wages for all of the break time, so

12

that whatever amount of break time was appropriately

13

charged for her --

14

That's detailed later in the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, essentially,

I see in the -- in the

15

FLSA, that it also requires an amount for liquidated

16

damages.

17

Did you include that amount as well?

18
19

MR. MANN:

Yes, Your Honor -- yes, Justice

Sotomayor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, what if the

20

district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the

21

suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge

22

says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness, I also

23

want to address the certification issue, the mootness

24

argument is scheduled for three months down the road,

25

the certification issue for two months down the road;
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

isn't this just a question of what order the district

2

court wants to address these two issues?

3

MR. MANN:

Okay.

So there is two things I

4

want to say about that.

5

what happened in this particular case, which is the case

6

that's before the Court; and, the second is to discuss

7

the practical consequences of what could have happened

8

in some other case.

9

The first one is to talk about

So what happened in this case is that it was

10

uncontested that the offer provided complete relief.

11

And so the Respondent suffered a judgment to be entered

12

against her because of the conceded acts of the offer.

13

And at the time that judgment was entered, nothing had

14

been done about certification.

15

was entered -- had made -- nothing had been done about

16

certification.

17

So what we --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At the time the offer

But it was not possible

19

for anything to be done about the certification because

20

you moved immediately.

21

you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment

22

that you did.

23

MR. MANN:

The complaint is filed, and then

Well, I think there is two

24

questions to unpack here that -- that are implicit in

25

both what the Chief Justice is commenting on and what
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're commenting on, Justice Ginsburg.

2

One is the question that was presented in

3

the petition, which is:

4

collective action if, before certification or any motion

5

for collective process has been determined, the sole

6

plaintiff loses the case.

7

What is the effect on a

The second one is:

How do you deal with the

8

housekeeping issues of terminating the interest of a

9

plaintiff when there's no longer controversy between the

10

plaintiff and the defendant?

11

And so --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it seems as though

13

it's more than a housekeeping issue that's involved here

14

because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument

15

about what happens when the plaintiff's individual

16

claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff

17

continues to want to represent other individuals.

18

But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims

19

had not been fully satisfied.

She walked away with

20

nothing.

21

walked away with no $7,500.

22

can it possibly be that her individual claim was moot?

She walked away with no judgment, and she

Okay.

And the question is:

How

23

MR. MANN:

So I think there is two --

24

again, there's two things to say.

25

as a housekeeping question because it seems to us clear

One is:

8
Alderson Reporting Company

We view it

Official

1

that, if the defendant no longer wishes to contest

2

liability and formally offers to pay all of the relief

3

that the person could possibly win in any formal

4

litigation, it has to be the case that the individual's

5

interest is moot.

6

Now, it might be that the appropriate

7

response is, as is consistent with the Third Circuit, is

8

that the district court should just dismiss the case

9

because, if the person won't take yes for an answer, the

10

Federal court doesn't need anything further --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is nothing in

12

Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule

13

that provides as the only sanction, if the plaintiff

14

continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then

15

the plaintiff has to pay the costs.

16

anything about dismissing suits.

17

MR. MANN:

Rule 68 doesn't say

Well, I don't think our position

18

depends on Rule 68 at all for the mootness.

19

position for the mootness is that, if there's no further

20

controversy about the relief that is created by the

21

cause of action, there's nothing more for the trial

22

court to do --

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Our

Well, let me ask you

this -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Justice Kennedy.

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me ask you just this

2

question -- just tell me as a matter of common practice,

3

do district courts enter judgments against plaintiffs

4

routinely when a full offer of settlement has been made

5

and the defendant just is silent?

6

happen?

7
8

I mean, does this

I just can't remember seeing a -- but
this --

9

MR. MANN:

There's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

It may -- it may be that

11

it's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't

12

reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court,

13

the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to

14

enter judgment.
MR. MANN:

15

I think -- I think that the

16

courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to

17

what I'm characterizing as a housekeeping question of,

18

if there's no further controversy between the plaintiff

19

and the defendant, how do we move the case off our

20

docket?

21

courts of appeals, is that you enter a judgment against

22

the plaintiff, whether they like it or not.

23
24
25

One approach, which is followed by some of the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As a matter of

housekeeping, you could -MR. MANN:

In favor of the plaintiff -- you
10

Alderson Reporting Company

1

enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff -- that needs

2

to be clear -- in favor of the plaintiff --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MR. MANN:

Right.

Whether they want a judgment or

5

not, you say, here's everything you asked for; you must

6

take it.

7

Another approach is to say, if they're

8

willing to give you everything to which you're entitled

9

and you won't take it, then there's no reason why we

10

should continue to adjudicate your case because there's

11

not really a controversy.

12

Our --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, here's what -- here is

13

what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it

14

said, "What makes a case moot?"

15

becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant

16

any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party."

17

It says, "A case

Now, here, the judge says, okay, is this

18

case moot?

19

at the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500,

20

but, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has

21

her claim for at least $7500, regardless of the

22

collective side of this action.

23

satisfied.

24
25

Well, it's not moot because I could give --

MR. MANN:

cases -- and I suppose in the Nike case from last

month -- is this general problem of a defendant is faced

5

with a piece of litigation, and they no longer wish to

6

contest it.

7

And the -- the -- what's going on in those

If the action seeks prospective relief, it's

8

quite difficult, once the case has begun, for the

9

defendant to convince the court that they are going to

11

prospective relief.

12

13

And this Court's had a series of

In a case that only seeks retrospective

16

everything the person could get.

17

One way would be to formally offer to pay

What happened in this case and what's before

18

the Court is simply if that happens.

19

here is there was an offer that was conceded to be

20

adequate, and the plaintiff suffered a judgment to be

21

entered against her on the premise that she had no

22

further claim.

23

So what happened

And the question is, if that interest is

24

gone, which has been conceded at all stages of the

25

litigation, until the bottom side briefing on the merits

Alderson Reporting Company

in this Court, what's the consequences for the

2

collective action?

3

And so what the parties have litigated

4

about -- because this was conceded repeatedly over the

5

course of several years, is what happens when that

6

interest is moot.

7

Now, we believe that it is correct that a

8

defendant, faced with litigation that it does not wish

9

to contest, can terminate the litigation.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do when --

11

when you have a governing statute that says that an

12

employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and

13

other employees similarly situated?

14

rule, Rule 68, to cut out what the statute authors --

15

authorizes; that is, that the employee can seek relief

16

on behalf of himself and others similarly situated?

17

Can you use a mere

Mustn't you give a chance for the statutory

18

provision to work, which you didn't.

19

immediately, you didn't allow the normal process of

20

inviting opt-ins to occur.

21

MR. MANN:

By filing

I think that the language of the

22

statute, Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act,

23

provides compelling guidance for the case that the court

24

of appeals ignored.

25

In this case, because it's under the Fair
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Labor Standards Act, the very paragraph you're looking

2

at, Congress has opined -- and I'll say it's only an

3

opinion because the lower courts ignored it.

4

Congress at least has opined as to how you tell when

5

people that are not yet before the court can be treated

6

as relevant.

7
8

But

And the answer is the non-party plaintiffs
cannot be part of the case until they formally opt-in --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

the plaintiff an opportunity.

11

MR. MANN:

Yes, but you have to give
That --

The -- the statute does not say,

12

if a plaintiff files a case and alleges that other

13

people are similarly situated, the case shall not be

14

dismissed until the court has proceeded to conclusively

15

determine the propriety of certification.

16

say that.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't

Suppose -- suppose the

18

plaintiff had simultaneously, with the filing of the

19

complaint, moved to have it first preliminarily

20

certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so,

21

instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a

22

collective complaint, separate from a motion for

23

certification, they came together, that the plaintiff

24

filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for

25

certification and a request to discover the names of
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other people similarly situated.

2

MR. MANN:

I think the answer to that would

3

flow directly from this Court's decision in Geraghty.

4

The first question would be:

5

defendant's interest becomes moot, who is a party to the

6

case?

7

one person.

At the time that the

And the answer would be:

Well, there's just this

8

The next question would be:

Has the

9

district court ruled on certification in a way that

10

could have erroneously caused the mootness?

11

answer would be, no, because it became moot not because

12

of an erroneous district court ruling on certification,

13

which was the situation in Geraghty --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

wouldn't make any difference?

16

MR. MANN:

Well, the

So your answer is it

It wouldn't make any difference.

17

What Geraghty turns on, and -- and I encourage you to

18

look at the portion of footnote 11 that -- the last two

19

paragraphs of that footnote that goes over onto page

20

407, the court emphasizes -- all we're saying here, all

21

we're saying here is that, if the basis of mootness is

22

an error by the district court and if we later ascertain

23

that error, we will not only correct the error about

24

certification, but we will forgive the mootness that

25

flowed from that error.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

3

In this court case, there's no suggestion
that the district court error caused mootness to occur.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I don't

4

know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but

5

what -- if the judge can simply order the two

6

determinations in a way that certification is addressed

7

before mootness, does that take care of your problem?

8
9

Obviously, if you grant certification, there
is an ongoing controversy.

And under Roper and

10

Geraghty, if you deny certification, the relation-back

11

doctrine applies.

12

MR. MANN:

I think that -- that those cases

13

provide a way to analyze that situation.

14

possibility is that the district judge grants

15

certification at some moment after the complaint is filed,

16

and then later in time, the sole person who is in the

17

case at that time loses their interest in the case for

18

one reason or another.

19
20

So one

But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there's no

doubt that --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I have --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

There's

23

no doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes

24

forward, right?

25

MR. MANN:

There is doubt in that case.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

we would suggest that it's clear that it doesn't go

2

forward.

3

Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as

4

opposed to Rule 23, which was at issue in Geraghty, even

5

after the district judge signs an order saying, pursuant

6

to Justice Kennedy's opinion in Hoffman, we should send

7

notices out to see if we can find some new plaintiffs,

8

if none of those people have yet appeared before the

9

court and signed into the case, there is still only one

10

plaintiff.

11

So in Geraghty, it was important to the

12

Court that, when the case got here, although the

13

interest of the named prisoner had been vitiated, there

14

were several people who had filed motions to intervene.

15

And so it appeared that, at all times, there were other

16

people.

17

In this case, by contrast, there's every

18

reason to think that, after the person's interest was

19

vitiated, there were no other plaintiffs because --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what do you --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, can I ask a

22

fundamental question under Rule 68?

23

a district court judge, if parties told me about their

24

settlement discussions, I would get quite upset.

25

it says explicitly -- explicitly, "Evidence of an
17
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, when I was

But,

Official

1

unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a

2

proceeding to determine costs."

3
4

What authorizes you to use evidence of that
offer to argue anything --

5

MR. MANN:

So, again --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- especially when a --

7

the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory

8

right to refuse it at a specific penalty?

9

you to use it as evidence of anything, mootness -- I

10
11

What permits

don't care what you're using it for -- except in cost?
MR. MANN:

Okay.

So I would say two things.

12

The first thing is, of course, the plaintiff did not

13

challenge the use of the offer in the trial court.

14

The second thing, responsive to your

15

question on the merits is, trial courts have considered

16

this question, have generally considered that the offer

17

is admissible by analogy to Rule 408, which deals with

18

settlement discussions more generally, and the Advisory

19

Committee Notes discuss this.

20

And the general idea is the offer is being

21

admitted for a purpose other than to prove the validity

22

or amount of the disputed claim.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so -This makes no sense to

24

me because, if the offer is for judgment, it has to be

25

proof of validity and amount because, at least you
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have -- you should be able to get a judgment.

2

MR. MANN:

Well, I think that the offer is

3

not being admitted to prove the validity of the

4

plaintiff's claim or the amount of the plaintiff's

5

claim.

6

plaintiff has no --

7

The offer is being admitted to prove that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But didn't you just tell

8

me that an offer results in an admission of liability

9

and a judgment for a particular amount?
MR. MANN:

10

If the plaintiff accepts the

11

offer, then the district judge will enter offer -- will

12

enter judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of the

13

offer.

14

The district courts that have considered

15

this have ordinarily concluded that, in cases where the

16

offer is not accepted and the defendant contends that

17

the offer is complete, that the offer can be admitted

18

for the purpose of proving that there is no controversy

19

between the parties, which is distinct from admitting it

20

for the purpose of proving the validity or amount of the

21

claim.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr.

Mann, could -- could I

23

come back to your response to the question of Knox --

24

the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court

no standing.

2

to that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it

3

on the facts, but that statement was not meant to be

4

exclusive, that that's the only situation in which

5

there -- there is no standing.

6

That -- I would have thought your answer

It was addressing just the third prong of

7

our -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that,

8

where the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the

9

remedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of

10

standing is the court has to be able to provide relief.

11

But there are other elements to standing as well,

12

including whether there is injury, in fact, and whether

13

the injury is -- you know, springs from the action that

14

is challenged.

15

to exist.

16

And those -- those prongs would continue

I didn't think Knox's statement was meant to

17

be all-inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in

18

which standing can be eliminated.

I think that's correct,

And so the problem that we face here is

21

the -- the questioning relates to something that has --

23

relatively simple one, which is that, under the doctrine

24

of mootness, it has to be correct that, if there is not

2

And that was all conceded below.

The

5

She did not challenge that judgment on appeal.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Mann -- excuse me.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the -- can I ask this

8

question?

Does the district court have the authority

9

when an offer of judgment is made to hold a hearing as

10

to whether the offer of judgment actually gives the

11

plaintiff everything that the plaintiff could possibly

12

get under the complaint?

13

MR. MANN:

We think that's the appropriate

14

response.

15

the defendant makes an offer of judgment and -- and

16

files a motion to dismiss, suggesting that it provides

17

complete relief, that if the plaintiff doesn't concede

18

that the case should be dismissed, the district judge

19

should hold a hearing, as the district judge did here -JUSTICE ALITO:

20

say that in Rule 68?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

5

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

8
9

Katyal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

Thank you, counsel.

I'd like to begin with the question of
whether a withdrawn Rule 68 offer could moot a case.

It

10

cannot.

This Court has said that Article III's case and

11

controversy requirement demands both a plaintiff with a

12

concrete injury and a matter where the Court is fully

13

capable of -- of providing relief.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'd like to begin

15

with the question of whether or not you waived that

16

argument.

17

MR. KATYAL:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Absolutely, Your Honor.
No -- did you waive

it or not?
MR. KATYAL:

20

We -- We did not waive -- we

21

did not waive the -- we did not waive it.

We do think

22

that the brief in opposition should have pointed it out,

23

absolutely.

24

to bring to the Court's attention the -- the impact of

25

an unaccepted Rule 68 offer.

It was a mistake on our part not to -- not

However, we do think that

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this Court can -- can consider that, and the reason for

2

that is that it is an answer to the question presented.

3

Indeed, it is literally the question presented.

4

Here is the question presented as -- as my

5

friend Mr. Mann wrote it, whether a court -- "whether a

6

case becomes moot and, thus, beyond the judicial power

7

of Article III when the lone plaintiff receives an offer

8

from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff's

9

claims."

And we submit that the answer to that question

10

is no, that the mere receipt of an offer, without more,

11

cannot possibly moot a case.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that was not

13

the way the case was presented in the body of the

14

petition, and I would suppose, if that were your

15

objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we

16

might have heard about that, as you -- as you suggest.

17

MR. KATYAL:

And --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if, in fact, we

19

thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68

20

offer was not accepted, we might have thought

21

differently about whether to grant it.

22

MR. KATYAL:

I -- I completely understand

23

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

I guess I would say, however,

24

this Court, in Lebron, confronted a similar situation,

25

in which the matter of whether Amtrak was a State actor,
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was not present in the cert papers; indeed, it had been

2

disavowed, as Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court

3

said.

4

Nonetheless, the Court considered it and --

5

and got into the merits of that question.

6

here, actually, it's an easier case for the Court to get

7

into than Lebron.

And we think

Both --

Your reformulated question

It does have the unaccepted

Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a separate matter.

That's about what

And our first point to you
Mr. Mann is

She is as injured today as

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What do you think the court

8

should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes

9

forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire

10

claim?

What should happen?

11

MR. KATYAL:

If -- we think that, just like

12

the Solicitor General, we think that, in that

13

circumstance, it is possible for a court to enter a

14

default judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff.

15

And we think --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

is this under some inherent authority?

18

MR. KATYAL:

Is this under Rule 68?

Or

I think it could work either

19

way, so long as the forcing happened within the time

20

period of Rule 68.

21

like Lazarus, raise this after it has already been

22

25

default judgment within the 14-day period, then I think

possible to do.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what benefit

4

does this -- why are you arguing so much?

5

will have an entry of judgment in the favor of your

6

client who is, according to you, similarly situated to

7

lots of others.

8

You -- you

Why don't you just -- if somebody comes

9

forward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for

10

$7500, or whatever it is, you get attorneys' fees, and

11

you can do that as often as you want.

12

MR. KATYAL:

For two reasons, Your Honor.

13

The first is, of course, that is precisely what didn't

14

happen here.

15

$7500 --

16

Ms. Symczyk has zero, not even the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

20

offer, if you waive that argument.

21

case where the offer is accepted.

22

And we are dealing, perhaps, with a case on

MR. KATYAL:

So -- so assume the

And I think it goes back to

23

what then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper because what

24

he said is it's not then just about the individual

25

plaintiff.

You can't force an offer onto a plaintiff
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that doesn't have all -- it doesn't award complete

2

relief because, if you do so, it undermines the

3

collective action aspect of the claim.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it undermines the

5

collective aspect, if she never brings the suit in the

6

first place.

7

terribly impressed by the fact that -- you know, if she

8

drops out there is -- there is no collective suit for

9

these other people.

I mean, I -- I must say I'm -- I'm not

There is also no collective suit

10

for these other people if she never appeared in the

11

first place.

12

I don't -- I don't know that the law demands

13

that there be a collective suit.

14

suit or if she brings suit and -- and is given

15

everything she wants, the case is over, unless other

16

people have come in.

17

MR. KATYAL:

If she doesn't bring

Justice Scalia, we think that

18

the Congress has answered that question, at least in

19

216(b), by providing for both the opportunity to file a

20

complaint on her own behalf, as well as for those that

21

are similarly situated.

22

Ginsburg said to my -- to my friend, if you adopt their

23

rule, essentially, you truncate that process and

24

eliminate the ability of people to opt in, in any given

25

situation.

And so I think that, as Justice

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And that -- for that reason, it's very

2

much -- assuming that we get to this question, that it

3

is very much like Gerstein or Sosna or Roper in that

4

circumstance --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Katyal, I'm a little

6

troubled that you have given up or argue that the

7

ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under

8

Rule 68.

9

court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or

There is nothing in that rule that gives the

10

even implicitly, because it talks about an entire

11

procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of

12

it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the

13

entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only

14

after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing.
So I can't see anything but an inherent

15
16

power.

So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it

17

has to be under a default judgment because the other

18

side is saying, I give up.

19

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. KATYAL:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

That -- that's precisely right.
Let's go from there, at

23

least with me, and that may answer an earlier question

24

about an inquest on damages because that is a part of

25

the requirements for a default judgment, so that if
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is a dispute about damages, that can be resolved.

2

But my point is that liability is admitted.

3

Now, let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice

4

Scalia's question, which is in what ways is this

5

comparable to a shared cost, like what motivated our

6

decision in class actions, that the settlement of one

7

existing plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action.

8

How is this similar to that?

9

MR. KATYAL:

So we think that the corpus of

10

cases that this Court has handled in the class action

11

area, such as Geraghty and Gerstein and the like, we

12

don't think that they absolutely control this question.

13

I don't want to say that.

14

But we think that they set up two principles

15

that help inform the Court's judgment.

16

that, when you have circumstances like this, in which a

17

claim has gone away as moot because the named

18

representative of the claim has gone away for one reason

19

or another, there is play in the joints.

20

The first is

Essentially, you can have a bridge plaintiff

21

who acts to keep the case alive for purposes of letting

22

the class unfold.

23

Rehnquist was getting at in his decision in Roper.

24

we think there is a lot of force to that because,

25

otherwise, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the collective

That's really what then-Justice

34
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

action mechanism doesn't even get off the ground.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you -- you don't

3

accept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 --

4

216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you

5

can commence a suit on behalf of others similarly

6

situated, and implicit in that is that there be some

7

decent interval for you to find similarly-situated

8

people?

9

MR. KATYAL:

We absolutely agree with that,

10

and we think that's precisely the problem.

11

case illustrates it, Justice Ginsburg, because they --

12

we filed their complaint, and 75 days later, they filed

13

their preemptive Rule 68 offer.

14

coming before the Court and saying something even more

15

radical than I think any court has accepted, to my

16

knowledge, which is even filing a class certification

17

motion along with the complaint wouldn't be enough.

18

And this

And now, they are

That is something that would essentially cut

19

the heart out of the collective action mechanism

20

altogether.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why didn't -- why didn't

22

you file the -- the motion for certification, along with

23

the complaint?

24
25

MR. KATYAL:

Because the text of Rule -- of

216(b) provides for two different processes, both the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

filing of the complaint and then a subsequent opt-in

2

process.

3

what the Seventh Circuit has said to do in a case called

4

Damasco, but this Court's decision in Hoffman-LaRoche

5

says the entire collective action mechanism depends on

6

notice and discovery to find out who those people are,

7

to find out and make sure that they are similarly --

8

I suppose we could have done that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's

But you could -- you

9

could have done that with the complaint and I don't --

10

you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to

11

wait?

12

logical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a

13

collective action, and now, we want to start the ball

14

rolling in getting certification?

This Court, in McLaughlin, I think,

essentially said that it's not about the timing of when

68, the Court said, "The fact the class was not

certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had

22

become moot does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you're

5

at what document are we interpreting?

6

7

Is there a

So I could come back to the statute.

And

8

Congress could deprive -- could provide exactly the

9

system that you suggest.

I don't see anything

10

unconstitutional about it.

11

to read this statute as providing that mechanism, since

12

what it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it

13

says what it says in the last two sentences.

14
15

But isn't it a little hard

How do we read that to foresee the mechanism
that you're talking about?

16

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

I take it this is

17

Mr. Mann's point, that people who aren't yet opted into

18

a class are not parties, and, therefore, the Court can't

19

properly consider them.

20

exact thing in the class action context, is this

21

question --

22

And I think that's the same

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, he says the

23

difference in the class action context is, in the class

24

action context, you can consider them there, but there

25

isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute, which

says, no one shall be a party unless he signs in

2

writing.

3

MR. KATYAL:

Your -- Your Honor, I think

4

nothing turns on their designation as party status or

5

not; rather, the relation-back doctrine, to the extent

6

the Court wants to get into it and deem this offer where

7

we got nothing, somehow, they want to deem it against

8

us, but if it does and wants to get into the

9

relation-back doctrine, I think it would find that it is

10

based on the idea that the cases would otherwise go

11

away, and that you need a bridge plaintiff --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. KATYAL:

14

17

Well, why?

Why?

And it's a very important

reason -JUSTICE BREYER:

Because that's -- why?

Why, is my question?
MR. KATYAL:

The reason for that goes back

18

to this Court's decision in Flast -- in Flast, in which

19

it said that, in the kinds of cases we're talking about

20

here, it's not as if we're risking a merits judgment in

21

which relief is going to be imposed against one party

22

and possibly trench on the separation of powers.

23

Rather, the worst that happens, if you rule

24

for us, or if you rule for the plaintiffs in those

25

cases, is that the case goes back down on remand to find
39

out whether or not any of those parties can be

2

identified and come forward.

7

traditionally handles.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it's hard for me to

9

accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes

10

when -- when it's clear, under the statute, that if

11

parties come in beyond the statute of limitations

12

period, they're not in.

here.

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

actually --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. KATYAL:

25

And we think,

I know you do.

And -- and, Justice Scalia, we

think that that statute of limitations argument cuts the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other way.

2

So the statute of limitations provision,

3

which is Section 255, says that, "in determining when an

4

act is commenced for purposes of the statute," and so we

5

don't think it bears on the question or not of whether

6

relation back applies.

7

Much to the contrary, the real worry in the

8

class action context -- and, indeed, my friend's opening

9

line is, "These cases are going to linger forever, and

10

the defendants are going to have no tool."

11

But in the Fair Labor Standards Act context,

12

actually, it's the very reverse because every day counts

13

against the plaintiffs and their counsel.

14

incentivized to bring these cases quickly because the

15

clock is literally ticking.

16

They are

And so you don't have, I think, the same

17

worry that you do in the regular class action context of

18

one plaintiff, who can essentially save the day for all

19

of the different -- for all of the different parties.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

Mr. Katyal, if we do get to

21

the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend

22

a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about

Rehnquist said in Roper.

And it's for the reasons that then-Justice

5

Here -- here is what he said -- this is at

6

445 US 341.

"The distinguishing feature here is that

7

the defendant has made an unaccepted offer.

The action

15

16

And it's the same point.

He is talking

there about a retrospective action for damages.

that particular question about the contours of the

22

with respect to the second question?

23

MR. KATYAL:

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. KATYAL:

Sure.
Should I -- yes.

I think that the best way to

1

think about it is the -- the category of cases from

2

Geraghty, Gerstein, and Swisher suggest that if the --

3

if you wanted to hold that offer against us, that you

4

would then say, as Judge Sirica did, the relation-back

5

doctrine looks similar enough to the 216(b) context in

6

this specific area because, otherwise, the 216(b)

7

collective actions won't work the way Congress intended

8

them to work.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, should I assume that

10

this is the same -- the case would then be the same as

11

if a default judgment had been entered in your favor for

12

that amount?

13

MR. KATYAL:

I think -- well, it's hard to

14

know how you'd hold that offer against us, in that --

15

and the way in which you did so, I think, informs that

16

second question.

17

think it is a predicate question.

And that's part of the reason why we

18

I suppose that, yes, you could say -- one

19

path available is to say it is a default judgment now

20

that is imposed on us, along the lines of the Second

21

Circuit decision; and, if so, then, as the Solicitor

22

General says, at pages 15 to 18, the then-appropriate

course would have been for the district court to

And it is a past -Even though the -- the

employer gave him the paycheck.

He just didn't cash it,

6

plus the damage is for the 3 days.

7

MR. YANG:

If I can just finish, I think it

8

is a past injury.

It is traceable to the defendant, and

9

it is redressable because the requested relief would

10

redress it.

11

It may well be that there was payment.

12

there could be accord and satisfaction --

13

There may well be a defense on the merits.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It could --

I'm not sure I

14

understand.

You think there is a live case, not if he

15

doesn't cash it, but I guess, as Justice Breyer was

16

asking, if it's a day late?

17

there was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it --

18

you know, could be redressed, by telling him what?

20

You -- you said, well,

important to distinguish between injury and something

that redresses an injury.

relevant in Article III, whether the requested relief

from the court would redress the injury.

Now -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

check?

15

MR. YANG:

No, certainly not.

And this is

16

what -- what we say is the right approach, although it's

17

not a question of mootness, if an employer comes in and

18

throws up their hands in court and says, it's not worth

19

it, I want to forfeit, I want to just pay the

20

judgment -- and -- and by the way, this would not have

the issue preclusive effect, notwithstanding my friend's

4

dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't

It might be compensation for the injury.

would -- once a past injury occurs, it's there.

When you -- when you seek injunctive relief, you need

about is imputing into this process, a fairness hearing,

11

essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine

12

whether this is a quirky case where you entered a

13

judgment and you don't need a collective action or

14

whether or not this is a genuine case that requires

15

joining plaintiffs.

MR. YANG:

May I answer the question,

Mr. Chief Justice?

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. YANG:

Certainly.

I don't think it's a fairness

20

hearing.

I think what it does is -- it -- it's a

21

question about whether there are people similarly

22

situated.

23

situated, the case should proceed.

24

the defendant wants to pay everyone, it certainly could

25

do so.

And if there are plaintiffs similarly

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

I think the most useful thing to do is to

12

address the point that Justice Breyer has raised several

13

times because I think it's important to discuss the

14

relationship between what I would call the statutory

15

facts and the constitutional questions that they might

16

raise.

17

think about this as a statutory case.

And so I do think it's fair, in a sense, to

18

When a plaintiff files suit in a Federal

19

court, often, the cause of action rests on a statute

20

that Congress has adopted.

21

attributes that Congress can control to make it easier

22

or harder for a defendant to make an offer of complete

23

relief.

24
25

Those statutes have a lot of

They can provide for mandatory shifting of
attorneys' fees, as this one does.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

They can alter the

Official

1

rules for shifting costs, as perhaps the Fair Debt

2

Collection Practices Act does from last month.

3

provide for injunctive or declaratory relief, which

4

makes it basically impossible.

5

They can

But Congress gets to decide, when they write

6

a statute, whether they want to make it a statute for

7

which it --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

That's true.

9

And so what we would be reading into this statute is a

10

relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the

11

week in class action cases and has historical analogies.

12

So I understand the difference you're

13

pointing to, but why not read that in?

14

fair, and it would get the job done, that Congress sets

15

up in the statute.

16

It would be

That's the argument the other way.

MR. MANN:

Well, that leads me to the second

17

point I wanted to make, which is exactly what is the

18

constitutional problem.

19

it is when my colleague, Mr. Katyal, refers to the worst

20

that happens, well, the worst that happens, I think

21

it's -- it's important to understand what the worst

22

thing is that happens.

23

And I think the way to get to

The worst thing is -- that happens is the

24

case is on the docket of the Federal district judge, and

25

there is no plaintiff with an interest, and the
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedure in the district court is we should spend some

2

time, have some discovery, look around to see if we can

3

find another plaintiff.

4

And so I think that that's a different

5

problem from how the district court should decide the

6

order of hearing -- of deciding motions.

7

is --

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the problem

Mr. Mann, if this is --

if what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be

13

is defendant's voluntary cessation doesn't moot a

14

16

the plaintiff's got this judgment, not preclusive.

21

MR. MANN:

This seems to me to fit exactly
If there is no issue

So I spoke unartfully before.

24

Obviously, there is a difference between claim

25

preclusion and issue preclusion.

And what I was

attempting to say, unartfully, I will agree, was the

extent of preclusion will depend on the issues that are

That's the claim.
