Mr. Rothfeld?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed

12

that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity

13

of water that is located in Oklahoma.

14

trying to back out of that bargain.

15

Oklahoma is now

What its argument to this Court in support

16

of its position is essentially that the Court should

17

disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact

18

because that language is superfluous, that the Court

19

should read into the Compact language that does not

20

appear there, and that the Court should not give the

21

text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes

22

as "talismanic significance."

23
24
25

Our very different view is that the plain
text of the Compact must control.
Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to

2

allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River

3

Basin.

4

called reaches and subdivides the reaches into

5

subbasins.

6

expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line.

7

It says that the States may use the water within their

8

boundaries exclusively.

The Compact divides that basin into large areas

As to some of those areas, the Compact

9

But in the section of the Compact which is

10

at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a

11

very different and unique language.

12

that subbasin includes the territory of all -- three of

13

the four compacting States.

14

subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference

15

to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries

16

to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river

17

itself.

18

That section --

The boundaries of that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rothfeld, we are told

19

that in other compacts when they really mean to give one

20

State the right to take another State's water, the

21

provision in the compact is much clearer, much more

22

definite.

23

This clause, the one that you rely on, is

24

kind of sketchy, isn't it?

25

going to get it, if they're going to pay for it.

Doesn't say how they're

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

There's a lot to be filled in.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, the provision that we

3

are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all.

4

is quite clear that all four of the compacting States

5

are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to

6

the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the

7

subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent

8

of the water.

9

is required.

10
11
12

It

That -- that is quite express as to what

In -- it's difficult to read that language
to mean anything other than that the States can take -JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is the exact language?

13

Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh

14

our recollection?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

The exact language -- it appears

16

-- it is reprinted on page 8 of the blue brief in the

17

indented text, and it says, "Within this -- within this

18

subbasin, the signatory States have equal rights to the

19

use of," and then it defines the water that they have the

20

rights to the use of, "at times of normal flow" -- with

21

the flow of the Red River at 3,000 cubic feet per second

22

at the Arkansas/Louisiana border -- "provided that no

23

State is entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in

24

excess of this amount."

25

So the -- the gist of the language is States
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have -- all -- all four signatory States have equal

2

rights to the use of --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say that.

It

4

says, "No State is entitled to more than 25 percent."

5

It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what

6

happens if in fact there's a State that because of

7

cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it

8

is entitled.

9
10

MR. ROTHFELD:

13

Well, I have to disagree with

that.

11
12

It just doesn't say anything about it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where does it say something

about it?
MR. ROTHFELD:

It says that -- the section

14

is designed to allocate the water of the subbasin, and

15

it says, "Within the subbasin, States have equal rights

16

to use of the runoff."

That's the first part of it.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes.
The second part of it then

19

says, "provided that no State is entitled to more than

20

25 percent" --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Does that mean

22

that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the

23

river, go into some other State and take the water out

24

of that other State?

25

that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for

I mean, I would have thought, if

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doing it.

2

Compact that would decide where, whether it's really

3

true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no

4

such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which

5

it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State

6

courts in different States to try to do what is an

7

extremely complex and controversial administrative job.

8
9

That you'd have some authority set up by the

MR. ROTHFELD:
that.

10

A couple points to say about

First of all, it is not at all a complex job.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not at all complex

11

when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to

12

the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say,

13

I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus.

14

And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in

15

fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are

16

going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs

17

to us.

18

And Texas will say, no, we aren't.

And then

19

we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into

20

the river at different places and what are all these

21

different pipelines are going to take out.

22

understand what I'm saying.

23

MR. ROTHFELD:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.

You

But --

I would have thought a

mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

Okay.

Again, several things

2

about that.

3

to which Justice Ginsburg alludes that are cited by our

4

opponents, which expressly allow for cross-border --

5

virtually none of them provide any of the kinds of

6

details that you are describing.

7

First of all, in all these other compacts

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

But they do say

8

expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in

9

the other areas.

And here it does not say anything

10

about it.

11

because all it says is you can't take more than

12

25 percent.

13

unable to get its 25 percent from the south.

14

repeating myself, but you point to the language that

15

says what I just say is not consistent with the

16

language.

17

That's why I think we're here in the Court

It doesn't say what happens when Texas is

MR. ROTHFELD:

I'm now

What I say -- I guess I will

18

say two things about that.

19

say is, in fact, with respect, is not consistent with

20

the language.

21
22
23

One, I think what you just

I think that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which language is it not

consistent with?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Equal rights to use of

24

specified water.

25

again, not by State lines, it's defined by -- by

It -- the -- the subbasin is defined,

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

downstream dam sites.

2

in the -- in this subbasin, and it says that all four

3

States have equal rights to use of this water, provided

4

that none takes more than 25 percent.

So it has created a pool of water

5

It seems to me that on the face of it, that

6

is saying State lines are not relevant and that what we

7

are looking at is a pool of water the States can come

8

and get it.

9

And it is particularly so -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Excuse me.

If I may just -- I'm sorry.
No, no.

Finish.

But I --

And I think to the extent

13

that there could be any ambiguity in the -- in that

14

language viewed in isolation, in the context of the rest

15

of the Compact, there are places where the drafters of

16

the Compact, in fact, did refer to State lines.

17

said that States are entitled to use the water within

18

their State boundaries, in the respective States may use

19

the water within their boundaries.

20

framers did not use that language in this provision.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They

They did not -- the

I think under your

22

argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that

23

Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the

24

flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right

25

into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent.

2

Does that make sense in terms of the language?

3
4

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I will say two things

to that --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, you're talking

6

about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be

7

a little easier to cross the borderline.

8

Louisiana going to do?

9
10
11

MR. ROTHFELD:

But what's

Well, let me make two points

about that.
First of all, I think that not only does it

12

make sense in the language, it's compelled by the

13

language because the language says within this subbasin

14

all four States have equal rights.

15

another separate reach.

16

is Louisiana's, and so the water flows into Louisiana.

17

When the water gets to Louisiana, it's no longer within

18

the subbasin, it's somewhere else.

19

Separately, there is

Reach V of the -- the Compact

So the plain language of the Compact compels

20

the reading -- compels the -- the point that Louisiana

21

could take its water from within the subbasin.

22

Now, could it do that?

The subbasin runs

23

through to Arkansas to Louisiana, so it could go to

24

Louisiana --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Go back to the first one

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because what you have done is you've pushed me back to

2

the equal rights.

3

it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal

4

rights to water arising within its boundaries.

5

you have to say is equal rights to water arising

6

anywhere in the subbasin.

7

And now if I am going to fight you on

And all

And if I just heard that, then I might say

8

okay, I think yours is a little better.

9

have this enormous administrative mess that would seem

But -- but we

10

to be created, and both those interpretations seem

11

possible.

12

So let's go back to that and let me hear

13

quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the

14

answer?

15
16
17

MR. ROTHFELD:

If I may just finish with

Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that?
I think the second answer to the question

18

is, the States are going to take the water from the

19

closest point where they can get it.

20

is not going to go to Oklahoma.

21

into Subbasin 5, it's going to go to Arkansas directly

22

across the State line.

23

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who -- who erects the

facilities to accomplish this diversion?

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

Tarrant presumably will do

18

that.

19

Oklahoma law provides for exercise of eminent domain, or

20

Tarrant can simply purchase the property to do that.

21

If Tarrant needs to obtain rights of way,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's -- it's my

22

understanding that there is a place where Texas can put

23

a line into the river, and then a subset of that

24

question is, the main stem of the river, through --

25

without going through Oklahoma property, other than
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

perhaps just the bank itself.
MR. ROTHFELD:

That -- that I think is not

3

correct as a factual matter.

4

entirely within Oklahoma, and so Oklahoma, in order to

5

get water out of the main stem, if -- if Texas were to

6

do that, it would have to go into Oklahoma.

7

in fact, this is in response to -- in part to what --

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the Red River lies

And -- and

But you say entirely

within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the bank?

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because -Or because of there's also

12

some intervening property between Texas and the bank

13

that Oklahoma owns?

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

The -- the border between

15

Oklahoma and Texas is the south vegetation line of the

16

Red River, so therefore it is out of the river past the

17

bank to the vegetation line.

18

out of the main stem, Oklahoma and -- Texas would have

19

to go into Oklahoma.

Now, there is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At any point, because the
13

Alderson Reporting Company

laws that Tarrant is challenging here are laws that are

2

discriminatory Oklahoma laws that prevent any use of

3

water originating in Oklahoma outside.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you say Texas has the

5

right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that

6

phrase.

7

sounds like they are going to send in the National Guard

8

or the Texas Rangers.

9

That's -- that's very striking.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Right.

I mean, it

And that -- if I may,

10

Justice Alito, that is -- that's a very misleading way

11

of looking at it.

13

seize the water.

14

contemplated.

15

And I think Oklahoma's brief suggests

That is not what -- what is

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you were saying that

16

Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma

17

to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent

18

domain if necessary.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, I -- there is an -- there

20

is an Oklahoma statute that says in order to -- someone

21

who has a permit to obtain water can exercise eminent

22

domain.

23

can do this.

24
25

An Oklahoma person can do this.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does -- how does

Oklahoma apply its law in this situation?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

A Texas person

I assume

Official

1

there is normal priorities and they will get

2

applications from a lot of people.

3

what do they have to give Texas?

4

But they have to -Up to 25 percent?

I mean, they can't just say -- deny it

5

because another Oklahoma user has priority, or all this.

6

How does that fit in with the existing administrative

7

structure?

8
9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, Oklahoma cannot use

more than 25 percent of the water within the subbasin.

10

I think that our friends concede that because the

11

language of the Compact says no State is entitled to

12

more than 25 percent.

13

Within each State's 25 percent allocation, a

14

resident water user of the State will apply to the

15

Oklahoma -- if they are seeking to take their water from

16

Oklahoma, it will apply to the Oklahoma Water Resources

17

Board, which will assess that permit precisely as it

18

assesses permits from Oklahoma residents.

19
20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's got to give

Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right?
MR. ROTHFELD:

If -- if there is a request

22

for that much water from a Texas user, and the Texas

23

user has priority as a permit applicant against others

24

who are seeking to take water from this particular --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
15
Alderson Reporting Company

I guess what I'm

Official

1

asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority

2

apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would

3

be?

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, it does not.

It's --

5

all -- all the Compact says is that Texas is entitled to

6

take water from within the subbasin, its 25 percent.

7

Now when it applies in a particular place, as Tarrant

8

has done here, it's going to apply -- be consistent with

9

the Oklahoma -- Water Resources Board permit application

10

policies, as it has done.

11

The resources board will assess that permit

application just as it would assess an application

from --

How does the Oklahoma board make those
decisions?

MR. ROTHFELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

The court of appeals concluded that Oklahoma
may categorically foreclose Texas water users from

10

accessing Reach II Subbasin 5 water in Oklahoma, and the

11

court reached that conclusion for reasons that in the

12

view of the United States are wrong.

13

First, the Court of Appeals erred in

14

applying a presumption against preemption to determine

15

whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the

16

Compact.

17

has been applied is one of federalism, but the States

18

themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact,

and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context

terms.

The rationale for that presumption where it

Second, the court of appeals relied on

23

general Compact provisions to conclude that the Compact

24

gives States unrestricted authority to regulate the

25

water within their boundaries.

But the general

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's

2

regulation of water has to be consistent with the

3

allocations made under the Compact, and each State's

4

obligations under the Compact.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I am not quite

6

sure I agree with your reading of the Court of Appeals'

7

opinion.

8

is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they

looked at the terms of the Compact.

that the Compact either says you get the water or you

12

don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just

13

irrelevant.

14

appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition.

15

You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact.

16

dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have

17

much to do with it.

18

But I read the opinion of the court of

MS. O'CONNELL:

The

Well, we agree with that.

We don't think that the dormant Commerce Clause comes

23

them that right or not.

39A, when it starts talking about the point of --

2

Section 5.05.

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

Right.

And we don't

4

disagree with that, that the -- that the commerce clause

5

shouldn't come into play here.

6

Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals

7

is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that,

8

regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the

9

purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its

10

share of water under the Compact, that that State law

11

should prevail under the Compact.

12

clear that those general provisions preserving State

13

water law need to be consistent with each State's

14

obligations under the Compact.

15

And if I could --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the Compact makes

Well, where, if

17

you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do

18

you come up with this idea that States first have to try

19

to get their 25 percent from water within their borders?

20

I don't see that anywhere.

21

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, first of all, we think

22

that that's an issue that, if the Court decided that --

23

that there are errors in the Court of Appeals' opinion

24

that should be corrected, we think that's something the

25

court of -- that the lower courts could consider on
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

remand.

2

But I'll tell you where it comes from, which

3

is Sections 2.01 and 2.10(a) of the Compact, which

4

preserve the application of State water law.

5

2.01 says that, "Each State may freely administer water

6

rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that

7

State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to

8

the availability of water in accordance with the

9

Compact."

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Section

Well, it seems to me

11

that you like some provisions of State law, but not

12

others.

13

MS. O'CONNELL:

No.

What we're saying is

14

that if there's a State law that conflicts with the

15

allocation or poses an obstacle to the allocation of

16

water under the Compact, then it's preempted.

17

But, for example, if Texas could access

18

25 percent of the water from within its State, then

19

the -- the application of a State law that would bar

20

Texas water users from obtaining a portion of its water

21

in Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be preempted because it

22

wouldn't pose an obstacle to the allocation.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do --

24

what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's

25

Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas.

2

Do they have to incur the additional expense to get

3

Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get

4

Oklahoma water?

5

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, we think -- again, we

6

think this is a -- an issue for the court of -- for the

7

lower courts to look at on remand, but we think there's

8

a -- there's a good argument to be made that, so long as

9

Texas could access 25 percent of the water within its

10

boundaries, then application of an Oklahoma law that

11

would prohibit Texas from going through the Oklahoma

12

permitting process wouldn't necessarily be preempted.

13

And again, we -- these -- these -- there are

14

lots of issues, as we point out in our brief and we did

15

at the invitation stage, that would need to be

16

addressed, perhaps, in further proceedings or perhaps

17

before the --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a

19

reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view?

20

if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out

21

that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty

22

of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you

23

submitted, it gives you kind of a headache.

24

that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult

25

the process is.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

That --

Official

1

And then you look at this provision, and

2

maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but

3

it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer

4

suggested, be read as a cap, "no more than 25 percent."

5

So as between those two possible readings,

6

the complexity of your way of reading this, which would

7

have -- why?

8
9

MS. O'CONNELL:

Justice Kagan, I'd like to,

if I could, go to the second point, which is on the --

10

the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement

11

or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just

12

to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in

13

favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an

14

equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the

15

water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just

16

an opportunity.

17

But the interpretive comments that follow

18

Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint

19

Appendix -- refer to a "right."

20

paragraph there says, "When the flows" -- I'm sorry,

21

it's the -- the second line.

22

competing uses and the amount of water available in

23

excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all

24

such uses, each State will honor the other State's right

25

to 25 percent of the excess flow."

The first full

"If the States have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The Red River Compact Commission also

2

approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're

3

on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix.

4

have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong.

5

I might

But the -- the Red River Compact

6

Commission's rules and regulations say that when the

7

flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that

8

Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second,

9

"each of the signatory States shall be entitled to

10
11

25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow."
So I think it -- it's pretty clear that

12

based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the

13

interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River

14

Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just

15

that you can take whatever is in your borders even if

16

that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each

17

State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that

18

if that involves going into another State within this

19

geographic area that's not defined with respect to State

20

boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact.

21

And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the

22

States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in

23

the Compact, they did so.

24

that span more than one geographic -- or more than one

25

State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you

There are several subbasins

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can take whatever you want within your boundaries.

2

And I also don't think that this is going to

3

be particularly troublesome to administer.

4

there may need to be some further proceedings on that,

5

but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would

6

happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for

7

a permit to appropriate and divert water from within

8

Oklahoma.

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean,

And what does that mean?

What would Oklahoma do?

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, the Oklahoma Water

12

Resources Board would just apply its normal procedures

13

and laws to determine whether this particular use of

14

water could be put to beneficial use.

15

just apply whatever laws they would apply to any

16

applicant, regardless of whether they are from Texas or

17

Oklahoma.

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

What does

Well, I think just as -- as

4

Petitioner's counsel pointed out, there's a -- a

5

priority in water law, where whoever submits the

6

application first would -- would get the water if it's

7

available and they can put it to beneficial use.

8
9

And I -- and I -- the Court shouldn't be
concerned.

I know all -- I know there are amicus briefs

10

submitted by other Texas entities that would like to

11

have water from this particular subbasin as well.

12

They're all part of the same Region C, and they -- I

13

think they have some way to work it out.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's not --

Well, I don't understand

15

your answer.

17

applicants in order to make sure that Texas got its

18

share of the water?

If -- if you're correct, wouldn't the

It couldn't just treat -- it couldn't just

20

be indifferent as to whether it was an Oklahoma or Texas

21

applicant.

22

MS. O'CONNELL:

That -- true, to the extent

23

that Texas was not receiving its water.

24

under -- under our theory, which we think could be

25

developed more in the lower courts, if Texas was already
26
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

1

receiving 25 percent of the water, then Oklahoma would

2

not have to give it any kind of special priority.

3

if it -- if it was not, then the Oklahoma Water

4

Resources Board would treat it just like an Oklahoma

5

applicant.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it correct that -- that

7

there are reservoirs in Texas that flow into -- from

which water is released into the Red River?

MS. O'CONNELL:

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that

water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose

not to do so, so it could take other water out of the

9

but also in Arkansas, where they might get some.

10

And in that instance,

And all my question, and I think that was

11

being asked, is there anything else you want to say as

12

to why that's an easy matter to decide?

13

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I -- it's -- we don't

14

think it needs to be decided in this particular

15

proceeding.

16

I think there are two errors that the Court

17

of Appeals made in applying a presumption against

18

preemption and in concluding that a Texas water user

19

could never divert water from outside of its State.

20

Those could be developed -- those additional problems

21

could be dealt with by the Oklahoma Water Resources

And if you see, all the way down to Lake Texarkana, they

has ever done any accounting because the Equal Rights

20

Clause has always been read as equal rights to the use

21

of the water without prejudice to or from each other's

22

State, and, in that sense, it means that if one State

23

took an earlier use of the water, it wouldn't gain a

priority indefinitely over the other States.

engineers ran the numbers after correcting their

4

three-series method -- methodological errors, and we

5

came up with 29 percent.

They -- they double-counted streams.

forgot that Subbasin 5 is not only runoff but also rain.

And then -- this one's humorous -- they didn't count the

excess.

10

So all the -- all the math that they did

favored Texas, so the math didn't come out that way.

But what's interesting about the Tarrant's

Tarrant's view is it could have all the water, but they

I understand your point to the Chief

that there's been no proof that Texas doesn't get its

25 percent or that it couldn't get it from the main stem

12

or somewhere.

I accept that.

there's a major drought and Texas can't get it from its

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Their view, the

Well, this is a -- a

19

perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I

20

want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question.

21

At least as I understood it, it's this, I

22

want you to assume -- I know you don't agree with

24

Texas a right to 25 percent of the -- of the excess --

25

of the water above the cubic foot.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BLATT:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The excess, yeah.
I want you to assume that.

3

Now, wouldn't the Compact be meaningless if Texas

4

couldn't actually reach that water?

5

MS. BLATT:

That is -- that is the United

6

States' view, and they'd have to go above it.

7

would have to do, which no one else -- no one has

8

done -- and I think the drafters thought it was

9

ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana,

What they

10

is call for an accounting and actually figure out what

11

the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up

12

the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to

13

happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to

14

the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in

15

fact ever happen because of the riparian laws of

16

Arkansas and Louisiana.

17

But -- so in other words, if we lost this

18

case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the

19

United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a

20

pickle trying to prove they couldn't get their

21

25 percent.

dare send us back to try to prove that.

We want to be

24

And if I could get to the point that Justice

25

Kagan was talking about, what's on the ground happening,
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of

2

cross-border right because what Tarrant is doing is

3

exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the

4

assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust

5

that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma.

6

And there are three ways where Oklahoma

7

would not have agreed to this, and it would have been

8

carefully articulated in a Compact.

9

The first is prior appropriation.

There are

12

Irving and Tarrant.

And poor Oklahoma City got

And so not surprisingly, it's open season

16

for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and

17

sought a permit and there's priority.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's the same

19

problem.

20

people, if they were applying for water in Texas as

21

well, there'd be the same issue there.

22

would beat the other one.

23

You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should

24

have -- well, not absolute priority, but --

25

Even if you take within State, all of these

MS. BLATT:

One of them

It's a question of priority.

Well, I have two points.
43

Alderson Reporting Company

First,

Official

1

had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't

2

heard about this until Tarrant filed its application,

3

Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line

4

faster.

5

6

apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water

7

first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently --

8

this was the point of the Compact.

9

Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and

And second of all, the whole point of this

Louisiana and

10

Oklahoma were much more economically developed States,

11

and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit

12

office.

13

Let me get to the second aspect what's a

14

problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the

15

points of diversion.

16

picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River,

17

and Tarrant is saying, not surprisingly, it's the most

18

desirable.

19

The last place Oklahoma would have

And the third is the eminent domain.

20

Eminent domain law in Oklahoma proceeds on the

21

assumption that those are Oklahomans who got the permit,

22

and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and

23

Tarrant, not surprisingly, would like to come in and do

24

that.

25

there's a better use for Oklahoma.

22

So

And there's a

Now, I hope you ask them this because I

23

gather their view is under the dormant Commerce Clause

24

is all of those laws are constitutional with respect to

25

99 percent of the Compact, which is it's allocated to -45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to Oklahoma for its free and unrestricted use.

2

they're basically saying there's 1 percent of this

3

Compact that's unconstitutional.

4

So

And not only is it 1 percent, the minute it

5

drops below 3,000, all of a sudden, it became.

6

this, we'd like to talk to the Russello principle.

7

also hope you ask them, this is on page 15A of -- 14A of

8

the 15A brief.

9

and they're missing, they're there.

10

And on
I

There are border references arbitrarily
It's completely

inconsistent.

11

And this -- their view would make complete

12

mincemeat out of 4 other provisions of the Compact.

13

ironically, it would march a lot of States into Texas.

14

But back to (b) -- (b)(2) and 5.05(c) operate identical

15

in that they're basically downstream delivery, where all

States have to release 40 percent of the water

This is a provision that -- this is

So you have a big chunk of Texas, and Texas

20

is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40.

21

under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to

22

borders and because Oklahoma is not in this Reach, it's

23

not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma

24

either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water

25

from Texas.

Now,

And this pattern repeats itself -- this is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on page 41 of our brief -- throughout the Compact, where

2

the Compact is silent as to borders, and under their

3

view -- and their Louisiana view is somewhat

4

entertaining.

5

I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go

6

into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border

7

to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under

8

this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the

9

contract -- the State that's not in the basin because

10

there are no borders and because, I guess under their

11

view, the only way that Oklahoma to get its water would

12

be to go into Texas, and that's why they're sort of

13

taking this bit about, oh, this Russello principle, if

14

it's here, it must mean -- it must have had

15

significance, would make a complete mess of the Compact.

16

If I could also just turn to the remand of

17

the United States.

three points.

that it's pointed -- it is addressed to a problem that

20

Texas itself has never asserted.

21

No other State is going to have this problem because the

24

rest are downstream.

apparently at the same time for 20 years of drafting

3

history when Texas was trying to buy this water, and the

4

three States were saying, no way, no how, they either

5

subconsciously or unconsciously or unintentionally

6

enacted this provision for Texas's benefit.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Subbasin 1, that's

8

mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or

9

the other way around?

10

in Oklahoma.

I mean, how -- there must

Justice Breyer, you have to

words -MS. BLATT:

No measurements have ever been

11

taken with respect to this.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

So that -- I don't

13

know how that cuts because certainly the people who drew

14

this must have thought at least in those other

15

provisions they are going to develop a measurement

16

system in case of controversy.

17

MS. BLATT:

Well, there are gauges.

So

18

they -- I mean, it would not be impossible, although

19

very expensive.

20

in the interpretive comments of 211, the State said the

21

last thing we want is this accounting because it's

22

expensive and burdensome.

23

if you look at the minutes, they are complaining because

24

their laws are not set up for accounting.

25

riparian States, so they don't track diversions.

And just so you know, Section 211, and

And Louisiana and Arkansas,

50
Alderson Reporting Company

They are
They

just -- they don't do it.

3

So this was -- this is -- when you talk
about how this cuts, you have 20 years of silence --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I don't understand

5

what you just said, "They're riparian States, so they

6

don't track diversions."

7

MS. BLATT:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MS. BLATT:

Okay.

So when you comment -Why does that follow?

Right.

Okay.

So in the -- the

10

Oklahoma and Texas, in their permitting system, what

11

they permit, they track how much you take under the

12

permit.

They measure.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MS. BLATT:

Okay.

Louisiana, if you are a

15

landowner, you just draw from the water and it's a --

16

it's a voluntary reporting system, so you don't

17

necessarily have to tell the State how much you took

18

out.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MS. BLATT:

Okay.

So one is a permitting system,

21

and in Louisiana and Arkansas -- and, I think, again,

22

the minutes just talk about we hope Louisiana and

23

Arkansas will develop their laws to do better tracking

24

of diversions.

an accounting.

5

argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us

11

rights, to allow for an extraordinary right, they would

12

have made an explicit statement and then spelled out

13

exactly what that meant, most importantly the point of

14

diversion.

15

Here, at most you have silence on the issue.
Now, the government reads into borders

16

sometimes because they say you do have borders unless

17

there is a need.

18

the most jarring and remarkable view, this is all a

19

borderless common, and every State could have

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Blatt, the solicitor

17

where the language of entitlement and rights was used.

Do you have a view as -- as to that?

MS. BLATT:

So they -- you mean the two

compliance rules they cited?

because what they cited disproved what they were trying

Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for

with the notion that they had this right all along.

They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

18

Just a couple of points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, my friend, Ms.

19

Blatt, said that it would make mincemeat and a complete

20

mess out of the Compact to apply its terms as they were

21

written.

22

a period of 25 years.

23

Appendix, you will very painfully see that there are

24

reams and reams of commentary on the -- on the

25

negotiations.

We think that this Compact was negotiated over
If you look at the Joint

1

I think the Court has to assume that when

2

the drafters of the Compact used language and referred

3

to State lines in one place and not in another place,

4

they had some idea of what they were doing and they made

5

these different choices intentionally.

6

Court simply should read the terms of the Compact --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I think the

So how do you deal with

8

all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to

9

the 60/40 division?

I can't make rhyme or reason of

10

those provisions that don't use within State boundaries,

11

but it has to mean that.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I don't think that it

13

has to mean that.

14

15

16

down.

If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to

If not, they can just wait for the water to flow

17

I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt

18

did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5

19

operates.

20

to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about

21

here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but

22

extremely narrow.

23

south for most of its length.

24
25

If you look at the map that was pointed out

It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to

The reason the drafters drew this is because
the States all take -- the assumption was all of the

water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water,

2

literally excess water.

3

that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so

4

the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to

5

by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1, they are not in

6

Subbasin 5.

7

water that the States assumed was going to be surplus.

8

And so it would make no sense, having divided this water

9

evenly between the compacting States, to think that the

The States all take the water

The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is

10

drafters would have required a water user in Texas at

11

the far west end, which would get its portion of the

12

25 percent share two miles across the border in

13

Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to

14

get it out of Texas.

15

That is not what the drafters intended to

16

accomplish by this.

17

the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined

18

by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State

19

equal rights to access that water so long as they did

20

not use more than 25 percent.

21

They created, by the plain terms of

Your response to a question which was raised

22

by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the

They're going to go

It makes no sense to

10

require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it.

11

Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the

25 percent limitation out of the Compact.

13

reading reads the equal rights language out of the

14

Compact.

15
