CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will now hear

argument in Case 11-192, United States v. Bormes.
Mr. Srinivasan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This Court's decisions have long established

11

that Congress will be deemed to have waived the

12

Government's sovereign immunity only if it unequivocally

13

expresses its intent to do so.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Under your view, is

15

there any situation today where the Tucker Act would be

16

applied to a statute?

17

statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing

18

us to, and we're only looking for a clear waiver of

19

sovereign immunity, then there’ll never be another

20

Tucker Act action in the future.

21
22
23
24
25

Because if we start with the

MR. SRINIVASAN:
Justice Sotomayor.

There are such statutes,

Of course --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would they look

like to be able to get around our clear statement rule?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, they would have two

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

features consistent with this Court's decisions that

2

have found the Tucker Act to be applicable.

3

be that the statute does not contain its own remedial

4

mechanism, and the second would be that the substantive

5

obligations in the statute run against the United

6

States, and the United States alone.

7

One would

And an example of that type of statute is

8

the one that this Court found to be supported by the

9

Tucker Act in White Mountain Apache Tribe or in Mitchell

10

II.

11

the Tucker Act was meant to apply.

12

Those are the kinds of statutes as to which I think

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So basically -- I'm not

13

sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act

14

jurisdiction.

15

the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives

16

sovereign immunity --

We should have really just been briefing

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20
21
22

Well, of course --- because that becomes,

to you, the operative question.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

It does when they're

dealing with the statute like this.
And, of course, the reason that we’re

23

addressing Tucker Act immunity is because Tucker Act

24

immunity is the basis for jurisdiction in this case

25

according to the reasoning of the Federal circuit.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And the problem with the reasoning of the

2

Federal circuit is it allows the litigant to readily

3

circumvent the Court's strict test for sovereign

4

immunity waivers by the straightforward device of

5

adding the Tucker Act as a jurisdictional basis in the

6

complaint.

7

And it's not at all clear why a plaintiff

8

couldn't do that for any claim under any statute,

9

including a statute as to which this Court would have

10

already concluded that the unequivocal expression test,

11

the standard test applied for waivers of sovereign

12

immunity, was not satisfied.

13

Now, to give the Court a concrete example of

14

this, in Lane v. Pena, the court concluded that for

15

Rehabilitation Act claims under Section 504 of the

16

Rehabilitation Act, there was no unequivocal expression

17

of an intent to waive sovereign immunity by Congress for

18

purposes of damages claims; and, therefore, a

19

damages claim can't be brought against the United States

20

under Section 504.

21

But under the Federal circuit's approach,

22

there’s no apparent reason why a plaintiff couldn't

23

bring a damages claim against the United States for a

24

violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by

25

adding the Tucker Act to the jurisdictional bases in the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complaint.

2

that, notwithstanding this Court's decision in

3

Lane V. Pena, the result would be that the plaintiff

4

could say, the Federal circuit, you should look at the

5

statute and ask the question whether it can be fairly

6

interpreted to mandate the payment of money by the

7

Government.

8
9

Because if the plaintiff were able to do

There’s no unequivocal expression of an
intent to waive sovereign immunity, but that doesn't

10

detract from the ability of the Federal circuit to

11

conclude that the statute, nonetheless, can be fairly

12

interpreted to mandate the payment of money.

13

Now, of course, if that issue were to arise,

14

we would make the argument that the statute can't be so

15

read.

16

that argument, notwithstanding this Court's decision in

17

Lane V. Pena, we think reinforces the need to

18

conclude -- to conclude that the Tucker Act can't be

19

applied in the way that the Federal circuit sought to

20

apply it here.

But the possibility that a plaintiff could make

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

Could I ask you -Mr. Srinivasan -I’m sorry, I was going to

ask -- following up on my question --

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- many courts have held

3

that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign

4

immunity.

5

a Tucker Act remedy.

6
7

And many of them have recognized, if not all,

Under your new approach, that holding is
incorrect, I presume --

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

Well, the --- because the FLSA has

its own remedial scheme?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think one -- one way to

12

look at the FLSA, if we're looking at it in the first

13

instance, would be to conclude that the FLSA itself has

14

a waiver of sovereign immunity.

15

look to the Tucker Act as the basis for the waiver of

16

sovereign immunity, and you would look at FSLA in the

17

way that we think you should look at FCRA -- excuse me,

18

the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA.

19

And so you wouldn't

Now, Your Honor is correct that there is a

20

body of court of claims jurisprudence that doesn't

21

necessarily view the statute in that way.

22

apply the framework that we think is the correct one to

23

apply, as we set forth in our brief, you might reach the

24

same conclusion under the Fair Labor Standards Act,

25

although under a slightly different route.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

But if you

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But then the Federal

2

circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according

3

to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its

4

own judicial remedy.

5

go to --

6

They’re not authorized, then, to

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it would depend.

7

There is a little bit of an anomaly in the FLSA because

8

the FLSA doesn't necessarily point to any particular

9

court as the basis of jurisdiction.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It has the same language

11

as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or

12

state court of competent jurisdiction.

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right.

It says:

"In any

14

Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction," but

15

this statute specifically allows for claims to be

16

brought in district courts and a court of competent

17

jurisdiction.

18

So one way --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

I don't know -- I don't

see the difference between -MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think one way to

22

potentially see the difference -- and I'm not going to

23

quibble with -- with what Your Honor's saying, but one

24

way to potentially see a difference is because the FLSA

25

only refers to courts of competent jurisdiction -- it
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doesn't have a free-standing provision that reversed the

2

district courts -- it's possible to read that statute as

3

essentially incorporating the Tucker Act as setting

4

forth what the court of competent jurisdiction would be.

5

Here, 1681(p), which is set forth at 13(a)

6

and 14(a) of the appendix to the Government's brief,

7

speaks specifically about actions being brought under

8

FCRA in any appropriate United States District Court,

9

and then only, it goes on to talk about, or in any other

10
11
12
13

court of competent jurisdiction.
So that's a potential basis for drawing a
distinction between the two.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Srinivasan, what you say

14

has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you

15

know, why should we read the Tucker Act to reverse

16

everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but

17

it's really hard to get that from the text of this --

18

the Tucker Act.

19

In fact -- I mean, I guess my question is:

20

Do you have any textual argument for the result that you

21

are asking us to reach?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

I do, Your Honor.

23

The text of the Tucker Act, it's true, if you read the

24

text to apply to its full potential reach, then the

25

argument would be more difficult; but, the text of the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Tucker Act has never been read that way, including by

2

this Court itself, starting with Nichols v. United

3

States --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's not really a

5

textual argument.

6

sensibly limited the reach of the Tucker Act.

7

Tucker Act does seem to include what your friend there

8

says it includes --

9

That's an argument about how we've

MR. SRINIVASAN:
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

But the

Well, I guess --- against any statute.

11

any statute except the ones with remedial provisions,

12

but just any statute.

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

Not

I guess you -- you

14

-- if you read the Tucker Act to its full textual reach,

15

I think we would have a more difficult case.

16

argument is that when the statute refers to claims

17

founded on any act of Congress, it was never intended to

18

apply literally to any conceivable act of Congress.

19

And, in fact, this Court's own test for money

20

mandating -- the money mandating test that applies to

21

the Tucker Act embodies that understanding because --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But our

I assume you’re appealing

23

to the textual principle that the specific governs the

24

general.

25

Isn't that what's going on here?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

We're appealing --

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That the Tucker Act is a

2

more general provision, and you are saying it's -- it's

3

overcome by a more specific provision that provides for

4

compensation, but excludes the Federal Government.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

We're certainly relying on

6

that, Justice Scalia, when you're asking whether the

7

Tucker Act can be used as the basis for waiving

8

sovereign immunity for claims under the Fair Credit

9

Reporting Act.

So when you bring the Fair Credit

10

Reporting Act into play, yes, we're absolutely relying

11

on the specific versus the general proposition, as this

12

Court has relied on in any number of cases.

13

I guess I understood Justice Kagan's

14

question to be talking about the Tucker Act and the

15

Tucker Act alone, without bringing into play any other

16

statute.

17

to conceive of the Tucker Act in that kind of isolated

18

fashion, because usually you'll be asking a question

19

whether a claim can be brought against the United States

20

under some other statutory regime.

Now, I take Your Honor's point that it's hard

21

And so if that statutory regime includes its

22

own remedial mechanism, as FCRA does, it's hard to avoid

23

resort to the specific control as a general proposition.

24
25

But the other point about construing the
text of the Tucker Act alone is that the Tucker Act is a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

waiver of sovereign immunity.

2

construe waivers of sovereign immunity strictly comes

3

into play when we construe the terms of the Tucker Act

4

itself.

5

apply that canon, you wouldn't read the Tucker Act to

6

encompass fully any act of Congress, because the

7

implications for waivers of sovereign immunity would be

8

quite substantial.

9

And so the canon that we

And I think it stands to reason that when you

And so the Court has never construed the

10

Tucker Act that way, and it shouldn't countenance that

11

kind of construction now, which is effectively what the

12

Federal Circuit's interpretation allows, because, rather

13

than applying the strict standard under which Congress

14

would have to be seen to have unequivocally expressed an

15

intent to waive the Government's sovereign immunity in

16

the terms of FCRA, it allows a plaintiff to avoid that

17

by simply resorting to the Tucker Act in the

18

jurisdictional basis of a complaint, and getting the

19

real act by the Federal Circuit's own description

20

standard that applies to the Tucker Act.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The United States -- the

22

United States is governed by the substance of the Credit

23

Reporting Act.

24

your point is there's no sanction for

25

noncompliance, even though the United States, a

The Act applies to the Government, but

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Government system, is supposed to conform to the

2

standards in the Act.

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I guess a few

4

responses, Justice Ginsburg.

5

whether the United States is subject to the substantive

6

obligations in FCRA, I don't know that's there's a one

7

size fits all answer.

8

provision by provision and make an assessment.

9

First, on the question of

I think you'd have to go

And the reason I would say that is that,

10

with respect to certain provisions at least, there are

11

other statutes that, depending on the provision, have a

12

specific obligation against the Government.

13

thinking in particular of the Debt Collection

14

Improvements Act, the Privacy Act in certain contexts.

15

And so you have -- you have to ask the question whether,

16

with respect to the particular FCRA provision that's

17

alleged to run against the United States, would the

18

better basis for finding the United States' obligations

19

be some other statute that speaks more specifically to

20

the question.

And I'm

21

So I'm resisting the notion that the -- the

22

FCRA's references to "person" in all of its substantive

23

obligations would necessarily encompass the Government.

24

Now, there's at least one provision as to which we don't

25

deny that the Government is covered, and that's
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1681(b)(b)(b), and that provision is set forth at pages --

2

at page 7a of the appendix to the Government's brief.

3

And with respect to the particular provision

4

at issue in this case, the truncation provision, I guess

5

we don't have to confront the question of whether the

6

Government is bound by that provision.

7

be, but we don't have to confront that question, because

8

the Government acts as if it's in compliance with that

9

provision because it has to.

It might well

There's a series of network agreements that

10
11

12

companies that allow the Government to participate in

13

the credit card system.

15

As a condition --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

1681b(b)(b),

Where is that case?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

1681(b)(b).

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You said 7a.

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I'm sorry.

17

If you look

at --

It starts

20

at 4a.

And the -- 4a, permissible purposes of

21

Government reports; the conditions for furnishing.

22

then if you go to 7a -- that's also part of (b)(b) --

23

b(b)4 has an exception for national security

24

investigations.

25

the case of an agency or department of the United States

And

And it talks at (b)(b)(4)(A) about "in

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Government which seeks to obtain and use."

And because

2

there's a reference to the United States Government in

3

that provision --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- it stands to reason that

6

the term "person" in (b)(b) -- which starts at 4a;

7

excuse me -- encompasses the United States Government.

8
9

I guess the short answer, Justice Ginsburg,
is I don't think that there is a one size fits all

10

answer.

11

taking the position that even if substantive obligations

12

run against the United States, there still wouldn't be a

13

remedy, at least a remedy in damages against the United

14

States?

15

But the other part of your question is, are we

And the answer to that is yes.
But that's not at all atypical under this

16

Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, and it's not

17

at all atypical for Congress to have fashioned a scheme

18

that runs in that way.

19

one example, where in the Privacy Act, which applies to

20

the Government and the Government alone, there are

21

certain obligations that the Government has to comply

22

with in that statute.

23

And the Privacy Act at least is

But Congress is very careful to cabin the

24

circumstances in which the Government would be subject

25

to liability and money damages.
15

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Still in all, your argument

2

is -- is not just a straightforward specific governs the

3

general argument.

4

if the other statute which the plaintiff is trying to

5

run around through the Tucker Act specifically -- it

6

clearly prohibits suit against the Government.

7

would say, you know, the specific governs the general

8

even though the govern -- the Tucker Act permits it; this

9

statute prohibits it.

I mean, that would be the case if --

Then you

But you're saying this other statute here

10
11

does not really prohibit it.

12

other statute does not permit it under our usual rules

13

about waiver of sovereign immunity being strictly

14

construed.

15

difference -- it's an odd sort of a specific governs the

16

general argument.

17

You're just saying this

So, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think, with respect,

18

Justice Scalia, I think that's a distinction that

19

ultimately doesn't make a difference in the context of

20

this case.

21

applied the specific over the general canon in related

22

contexts, it's true that the statutes in some situations

23

contemplated liability against the United States, but it

24

had -- that statute would have certain limitations.

25

In the prior cases in which this Court has

And I'm thinking, for example, of Hinck, of
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Erika, of Brown v. General Services Administration,

2

cases like that, and Sheehan.

3

was, where a statute provides for liability against the

4

United States, but in certain situations, you don't look

5

to a different statute, the Tucker Act, to circumvent

6

those kinds of limitations.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what the Court said

No, but that's -- that's

8

because the negative implication of that statute is --

9

affirms that there is no liability of the United States.

10

Okay?

11

negative implication at all, do you?

12

But here, you don't have -- you don't have that

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I guess -- I don't

13

think we need to have that negative implication to that

14

full extent in order to invoke the specific versus the

15

general canon, because the question at the end of the

16

day is what did Congress intend?

17

enacts a specific remedial scheme that sets out the

18

extent to which liability will be imposed under, in this

19

case, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it stands to reason

20

that Congress would have expected courts to look to the

21

remedial scheme that it established to determine to

22

metes and bounds of liability, not to some other general

23

default provision.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And where Congress

Mr. Srinivasan -And therefore in that

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sense, the specific remedial scheme that's in the

2

statute should control over some other general scheme

3

that Congress might well not have had in mind at all

4

when it set forward the terms under which claims can be

5

brought under FCRA.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How specific does the other

7

statute have to be?

Suppose there were another statute

8

that just said any party can bring suits to enforce any

9

rights against any persons under this statute.

10

Would you be making the same argument?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

12

If -- if the statute were

that general?

13

Yes.

If that's all the

statute says.

scheme.

Would you still say that -- this controls over

I think I would, because I

20

think in that context, Congress would have made a

21

determination on the scope of liability for claims under

22

that statute.

23

issue, and it would have set forth in a very general

24

provision the metes and bounds of the liability.

25

Congress I think in that context wouldn't have expected

It would have given thought to that

And

1

anyone to look to the Tucker Act, because Congress gave

2

no indication that it was thinking about the Tucker Act.

3

Now, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if you

4

had a statute that spoke in those kinds of general

5

terms, of course, we'd have I think a very good argument

6

that there would have been no contemplation of a waiver

7

of sovereign immunity.

8

notion that the United States might fall within the

9

compass of that general provision.

So we would strongly resist the

But on the question of whether you'd look to

10
11

that general provision as opposed to the Tucker Act, I

12

think you would look to that general provision, because

13

Congress in the context of enacting that statute told

14

everybody:

15

can be asserted in court by reference to this general

16

provision; this is where you ought to look, not

17

somewhere else.

We're defining the extent to which liability

Now, one other --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't it really -- doesn't

20

the question come down to as you're putting it

21

whether -- whether the Tucker Act eliminates for all

22

other statutes the presumption against liability on the

23

part of the United States?

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then it's

really the specific governing the general, but the other

5

way around, right?

6

specifically the liability and the sovereign immunity of

7

the United States, and if the statute just generally

8

doesn't address it, then the Tucker Act is the specific

one and the other statute is the general one.

10

The Tucker Act discusses

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it would be hard to

11

square that understanding with the way -- with the

12

series of this Court's cases that apply the specific

13

versus general canon, because I think the same argument

14

could have been made in Brown v. General Services

15

that the subject --

You'd win under this

argument, too, right?

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I'm sorry?

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You win under this

21

argument, too.

It just seems to me that it's not quite

22

right to say that FCRA -- FCRA does not specifically

23

address the liability of the United States.

24

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Tucker Act does.

So the Tucker Act is the one that's specific, and it

applies instead of the general language in the -- in

it that way, Mr. Chief Justice, but I guess my only

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, that's the question

because it depends on --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes – you better resist it.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- it depends on how you

13

construe the Tucker Act.

14

I mean, I think Your Honor is correctly

15

construing the Tucker Act's waiver of sovereign immunity

16

only to apply to a certain limited subset of acts of

17

Congress.

18

limited way, I suppose we could live with that result.

19

But I think the better way to approach the

And if you construed it in a sufficiently

20

question is to look at the particular remedial scheme

21

that Congress enacted in the scope of the statute

itself.

23

immunity, you'd look to that particular remedial scheme

24

and ask the age-old question, countenanced by this

And for purposes of questions of sovereign

Court's decisions, of whether there is an unequivocal --

2

unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign

immunity in the scope of that statute itself.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what is covered by the

5

Tucker Act?

I mean, every -- every basis for suit

6

against the Government, every claim that the Government

7

owes you money rests upon some statutory text, doesn't

8

it?

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There -- well --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what --

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- not claims in contract,

12

for example.

14

comes under a statute, necessarily, but -JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

That doesn't come under a statute, it comes

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

But anything that

21

comes under a statute, you would look to the other

22

statute to see whether there is sovereign immunity under

23

that statute; and, if there is under that statute, then

24

the Tucker Act does not overcome it.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

If that statute -- at least

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if that statute has its own remedial scheme, then you'd

2

look to the remedial scheme in that statute.

But I think this is where I started off with
Justice Sotomayor.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

anything left to the Tucker Act?

That's what I started with:

MR. SRINIVASAN:
is.

That's exactly what I

Right.

Is there

And I think there

I think the -- statutes like the one that this

10

Court had before it in White Mountain Apache Tribe are

11

ones.

12

Another example that I could give the Court

13

is there is a statute that dealt with payment of

14

compensation to prisoners of war.

15

that was at issue in Bell v. The United States.

16

it's cited in footnote 42 of the Court's opinion in

17

Bowen v. Massachusetts.

This was the statute

But that statute specifically set forth that

19

compensation would be owed to prison -- prisoners of war

22

the United States, and the United States alone, by

nature.

24
25

That statute did not have its own
Its substantive obligation ran against

And the Tucker Act, I think, in that context
would step in to supply a waiver of sovereign immunity

1

and jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims.

2

the reason is that that statute has the two predicate

3

conditions that we think have to be met in order to even

4

raise the question whether the Tucker Act steps in.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

So the new rule is if a

6

statute is written to impose obligations only on the

7

Government, then the Tucker Act is implicated

9

If the rule says the Government and any

10

must do X, Y, and Z, and the Government and the Medicaid

11

provider have the burdens of accomplishing Y, unless

12

there is an express waiver of sovereign immunity, the

13

Tucker Act doesn't come into play.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think that's --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's your position.

I think that's right, Your

17

Honor, but I'd qualify it in one respect, which is that

18

if -- if the statute contains its own remedial scheme,

19

that's an independent reason for not looking at the

20

Tucker Act.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you are not going

22

to suggest that if the scheme I just described says X,

23

Y, and Z, have to do all these things, and someone to

24

whom they owe that obligation can sue the Medicaid

25

provider, for example, for breach of that obligation,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

presumably -- I'm putting in a lot of hypotheticals

2

given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue

3

the Government under the Tucker Act --

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Right.
-- unless there is an

express waiver.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

I think you

8

would look to the question of whether there’s been a

9

sufficiently expressed waiver in the terms of the

10

statute itself, which is the traditional test that this

11

Court has applied.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about if a statute has

13

no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of

14

legal obligations, but it’s a generally applicable

15

statute, it doesn't concern only the United States?

16

Would your argument still apply that the Tucker Act has

17

no force?

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes, it would.

I think

19

it's easier where you have a remedial scheme, obviously,

20

but I think it's also the case that where the

21

substantive obligation is a generally applicable one and

22

doesn't run against the United States alone, you'd

23

still, I think, want to --

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

So then your argument really

isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In the briefs, you present it as another statute has a

2

remedial scheme, of course you should look to that more

3

particular remedial scheme.

4

argument and say, even if the other statute doesn't have

5

a remedial scheme, we don't look to the Tucker Act; we

6

just think of the Tucker Act as having a limitation that

7

is not in the Tucker Act's test -- text in order to make

8

the Tucker Act consistent with everything we thought we

9

knew about principles of sovereign immunity?

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But you would take the

That's true.

I mean, but I

11

guess -- you don't have to reach the question of whether

12

the Tucker Act applies or the statute doesn't have its

13

own remedial scheme, obviously, in this case, because

14

FCRA does have its own remedial scheme.

15

would still apply.

16

Our argument

And on the question of whether we're reading

17

the Tucker Act in one particular way to a subsets of

18

acts of Congress, I guess one point I'd make is that the

19

money mandating test that this Court has always applied

20

where the Tucker Act does apply already presupposes that

21

it doesn't apply to just any act of Congress, because

22

the act of Congress has to be a money-mandating one.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Say it again.

I lost it.

Give me the last sentence again.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

The last sentence, the last

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thought at least -- maybe I should try to rephrase it,

2

but the last thought is that this Court's jurisprudence

3

already presupposes that the Tucker Act doesn't apply to

4

every act of Congress because the Court's jurisprudence

5

requires that the act of Congress be money-mandated.

6

So we’re already in a zone in which the

7

Tucker Act's reference to acts of Congress doesn't

8

literally extend to every conceivable act of Congress.

9

It only extends to certain acts of Congress.

10
11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I --

But is this a

money-mandated statute?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

I -- if you didn't

13

have -- that's -- that's -- I guess -- if you didn't

14

have the remedial scheme.

15

We don't get to that question,

16

Justice Kennedy, because you only get to the

17

money-mandating question if there is not a remedial

18

scheme in the text of the statute itself and the

19

substantive obligation runs against the United States,

20

and the United States alone, which this one doesn't

21

because it's generally applicable.

22

And it's hard to conceive of that question

23

in the abstract because the question is whether the

24

statute is money-mandating in that it specifically

25

contemplates the payment of money by the United States;
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and, precisely because the statute is generally

2

applicable, I think we would say that under this statute

3

it's not money-mandating, because it's not

4

money-mandating in that it doesn't contemplate payment

5

by the United States with relevant specificity because

6

the substantive obligation is generally applicable.

7

You only get to that question in a context

8

like White Mountain Apache Tribe or Mitchell II, where

9

the substantive obligation runs against the United

10

States, and the United States alone, and where there’s

11

no remedial scheme embedded within the statute itself.

12

And then you ask the question whether is that kind of

13

substantive obligation that runs against the United

14

States, is that one that's naturally conceived as a

15

money-mandating.

16

And on that, I think you would look at a

17

couple of considerations consistent with this Court's

18

decisions.

19

necessarily deals with compensation?

20

the statute I was referring to earlier that has to do

21

with compensation for -- for imprisoned prisoners of

22

war, that one naturally has to do with compensation, so

23

it might be money-mandating.

24
25

One is, is the obligation one that
So, for example,

In White Mountain Apache Tribe and the other
trust cases that arise under the Indian Tucker Act, the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court concluded that because background principles of

2

trust law would necessarily contemplate the payment of

3

money, that those statutes are money-mandating.

4

But the principal point here --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

begs the question --

7
8

Counsel, this sort of

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- is you only get to that

question if you get past that hurdle.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the statute awards

10

damages for breach of the obligation, so it's

11

money-mandating.

12

money-mandating; the question is who’s it mandating.

The issue is not whether it's

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, right, but --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there is not an

15

issue of whether it contemplates the payment of damages.

16

It expressly awards --

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But I think the

18

money-mandating test, Justice Sotomayor, is whether it

19

contemplates the payment of damages by the

20

United States.

21

time addressing that question in the abstract, because

22

there’s a predicate condition that hasn't been

23

satisfied.

24
25

And I guess that's why I'm having a hard

That question only naturally arises where
the substantive obligation runs against the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States and the United States alone.

2

precisely for the reason that Your Honor says, where the

3

substantive obligation is generally applicable in that

4

it applies to parties beyond the United States, it's

5

hard to ask the question whether the statute is

6

money-mandating in the relevant sense.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think

I -- it is -- there is

8

some difficulty with your argument, which is, going back

9

to my simplified hypothetical, Government and

10

Medicaid -- X providers have to do X, Y, and Z; if those

11

persons, being defined as Government and providers,

12

doesn't do what they have to do, they have to pay these

13

damages.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

That -- I will grant -I mean, that's pretty

clear.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I will grant you,

18

Justice Sotomayor, that that hypo is more difficult than

19

this case because, although I would construe that to be

20

generally applicable, it does talk about the Government.

21

It specifically references the Government, and I think,

22

by Your Honor's hypothetical, the United States alone.

23

It's not an undifferentiated reference to persons, which

24

is what you have in FCRA.

25

I still think I would call that generally

applicable such that the Tucker Act wouldn't come into

2

play, but I don't deny that it would be a closer case

3

than what you have here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. JACOBS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JACOBS:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

12

If I may, I should like to begin with

13

Justice Kennedy's question:

statute?

Is this a money-mandating

15

Section 1681(a) defines "persons" and it

16

defines "persons" as, inter alia, "any Government or

17

Government body or agency."

18

would be extraordinarily clear that the Government is

19

subject to this act and subject to money-mandating.

wouldn't need the Tucker Act now, would you?

We -Just sue under the statute.

We could.

We believe we should

be able to recover simply under FCRA itself, yes, Your
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Honor.

But if there were any question as to whether the

2

Government is in fact covered, that would seem to me to

3

be answered by 1681b(b)(4).

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So are you splitting your

5

claim?

I mean, if you have both a cause of action under

6

FCRA and under the Tucker Act, the one has to go to the

7

Federal Circuit and the other elsewhere, or the Court of

8

Claims and then the Federal Circuit?

9

MR. JACOBS:

What do you do?

Your Honor, that was -- that

10

was the subject of some debate in the court below.

11

took the appeal to the Federal Circuit because the claim

12

was based in whole or in part on the Tucker Act.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We

You also claimed under

FCRA, under the statute, right?

20

you wanted to appeal.

21

deal?

22

do you care which circuit you go to?

23

think -- well, why do you care?

24
25

I guess you lost because

And so -- so what is the big

Appeal to the Seventh Circuit.

MR. JACOBS:

Who cares.

Why

You said you

We don't particularly care,

Your Honor, but we believe that we are required by the
32
Alderson Reporting Company

statute to appeal to the Federal Circuit if the claim is

2

based in whole or in part on the Tucker Act.

3

4

Government could have stipulated, we agree it goes to

5

the Seventh Circuit, and nobody would have opposed you

6

on that.

Honor.

10

11

want you to go to the Seventh Circuit?

14

MR. JACOBS:

15

Okay.

Right.

I'm sorry.

Before

you get --

18

MR. JACOBS:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you -- their

20

argument is if you go to the Seventh Circuit, you don't

21

get any money, right?

22

from the United States, don't you have to go to the

23

Court of Claims in a case like this?

5

respect, Your Honor, I would submit that this is -- this

6

is not some reticulated, remedial scheme where you have

7

to file a claim and have a hearing and those kinds of

8

things where this Court has enforced that against

9

people.

And in that regard, there's

10

Here, it's just a typical statute that says

11

you have to do A, B, and C, and if you don't you can be

12

sued in Federal court.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you know any other

14

statutes offhand -- I can't think of any, but maybe you

15

know some -- in which you can get money out of the

16

United States but don't have to go through the Court of

17

Claims and the Federal circuit?

18

there?

19

question, it becomes less and less plausible that FCRA

20

was meant to allow suit against the Federal Government.

21
22

What other statutes are

And if there are none, the reason I ask the

MR. JACOBS:

The Privacy Act, Your Honor,

allows you to sue the Government in the district court.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. JACOBS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

For money damages.

I believe so, Your Honor.
Not in tort.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

This seems an

Official

1

awful lot like a tort, or tell me why it isn't.

2

what you are saying is there's a statute that says you

3

can't print more than the last five digits of a card or

4

the date, the expiration date, and they did both and you

5

want to say "or" means one or the other, it doesn't mean

6

and/or.

7

right?

That's what the case is about fundamentally,

8
9

MR. JACOBS:

The case is about printing the

expiration date, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

10

All right, got it.

Yes, can you do and/or or

11

or.

Now, if you print -- in your

12

view of it, they printed too much about a person's

13

credit card.

14

MR. JACOBS:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

It sounds like an -- sort

16

of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a

17

tort.

18

MR. JACOBS:

It is like it, but I believe

19

this Court's jurisprudence has been for a long while

20

now, at least since Jacobs and I would submit even

21

earlier, Dooley onward, that it doesn't make any

22

difference whether -- if you're suing under a statute of

23

the United States or a contract or anything else, if

24

there's any element of tort in it, it doesn't matter.

But your argument --

10

your answer is a little more complicated, because the

11

statute doesn't say tort claims, it says claims sounding

12

in tort, which means cases that aren't torts, but are

13

like torts.

14

15

something like that.

16

And it seems to me the case you -- you --

MR. JACOBS:

Your Honor, I believe, again,

17

that this Court has not interpreted the cases that way.

18

There is a debate as to whether a breach of fiduciary

19

I'm sorry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- whether you think

7

Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United

8

States, given the multitude of financial transactions in

9

10

would be waived?

I mean, if you're right about this,

11

the consequences are enormous for the Federal fisc.

12

we -- the -- the statute developed in a peculiar way.

13

First, there was the definition of person

And

14

when there was no civil liability, and then some years

15

later the prohibition of having both the credit card

17

any hint that Congress envisioned a waiver of sovereign

18

immunity in the Fair Credit Reporting Act?

MR. JACOBS:

In all of it, is there

Your Honor, I would submit yes,

20

21

explicit reference in the Congressional Record to

22

whether this was going to impact the Government or not.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Jacobs --

-- the next year.
-- the -- the import of the

24

Government's argument is that if your interpretation

25

governed, we would be facing, really, a quite massive
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

change in the law of sovereign immunity as we've known

2

it until this time.

3

So I will give you an -- Congress decides to

4

pass a statute, and the statute has a cause of action in

5

it.

6

say that the Government retains sovereign immunity?

7

everybody says, no, the rules are that if we say nothing

8

at all, the Government does retain sovereign immunity.

And the drafters say to each other, do we have to

9

And

Now, under your world, the next time

10

Congress passes such a statute and that question comes

11

up, you would say, oh, we have to say that the

12

Government waives -- retains its sovereign immunity,

13

because if we don't say that, somebody's going to bring

14

an action under the Tucker Act.
So for every statute, both the ones that

15
16

have been written under the old rules and the new ones

17

to come, we have completely flipped the presumption.

18

Now, Congress is going to have to say when it wants to

19

retain sovereign immunity, and if it doesn't -- if it

20

doesn't, the Tucker Act applies, and you get to be in

21

court.

22

MR. JACOBS:

With respect, Justice Kagan, I

23

don't think that's true at all.

They went out of their

24

way to define person to include the Government.

And

25

that's significant in this respect, Your Honor.

We cite

That's a -- that's a question

14

Government has waived its sovereign immunity, the

15

Government retains it?

16
17
18

Are we going to say, all you need to

And as to that, you're asking us to flip the
presumption from now on.
MR. JACOBS:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

19

I think they went out of their way to say this applies.

20

It's not some general statute that says if a credit card

21

is printed improperly.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When the definition of

23

persons was put into the statute, there was no civil

24

liability; isn't that right?

25

could not have been thinking about civil liability.

So they didn't -- they

1

MR. JACOBS:

Well, when they amended FCRA in

2

1996 to add the -- to change the word from credit

3

reporting agency to person, I would submit that had to

4

be a conscious step.

5

And proof of that is found, I think, in two

6

subsequent amendments.

One, the next year,

7

1681(b)(b)(4), saying, but this does not apply to the

8

Government if there is a national security issue.

9

then the Government pointed to 1681(u)(i), that talked

And

10

about if the FBI improperly disclosed information, what

11

liability it would have.

12

Now, in the appendix to the Government's

13

brief, it stops there.

14

for cert at page 78a, it also has 1681(u)(l) which says

15

any other provision of this section notwithstanding,

16

people are limited to this remedy against the

17

Government.

18

not other liability for Congress -- for the

19

United States?

Why would Congress say that if there were

So, I believe the -- Congress was about as

21

clear as it could be that it knew this applied to the

out, it did so, twice.

upon whether the United States is liable or not?

improperly disclosing it.

that if there weren't other provisions applicable.

23

24

Moore case, which we discussed many times in our brief,

25

a similarly, almost identical statute, the Equal Credit
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Opportunity Act.

2

The Truth in Lending Act, the equal

3

opportunity -- the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and FCRA

4

different parts of it.

6

Act had the same, almost the same definition with one

word different of importance.

11

United States, unlike the Truth in Lending Act which had

12

a specific provision exempting the United States.

13

14

different.

15

could use.

22

States no longer even attempts to argue that ECOA does

23

not provide for waiver of sovereign immunity.

24
25

And, indeed, it would be difficult to because

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if you are right

about that, I guess we could write a very narrow opinion
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

saying the Tucker Act applies where there is a cause of

2

action under the original statute anyway, in which case

3

we would not have made much new law, would we?

Well, I'm hoping we won't make

5

much new law, Your Honor --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. JACOBS:

Yes.

-- because I believe this is

consistent with this Court's longstanding jurisprudence.
And, indeed, the -- the cases where the

10

Court says, no, we're not going to let you bring this

11

under the Tucker Act, is where the party is trying to

12

escape, to get around a limitation in the substantive

13

act, where they're trying to avoid a statute of

14

limitations, avoid the requirement to file a -- a claim,

15

as in Elkhorn Mining, as -- to get around -- get away

16

from a court as in Hinck, where it says the tax court

will have jurisdiction of this.

standard is a court going to hold you to, to decide

refers, for the reasons I was discussing with Justice

12

Sotomayor earlier, I think you could see that statute as

13

incorporating the Tucker Act itself, but that would be

14

something that Congress did.

15
16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about (u)(l), that

your friend raised?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

(u)(i).

I think there's

18

several answers to (u)(i).

19

which way that cuts because the fact -- it may be

20

(u)(l), it may be (u)(i), but (u) -- I'm not sure which

21

way that cuts because, on one hand, the fact that

22

Congress specifically provided for the United States to

23

be liable in certain situations I think cuts in favor of

24

our understanding, not against it.

25

First of all, I'm not sure

But there's a more fundamental point about
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the argument that my friend makes on the other side,

2

which is that that statute was enacted, I think, before

3

the civil remedies provisions were expanded to encompass

4

all persons.

5

notwithstanding any other provision would have referred

6

to something that came along later.

7

So it's hard to conclude that that

Now, I have two points that I'd like to make

8

in rebuttal, one of which, there's been some questions

9

today about which is the specific statute and which is

10
11

the general statute.
Now, one, I think, clear indication that the

12

specific statute for present purposes should be FCRA is

13

to look at what the Plaintiffs allege.

14

The Plaintiffs are bringing a FCRA claim,

15

and there's no mistake about that, because the

16

Plaintiffs seek the FCRA advantage of statutory damages

17

of at least $100.

18

in the FCRA cause of action.

19

you should look at FCRA to determine whether the

20

Government is liable.

21

And so they're grounding their claim
And I think, therefore,

And you don't have a situation in which you

22

can mix and match under both; you should look to FCRA to

23

determine whether there's been a clear and express

24

waiver of sovereign immunity.

25

The other point I would like to discuss is
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

something that -- references something Justice Breyer

2

was adverting to earlier, which is even if there was

3

some universe in which you could contemplate a

4

hybridization where you apply the Tucker Act, even

5

though there's a cause of action already in the statute,

6

you wouldn't do so in the context of this case because

7

there are clear indications that Congress wouldn't have

8

contemplated a resort to the Tucker Act.

9

The Tucker Act doesn't apply to torts.

This

10

claim is a tort claim.

We know this because the Court

11

in Safeco a few terms ago -- this is at 551 U.S. 69 --

12

specifically referred to the Restatement of Torts as a

13

means of -- interpreting the term willfulness, which is

14

the linchpin for the claim here.

15

I see my time has expired.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

The case is submitted.

18

(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the

19
