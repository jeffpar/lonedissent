ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. HANSEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

One way to address the question presented by

These are genes that correlate with an increased

5

MR. HANSEN:

How

Well, in -- in essence, Your

6

Honor, everything starts with a natural product.

this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a

natural product is insufficient.

9

And

For example, this

The examples that you cite all involve

Do you dispute that

you can patent, however, a process for extracting

20

MR. HANSEN:

Of course.

I think that is

21

totally acceptable.

22

is, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is

23

not at issue in this case.

12

anybody who wants to use the product either have to get

13

a license for the process or find a different way of

14

extracting it?

I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this

15

MR. HANSEN:

Does

I think they have to find a

16

different way of extracting it, in the same way that

17

finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to

18

a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also

19

entitle you to a patent on the use of gold.

20

example, if you find a new way of using gold to make

11

because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug

12

is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of

13

the plant.

14

MR. HANSEN:

If there is no alteration, if

15

we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it

16

and it has some additional value, then I think it is not

17

patentable.

can't get a composition patent.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

From what you know and

16

from what the record shows, would the process of tagging

17

the isolated DNA be patentable?

18

we just don't know about that or is there a patent on

19

that?

20

MR. HANSEN:

The process of tagging,

The very patents in this case

21

include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it

22

can be used as a probe.

23

We are not asking the Court to strike down that.

25

We have not challenged that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under our -- our law, is a

2

MR. HANSEN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

9

MR. HANSEN:

10

Even if you were to rule for Petitioners, you would not

11

have to rule concerning the use of DNA as a probe or a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Hansen, could you tell

14

me what you think the incentives are for a company to do

15

what Myriad did?

16

work and takes a lot of investment to identify this

17

gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and

18

what you just said is that discovering uses for that

19

gene would not be patentable, even if those new -- even

20

if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this

21

deal?

22

like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going

23

to do this work anymore?

24
25

If you assume that it takes a lot of

Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies

MR. HANSEN:

Well, we know that would not

have happened in this particular case, Your Honor.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official

1

know that there were other labs looking for the BRCA

2

genes and they had announced that they would not patent

3

them if they were the first to find it.

4

that prior to the patent actually being issued, there

5

were other labs doing BRCA testing and Myriad shut all

6

that testing down.

7

that problem would not have arisen.

8
9

We also know

So we know in this particular case

But the point of the whole -- the whole
point of the product of nature doctrine is that when you

10

lock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from

11

innovating and -- and making new discoveries.

12

that's the reason we have the product of nature

13

doctrine, is because there may be a million things you

14

can do with the BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is

15

allowed to look at it and that is impeding science

16

rather than advancing science.

of the investment in Myriad's work, but -JUSTICE SCALIA:

the question.
MR. HANSEN:

But -- yeah.

scientists look for things for a whole variety of
12

reasons, sometimes because they're curious about the

Curiosity is your answer.

Sometimes because they want a

Sometimes --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I thought you were going to

say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped

10

you were going to say something else, which is that,

11

notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this

12

gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various

13

things that you could get a patent on that would make

14

this kind of investment worthwhile, in the usual case.

15

But if that's the case, I want to know what those things

16

are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're

17

supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel

18

Prizes.

19

And I agree that there are those scientists,

20

but there are also, you know, companies that do

21

investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't

22

just shut them down.

23

MR. HANSEN:

Let me give a specific example

24

that may be helpful in doing a better job of answering

25

the question.

One of the -- one of the amici has
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

worried a lot about whether a decision for the

2

Petitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant

3

DNA.

4

innovations in industry are doing these days.

5

DNA where the scientist decides the sequence rather than

6

nature deciding the sequence.

7

Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major
It's

There is nothing in our position that would

8

prevent recombinant DNA from being patented, but there

9

is -- it is the cases that if the patents are upheld,

10

recombinant DNA is frustrated.

11

People can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to

12

recombine them and find new treatments and find new

13

diagnoses and find new things that will advance medicine

14

and science as a result of these patents.

15

perfect example of what the point of the product of

16

nature doctrine is.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

It's a

But, of course, to

18

profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to

19

not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do

20

something with it afterwards.

21

given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the

22

gene.

23

MR. HANSEN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

So you really haven't

Well -I mean, sure, yes, I can do

stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else.
14

What advantage do I get from being the person that or

2

the company that isolated that -- that gene.

3

none at all.

5

MR. HANSEN:

No, I think you get enormous

recognition, but I don't think --

6

MR. HANSEN:

8

that's sufficient.

9

to these two genes.

10

You say

Well, that's lovely.

But I think that we know that

We know it's sufficient with respect
We also know it's sufficient with

respect to the human genome project.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure the

12

Court can decide the case on -- on that basis.

13

that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief

14

that this investment is necessary and that -- and that

15

makes sense.

16

it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer.

17

I'm sure

To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do

As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions

18

indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are

19

process patents that they can have, that this is

20

sufficient.

21

MR. HANSEN:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's certainly true.
But I -- I just don't

23

think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't

24

worry about investment, it'll come.

25

think we can do that.

I -- I just don't

It may be that the law allows you
15

Alderson Reporting Company

1

to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature

2

and there's nothing new here, but that's quite

3

different.

4

MR. HANSEN:

And it is certainly true, as

5

Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is

6

a process patent or a development patent.

7

you've isolated the gene and you find a new use for it,

8

you could get a patent on the new use for the patent.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the whole point,

10

isn't it?

11

the use you put the isolation to.

12

isn't it?

The isolation itself is not valuable, it's

That's the answer,

That's exactly correct.

answer, which is in isolation it has no value.

MR. HANSEN:

3

and -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene

4

and the gene in the body are the same.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can we go to -- can we

go to cDNA a moment?

7

MR. HANSEN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.
That is artificially

9

created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature.

10

It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in

11

nature.

12

introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and

13

they're sequenced together.

14

that.

2

3

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know, but I don't see the

5

answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it

6

correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA

7

does not have the same base pairs.

8

something instead of an A or whatever it is.

9

MR. HANSEN:

10

There's a U or

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So when you actually look,

11

if you could get a super-microscope and look at what

12

they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would

discover something with an A, not a U.

14

that the one?

15

1

cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that

2

doesn't correspond to anything in your body.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mister -- General

4

Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief

5

that your view was that, although the cDNA may be

6

patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's true now, Justice

8

Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that

9

the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not

10

have been true at the time the patents were initially

11

issued.

And --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand -But I -- I thought

14

the basic general approach here was we have a very

15

expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we

16

narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness

and so on.

address the questions at issue here in the obviousness

realm?

Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to

GENERAL VERRILLI:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a little -If you got something

22

25

That the idea -- a smaller

Alderson Reporting Company

2

something bigger isn't obvious.

3

understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at

4

that stage.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And if it is, I don't

Well, I think my answer

6

to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first

7

to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the

8

threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility

9

does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty

10

test and a specification test do not do, and the work

11

that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to

12

ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature

13

itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly

14

because if it can be deemed to be a human invention

15

solely as a result of the change that occurs when you

16

extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a

17

practical matter that you have granted a patent on the

18

gene itself because no one else can extract it because

19

extracting it is isolating it, isolating it violates the

20

patent.

21

And so as a result of that, no one else can

22

try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one

23

else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
that's responsive to my concern.

I'm -- I'm not sure

Your answer said well,

27
Alderson Reporting Company

here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent

2

protection.

3

focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at

4

the obviousness stage.

5

My question goes to whether we ought to

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, the Court

6

identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo

7

that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that

8

question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the

9

eligibility stage because the -- because getting the

10

balance right is of critical importance.

there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not

3

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Why -- why should we jump

Well, I would -- again, I

5

would point the Court to what the Court said last term

6

in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent

7

eligibility really is a double-edged sword.

8

And it may be that in a -- in a particular

9

case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a

10

view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the

11

other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and

12

the proposition of whether you can patent the gene

13

itself is a question we think of fundamental importance,

14

and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that

15

led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo.

16

was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.

In many other

different from nation to nation.

illustrate the point.

but only for a particular use.

7

8

So you would get what is

9

If you -- just as with the question that

10

Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a

11

useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you

12

isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects,

13

you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you

14

can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that

15

no one else can explore it for different uses and for --

16

and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to

17

recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more

18

therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance.

19

that's --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

I understand why you are

21

saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter.

23

says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides

situation.

7

The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual

matter cDNA is patent eligible.

I think that's a fight between the parties.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you are not taking

the position that this claim as written is patentable?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's right, Your Honor.

12

We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think

13

cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial

14

creation, it's as a general matter patent eligible.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's true, but then

3

you were saying something that I just didn't understand

4

because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed

5

briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the

6

chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and

7

it's attached to two ends.

8
9

But also in the body, perhaps because cells
die, there is isolated DNA.

And that means that the DNA

10

strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies,

11

and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very

12

few of them in the world, but there are some, by the

13

laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely

14

the BRCA1 gene.

us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?

that -JUSTICE BREYER:

snipping.

You've got the thing there and you snip --

MR. CASTANIAS:

You

Well, I -- I guess I'll even

23

take issue with that because the -- the story of how the

24

SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about is

25

exactly the opposite of that.

If you look, for example,

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the

2

declaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shattuck, at

3

paragraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the

4

Myriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree

5

at least on that score with the Solicitor General, is

6

indeed eligible for patenting.

7

way, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different

8

patient samples to create what was called a consensus

9

sequence.

10
11

But then -- and by the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You've got

the cDNA.

12

MR. CASTANIAS:

And then what the -- what

13

the Myriad inventors then did to create what is called

14

SEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the

15

'282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that

16

further to add in the introns.

17

the inventive process was additive.

18

It was in -- actually,

Now, ultimately, again, going back to the

19

last sentence of section 103, the patentability should

20

not be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an

21

invention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter.

is a --

product of human ingenuity and that has substantial new

12

uses.

Now, my friends on the other side have said --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Castanias, go back to

14

Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right because it

15

takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually

16

find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a

lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on

the genetic material.

But are you -- are you saying that you could

20

patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a

21

lot of ingenuity to find it?

22

MR. CASTANIAS:

The plant itself, I think

23

not, Justice Kagan, but I think the question that was --

isolate it.

You've now taken it out of the Amazon forest.

Can you now patent the thing itself?

MR. CASTANIAS:

Can you

Well, what I -- what I

20

haven't done is isolated a new thing.

All I have done

21

is isolate the plant from the forest.

And that's the

22

distinction I think I'm trying to get across to the

23

Court, not particularly well at least in my colloquy

24

with Justice Breyer, but I'll try again.

25

that what -- what was, quote, merely snipped out of the

reason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used

in the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian

cancers.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The most important

forest can't be used for any purpose either.

has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's

uprooted and taken out of the forest.

But it's still

10

the same thing.

11

to understand is how this is different than that.

12

still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it,

13

it in fact has lots of great uses.

14
15

And I guess what you haven't gotten me

MR. CASTANIAS:

It's

Well, I think there are two

ways -- two ways to look at that.

16

First of all, if you want to look at it from

17

the -- the perspective of the so-called product of

18

nature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous

19

consequences if it's not cabined and understood

20

correctly.

21

product of nature doctrine, you could say, well, that's

22

the same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative

23

history of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are

24

unmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for

25

patents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and

But if you look at it strictly from a

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

genetics and that sort of thing.
But the product of nature doctrine is

3

troublesome for this reason, modern medicine -- go

4

beyond just the isolated DNA patents here.

5

medicine, particularly the area of personalized

6

medicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are

7

administering to individual patients is giving them the

8

opportunity to mimic the actions of the body.

9

actually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to

Modern

And -- so

10

nature, rather than farther away.

11

takes the product of nature doctrine beyond the simple

12

truism that the product of nature is something that is

13

not a human invention, then that's very dangerous, not

14

just for our case --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And anything that

But when you -- when you

16

isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as

17

a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals

18

that make it probe.

19
20
21

MR. CASTANIAS:

As a probe, that's true.

As

a primer, that wouldn't be required.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it seemed to me your --

22

your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well,

23

it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer.

24

Neither can the isolate without some additions.

25

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, since this Court --

the process or the additions that make it patentable,

patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point

6

of Justice Kagan's question.

concede at least that the decision in the Federal Circuit,

the Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too?

That is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments

16

did not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that

17

wrong.

MR. CASTANIAS:

No, what -- I think

there is nothing in this record that says that isolated

DNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body.

you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the

of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself

Well -And I would like you to

6

express your view on that because that's the framework

7

that I am bringing to the case.

8
9

MR. CASTANIAS:

I -- I will offer the view,

Justice Breyer.

10

First of all, in this Court's decision in

11

Brenner v. Manson, followed repeatedly by the Federal

12

Circuit, it has been hornbook patent law, to use your

13

term, that you do not need to -- to call out the utility

14

of an invention in a particular claim.

15

to do is have utility for the invention itself described

16

in the specification.

17

What you do have

And that's what the Patent Office looked to

18

in its Utility Guidelines in 2001.

19

neither -- I think this case is very -- very easily

20

decided on a straightforward ground that does not

21

require the Court to go making fine distinctions between

22

cDNA and DNA.

23

And that ground is this:

the executive's position in this Court and in the

6

chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that?

7

through the Section 101 gate.

8

through the Section 102 gate or the 103 gate, I don't

9

have any opinion on.

Whether it would pass

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Would -- would -- okay.

11

MR. CASTANIAS:

And then there's the

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's interesting --

14

MR. CASTANIAS:

Sure.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- because then it's not a

12

further --

16

question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds

17

or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about.

18

Right?

So you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not

19

the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you

20

know, we could just go up from there and talk about all

21

kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we?

22

we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?

23

MR. CASTANIAS:

Couldn't

I -- I think -- I think,

24

Justice Kagan, you're really putting your finger on the

25

problem with this, again, I -- I keep wanting to refer
54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

to as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I

2

don't believe that as a separate doctrine it really

3

exists.

4

something that shows a lack of invention.

It's just the flip side of the coin of

5

And, of course, that's where Section 103

comes into full force as the Chief Justice mentioned

7

earlier in the argument.

8

comparisons to what was old and what was new.

think the organ, the liver, gets past 103 in that

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are saying it gets past

101.

I don't

circumstance even if you say, well --

11
12

Section 103 allows you to make

MR. CASTANIAS:

Even if it gets through the

101 --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's -- that's the

16

problem.

17

from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?

I mean, all parts of the human body?

18

MR. CASTANIAS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Anything

No.
And it gets through 101?

20

Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's

21

bothering me.

22

MR. CASTANIAS:

Okay.

So let -- let me try

23

to help you with that.

24

distinction is between the liver or the kidney, which

25

was the one brought up in the federal circuit opinion,

Because -- because the

55
Alderson Reporting Company

1

but liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your

2

organ.

3

when it's inside the body and it's out.

4

our --

But it's the same thing.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is the same thing
That's where

But you're not

6

suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a

7

piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece

8

patentable.

9
10

MR. CASTANIAS:

No.

Absolutely not.

It's

the same thing.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's the

12

difference?

13

in the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not

14

patentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece,

15

that is?

16

I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole

What's the difference between the two -MR. CASTANIAS:

I would say that -- I would

17

say that under -- under your existing decisions in

18

Chakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad

19

understanding of Section 101 and an understanding of

20

what is within the limited exception, then what -- I --

21

I would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103

22

does this work better than Section 101, but to the point

23

of Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different

24

about that piece in the body.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah.

Then -- then watch

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what you're doing.

2

Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything

3

under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've

4

rejected more often than we've followed it.

5

That's very, very interesting.

And particularly with a thing found in

6

nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just --

7

human kidneys and so forth.

8

something else.

9

so everything will involve your vast taking something

Everything is inside

Plants, rocks, whatever you want.

And

10

out of some other thing where it is, if only the

11

environment.

12

some other test than just that it was found within some

13

other thing.

14

And it's at that point that I look for

MR. CASTANIAS:

And I think, Justice Breyer,

15

there is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you

16

about the different functions, the different values.

17

you think about patents as economic instruments, the

18

different economic values that come out of this, the

19

different things that patients now have as a result of

20

this human ingenuity, they didn't have the BRCA1

21

isolated gene before the Myriad invention.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we could have said

If

23

that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the

24

choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the

25

patent was that we have a uniform rule for all
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

industries.

2

MR. CASTANIAS:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right, but in -And -- and that avoids

4

giving special industries special subsidies, which is

5

very important it seems to me.

6

Let me ask you this, and it's consistent

7

with my -- my preface.

8

government's position that the DNA is not patentable but

9

the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient

If we were to accept the

10

protection for innovation and research?

11

not?

12

MR. CASTANIAS:

And if not, why

The -- the problem of making

13

that decision now is that so much has happened since

14

these gene patents issued and since the Utility

15

Guidelines.

16

will hurt the industry as a general matter to not have

17

isolated gene but only have cDNA patents.

18

I can't tell you for a certainty whether it

But here's what I think it will hurt, and I

19

think it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this

20

Court comes out of this case with.

21

will then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is

22

to draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between,

23

well, how much more manipulation.

Because what you

24

My friend on the other side used the term,

25

in response to Justice Ginsburg, "further manipulation
58
Alderson Reporting Company

is required to take it out of the product of nature."

2

He -- he said no alteration, to Justice Alito, would

3

make it a product of nature.

4

this case that there has been some alteration of the

5

isolated DNA molecules.

6

But there's no dispute in

And that brings me back to the Utility

7

Guidelines.

9

15

inventions.

16

That has not -- those -- that parade of

17

horribles has not happened.

18

hypothesize at this point because you've got all of

19

these years of experience between the time these patents

20

issued and the time that this -- this challenge

21

belatedly came along.

22

And you don't have to

Justice Breyer, a point about no

23

25

important point, but I think what you -- what is

is no risk of anything being preempted other than what

13

the claims properly claim, which are human-made

14

inventions of isolated molecules.

15

There

And I think one last point to close on.

16

It's important to note that molecules have been patented

17

for a very long time.

18

are often made by taking one molecule and another

19

molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a

20

test tube, which is a very common thing, its reactions

21

have been around 100 years just like snipping has been,

22

but they make something new and useful and life saving

23

from that.

24
25

That's what drugs are.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HANSEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

22

MR. HANSEN:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Is there some value to

24

us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA?

25

If we were to do what the government is proposing in
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case, what's the consequences?

2

MR. HANSEN:

Of -- of course there would be

3

value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it

4

reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more

5

importantly, the effect of the patents in this case

6

allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the

7

human body.

8

Myriad can -- has the authority given it by the

9

government to stop anyone from doing research on a piece

If you uphold the patents in this case,

10

of the human body.

11

if you were to -- to make it clear that was

12

impermissible.

13

That would be a significant advance,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, how do you

14

understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?

15

I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into

16

cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with

17

the description of that claim because it included 15

18

nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says

19

reoccur in nature.

20

MR. HANSEN:

Well, and yes, I -- I agree,

21

Your Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6,

22

which are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or

23

longer.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
harder.

Now, I'm making your job

How could they write it to do what he thinks
62

1

would be patentable?

2

MR. HANSEN:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, all -So assuming we believe

6

he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature

8

So make that assumption.

Make the

assumption that they can make a claim for it.

How do we

avoid his problem?

MR. HANSEN:

12

13

your adversary by answering this question.

14

But

MR. HANSEN:

Well -I know you are helping

That's fine, Your Honor.

I

15

think that the -- all of the claims in this case, all

16

nine claims that we are challenging include both

17

fragments and the whole gene.

18

anything you can do with respect to these nine claims.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. HANSEN:

So I don't think there is

I am putting that aside.

I think by saying that when

21

genes are transformed in such a way that the scientist

22

decides their sequence rather than the nature deciding

23

their sequence --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Only if they do a

recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.
63
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. HANSEN:

Right, right.

Now I don't

2

think cDNA is recombinant DNA, that's what we've argued,

3

but that's -- that's at least one plausible way of

4

looking at it.

5

The genes in this case, the patents on the

6

genes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman,

7

and child in the United States.

8

gives the -- the government has given Myriad the

9

authority to stop research on every one of our genes.

10

And as I just said, it

That simply can't be right.

11

And I would like to make one other point

12

13

Lander's brief he discusses specifically that the BRCA

14

genes appear in the body with covalent bonds in

15

fragments.

scientific dispute about that fact.

MR. HANSEN:

what I may have left a misimpression with Justice

23
