CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Garre, welcome

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Your Honor, and may

it please the Court:

9

The question in this case is when does a

10

trained drug detection dog's alert to a vehicle

11

establish probable cause to search the vehicle?

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you for or against the

dog this time?

14

MR. GARRE:

For it again, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. GARRE:

For it.

The Florida Supreme Court

17

answered that question by erecting what we think is an

18

extraordinary set of evidentiary requirements, in

19

effect, puts the dog on trial in any suppression hearing

20

in which defendant chooses to challenge the reliability

21

of the dog.

22

I think, most fundamentally, the problem

23

with the court of appeals' -- the Supreme Court's

24

decision -- is that it misconceives what this Court's

25

cases conceive of the probable cause requirement,
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

converting probable cause, which this Court has referred

2

to as a substantial chance, or fair probability, of the

3

detection of contraband or evidence of a crime, into

4

what amounts to a continuously updated batting average

5

and a requirement that dogs be virtually infallible.

6

That -- that --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Mr. Garre -That -- that goes to the

field performance; but, the other requirements, that

10

the -- some showing that the test -- that the training

11

program is reputable, some showing that the handler, not

12

only the dog, has -- has had training, it seems to me

13

those two -- not -- there's nothing improper about that.

14

MR. GARRE:

Well, and I think, Your Honor,

15

under our view of it, it's okay to inquire into whether

16

or not the dog has successfully completed a bona fide

17

training program, which -- which we think is a training

18

program in which the dog is going to be tested for

19

proficiency, including in a setting where some vehicles

20

have drugs and some vehicles don't.

21

And Aldo, the dog in this case, clearly was.

22

He'd received a 120-hour training program with the

23

police department in Apopka, Florida.

24

40-hour refresher seminar by another police department

25

in Dothan, Alabama.

He received a

And he was subjected to continuous
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

weekly training, in which part of that training

2

consisted of taking him out, walking him by some

3

vehicles that contained cars, some vehicles that didn't.

4

And the testimony of Officer Wheetley was

5

that Aldo's performance was really good.

6

meant by that was that if there were eight cars with

7

drugs.

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why didn't -- then why

didn't they get the dog recertified?

By the time of the

search, the certification had expired 16 months.

11
12

And what he

MR. GARRE:

It was a lapse, Your Honor.

The

dog subsequently was recertified.

13

Our position is that the Fourth Amendment

14

doesn't impose an annual certification requirement.

15

Some states have it, some states don't.

16

I think, more important in this case was the

17

fact that the dog was continuously trained, continuously

18

evaluated in training.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what do you -- what

20

do you have to show to establish that the dog was well

21

trained.

22

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

23

most important thing is successful completion of

24

proficiency testing.

25

I mean, what -- what our friends would like,
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and what the Florida Supreme Court would like, would

2

really for the courts to delve into all aspects of the

3

training, what types of distracters were used, what type

4

of smell and printing was used and the like.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if it were just

6

that -- you have the show that the program was

7

reputable.

8

MR. GARRE:

9

authentic, Your Honor.

Well, certainly that it was
And here, the programs were --

10

were conducted by actual police departments in -- in

11

Alabama and Florida.

12

presume regularity in those sorts of training settings.

13
14

And this Court ordinarily would

And there's no reason to approach the
training of a dog any differently, but -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

I thought all of these

16

training facilities were private entities that

17

contracted with police departments.

18

MR. GARRE:

No, Your Honor.

The

19

certification.

Certification usually is done by private

20

entities which are operated by former law enforcement

21

officers.

22

was done by police departments themselves.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the training itself, it usually and here

Could I go back to

24

Justice Ginsburg's question?

There's no -- what I

25

hear -- read the Florida court saying is there's no
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

national standard for certification.

2

MR. GARRE:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

That's correct?

Yes.
There's no national

standard that defines what's adequate training, correct.

5

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There --

So -- let me just finish

7

my question.

So assuming there's no national standards,

8

then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions

9

about the content of the certification process, the

10

content of the training process, and what the results

11

were and how they were measured, how do you expect a

12

judge to decide whether the certification and the

13

training are sufficiently adequate.

14

MR. GARRE:

And I think that the central

15

inquiry that we would think the judge would undertake is

16

to determine whether or not the dog was performing

17

successfully in proficiency testing.

18
19

I mean -- after all, that's why we train the
dogs.

And if -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

But you still have to

21

ask what that training was, and the judge still has to

22

determine whether the judge believes it was adequate,

23

correct?

24

requires.

25

That's what the totality of circumstances

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, in our view,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we don't think it's -- it's an appropriate role for the

2

Court to delve into the contours of the training, what

3

specific methods were used to train or distract or --

4

you know, all the contours that they bring up in their

5

brief.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what does a judge do,

7

just say, the police department says this is adequate,

8

so I have to accept it's adequate?

9

MR. GARRE:

Not -- you would have to accept

10

it, Your Honor, on its face.

11

like this -- and I think this record is clearly

12

sufficient -- and, ultimately, that's what we're asking

13

this Court to hold -- what you have in the record

14

is evidence --

15

I think you -- in a record

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Garre, I -- I have

16

no problem that this record -- with this record.

17

problem is how do we rule.

18

My

Because it seems the me that I'm not quite

19

understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're

20

asking us to announce.

21

saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a

22

police department's determination of what's adequate for

23

proficiency, that establishes probable cause.

24

what I think the rule you want us to -- to do.

25

I think the legal rule, you're

That's

I don't know what the role of the judge is
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in that --

2

MR. GARRE:

I think it would be close --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. GARRE:

-- with that rule.

-- close to that.

We would ask

5

whether or not the dog successfully treated -- completed

6

training by a bona fide organization.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And here --

No certification, no

8

questioning of the handler and the handler's training?

9

The judge can't do any of that and shouldn't do any of

10
11

that.
MR. GARRE:

Certification is not required.

12

It may be one way that the police department could

13

establish reliability a different way, but certification

14

itself is not required when you have a record of the

15

type of training that you have here.

16

We do think that you could put the handler

17

on the stand and ask about the reliability, certain

18

questions about reliability.

19

We don't think, in a record like this, the

20

judge would say, well, it says that he completed 120

21

hours in narcotics detection at the Apopka, Florida

22

police department, and 40 hours at the Dothan police

23

department, so --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's not enough for

you to win by us saying that a court can't insist on
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

performance in the field records, that it has to look at

2

the totality of the circumstances.

3

What other case have -- have we announced,

4

under a totality of the circumstance test, an absolute

5

flat rule like the one you're proposing?

6

have we said that one thing alone establishes probable

7

cause --

8

MR. GARRE:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

Where else

Your Honor --- that one factor

alone.
MR. GARRE:

-- I think one area where the

12

Court mentioned that was in the Lago Vista case, where

13

it talked about the importance of clear rules for police

14

officers and --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose that if the

16

reasonableness of a search depended upon some evidence

17

given by a medical doctor, the Court would not go back

18

and examine how well that doctor was trained at Harvard

19

Medical School and, you know, what classes he took and

20

so forth, right.

21

MR. GARRE:

Absolutely.

And the same way

22

that when an officer provides evidence for a search

23

warrant, we don't demand the training of the officer,

24

what schools he went to or what specific courses he had

25

in probable cause.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Garre, you said there

was the certification, training program, but you gave a

3

4

You said, or otherwise show proficiency in

5

So if there is no certification, no

6

training, how would the state establish that the dog was

7

reliable in detecting drugs?

8
9

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, I think that that

would be the unusual case, and it probably would be

10

captured by the other factors; but, what we meant by

11

including that is that there's no limit on the types of

12

evidence that the police could submit to show

13

reliability.

14

If you didn't have certification or a formal

15

training program, the fact that there was evidence that

16

a dog like Aldo successfully performed in weekly

17

training over the course of the year, and the police

18

submitted the records, like the records in the Joint

19

Appendix in this case at pages 106 and 116, that might

20

be another way of establishing reliability.

21

But the -- the central way would be showing

22

that the dog successfully completed training or that the

23

dog was certified.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think you'll agree

that the handler, too, the handler would have to -11

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, we don't think

2

there is a Fourth Amendment requirement of certification

3

for handlers.

4

among states.

5
6

Again, this is something that varies

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

but that the handler has been -- has been trained --

7

MR. GARRE:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Not -- not certification,

Yes.
-- to work with drug

detection dogs.
MR. GARRE:

10

That's correct.

And Officer

11

Wheetley here, of course, had been trained.

He had

12

gotten a 160-hour course in narcotics detection, and had

13

done training with Aldo in the Dothan, Alabama police

14

department, 40 hours there.
And these dog -- the dog, Aldo, and Officer

15
16

Wheetley had worked together for about a year before the

17

time of the search.

18

The handlers themselves are going to be in

19

the best position to know the dogs and evaluate their

20

reliability.

21

the dogs are reliable.

22

want to miss contraband when it's available -- when it

23

exists in the field; and, also, they don't want to be

is consistently putting the officer in a position of

4

searching cars based on an alert when that dog is not

5

reliable in predicting the presence --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I'm somewhat

7

troubled by all of the studies that have been presented

8

to the Court, particularly the Australian one where,

9

under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly

10

only 12 percent of the time.

11

How and when and who determines when a dog's

12

reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure

13

number?

14

is, and how does a judge determine that that's being

15

monitored?

16

And what is -- what do you suggest that number

MR. GARRE:

We don't think the

17

Fourth Amendment puts a number on it.

18

rejected a numerical conception of probable cause.

19

But with respect --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This Court has

Well, I'm deeply

21

troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the

22

time.

23

unfixed number, that seems like less than probability

24

for me.

25

Whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an

MR. GARRE:

But, but let me -- let me
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

address the, the South Wales study, Your Honor, which I

2

think is the one that you were referring to and that's

3

the primary one relied on by the other side.

4

case they reported that over the course of several years

5

the dogs' alerts resulted in discovery of drugs only 26

6

percent of the time.

7

In that

But there is another part of that study

8

which doesn't come up in the amicus briefs, and that's

9

that in 60 percent of the other cases the individuals

10

admitted to using drugs or being in the proximity of

11

drugs.

12

accurate alerts, as you should, then the number becomes

13

70 percent of dogs accurately alerting.

1

that successfully perform week in and week out in

2

training are going to successfully perform in the -- in

3

the real world.

4

And, after all, I think the most problematic

5

aspect of the challenges to the reliability of these

6

dogs is that law enforcement agencies across the country

7

at the state and Federal level, law enforcement agencies

8

around the world, and law enforcement agencies that

9

protect this Court rely on detection dogs as reliable

10

predictors of the evidence of contraband, evidence

11

of the presence of explosives or likewise.

12

And this is an area where we think that a

13

page of logic and experience is worth a volume -- a page

14

of experience and history is worth a volume of logic.

15

These dogs have been used and are being used in many

16

settings across the country and across the world today.

17

And the reason they are being used is because the people

18

who work with them know that they are reliable and --

19

and know by experience that they are reliable.
And that's one of the central problems we

20
21

have with the argument on the other side, is that

22

ultimately this Court should distrust the reliability of

23

the dogs.

24
25

And again -JUSTICE KAGAN:

understand your argument?

Well, Mr. Garre, could I
Because -- suppose in a case
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the government comes in, says this dog has been through

2

training and the handler has been through training.

3

this is a case in which -- this is never going to come

4

up when the dog actually alerts to narcotics; it's not

5

worth anybody's time at that point.

And

6

It's only going to come up in a case like

7

this, where a dog alerts to narcotics, there is no --

8

there are no narcotics, but something else is found, and

9

so the person ends up being criminally prosecuted.

10
11

So

it's, you know, a small universe of cases.
So the government comes in and says that the

12

dog has been trained.

13

at that point call the handler, say, how has the dog

14

been trained, what are the methods that -- that the dog

15

has -- was used, and how did the dog do in training?

16

Can the -- can the defendant do that.

MR. GARRE:

defendant can call the handler and can ask those sorts

19

of questions.

play-reward or the scent-imprinting method in training.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And how about if you really,

3

if there were some articles that said, you know, that

4

there was a certain kind of method that, for example,

5

led to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler.

6

Could the -- could the criminal defendant say, did you

7

use that method that leads to these problematic results?

8
9

MR. GARRE:
Honor.

I -- I don't think so, Your

First of all, cueing is not part of this case

10

11

argument is the dog was just sort of inherently

reliable.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

I'm using "cueing" not in

14

terms of any intentionality, but one thing that I

15

learned in reading all of this was that one difficulty

16

here is that dogs respond to subconscious cues and that

17

there are different ways of training that make that less

18

or more of a problem.

19

MR. GARRE:

And our position is, is that you

20

can inquire into cueing during this hearing, that the

21

defendants can -- can argue that the dog was cued, and

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I have two

7

separate questions for you.

Tying the earlier case a

8

little bit to this one, I am assuming that your position

9

is -- and you'll tell me what the legal standard is --

10

that a well-trained dog, if he alerts, or walks by a row

11

of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts to drugs,

12

that that simple alert is probable cause for the police

13

to get a search warrant.

14

MR. PALMORE:

Yes, we believe that an alert

15

by a trained dog is sufficient to establish probable

16

cause.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that, without any

18

other information about -- unlike the earlier case or

19

this one, where the police officer saw the individual

20

being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all

21

it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is

22

no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent

23

of the time?

24

conducted by the handler in which the dog, in a

those kinds of questions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the only

8

thing really you say they can't ask about is what's --

9

what's his record.
MR. PALMORE:

10

Well, there is a question --

11

there are a couple sub-issues here.

The principal vice

12

of the Florida Supreme Court was in imposing an

13

unprecedented and inflexible set of evidentiary

14

obligations that are part of the government's

15

affirmative case that the government has to always

16

introduce any time it seeks to establish probable cause

17

based on a dog alert.

18

misplaced for a -- for a variety of reasons.

We think that's fundamentally

19

The question of what the government -- what

20

are fair game questions for a defendant to ask once the

21

handler is on the stand is a -- is a different question.

22

And --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And judges do this

24

thousands of times in thousands of cases.

25

Was the tip reliable?

They ask:

There are any number of

permutations.

2

trial judge was -- made a correct determination in

3

determining that there was or was not sufficient cause

4

for the police to proceed.

5

It's a question of whether or not the

MR. PALMORE:

It just happens every day.
I think that's right, Your

6

Honor, but I think the -- the critical aspect of

7

reliability in this context is the dog's performance in

8

a controlled setting.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Palmore, you

10

criticize the Florida Supreme Court for requiring

11

evidence of field performance; and, assuming that that

12

evidence is not required, if the defendant, in preparing

13

for the suppression motion, wants what information there

14

is, would it be proper to seek -- for the defendant --

15

would it be permissible for the defendant to speak -- to

16

seek through discovery whatever field performance

17

records there are?

18

MR. PALMORE:

We don't think so, certainly

19

not as a routine basis.

The kind of burden that that

20

might impose on law enforcement we don't think is

21

justified.

22

That's a separate question from whether the

23

defendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the

24

stand, about field performance, and then the court can

25

give that answer whatever weight is appropriate.
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We think, typically, an answer on field

2

performance is not going to be material.

3

to be helpful.

4

when a dog alerts, the dog is trained to alert to the

5

odor of drugs.

6

It's not going

Because the problem is in the field,

Your -- it's like a -- what the -- Florida

7

Supreme Court wanted a batting average, a batting

8

average that would be calculated when we know the number

9

of at bats, but we don't know in many cases whether

10

there was a hit or an out.

11

we know the denominator but not the numerator.

12

So we had a fraction where

The answer to the Florida supreme court's

13

question and concern about reliability, again, is to go

14

back to the controlled setting, where we know what's a

15

hit and what's an out, and we can calculate a reliable

16

batting average.

17

should be in determining the reliability of a dog.

18

That needs to be where the focus

And there should -- there's no reason to

19

constitutionalize the process or the training

20

methodologies that get you to that point.

21

is, is this dog successful in a setting in which we can

22

measure success.

23

What matters

And I think that it's also important to

24

point out that the Florida court was basically alone in

25

establishing these unprecedented and inflexible sets of
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidentiary requirements.

2

There is a large body of case law in the

3

lower courts on the reliability of drug detection dogs

4

going back 30 or 40 years, and there are no other

5

courts, no other appellate courts to be sure, that have

6

imposed these kinds of requirements on law enforcement

7

when it seeks to establish probable cause for a

8

detection -- for after a detection dog alerts.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you take out the Florida

10

Supreme Court and this one trial court in Massachusetts,

11

basically you think what courts have been doing is the

12

right thing?

13

MR. PALMORE:

In general.

There is some

14

diversity across the courts, but I think that if you

15

look at Judge Gorsuch's opinion in the Ludwig case from

16

the Tenth Circuit, or the Jones case from the Virginia

17

supreme court, you see approaches that are basically

18

sound, where courts have confidence that if law

19

enforcement comes in and says, this dog is trained and

20

has demonstrated proficiency in a training setting, that

21

that dog is generally reliable.

22

And I think, as Mr. Garre --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But where at the same time

24

they'll allow a defendant to question the handler about

25

that training, about how the dog has performed in that
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

training; is that right?

2

MR. PALMORE:

3

Yes.

Those questions can be

asked.

4

But I think it's critical, as Mr. Garre

5

pointed out, that the courts not constitutionalize dog

6

training methodologies or hold mini trials with expert

7

witnesses on what makes for a successful dog training

8

program.

9

critical interests, life and death interests, that it

10
11

Because, as Mr. Garre said, the government has

stakes on the reliability of these dogs.
So the U.S. Marshals use dogs to protect

12

Federal judges.

13

dogs to keep bombs out of Federal buildings.

14

uses dogs to keep bombs off of airplanes.

15

dogs to find survivors after hurricanes.

16

The Federal Protective Services use
The TSA

FEMA uses

There are 32 K-9 teams in the field right

17

now in New York and New Jersey looking for survivors of

18

Hurricane Sandy.

19

So, in situation after situation, the

20

government has in a sense put its money where its mouth

21

is, and it believes at an institutional level that these

22

dogs are quite reliable.

23

And I think the courts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- I'm not

24

sure it's relevant, but do dogs -- are their -- does

25

26
Alderson Reporting Company

In other

1

words, if you have a dog that's trained and good at

2

sniffing out heroin, the same dog is going to be good at

3

detecting a bomb, or is there some difference?

4

MR. PALMORE:

No, there -- well, I think any

5

dog could be trained in either discipline.

guide a court in probable cause determinations.

Now, do -- do you disavow that or -- or do

MR. GIFFORD:

What?
That is -- that is not the

holding on which I'm relying here.

The holding on which

10

I'm relying is that training and certification alone,

11

the mere fact of training and certification alone, is

12

not sufficient to establish the dog's reliability.

13

And as to the language about "must,"

14

remember, the Florida Supreme Court didn't just say that

15

the failure to produce one of these elements

16

necessitated reversal.

17

It then went and engaged in a totality of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if this is absent in

MR. GIFFORD:

"Must" means "must" if the

MR. GIFFORD:

I read that as:

If those

8

records exist, the state must produce them, because not

9

only does it bear the burden of proof; it's the only

10

party that can produce these records because it keeps

11

the dog.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose it's -- it's a

13

dog that's just completed the training, training course,

14

top-performing dog in the training program, but there's

15

no field record.

16

MR. GIFFORD:

If that -- if the training is

17

sufficient, if it has those elements that demonstrate

18

that the dog is reliable, those are the circumstances.

19

You have the totality of the circumstances there and

20

those circumstances don't include any field performance.

21

And, yes, under that circumstance, a trial court can

22

find the dog to be reliable.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

state's argument that field performance records are not

2

4

5

wrong with that?

6

MR. GIFFORD:

What's

Well, you don't know whether

7

they're cases of false alerts or not, because the state

8

will always point to the possibility of residual odor as

9

a reason.

And we know from the studies that have been

10

cited in the briefs that there are other reasons that

11

dogs alert when that alert cannot be verified.

Dogs get excited and will

Well, that may all be true,

17

but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a

18

dog alerted a number of times when no contraband was

19

found?
I think what you just said was the

20
21

explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the

22

substance wasn't there, or it could be that the dog was

23

cued or the dog was confused or the dog is not very

24

competent.

25

performance records?

So what can one infer from these field

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GIFFORD:

Well, what you can infer is

2

this dog is not a very accurate indicator of probable

3

cause, because probable cause tests whether drugs are

4

likely to be found in a search that follows an alert.

5

If the dog's --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

found if there is a residual odor of drugs, even though

8

the drugs are no longer there.

9

incompetent dog when he alerts because of the residual

10
11

So it's not an

odor.
MR. GIFFORD:

But if a dog has -- but if a

12

dog has previously alerted and no drugs have been found

13

because the dog's hyperacuity causes him to smell drugs

14

that were there two days or two weeks ago, then the next

15

time that dog alerts, it's less likely, the probability

16

declines that drugs will be found.

17

It goes to what probable cause measures,

18

rather than what the dog training and certification

19

community measure, and that is, the likelihood, the

20

reasonable probability, that drugs will be found

21

following the search.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, how is that any

23

different than a police officer who comes to a car and

24

25

He's never going to know whether

6

I don't know how long

It's no different than an

He doesn't actually know whether it's

7

physically still present or not, but we're talking about

8

probabilities.

9

MR. GIFFORD:

That's correct.

And -- and

10

the difference is that -- that the police officer can

11

describe what he has smelled and can say, I smell

12

marijuana.

14

operating correctly.

All the dog tells the police officer is, I

But getting to this -- this issue of

15
16

residual odor, our position is that an alert where no

17

drugs are found means that the dog -- that -- it

18

detracts from probable cause in that instance.

19

But that's not the only rule available to

20

the court.

21

residual odor and is therefore correct and accurate, is

22

something that can be litigated.

23

Residual odor, whether an alert was to

24

case after the Florida Supreme Court, the court looked

25

to the field performance records, and it found several
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of them well supported on the issue of whether the alert

2

was probably to the odor of drugs; several it didn't

3

find.

So that is an issue that can be litigated.

4

Another possibility is --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, excuse me.

6

Where -- when nothing is found, how can you tell whether

7

the dog alerted to a residual odor or simply made a

8

mistake?

9

Now, there may be cases where there is other

10

evidence that suggests that drugs were present in that

11

location, and, therefore, that is something from which

12

you could infer that the dog was alerting to residual

13

odor; but, the fact that you don't have evidence of that

14

doesn't mean that there wasn't residual odor.
MR. GIFFORD:

15

No, it doesn't mean that there

16

wasn't residual odor.

17

probable cause measures, I believe.

18

But, again, you go back to what

And the Florida Supreme Court didn't demand

19

evidence of residual odor.

20

if field performance records exist, then the state can

21

explain unverified alerts in the field as residual odor,

22

and then a court can then evaluate that.

23

What it did is it said that

number?

What percentage of accurate alerts or

25

inaccurate is enough for probable cause?
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GIFFORD:

Well, this Court has always

2

hesitated to assign percentages to probable cause; but,

3

in the lower courts, once you get below 50 percent,

4

probable cause is much less likely to be found, assuming

5

that there is no other corroborative evidence, no other

6

reasonable suspicion factors.

7

9

I'd like to talk briefly about the Oregon
supreme court and what that court did in several cases.
Helzer and Foster decided in 2011,

10

independently of the Florida Supreme Court decision,

11

doesn't cite Harris; in Foster, the Oregon supreme court

12

had a dog that trained initially with the same handler,

13

unlike here, where the evidence was very strong as to

14

the features of the training and certification program,

15

and where that dog had, I believe, a 66 percent field

16

performance record.

17

Now, the court in Foster said that the dog's

18

reliability can be established by training,

19

certification, and performance in the field.

20

added that it didn't think that performance in the field

21

was the most reliable measure, but it's relevant, and

22

the court considered that 66 percent percentage.

23

The court

But then, on the same day, in Helzer, there

24

was a dog that trained initially with a different

25

handler, that the handler ultimately testified to very

1

few details of the ongoing training and the

2

certification.

3

In Foster, the certification was with an

4

organization that required a 90 percent success rate.

5

In Helzer, there was no such testimony.

6

And this officer, like the officer here,

7

didn't keep field performance records when the dog

8

alerted and no drugs were found.

9

In Helzer, the court found that there was

10

insufficient evidence of reliability.

11

that those two cases demonstrate what is a -- what is a

12

correct line to draw in navigating what is reliable.

13

And I believe

On several arguments made by the state, the

14

argument was that the maintenance training included

15

blanks, and that the dog did not alert to blanks.

16

record, we believe, supports the Florida supreme court's

17

conclusion that blanks were tested -- the dog was tested

18

on blanks, but there was no testimony as to whether the

19

dog didn't alert on those blanks.

20

The

The state has said that the dog was

21

subsequently recertified.

I don't find support in the

22

record for that.

23

argued -- the officer testified that the dog was

scheduled for another certification, but we don't know

25

whether the dog was ever recertified.

then that residual odor alert would support probable

residual odor alerting without any explanation by the

the lack of performance records and the lack of records

that this dog was reliable.

The fact that Aldo alerted to the door

probable cause that Officer Wheetley had to search.
