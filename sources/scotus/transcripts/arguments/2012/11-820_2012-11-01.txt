ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

We'll hear argument

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In the more than 20 years since this Court

12

decided Teague v. Lane, it's had more than a dozen cases

13

in which people have sought habeas relief based on

14

ineffective assistance of counsel, but this Court has

15

never once held that applying Strickland in those

16

divergent factual settings constituted a new rule.

17

For two reasons, this Court should reject

18

the government's argument to do so for the first time

19

here.

20

First, Padilla was dictated by precedent;

21

that is, like other Strickland cases that came before

22

it, this Court in Padilla simply applied Strickland's

23

formula of assessing attorney performance according to

24

prevailing professional norms to a new set of facts.

25

The second -3

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a surprise to

2

the, what, ten courts of appeals who came out the other

3

way?

4
5

MR. FISHER:
Your Honor.

6

No, I don't think so,

Two -- two things about the lower courts.
The first is, there are only three lower

7

court decisions that postdate the 1996 act that the

8

government can cite that came out the other way in terms

9

of the question presented here.

10

And the second thing is, even within those

11

cases and within those courts, they didn't distinguish

12

between deportation advice and other kinds of advice.

13

They distinguished between acts and omissions; that is

14

to say, it was a uniform rule in the lower courts at the

15

time this Court decided Padilla that misadvice

16

concerning the right to -- I'm sorry, concerning

17

deportation consequences of a plea did violate

18

Strickland.

19

So the distinction in lower courts was not

20

between deportation advice and other kinds of advice;

21

the distinction was between acts and omissions.

22

And in Padilla itself --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So maybe it

24

was -- maybe it was a surprise to the members of this

25

Court that disagreed with that -4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. FISHER:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

No --- with the ruling

in Padilla.

4

MR. FISHER:

Well, obviously, there was a

5

dissent in Padilla, but this Court has held before that

6

new applications of Strickland did not constitute a new

7

rule, even though there were dissents.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. FISHER:

In Williams --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Mr. Fisher --

-- what -- what about the

11

argument that Strickland doesn't come into play unless

12

the Sixth Amendment includes the collateral consequences

13

in counsel's obligation to defend a defendant in a

14

criminal case under the argument that up to -- up to

15

Padilla, only advice relevant to guilt or innocence and

16

sentencing was required, not collateral consequences?

17

MR. FISHER:

Well, that was obviously the

18

argument that the State of Kentucky made in that case,

19

and this Court dealt with it in part two of Padilla.
Now, remember, Justice Ginsburg, the Court

20
21

did not extend Strickland to collateral consequences in

22

Padilla.

23

held is that deportation consequences are not removed

24

from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment.

25

It actually reserved that question.

So, remember, Strickland -5
Alderson Reporting Company

What it

Official

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's also a question

2

if -- if conviction meant loss of a professional

3

license, that would be an open question?

4
5

MR. FISHER:

I think -- I think that's an

open question after Padilla.

6

What this Court held in Padilla -- and this

7

is the second to last sentence in part two -- is that

8

advice concerning deportation consequences of a guilty

9

plea are not categorically removed from the Sixth

10

Amendment.

11

So what I understood the Court to do in

12

Padilla was take the ordinary Strickland formula of

13

prevailing professional norms and simply apply it to

14

this criminal case.

15

criminal case.

16

Remember, Padilla itself was a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's always the case.

17

I mean, we -- we never come out with a decision that

18

doesn't rely upon some preexisting principle.

19

cite some preexisting principle.

20

every case of ours is -- is not new law?

21

MR. FISHER:

We always

Does that mean that

Of course not.

The question

22

this Court asked under Teague is whether it broke new

23

ground.

24

we reject the artificial restriction on Strickland that

25

the lower courts have created; so, therefore, this Court

And I think what this Court said in Padilla is,

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

simply reaffirmed Strickland.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

It didn't --

Well, Mr. Fisher, think

3

about this in an AEDPA context.

4

have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that

5

the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along

6

and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA

7

context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction --

8

we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law

9

is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held.

10
11
12

I mean, assume that you

Wouldn't we think that that's a very easy
case that the AEDPA standard had not been met?
MR. FISHER:

I think you -- you may well

13

find that, Justice Kagan, but the reason why is because

14

you'd find that there was not an unreasonable

15

application of preexisting law.

16

is that the clearly established law is any different.

What you would not say

17

So, remember, this Court -- this case,

18

because it's a Federal case, raises only the first

19

question under AEDPA, in a sense, which is what's the

20

clearly established law?

21

think this is responsive to the Chief Justice's question

22

about the dissent.

23

And this is the Chief -- I

There was a disagreement on this Court about

24

how to apply Strickland, but the question's whether a

25

new legal rule was created, not whether there was an
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unreasonable application --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why pick on Strickland?

I

3

mean, you could say that about any principle of law that

4

we rely on:

5

applied a different way here.

The dissent thought that that principle

6

What is different about Strickland that it

7

enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing

8

to any principle of law?

9

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the best response

10

is what this Court said in Williams, which is Strickland

11

provides sufficient guidance to resolve virtually every

12

ineffective assistance claim.

13
14

So what this Court said in Williams is we do
not make new law when we apply Strickland.

15

I think Justice Kennedy --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any -- Mr.

17

Fisher, is there any application, you call it application

18

of Strickland, that would qualify as a new rule, any

19

application at all, or is just Strickland never a new

20

rule?

21
22
23

MR. FISHER:

I think so long as you simply

applied Strickland, you wouldn't create a new rule.
If you for example, said, a certain kind of

24

claim does not need to have a prejudice showing, that

25

would be a new rule.
8

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose that a

2

really skilled attorney, after negotiating a plea

3

bargain, or even representing a client at trial but then

4

losing, is very skilled in ensuring that the defendant

5

can go into the general population, not into solitary

6

confinement; but also a skilled trial attorney, he's

7

just not very good at that, so the defendant goes to

8

solitary.

9

Could -- if there was an evolution of the

10

law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court

11

later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a

12

part of the attorney's -- skill and competence in

13

representation, that that would be retroactive?

14

MR. FISHER:

Justice Kennedy, it wouldn't be

15

enough to have a later evolution of prevailing norms

16

because Strickland is a backward-looking device.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that there are then, in

18

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, some cases in

19

which there could be a new rule of ineffective

20

assistance of counsel under Strickland?

21

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the answer to

22

that question is yes, and, as I said, something like a

23

scenario where this Court --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Well, I don't understand

how that works with my hypothetical.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FISHER:

Well, let me -- let me try to

2

work with your hypothetical.

3

hypothetical to say is that prevailing norms change, and

4

they evolve to a certain point where certain kinds of

5

advice is required, which is much what this Court said

6

in Padilla about -- about deportation advice.

7

I think what I hear your

You would have -- you would not have a new

8

rule to simply recognize that at the time that attorney

9

gave advice, that -- that Strickland was violated.

10

It would be a new rule, I think,

11

Justice Kennedy, to say that Strickland requires relief,

12

even though at the time the advice was given the

13

prevailing norm had not yet crystalized into the degree

14

that this Court requires.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

The only new law is not a

16

new pronouncement which nobody had ever thought of

17

before, but only a pronouncement that rests upon an

18

evolution of mores; is that it?

19
20

MR. FISHER:
say is --

21
22
23

No, I think what I'm trying to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what I thought you

said.
MR. FISHER:

-- Strickland -- Strickland

24

sets up a two-part test, and we're only talking about

25

the first part, which is attorney performance.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

that -- that question is keyed to attorney performance

2

at the time judged by reasonableness according to

3

prevailing professional norms.

4

Now, those prevailing professional norms

5

are, in a sense, a factual question, an empirical

6

question that --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fisher, it would seem to

8

me that this case presents a kind of threshold question.

9

Before you get to the question of what are prevailing

10

professional norms and whether they have been complied

11

with, there is the question of whether the Sixth

12

Amendment applies to collateral consequences at all and,

13

if so, which collateral consequences.

14

And that’s the question on which Padilla

15

opines, and that's the question that seems, you know,

16

very different from anything that Strickland’s discussed,

17

not just an application of Strickland.

18

MR. FISHER:

Well, let me give you two

19

answers to that, because I think that's the government's

20

main argument here.

21

First is, as I've tried to say before,

22

simply saying that an exception that the lower courts

23

created doesn't exist -- doesn't create a new rule.

24

Imagine this Court said -- laid down a rule that covered

25

all cars, and the lower courts devised an exception to
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that rule for convertibles.

And when the Court -- when

2

the issue came to this Court, this Court said, well, no,

3

when we said all cars, we meant all cars.

4

To me, that doesn't create a new rule.

5

I think that's what this Court said in part two of

6

Padilla, is that this artificial restriction that the

7

lower courts have devised simply can't be grounded in

8

Strickland --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

How many had?

Pardon me?
How many had?

I mean, I

12

would have thought it was common sense that a lawyer

13

should tell the client the terrible things that are

14

going to happen to him if he pleads guilty, those things

15

that the lawyer knows or should know about and the

16

client may not.

17

at that level.

18

Alright.

That's a very general rule

But some courts have said, no, that isn't

19

true.

20

Kagan said, if it's a collateral exception, if it's a

21

collateral consequence.

22

Kentucky, or was it fairly widespread, this exception?

23
24
25

That isn't true unless -- if it's -- as Justice

MR. FISHER:

How many had?

Was it only

Only three federal circuits

had had a ruling like that after the 1996 act -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there aren't that

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

many.

There are eleven, and two of them are

2

specialized.

3

MR. FISHER:

Well, if I can finish my

4

answer, only three had rulings like that after the 1996

5

act, and all three of those relied on pre-'96 act

6

rulings.

7

just not quite enough for us to be entitled to overturn

8

our prior circuit precedent.

And as court of appeals judges said, that's

9

So while the government comes here today

10

and suggests that ten circuits and all these state

11

courts had ruled, in a sense, in its favor, you know,

12

it's almost more accurate to say none had had this issue

13

cleanly presented to them after the 1996 act.

14

And, Justice Kagan, if I --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but even before the

16

1996 act, deportation -- there were deportation

17

consequences.

18

1996 act; but, even before that, a reasonable lawyer,

19

you might think, would have a conversation with his

20

client about the deportation consequences of a

21

conviction.

22

Those consequences were enhanced by the

MR. FISHER:

That may well be true, Justice

23

Kagan, but I'm saying in the '96 act, as this Court said

24

in Padilla, whatever prevail -- whatever doubt there may

25

have been about prevailing professional norms
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crystallized at that time because of the severity.

2

And I think that's the second answer I

3

wanted to give to your question about this so-called

4

threshold question in Padilla, is that even if there is

5

some question as to whether the Sixth Amendment applies

6

beyond, as the government puts it, criminal jeopardy,

7

this Court had already answered that question in St. Cyr,

8

where this Court said, in the text around footnotes 48

9

and 50, that any competent lawyer would give his client

10

advice and a warning about deportation consequences of a

11

plea.

12

So even if you needed more than Strickland

13

itself, St. Cyr gave that to you in 2001, which is

14

enough to decide this case; it was enough to decide

15

Padilla.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

If a court -- if this Court

17

were to decide in a future case that effective

18

assistance of counsel requires an attorney to advise the

19

client of all collateral consequences, potential loss of

20

a professional license, etc., would that be a rule that

21

was dictated by precedent?

22

MR. FISHER:

I think it would -- I doubt it,

23

Justice Alito.

24

prevailing professional norms looked like.

25

I think it would depend on what the

I take it what this Court said in Strickland
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and what it reaffirmed in Padilla is, we're not going

2

to -- we're not going to micromanage effective

3

assistance of counsel.

4

prevailing professional norms.

5

We're going to leave it to

I seriously doubt that prevailing

6

professional norms would require the holding that you

7

described; but, to the extend they did, I don't think it

8

would be a new rule.

9

this Court said, we're going to push the Sixth Amendment

To the extent they didn't and

10

beyond that, you would have a new rule.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Fisher, I suppose you

12

are right, I'm sure you're right that the mere fact that

13

there was a dissent in the case that adopted the rule

14

does not necessarily make it a new rule.

15

the other hand, would agree, would you not, that those

16

who dissented from that case would regard it as a new

17

rule?

18

MR. FISHER:

19

answer, Justice Scalia.

20
21
22

But you, on

That's a tricky question to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think it's an easy

question to answer.
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think I could answer it

23

one of two ways.

One is I could say yes, they did -- to

24

the extent they did regard it as a new rule, I think the

25

dissent was, with all due respect, slightly mistaken
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about what the holding in Padilla was, which was not

2

to --

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fair.

That's fair.

The dissenters ought to reconsider, you're saying.

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that the way the

6

dissent put it was -- is that advice is now required

7

beyond criminal cases and criminal jeopardy.

8
9

The way that I think Padilla -- majority
described its holding was that this is a criminal

10

defendant in a criminal case entitled to advice from his

11

criminal lawyer, and the most important piece of advice

12

as to whether to take a plea or not involves deportation

13

consequences.

14

And, Justice Scalia, I think --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it just seems to me

16

that the predicate question that we decided in Padilla

17

was that Strickland applies to matters not within the

18

control of the trial judge.

19

holding the Court had not addressed before and that

20

other courts had not addressed before.

21

MR. FISHER:

That it seems to me was a

Well, it had to be more than

22

that, Justice Kennedy, because, of course, there is lots

23

of --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MR. FISHER:

No, this is --

-- ineffective assistance
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cases –-

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. FISHER:

-- a predicate question.

Well, no, no.

But I'm saying

4

there are lots of ineffective assistance cases before

5

Padilla that involved matters beyond the judge, that

6

turned on what the jury did, of course.

7

I may be able to think of others beyond those two

8

scenarios, but there's no language to that effect in

9

Padilla.

And I could --

What the Court said is that we have never

10
11

created artificial distinctions about what an attorney

12

has to do.

13

Strickland itself, the client is advised to his lawyer's

14

advice about all important decisions.

15

said in St. Cyr and other cases, the most important

16

consideration as to whether to plead guilty is whether

17

somebody will be deported.

18

As this Court put it in Strickland,

19

And as this Court

And so you put that together and you had all
of the law you needed, certainly by 2001.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

I think you've

21

been -- you've been asked this, and I'm not sure I got

22

your answer.

23

like the consequences in Padilla that would not be

24

covered by your argument?

25

Give me an example of something that --

MR. FISHER:

Well, some sort of consequences
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that -- that prevailing norms didn't require a lawyer to

2

advise his client on.

3

So, for example, I would expect that a

4

lawyer is not necessarily required to give detailed

5

advice about future employment opportunities to a client

6

depending on whether he pleads guilty.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You answered that

8

question when I asked it, you said that removal of a

9

professional license would not fall under -- wouldn't --

10

would be at least an open question.

11

MR. FISHER:

It -- I think it would be an

12

open question as to how Strickland would apply.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. FISHER:

15
16

If you had --

I simply don't know what the

prevailing professional norms are in that situation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you had that

17

case, what would you rely on in arguing in favor of the

18

habeas petition?

19

MR. FISHER:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

Well, I would start with -You would start with

Strickland, and you would talk with -- Padilla, right?
MR. FISHER:

Yes, that's what I would do.

23

And I would look to prevailing professional norms.

24

And I think, if I could give a generic

25

answer, the question would be whether or not that kind
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of advice is so important to the client's decision

2

making -- and that's the word the Court used in

3

Strickland -- that prevailing norms require the lawyer

4

to give that kind of advice.

5

If the answer to that was yes --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you want us to write

7

this opinion in support of your position, and to begin

8

by saying, prevailing professional norms do not change?

9
10

MR. FISHER:

No, no, Justice Kennedy.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that

11

you're -- that the defense bar generally would want to

12

say that prevailing professional norms change, but

13

that -- that hurts you in this case.

14

MR. FISHER:

No, I don't think it does,

15

Justice Kennedy.

16

that prevailing professional norms can and do evolve.

17

And so the question this Court asked in Strickland is,

18

as of the time the advice was given, did the prevailing

19

norms require that?

20

I agree with your premise, I think,

The advice was given in this case almost at

21

the identical time of the advice in Padilla and, indeed,

22

far after St. Cyr.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I notice -- I'm not sure

24

it was cited in the brief, but the ABA comment in 1999

25

said, now the ABA standard applies to professional
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

standards, and that goes beyond the constitutional

2

minimum.

3

either.

4

So that doesn't seem to me to help you,

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm not sure that's what

5

the ABA said.

6

we don't make constitutional law in this body; we leave

7

that to the courts.

8
9

I believe the ABA, quite rightly, said,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It said, it should be

stated that these standards do more than enforce the

10

constitutional minimum.

11

MR. FISHER:

12

me, does not help you.

21

MR. FISHER:

Well, then I'll rely on just

22

the overall body of professional norms, which is what

23

this Court looked to in Padilla and what it's always

24

said it has to look to under Strickland cases.

25

If I could return -- if I could transition
20

1

to talking about the -- the nature of the

2

backward-looking effect of Strickland, I think there is

3

an important second question in this case, that if this

4

Court were inclined to hold that there was a new rule,

5

you'd be forced to confront.

6

question involving this Court's administration of

7

criminal appellate procedure.

8

Teague ought to apply at all in this context.

9

And it's a very serious

And that is whether

We believe that under the system this Court

10

established in Massaro for handling IAC claims, it

11

simply doesn't make any sense to apply Teague here and,

12

indeed, would throw a gigantic monkey wrench into the

13

way things are -- have been done for the last decade

14

after that decision.
And -- and for two reasons:

15
16

theory --

17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fisher, before you get

to the reasons --

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

One, in

Yes.
-- the government says that

you forfeited this argument.

22

MR. FISHER:

Could you address that?

Sure.

We didn't forfeit this

23

argument.

It's fairly included within our question

24

presented.

25

opportunity in the Seventh Circuit because we were

We raised it at the first available

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

foreclosed by circuit precedent from raising it.

2

raised it before an en banc court.

So we

3

And in our cert reply brief, lest there be

4

any doubt, when the government suggested that we would

5

be restricted to arguing the new rule question in this

6

case, we put a footnote in our cert reply brief which

7

expressly told the Court, no, we view this question

8

presented as including this additional argument, whether

9

Teague applies or not.
So I think we gave fair notice to the Court.

10
11

And if you have any doubt --

12
13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you haven't presented

this argument to any court before; is that right?

14

MR. FISHER:

We made the argument in an

15

en banc petition to the Seventh Circuit, which we

16

couldn't make it to a panel because Seventh Circuit law

17

had already held that Teague applied in this context.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it relevant that this is

19

a coram nobis proceeding, rather than a habeas

20

proceeding?

21
22

MR. FISHER:

No.

I think we agree with the

government that it doesn't -- matter.

23

The way we see this is it's a first Federal

24

filing.

It's a first post-conviction filing, and it's a

25

timely filing.

The government is not challenging the
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

timeliness of this filing.

2

So the question you have to ask yourself is,

3

under a system where this Court has said that IAC claims

4

should not be brought on direct review, but rather

5

should be brought on collateral review, whether you can

6

apply Teague at the very first instance that somebody

7

has to make a constitutional claim, and we think not.

8

On theory --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

On that question, before

10

you -- not in relation to the Massaro argument, but in

11

relation to the Teague argument, you think the rule in

12

coram nobis is the same, that the Teague rule applies

13

fully in coram nobis in the same way that it applies in

14

habeas?
MR. FISHER:

15

Well, that's the way the whole

16

case has been litigated, and I think that's a fair

17

assumption.

18
19

The reason that we're on coram nobis instead
of --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. FISHER:

Have we ever held that?

No, you haven't.

And so if you

22

want to be extra careful, you can -- you can say the

23

parties haven't challenged that.

24
25

Remember, the reason that we're on coram
nobis is Ms. Chaidez was not in custody.
23
Alderson Reporting Company

And so if

Official

1

somebody -- so it's, in a sense, interchangeable with a

2

2255.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, yes, I understand

4

that, but the consequences of a retroactive application

5

in coram nobis are more severe than they are in habeas,

6

aren't they, because of the lack of a statute of

7

limitations?

8

MR. FISHER:

More severe in the sense -- I'm

9

not sure I understand in what sense.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

You -- well, in -- under --

11

under the current Federal habeas statute, you have a

12

rather short statute of limitations to file the habeas

13

petition.

14

Under coram nobis, if you prevail, then

15

people who were -- who were convicted of offenses

16

decades ago can raise the Padilla claim, can they not?

17

MR. FISHER:

I'm not sure they -- I'm not

18

sure they could, Justice Alito.

19

see the district court dealing with the timeliness of

20

this petition.

21

Chaidez could proceed because she used all reasonable

22

diligence in bringing this claim.

23

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

arguments go in the Seventh Circuit and don't raise them

2

again here.

3

But I think that, at a minimum, it would be

4

fair to say that somebody needs to bring a petition as

5

soon as the government advises them they're going to

6

seek deportation.

7

I'm not even sure, Justice Alito --

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

What if someone -- if there

is an attempt to -- a notice of removal for someone

10

based on a conviction that occurred a long time ago,

11

then that would be --

12

MR. FISHER:

You could -- you could have a

13

time lag, but there is two things to remember.

14

is, you might have a timely 2255 in that circumstance,

15

too, because, remember, in Holland v. Florida, this

16

Court held that equitable tolling is available for

17

people with IA -- with ineffective assistance that leads

18

to them not being able to make the claim earlier.

19

First

And the second thing is, as I was discussing

20

with Justice Kennedy, the backward-looking aspect of

21

Strickland would -- would require the party -- once you

22

get more than a little while back, the prevailing norms

23

may not -- may not be there for that kind of a claim.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher, are

2

you -- you're not making any argument that Teague is

3

inapplicable because this -- the underlying conviction

4

here is a federal conviction, not a state conviction,

5

and Teague emphasized comity to the states; you're not

6

making that argument?

7

MR. FISHER:

No, I think you could hold

8

that, and that is -- that is within our argument.

As you said, this Court has said time and again that

12

case.

13

That's not present in this

But we think a narrower way to decide this

14

case, and I think the appropriate way to decide this

15

case, is to say, at least for ineffective assistance

16

claims, when you're bringing -- with a Federal prisoner,

17

or somebody who has been convicted of a Federal crime,

18

that's bringing their first petition, that Teague can't

19

apply.

20
21
22

And what I was just trying to say is
Strickland itself -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, except -- except

23

that -- and I'm interrupting, in a sense, but it's on

24

the same track -- except that it seems to me that Teague

25

does serve the interest of repose, quite apart from
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interference with a federal proceeding, and that

2

interest is surely sacrificed by the holding you wish us

3

to make here.

4
5
6

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm glad

you asked because that was what I was going to say.
In Strickland, this Court dealt with

7

finality very explicitly and said, we're creating this

8

standard which is different than other constitutional

9

standards because we're concerned about finality.

And,

10

as this Court said at pages 697 and 98, so, therefore,

11

no different rules ought to apply in collateral

12

proceedings as in direct review, because this Court

13

assumed in Strickland itself and it assumed expressly

14

again in Padilla that all of these claims would be on

15

collateral review.

16

So in all these cases the Court has said

17

finality -- the concern -- the very concern you

18

mentioned, Justice Kennedy, is already baked into the

19

Strickland formula.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, I'm

21

concerned that creating exceptions to exceptions in

22

Teague is just a throwback to Linkletter standard --

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Well --- where we're making

choices among situations and saying, these will be

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Answer that concern on

Yes.
And then answer -- the

next step is the Martinez type case --

8

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which is what happens

situation?

13

MR. FISHER:

So what trumps what in that

Okay.

Let me answer both those

14

things.

15

an exception to Teague.

16

to say Teague doesn't apply when a claim is, quote, "on

17

the equivalent of direct review," which is what this

18

Court said in Martinez v. Ryan.

19

held with respect to IAC that habeas rules, like the

20

procedural default rule and like the Stone v. Powell bar

21

against Fourth Amendment claims, don’t apply in the IAC

22

context.

23

holdings.

24
25

First, we’re not asking this Court to create
We’re simply asking this Court

This Court has already

So this follows exactly from those previous

Now, let me say two other things and then I
can hopefully reserve my time.

To answer your question

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about Martinez in state cases, it would depend on what

2

the state system looked like, and I think states have

3

their own decision to make as to whether they want a

4

system like Arizona's, where these have to be brought in

5

collateral proceedings, or whether, as I understand at

6

least a couple of states do, say, we're going to stay

7

and delay the entire direct review process, for years

8

often, to allow the IAC claim to be brought then.

9

Now, that's exactly what this Court rejected in

10

Massaro, and the government asked this Court to reject

11

that in Massaro; said we don't want that kind of a

12

system.

13

it for the first time today.

14

I don't know why the government is asking for

And finally remember, the last thing I would

15

like to say is, all these problems raise not only

16

finality concerns about the stay and remand procedures

17

the government suggests; they also raise insoluble

18

conflicts of interest problems for federal defender

19

offices, who would have to bring IAC claims against

20

themselves on direct review in order to preserve their

21

ability to -- to get full relief for their client.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Perhaps on rebuttal -- I

23

recognize the white light's on -- you could address what

24

is -- what is the standard you want me to apply to

25

determine retroactivity?

The brief says, oh, well, it's
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just new facts applying to the same general rule.

2

danger invites rescue; the assault on privity is

3

proceeding to pace; MacPherson v. Buick and the Erie

4

Railroad case -- it seems to me that those were probably

5

new rules, but there -- it's because the facts told us

6

what should be negligent.

7

address that, I don't --

8
9

MR. FISHER:

Well,

If at some point you could

Justice Kennedy, what I would

like to do, and I am happy to elaborate, is the

10

formulation as I think you yourself put it in Wright v.

11

West, which is that a rule that is -- that is applied to

12

a new set of facts does not create a new rule; but if

13

you advance the law in some way you do create a new

14

rule.
The last thing I would like to say about

15
16

consequences is:

Remember, the government doesn't even

17

have any answer for what is going to be half or more of

18

the situations where people have Padilla-type claims,

19

which is when they have a guilty plea and waive their

20

right to direct appeal.

21

like this is -- is absolutely the equivalent of direct

22

review.

23

of going down that road.

So there the collateral filing

And so I think this Court ought to be very wary

24

If I could reserve the time I have left.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

In Padilla v. Kentucky this Court announced

7

a new rule within the meaning of Teague v. Lane.

8

Because --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think that's true

10

with respect to both components of the advice, the

11

omission and commission?

12

every court who dealt with the commission-type claim,

13

the fraud, the misrepresentation of consequences, said

14

it's clear you can't lie to your client.

15

now going -- is our ruling here going to depend on the

16

type of claim that's raised, with respect to IAC?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, it does appear that

Now, is Teague

18

Court in Padilla didn't distinguish between misadvice

19

adopted --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it therefore

At least one of our

22

concurrences did, or talked to.

So assuming --

23

assuming -- is your position that is on the

24

retroactivity, that it applies to both kinds, omissions

25

and commissions, and neither is retroactive?
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. DREEBEN:

As for -- as for Padilla's

2

rationale, the answer is yes, but there is a rationale

3

that governed, in our view, misadvice claims that

4

existed before Padilla.

5

in Padilla.

6

concurring opinion.

7

which essentially mirrored the reasons that had been

8

given in the lower courts for treating misadvice

9

differently.

It wasn't addressed or embraced

It was addressed in Justice Alito's
Justice Alito gave two reasons

And that is, affirmative misadvice

10

violated a more basic duty of counsel that was well

11

established, which is not to represent that you're

12

competent on a matter that you are not competent.

13

And the second distinction between misadvice

14

and failure to give any advice is that a client has a

15

constitutional right to make his or her own decision

16

about whether to plead guilty; and a lawyer has a

17

constitutional duty not to get in the way of that by

18

affirmatively skewing the client's ability to make that

19

choice.
And so I would probably not disagree that

20
21

misadvice claim was not new before Padilla and it's not

22

really addressed by Padilla's rationale.

23

independent sources, and the courts that had adopted

24

that --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It has its own

I'm not sure.

MR. DREEBEN:

It's a different professional

norm and it's a different aspect of the Sixth Amendment

5

right.

6

misadvice -- there were three of them that had done it

7

in the removal context; there were three more that had

8

done it in the parole eligibility context -- they all

9

simultaneously adhered to the view that as a general

And all of the courts that had adopted

10

matter there is no obligation to give advice about

11

collateral consequences.

12

And they did this, I might add, despite the

13

fact that, as Justice Kennedy alluded, the ABA, which

14

was cited as one of the key sources of prevailing

15

professional norms, stated in Standard 14.3.2, in the

16

criminal justice pleas of guilty standards:

17

extent possible, defense counsel should determine and

18

advise the defendant sufficiently in advance of any plea

19

as to the possible collateral consequences that might

20

ensue from entry of the contemplated plea."

21

"To the

22

norm that collateral consequences would be on the table,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me

3

where -- my colleagues were asking about hypothetical

4

future cases -- I'm asking, do you think that every

evolving professional norm, no matter how well

whatever the professional standards are that exist today

of that?

entitled to relief, and you say yes, because --

the time of the decision.

15

So although the professional

contends as well?
MR. DREEBEN:

I think you probably should

ask my opponent what he contends, but Strickland is

fairly clear that professional norms at the time of the

18

attorney's action are what governs.

19
20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, so given the ABA

and everything else, why doesn't that apply here?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the ABA doesn't state

22

this Court's interpretation of the Sixth Amendment.

23

This Court made that very clear in Roe versus --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but I mean if the

general rule is that Strickland evolves to pick up
35

changing professional norms, and that -- you looked at

2

30 cases and that's what you get out of them -- and then

3

it turns out that at the time this case began, there was

4

such a professional norm; and all that happened in

5

Padilla is that the Court following its general practice

6

said apply that professional norm; then why doesn't the

7

other side win?

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, first of all,

Justice Breyer, that's not what the Court did in

10

Padilla.

11

Kagan explained, in section two of its opinion was first

12

to address the question whether a criminal defense

13

lawyer had any obligation to give advice about a

14

consequence that would not be administered in the

15

criminal case itself.

16

What the Court did in Padilla, as Justice

No decision of this Court had ever held that

17

the obligations of a criminal defense lawyer under the

18

Sixth Amendment extended to that.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

That, of course, is true,

20

but the professional norm had evolved by the time of the

21

proceeding here that they would.

MR. DREEBEN:

That was not the basis of the

has evolved and we apply the new professional norm as of

MR. DREEBEN:

Most of the cases involved

9

That doesn't

What was unique in Padilla is that the Court

10

had to address something that it had never done before,

11

whether the criminal defense lawyer had to give advice

12

about a consequence that the sentencing court had no

13

control over.

14

And in resolving that question, this Court

15

did not cite professional norms.

16

17

possibility of deportation.

19

It did not cite the

the relationship between deportation and criminal

justice, it examined its own cases that had discussed

24

that the principle that deportation is uniquely tied to

10

Yes.
Does common sense change?

Common sense may evolve -I mean, Tom Paine wrote

about it, so, you know, since its original.
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Kennedy, I think the

12

Court relied on the idea that any lawyer worth his salt

13

would inform a defendant about a particularly important

14

consequence, a momentous consequence of pleading guilty.

15

You probably would say the same thing to

16

somebody who you knew was an avowed hunter and would

17

lose the right to have firearms, or a politician that

18

would lose the right to hold office, or a doctor who

19

would lose a medical license, all of which can be

20

automatic consequences of a conviction; actually, more

21

automatic than deportation, because deportation is

22

intuition that good lawyers should advise their clients

about the panoply of consequences that they will

Padilla, the Court had never veered from the track of

saying the lawyer's duty is to help the client figure

out what his odds are of prevailing at trial, what the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dreeben, Padilla

11

itself was a collateral proceeding.

12

can argue in Padilla itself that a new rule was being

sought and that that was permissible only on direct

14

review, should the state have prevailed?

in a case coming from a state system Teague has anything

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's a little bit like

the AEDPA standard.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

It's similar.

I think the

4

Court has said that things that don't count as new rules

5

under Teague can also be cognizable under AEDPA.

6

has a contrary to provision, as well as an unreasonable

7

application provision, as Mr. Fisher pointed out; but,

8

as far as the contrary to provision works, it parallels

9

Teague.

10

So we're not asking the Court to make any

11

new rules up about Teague.

12

to apply Teague.

13

AEDPA

We're asking the Court to --

And in the application of Teague, the

14

government is relying on this Court's form of analysis,

15

which is you look at the state of the law at the time of

16

the decision in question, when the decision became

17

final, and you ask whether precedent compelled the

18

result that a later decision reached.

19
20
21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

Have we applied -- have

we applied Teague to Federal convictions before?
MR. DREEBEN:

This Court has not, except in

22

the sense that in Bousley v. United States, the Court

23

ran through a Teague analysis before holding that a

24

substantive interpretation of a Federal statute is not

25

captured by Teague.

So, in that sense, the Court has
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

presumed the applicability, but it hasn't squarely held

2

it.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

And at least one important basis for the

5

Teague rule is the comity to the state court system,

6

which you don't have when the underlying conviction is a

7

Federal conviction.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

It hasn't.

True, Justice Ginsburg, but

this Court has also recognized that Federal courts have

10

an interest in the finality of Federal convictions

11

that's every bit as strong as state courts.

12

And so, for example, in

13

United States v. Frady, the Court applied the procedural

14

default rule exactly the same as it applies in state

15

cases to Federal 2255 proceedings.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the second part of my

17

question that you were about to answer was whether or

18

not it's dictated by precedent, and in this case, it was

19

not dictated by precedent because it applied to

20

collateral consequences; or, what's the because?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, there are two becauses.

22

One is no court had held, as this Court did in Padilla,

23

that deportation, though not administered by the

24

sentencing court, was so intimately tied to the criminal

25

case that the direct collateral distinction was not

3

There was no precedent that

in Sixth Amendment law.

at the Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, Padilla

6

did not claim that any decision was controlling of its

7

holding.

8
9

And then when you actually look

The closest case was the Hill case,
Hill v. Lockhart, and in that case the Court approached

10

a collateral consequence, namely, parole eligibility

dates, and it said:

on whether parole eligibility dates can be the subject

of a Strickland claim, because Hill had failed to show

issue whether a consequence that's not administered by

answering the following:

Normally a new rule that this

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

In the case of

3

inadequate assistance of counsel, without being picky,

4

the place where that claim is best developed, in my view

5

is first collateral, because for reasons we both

6

understand.

7

large it is, and I think should be, developed in that

8

way, why not treat in the case of an inadequate

9

assistance claim the first collateral as in other claims

All right.

10

you treat direct review?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

So given the fact that by and

Justice Breyer, let me give

12

you a merits answer to that question, and then an answer

13

on why I do not think Petitioner has fairly preserved or

14

presented that issue to this Court.

15

The merits answer is that Teague reflects a

16

fundamental judgment that when a case is final on its

17

direct review, society has a strong interest in

18

protecting that judgment.

19

when the state or the Federal government has not

20

conformed to existing constitutional law.

21

And the exception to that is

Now, bringing that down to earth for

22

ineffective assistance claims, at the time that Ms.

23

Chaidez's conviction became final, and all convictions

24

that became final before Padilla, jurisdictions had no

25

reason to think that they needed to protect against the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possibility that a criminal defense lawyer would not

2

have advised about deportation, because the unanimous

3

view was that's not something that's the Sixth Amendment

4

duty.

5

Immediately after Padilla came down

6

reflecting that it was, the Criminal Rules Committee

7

began considering an amendment to Rule 11, which is now

8

pending before the Judicial Conference, that would

9

require judges to advise defendants about the

10

possibility of deportation consequences.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In other

It was -- it was approved

by the Judicial Conference in September.
MR. DREEBEN:

I will accept that, if that's

correct, Justice Ginsburg.
The point is that as soon as Padilla made it

17

clear that a constitutional rule about defense counsel

18

could threaten the finality of guilty pleas, the Rules

19

Committee has taken steps to protect the integrity of

20

federal judgments through a Rule 11 amendment.

21

no opportunity or reason to do that -- I can't say no

22

opportunity, but it had no reason to do that as a

23

constitutional matter until the Court decided Padilla.

24

And so there is a logical relationship between --

JUSTICE BREYER:

It had

You could say that, you

2

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so all those -- those

15

are the -- when you look at the functional factors, it

16

looks quite similar to me and I'm trying to --

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that it's quite

18

identical, Justice Breyer, but there are additional

19

considerations that are at stake here, too.

20

all, Massaro, which Mr. Fisher relies on, doesn't

21

preclude a defendant from raising a claim on direct

22

review.

23

he does not do that.

direct review, but he also will not be in great shape to

First of

It says that it's not a procedural default if
A criminal defendant will probably

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

raise it on collateral review.

2

Unless this Court alters its Sixth Amendment

3

holdings, such a defendant will be pro se, they will not

4

have a lawyer, they will be pretty much in the same fix

5

that they are in on direct review.

6

Now, if this Court announces that new rules

7

under Strickland are not going to be applied to

8

defendants whose convictions became final, then those

9

defendants who want to raise a new rule claim are on

10

notice that they'll need to do it on direct review.

11

Courts of appeals will be on notice that if someone

12

raises such a claim, the appropriate thing to do is to

13

adjudicate it or remand for its adjudication.

Now, right now the D.C.

I think Massaro

But you have to understand how rare a

10

new rule under Strickland really is, the way that the

11

Court has administered Strickland to date.

12

Applications of the existing Strickland

13

standard to particular sets of facts are not new rules.

14

That's why in the 28 years since Strickland none of this

15

Court's decisions, and there are about 30 of them, under

16

Strickland added up to a new rule.

17

because it answered the question, not how does

18

Strickland apply, but whether it applies at all to

19

something outside the compass of the sentencing court.

Padilla broke ground

And so in that respect, there's no reason

20
21

why the standard practice under Massaro should change if

22

this Court were to address the issue and make clearer

23

that new rules are not going to be applied on collateral

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dreeben, if

Justice Breyer were right, that there should be sort of

one run -- run up the flagpole and that Teague doesn't

review of IAC claims, if that's right, what are the

costs of that?

limitations for bringing a collateral claim or is it

something more than that?

9

Is that an extra year to the statute of

MR. DREEBEN:

It could be something more

10

than that, because if the Court announces a new rule and

11

makes it retroactive to a case on collateral review,

12

(f)(3) of the statute of limitations provision gives the

13

defendant another 1 year.

benefit of that rule, because Ms. Chaidez was on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Although you said you

17

recognize that we have not had a Teague case involving a

18

Federal conviction, I mean, there is lots of language in

19

Teague cases about the Federal courts not interfering

20

with state courts, that Teague was intended to minimize

21

Federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings, to

22

limit the authority of the Federal courts to overturn

23

state convictions.

24

that -- that basis.

If I could give one more reason why I think

7

the Court should refrain from entertaining that

8

Massaro-based analogy here, the Court has just begun to

9

embark in the Martinez v. Ryan line of cases on trying

10

to figure out how ineffectiveness claims should be

11

handled on collateral review.

12

It grants its certiorari on Monday in

13

Trevino v. Thaler, where it's going to explore how does

14

Martinez apply in a jurisdiction that may be more like

15

the Federal system in that ineffective assistance of

16

counsel claims aren't channeled only to direct review,

17

they can be asserted on direct -- I'm sorry -- only to

18

collateral review, they can be asserted on direct

19

review.

review, but not as a matter of law.

21

They are channeled largely to collateral

So the Court has a lot of work to do in

22

figuring out what that decision means.

23

rather than embark on a brand new process of applying

24

that kind of reasoning in a case where it was never

25

raised below, where the government never really had the
54

opportunity to counter any of those arguments, and the

3

it's not a wise use of the Court's resources.

4

Instead, resolving the new rule question

5

that has divided the circuits would provide an answer

6

for us and the 28 states that filed an amicus brief that

7

supported the United States on the new rule question,

8

and would result, I think, appropriately, in concluding

that Padilla was a new rule, unique among this Court's

Thank you.

The first is, picking up where Mr. Dreeben

19

left off, I'm not asking for any anything that is

20

difficult.

21

Mr. Dreeben referred to the Frady case,

22

where this Court held that there is enough of an

23

interest in finality to have procedural default apply to

24

25

Court carved out IAC claims.

Yet, in Massaro, this

55
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Exactly the same analysis applies here, and

2

I do think the Court really ought to answer that

3

question in this case because, if you hold that Padilla

4

is a new rule and that Teague now applies to IAC claims,

5

rest assured the Federal courthouses are going to be

6

flooded, flooded with Federal -- with Federal defenders

7

and other criminal lawyers raising IAC claims on direct

8

review.

could do, because if you say Teague applies on -- if you

There'd be nothing else a responsible lawyer

10

wait until collateral review, but it doesn't apply on

his client has to bring it on direct review.

13

to absolutely change the way criminal procedure and

14

criminal appellate procedure happens in the Federal

15

court system.

16

It's going

The second point I wanted to make is back to

17

the new rule question.

18

that the lower courts that had said that misadvice about

19

deportation consequences violated Strickland had said

20

something that was within Strickland that didn't

21

constitute a new rule.

broke new ground, if he's correct, by saying deportation

advice falls within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment in

and omissions.

3

Strickland that this Court rejected.

4

And that's exactly the distinction in

And in Padilla itself, this Court used the

5

word absurd.

And I think, Justice Kennedy, when you

6

mentioned commonsense, I think we could throw that in,

7

too.

8

And so to the extent that the argument, at

9

the end of the day when everything's stripped away, is

10

that the lower courts were reasonable in saying that

11

failing to advise about the most important thing a

12

client would have been thinking as to whether to plead

13

guilty is not ineffective assistance of counsel, whereas

14

giving bad advice is, that's a line that Strickland

15

itself rejected, that Flores-Ortega rejected when it

16

came to the right to appeal and whether the lawyer ought

17

to give advice; and, it's a line that this Court in

18

Padilla had no difficulty whatsoever rejecting and

19

called it absurd.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

back to one of your points?

22

it is important.

Your red light is on, but

The floodgate issue.

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Mr. Fisher, can I go

Yes.
I'm not sure about the

floodgates for the following reason.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Once we announce

Official

1

Padilla, any pending direct claim and any pending

2

collateral claim that arises after Padilla for something

3

that happened after Padilla would be covered by the

4

rule, so there'd be no bar to those claims.

5

floodgate is temporary, if there is --

6
7

MR. FISHER:

No, it's not,

Justice Sotomayor.

8
9

So the

The issue arises because Teague ordinarily
comes into play when somebody asks the Court to create a

10

new rule and apply it to him.

So all the hypotheticals

11

we've talked about today, about would Strickland apply

12

here, would Strickland apply there, to parole advice, to

13

professional license, all of those claims would be

14

asking, if the government's correct, for a new rule.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. FISHER:

17

And so all of those claims

would have to be brought.

18

Thank you.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21
22

Thank you, counsel.

The case is

submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
