CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Goldstein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
very much.

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you

May it please the Court:
Today's undercard is an immigration case.

10
11

Adrian Moncrieffe was convicted of possession with

12

intent to distribute marijuana, under Georgia law, the

13

question in the case is whether he was thereby convicted

14

of a controlled substances offense, which is a

15

deportable offense, but also an aggravated felony of

16

illicit trafficking in drugs, which would mean that the

17

Attorney General has no discretion to cancel his

18

removal.

19

Now, everyone agrees that, under the Georgia

20

statute, there is going to be some conduct that would be

21

a Federal felony, but it's also undisputed that the

22

Georgia statute regularly involves prosecutions that

23

would be Federal misdemeanors.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

word, "regularly."

So -Excuse me.

You use that

Do you have statistics on that?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Were they provided in the briefs?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

we attempted very hard to collect them.

4

information I can give you about Federal and State

5

prosecutions of marijuana cases in the United States.

6

They were not.

We do not --

This is the

In the State system, the most recent

7

available data -- it was published by the Department of

8

Justice in 2006, but we have no reason to believe that

9

it's changed materially -- in 2006, there were roughly

10

750,000 prosecutions in the States for marijuana

11

offenses.

12

By contrast, in the Federal system, we have

13

data from 2010.

14

here that's a little bit more granular, and that is, for

15

prosecutions under 841(b)(1), which is the trafficking

16

provision, there were 6,200 cases.

17

And we have two different kinds of data

For prosecutions under 841(b)(4) -- which is

18

the provision we say you ought to look at here -- and

19

844 -- which is the possession provision -- combined,

20

there were only 93 prosecutions in 2010.

21

And what we think that illustrates is that

22

there is a massive amount of activity in the States

23

doing things that show that this -- and this case is

24

perfectly commonplace, we think.

25

the other cases that we've seen published by the BIA.

It's consistent with

Adrian Moncrieffe possessed --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's -- it's a massive

3

amount of conduct that -- that the statute contemplates?

4

The statutory scheme -- I just didn't hear.

5

didn't hear.

6
7

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.

I just

I apologize.

Yes,

Justice Kennedy, that's right.
The Georgia statute, which just refers to
possession with intent to distribute, contemplates both

10

social sharing of marijuana -- this case, for example,

11

1.3 grams of marijuana, which is less than --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you -- now, Mr.

13

Goldstein, when you say, "this case," is there any proof

14

in the record that there was a small amount and no -- no

15

remuneration?

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg,

17

although this is -- we believe the case is proceeding

18

under the categorical approach, the answer to your

19

question is yes.

20

So let me take you to two places.

One is

21

going to be at the back of the blue brief, where we have

22

the chemist's report, so page 19.

23

the record in the immigration proceedings.

24
25

This is from the --

And on page 19 of the appendix to our blue
brief -- we just agreed because there was so little
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

record material, that we wouldn't have a joint appendix

2

in the case.

3

brief -- it says, "Material weight less than 1 ounce.

4

Approximate weight is 1.3 grams."

5

We just published it at the end of our

And for those of us who've been fortunate

6

enough not to experience the drug laws a lot, that's

7

less than half the weight of this penny.

8

think everybody agrees, a small amount.

9
10

Now, on the question of no remuneration,
what I have to offer you is the Georgia statute --

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So it's -- I

Yes.
-- parentheses,

"Approximate weight is 1" -- 1 -- oh, I see, 1.3 grams.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.

1.3 grams.

1.3.

That's -- that's very, very, very, very little.
So then, on the question of remuneration --

22

and I should just step back and explain, the reason

23

we're talking about this is that the Federal misdemeanor

24

provision, 841(b)(4), says that it's not a felony, and

25

thus, it wouldn't be an aggravated felony, if it's a
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

small amount and no remuneration.

2

asked about the -- what's in the record about that.

3

And Justice Ginsburg

Now, there isn't record evidence about no

4

remuneration, but there is one significant fact.

5

know that fact, you have to look at the Georgia statute,

6

which is also at the end of our brief.

7

of our appendix.

8
9

And to

It's on page 9

This is the statute he was prosecuted under.
It's the second provision, Section 16-13-30(j)(1).

And

10

I'll just read it.

"It is unlawful for any person to

11

possess, have under his control, manufacture, deliver,

12

distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell" --

13

sell -- "or possess with intent to distribute

14

marijuana."
And he was not charged with and he was not

15
16

convicted of selling.

17

negative any indication -- any implication that he might

18

have gotten remuneration for this.

19

And so we think that should

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You -- we are discussing

20

the categorical approach, but let's assume he had pled

21

guilty.

22

smaller amount or to remuneration.

23

immigration judge, under the argument you're making

24

today, have to ignore that allocution?

25

able to apply the modified approach and find this

And in his allocution, he had admitted to not a

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Would -- would an

Or would he be

Official

1

gentleman an aggravated felon?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Under our rule, the plea

3

colloquy is irrelevant, but we would win under a rule in

4

which it was relevant.

5

So, to start with the former, we say that

6

the categorical rule applies.

There's no -- the only

7

reason that you would look at the modified categorical

8

approach here is to know that it was a possession with

9

intent to distribute conviction, rather than a sale

10

conviction, but that evidence would still come in.

It

11

would be highly relevant.

12

Court explained in Carachuri-Rosendo, that the

13

immigration judge would deny cancellation of removal.

14

Right?

It's the basis that this

That factor would still be highly relevant.

15
16

The Attorney General would exercise his discretion in

17

such a case.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

-- either way.

So -- you know, lawyers

6

often try and avoid the strength of the other side's

7

case.

8

argument of theirs.

And so let me just confront what I think is a big

9

They say our position is underinclusive

10

because the Georgia statute does include conduct that

11

would be a felony.

12

You just gave an example of it.

But our point is that our underinclusivity

13

is a problem, but it's not a big problem, it's not as

14

big as their problem, because, as this Court explained

15

in Carachuri-Rosendo, the offense still is removable,

16

and the Attorney General will just deny cancellation of

17

removal.

18

Now, the reason they have a much bigger

19

practical problem is that their rule is overinclusive.

20

It treats, as felonies, some convictions that should be

21

misdemeanors.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I see that.

There's

23

something I really don't understand in these cases

24

because the other cases, our precedent's been around a

25

long time, so I would have guessed that, under that
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

precedent in these other statutes, the obvious thing to

2

do -- the obvious puzzle here is not the Federal

3

statute, it's the State statute, what is this thing he

4

was convicted of about?

5

So you'd pick up the phone, and you'd phone,

6

at random, four U.S. attorneys -- not U.S. attorneys,

7

but four State attorneys --

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- who work with the

10

statute in Georgia, and say, now, look, the indictment

11

here says possession with intent to distribute, and I

12

can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount.

13

Now, is it your policy, if he was selling it, to charge

14

under the sell?

15

it to charge under intent to distribute?

16

random whether you say sell or intent to distribute?

17

What's your policy?

18

Is it your policy if he's not selling
Is it totally

Okay?

Then we get some answers.

Then we'd have an

19

idea whether what you're saying is right.

Now, you

20

could do that, but they could do it, too.

Anyone could

21

do it.

22

whether this charge -- really, it corresponds to the

23

misdemeanor or the felony in the Federal statute.

24
25

And then we'd have some actual facts about

So why -- I'm not -- I mean, that isn't a
brain -- that isn't -- doesn't require -- it's not
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rocket science, okay?

2

So why has no one done it?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because I don't think

3

anybody would believe me if I went to an immigration

4

judge and I said, judge, I promise, I promise that the

5

fact that this isn't a possession with intent to

6

distribute case means that there are never cases in --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

"never."

9

State statute?

You don't have to say,

The question is what kind of a statute is this

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

We -- I think --

And the kind of statute

12

that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute

13

people --

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

Yes.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

If your version of what

that felon intends to distribute --

20

22

-- with small amounts when

they don't sell.

17

19

Yes.

Yes.
The distinction there is

really picked up by the district attorneys.
And if it's not, then they may be right,

24

because -- because then intent to distribute may well

25

often include, as it does under Federal law, people who
11

sell stuff.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We have not read this

Court's cases to suggest that we call the State

attorneys.

5

ordinary statutory construction, and sell means sell --

7

We have read the Court's cases to engage in

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Okay.

You didn't.

In any words, nobody did it.

8

So my other question --

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

-- which is the only other

11

one I really have, aside from making that suggestion.

12

But here, what happened to this person?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

Yes.
He was -- was he sentenced

That is, was he sentenced to

Which would be evidence in your favor, I

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But was he, or wasn't he?
Yes.
All right.

If he was, what

22

it says in this provision is that the Court may without

23

24

of guilt.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So there was no judgment

Yes.
12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it says, if he

2

completes it, he then is discharged without court

3

adjudication of guilt.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Yes.
And -- and shall not be

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.
Well, why are we saying he

Sure.

Because the

11

government's position is -- and the Eleventh Circuit has

12

agreed with it -- and just to -- just to make sure

13

everyone is on the same page, and that is, the Federal

14

statute is triggered by a conviction.

15

Justice Breyer has just made the point that,

16

as a matter of State law, he was not even convicted

17

because he got first offender treatment here, which is a

18

point in our favor.

19

and non-serious offense.

20

It does show that it was a small

The reason is that there is a Federal

21

definition of convicted that's independent of the State

22

definition of convicted.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that question's

not before us today.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's exactly right.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Well, isn't

2

the reason we don't look at the particular facts and

3

particular case and don't depose four district

4

attorneys, is that the Court has adopted a categorical

5

approach precisely to avoid that type of inquiry in --

6

whatever it is, 750,000 cases?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

That's correct.

And

8

it's an even stronger point in our favor because worse

9

than interviewing four district attorneys is having a

10

fact-bound inquiry into every one of these immigration

11

cases.

Remember --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I'm sorry.

13

We don't need that because we've adopted a categorical

14

approach.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

Yeah.
841(b)(1)(D) lists

the elements and conviction in -- Georgia, right?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Conviction in

20

Georgia under their provision satisfies -- has each of

21

those elements.

22

that's the end of the inquiry.

23

And under our categorical approach,

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is one way of looking

24

at it.

We disagree, for reasons I'll explain.

25

note in our favor that the Attorney General doesn't even
14
Alderson Reporting Company

I will

defend that position anymore.

2

Remember, that they do not argue that you

can just look at the conviction.

fact-bound inquiry into every one of these cases.

5

the reason is that, if you apply the categorical

6

approach to --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

position.

In every case at the

So I'll -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So let me --

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Before you get on --

Official

1

I didn't understand that to be their position at all.

2

mean, I suppose we -- I certainly will ask them because

3

they're probably better able to articulate their

4

position, but --

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

6

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I

So let me explain.
Go ahead.

So our position is it is a

8

controlled substances offense, and you take account of

9

the seriousness of the offense in cancellation.

Their

10

position is that it is presumptively, but only

11

presumptively, an aggravated felony.

12

single immigration proceeding, when you have a case like

13

this, the noncitizen can come forward with fact-found

14

evidence, not limited to the record of conviction -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

And in every

Mr. Goldstein, it's

17

which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes

18

that like an affirmative defense.

defendant to show those two things, to get out from

20

under the main statute.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The burden is on the

That's correct.
So what the Government is

23

suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can

24

get.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, let me just say first,
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I do want to make -- just want to focus on what the

2

parties' positions are.

3

fact-found inquiry in every one, so I do want to turn to

4

what I think is probably their second best argument.

5

was talking about the underinclusiveness as the first

6

one.

7

And they do have this

I

Their second one is they want to draw an

8

analogy between this and what would happen in a criminal

9

case.

So they say, take the conviction and imagine that

10

the conviction is all the facts that you had in a

11

Federal criminal prosecution, and then you would have a

12

burden on the defendant to -- to prove that he was

13

subject to the misdemeanor.

14

We have several points about that.

The

15

first is this is not a Federal criminal prosecution.

16

The Federal statute involved is the Immigration and

17

Naturalization Act, and it tells you that you are

18

supposed to look at the conviction itself and determine

19

whether it corresponds to a Federal felony.

20

This further proceeding doesn't exist, and

21

it's exactly the argument that was rejected in

22

Carachuri-Rosendo.

23

And let me talk about why --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said Carachuri.

That

24

case involved, in -- in order to hold for the

25

government, you would have to go outside the record of
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the State conviction.

2

wasn't in the State conviction.

3

You'd have to add something that

And it's the same thing here.

To get to

4

where you want to go, you have to add something that

5

isn't in the State conviction.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, we disagree.

What the

7

Court said in -- I agree with the beginning of how you

8

characterize the Carachuri case.

9

we don't go beyond the -- the conviction itself.

What the Court said is

We -- And it's true that, in that case, the

10
11

government wanted to go beyond the record to go up.

12

here, what they're saying is that you should go beyond

13

the record to figure out if you should go down.

14

what the Court said is, no, you look at the conviction

15

itself.

What -- what is the

conviction?

What does the conviction

You say the categorical approach.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

22

24

seem to be saying, the indictment?

would be a Federal felony.

5

strength of that point.

6

So here, he was convicted of possession with intent
The other side's argument is, well, if I

So we acknowledge the

But our --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is he convicted of that?

7

Or is he convicted of violating Georgia Code 16-13,

8

whatever it is?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

As I was -- I mentioned very

10

briefly to Justice Sotomayor, when you have a divisible

11

statute like this, that includes possession with intent

12

to distribute, sell, possess, all of those things, you

13

use the modified categorical approach to figure out

14

which one applies.

15

And so we know he was convicted of

16

possession with intent to distribute, and that's common

17

ground between the parties.

18

It's just the --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's not the whole statute.

Well, Mr. Goldstein,

20

assuming he was convicted of that, as you suggest, you

21

have an underinclusiveness problem.

22

an overinclusiveness problem.

The Government has

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you assume that this

statute covers and is regularly used to cover both sets

of people, both people with these very minor offenses

2

and people with much more major offenses --

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- the at least apparent

5

attractiveness of the government's position is that

6

they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem.

7

And they have done it by sticking on -- and -- you know,

8

one can ask where this comes from in the statute --

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I hope we will.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- but they have done it by

11

sticking on something that attempts to address their

12

overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really

13

misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and

14

people who are really aggravated felons get classified

15

that way.

16

And you have no similar cure for your

17

underinclusiveness problem.

18

their problem, which at least attempts to solve this

19

problem?

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So why shouldn't we go with

Well, two reasons.

First,

21

they don't have a real solution; and, second, Congress

22

solved our problem.

23

And this is what Carachuri-Rosendo says, and

24

that is when you have an underinclusiveness problem just

25

like ours, the statute fixes it because the statute

treats the conviction as a controlled substances

2

offense.

3

have to make one up, which, I -- I suggest to you, is

4

the difficulty with their position.

The statute provides the backstop.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You don't

I don't follow --

Okay.
-- your answer because I

8

think you have to concede that, under your view, a lot

9

of people who are convicted under the Georgia statute

10

who had a significant quantity, which they intended to

11

distribute --

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- for remuneration --

Yes.
-- many of those people

16

would -- under your view of the statute, many of those

17

people would -- would not have committed an aggravated

18

felony.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I agree with -So you have that --

That is our problem.

I

agree with that problem.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- a large

underinclusiveness problem, which you haven't solved.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

That's the part we

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disagree with, Justice Ginsburg.

2

to you what this Court said about this exact issue in

3

Carachuri-Rosendo.

4

Maybe I can just read

It said that, when you have a very -- this

5

very underinclusiveness problem, it is solved by the

6

statute because the attorney -- all that happens under

7

our rule -- it's still a deportable offense, and the

8

Attorney General denies cancellation of removal.

9

So if could just read, very briefly -- and

10

this is from the Supreme Court Reporter, at page 2589.

11

"We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an

12

aggravated felony is relevant, inter alia, to the type

13

of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to

14

whether he is, in fact, removable.
"In other words, to the extent that our

15
16

rejection of the government's broad understanding of the

17

scope of aggravated felony may have any practical effect

18

on policing our Nation's borders, it is a limited one.

19

Carachuri-Rosendo and others in his position may now

20

seek cancellation of removal and thereby avoid the harsh

21

consequence of mandatory removal, but he will not avoid

22

the fact that his conviction makes him" --

23

But all that follows

3

No, Justice Ginsburg, it

I promise you it does not.
The upshot of our position is that

4

Mr. Moncrieffe has committed a controlled substances

5

offense, and anyone else in his position has committed

6

one.

7

Attorney General will deny him cancellation of removal.

8

I have --

9

And if there is a serious drug amount, the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think that the

10

Attorney General could just issue some kind of directive

11

telling all administrative law judges and officials to

12

deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commits

13

these kinds of offenses?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We -- it's an interesting

15

question that I have puzzled about at length.

16

the answer is no for a very particular reason, however,

17

and that is the Attorney General has no such categorical

18

rules.

19

I think

We think it's a point in our favor that the

20

Attorney General, in the application starting with

21

212(c) before the 1996 Act, which is discussed in St. --

22

this Court's decision in St. Cyr, through the present

23

has instead applied a holistic look at all of the

24

circumstances.

25

What he certainly can do is direct the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

immigration judges to place special weight -- and this

2

was the rule before 1996, by the way.

3

serious offense, you had to show special equities that

4

would justify your not being removed from the country.

5

And so we think that's the most likely outcome.

6

If you had a

A per se categorical rule would be very

7

unlike what we understand the Attorney General to do in

8

any other circumstance.

there would be a substantial argument that it would be

22

question, and it's not presented here.

23

But it's an open

I had said that there were two flaws in

24

the -- sort of their characterization of the over and

25

underinclusiveness problem.

The second one is they

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't have a real solution.

This is a big problem.

2

Under these State convictions in which the

3

amount of drugs and whether there was remuneration are

4

irrelevant, it's going to be extremely difficult for

5

uncounseled noncitizens who are in jail, who don't have

6

access to tools of communication, to prove to an

7

immigration judge this fact-bound inquiry, which they

8

are inserting into every single case, that their offense

9

actually corresponds to a misdemeanor.
So while you say that they have provided the

10
11

solution, I don't know where it comes from in the

12

statute, but we think it is not a practical solution.

13

And that problem is even worse in the many contexts that

14

are not just straight removal.
We said in our opening brief, and the

15
16

government's response ignores, that there are many cases

17

in which immigration officials have to make these

18

decisions about whether it's an aggravated felony much

19

more on the fly, without the opportunity to call

20

everybody in and --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you have any

22

statistics -- if you take the whole universe of

23

convictions under the Georgia statute, what percentage

24

of them are for these minor offenses and what are for

25

the major?

Do we have any handle on that at all?
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We don't.

We were unable to do it.

We tried.

I'm

sorry.

3

Justice has better relationships with prosecutors, and

4

so maybe it -- it will have that information for you.

5

But, I can say -- it's possible.

The Department of

But I can say that the -- it is absolutely

7

commonplace, from looking at the case law, for the

8

States to tackle this small social sharing of a couple

9

of marijuana cigarettes.

This is -- that's the

10

distinction between 93 prosecutions under -- or

11

convictions under (b)(4) and possession in the -- in the

12

Federal system and 750,000 in the States.

13

prosecutors leave these to the States.

14

Federal

Which brings me back to my other answer to

15

Justice Ginsburg's pointing out the government's

16

argument about a parallel between this and a Federal

17

criminal prosecution.

18

And the reason they want to do that, Justice

19

Ginsburg, is that in a Federal -- actual Federal

20

criminal prosecution, the burden of proof never matters,

21

including because Federal prosecutors almost never bring

22

these cases.

23

So here's what we tried to do:

This

24

statute, (b)(4), was enacted in 1970, some 42 years ago.

25

We tried to identify one case in 42 years in which the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

burden of proof in the Federal case made any difference

2

at all, and we were unable to.

3

interested to know if my friend is able to identify one

4

case in 42 years, which it actually made a difference.

5

And I would be really

And the reason is, in an actual Federal

6

prosecution, the FBI agent would come in and say, here

7

are the drugs, and they were trying to sell it to an

8

undercover officer.

9

actually -- the defendant is in a position of trying to

10
11

It's never the case that it

prove that it was a misdemeanor.
But what they are trying to do is to take

12

that rule, which is derived from Apprendi, that there is

13

a burden of proof so that the government doesn't have to

14

indict that it wasn't a (b)(4) offense, and take the

15

silence of the State record, where these facts are

16

completely irrelevant, the quantity and remuneration,

17

and transpose them into the Federal system and take

18

great advantage of the fact that the record is silent.

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sure.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume Georgia has

3

the Federal statute, but in -- differently than the

4

Federal statute, it has a sale-distribution provision,

5

and it has a small amount, no remuneration statute.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Yeah.
What would happen in

those States?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There are about 15 of those

10

States, and in those States, if you weren't convicted

11

under the small one, then you would infer it wasn't a

12

small amount and no remuneration, and the person would

13

have committed an aggravated felony.

14

Our issue arises only when you have a

15

situation in which the State is prosecuting people under

16

the statute that would be a Federal misdemeanor.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If the State has a

different system, as a material number of States do, in

22

which they track the Federal system, and they have a

23

small provision or a remuneration provision -- which

24

another nine States have a remuneration provision -- in

25

those situations, if you have a conviction that isn't
29
Alderson Reporting Company

under that social sharing provision, it's an aggravated

2

felony.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your use of the

States are prosecuting every case that comes before them

6

because that's how you get -- you know, of these 750,000

7

nationwide, so much more than must involve tiny amounts.

8

But, of course, perhaps they don't prosecute

9

the cases involving tiny amounts, so that most of those

10

cases, or some percentage of them, may in fact also

11

involve the serious type of conduct addressed by the

12

Federal statute.

And we don't deny that there are --

17

Mr. Chief Justice, please do not misunderstand me to be

18

arguing that every Georgia conviction or that 80 or

19

90 percent of them are the small ones.

20

to tell you is that a lot of them are just like this

21

one, and I think the data bears that out.

22

What I'm trying

And the question before you is, under a

23

all felonies?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

amount.

in which a -- the convicted individual is proven to have

sold the larger amount?

to cancel?

25

MR. SHAH:

You still think they are going

What -- Your Honor, what Congress
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said when it passed this very provision was that

2

immigration judges were granting too much discretionary

3

relief to this very class of criminal aliens, and that

4

is why it implemented this aggravated felony.

5

Now, Petitioner says it's not going to have

6

a big deal on immigration -- big impact on immigration

7

policy for the reason that you suggest, the Attorney

8

General can do it at the back end.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that -Well, will you pause

10

right there.

I don't -- you just made the argument that

11

your position on Castro-Rodriguez is wrong.

12

Congress took away the Attorney General's discretion.

13

Then you come back and say, well, we're going to

14

exercise that discretion under -- under

15

Castro-Rodriguez, and this Petitioner in particular can

16

take advantage of it.

exercise of discretion under Castro-Rodriguez.

20

CSA scheme.

We, at

Remember that this aggravated felony

22

provision in the INA incorporates by reference the CSA

23

scheme.

25

distribute marijuana will be a felony.

What the CSA scheme provides is, as a default

33
Alderson Reporting Company

But the CSA

Official

1

scheme also provides a narrow mitigating exception for

2

those who distribute just a small amount socially.

3

What our scheme does is that --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

authority for that Castro-Rodriguez?

6

MR. SHAH:

Is the authority for

Is that -- is the

MR. SHAH:

To -- to have that secondary

proceeding?

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. SHAH:

Right.

Well, I think it comes from the

13

statute, the INA, which incorporates the CSA scheme.

14

Because many of the State provisions don't offer that

15

same affirmative mitigating exception that the Federal

16

scheme does, what Castro-Rodriguez does is it looks to

17

the INA, which incorporates the CSA, and then provides a

18

similar mechanism in immigration court.

19

But it's not an unprecedented inquiry.

The

20

Board has been doing similar inquiries for at least a

21

quarter of a century.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Shah, the Board

23

may have been doing these inquiries, but I just don't

24

understand the statutory argument because the way the

25

statute -- the way your own statutory argument runs is
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that if the conviction -- the State conviction, was a

2

conviction for possession with intent to distribute,

3

then those are the elements of a Federal -- of a Federal

4

felony.

5

And so the person -- and an aggravated

6

felony.

7

person has committed an aggravated felony.

8

statutory directive is that, when a person has committed

9

an aggravated, felony, he is deportable, and there is no

10

So you say, under the elements approach, this
And the

exercise of discretion that can come into play.

11

And so your whole back-end process, which

12

says, oh, well, maybe not, maybe he's not automatically

13

deportable, it doesn't come from the statute, and it

14

seems to run into the statutory language, which says an

15

aggravated felon must be deported, the end.

16

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, I agree.

The

17

government could have taken the hard-line approach that

18

it's game over under the categorical inquiry because the

19

elements --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's what the

21

statute says, and that's what your own statutory

22

analysis says.

23

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, I don't think it's

24

inconsistent with the statutory scheme.

25

think it's consistent.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

In fact, I

Official

1

And here's one way to think about it:

2

This -- this particular aggravated felony is a little

3

bit complicated because it incorporates by reference, in

4

two different levels, the CSA.

5

Congress rewrote the aggravated felony definition to

6

eliminate the incorporation by reference.

7

Congress -- let's assume

I think what the equivalent -- the

8

functionally identical formulation would be -- the

9

definition of the aggravated felony is, "any

10

distribution of a controlled substance, unless the

11

defendant shows that it involved a small amount of

12

marijuana for no remuneration."

13

That would incorporate both the presumptive

14

felony provision, any distribution of controlled

15

substance -- you have the same two elements -- and then

16

it would add in the proviso that it's in the CSA

17

mitigating exception.

Functionally identical.

18

Aggravated felony is, "any distribution of a

19

controlled substance, unless the defendant shows that it

20

was a small quantity for remuneration."

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. SHAH:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

This is --

What our inquiry does is -Go ahead.

I'm

sorry.
MR. SHAH:

Sorry.

What our inquiry does is

36
Alderson Reporting Company

allow the board to get to that second part of the

2

definition, the "unless" clause, and that mirrors

3

exactly other aggravated felony provisions in the INA.

own interpretation of this statute require the opposite

7

result and -- or the -- the harsh result?

8

10

And you say, well, suppose Congress wrote a
statute this way.

But that wasn't her question.

The

question is --

11

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, I'm not positing --

12

You -- you said that

13

Congress could write a new statute.

14

could write a new statute, but what about this one?

15

MR. SHAH:

Of course, Congress

I'm not positing a new statute.

16

I was simply taking out the incorporation by reference,

17

so we could look at it in a different way.

18

functionally identical to the provision at issue here.

19

And I think it's --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think it's

No, I'll just read you,

21

Mr. Shah, this sentence from your brief -- and I could

22

read you a thousand of these in your brief.

Petitioner's Georgia conviction necessarily established

that he knowingly possessed marijuana with the specific

25

intent to distribute it, that conviction constitutes an
37
Alderson Reporting Company

"Because

Official

1

aggravated felony."

2

Well, if that conviction constitutes an

3

aggravated felony, he has to be deported, and there is

4

no exercise of discretion that this statute allows.

you say this 10 or 15 times.

13

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, the heading to

14

the brief says, "presumptively," and so I didn't use

15

that word every time, but I think the point is that it

16

would be the -- the aggravated felony has that unless

17

clause.

18

And if you look at other aggravated felony

19

provisions in the INA, such as the one reproduced on the

20

top of page 34 of the government's brief, it defines an

21

aggravated felony as certain document fraud crimes, and

22

then it has a clause that says, "unless" -- "unless the

23

alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed

24

the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting or,

25

abating only the alien's spouse, child, or parent to
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

violate a provision of the INA."

2

So you could say ball game over, once you

3

have shown the document fraud crime under the

4

categorical approach.

5

provision that says, unless the alien can show that he

6

committed the offense for the purpose of assisting and

7

abetting --

But the INA specifically has a

My understanding

10

is that you -- your clients were on the other side of

11

this position in Castro-Rodriguez itself; is that not

12

correct?

13

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

14

that we categorically deny that you could have this sort

15

of proceeding.

16

Petitioner says this is a new position in this case.

18

as the right way to do it.

And in the op to this case -- I know

I think it's --

25

that sort of inquiry is not new.

I can't say that they categorically

If you look at the Grijalva decision, which

2

is discussed on -- in footnote 23 of our brief on page

3

36, that was a precursor to the controlled substance

4

ground of removability that is currently in effect.

5

so if you look at the language of that precursor

6

provision, essentially, it said any aliens deportable

7

for a drug offense, unless that drug offense involves

8

simple possession of marijuana of 30 grams or less.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So what does -- in a

10

case in which the Attorney General can cancel removal,

11

putting aside this case, what are the sort of things he

12

looks at in deciding whether or not to cancel removal?

13

MR. SHAH:

It's a balance of equities.

14

After, assuming that the -- the alien has established

15

the three eligibility criteria set forth, it will be a

16

balance.

17

a balance of the equities.

18

It's a favorable exercise of discretion.

19

things, presumably, is the amount of drugs involved,

There have

My colleague combines 844(a), which is a

possession offense, but if you isolate out of the data

4

only those who qualify for the mitigating exception,

5

those who are charged with distribution of marijuana,

6

but only have a small amount of remuneration, you have

7

20 out of over 60,000.

8

I think this is a fairly atypical case.

the extent this Petitioner --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do -- do you agree with

MR. SHAH:

Uh-huh.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where we said that, in

22

talking about the generic Federal offense, whether it's

23

a felony or not, that we can't look at just strictly the

24

elements of the crime, but we have to also look at the

25

sentencing factors because, when we're talking about
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal

2

law, we have to look at both.

3

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, what Carachuri

4

involved was something very different.

It involved a

5

recidivism factor, an aggravating factor.

6

talking about an aggravating factor, Apprendi

7

jurisprudence has treated those somewhat equivalent to

8

an element because it raises the statutory maximum.

9

so when you are trying to decide whether something is

When you are

10

punishable as a felony, it's natural to look at the

11

aggravating factor.

And

12

The other thing I would say about Carachuri

13

is that it's easily distinguishable on the grounds that

14

Justice Ginsburg raised.

15

argument in Carachuri was much more difficult.

16

government was trying to rely on a recidivism factor

17

that was not part of the predicate conviction.

18

was trying to rely on that factor to elevate what was

19

otherwise a misdemeanor under both State and Federal law

20

to a felony.

21

It -- the government's
The

And it

Here, the predicate conviction itself has

22

all the elements that are required for a Federal felony

specific intent to distribute it.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. SHAH:

I think there are -- I think

8

there are two ways, Your Honor, that -- two different

9

lines of reasoning that show that the government's

10

approach to the categorical part of the inquiry is -- is

11

the right approach and not Petitioner's approach.

12

first is --

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

However you do it, the

misdemeanor still has the same three elements.

15

MR. SHAH:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

between it being a misdemeanor or a felony?

18

MR. SHAH:

Well, here's -- here's how --

Right.

So how do we choose

I think here -- here are

19

the two ways you get there.

20

this Court has consistently formulated the categorical

21

inquiry.

22

compare the elements of the predicate offense to the

23

those of the generic offense.

24
25

First is by looking at how

Starting with Taylor, pre-Apprendi case,

Fast forward past Apprendi through all of
the more recent cases, Lopez and not -- still the same
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inquiry, focusing on the elements of the predicate and

2

the elements of the generic.

3

If that is not enough for you,

4

Justice Sotomayor, if there is still some uncertainty as

5

to when you have mitigating factors, like in this case,

6

and the question is, well, does the predicate conviction

7

have to affirmatively negate those narrow mitigating

8

criteria, then this Court can look, if it wants to go to

9

first principles, look at this Court's decision in

10

Nijhawan.

11

There, it had a different aggravating

12

felony, certain fraud and deceit offenses which resulted

13

in a $10,000 loss to the victim.

14

look, fraud and deceit, those are clearly elements, we

15

are going to apply the categorical approach to -- to

16

figure out whether those elements are satisfied.

17

the $10,000 loss factor, we're not sure.

18

whether the predicate offense has to affirmatively

19

establish it or not.

What the Court said,

But

We're not sure

And so what the Court did is it did a survey

20
21

of the 50 States.

It looked at the 50 States.

And it

22

turns out that, in a vast majority of those States, the

23

predicate conviction will never establish that $10,000

24

loss factor.

25

underinclusive aggravated felony.

And so you're going to have a vastly

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And that's something that Congress -- that

2

Congress could not have intended.

3

Congress would not have intended its aggravated felony

4

provision to apply in such a limited and haphazard

5

manner.

6

The Court said

I submit that's exactly what you have here

7

on pages 26 to 30 of our brief.

And Petitioner does not

8

take issue with a single one of the statutes that we

9

cite.

And we go through all 50 of them.

We show that,

10

in a clear majority of the States, the predicate

11

conviction will not establish that there is remuneration

12

or more than a small amount.

13

Congress cannot --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shah, I think the

15

problem with your main argument is that it leads you to

16

a result that you don't want to accept because your main

17

argument is all we've done in our past cases -- and I

18

can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done

19

is compare the elements.

20

But if all we do is compare the elements,

21

then we don't get to your discretionary scheme in which

22

we also admit evidence of -- of the case-specific nature

23

of the offense.

24
25

I mean, so your arguments all go towards a
very purist solution.

And then you say, oh, no, that's
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a crazy solution.

2

would wind up saying that misdemeanants, like this

3

person, like people who are actually convicted under

4

(b)(4) who are clearly misdemeanants, would wind up as

5

aggravated felons and -- and must be deported.

6

It's a crazy solution because we

MR. SHAH:

Well, well, first, Your Honor, I

7

am glad that we have an agreement on the first part of

8

the categorical inquiry because I think that is the main

9

part of the inquiry that this -- that would establish -JUSTICE KAGAN:

10
11

I don't think we really have

an agreement --

12

MR. SHAH:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to

15

elements.

the way you're arguing for, we wouldn't get the result

17

that you're arguing for.

18

But if we were just to look to elements in

MR. SHAH:

Again, Your Honor, I think you

19

have to look at this particular aggravated felony, which

20

I think is structured similar to other aggravated

21

felonies in the INA.

22

If you look at the aggravated felony in the

23

INA that's on page -- top of page 34 of our brief, and

24

that -- that is the one about document fraud crimes, it

25

says the alien -- then, if the alien then shows that
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that document fraud crime was perpetrated in order to

2

help a family member, then no more aggravated felony.

3

How does the alien make that showing?

He

comes into immigration court -- after it's already been

5

established that you have the predicate document fraud

6

felony, he comes into immigration court.

7

bring forth evidence on his own that shows that it

8

satisfied this familial exception to that document fraud

9

aggravated felony.

10

He has to

I think the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the whole

11

point -- the whole point is that there is no similar

12

provision in the statute at issue in this case, right?

13

MR. SHAH:

I think the point is that there

14

is a similar provision.

15

incorporates the CSA to define the aggravated felony.

16

The CSA says it's a felony if you have possession plus

17

intent to distribute, unless the defendant shows -- and

18

this is how it has been interpreted by every court of

19

appeals that has interpreted the CSA -- unless the

20

defendant shows it was only a small amount for no

21

remuneration.

22

In the -- the INA here

That is an identical formulation to some of

23

the other aggravated felonies in the provision.

24

those other aggravated felony provisions have been

25

interpreted is to allow the alien to come into
51
Alderson Reporting Company

And how

Official

1

immigration court to show the exception.

2

We are not aware of a single court decision

3

that has ever interpreted any similar provision in any

4

of the other aggravated felony provision to require the

5

predicate conviction to affirmatively negate it.

6

And that's exactly what Petitioner's main

7

submission is, that this predicate conviction has to

8

affirmatively negate the possibility of a narrow

9

mitigating exception.

That is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

I don't think that that is

11

quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute,

12

what it most looks like is that Congress is simply

13

classifying two different kinds of conduct.

14

Congress has the -- the social sharing

15

conduct, and that's in one section.

16

else, the more dangerous conduct, is in another section.

17

And the everything

And so it's not something where it's like,

18

oh, you're trying to get them to negate a specific -- a

19

point.

20

two -- and one is a felony, and one is a misdemeanor.

21

And that's the -- the real way to understand this

22

statute.

23

Congress has created two separate sections,

And then the categorical approach suggests,

24

well, in that case, we accept the underinclusion, rather

25

than the overinclusion.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I disagree with

2

that characterization of that statute.

3

appeals that has considered this statute has rejected

4

the argument that we have two separate offenses and that

5

the -- that the government, in order to get to the

6

higher offense, the -- the default felony provision,

7

that the government would have to treat as elements

8

the -- the mitigating criteria of remuneration and small

9

amount.

10

Every court of

Every court of appeals has rejected that.
If this statute were drawn as you suggest,

11

and it were elements of a crime, that is, you had two

12

separate offenses, one is possession with intent to

13

distribute a small amount for no remuneration, or it

14

could just say possession with intent to distribute

15

marijuana, if that was one distinct offense that was a

16

misdemeanor, and then Congress created a second offense

17

that says, in cases where there is more than a small

18

amount, in which there is remuneration, then you get a

19

five-year maximum instead of a one-year maximum, that is

20

effectively making, as an element, the government to

21

disprove both the possibility of no remuneration and

22

more than a small amount.

23

If that was the statutory scheme that were

24

at issue, I would agree with you, Petitioner would

25

prevail under the categorical approach.

Alderson Reporting Company

2

They do not disagree with that.

They --

they agree that every court of appeals that has

4

interpreted this has interpreted it as one offense and

5

that those mitigating criteria are just that, they are

6

mitigating exceptions and not offense elements.

7
8

I think the other point I would make, Your
Honor, is that --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't understand,

10

Mr. Shah.

11

I mean, why should we -- why should we accept that

12

labeling, rather than, look, what Congress did here was

13

to say that certain kinds of offenses are felonies

14

deserving of grave punishment, and other kinds of

15

offenses are misdemeanors deserving of less than a year

16

in prison, and -- and we see those -- those categories

17

of conduct differently.

18

That seems just a question of labeling to me.

And if you are saying that if Congress

19

had -- had said two separate offenses, then the

20

categorical approach means that Mr. Goldstein's client

21

wins, I guess I just don't get what in this statute

22

suggests something different from that.

23

MR. SHAH:

Two things, Your Honor.

One is I

24

don't think it's a matter of labeling because Congress

25

knows that these labels actually have big consequences.

If you made those mitigating criteria elements, that

would be a very different statute, which the government

doubt that it's more -- more than a small quantity.

Counsel, I thought that

10

when Congress enacted this provision, there was not the

11

distinction between elements and sentencing factors that

12

we now have, that the statute was enacted, in other

13

words, before Apprendi.

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, this statute was

enacted before Apprendi, but Apprendi doesn't change the

interpretation of this statute.

17

relevant criteria.

18

This statute -- in the

This statute was interpreted -- interpreted

19

both the same before and after Apprendi, with respect to

20

the default provision, because the default provision

21

doesn't require any factors or elements at all to get to

22

the felony provision.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may be, but it

certainly goes to your argument that Congress had in

mind some distinction between elements and sentencing
55

factors.

2

MR. SHAH:

Well, I think what Congress had

3

in mind is that those mitigating criteria would not be

4

treated as elements.

5

And, Justice Kagan, to get back to your

6

question, how do we know?

Well, we can look at what --

7

the inquiry that the Court did in Nijhawan.

8

not be -- it would not be consistent with Congressional

9

intent to assume that Congress intended that this

It would

10

aggravated felony provision would not have any effect in

11

the clear majority of States that do not make either

12

remuneration or more than a small quantity an element of

13

the offense.

14

That is what Nijhawan was about.

It was

15

trying to figure out, did Congress intend this

4

MR. SHAH:

I think the modified categorical

approach would allow -- would allow --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that in -- in many of

6

these cases that we're talking about, it is possible

7

that the plea allocution itself would set out the

8

amounts that the alien sold or show that he sold

9

something --

10

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor, I think --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and that would take

12

care of this issue of how many people are escaping

14

MR. SHAH:

I think if the -- the plea

15

agreement or plea colloquy set forth the amount and it

16

was more than a small amount, I think the modified --

17

our position would be that the modified categorical

18

approach would allow you to reach that.

19

Petitioner's and his amici's argument are

20

essentially that the plea agreements aren't going to say

21

that in a large majority of these cases, for the simple

22

reason that a -- that a vast majority of the States

23

don't make more than a small quantity an element of the

24

crime, and so it's going to be irrelevant.

And if that's the case, then the

government would agree that, if we were to lose this

for Convention Against Torture relief and withholding of

For example, a

It also has implications beyond the

7

And so in any illegal

If Petitioner's rule were to prevail in a

significant number of those cases, in any State in which

it did not have those relevant elements, that sentencing

enhancement would no longer have operative effect.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I told

18

you I was going to acknowledge the strengths of the

19

other side's case.

20

you can conceivably read the statute their way.

21

question is, if you actually adopt their statutory

22

construction argument and you say we're going to look at

23

the elements and it's an aggravated felony, we're

24

comparing two different ways of reading it.

25

And I want to just recognize that
But the

And they admit that their way of reading the
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute comes up with an answer that Congress couldn't

2

possibly have intended by treating all these

3

misdemeanants as aggravated felons.

4

Now, their solution is to add a whole

5

'nother proceeding that isn't in the statute.

Another

6

solution is just to recognize their reading is wrong.

7

If it produces this ridiculous result that Congress

8

couldn't have intended, and our reading is perfectly

9

sensible and not only do you have the solution of the

10

removal proceedings, but also Justice Kennedy's

11

suggestion of the Attorney General's ability to issue an

12

order, Justice Sotomayor's solution of being able to

13

look at the plea allocution, questions that aren't

14

presented here, but lots of ways of addressing any

15

adverse consequences of our rule.

16
17

What in statutory construction allows us
just to add this procedure that --

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:
"punishable," I think.
MR. SHAH:

20
21
22

But it's the word

Well, "punishable" is a good

word -JUSTICE BREYER:

So you're thinking, under

23

Georgia law, this is punishable as a felony only if it

24

wasn't a small amount used for personal use, you see,

25

and therefore, they go into the hearing.
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's not punishable as an 841 felony, unless

2

those two things are absent, and therefore, they have

3

the hearing to find out.

4

doesn't appear in the statutes, the other ones that

5

we've construed.

6

And the word "punishable"

That's what I thought they were doing.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

But I don't think

7

that's actually what they're doing because Mr. Shah did

8

not deny Justice Kagan's questions about, yeah, it would

9

produce this ridiculous result, and so we're going to

10

add this other proceeding.

11

When they say -- what they do with

12

punishable is they say look at only the elements of the

13

Federal offense.

14

Georgia conviction, even though, Justice Ginsburg, lots

15

of these convictions will just be equivalents to Federal

16

misdemeanors because they are the equivalent of --

17

because they involve possession with intent to

18

distribute, those are the only elements of the offense,

19

then they're all punishable as felonies, even if they

20

would be a misdemeanor.

21

And that's how they say that any

So I don't think punishable helps them.

22

they don't seem to argue on the basis of punishable.

23

my base point to you is that why, in choosing between

24

these two readings, we have strengths, they have

25

strengths.

And

Their argument starts from the proposition

So

63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that theirs produces a result that Congress couldn't

2

have intended.

3

And, Mr. Chief Justice, they did start out

4

with the hardcore position.

5

It's our case.

6

even though he was not convicted of selling, they

7

ordered him mandatorily deportable without an inquiry

8

into the underlying facts.

9

right.

10
11

I can give you the example.

Remember, even though this is 1.3 grams,

They recognize that can't be

And so they are trying to tack something on to

the statute that doesn't appear in the statute.
The last point that I want to address is

12

actually a very small one.

13

Justice Thomas' dissent in the Lopez case on whether you

14

should look to the State definition of whether this is a

15

felony or instead, the Federal one, because the

16

government cites it in a footnote in their brief.

17

And that's about

And we would only say that the government is

18

not relying on the Lopez dissent.

It invokes Lopez

19

repeatedly in the Federal courts.

And so this is a

20

situation in which the Court's decision in Lopez should

21

take hold as a matter of statutory -- stare decisis, and

22

what matters here is the Federal treatment of it.

23

When you don't know if the Georgia

24

conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under Federal

25

law, you don't know which one it is, what the
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

categorical rule says is that the State conviction

2

doesn't necessarily establish it's a Federal offense,

3

the Federal felony here, and therefore, you don't treat

4

it that way.

5

The -- the arguments that my friend ended

6

with -- ended with about, hey, this is going to be

7

applied in Federal sentencing and lots of other

8

contexts, makes it worse, not better.

9

are we going to have these others Castro-Rodriguez

How in the world

10

proceedings, these other intermediate proceedings about

determining the facts of the offense in Federal
