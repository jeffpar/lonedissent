Case No. 269, Lester Gunn,

et al,„ appellants, versus University Committee to End the
War in Viet Nam, et al,
Mr. Louisell?
ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. LOUISELL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. LOUISELLs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
Few cases that I have seen in recent years so much
invoke the ancient admonition, "Oh to distinguish the reality
of things from the tyranny of labels/’ or as this Court put it,
I believe, in Trap against Dulles, "How simple would be the
tasks of constitutional adjudication if the decision of specific
problems were a matter of selecting the labels pasted upon them."
We respectfully submit, Your Honors, that the 3-judge
District Court below, from the Western District of Texas, by
seizing upon the label of Dombrowski against Pfister, without
penetrating through to the context and the meaning in context
of that teaching of this Court, that the 3-judge court has done
violence to the realities of the situation, has defied logic,
experience and history, and requires reversal.
Now, our facts here, Your Honors, are from a stipu­
lation between the appellants' and the appellees' counsel, and
from the affidavits filed by the individual plaintiffs and a
2

few of their fellow students, and the affidavits of the Sheriff

z

of Bell County, Texas, and hi3 deputies»

the facts here, those stipulations and affidavits.

That is the source of

Very briefly, on December 12, 1967, just a little more1

5

than four years within the shadow of Dallas, the President went

6

to Central Texas College to make a dedicatory speech.

7

before his arrival, the Secret Service had a conference with the

8

local police officers of the surrounding cities, with the

9

sheriffs of both counties.

The land involved here lies in both

10

Bell and Coryell Counties.

They had a conference soliciting

11

cooperation in protection of the President.
On the morning of December 12th, the plaintiffs and

12

13
14
15

16

others, members of the committee, their associates, hearing
that this event was going to take place, started out from
Austin, about 60 or 70 miles from Killeen, and proceeded to the
neighborhood of Killeen, Texas.
This college is near Killeen.

Killeen serves one of

the biggest military reservations in the United States, Fort
Hood, thousands of troops stationed there, many of them on
their way to Viet Nam, many of them just returned from Viet
Nam.
These people, at least seven in number, and at least
in two automobiles, proceeded to the area of the college where
the President was to speak, and when they arrived there, he had
begun to speak, or was about to begin.

On the basis of those facts, I have a little

difficulty seeing how they fit within the language of the Texas

statute appearing on the bottom of page 2 and the top of page 3

of your brief.
A

13

That is correct.

I don’t see how it was possible.

Of course, we are dealing here with a rural area, a non-lawyer

Q

Or the displaying of a weapon.

2

A

As the statute reads, "Whoever shall go into or

3

near any public place, or into or near any private house, and

4

shall use loud and vociferous, or obscene, vulgar, or indecent

5

language, or swear or curse, or yell or shriek, or expose his

8

or her person to another person of the age of 16 years or over"

7

another statute, of course, for those under 16 —* "or rudely

8

display any pistol or deadly weapon in a manner calculated to

9

disturb the person or persons present at such place or house

10

shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $200."
Q

II

I suppose it could be argued that the use of —

12

not of loud and vociferous, certainly -- but the use of obscene,

13

vulgar or indecent language could be, by writing rather than

14

orally —

15

A

Undoubtedly, but there is no indication that

16

there was any obscenity involved in the language here, or any

17

indecent protest involved in the language.

18

The important thing to stress, it seems to me, in

19

the study of the facts here, is that despite the occasion —

and there were about 25,000 —

21

Q

Who do you represent, counsel?

22

A

I represent the appellants, the Sheriff, the

23

County Attorney, and the Justice of the Peace.

I am confused„

You have just conceded that the

statute had no applicability to this.

I thought the three-judge court had struck down

the statute for over-breadth„ didn't it?
A

5

It struck down the statute, as nearly as one can

6

tell, for over-breadth, and it struck it down in the abstract,

1

and it specifically said it wasn't examining into the appli­

8

cation of the statute.

9

Q

Well, your position, then, is what, may I ask?

10

A

Our position is twofold:

First of all, that in

11

the situation that developed here, with a dismissal of these

12

foolish criminal charges under the so-called ’’Disturbed" or

13

"Diet’d the Peace" complaint that had been filed,, the dismissal

14

of those charges, and the complete absence of a scintilla of

IS

Judication that the State of Texas was using this statute to

16

repress freedom of speech rendered the case purely an advisory

17
18

proposition and that the 3-judge court should have granted the
motion to dismiss.

19

That is the first proposition.

20

The second proposition is that if you do have to

21

22
23
24
25

reach the question of the statute's constitutionality, or if
the court below had to, on its face it is clearly not an un­
constitutional statute as vague or over-broad.
Q

You say that as it was interpreted, the law,

V

that it was unconstitutional?
6

A

They didn't interpret it below, Your Honor„

Excuse me.

I mean they didn't apply it to the facts.

You will note, from the opinion of the court below, on page 89,
the court says:
"Before we discuss the issues presented as to the
merits of this controversy, it may be wise to state what
is not involved..'1
At the top of page 89.
"This case does not involve in any way an appraisal
of the constitutionality of the application of the statutes
to the plaintiffs.

We do not evaluate whether Article 474

was constitutionally applied to these plaintiffs’ activi­
ties.

Our sole concern is the determination of whether
*

Article 474, on its face, is unconstitutional," and so forth.
Q

Where is the injunction in the record?

A

The injunction, I must admit, is couched in very

unusual format.

The injunction comes at the very end of that

opinion on page 92, at the bottom of the page.
Q

"They are entitled to their declaratory judgment

that the statute is impermissibly unconstitutionally broad and
to injunctive relief against the enforcement of Article 474, as
now worded, insofar as it may affect rights guaranteed under the
First Amendment."

Is that it?

A

That is correct.

Q

Is that all we have in the way of an order?
7

A

That is all we have by way of a judgment.

Q

And is that what is here before us for review?

A

That is what is here.

Q

And you say that what we should do is reverse

That is the appeal that

is taken.

that order, to the extent it is an order, and what — remand
with direction to dismiss the complaint?
A

That would be the correct procedure; reverse with

instructions to dismiss the complaint as utterly a nonexistent
controversy.
Q

We never reverse in the case of a moot case.

.A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

You say this is a nonexistent controversy?

A

That is precisely right.

We

vacate.

if you wish, I can get right into that.

I think it can be shown —
I might just mention a

little more of the chronology here, in case it isn’t completely
clear.
The point I wanted to stress about the facts is that
no State official, no State Trooper, no Sheriff, no city police­
man, did anything to inhibit these people coming and making their
protest.
Q

Counsel,

may I ask you this question:

two problems here as I understand this case.
issue of jurisdiction.

You have

One is a Dombrowski

The other is a question as to whether this
8

statute is unconstitutional on its face.
Now, what actually happened here is that there was a
criminal prosecution of these people who are here as appellants.
That was dismissed.

There was no basis for it under the statutes,

according to the Texas courts.

That, is not this case.

Subse­

quently —
A

The exact basis of the dismissal was; that it

took place on a Federal enclave, and was not even within the
jurisdiction of the State.
Q

All right»

Subsequently, this suit was instituted

by the people who appear her® as appellees.
A

Right„

Q

They were before a 3-judge court, and that 3-judge

court granted a declaratory judgment and entered the order that,
you said, and then said "We will stay the mandate and we will
not actually enter an order of injunction right now, but a
declaratory judgment was granted"; is that right?
A

Well, they said they would await any further

injunctive order until a meeting of the Texas Legislature, which
Legislature has convened.
Q

They did say the plaintiffs are entitled to a

declaratory judgment, and that they wouldn’t do anything further
by way of injunction until after the Texas Legislature met; is
that right?
A

But they also said that plaintiffs were entitled
9

to an injunction,
Q

I understand that.

Your argument here is that

there was no jurisdiction under Domforowski to entertain this
action? is that right?
A

That is correct,

Q

And do you also argue that if jurisdiction lies,

that nevertheless, the statute is not unconstitutional on its
face?
A

Precisely,

Those are the two points that I wish

to emphasise.
Now, to make the rest of the chronology very brief,
remember, if I may say thiss that it was the military police who
detained these plaintiffs, and it was only after they had de­
tained them, and that they were brought into the presence of the
State people, that they were taken by the State people to the
jail where this charge which, if it hadn't been dismissed, be­
cause of the Federal enclave, certainly would have had to be
dismissed for the reasons already suggested from the Bench,
They were released on bail.

Their attorney promptly

came and got them released on bail, and it was on December 21st
that they started this 3-judge suit.
On February 13, as already mentioned, all these
criminal charges were dismissed, February 13, 1968,

On February

15, therefore, the defendants, the appellants here, defendants
in the 3-judge suit, moved to dismiss the suit for the reasons
10

already suggested from the Bench»
Counsel for these appellants wanted the. motion

in

fact, he made a special motion to have his motion to dismiss
heard first, but the court insisted on merging the motion to
dismiss with a hearing on the merits and filed the opinion that
we just read from, the concluding order part of it, on April
10th.
There was a motion for a new trial that was denied,
a so-called addendum opinion written, and the appeal was taken
to this Court.
Q

I am just confused.

Are you saying that that

complaint does not make a charge under 474?
A

I am saying that I cannot conceive how that com­

plaint would make a charge --- that is, a sustainable charge —
under 474.
Q

What it says is that, deposes and says that one

Damon on the 12th did then and there unlawfully and willfully —
I guess that means "disturb the peace," is that right?
A

That is right.

Of course, in print it looks as

though it were a new document, but it was a form merely filled
in by the Justice of the Peace.
Q

If this is not a charge under 474, what is it?

A

Well, it was undoubtedly intended, Your Honor,

by this lay Justice of the Peace, to be a charge, but you don’t
charge a person with disturbing the peace.
11

You may, as a

preliminary matter, hoping for a plea of guilty, but a sustain­
able „ legal charge has to be in the legal language that you are
complaining about; that they did loudly and vociferously, in a
public place, and so forth,, just as you don't charge a man with
murder; you charge him with having on such-and-such a date -Q

1 know, but what I am trying to get at is that

you are telling us that there is no issue under Section 474 be­
fore us, and never has been in
A

this litigation; is that right?

That there never was a valid criminal charge

made against these people»
Q

No, that6s not my question.

Are you telling us

that this complaint makes no charge under 474 and, therefore,
no question on the face or otherwise under 474 is even in this
litigation?
A

I axa saying that this >/a3 not a sustainable

legal charge under 474, in my judgment.

But I don't suppose

that is too important, because in any event, this was dismissed.
This was dismissed because of the Federal enclave proposition.
What had not been dismissed, Your Honor, because of the Federal
enclave, it seems to me that unless it were correctly amended
to state a charge, the judge would have had to throw it out on
motion of the defendants, and if he didn’t, certainly the
Criminal Court of Appeals would have thrown it out.
Therefore, when they come into Federal Court with a
3-judge suit, there is just no real fight of any true kind to
12

complain about.
Now, if I may come to the substance of the case,, as
has already been indicated from the Bench, from a legal view­
point this really marges into the two points you indicated, Mr.
Justice, the advisory point and the question of the facial, socalled, unconstitutionality of the statute.
In addition to the cases in our brief on the advisory
point, this Court will remember just at the last term, the com­
prehensive review of the whole Frothingham problem in Flast
against Cohen, where the Court had occasion to go, I think, to
the philosophic depths of the whole notion of justiciability
and the advisory opinion as a function of it.
In addition to the cases cited in the brief, I invite
particular attention to cases as old as the famous Musfcad case,
and even older, the case cited in the Flash against Cohen
opinion, California against the San Pablo Railroad and the other
cases cited in the Flast opinion.
But it really seems to me — it really seems to me -that the most recent cases of this Court, just the Princess
Anne County Commission case decided at thi3 very term, where
a 10-day order was set aside because it was ex parte, with no
chance for an adversary exchange.

That case, although brought

up by the appellees, I think, is excellent authority for a
realistic appraisal of whether there was any contest, any genuine
justiciable controversy before the Federal 3-judge court.
13

On the constitutionality of the statute , if that has
to be reached, let me just say that if this statute is uncon­
stitutionally broad; is guilty of over-breadth or vagueness,
what about our California comparable section, 415 of the penal
code?

What about the New York section on disorderly conduct,

revised as recently as 1965, Section 24„20 of McKinney’s New
York Statutes?

What about the Connecticut statute that is set

forth in detail in the case we cite, fcha case of Barber against
Kinsella?
What about the Minnesota statute, to pick a midwestern
jurisdiction?

Minnesota Statutes Annotated, Section 609„72.

Even the American Law Institute hasn’t been able to do anything
much more satisfactory than this Texas language in its proposed
Section 250,2 on disorderly conduct, "makes unreasonable noise
or offensively coarse utterance," and so forth,
I submit in confidence that a condemnation of the
Texas statute, written, of course, not in scientific jargon,
not so many decibels, but in the common parlance of the country,
is, on its face, unconstitutional..

If it ever has been, or if

it ever is applied in such a way as to deny people their First
Amendment rights, or to inhibit them in any realistic sense,
not only does Texas law, but Federal law under this Court’s
holding in Monroe against Pape, provides a very fine remedy when
there is a true controversy.
Q

Well, since these complaints were dismissed
14

during the course of this civil proceeding in the Federal Court,
are you also making the argument that the mere fact of the dis­
missal removed any basis upon which the 3-judge court could
either render a declaratory judgment or injunctive relief?

There

was nothing to enjoin, no prosecutions to enjoin, and nothing
about which to give a declaratory judgment since there was no
threat of invoking this statute against these people in the
future? is that what you are saying?
A

Not precisely that, because if, in fact, the

threat of the statute's application to inhibit First Amendment
rights lurked in the background, as in the Dcmbrowski case —
Q

What do you do in Zwickler and Koota, where we

said, when we sent it back to the 3-judge court, this may not
be a situation for a declaratory judgment at all.

There are

elements required to maintain a declaratory judgment.
them they couldn't have any injunction in that case.

We told
They would

be entitled, at most, to a declaratory judgment, but only if
that was the proper suit for a declaratory judgment in the cir­
cumstances within the elements that controlled it.
Is that what this is?
A

Not at all.

In that case there was a very

serious, basic, substantive conflict about whether free speech —
Q

You seem so anxious to get us to say that they

were wrong on reaching the constitutional question of this
statute on the surface, on the face.
15

If it was, then it was

not a proper suit for a declaratory judgment or injunction, then
why isn’t that the end of the case as —
A

It is.

Q

We don't have to say they were wrong in -holding

that this

It isn't a proper suit.

statute is unconstitutional on its face, then, do we?
A

Well, I don't say you have to reach that question,

no? but if you do reach it, I do say the answer is very clear
and I think the Koota situation is very clearly distinguishable.
There, as I read the opinion of this Court -Q

I don't understand why you want to distinguish it.

I am trying to help you.
A

I don't understand it because —

The Koota case has gone back to the District

Court for the reason —
Q

I know, but what we said, and what we said in

Koota was that, yes, he is entitled to a declaratory judgment,
even though not to an injunction in the circumstances, not much
different from this, but he is not even entitled to a declaratory
judgment unless you are satisfied that the elements which make
up that course of action have been satisfied.
A

That is right.

I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.

Mr. Clinton?

ARGUMENT OF SAM HOUSTON CLINTON, JR., ESQ.

XX

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. CLINTON;

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
I think in essence \?hat counsel was indicating when
he said that this statute was not applicable was that my clients
were not guilty of violating the statute and, of course, that
is clear.

Not that it has much to do with the issue, but I

gather that is what he was saying, which brings us to what this
lawsuit is all about.
The University Committee, and the named plaintiffs,
feeling that there was the chilling effect that this Court has
spoken of in similar type cases, a chilling effect on the exer­
cise of their First Amendment rights, they sued in the court
below and a three-judge court was convened.
They asked for three things, essentially;

declaratory

relief that Article 474 was facially invalid.
Q

Isn't it a fact that these criminal complaints

were dismissed before that proceeding was concluded?
A

No, sir.

Qh, before it was concluded.

I am sorry.

Q

Yes.

A

The underlying complaints were dismissed after

the three-judge court had been convened and the matter was
noticed for hearing.
17

Q

But before

A

But before we actually got before the 3-judge

And was the 3-judge court apprised that they

had been dismissed before it ended?
A
Q

By motion? yes, sir®
Then what — how do you justify the 3-judge court

going on to deal with the case»
A

The same way that the 3-judge court justified it,

with emphasis, if I mays

The 3-judge court found, based upon

uncontrovarted evidence before it *— in tills case testimony in
the form of agreed affidavits — that if the people were in
court and so testified, this is what they would testify to, not
only the three plaintiffs, but the two affiants who were a part
of the party ff seven represented to the court under oath that
they had felt the chilling effect of these prosecutions and
had ceased all activities in behalf of the University Committee
to End the War in Viet Nam? that they knew others who had done
so.
It was for this reason that the court said we do have
not just a broad curtailment of activities, but a suspension of
expression altogether.

It went on to find that the dispute was

a live one, a very live one, because here people were saying
to the court, "We are no longer taking part in these activities
that we had before we were handled in the %tfay we were handled
18

up in Bell County."
Q

Was there anything in the stipulation whether

there was any suggestion that this statute was going to be en­
forced against others in this situation of protest against Viet
Nam?
A

There was a suggestion in two ways:

One in the

pattern of the conduct of at least two of the appellants here,
who were the defendants below, the Sheriff and the Justice of
the Peace, that, to put it bluntly, the Sheriff said in the
record, "You folks get out of my county and don't come back.
We don't like people like you around here."
The J.P. said, the Justice of the Peace said, when
the people came before him, "We don't like traitors in this
county and 1 am setting a $500 bond on your case, although the
maximum fine is $200, to make sure that you come back because
I want to try this case."
Q

I suppose that all collapsed when the complaints

were dismissed.
A

Well, that particular part collapsed, but you

were asking about any continuing threat, and here they are tell­
ing them, "Don't come back.
Q

If you do, we are” in effect —

Has anything happened since?

Have any of these

folks been prosecuted for anything since?
A

There is no evidence of —

Q

Have there been any demonstrations since?
19

A

Well, the people say they are not going to

demonstrate in Bell County as long as the Sheriff acts like, he
does and the J„P. puts them under a $500

invokes a statute

that counsel now tells the Court we are in no manner guilty of.
That is the thrust of the basis of their saying that
they are, therefore, not —
Q

Does this declaratory judgment stop them from

saying, "I don’t want you in my county.

If you come in here

again, I am going to give you a $500 fine”?
A

No, sir.

The declaratory judgment —* may I pre­

Q

Do you think there is a final judgment?

A

Well, I mention that at the beginning of my

motion, to affirm, but since it has been used in other — since
this similar type thing has happened, particularly in some of
your reapportionment cases, I figured it was probably final,
and apparently the court thought so, too.

dentally — met in Special Session as distinguished from regular
session# and adjourned without taking any action because of the
limited nature of that session.
Then before we could go back to the three-judge court
for any further action# papers were filed in this Court and the
mandate was stayed further# so that is the situation as far as
the outstanding nature of any kind of order.

There just isn’t

any. We have the opinion and it has been stayed.

The mandate

was stayed first by the court below and now by this Court.
Q

Mr. Clinton# are you suggesting that if the law

enforcement authorities of a county come to demonstrators and
say# "Now look hare# we don’t like demonstrations in this
county# and if you try to demonstrate here we are going to
prosecute you under this statute #“ that in and of itself that
is enough to authorize a Federal District Court to consider
the constitutionality of the statute mentioned by the law en­
forcement authorities# and if they find it unconstitutional on
its face, to enjoin its application?
A

Well# no.

Is that it?

I think there is more to it.

There is

more to this case than that.
Q

Well# there was at the beginning# but what was
21

there after the complaints were dismissed more than that?
A

I am satisfied that the court below took into

consideration perhaps the good faith of even the dismissal of
the complaints, for examplec

You sea, there is absolutely no

evidence in thi3 record that these events did, in fact, take
place on what is now described as a Federal enclave»

There is

simply no evidence that that is so*
In fact, circumstantially, as the counsel said, the
military police first put their hands on the protestors and
then delivered them into the hands of the Deputy Sheriff while
still on the college campus, suggesting that maybe it wasn’t
truly on a Federal enclave where criminal jurisdiction had been
ceded»
So I say first that I think the court below maybe
looked at the timing of the filing of the motion to dismiss
and the grounds of the motion to dismiss and the fact that there
was no evidence in support of it, plus the court obviously
looked to the things that I am suggesting should be looked to,
the continuing suspension by these persons of their own activi­
ties in Bell County particularly.
I think it ought to be said about Bell County that
housing, or being the home, as it is, of Fort Hood, and being a
military installation, this particular committee that I repre­
sent looks upon it as a proper place in which to spread its
views„
22

So it is more than just barring, or these people feel­
ing they can't go to Bell County.

Bell County is the place they

think they ought to be, as distinguished from even some of the
adjoining counties.
Q

It is of special significance to —

Is that statute the only breach of peace statute

there is on the Texas books?
A

No, it is not the only one.

It is the general

Q

How were these charges tied up with this statute?

A

Well, we allege that that is what was involved

statute —

and the appellants here denied in their answer that 474 was
unconstitutional and we stipulated in that stipulation that what
was at issue was Article 474, all of which was raised before
the 3-judge court on a motion for a new trial, analysed by the
3-judge court, ur.d the 3-judge court says clearly we have been
litigating Article 474 here or we wouldn't have been here to
start with.
Q

Is there a common law breach of the peace in

A

No, sir.

Texas ?
But I wanted to answer your other ques­

tion because behind Article 474 there are other statutes that
may be said to relate to a breach of the peace, but this is the
one that has the short title "Disturbing the Peace," and this is
the one that we have all agreed was raised here and was in­
volved.
23

One other sort of technical matter, what you have
before you, or what we had before us that was dismissed was a
complaint filed by the Sheriff or the Deputy Sheriff before
the Justice of the Peace, and insofar as counsel says it is
inadequate to allege an offense, of course, we don't stand
trial, necessarily, on that offense.

We stand trial on any

information that is later issued by the County Attorney based
upon that charge that has been filed.
We have to make bond.

We are put in jail and we have

to make bond to be released from the charge,
G

You don’t yet know until the information issues,

what charge you had to defend against,
A

Rightt what specific part of that very broad

and multi-faceted —■
Q

And before what court would the information be

A

The Justice of the Peace in this instance, the

charged?

same Justice of the Peace who made —
Q

And then what is there — an appeal de novo or

A

Yes, there is an appeal de novo,

something?
I'm sorry.

The extent of the fine determines the direction in which you
go.

Let's say there would be an appeal de novo,
Q

No indication that the Justice of the Peace, if

filed before him, or on the appeal da novo, that any defense
24

constitutional or otherwise might be entertained?
A

Well,, after the Justice of the Peace was saying

what he had done, we didn8t look forward to a trial before him*
He said as soon as they were brought before him that he did not
like traitors in his county, and then ha imposed — he said,
"You can plead guilty and the fine will be $200/’ which is the
maximum, incidentally, "or you can make a bond for $500»81
When the appellees, who were the plaintiffs below,
protested that that was rather excessive, he said, ’’Well, I
just want to make sure you are here so I can try this case»"
They did not believe that they had much future ahead before him.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

We will recess now.

(Whereupon, at 2:30 p.m. the argument in the aboveentitled matter was recessed, to reconvene at 10:00 a.m., Tues­
day, January 14, 1969»)
