ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.

No. 343. United States versus

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

court, this case is here on a write of certiorari to the

9

United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and it

10

an in rem seizure proceeding brought by the government against

11

an interstate shipment of five cases of antibiotic sensitivity

12

discs bearing the trade name Bacto-Unidisk.

13
14

15

Counsel have asked the clerk to distribute a sample
of the seized article to each member of the court.
The government’s libel alleged that the shipment

16

violated Section 502L of the Federal Food,Drug and Cosmetic

17

Act in that the Bacto-Unidisk was a drug within the meaning

18

of the Act, was composed in part of the specified antibiotics

19

and was neither certified, nor exempted from certification,

20

pursuant to Section 507 of the Act.

21

And the amended answer by the claimant Difco

22

Laboratories, the manufacturer of the Bacto-Unidisk, admits

23

that the article is composed in part of the specified

24

antibiotics, and as neither been certified nor exempted from

25

certification.
2

■I

The claimant's denial that the shipment violated

2

the Act was based solely on the contention that the antibiotic

3

certification requirements of the statute are inapplicable

4

because the Bacto-Unidisk is not a drug within the meaning of

5

the statute and the only issue in this case therefore, is
j

6

whether sensitivity testing discs, such as the Bacfco-Unidi*?'

7

are drugs within the definition in Section 201G of the Act,

8

which appears on page 2 of our brief.

9

;

This issue arises because Section 507 of the Act

10

imposes the batch testing certification requirement only on

11

antibiotic drugs and these are defined in Section 50? by

12

reference to the general term 'drug", which in turn is

13

defined for purposes of the entire Act in Section 201G.

14

Q

Where is that 507?

15

A

507 appears on page 3 of our brief.

That is

IS

the batch testing requirement for antibiotic drugs.

17

the middle of page 4 the definition of antibiotic drugs is

18

in terms of "drug" and that brings into play the general

19

definition of "drug" in the statute as a whole.

And in

20

Q

As X see 507 it talks about batches of drugs.

21

A

That refers to production batches.
(

22

Q

The certification of batches of drugs.

23

A

That is correct.

Each production batch has

24

to be certified by taking a sample from that production batch

25

and testing it to see that it has the proper characteristics
3
i

I

of identity and strength and potency, et cetera, to assure its

2

safety and efficacy of use and that has to be done before that

3

production batch of an antibiotic drug can be disseminated for

4

use.

3

Now, the manner in which the ,Ba.ctO“Unidisk and similar

6

products are used in the course of antibiotic therapy is

7

described in the Opinion and Findings of the District Court

8

and in the printed enclosure which claimant includes in each

9

carton of Bacto-Unidisk, which appears in the record, and to

10

which I shall refer later.

11

The discs are used in a screening test which in the

12

words of the District Court, "serves as a guide to a medical

13

doctor in his determination of the choice of antibiotics

14

he prescribes for a patient,"

15

This is accomplished by first drawing from the patient

16

a specimen of affected body fluid which contains the infecting

17

microorganisms that is causing his illness.

18

specimen is then taken to the hospital of other clinical

19

laboratory and placed upon a pulture medium in a small glass

HO

dish, a so-called Petri dish, where it is incubated for a

21

period of hours to assure that mature colonies of principal

22

infectihg organisms can be isolated from the specimen for use

23

in the sensitivity test.

24
25

Typically, this

This so-called isolate of the infecting microorganisms
is then applied upon a second culture medium in another Petri

4

i

dish and the dry paper sensitivity discs, each of which has

2

been impregnated

3

antibiotic, are placed upon the surface of this freshly

4

innoeulated culture.

5

with a certain quantity of a particular

During the ensuing incubation period of six to 18

6

hours, the antibiotics disseminate outward forming circular

7

zones around each of the small impregnated discs.

Can these be bought by a layman?

be bought on prescription?

Are they sold to doctors or what?

X don't know the answer to that.

A

10

Do they have to

They cannot

11

be bought until after they have been certified.

12

be marketed to anyone and as a practical matter, they are used

13

only in clinical laboratories.
Q

14

15

They cannot

Yes, your position is that they have to be

certified and the other is that they don't.

/

16

A

Well, that is correct.

17

Q

I want to know whether I can go into a drug store

______ _______.

;

18

and get one of these and perform one of these tests on myself.

19

It has a bearing, I should think, on your argument.

20

A

,Of course to my knowledge, they are not now

21

being disseminated and this would be a prescription drug,if

22

our position is correct,that they are a drug within the meaning

23

of the Act.

24

a difference in answering that question.

25

Q

Of course, if they are not a drug, that would make

But they are manufactured and sold for use by
5

I

clinical laboratories, not by individuals *

2

A

That is correct»

3

Q

That is what the product is, isn’t that

A

The product is intended for this testing use in

4

correct?

5
6

They are not intended —

laboratories and not to be ingested by individuals in any way.

7

As I say, in the tests the antibiotics disseminate

8

outward, forming circular zones around each of these small

§

impregnated discs and then if the infecting organism is

10

sensitive to the antibiotic on a particular disc, its growth
i

Vi

will be inhibited in the zone around that disc leaving a

12

clear circle, a so-called zone of inhibition, on the medium

13

in, the dish surrounding that particular disc.
,

But in the zones around discs containing an antibiotic jto

14
15

which the microorganism is resistant, the isolate will grow

16

leaving little or no clear area.
From the presence or absence of these zones of

17
18

inhibition around the various discs the microbiologist advises

19

the physician which of the antibiotics appear to be effective

20

and which appear to be ineffective against the infecting

21

microorganism.
This report is then used by the physician as a guide

22

t

23.

in selecting an antibiotic for treatment of his patient's

24

infection and these discs are quite widely used, as records

25

show.

There is testimony that the volume of disc sensitivity
6

1

testings is approximately 5,000 per month in one Chicago

2

hospital.

3

Q

The antibiotics are in the —

4

A

They are impregnated on each of the small

5

circular discs.

6

Q

Not by the doctor, but in —

7

A

In the manufacturer's laboratory in the

8

manufacture of them.

9

impregnated with various antibiotics labelled around the edge

10

and with one sulpha.

11

Q

12

13

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Are those antibiotics that are produced by

the manufacturer?

This is subject to the testing in the

batches of drugs in 507?
A

14
15

The disc as you have it is already

Not unless the discs are drugs and the use in

the disc is a drug.

Otherwise, there would be no batch

testing whatsoever of these antibiotics required under the
statute.

Unless they happen to be comingled with antibiotic

powders that are going to be disseminated for use directly
on patients, in which case, they would have been tested in
that form, but the batch testing requirement does require
testing of each form of the antibiotic as it is prepared for
use, because of the peculiar scientific problem of changing
the antibiotic from one form to another.
It is clear then that this discs contain antibiotic
substances, which in the words' of the statute are "chemical

7

1

substances which are produced by a microorganism and which have

2

the capacity to inhibit or destroy other microorganisms."

3

And it is equally clear that the use of the sensi­

4

tivity discs in medical practice is dependent upon the

5

purported capacity of the antibiotics impregnated on the discs

6

to function as antibiotics, to actually inhibit or destroy

7

the growth of microorganisms.

8
9
10

In this respect, the discs differ from medical books
or the Petri dishes in the laboratory or other articles that
may also be used as a guide to therapy.
Now for more than 20 years. Congress has recognized

It

12

in Section 507 of the Act and its success sive amendments, that

13

because of the particular scientific properties of these

14

biologically produced antibiotic drugs, special quality

15

control procedures must be required to assure their scientific

16

reliability, or in the words of the statute, "to insure their

17

safety and efficacy of use."
Section 507 therefore, requires that before it is

18
!9

disseminated each production batch of antibiotic drugs must be

20

tested and certified pursuant to regulations promulgated by

2?

the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to assure that

22

the drugs have such characteristics as identity, strength,

23

quality and curifcy as to insure their safety and efficacy

24

in use.

25

At first, antibiotics intended only for laboratory
8

1

use in sensitivity testing were exempted by regulations and the

2

batch testing requirements and that exemption applied to

3

commercial sensitivity discs, such as the Bacto-Unidisk, which

4

came into use in 1950, as the number of antibiotics began

5

to proliferate.

6

The exemption of sensitivity discs from the certifi”

7

cation requirement was terminated in a rule making proceeding

8

in 1960, in which regulations were adopted to require their

9

batch certification.

10

This is discussed in our brief.

The order adopting the regulations recited that

11

following numerous complaints by the medical profession, hospita Ls,

12

and laboratory technicians, the Food and Drug Administration

13

made an extensive survey of the conditions surrounding the

14

production and marketing of discs and found them unreliable

15

in their statements of potency, with resultant impairment

16

of their safety and efficacy.

17

It was therefore deemed in the words of the author,

18

"vital to the protection of the public health to adopt the

19

regulations requiring their batch certification."

20

The question in this case then is whether the

21

Secretary correctly interpreted the statute as authorizing

22

the application of the batch testing requirement to antibiotic

23
24
25

sensitivity discs, which brings us back to the interplay of
definitions in the statute.
The District Court was of the view that a literal

9

i

reading of the Act's definition of "drug”, on page two of our

2

brief, and particularly the language in sub-part B of the

3

definition, " Articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure,

4

mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease...’5, the

3

District Court was of the view that this language clearly
%

6

has application to the sensitivity discs, but, despite this,

7

and despite the fact that drugs are contained in the article,

8

again in the words of the District Court, the District Court

9

decided that the Act should not be interpreted as including

10

sensitivity discs as drugs, because no part of this article

11

is administered to man or other animals either internally

12

or externally and its sole function is to provide medical

13

doctors with information for use by them as guidelines.

14

The Couart of Appeals affirmed the holding that

15

sensitivity discs are not drugs within the meaning of the

16

statute, expressing the viewsthat the discs only aid the

17

physician to determine what antibiotics to use for the

18

cure, mitigation or treatwat of the patient's disease.

19

And, in the v/ords of the court, that it was not the

20

legislative intent to apply the phrase, ’’intended for use in

21

the cure, mitigation, treatment..," et cetera, in such an

22

indirect manner.

23
24
25
<

Neither court cited any legislative history in
support of this interpretation of the statutory definition.
We believe first that it is clear on this record

10

1

and in the District Court finding that batch testing of

2

antibiotic sensitivity discs serves the Congressional purpose

3

expressed in Section 507 of assuring the safety and efficacy

4

of antibiotic therapy.

5

The role of the discs in therapy is adequately

6

described in the claimant's own printed enclosure packaged

7

in the cartons of Bacto-Unidisk, which is reproduced in our

8

appendix on page 182.

9

It says that "Bacto-sensitivity 'discs and Bacto-Unidisks" —•

10

only the latter are involved here — "are standardized paper

11

discs containing known amounts of the more commonly employed

12

antibiotics," et cetera. "They are recommended as a rapid

13

14

determining the relevant sensitivity of microorganisms to these

15

therapeutic agents.

16

valuable in selecting the drug effective against chronic

17
18
19
20
2!
22
23
24
25

Bacto-sensitivity discs are especially

or persistent infections refractory to primary therapy."
The testimony in the case explained the test is
medically important because there are various strains of
the same general group or type of infecting organisms, such
as staphylococcus, and there are differences among these
strains in their sensitivity and resistances to various
antibiotics.
The claimant argues that it is somehow significant
that treatment with an antibiotic frequently is begun

11

?

before the results of the test are known, but that does not

2

disprove the discs play an important role in antibiotic

3

therapy.

4

with tiio claimant's printed representation, that as a result

5

of tests with the discs the treatment is sometimes switched

6

from antibiotic to another and this is particularly true in

7

the critical situations in which a patient is not responding

8

to the primary therapy.

9

page 23 of our brief.

10

The testimony unequivocably shows, consistently

We collected those references on

Another factual consideration that is important to

11

this point in ray argument also is indicated in the claimant's

12

printed enclosure in the Bacto-Unidisk, this time on page

13

185 of the appendix, the little chart in the middle of that

14

page shows that a difference in the concentration or potency

15

of the antibiotic on the discs can make a difference as to

16

whether a zone of inhibition will appear at all in the tests

17

and not merely a difference in the size of the zone.
Because of this, discrepancies in disc potencies

18

19

can cause misleading test results and leave physician to

20

precribe the wrong antibiotic for his patient.

21

explained at the trial in the testimony of Dr. Joseph Truant,

22

Chief of the Bacteriology Section of the laboratory in

23

Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on page 83 of your printed

24

appendix.

25

This was

After complaining of the discrepancies his hospital

12

1

had found in discs, prior to the certification requirement,

2

Dr. Truant explained in the last two paragraphs on page 83,

3

"There is a possibility of having too low a potency in that

4

disc, too low a concentration, in which case the organism would

5

tend to be repozted out as being a resistant one, or being

6

more resistant, than if the true potency were in the disc.

7

"And on the other hand, you might have too high a potency,

8

which means that you would report a sen sitive organism, which

9

in fact might not be in that very sensitive category.

10

"So it might be an error in either direction, which

11

would give us false readings and we would be giving misinfor­

12

mation to the clinician and he in turn, obviously, being

13

unaware of the situation as we would be would not treat the

14

patient properly.
"Therefore, we feel that we can't take this chance

IS
16

of using discs that are not certified.

17

hazard."

18

It to us is a real

Additional testimony to the same effect is summarized

19

on page 27 of our brief.

The point is that the whole legislative

20

purpose reflected in the batch testing requirement of

21

Section 507 and brought out in the legislative history

22

reviewed in our brief, the purpose of trying to assure the

23

patient will get the therapeutic benefit intended when

24

physicians prescribe antibiotic drugs for them, can be

25

defeated, regardless of how pure and potent the pills, capsules
13

1

and injections administered to the patient may be if because

2

of faulty discs the wrong antibiotics; are administered.

3

We believe that a proper respect for the Congressional

4

judgment requires that the issue of interpreting statutory

5

definitions in this case be approached with this background

6

in mind.

7

general principle that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is

8

broadly construed in accord with its purpose to protect the

9

public health, we think it is clear first, that the use of the

When this consideration is combined with the

!0

discs shown in this record is a use in the treatment of

1?

disease within the meaning of the statutory definition of the

12

drug.

13

The claimant argues that the use of the disc in the

14

course of the patient's treatment is too indirect a use to be

15

considered a use in the treatment of disease within the

18

statutory definition.

17
18

But this would mean that the discs are neither drugs
nor devices within the meaning of the Act, since the definition

19

of "device” uses precisely the same statutory language and

20

since the Act's protection against adulteration or misbranding

21

apply only to drugs and devices, the result would be that the pdbl:

22

would be utterly unprotected against any kind of mislabeling

23
24
25

or adulteration of the discs.

There would be no statutory

recourse for example, even if the discs were being marketed
with every antibiotic on them falsely labeled.
14

1

Nothing in statutory language or in the legislative

2

history requires such an absurd result, which would so

3

seriously endanger the public health.

4

The more substantial interpretative question presented

5

by this case in our view is the problem of distinguishing

6

the statutory definitions of drug and device,

7

3 of our brief.

8

almost identical and yet, the two definitions are expressly

9

mutually exclusive.

10

on pages 2 and

Their terms insofar as pertinent here are

The District Courtsecognized this problem and under­

11

took to solve it by limiting the statutory term "drug" to

12

what it believed to be the common medical usage of the word

13

drug outside the statute, as articles administered to man or

14

other animals, either internally or externally.

15

We believe that this is where the District Court went

15

wrong because this is inadequate as an approach to the

17

interpretation of this complex technical regulatory scheme

18

for the protection of the public health in which the Congress

IS

has provided its own definition of the term "drug" for the

20

purposes of the Act.

21

22

It is a statutory term of art to be interpreted in
a manner to effectuate the objectives of the statute.

23

In our view, Securities and Exchange Commission

24

against Ralston-Purina Company, in Vol. 346 U.S., is the

25

exemplary opinion of this court which alluminates the proper

15

1

approach to interpreting such a provision of a regulatory

2

statute, so as to accomplish the congressional purpose.

3

There in interpreting the statutory exemption from

4

registration for a private offering of stock, this court held

5

that because it was the congressional purpose to exempt

6

transactions as to which there was no practical need for the

7

statute's application, the interpretation of the exemption

0

should turn on whether the particular class of persons affected

9

needs the protection of the Act.
Applying this standard, the court held that the

10

11

company's offering of Treasury stock to its key employees was

12

a public offering subject to the provisions of the Securities

13

Act, because in the words of the court, "employees had not

14

been shown to be able to fend for themselves."
The same basic approach was recently taken by the

15
16

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in distinguishing

17

between the definition of drug and device in the statute

18

before us, in the case of AMP

19

cited in our brief and in which this court denied

20

in No. 86, this tern.

Inc. against Gardner, which is
certiorari

21

The court there looked to the px’actical consequences

22

in terms of the Act's differences in the requirements imposed

23

upon drugs and devices to determine whether the particular

24

article there at issue should be classified as one or the

25

other.

And the practical consequences of that difference

16

»t

1

in classification are restricted to a very few provisions of

a

the statute, in fact, at the beginning, when the definitions

3

first came into the statute, there was no difference in the

4

regulation of drugs and devices at all.

5

In our own case, the only significance of the

6

classification of the discs as either drugs or devices, is

7

that if they are classified as drugs the batch testing

S

requirement for antibiotic drugs will apply.

9

they will not.

And otherwise,

10

The scientific qualities of antibiotics which led

11

Congress to require batch testing are the same whether the

12

antibiotic is used for a pill, a hypodermic injection or as

13

a test to determine what pill or injection to administer.

14

And, as I have said, the record shows that the medical

15

need for assurance as to quality and potency exists whether

16

the antibiotic is used on a disc or in a pill or injection.

17

It is therefore manifest that the Secretary correctly

18

interpreted the Act to reflect the legislative purpose in

19

concluding that the discs are drugs under Section 20IG, subject

20

to the batch testing requirements of Section 507.

21

22

And accordingly we ask the contrary judgement of the
Court of Appeals be reversed.

23

If I may, I will save any remaining time for rebuttal.

ARGUMENT OF EDWARD BROWN WILLIAMS

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4
5

MR. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

court.
The chief effort of the government in its brief in

6

this matter and in its argument has been to create the

7

impression that all or most antibiotic therapy in the United

8

States is based on the sensitivity disc test of which we are

9

talking here today.

And, that unless this procedure, this

10

testing procedure, is controlled by the government through

n

certification of these discs, that the public health will be

12

endangered, the patient's life will be in jeopardy.

13

I shall come back to that.

We shall show you can

14

establish very simply that on the basis of the literature

15

cited by the government itself and on the basis of the testimony

16

at the trial and the Judge’s findings in the District Court,

17

that these efforts of the government simply do not hold water.

18

They won’t stand up.

19

Q

What do you mean?

20

A

I mean that there is no danger and I mean that

That there is no danger?

2!

the extent of basing of antibiotic therapy upon the disc test

22

is far more limited than the government would have us believe.

23

In fact, I might say right here since the question

24

has arisen, that in our brief, page 18, we refer to the figures

25

of the Medical Market Guide, which show that in 1967 77 percent

18

1

of the antibiotics sold in that year were purchased on

2

prescription or by physicians.

3

Now, it is obvious that only about 23 percent went to

4

hospitals, which as the government concedes are the place where

5

the tests are made in the hospital laboratories.

6

As Dr. Keefer, a witness at the trial, said, "I would

7

say from the total number of infections that doctors see and

8

treat, the sensitivity test is not used routinely."

9

There is a good reason.

That is, that the initial

10

therapy, the wide-spectrum antibiotic, which the doctor starts

11

before the test is ever begun — it takes 24 to 36 hours for

12

the test — is ordinarily successful because of the doctor's

13

experience and the information he is able to draw from other

14

sources.

15

It is after the fact that he looks at the test and

16

as Dr. Keefer stated and the court found: "The test is used

17

to confirm his judgment."

18
19
20

Now, I should like to make a few remarks, if I may,
about some of the statements made by my friend here.
There was a trial in the District Court, which lasted,

21

I believe, about three days.

22

distinguished witnesses.

23

about, at least most of them did.

24

They have been almost ignored by the government in this case.

25

They are not clearly erroneous.

There were quite a number of

They knew what they were talking

19

The findings were made.

There is no question about

1

that and there has been no contention that they are clearly

2

erroneous.

3

Q

Do they have to be?

4

A

I think they have to be in order to be reversed.

5

I think that is clear from your decision.

6

Q

Well the findings yes, but is—

7

A

I am talking about the findings.

8

Q

Is this all a factual question?
V

A

9

No, sir, it isn't at all a factual question.

Now, on the question of the application of Section 507,

10

11

the batch testing provision of the Act,

12

like the sort of thing rvhich lends itself to description as

13

a part

•

this doesn't look

\

of a batch.

To me, —

14

Q

As a part of what?

15

A

As a part of a batchP which is to be tested

16

by the government.

17

certainly means something with some homogeneity to it.

18

here, we have an entirely different sort of an article.

19

are eight different antibiotic substances —

20
21

22

Q

The term batch to roe, Mr. Chief Justice,
And
Here

The government says each of those eight carne

from a "batch".
A

Yes, sir.

They came from a batch which was

23

manufactured by a company which manufactures antibiotics which

24

are tested by the government under Section 507.

25

Q

They have already been tested?
20

1

A

They have been check tested I doubt not because

2

I can’t, conceive of a company who manufactures antibiotics

3

and sells them for medicine, manufacturing separate antibiotics

4

for use on these discs.
Q

5

That just wouldn't be good business.

If the only market for the manufacturer of the

6

antibiotics were the maker of this Unidisk, then as I under-

7

stand it, 507 would not require batch testing.

8

A

If the only market —

9

Q

That is a complicated question.

I understand

10

that the maker of this product here in issue is not the

11

manufacturer of the various antibiotics —

12

A

That is correct.

13

Q

— but gets them from somewhere else, some

14

other manufacturer.
Now, if this were the only customer of that manufacture r 9

then there would be no batch testing required of that

manufacturer under 507, is that right?

22

The government would require it because they

No, no, as I understand it they consider this

a drug.
But they would also consider the

antibiotic going into it a drug, because it would be a component

of a drug under the statute.

21

That would be the government's

Q

You started to say in answer to another question,

2

whether or not these had already been batch tested before they

were sold to the maker of the Unidisk»

you thought maybe or maybe not, because probably the

5

manufacturer would not have differentiated his various

6

antibiotics depending upon to whom he was going to sell them,

And you said, well,

I can'i conceive that he would.

There are in the

Sensitivity to a drug.

53

A

Yes, sir.

In this testing procedure which is

54

entirely a laboratory operation, never comes anywhere near

55

the patient, there are involved this device here, which is

16

called a sensitivity disc, which has antibiotic substances

17

on it, a Petri plate upon which is deposited agar, which is

58

streaked with an isolate from the patient.

19

with the isolate in it, is plciced this disc.

A

That is correct.

10

Q

And as I understand it from what Mr. Wallace

11

suggested, the antibiotics used to impregnate these little

12

things on this disc, are not taken from batches which have

13

been certified.

14
15

A

Is that correct?

I would assume that they are from batches which

have been tested by the Food and Drug Administration.

I thought Mr. Wallace told us that is one of the

He did say that.

Q

What does the record show?

There is nothing in the record on that.

problems.
I would assume differently.

The

antibiotic?

23

A

They want to test the disc.

24

Q

They don't want to test just the batches of

25

antibiotics used to impregnate these discs, they want to
25

1

take the completed discs and test them?

2

A

That is correct.

3

Q

And that I take it — I think that is what. Mr.

4

Wallace said — that except and whatever it is that

5

impregnates these discs, has gone through the certification

6

procedures, you can’t be sure that the role this disc is

7

supposed to perform can be properly performed.

Is that it?

8

A

That is the position.

3

Q

And at that time might have a deleterious

10

effect and consequence upon the patient who may be treated

11

by a result, because it is not impregnated with certified

12

batches, might come up with the wrong answer or no answer.

3

A

That is the position of the government.

4

Q

But do they claim there is something else that

5

needs testing besides the antibiotics that are used to

6

impregnate these discs?

7

the antibiotics because of contact with the disc which means

8

that the discs themselves, the impregnated discs, have to be

9

tested?

20
21

Is there something that happens to

Or would they be satisfied with testing the

antibiotics used to impregnate the?**?
A

The government thinks the discs themselves should

22

be tested because they have found that the public health in

23

their mind will be endangered if they are not tested.

25

We have seen no evidence whatsoever of it.

Other discs which are being certified.
This is a different question.

12

those years, nobody came up with a single case of an erroneous

13

interpretation of a sensitivity test due to a faulty disc.
Nov; Dr. Truant, as my friend said, at the hearing, at

14
15

the trial, stated that he felt there was a danger to public

16

health involved.

on cross examination if he had had one single instance to

which he could point to show that the public health was

Are we supposed to second-guess the agency on

this kind of a judgment?

22

Do you really suggest that we make that judgment?

23
24
25

A

Whether public health is endangered?

This is not a finding made by the agency which

is binding on the court.

I am not asking any second guessing.

I am asking that the evidence be looked at.
27

It shov;s that

!

1

there is no such public health problem and furthermore, the

2

law is such that there is no basis,in my opinion, for holding

3

this article to be anything other than a drug, unless

4

possibly it were regarded as a device, because the definition

S

involved reads in terms of treatment of substances intended

6

for use in the treatment or diagnosis of disease.

Now it is quite obvious that treatment means treatment
of a patient and nobody can maintain that —

What about diagnosis?
Well, diagnosis was practically abandoned by the

government in the lower court as a ground for exposition.

12

13

They

But, Dr. Keefer made it quite clear, and he was,

14

perhaps I should say, the most distinguished witness at the

15

trial, he made it quite clear that there cannot be a diagnosis

16

of an infection without identification of the organism.

17

Obviously, the test doe3 not identify the organism.

18

Q

Has the agency at any time made any findings

19

with respect to why these discs qualify either under the

20

treatment or diagnosis?

21

A

They made a legal conclusion in the proceeding

22

which has been referred to, in the course of which the

23

regulations were adopted, they made a legal conclusion that

24

the discs were drugs.

Q

There has been no ruling on that.

11

A

No, sir, as far as I know.

12

Q

I take it though the government all but

13

concedes that the disc is also covered by the definition of

14

device.

15

Q

16

I read this dispute.

17

A

The government doesn’t even mention device as

I think the government's point was that the

18

language of the device section and 20Hi in the statute, the

19

language of the drug section 2Q1G, are quite similar, except

20

that 201G excludes devices from the definition of drugs.

an instrument or a contrivance.

Is there any doubt that that would be a drug?

diagnostic purpose?

5

Q

If it were applied to the human body for
No, sir.

So that the question here comes down to this,

as I understand it: This disc is applied not to the human body,

7

but is applied to a smear taken from the agar plate, from

8

a substance derived from the human body and it is done ir. the

9

laboratory and the question is:

10

Does that distinction remove

it from a category of a drug?
A

11

Yes, sir.

I should like to stress, Mr. Justice,

12

that treatment of a patient is the test of whether this is

13

used in treatment.
First, there is no treatment of a patient by this

14
15

device.
Secondly, it cannot be used in diagnosis because it

16
17

does not identify the organism.

18

can't diagnose unless you know what the organism is.
Q

19

That is perfectly clear.

You

In a sense it is used in treatment in the sense

20

that it is used for the purpose of determining the antibiotic

21

to be used in treatment.

22

suppose, it is used in treatment even though it is one step

23

removed.

24
25

A

In that sense it is arguable, I

It is used in a sense to determine the

antibiotic used in treatment under certain circumstances.

31

Q

1

May I ask you this, sir, if you happen to know.

2

There are various substances, things and what not, that are

3

used in the laboratory for the purpose diagnostic purposes,

4

to determine what the microorganism is.

5

as drugs?
A

G

No, sir.

Are those classified

There are several hundred, maybe

7

thousands, or laboratory tools of this nature which are used

3

in the industry and a clinical laboratory which have never

9

been classified as drugs and if this is classified as a drug

10

I can see no alternative to classifying all of these other

11

hundreds and thousands of articles.
Q

12

How about something like this* if there is such

13

a thing.

14

of application to human tissue a tubercular batch or whatnot.

15

Would that be classified as a drug?

16
17

Suppose in the laboratory there is used for purposes

What I am saying is that I am sure that if
injected into the person in the treatment of one form of

18

tuberculosis or another, it would be classified as a drug.

19

That is the fact that the substance is used solely in the

20

laboratory.

21

22
23
24
25

Remove it from that classification.

A

I believe so under this statute, Mr. Justice.

Q

You don't know of any cases?

A

I do not happen to know of a case, but the

line to be drawn here is whether or not it is used in the
treatment of diagnosis of a disease.
32

i
2

Q

I asked you a few moments ago if antibiotics

were drugs and you said yes.

3

A

Yes, sir.

4

Q

You said sulfadiazine was a drug. As I understand

S

it, antibiotics are put on each one of these spokes and

€

sulfadiazine.

7

there the same as if they hadn’t been put on there?

8

A

Why aren't they drugs when they are put on

I will tell you why, sir.

They are not drugs

9

because under the statute it is well established, there is no

10

doubt whatsoever, that an article is not a drug unless it is

11

intended for use in the treatment or diagnosis or prevention

12

or cure of disease.

13

Q

Well, that drug is, isn't it?

14

A

This is not.

15

Q

I am not ta3.king about this disc, I am talking

16
17
18

about the drugs that are put on it.
A

If this drug were used to wash a window, it

certainly would —

19

Q

It would still be a drug, wouldn't it?

20

A

No, sir, not under this statute.

21

Q

It wouldn’t be a drug?

A

Not under this statute.

22
23
24
25

It might be a drug in

some sense, but not under this statute.
Q

This is used in diagnostic purposes?

A

No, sir, it is not, because it does not identify
33

1

the organism and without identification of the organism there

2

cannot be diagnosis.

3

Q

Is it the government’s theory that when you do

4

this it does not give you a correct answer and you may give

5

a man this drug on the false assumption that he is not

6

sensitive to it.

7

A

That is their contention and I obviously don't

8

have time to go into my

from the literature and from the trial that there are so many

built-in protections against the sort of thing the government

argument, but it is quite clear

Q

Whether it is a little or much, I wouldn't want

him to rely on it at all. What they say is the case.
A

In my opinion, it isn’t the case.

It was the opinion of Dr. Truant, wasn’t it?

A

Yes, and I asked Dr. Truant for some kind of

specifics on that point and he could give me none.
Q

Should we wait until they know someone who has

died from the use of this before they pass a valid judgment
for the government?
A

After 16 years, Mr. Chief Justice, I should think

something would have occurred if it were going to.
Q

Well, maybe you would think so, but the

34

1

government through its research might think differently and

2

should we hazard the health of the public by saying this isn't

necessary.

4

A

The government through its research has come up

5

with nothing.

from the literature provided by the government itself.

That is demonstrable, that is demonstrated in

Q

Do you say that this disc is not a device either?

9

A

I say that if it is anything it is a device.

10

Q

11

Does it have to be one or the other, either a

drug or a device?

12

A

No, sir.

13

Q

Do you say it is neither?

14

A

I say it is realistically under the statute

15

it is neither, but if it is anything, it comes more nearly

16

being an apparatus or an instrument than it does —■
Q

17

To be a device under the statute it has to be

18

used for the diagnosis or treatment of a disease just like

19

the drug.

20
21

A

That is correct.

And if it were used for that

it would be more likely to be a drug.

22

Q

You say it isn't used for that, so it can't

23

be either.

24

A

25

I would like to conclude by saying that the literature

That is my position, yes.

35

1

cited by the government, which is in the record entirely, was

2

never even mentioned at the trial, shows clearly that if a

3

laboratory, as all good laboratories do, sets up the proper

4

standards of zone sizes for the various antibiotics, that

5

that laboratory and any other which does that will have no

6

problem with the zone sizes which seem to trouble the

7

government„

8
9

That is very clear from many of the articles cited
by the government itself.

That is true, regardless of whether

10

they are certified and it might be added that even under the

11

government's certification regulations the claimed potency,

12

that is, the potency claimed on the label of the disc may

13

vary from 67 to 150 percent in the device itself, or the

14

sensitivity disc itself.

15

In other words, you can be from 67 to 150 percent

16

off and still get these discs certified.

17

the lowest and the highest discs being tested by the government,

18

you can go as far as 250 percent off.

19
20

In fact, as between

Now, that kind of system is hardly conducive to the
kind of allying of fear, which the government wants here.

2!

I see my time is up.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACEON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

36

1

MR. WALLACE:

I want to clarify that our position is

2

that under the statute it would, be entirely fortuitous if

3

this disc if not a drug, whether or not the powders put on

4

the disc were batch tested, the statute would not require

S

that they be batch tested, but our position goes beyond that

6

and we say that regardless of whether those powders are batch

7

tested the disc itself needs to be batch tested to assure that

8

the proper potency and the proper amount of the powder is

9

impregnated on each of these discs and that it will diffuse

10

properly for the task and that the labeling is correct on the

11

disc.
That would not be accomplished by batch testing of

12

13

the powders themselves.
Q

14

Let me get this clear, now.

I gather the

15

government does not claim that whatever was used to impregnate

16

these discs was not batch tested and indeed, they may well

17

all have been batch tested.

18

A

That may be.

19

Q

But the government feels nevertheless these

20

should be given other tests.
A

21

22

25

The discs themselves should be subjected to

the batch testing requirement.

That is correct.

The paper on which these antibiotics are contained

23
24

Is that right?

is merely that, a container, the paper plays no part in the
test.

It is just a convenient way of getting these

37

1

antibiotics into the culture that has been drawn from the

2

patient.

3

And I think it should be properly looked at that

4

way.

5

functually, so as to afford the public the protections of

6

the statute that are scientifically pertinent to the characteris­

7

tics of the article at issue and to the medical use for which

8

it is intended.

9

We believe that it is correct to interpret this statute

Dr. Truant himself, while he could not recall a specific

10

example, did recall the number of instances of false results*

11

that had been brought to his attention by individuals in the

12

infectious disease department.

13

challenge made to the record that was developed in the rule

14

making proceedings in which the Food and Drug Administration

15

determined on the basis of complaints from laboratories that

16

the disc had proved unreliable and that there was a medical

17

scientific nee2 for baton testing.

But in addition, there is no

We will recess.

entitled matter was concluded.)
