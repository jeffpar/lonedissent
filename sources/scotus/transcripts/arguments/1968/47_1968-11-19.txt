CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Case Number 47, Walter R„ Foster

2
versus California.
3
ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. MADDY, ESQ.
4
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
3
MR. MADDY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court?

6

This matte ." is before this Court on the writ of certiorari to

7
the 5th District Court of Appeals in California limiter? to the
8
question of whether the conduct of a police line-up resulted in
9
the violation of the Petitioner's Constitutional rights.
10

We male two contentions; that the personal confrontation
11

between the Petitioner, Walter Foster, and a witness to an
12
armed robbery unnecessarily was suggestive and condusive

to

13
irreparable mistaken identification.
14

This

15

?a.s a violation of Mr. Foster's rights under due

process of law.

16
The second point is that the personal confrontation between
17

Mr. Foster and the witness violated the privilege against self­

13

incrimination.

The first issue is based in Stovall vs Denno as

19

decided last year by this Court with the other lineup decisions,
20
United States vs. Wade and Gilbert vs. California.
21

I might point out that Foster's trial and the decision in

22
23

the 5th District Court of Appeals resulted in a conviction.
This occurred prior to the decisions in Stovall, T'Tade and

24
Gilbert.

1

To properly pursue the due process question, I wish
2
to review the events in the case.

The crime charge was armed

3

robbery of a Western Union office in Fresno in January, 1966.
4

The victim was the late-night manager.

He was the only-

5
witness to the robbery? a man by the name of Joseph David.
6
He testified that two men enterred the office shortly
7
after midnight on January 25, 1966, and after appearing to
8

make out a money-gram, approached him at the counter with guns

0
pointed at him and handed him a holdup note.
10

He described these two men as one tall d/ndividual

n
dressed in coveralls with a hat pulled down over his face and
22
visible under the coveralls, a black leather jacket.
13
The shorters of the men was dressed,as he described,
14

in casual clothes and a suitcoat.
15

The men, after handing the holdup note to him,
16

required him to open the safe and a money box, to hand the
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

money to the taller man at which time the taller man left the
office.

The shorter man stayed three or four minutes later,

making certain threatening gestures to the witness.
Without relating in greater detail the facts of the
crime, I wish to point out the significance of certain items.
First of all, the short time that the tall individual, as
indicated in the record, was in the office.

Third is the fact that the witness changed the

8

descript ci of the coloring of the tall individual at the time

1

of the tila] because, as he indicated, the background of the

3

office was such that he had to make this change at the time of the

9

trial.

10

A 1.1 these points go to the one fact that the witness

3!

had litti e • nance for observation of the individuals that

12

robbed tie office that evening.

13

As pointed out in the Wade decision, Mr. David was

14

a likely susoect for prompting or for the effects of an

lineup.
I mentioned that the witness ultimately described or

stated that the tall individual was Walter Foster.

4

and Grice in this robbery.

5
6

California Penal Code Section 1111, which appears in
Appendix B

of the Respondent’s brief, requires corroboration

7

of an accomplice's testimony.

Now, the situation that this placed

3

the police in at the time they received the statement by Mr.

9

Clay was that they had one man, one participant in the robbery.

10

They knew who the second one was or they felt they knew who the

51

seoond ore was and, as we pointed out, Mr. Foster was a likely

12

man for the police.

13

had was to have Mr. David identify Mr. Foster, since he was the

14

lone witness.

He had a previous record.

The problem they

The other two men were shorter men, 5 foot 5 to 5 foot 6.

In evaluating this lineup in terns of the consideration
outlined in Wade, we would have to say that Foster; one,, was a
lone tall suspect.

He

was the only one wearing clothes

similar to those which were allegedly worn by one of the men

who robbed the Western Union office.

8

outlined in Wade, are part of the problems in lineups and part

9

of the problems of the police making suggestive factors available

10
21

Both of these things, as

to the witness at the time of the lineup.
Now, assuming that the witness gave a description of

I will note the case of Grume vs Beto, 383 F 2nd 36,

14

which presented a similar situation insofar as isolating an

15

individual from a lineup at the request of one of the witnesses.

16

Now, the Court there looked at the situation and

17

stated that this is very well a situation that violates due

18

processes to co this, to pull the man out, to suggest to the

19

witnesses that this is the man.

20

the Crume case was the fact that there the witness said:

very well would not have been due process.

hhe Respondents indicate this is a situation where we

'30

31

have just had a super cautious witness.

I think the record

12

clearly shows that it is a situation where the witness could not

13

identify t u individual who was there until forced upon my by

■Tow, if it please the court, we contend that each step

taken by the police and prosecution can be criticized as

suggestive and unfair and pointed to Foster.

is the scuimlcvtive effect of each of these three steps.

I think that one other aspect of this is the question

22
23
24
25

of necessity or as pointed out in Stovall vs. Deno, by Justice
Brennen, that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the
lineup.

Tie Respondents seem to tie this question

of

totality of circumstances with the harmless error rule and
ask the Court in their brief to review all of the facts of the
case whiel deciding the due process issue.
We think this should be the events and circumstances
surrounding the lineup alone, what prompted the action of the
police to bring about the lineup as they did.
In Stovall vs. Demo there was a dying witness who
brought about the single suspect confrontation.

That single

suspect confrontation was criticised but it was said under the
circumstances there was not undue process.
Under United States vs, Simmons, it was said that the
suspects were at large and there was a need for the use of
photographs.
In People vs. Ford and State vs. Sears there were
situations of

on-the-spot apprehensions of individuals

suspected of crime and on-the-spot identification which again
are situations, I believe, which are involved in the total
circumstances surrounding the circumstances.
When the lineups were considered as a whole, they

This is one of the dangers, so it was necessary to

present the linetips to the jury under cross-examination and

they were presented to the jury on a liminted extent.

22

Q

Is it your position that even though Clay identified

23

Foster at the trial as the man with him, California rule is

24

that there must be corroboration and the State offered David

25

as the corroborating witness?

That is correct.

3

and that David presented that.

4

Q

And you claim that there was an infirmity in his

identification testimony which entitles you to a reversal?
A

That is correct.

of the police.

introduced by Clay or by the prosecution.

That is correct.

it is significant insofar

as the question of harmless error.

We feel that this Court

18

must look at the procedures set forth insofar as the

19

events and circumstances cf the line up, to decide whether or

20

not the lineups were so suggestive and, as

21

to mistaken identification,"that they violated Poster's rights

22

of due process; of law.

j said, "conducive

Once that is conci^ered, we feel that is a basic

23
24

right as indicated in Chapman vs. California and would require

25

reversal.

However, if the Court thinks the rest of the facts
-

11-

of the Casa can be looked at to determine whether denial of due
process was contributive to the conviction» then we point to
the fact that Number One,in the law of the State of California
was perhaps Clay's testimony never

would have been admissible

thus the State vould have had no case at that point.

And the

second point is, to determine whether or not the testimony of
David contributed to the conviction.

We point to the fact that

John Henry Grice, who was as fully implicated in this case as

]
Foster WcS„• by Clay, the only difference in the case between
Grice anc Foster was the "witness identification" and he was
acquit tec .
Q

Grice was acquitted and since he did not enter the

Western tni.cn office there was no identification testimony by
David.

There was simply Clay’s testimony, but there must have

been some corroboration or else there would have been a
directed acquittal.
A

To review the record, I seriously question whether

there was any corroboration.

The Court allowed the matter to

proceed to jury.
Q

Then the trial court did not understand the California

law the way you are telling us it is.
A

I would say that the trial court determined at that

time that there was some corroboration for Mr. Grice.

course of the holdup that, the witness, David, had talked to
the taller man in the group?

Yes, underneath the coverall.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. MADDY, ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. MADDY:

Just one or two comments on the statements

23

of Mrs. Maier.

First of all, in answer to two points concerning

24

discovery rules in California and concerning what Mr. David, the

25

witness, said at the time of trial, I think they are both

dangers involved with lineup situation.

Fisrfc of all, discovery

is not going to do the attorney any good except in the manner
that he can bring things out in cross-examination.

As an

attorney? yon are faced with a problem of how far you are going
to push on cross-examination because your first intent at that
time is to win your case at the time of trial.
You cannot try the case and hope for the prospect of
Mr. Foster to sit in prison two years to wait for a court such
as this to wait for the record to be established.

The

prosecution is not going to bring out all the events in the
lineup.

They are going to put a witness on the stand to say, as

Mr. David did? "I am positively sure that is the man as I see
him sitting here today."
The problem is, he made that identification before
he got to court.

I think the majority of the indications do

not show that the prosecution goes into higher lineups unless the
witness cannot say for sure at the time of trial.
refer back to the lineups.

He has to

I think the two points thatfthe

Respondent makes both point out dangers involved with the lineup
situation.
The second point I want to make is that Mrs. Maier
made reference to certain factors that should be considered by
the court in reviewing the lineups.

She mentioned, had the

witness seen the man before, was he seen in the custody of
-

32«

1

police before, did he know anyone in the lineup?

z

I contend that the second lineup was the most important lineup

3

here because all of the things she mentioned were violated in

4

the second lineup.

5

We felt and
,

As far as the composition of the second lineup is

6

concerned, it could have been perfect as far as light and

7

clothing of the witness, but the significant point is that Walter

3

Foster was the only man in the second lineup who was in the

9

first lineup.

!0
II

There could not have been any more suggestive situation
than that presented by the prosecution at the second lineup.

12

Q

Mr. Maddy, before you sit down, I would like to say

13

the

court appreciates your representation of this indigent

14

defendant.

15

and we believe that such representation is a public service.

which you have represented the interests of your State.

above-entitled matter were concluded.)
