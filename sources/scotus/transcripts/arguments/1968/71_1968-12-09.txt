ARGUMENT OF CHARLES L. GOWEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. GOWEN:

8

io

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

court:
The Presbyterian Church in the United States, the

ii

petitioner, is a hierarchy church, sometimes called the Souther:

'12

Presbyterian Church,

13

is the session, composed of ruling elders and the pastors of

14

local churches.

The first step in the church government

15

Next is the presbytery, which is composed of repre­

1G

sentatives of local chufches in a geographical area, and also

17

the ministers from those churches.

13

Under the form of government of this church, a pastor

19

of a local church is not a member of the local church, but is

20

a member of the presbytery.

21

Next is the Synod, which generally, but not always,

22

corresponds to State lines, and which is composed of represen­

23

tatives of the local churches together with the ministers in

24

the included presbyteries.

25

Next is the General Assembly, which is composed of
3

1

|

representatives of the presbyteries divided equally between

2 | ministers and laymen.

These also constitute the courts which

3

govern the church, the General Assembly being the highest court

4

in the denomination.,
In April of 1966, the congregation of two local

5
6

churches of this church voted to sever all connections with

7

and remove themselves from all ecclesiastical control, juris­

3

diction and oversight of the Presbyterian Church in the United

9

States, and so notified the Presbytery of Savannah,
The Savannah Presbytery then appointed an Administra­

10
11

tive Commission, under the laws of the church, with full

12

authority to act in the premises, and with special instructions

13

to visit the ruling elders of each church, the ruling elders

14

constituting the sessions which, as I have said, is the govern-;

15

ing body of the local churches,

|

After each elder in each church, save one, reaffirmed

IS
17

the action, and after the pastor of each church had reaffirmed

13

his renunciation of the Presbyterian Church in the United State

19

the Commission, by resolution — that is, the Administrative

20

Commission of the Presbytery — by resolution declared the

N

21

22

pulpit of each church to be vacant because the ministers had
severed all connection with the church, and assumed original
-

23
24
25

.

jurisdiction over these local churches in accordance with the
Book of Church Order, which is part of the record in this case,j
and declared the Commission8s intention to secure ministers to

provida regular services of worship in the sanctuaries of each

2

of the two local churches for those members who wished to

3

continue their membership and communion with the general church,

Does it say anything about property?

I don't think it says anything about the propert V P

but it does say who has the use and the right to occupy the

A

It is not in the printed record.

Q

Has it been quoted in the brief?

10

A

No? sir? it has not been quoted in the brief.

!1

Q

That is a rather important matter.

After all?

12

within the canon law of the church there may be some basis for

13

saying that the elders or bishops of that church? whatever they

14

were? had the right to the use and occupancy of the property.

15

Do you have some similar basis in church law as this?

16

A

The statement in the church law is that when a

17

local church ceases to function as a church? the property then

18

is within the jurisdiction of the general church.

19

is that these local churches ceased to function.

20

Our position

The finding of the Administrative Commission was that

21

one elder did not constitute a session? that there was no ses­

22

sion to govern the church and that it had no minister and

As you understand it, is that the basis for the

21

Whether the implication proceeded from the circum­

22

stances of acquisition or the church laws, I suppose, is not

23

clear.

24

nothing that would indicate that the implication arose from the

25

church laws rather than from the circumstances of the acquisition*

I know this far in my study of the case, I have seen

7

1

A

X think it was from the circumstances of the

2

acquisition, and also from the general policy of the church

that has existed for 100 years.

of the Presbyterian Church.

Two churches in Savannah,

Only two?

Yes, sir,

Is it over a religious matter?

Q

-

We think it is over religious matters.

Somethingabout

civil law

and civil disobedience,

The first one was a statement in some Sunday

School literature about civil disobedience.

The evidence was,

on the trial of the case, that the local churches didn’t: even
use the Sunday School literature and were not required to use
it.

There was also a statement by the General Assembly of the
9

1

church on civil disobedience as a final resort to secure indivi­

2

duals their rights»

3

That statement on civil disobedience is in the record >

4

The summation of it is on page 58»

3

mild statement of it»

6

civil disobedience as a measure of last resort to be employed

7

only in circumstances of otherwise irremedial need, and in the

3

exercise of which the whole concept of law is not denied but

0

affirmedi and to continue to support and regard with compassion

I think it is a relatively

It ends up by saying that it regards

i

10

those who practice civil disobedience when no legal recourse

11

has been left open to them and who act in Christian conscience

12

and allegiance to Almighty 'Jod„

j

13

Q

Was that submitted to a jury?

14

A

Yes, sir? it was submitted to a jury»

15

Q

And did the jury pass on that?

16

A

Yes, sir? the jury passed on it»

17

Q

How did they hold? that it was religious or not

A

They held that it was a departure from the tenets

18
19

religious?

20

and doctrines of the Presbyterian Church in the United States

21

as they existed in 1861, and as they existed in 1890, when

22

one of these local churches affiliated with it — that is,

23

civil disobedience — and the holding is apparently they adopted

24

the English rule that was rejected by this Court in Watson ver­

25

sus Jones, and said that you couldn’t change the doctrine that
10

1

existed in 1861, or th© time of the church affiliation because

2

they were bound by it,

3

Q

4

Did the State court decide in favor of the two

local churches?

5

A

They decided in favor of the two local churches,

5

Q

And they let them keep the churches?

7

A

Yes,, sir.

The Court made the statement that this;

a

statement on civil disobedience, a quote from the Georgia

9

Supreme Court, "is an absolute defiance of law and order and

10

is the road to anarchy,"
Q

11

In the holding that is before us, the on® that

12

appears on page 124 of the appendix, and the opinion of the

13

Georgia Supreme Court, it says, after saying that there is an

14

implied trust, the Court says, "We take the view that such a

15

trust is conditioned upon the general church's adherence to

IS

the tenets of faith and practice existing when the local church

17

adhered with it, and that an abandonment or departure from such

18

tenets is a diversion from the trust which civil courts will

19

prevent,"

20

j

Then it goes on to say that that abandonment or de­

21

parture doesn't have to be total, but it has to be substantial.

22

Is that th® issue before us?

23

[
;

A

That is the issue,

Our contention is that under

24

the First Amendment, as construed in Watson versus Jones, and

25

in Kedroff versus St, Nicholas Cathedral, that this Court has
11

i

held that under the free exercise and establishment clauses of

1

2

'

the First Amendment, that the civil courts do not have a right

3

to inquire into those matters, but those matters are for deci­

4

sion by the ecclesiastical courts.

5

That is the question and the issue, and we think it

5

has been disposed of by Watson versus Jones,

7

decided on constitutional grounds originally, but we believe

0

was raised to constitutional status by Kedroff versus St.

9

Nicholas Cathedral*

which was not

10

Q

You are not representing the two churches?

11

A

No, sir? I am representing the petitioner, the

\z

central church.

I

Who bought the churehe St?

13

Q

Who paid for the church?

14

A

The local congregations bought the churches and

15

paid for them.

16

Q

In whose name are they?

17

A

The title is in the local churches.

18

Q

The title is in the local churches?

19

A

Yes, sir.

And the decision of the court, and we

20

think correctly, was that when these local churches affiliated j

21

or joined the central church, that there was an implied trust

22

that their church property would be used for the purposes of

23

the denomination.

24
25

Q

So you rely upon the implied trust?

A

I think so.

I think I can more than show you

12

1

the specific provisions.

2

Q

Can you do otherwise, no matter what you may

3

show us?

4

the local, property law?

As the case comes to us, are we not precluded from

5
5

A

As the ease comes to you* I fchihk it is conclude 1

that there is an implied trust.

7

Q

That is right.

And 1 gather that that trust doe s

8

not result in your client taking these properties and circum­

9

stances because, as your Supreme Court said, your body has

10

departed.

11

A

12

Q

13

As they say, that defeated the trust.
REally, what is before us is just that element

of it, the source of the title.
A

14

Title isn3t involved.

The only Ithing that is

15

involved is the right to occupy and use, the same thing in­

16

volved in St. Nicholas Cathedral.
Q

17

IS

But in those two cases they found within the

ecclesiastical law itself the right to use the property.

19

A

I am sure that we can point out —■

20

Q

The Court of Appeals of New York found that.

21

A

The Court of Appeals in New York, in the Kedroff

22

case, which involved an act of the legislature which, in effect,

23

undertook to place the property in the hands of the American

24

branch

25

felt that

of the church rather than th© Moscow branch because they
th© Moscow branch had bean tainted by the Communist
13

1

government . that existed there and was not capable of managing

2

it.

3

The Court, held that they couldn’t do it because under

4

the rules of the church and under its practice in the orthodox

5

church, that they had the right to occupy the cathedral, al­

.ip*

'O

though the cathedral belonged to the local people.

7

any question but what they had the title to it, the State

Q

We don’t have any Communist question here, do

A

Wo, sir.

we?

1?

Well, I don’t, know? we do have the

12

Vietnam War, and we have a statement on faults.

13

things the local churches found fault with was an amendment to

14

the church constitution that authorised women to hold church

15

offices.

16

Q

That wouldn’t be communistic,

17

A

X wouldn't think so.

One of the

They also found fault with

13

the central church because the General Assembly refused to en­

1

dorse an amendment, to the Constitution of the United States to

20

overcome a decision of this Court dealing with bible reading

21

and prayer in the public schools,

22

Q

There was something also about foreordination,

23

A

The last one was a statement by the General

24

Assembly on for©ordination.

If you will read the statement

25

of the General Assembly on foreordination, it simply says that

14

1

in order fco be a Presbyterian,, you don8t have to believe that

2

certain people are condemned to everlasting death at the time

3

of their birth, and that that isn't necessary»

4

you can't believe it if you want to,

5

or it doesn't deprive the members of these local churches from

6

believing it if they wanted to„

7

want to believe that, I can still be a member in good standing

in the church»
Q

9
10

It doesn't say

It doesn't deprive you .

They simply say if I don't

Is there anything about predestination or just

foreordination?

11

A

Just "fore"»

12

Q

I was reading the other night where a man in

13

Scotland was tried for sedition and convicted.

14

advocating sufferage for women.

15

something very fundamental here»
A

16

His crime was

Maybe we are on the track of

We think that this Court has held that all of

17

these matters are matters for determination in the church

18

courts, or by the court itself, and not by the civil courts.
Q

10

Except for the implied trust, the property, whiq i

20

you think the State law is free to settle the property dispute

21

within the church»
A

22

No, I think this;

*
I think this Court has held

23

that the only duty of the civil courts is to take the property

24

in the way that the general church has decided that it should

25

go.

15
I

j

Q

So you don't rely on implied trust?

2

A

No, sir.

3
4

The Georgia Court held it and I think

it is in this case.
Q

When I asked you whether you concluded by the

5

holding of an implied trust, your answer to., me was no, you are

5

not in the determination here, of whether or not this is a

7

matter of church law, whether or not it is free of any authority

8

of the State.

3
10
11

A

I don't think the State Courts have a right to

determine where the property goes.
Q

It was true, wasn't it, that there was a pro™

12

vision in canon law that dealt with this problem, and you are

1.3

going to suggest that there is on© in the Book of Church Order.

14

Can you suggest what the provision is that you refer to there?

15

16

A

It is either 16.7(a) or 17.7(a).

The copy I havdii

had 16.7(a), but it is not identical with this one.

17

Q

I don't have (al’s and (b)'s in this one.

IS

Did you say that the civil courts are entitled to

13

interpret the ecclesiastical law and the canon law with respect

20

to property?

21

A

No, sir.

22

A

If you don't rely on implied trust, then it seems

23

to me the Court would have to follow church law to settle the

24

property, and if it can't do that either, then to dismiss the

25

case and leave it to a trier of strength.
