ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The question in this case, which is on certiorari from

11

the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit, is

12

whether the Federal Trade Commission correctly held that a

13

sales commission plan by which the respondent Texaco dis­

14

tributed, promoted and sponsored the sale of tires and auto­

15

motive accessories made by the respondent Goodrich Tire and

16

Rubber Company, promoted and sponsored the sale through the

17

Texaco service stations in return for a commission paid to

18

Texaco by Goodrich — whether the Commission properly held

19

that this constituted an unfair method of competition in vio­

20

lation of section 5 of the Trade Commission Act.

21

The respondent Goodrich also had a similar sales

22

commission plan with the Firestone Tire and

23

but I will focus primarily on. their relationships with Goodrich,

24
25

ubber Company,

This case is one of three companion cases that the
Commission instituted in 1965 challenging the sales commission
2

1

method of distributing tires, batteries and accessories, and

2

each of tiese cases named as a respondent a major oil company

3

and a major tire company.

4

In each case, after protracted proceedings, the

5

Trade Comiiission held that the sales conurdssion plan was an

6

unfair method of competition and ended a broad cease and desist

7

order which prohibited each of these companies from engaging in

8

this type of plan.

9

At the end of the 1964 term, this Court upheld the

10

Commission's order directed against the plan involving Atlantic

11

Refining Company, and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.

12

Subsequent thereto, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

13

Circuit upheld the Commission's order directed against the

14

plan involving the Shell Oil Company and Firestone.

15

Now, while those two cases were going through the

16

courts, in the present case the Texaco-Goodrich case, the Court

17

of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, on a prior

18

appeal, set aside the Commission’s order.

19

a petition for certiorari in that case, and a week after this

20

Court decided the Atlantic case in favor of the Commission, it

21

vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and, in effect,

22

remanded the case to the Commission with directions to recon­

23

sider it in the light of that.

24
25

The Commission filed

Upon such reconsideration, the Commission issued a
new opinion in which it again, in the light of the Atlantic
3

1

case , concluded that this sales commission system was an unfair

2

method of competition and entered a cease and desist order the

O

same as the order that had been upheld by this Court in Atlantic:

4

Once again the Court of Appeals set aside the Commis­

5

sion's order and directed the Commission to dismiss the com­

6

plaint.

7

Now, the economic relationship that exists between

8

the respondent Texaco and its retail gasoline service station

0

dealers is basically the same as that presented to this Court

10

,

in the Atlantic case.

11

Q

Except in the Atlantic case there was coercion.

12

A

I am speaking of just the economic relationships,

13

the first element, between the company and the dealers.

14

come in a moment and explain the differences in the way in

IS

which the power was exercised.

16

I will

Texaco is one of the largest petroleum dealers in

17

the country.

It distributes its products to 30,000 service

18

stations, many more than involved in Atlantic, and, in fact,

19

this represents about one-sixth of all of the service stations

20

in the country.

21

These service stations operate on two bases:

About

22

40 percent of them are so-called lessee dealers who lease their

23

station from Atlantic, and the remainder are so-called contract

24

dealers who either lease their station from a third person or,

25

in fact, own the station.

1

The way in which the stations are leased here is the

2

same as basically in Atlantic.

3

under short-term leases, one-year leases, which permits termi­

4

nation by either side upon 10 days' notice, and the lease has

5

similar housekeeping clauses which provide for immediate can­

6

cellation if the lessee fails to comply with these situations.

7

In addition, in each instance, of course, the dealer

is completely dependent upon Texaco for its supply of gasoline,
and there, too, you have a yearly contract which is terminable
by the oil company on 30 days' notice.
The sales commission plan in this case was originally
entered into in 1940, and it was renewed in 1943.
Under the plan, Goodrich agrees to pay Texaco a 10
percent commission on all Goodrich goods sold through the
Texaco gasoline stations or from wholesale outlets, and this
payment, it is stated in the sales commission agreement, "is in
consideration of the aid to be given and the services to be
rendered by your sales organization in connection with promotinc
the sale of Goodrich products."
As I have indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart, I will
shortly come to what they did in carrying out this obligation
to promote the sale of parts.
Now, during the five-year period for which data is
in the record, 1952 to 1956, Goodrich and Firestone together
sold to Texaco $245 million worth of TBA under the plan, and

25
5

1

these two companies paid to Texaco in this period approximately

2

$22 million in commissions for the services that Tecaco per­

3

formed under the contract.

4

Now, in evaluating the Commission's decision in this

5

case, and in analyzing this Court's decision in Atlantic, the

6

parties have agreed that it may be appropriately broken down

7

into three elements.

3

the Commission’s determination of violation.

9
10

First, did Texaco have controlling economic power
over its dealers?
Secondly, in the performance of the sales commission

11

12

Three elements are necessary to sustain

contract, did Texaco exercise that power?

13

Third, was there an adverse effect upon competition?

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Friedman, you may con­

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The Court of Appeals in this case ruled that Texaco,

10

just as Atlantic, did have economic power over its dealers.

11

record shows that in this case the dealers the dealers, no less

12

in Atlantic, were completely dependent upon the oil company

13

for their economic survival.

14
15
15

I would like to correct something that I said earlier
on these leases.

I apparently misspoke myself.

The precise terms of the lease are that they run

17

from year to year, but they are automa.tically terminable 10

18

days before the end of the year.

19

20
2?

25

The

The gasoline contract similarly runs from year to
year and is terminable 30 days before the end of the year.
I don’t want to have any suggestion that they could
be terminated within the period of the yearly term.
Q

And they are terminable by either party?

A

Yes.

Q

As I understood the facts, many of these

7

service

1

station operators are lessees of Texaco, and a great many, or

2

some, are also lessees of other people, and some oim their

3

property?

4

A

That is correct»

Roughly 60 percent are either

S

owners of the property or lessees of third persons, and roughly

6

40 percent, about 13,000 out of 30,000, are lessees from Texaco

A

In their fundamental characteristics, these

9

agreements are the same»

They are short term.

They have the

10

housekeeping provisions and, of course, as this Court has noted

11

on several occasions, these gasoline station people are small

12

businessmen in every sense of the word.

13

They have what to them is a very substantial invest­

14

ment in their service station, and the service station itself

15

is a relatively expensive proposition.

As this Court correctly

pointed out, we think, in

17

Atlantic, as a result of all these disparities, these people

18

do not bargain as equals.

There is a tremendous disparity in

In these circumstances, understandably, the

antagonize their relationship with the oil company dealers.
Since the Court of Appeals has found in this case
and upheld the Commission’s determination that the oil company
has its economic power over its dealers, the txro remaining
issues in this case are whether the Trade Commission was
3

5

warranted in concluding in the light of the Atlantic decision

2

that what they did, what Texaco did in this case, in performing

3

the sales commission agreement, constituted an exercise of

4

that power, and also that in the result of such exercise, it

5

was an impediment to competition.

S

In approaching that problem, I think it is appropriate

7

once eigain to stress the limited nature of judicial review of

3

the Commission's determination that a particular practice is an

9

unfair method of competition.

10

This Court, in Atlantic, pointed out that where the

11

Congress has provided that an administrative agency initially

12

apply a broad statutory term to a particular situation, our

13

function is limited to determining whether the Commission's de­

14

cision was warranted on the record on a reasonable basis, and

15

it went on to say that while the final word is left to the

IS

Courts, necessarily you give great discretion to the Commission1 s

17

determination.

18

Q

Mr. Friedman, may I ask you at this point:

Is

19

there evidence in the record as to whether any of these sta­

20

tions handled TEA of other manufacturers?

21

22
23
24
25

A

Yes.

Q

Is there evidence as to how substantial that was!'

A

It is difficult to say.

that they did.

There is no question

In fact, the Examiner found that all of them

handled some TBA that was so-called non-sponsored, but the
9

1

evidence indicates that much of this handling of so-called non­

2

sponsor production was,, in fact, a so-called occasional pick-up

3

business.

4

If a customer came in and needed a couple of spark

S

plugs or tires, something of that sort, they filled it.

6

is no qualitative data in this record as to precisely what

7

percentage of the dealers or what percentage of total TEA

8

was sponsored.

9

There

But we do have the fact that over a 5-year period,

10

as I indicated, they sold a total of $245 million worth of

11

TEA through the Texaco outlets.

12

I would like at the very outset to point out that this

13

case in a number of respects is significantly different than

14

Atlantic insofar as the exercise of the powers concerned and

15

insofar as what the effects upon competition were.

IS
17

In the first place, we made no claim in this case
now that there was any coercion by Texaco of its dealers; that

18

is, the dealers were not threatened that they would have their

19

leases cancelled if they should handle competing products.

20

Secondly, we don’t have here what we had in Atlantic

21

the policing by the oil company of its dealers.

22

for example, receive information from the tire company as to

23

dealers to whom the tire company couldn't sell.

.24
25

They did not,

They didn’t

have these so-called phantom inspector's going around and check­
ing in that sense.
10

1

2

There is nothing here to show that Texaco pulled down
signs advertising competing products.

In addition to that,

3

unlike Atlantic, we don’t have here a dramatic shift in busi­

4

ness following the initiation of the sales commission.

5

In Atlantic, you will recall the tremendous shift in

6

business over a period of the year when the sales commission

7

plan was initiated.

8
9

We don’t have that here.

On the impact on competition, in Atlantic there was
an impact of three levels.

In this case, there is only an im­

10

pact at one.

1?

divided its operating territories between Goodyear on the one

12

hand .and Firestone on the other, and thus eliminated all inter­

13

brand competition between the two tire companies.

14

have that here.

15

In Atlantic, what happened was that Atlantic

We did not

Secondly, in Atlantic, the arrangement was that each

16

dealer was assigned to a special supply point.

17

chase from one source of Goodyear or Firestone.

18

effect, of course,'of eliminating all intra-brand competition

19

between dealers in the particular rubber company, such as Good­

20

year in competing for the customer of a single dealer.

21

He had to pur­
That had the

But what we do have here, and what the Commission

22

pitches .its case on, is the impact on compet ition upon the com­

23

peting suppliers of TBA? that is, the people who are competing

24

with Goodrich and Firestone to sell to the Texaco stations.

25

The Commission pointedly ruled that the differences,

11

‘i

the factual differences s. between this case and Atlantic were

2

immaterial, because it said that the Texaco sales commission

3

agreement, the words it used,

4

effect, is indistinguishable from the one held unlawful in

5

Atlantic.

6

in its fundamental operation and

The Commission interpreted this Court's Atlantic

7

decision, in effect, as follows:

It said that this Court ruled

8

that while coercive practices aggravate the restraint imposed

9

by the. sales commission plan, it is the oil company's power ovei

10

its dealers, derived from the contractual relationship between

11

them, and the utilisation of that power through the performance

12

of the promotional services required by the sales commission

13

agreement, which renders the sales commission plan unlawful.

14

In other words, the Commission held here, as this

15

Court, we think, recognized in Atlantic, that the basic vice of

16

the sales commission plan, was the utilization of economic power

17

in one line, the gasoline market, to restrain competition in

18

another market, the TBA market.

19

We think that the Commission properly drew that con­

20

clusion here because Texaco no less than Atlantic, we think,

21

brought its economic power over its dealers to bear in a way

22

that gave the Goodrich Company and the Firestone Company a com­

23

petitive advantage over other sellers of TBA in selling to the

24

important segment of the TBA market that was represented by

25

these numerous Texaco service stations which are located

12

1

basically throughout most of the country»

2

The Commission summarized at considerable length

3

how Texaco had used its economic power in the performance of

4

the sales commission contract» I will refer to six instances»

5

The first thing is that even before the dealer was

6

signed up as a dealer, the Texaco people stressed to him the

7

importance of carrying an adequate stock of TEA, and also urged

8

upon him to select either Goodrich or Firestone.

9

select one of these two sponsored brands, Texaco takes the

tQ

initiative and introduces him to the representative of the

11

rubber company.

If he does

12

Before the station is actually opened, Texaco fre­

13

quently informs either or both Goodrich and Firestone of the

14

opening of such station, although the record does also indi­

15

cate that in many instances the rubber companies were aware of

16

this themselves and made the first sales pitch.
Texaco actively participates in the promotion campaigns

17
18

of Firestone and Goodrich.

They have various dealer meetings,

19

they have training courses.

At those courses, the sponsored

20

products are frequently used for training and display purposes

21

and, in addition to that, representatives of the rubber com­

22

panies frequently attend these meetings.

23
24
25

Q

What form does that, advertising take, Mr. Fried­

A

It varies again.

man?

6

material.

There is evidence in the

But we think, as I shall show, that this is really im­

The critical thing is that they did play a very active

1
8

role in promoting the sale of the sponsored products to their

9

dealers.

10

Finally, the Commission said, perhaps most effective

11

of all, the Texaco salesman continually carries the message in

12

his day-to-day contacts with the dealers.

13

is important to remember that these Texaco salesmen who are

14

most directly involved in pushing the sponsored TBA products

IS

also play a critical role in the annual dealer valuations and

16

in the determination of whether the dealer's lease and con­

V/

tractual relations with Texaco are to be renewed.

18

In this regard, it

The Commission concluded that the consequence of

19

these promotional efforts by Texaco was to impress upon Texaco

20

dealers through constant repetition and in a variety of ways

21

that Texcico, whose favor the dealer must court, has a strong

22

interest in their purchase of the sponsored products.

23
24
25

The record in this case indicates that although
Texaco did inform its dealers that they were independent busi­
nessmen who had the freedom to select whatever brand of TBA
14

1

they wanted, in fact the performance of this contract, its

2

recommendation, its promotion, its sponsorship of the Goodrich

3

and Firestone products, did put competing distributors of TEA at

4

a very definite disadvantage in selling to Texaco outlets.

5

The Commission called 31 witnesses who were represen­

6

tatives of competing wholesale sellers of TEA.

7

testified basically as to the difficulties they had in selling

8

to Texaco outlets.

9

were outlets to whom they couldn't sell at all.

These witnesses

18

They testified as to numerous instances

Then they testified to some instances, not too many

\7

admittedly, but a substantial number, in which the Texaco dealer,

18

explained that they were unwilling to purchase the competing

19

products because of the fact that they were told they had to

20

carry a sponsored brand.

21

I think the Commission fairly summarized this evi­

22

dence when it said at page 91 of Volume 6 of this little docu­

23

ment that we have here which contains most of the things, that

24

as a result, many Texaco dealers —* as a result of Texaco's

25

vigorous sales campaign to its dealers —- were left with the
15

I?

E

impression that Texaco would look with disfavor upon their pur­

a

chase of non-sponsored TBA products and that they were required

3 | to purchase the sponsored TBA.
4

‘'The practical effect of this program, I think, is

5

well brought out in the testimony of a man named Richard Tidwell,

6

which is set forth in Volume 2 of the recar’d.

Mr. Tidwell was

7 . an airline pilot who went into the service station business.
8

He was a lease dealer for two years and then left because he

9

wanted, to go back into flying.

10

He testified that when he was interviewed, they ex­

11

plained to him the advantages of TBA and recommended Goodrich

12

or Firestone, and he selected Firestone.

13

At a later point, he considered the possibility of

14

taking on a cheaper brand of tires.

15

at the top of tha page, he explained what happened.

16

At page 1211 of the record,
He said:

"I was thinking seriously about putting in a line of

17

the second cheaper brand of tires, and I explain this to

18

Mr. FifcE."

19

Parenthetically, he was a Texaco representative.

20

"He told me at that time, and I will say as much in

21

his words as possible, 'Dick, we cannot tell you not to

22

handle these tires, but we attempt to be more lenient and

23

look with favor on our dealers who are more loyal to us.8

24

As a consequence, I told him that I v/ould not handle the

25

tires."
16

1

Then down at the bottom of the page, Mr. Tidwell was

2

asked:

3

"Mr. Tidwell, why didn't you ever carry any other

4

brand of TBA in your station other than Firestone?"

5

At the top of page 1212 he said:

6

"When I found out that the Texas Company desired me

7

to carry only one line, I endeavored to work with them."

8

The same thought was repeated toward the latter part

o
%»

of page 1217 when Mr. Tidwell was asked why he asked for Mr.

10

Pitas's advice about handling these competing tires, and he said:
"I asked for two reasons.

11

One, I had confidence in

12

his judgment.

The other is if he had any objections, be­

13

cause I wanted to stay on good standing with the Texaco

14

Company."

15

Q

Who was that employee?

16

A

The employee was a Mr. Fitz, who had the posi­

17

tion of being manager of the Texaco bulk refinery in the area

18

where he was working.

19

dealt in negotiating his lease.

He was a Texaco official with whom he had

Indeed, it is rather difficult to understand why

20

22

| these two large companies would pay $22 million to the Texaco
?
Company if they didn't think that in return for this they were

23

getting some advantage that they could not have gotten through

24

their own sales efforts.

21

This Court in Atlantic pointed this out when it stated

25

17
i

II

1

that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that there would

2

have been little point in paying substantial commissions to oil

3

companies were it not for their ability to exert power over

4

their wholesalers and dealers, an ability adequately demon­

5

strated on this record.
The Court of Appeals , however, rejected the Commis­

6

7

sion’s finding that Texaco had exercised economic power basic­

8

ally on two grounds.
First, the Court said at page 112 of this little sixtlr

9
10

volume of the appendix, a finding of coercion is a threshold

!1

requirement of a determination of exercise of dominant economic

12

It is simply to benefit the suppliers?

10

A

I put it the other way, if I mays that the fact

11

that the suppliers were willing to pay the substantial amount,

12

it seems to us, is a pretty clear indication that the suppliers

13

felt that in the performance of these agreements, Texaco was

14

giving something that they could not obtain themselves through

its economic power.

satisfactory to both Goodrich and Firestone.

20
21

22

What I do suggest is the basic reasoning and rationale

I would like to also add, Mr» Justice, that in the
Firestone case, the Fifth Circuit held that the absence of
coercion was not there.

In other words, the Fifth Circuit did

23

not hold this Court's opinion in Atlantic that even without

24

coercion, nevertheless the Commission might condemn this system

25

Q

Would you agree, however, that -they have to show
20

1

something more than the mere existence of economic power?

2

A

You have to show some exercise of the power.

3

Q

You have to show the use of economic power to

4

favor Firestone and Goodrich in this case.

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

And you believe that that is evidence in.the

7

8
9

findings below?
A

The findings of the Commission; yes.

We think

what they have done here, while not as much obviously as they

30

did in Atlantic, nevertheless is enough to warrant the Commis­

11

sion in concluding that this had a sufficiently significant

12

impact on competition.

13

Q

Certainly if you showed nothing more than the

14

lease arrangement between Texaco and the stations, the mere

15

fact that Texaco receives a commission from the tire companies

16

would not be enough, would it, if that is all the record shows?

17

A

That may be, Mr. Justice, if that were all the

18

record shows.

i3

Here we think they did fully perform their obligation under

20

the sales commission contract to promote the sales of TBA.

21
22
23
24
25

We think the record here shows a good bit more.

As I say, they performed the obligation in a suffi­
ciently satisfactory manner to the oil companies that they
were willing to pay a substantial amount.
Q

You think that promotional activity with the

stations standing alone would be enough to constitute the
21

necessary use of dominating economic power?

Yes, the promotional activities would be.

is basically what the Commission held.

4

Q

And that is all there is in this case?

5

A

That is right.

6

It is the promotional activities

plus, of course, the effect on competition.

7

Q

I mean, that is all Texaco did?

8

A

That is right.

That

They promoted the contract in

the context of their economic relationship.

Q

And you say that is the exercise of power?

11

Yes o

12

touch o

A real clubbing as distinguished from the gentle

13

toother aspect of the Court of Appeals decision is

14

that the Court of Appeals seems to think, and we, of course,

15

disagree, that thi3 Court in its Atlantic decision defined the

16

precise limits of the Commission's power to condemn sales com­

17

mission plans.

18

Then they reviewed all of the acts that Texaco had

19

done, lined them up against the acts that Atlantic had done,

20

and said "These are significantly different," and, therefore,

21

concluded that the Commission could not treat this as an exer­

22

cise of the economic power of Texaco.

23
24
25

Again, we think that is not what Atlantic held.
Atlantic merely decided on the facts before it that the Commis­
sion was justified, and we think the Courtof Appeals here has
23

1

approached to review the Commission8s order in the wrong way.

2

It seems that what the Court of Appeals should have done is

*:;■

not to look and say "Is this case on all fours with Atlantic?"

4

It should have said that despite the differences between this

5

case and Atlantic, was the Commission justified in concluding

6

that» nevertheless, this sales commission system did constitute

7

a sufficient exercise of power and did have a significant im­

8

pact on competition to warrant condemning it?
This brings me to the third element of the equation,

9
10

if you will,

the effect of this plan on competition.

In the Atlantic case, this Court recognised that the

11
12

basic impact of the sales commission plan upon competition

13

was comparable to a time arrangement? that is, in each case the

14

person who is doing the purchasing felt constrained to exercise,

15

to make his choice, not on a competely free basis, but upon

15

some feeling that he had to satisfy the. oil company.
It, therefore, concluded that in determining the im­

17
18
19

pact on competition, it was appropriate to apply in this area
a standards that had been developed in earlier cases? that is,

20

it is enough to show that a not insubstantial amount of com­

21

merce was affected and it was unnecessary for the Commission

22

to make a lengthy, protracted analysis of the market.
In the Atlantic case, the total amount of sponsored

23
24
25

TBA'

that was sold over a 5-year period under the sales commis­

sion agreements between Atlantic and Goodyear and Firestone was

24

1

slightly over $50 million over a 5-year period.

2

in one year, last year, 1956, total sales were approximately

3

$58 million.

4

in this case were almost five times Atlantic; that is, $245

5

million as against $50 million in Atlantic.

6

In this case,

Over the 5-year period, the total sales involved

And, of course, when a not insubstantial volume of

7

commerce is tied up this way, the effect on competition is

8

enough even though not all the dealers were tied up, even

9

though many of the dealers handled competing products, and

10

even though many of them didn't handle sponsored products at

11

alio

12

The critical thing, we think, from this record, is

13

that the effect of the Texaco sales commission plan had been

14

effectively to fence off from a substantial segment of the TBA

IS

market represented by Texaco dealers competing sellers of TBA.
There are two other factors involved in considering

16
17

the impact on competition that I think are appropriate to men­

18

tion.

19

When the Commission decided this case on remand, it

20

already had decided the two other TBA cases.

21

studying these three cases, it had learned a great deal about th«

22

TBA industry.

23

course of these three cases was that only the very large tire

24

companies are able to have these sales commission plans.

25

In the course of

One of the things that had been disclosed in the

It also is clear that the service stations, by their

25

nature, are becoming increasingly important outlets for the

distribution of TBA.

to the competing manufacturers of TBA, the smaller manufacturer?

4

who are not able to enjoy these sales commission plans, that

we eliminate the restraints on access to the market that these

plans represent.

Thus, it becomes more and more important

In the Atlantic case, this Court referred to the de­

7
8

structive effect on commerce that would result from the wide­

9

spread use of these contracts by major oil companies and sup­

10

pliers.
This is not wholly theoretical, because we do have in

n
12

this case the evidence that a small battery manufacturer in Tex­
as had great difficulty in selling to the Texaco outlets.
In addition, there is a further anomaly in this situa­

Court:
When in 1965, following the Court’s decision in
Atlantic, Your Honors remanded this case to the Commission for !

17

Atlantic, it was perfectly plain that, as it is now, Texaco

is a large company engaged in the sale of petroleum products

student Mr. Friedman argued Atlantic.

year — “did in this case would not have the same adverse effect
on the competition as the plan the Commission condemned.”
He repeatedly, in response to questions from the
Court, disclaimed a per se theory of the illegality, and no
claim of per se unlawfulness was made in the Government's brief
in Atlantic.
More importantly, Mr. Justice Clark's opinion does
not hold that the mere existence of superior economic power in

28

1

the oil company, vis-a-vis its dealers, results in illegality.

2

The opinion makes clear that the gravamen of the violation con­

3

sists of the misuse of that power with concomitant anti-competi­

tive results.
In a nutshell, the Commission's order in Atlantic

5

6

was upheld because the oil company, and I am quoting now from

7

Mr. Justice Clark, "marshaled its full economic power in a

3

continuing campaign to force its dealers and wholesalers to

3

buy Goodyear products,” and that rationale was precisely the

TO

one that the Government advanced in its brief to this Court.
Again I quote;

13

"In sum, Atlantic marshaled the full

12

measure of its economic power over its dealers to carry out a

33

pressure campaign designed to get them to handle Goodyear and

14

Firestone products, and because of the extent of that power, the

15

campaign was highly successful.”

factors before Texaco dealers buy non-sponsored products?

Whereiis the proof that Texaco dealers are constrained
to acquiesce in Texaco's recommendations?
I should have thought, Your Honors, that since the

18

dealers, it would have favored us with some words from the

19

patients themselves.

20

But the most amazing part of this new theory is that

Then in connection with this issue, the question seeks

similar matters.

In short, in this questionnaire, the Govern­

The first Commission simultaneously with

the issuance of orders against Atlantic and Shell, held that

12

this record was not sufficient to warrant an order against

13

Texaco,, and remanded the case to the Hearing Examiner to go

14

into the question of anti-competitive effect, a critical factor ;

IS

which was lacking.

i

18
17
18

We tried to enjoin it in the courts because the very
anti-competitive effects which the Commission found lacking
were alleged in the complaint.

So the counsel for the Commis­

19

sion had ample opportunity, after several years of investigatior

20

and several years of trial, to prove these facts if he had them.

said he didn't have them; he couldn't prove them.

We went into court to enjoin the hearing.

The Commission

representative solemnly told the District Court and the Court
of Appeals that it had new evidence.
They offered nothing.

42

We came back for a hearing.

'i

What they did was violative of the law of evidence.

2

They took judicial notice of facts that were in the other record.

3

The Commission then said this wasn't proper and it has excluded

4

all of the remand evidence as improper.

5
6

So the record today is just as deficient now as it
was the first time it came before the Commission.
Our submission. Justice Fortas, is that assuming we

are a large company, assuming no anti“Competitive effects,

9

assuming that all that you have is that a larg ©amount of TBA

10

sponsored is sold, and assuming that we got a commission which

There is no discrimination.

If I may continue on this wholesaler testimony —

Do you mean they render the same service for

nothing to the non-sponsored people?
A

6

That is correct.

They do everything on the non-

7

sponsored that they do for the sponsored,, to help the dealer

8

be a good merchant.

9
10

Q

Then why do they pay you an enormous commission.

Because we are training the dealer to handle TBA

Q

If they can get it for nothing, why do they pay

you?

Q

They don't get the recommendation for nothing.

their testimony related, there was overwhelming proof that the

tised and openly displayed at their stations.

This concept of open display and advertising of non~

Q

I would prefer to stay with antitrust.

What did

the independent dealer have equivalent to the recommendation of
Texaco with its dominant economic power?
A

He had the fact that dealers are in very short

supply; that there is great competition for good dealers, and
47

1

that there is great economic loss if a station is closed down

2

because you can't get a dealer — and this is a perennial situa­

tion in this industry — and the economic loss by having a sta­

Q

Are these arrangements exclusive?

4

A

They are not exclusive, Your Honor*»

i
As a matter j

5

of fact, Texaico has similar arrangements, at the time this case

6

was tried 12 years ago, all over the country.

7

only one here who was in the case when it was tried.

8

had at that time arrangements with Firestone and with U.S.

of the oil companies have arrangements with a number of tire

companies.

Most;

There is nothing exclusive about this.

11

Q

Is that broken up on a regional basis?.

!2

A

No, Your Honor? it is not broken up on any

{
I

13

regional basis.

In this case, there is no similar situation

14

that existed in the Atlantic situation, on that break-up geo-

15

graphically.

I

16

Although counsel fails to state in so many words, it
i

17

is clear the basis of the Commission's order can only be that

18

there is a per se rule to strike down all TBA sales commission

IQ

arrangements between all oil companies and all tire companies.

20

On the record here, I submit, Your Honors, the Commission wants

21

to say that merely because you have a large oil company and a

22

I
large tire company, and that there has been quite a bit of money

23

paid, that that constitutes illegality.

24

25

I submit to Your Honors that record is 2,500 pages
long. We argued this case before the Court of Appeals, and the
54

1

Court of Appeals took a year, a full year, before the case was

2

decided by the Court of Appeals„

3

I submit, Your Honors, that that record was gone

5

ever thoroughly by the Court of Appeals when it decided this
■
case, the whole 2,500 pages of it* They searched to see whether

6

there was any evidence in that record to support the proposi­

7

tion that there had been a misuse of the power that Texaco

0

Company had in connection with these contracts.

find, it did not find, a misuse of that power.

It could not

This case has gone to the Court of Appeals on two

different occasions?
i

A

Yes, sir.

The same panel?

14

A

No.

12

15
16
17
18

In the second panel, Judge Bazelon, sitting

as the Chief Judge, was not in the first panel.

On the second

time, the decision was unanimous by the Court of Appeals.
Judge Bazelon and the other two judges held with us.
So there has been a total of six Court of Appeals

19

judges sit on this case, and the Court of Appeals has both

20

times — the first time by two to one, and the second time by

21

22
23
24
25

three to nothing — held there was no evidence of misuse of
economic power by Texaco.
Q

Who owns the Texaco Company stations?

A

I think most of them are

owned by people not

connected, by third parties, and by the owners themselves.

A

That is right, Your Honor,

That is what he has to get to make his living,

A

That is true, Your Honor,

10

Q

Then how do you discount the statement that was

read from by the Texaco agent of the big company, which has all

the power, how do you discount that where he says, "We prefer

Q

Let me ask you this s

Here is a company that

has the life or death of this Texaco dealer in its hand. A
f *
representative of the company comes to him and tells hira, "I
want you to buy and sell these things»58
What would you say about it as a person, with your

56

1

knowledge of what this amounts to in real life?

2

A

Your Honor, if it was proved that the Texaco

3

salesman went to the station and said, "I want you to handle

4

this," that would be a different case than we have here.
Q

Didn’t you hear that statement read by

in the record?

I submit to Your Honor —*

But, Your Honor, we have

to realise fchiss that there were 38,000 Texaco dealers.
Q

It is hard, of course, to get them to testify

against the dominant company.
A

I don't know that it is, because, as Mr. Handler

16

pointed out, there was a questionnaire that went out to these

17

dealers and the Commission got back that questionnaire and then

13

didn't call one of the dealers to the stand to testify after

19

they had seen the questionnaire, and they wouldn't show us the

20

questionnaire which they sent out when we applied for it.

That is the easiest way to get them to testify

against Ttxaco.

2

A

That is true, Your Honor.

But 1 submit, Your

3

Honor, in this case, where there has been a thorough review of

4

the record by the Court of Appeals twice, and they found that

S

there was no proof of the Commission's charge, that we have

disproved a negative.
I submit, Your Honors, it is difficult to disprove

a negative, but here if has been done.

It is difficult to answer that question.

A

The companies have responded when they were

attacked, Your Honor.
Q

They fought vigorously, as they should.

A

But when you say why has there been a delay,

I think I have to tell you truthfully it is because the

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

0

MR. FRSEDMANs

9

Mr. Chief Justice,, may it please the

Court s

10

To answer something Mr. Barton said, the basic ques­

n
12

tion here is whether there has been a misuse of economic power.

i3

No one is being punished here.

14

the prophylactic function of freeing our economy from improper

15

restraint.

The Commission is performing

The question is whether the use of this power is

16
17

enough to justify the Commission in concluding that it is an

18

unfair method of competition.
There has been a lot of talk about the'evidence in

19
20

this case.

I would like to go back to a couple of the items my

>1

opponents have referred to.

22

For example, this man, Mr. Tidwell, whom they say

23

felt perfectly free to carry these products nonetheless, at

>4

page 1211, after the passage previously referred to, was asked,

25

"Did you take on a cheaper line of tires?" and his answer was
59
i

1

"Not in stock;, but 1 did sell some

2

51

Then three or four lines thereafter, he was asked,

3

"Did you ever di.sp3.ay those fires in your station?”

4

"No, I never displayed any other products than Firestone.”

He said/

It seems to us it is very clear from this that what

5

6

he was saying was, because he wanted to remain in the good

1

graces of Texaco, he would not take these competing products

8

on as a display product that would be generally available for

9

the public to see.
Sure, ha would occasionally buy some of these

10
11

products.

12

wholesalers? that, y@s, they could sell an occasional item to

m

Texaco dealers, to many Texaco dealers.

14

things that people wanted- to stock up on, but basically there

15

was substantial testimony in this record that these people did

16

not have the same opportunity when they tried to penetrate the

i7

Texaco market as when they tried to penetrate some other mar­

18

ket.

IS

v •

That is fully consistent with the testimony of the

What do these dealers do?
Q

1 gather, then, Mr* Friedman, that you feel that’
jI
|

20

although the question may be whether the Commission could say

21

power plus promotion is enough, that nevertheless, really the

22

question is whether the Commission could rationally decide that:

23

promotion by one with power really . may have some substantial

24

consequences«

25

'

A

Yes.
60

\

1
2

3

Q

If that were wholly irrational, is that what this:

case is about?
A

We think so, Mr» Justice, consistent with the

4

long line of cases in this Court, which have reviewed Commis­

S

sion decisions under section 5, as to what the Commission“s

6

authority was»

1

Q

What if there was no evidence whatsoever in the

8

record as to what consequences promotion by Texaco had?

9

the Commission just rear back and say, "Look, in our own ex­

10

pertise, we know that when somebody with Texaco’s power says

11

this, it is going to have this kind of a consequence"?

12

13

A

I think they would have to have some basis for

their expertise»

If there has to be something there, I suppose

we have to look at the evidence on the other side, and then it

A

It is a factual matter only in the sense that
j

you have to see what the Commission had»

But it seems to me

that this is the area where the Commission has very great dis­
cretion as to evaluating the impact of these practices,
Q

You think they could just have said, "We don’t

need any evidence; we don't need any evidence at all; we just
know that when Texaco says something like what they have been

saying,, “Please buy this,8 it is going to be this consequence"?

There has to be some proof?

Q

10

1!

What if

The Court of Appeals says that the

They at least said there wasn't enough evidence

to even make it a rational choice.
A

12

No, Mr. Justice, we don’t think they said that,

j

13

What they said was, as they interpreted this Court’s Atlantic

14

decision, that Atlantic required the Commission to come up with

15

a, certain type of evidence, a certain quantum of evidence.

16

they said, "We don't, think that what the Commission, had before it

1?

in this case is enough."

Then

18

The Court, of Appeals did not attempt to say, "We

19

don't think there is any evidence here to show either that

20

Texaco in performing this contract was engaging in these pro­

2!

motional activities, or that there was not any competitive

22

effect."

23

They said, "Looking on what the Commission acted on,

24

looking at what the Commission found happened here, what Texaco

25

did, we don’t think this is enough as a matter of law, basically,

62

1

fco constitute an unfair method of competition."

2

Q

How does the Commission explain that only 30

3

percent

is it 30 percent of the dealers or was it 30 percent

4

of the total volume?
A

5

Let me explain it.

It was 30 percent of all the

6

dealers who were service station dealers.

7

explained that that figure was distoreted because a significant

3

number of those dealers were so-called "contract dealers" who

9

would not handle T3A.

For example, the grocery store that

10

had a couple of gasoline pumps.

11

the figure was higher than that.
Q

12

But the Commission

So the Commission indicated

How do they explain, though, that apparently an

13

awful lot of dealers who were promoted by Texaco exercised theix

14

choice to buy from someone else?

15

A

I think the type of plan —•

IS

Q

Did every dealer understand he had a free choicej

17

A

I think the difference may be, Mr. Justice, that

18

these plans are not always completely effective.

13

in Atlantic, too.
Q

20

This is true

Why wouldn't it be effective if they were the

21

dominant power and exercised the power?

22

effective?

Why wouldn't it be

23

A

I suppose to some extent it may depend on the —

24

Q

I suppose you have to say that it either wasn't

25

dominant or it wasn't exercised, one or the other.
63

1
£

3

A

I take it, again, it may depend on what the

reaction of the particular dealer is to the situation.
Q

May it not also depend on the reaction of the

4

customer coming in;, when he doesn't like a particular item,

5

and he asks him to get him a certain brand?

6

anything to do with it?

Would that have

■

7

A

I would have to say, Mr. Justice, in all candor,■

©

that the record does indicate that where a customer wanted a

9

particular, single tire, generally speaking most of the dealers;
I

10

would go out and buy the particular type of tire, even though

II

they didn't stock it.

12

G

j

That is what I meant.

Why wouldn't that show?
a

i:

13

That was why they were doing it, because the customer wanted

14

them to do it.

15

I have bought some tires myself.

16

A

The other thing, I suppose, Mr. Justice, is,of

17

course, Goodrich and Firestone are popular products.

18

the dealers may have been well satisfied to take the products.

19

Q

Some of

YGu don't thinkiit would have made any differ­

2,0

ence in this case .if Firestone or Texaco had given a good set

21

of warnings to everybody that said, "You have a free choice

22

and you are not bound to do anything. We are not coercing you.

23

We just think these are good." and 30 percent of the dealers

24

bought some of this and 70 percent didn't buy any.

25

think it would make any difference what the dealer felt?

\

You don't

A

No, I don't,

Mr. Justice, because it seems to

2

us that what we have here is (1) the relationship.

they did tell many dealers that they were free to buy what they

wanted, but apparently the record strongly indicates that de­

No, the record does not show that.

It seems to us that it would be appropriate for the

concluding that this particular practice had a sufficiently

1

Q

Suppose Texaco had had its own line of tires.

z

In your judgment# could the Commission find that it was an un­

3

fair method of competition for Texaco to make recommendations

4

to its service stations that they buy the Texaco tire?
A

5

I would think# Mr, Justice# the Commission could

6

so conclude.

7

has not passed upon that issue.
Q

8
9

I do want to make it very explicit the Commission

I know that.

But you think that Texaco# there­

fore# even without a tie-in sale# with the facts as they are

10

now# except that it is a Texaco product# do you think that

11

would still be an unfair method of competition?

12
13

A

I would thik the Commission could so conclude?

Q

Why can't it so conclude with respect to motor

yes.

oil?

16

it?

Texaco sells gasoline and motor oil# I suppose# doesn't

17

A

It doss.

18

Q

I suppose its dealers are at least encouraged to

19
20

buy and stock Texaco motor oil.
What you are saying# really# is that Texaco is in the

21

business of selling three major products and that something

22

drastic is warranted just because the third product is added to

23

the fundamental lines.

24

A

25

I don't know, Mr. Justice.

I think I said that

as you begin to acquire a greater and greater line# you begin
67

to get into problems»
Q

You sure get into problems.

I suppose the answer

is quite difficult.
A

Fortunately,, the Commission has not had to

face up to this problem.
(Whereupon, at 2s10 p.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled argument was concluded.)
