FURTHER ARGUMENT OF J. ROBERT SPARKS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SPARKS:

Mr. Chief Justices and honorable

.

Justices, at the recess yesterday afternoon I was just

•10

completing my response to questions by Justice Douglas -«»

ii

excuse me — not Douglas, Brennan —- as to the evidence of

12

scienter,

13

circumstances which we feel justified the jury to find that

14

this defendant knew all of the obscene nature of the matter.

15

I just want to elaborate in one respect.

16

Q

17
18

I had practically completed my summary of the

Do you mean obscene in regard to the contents

of the film?
A

That is right, the contents of the film.

19

of the obscene nature of the film.

20

Georgia statute reads, I believe.

21

22
23
24
25

He knew

That is the way the

I just want to point out two things in relation to
his statement, and then I will go on to something else.
In his unsworn statement he attempted to explain his
possession of the films in a manner consistent with lack of
knowledge of the contents.

I submit that it was unreasonable
29

1
i

'i

explanation,, somewhat unreasonable in two respects.

2

First, he said that a friend brought the films, left

3

them with him, saying he wanted the appellant to view the

4

films.

S

would have exchanged hands without some explanation on the part

6

of the unknown friend or some query on the part of the

7

appellant as to v/hat as to what kind of films are they,

8

particularly the small 8~mm. films in the can with the home­

9

made label,

I submit that it is a somewhat unreasonable that fliras

10

I feel quite sure that if anyone came to me and said

11

"I’ve got some films I want you to see," I would say "What are

12

they, films of your fishing trip or your family or—

13

Q

What kind of films are they?

14

A

They are films about girls.

15

Q

Would you have any real clue that they were

16

obscene films?

17

A

I think that would warrant further inquiry,

18

Q

That may be,- But what evidence is there that

19

there was ever any further inquiry or any further investigation

20

as to v/hat the films were about?

21

A

There is no evidence, because, of course, this

22

was an unsworn statement.

23

examine him or go into it without his consent unless he

24

voluntarily submitted himself to cross-examination,

25

Q

The State was not allowed to cross-

The State had the burden of proof, didn’t it?

30

1

A

Yes, the State had the burden of proof, your

2

Honor.

from my days as an Assistant U, S. Attorney.

goes ahead with an affirmative defense, then not the burden of

proof but the bixrden of making a reasonable explanation

shifts to the defendant»

X think this is both Federal and State law, as I recall

7

That leads me to my next point.

8

not identify his friend.

9

identify him by name.

10

Q

Where the defense

That is that he did

He neither produced him, nor did he

In that statement did he also say, C!I never saw

11

the films before today and never had shown them to anyone, so

12

help me”?
A

1.3

Yes, sir, that is true.

I want to point out in

14

that connection before I pass from this subject^ in the case of

15

Smith versus California, which this court decided, in which the

16

defendant was convicted for the offense of mere possession of

17

obscene matters under California ordinance, which had no

18

element of scienter, as interpreted by the California Supreme

19

Court.
The Court said, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennanj

20
21

‘ We might observe that it has been some time since the law

22

viewed itself as impotent to explore the actual state of a man's

23

mind.

24

”1 witnessed testimony of a bookseller’s perusal of

25

a book hardly be a necessary element in proving his awareness
31

1

of its contentso

2

that he was aware of what the book contained, despite his

3

denial.H

4

6

The circumstances may warrant the inference

I submit that those quoted words are pretty analogous
to the facts in this case.
We are relying on the circumstances.

We have no

7

direct evidence that he knew what the films were.

8

that till of the circumstances —* the impending party, the films

I don't know.

I think it suggests, your Honor, that we

normally associate sex with young people.

15

Q

I guess it is my age.

16

A

I want to pass on to another point.

17

I gathered yesterday from the questions asked my

!8

worthy adversairy, Mr. Asinof, that this court has not yet

19

viewed the contents of the films which were transmitted to this

20

court by the direction of the Georgia Supreme Court.

21

most respectfully and humbly urge this court to view the films

22

before ruling on the case.

23

Q

I wish to

Do you think we ought to view the films if there

24

are constitutional bases that don't relate to the subject

25

matter of the films for the disposing of this case, such as the
32

i

question of mere possession or the search-and-seizure question?

2

How do you want us to view the films?
A

reason why I feel that the films

should be viewed,

Even if we think that you candispose

of this

case on the possession ground of searclv-and-seizure, Fourth

7

Amendment ground?

8

A

Yes, I do, for this reason—”

9

Q

Tail me why,

10

A

This court, or the majority of this court, has

11

consistently held in obscenity cases from Roth on through

12

Jacobellis, Mishkin, Ginsberg — even Redrup, I believe — and

13

the last Ginsberg case in 1968 — that obscenity is not

14

protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution,

15

the Court views these films and finds that they are not only —

16

that they are not borderline obscenity, but hard-core

17

pornography—

No, sir, but I am not saying that.

seizure,

| 23
; 24

If this is obscene, then we should not breach the

Fourth-Amendment question?

20

22

And if

of fact,

As a matter

I am not absolutely certain, Mr, Justice, that the

search-and-seizure question is actually before this court.

33

Search and seizure is not an appealable question.
The Court noted probable jurisdiction without restricting the
question, the only appealable question, which is the
constitutionality of the Georgia Obscenity Act.
The same thing happened in the Mishkin case, and the
Court dismissed — they said that the search-and-seizure
question was properly briefed by both parties, but then
declined to pass on it and said that probable jurisdiction
had been erroneously noted as far as they were concerned.
However, I do feel that the Court would have to pass
on the search-and-seizure question, but right now I am
addressing myself—
Q

I want to be clear on one matter with respect

to your position.
A

Yes.

Q

Here is some allegedly obscene films.

I haven't

seen them, but if I should decide that this case must be
reversed on the possession point or on the search-and-seizure
point, Fourth Amendment points, I would not consider it — as
personally advised I would not consider it necessary to endure
a sight of motion-picture films, whatever their content may be.
Do you consider that you disagree with that present
thought of

Blind?

A

I disagree with it, your Honor, so far as the

First Amendment is concerned.
34

1

Q

1 am not talking about the First Amendment„

I

a

am talking about the two points that I am talking about, namely,

3

the possession and the matter of seizure, which are Fourth*»

4

Amendment points.

S

A

Your Honor, 1 feel that the—

6

Q

Maybe possession is a. First-Amendment point, but

7

not in the sense that you are talking about it,

3
9
10

A

But the Appellant is asking this court to

declare a mere-possession count — I say mere possession with
scienter *— unconstitutional,
Q

n

But if we should conclude that a statute making

12

mare possession a criminal offense is unconstitutional under

13

the First Amendment, regardless of the nature of the films,

14

then it obviously wouldn’t be necessary for us to see the

15

films, would it?
A

16

Your Honor, 1 take the reverse position.

I

17

say that you should see the films, and if they are hard-core

18

pornography and outside the protection of the First Amendment,

19

as this court has held in Roth and a whole series of cases,

20

then it would not be necessary—
Q

21

But assuming that I should conclude that so far

22

as I am concerned mere possession cannot be punished as a

23

crime, regardless of how obscene the film might be, then it

24

would follow that there would be no point in my seeing the

25

film.

Isn’t that right?

I mean that seems to me to follow
35

1

as a matter of course ,

2

Now, 1 know your position is that if the film is

3

obscene, mere possession can be punished.

4

1 disagreed with that, then obviously it ti/ould not be necessary

5

for me to endure a showing of this film,

6

ing it as obscene,

7

it probably is not one of the greatest works of art that has

8

ever been struck by the hand of man,

But I say that if

I am not characteriz­

1 don't know whether it is or not.

9

A

That is an understatement, your Honor,

10

Q

1 want to raise this point,

But

I hope you are going to address yourself to

11
12

the constitutionality of this statute, mere possession without

13

any purpose to exhibit, sell or display,

To the best of my knowledge and research, and X

16
17

Yes, sir, that was going to be my next point.

believe—
Q

As I read the record, it seems to me that the

18

only thing established by evidence is that the picture has

19

been displayed in Atlanta, because when it was displayed at

20

the prosecuting attorneyTs office to a group of people —

21

is that right?

22

A

That is the only evidence that it has been

23

displayed in Atlanta,

24

They looked at it in the Appellant's home.

25

Yesterday, Mr, Justice, you asked me about what the

expert photographer said.

He said that the fliras are badly

That is true, sir.

We didn’t have any eye»

Wasn’t the evidence that the Appellant had

It can either disregard it-

I am not saying that the Court should believe

done was at least to have named him* so that the prosecution

ARGUMENT OF WESLEY R. ASINOF, ESQ.

S

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
■

MR. ASINOFs

7

May it please the Court, with respect

3

to Smith versus California, that prosecution involved a

9

bookseller under an ordinance referring to bookselling.

10

Consequently, the. sale would deal with who was in the business

11

of selling books.

;

Q

12

But the Court has said that obscenity is not

14

protected by the First Amendment.
■
A
In the North North case, where that precedent

15

was established, we find that the North case was a question of

16

distribution.

17

something that we admittedly v/ill say is pornographic, the

18

Constitution does not protect him from the distribution.

19

this is followed in the Redrup case.

In the distribution you are dealing with the

question of furnishing it to others®

11

privacy of your own home, where no one else has seen it, where

12

there is no evidence that anyone else is intended to come into

13

contact with it — I say that no case holds that it is not

14

protected, that an individual cannot take a picture of his

15

own obscenity and posterity for himself, if he so chooses,

16

because to prohibit a person from possessing it would violate

17

the First Amendment rights.
Q

18

What do you say about

That in itself would be a violation of the

22

First Amendment, to say that a person could not write what he

23

wants in his own diary, for his own personal future use and not

24

to be shown to any other person.

25

We say that the First Amendment is an absolute
42

1

amendment that gives a man the freedom of the press, and the

2

freedom of the press carries with it the freedom of motion-

3

picture films.

Q

But the Court has decided — at least the

majority has decided •••» that it is not an absolute right.

6

A

1

Roth case involved—

8

Q

But you can nip it in the bud.

9

A

Then we come to the Redrup case.

But that was held in the Roth case.

And the

This court

10

.last year in Redrup and tha other cases that went with it

11

reversed, on the Fifth and on the First Amendment, that this

12

was not a case involving one of the three elements of

13

distribution to minors, distribution to persons who are willing

14

to see it, or pandering, which was held in Ginzburg.
Now, if we accept Redrup as being the law, then, of

15
16

course, we. must take Redrup and Roth together as they both

17

hold and say that obscenity insofar as its mere possession

18

and bare possession — and I use that expression — that bare

19

possession would be protected by the First Amendment, because

20

there you are not intruding upon the privacy or the rights of

21

others to be free on this.
1 would like to answer my opponent with respect to

22
23

this.

He says that the State Court found that the State

24

statute did not remove the element of scienter.

25

as I understand it, is that this court will accept an

43

Nov;, the rule,

1

interpretation placed upon a state court as to a non-Pederal

2

ground, but as to a Federal constitutional ground this court

3

is not precluded by virtue of a holding of a state court on

4

the constitutional issue from reversing that state court,

S

because this court is the one that must decide the Federal

6

ground»

7

Now, secondly, in the brief of the Appellee, on

8

page 45, he cites the case of Rainwater versus Florida, which

8

was decided by this court during the last term.

The Rainwater

10

versus Florida case x^as one that originated in the State Court,

11

There was a Federal search warrant issued under the Wage and

12

Tax Act and seized certain items from the defendant's

13

possession.

14

And they prosecuted him in the State Court,

This court remanded under the theory of Grosso and

15

Marchetti and remanded it back to the State Court for further

16

proceedings, not inconsistent with Grosso and Marchetti,

17

This is identical to the case we have here.

18

The State says in its brief that there the prosecuticr

19

in the State Court was the end result of the issuance of the

20

Federal search warrant.

21

This prosecution for obscenity was the end result of the

22

issuance of the Federal search warrant, which actually under th«.

23
24
25

That is what we have in this case.

Rainwater versus Florida doctrine 'was inadmissible as having
been unconstitutionally obtained,
Q

To get back to this possession point, under the

State law, assuming that possession were a crime —» mare

2

possession was a crime and not protected by the First

Amendment ~ could the State get out a search warrant to

search your own library on the basis of an affidavit that would

15

say that you have in that library a copy of James Joyce's

ULYSSES, a copy of this book and that book?

out a search warrant to examine your entire library?

I think that the

Constitution in the Fourth Amendment says that the warrant shall

In other words, they would have to name the

That, is my view of that, amendment.

How, one point that was raised by my adversary.

He

15

said that the evidence in the case indicated that one reel of

16

film had been wound backward or was scratched and that that

n

would indicate that someone had previously viewed that film.

18

But it would not show, and we submit to this court, that that

19

fact alone would not show that this defendant or this appellant

20

had ever viewed it-,
i

21

Now, in conclusion I would like to state that since

22

my opponent has —- or my adversary

has suggested to this

23

court that this court view the film, he has in effect stated

24

now that how does this court know obscene it is without

25

viewing it.

That is our very position in this case.

We say
'

I

1

that with respect to the Appellant the same position holds

2

true,

3

know that they are obscene, because without viewing them you

4

cannot learn of its obscenity»

5

If he has never viewed the films, he obviously would not

That is the point that we have in this case.

We say

6

that since the evidence doesn't show he ever viewed the films,

7

therefore there is no evidence that he knew or could have

S

known that they were obscene.

Thank you.
