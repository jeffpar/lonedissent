ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. MacLAURY, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR, MacLAURY:

a

10

Counsel are present,

Mr.Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
I would like to return for a moment to the question of

1!

Justice Douglas had yesterday and the suggestion that there

12

must have been control by Western over Regal because of

13
14

is
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Western's 55 percent stock interest in Regal,
My response to Mr. Justice Douglas’ question was that
although Western was in a position to control Regal, there was
no evidence that there was in fact control.
I might add to that answer this morning, and say that
I think it will be recognised that Western as the: majority
stockholder in Regal, had an obligation to the minority stock­
holders in Regal and it was Western’s obligation as a majority
stockholder to honor its obligations to the minority and tc
see that Regal could resell its gasoline at a price that would
return to Regal a normal profit.
In other words, that the majority in Western had
an obligation to frain from dealing with Regal and controlling
•58

1
a

Regal to the point that Regal would operate at a loss*
Mow the fact is that Western paid Signal slightly

3

higher or approximately the same prices for its gasoline that

4

Perkins paid Standard.

5

Now Signal owned the majority interest in Western

6

and was obligated to treat the minority interests in Western

7

fairly and to refrain from compelling Western to operate at a

8

loss or to sell at a loss to Regal.

9

Beyond this , the fact of the matter was that the

to

minority stockholders in VJestern were actually the controlling

n

officers and controlled the operations of Western and they were

12

in a very good position to see that their own interests were

13

properly taken care of.

14

Q

Whether there was control or not, I suppose

15

Signal's lower price was either passed on or it wasn’t.

16

wasn't passed on, I suppose the Perkins case gets much tougher,

17

doesn't it?

18

A

It certainly does, yes.

19

Q

Was that issue put to the jury?

20

If it

I suppose on

one theory of the case the jury would have had to have found

21

that it was passed on?

22

A

No, I do not believe so.

23

Q

Well, they came out with a verdict for Perkins?

24

A

Yes, they did.

25

I would like to step back a moment and say this:
59

'

i

That the Respondents asked that this question of passing on

2

be put to the jury»

3

say that on page 5 of our brief

The court refused to do that and I might

4

Q

S

If it was passed on on a regular basis, it doesn't

6

Well, let me just ask something else»

really make much difference about control does it?

7

A

No,

8

Q

And if it wasn’t passed on, it doesn't make

9

any difference about control either?
A

10

The fact of the matter is that there is no dispute

11
12

13
14

between Petitioners and Respondents as to the price that
Western paid for its gasoline.

17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24

That evidence was put in on

the basis of invoices.
The invoices of Signal Oil and'Gas to Western and

15
1S

I think that is correct.

there was no conflict in it and that invoice evidence is
summarized in the footnote at page 22 of our brief and it shows
that

for* virtually all of the time Western paid a higher price

for gasoline than Perkins.
Q

How does Regal get off

with selling at such a

low price unless it buys its gas at a low price.

Now just how

does that operate like that?
A

Well, that, I think, goes to the very question,

and the policy question as to why Congress cut this viability
off at the third level.

25
60

S

1

Regal,, it was established in the evidence had a very

2

large, well-situated stations.

3

of gasoline? they concentrated on large volume stations; they

4

opened with a well-advertised campaign and it was Perkins' own

5

marketing experts.

6

had actually worked for years in that Portland market and he

7

was an independent at this time and he testified that he

8

was in Portland then and he said it wasn't the prices of Regal

0

that had the impact.
~

They concentrated on the sale

It wasn't a professor or somebody.

He

i

The real impact of Regal was on its tremendous

10

11

advertising campaign, its promotional campaign and its method

12

of selling gasoline.
Q

13
14

A

Q
A

13

20

23
24
25

That they did.
-— that there was a reduction in the price in

Portland of some 4 cents immediately after Regal came on the
market.
But, Mr. Justice, we sould not attribute that 4 cents

21

22

Well, I think we would have to accept for the

purpose of this record here —

IT

19

Selling

prices for gas?

15

16

You mean they didn't have lower prices?

reduction in the Portland market to the less than half cent
advantage that Signal had over Perkins.

And at the very time

that Rsgal opened, Signal was paying a higher price than
Perkins.

SI

Q

Doesn't the record show what Regal was paying .

A

There is no direct evidence in this record as

for ghs?

to what Regal was paying, except the ordinary inference that
I think should be drawn, that Western paid a higher price
than Perkins and we can't assume that Western is going to sell
to Regal at a loss.
Q

Well, you are suggesting though that it is quite

rational to, a rational inference, that Regal although selling
at 4 cents below what the price was, nevertheless was paying
the same price for gas that other people were?
A

Yes, that is what I am suggesting, and I am

suggesting also that because of Regal's more efficient
operation, Regal was probably taking a lower profit than these
other markets.

They were probably operating on a large

volume and low unit cost and also, Regal could not perform
the ordinary regular services that you connect with a service
station, such as the lubrication and repairs and that sort of
thing.

They very efficiently concentrated on the sale of

gasoline,,
‘

That was the testimony of the Petitioner’s own
witnesses.

And I think a lot of it could be attributed to thatj
Q

But if you sell gasoline below the cost per

gallon, the more gasoline you — and that is all you sell, the
more gasoline you sell the more money you lose.
62

Is that right?

1

A

You are absolutely correct.

2

Q

It is just like ribbons.

3

At less than they cost

you, the more ribbons you sell the more money you lose.

4

A

You are absolutely correct, of course.

5

Q

I want to repeat to you the question that I

S

asked you yesterday»-, but I didn't ask it well.

7

again today.

I will try it

8

Let us suppose that Signal owned 100 percent of

a

Western and Western owned 100 percent of Regal and let us

10
it

suppose that Standard sold to Signal at the lower price them it
sold the same product to Perkins.
And let us assume that all the other statutory re­

12

13

quirements were met, without competition
Would that be a violation of 2(a)?

14

A

I would have to answer that, Mr. justice, in

15
16

this way.
Without more, the answer would, be no.

I still think

17
13

I it would take a factual inquiry to determine whether or not
there was actual direction by Signal of the decisions of

19
20

Western and by Western of the decisions of Regal.
I dons t think the inquiry of the burden would be

21

22

nearly as strong or as heavy as it is in this situation, but
of course that is not the situation.

23
Q

I understand that.

I respect the logic of your

24
answer.

I expect you probably have to answer it that way

25
S3

1

consistently with your position.

2

A

«

I would like to go one step further than that.

3

X believe it is the presumption in virtually every field of

4

law that where there are separate entities,, these separate

5

entities make their own decisions, and I recognize that where

6

there is 100 percent control the burden of showing to the

7

contrary is not nearly the burden that Petitioner would have

8

here.

9

We also have this further problem which X was going

10

to mention, Mr. Justice, that where Signal is holding itself

1?

out as an independent corporation, where Western is holding

\2

itself out as an independent corporation and where Regal is

13

holding itself out as an independent corporation, if there was

14

actual price control down the line it would be a serious

15

danger of the violation of the Sherman Act, and I don't think

16

such a serious violation of the law can be lightly inferred

17

just from the matter of this control, of stock control.
1

18

Q

I just still wonder if control is very relevant.

19

A

Well, that brings me to I think it is relevant

20
21

22
23
24
25

and it brings me to -—
Q

But if Standard's price cut was passed on, right

on through at all levels, I wouldn't think the lack of control
would necessarily ruin Perkins' case.
A

Well, it would here

put it this way.

The

ultimate seller. Western Hyway on the third level, then control
64

1

makes no difference., but even if this price differential had

z

been passed on all the way down to Regal at the fourth level

3

then I would say that that is beyond the purview of Robinson-

4

Patman.

5

Mr. Justice, that brings me to the —--

6

Q

Unless you view it as a line of commerce case.

*»4«

A

Unless you view it as a line of commerce case

8

which we acknowledged yesterday.
And that brings me to a further answer perhaps to the

9
10
11
12

13
14

question that you asked yesterday and that was this question:
That the original language of the Clayton Act aside, were not
Signal and Perkins competitors on the secondary level?

the answer to that is that within the meaning of the language
of the Robinson-Patman Act the answer must be no.
The first answer is that Robinson-Patman uses the

15
16
17
18

word "competition'1’ in its practical sense.

21

That means as an

endeavor of two or more persons to get the same trade from the
same people at the same place at the same time.

19
20

I think

Q

Well, now Perkins was competing with somebody

A

Well, I am certain that Perkins was competing

wasn't he?

with somebody, yes.
22
Q

Well, if Standard's lower price to Signal had

23

the effect of lowering or lessening competition in whatever
24

market Perkins was competing in, it wouldn't make any
25

65

1

2

difference whether Perkins and Signal were competing or not.?
A

Well? let me respond to that this way:

Just

3

because somewhere down the line a purchaser of Signal Gasoline,

4

third, fourth, fifth level down below, a purchaser of Signal

5

Gasoline somewhere confronted and competed with a purchaser

Q

of Perkins Gasoline, that wouldn't make Perkins and Signal

7

a compatitor or competitors for the purpose of this act.

a

11
12

13
14
15
16

17
10

19
20

21

22
23

That wouldn't mean that Perkins and Signal competed
on the secondary level, because if this were so, then every
non-primary line case would have to be a secondary line case
and clearly this is not what Congress meant.
Congress recognised the realities of the market,
it recognised the different levels, and Congress talked about
competition with the grantor, competition with the favorite
purchaser, competition with the customer of the favorite
purchaser and if the argument is accepted just because some­
where way down the line there are people competing with
gasoline derived from these two sources, Signal and Perkins,
j that that means that Perkins and Signal were competing at the
secondary line, then this elaborate definition of language used
by Congress would be entirely superfluous.
Congress could simply have forbidden price dicerimination, whose effect may be "injure, destroy or prevent
competition with any person" but Congress I think wisely so

24
refrained from going that far,
25

j,
t

66
I

Q

1

Why did Congress cut off the line of responsi­

2

bility in that way?

On the grounds that it would not be fair

3

to attribute responsibility to the original supplier, here

4

Standard?

5

A

I think that is correct»

6

Q

Is there any other reason, I can't think of

A

Well, I think that there could be so many

7
8
9
10

any.

intervening factors, by the time you get to the third level»
Q

One of the questions you have here is whether

11

that reasoning of the Congress applies to a case where there is

12

majority stock ox^nership down the line? that is to say, whether

13

in that kind of a case where you have a line of a majority

14

stockholders involved all the way through such as you have here,

15

the reasoning of Congress applies that is to say that it would

16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
£5

not be fair or appropriate to pin responsibility upon the
original seller, here Standard?
A

There are just one oi* two other points I would

like to cover before my time is up.

I have only a few moments

left and that, is this:
Petitioner asked that the verdict be reinstated.
suggest that that should not be done.

We

There were many material

errors in the trial court which were presented to the Court
of Appeals, which the Court of Appeals did not move upon.
One of them was this question of causality, and that
67

1

question of causality cuts across the Robinson-Patman Act

2

standards as well as the original Clayton Act standard.

3

S

S
10

it
12

13
14
15

Mow, in addition, there were serious and important
questions concerning liability, there were questions concerning
the fact of injury, there were also questions concerning the
good faith meeting of competition defense»
Some of these questions the Court of Appeals ruled
on against Perkins, others it reserved ruling but admonished
that its failure to rule was not to be taken by the trial court
as appellate approval»
Nottf to resolve these questions would require the
review of this vast record, some 6,000 pages of transcript
and some 15,000 or more pages of exhibits w'hich we suggest
would more appropriately be left in the first instance to
the Court of Appeals.
One more point, there has been some talk about Regal

16
selling at a loss, Mr. Justice.

Regal must not have sold at a

17

loss because there was a difference between 5 and 6 cents,
18

according to Perkins testimony, between the price that Regal
19

sold and the price that Perkins8 single, retail station in
20

Vancouver sold.
21

How this difference certainly couldn’t have been
22

attributed to the less than one-half cent price differential
20
that was granted to Signal after January.
24
Again, I don't think we can assume that Regal would
2S
68

sell at a loss because X don31 think that there — X think

2

the majority stockholders there in Western would have been

violating their obligations to the minority to have compelled

Regal to sell*

Q

Doesn't the record show the price that Regal

A

Mo, your Honor, there was no evidence in the

record of the price that Regal paid,

Why is that?

A

I do not know X'fhy.

The auditor for Regal was

on the: stand»

12

fied as to what Western's prices were, put the invoices in,

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr„ Kintner»

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP EARL W. KINTNER, ESQ»
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR» KINTNER:

It was the auditor, Mr, Chief Justice,

and. may it please the Court, it was the auditor who was put on
69

1

the stand by Standard and Mr. MacLaury examined him and did

2

not ask any questions with respect to the price.

3

of fact, Mr. MacLaury said yesterday in his argument that the

4

minority ownership of Western Hyway lay with the officers of

5

Western Hyway.
1 quote you from the printed record a question to

6
7

this same auditor by Mr. MacLaury.
"With respect to the years 1955,

8
9
10

As a matter

’56 and '57, what

entities or what persons owned the stock, the capital stock
of Western Hyway Oil Company?
"Answer.

11

In Western Hyway Oil Company, 60 percent

12

of the shares were owned by Signal Oil and Gas Company and 40

13

percent was owned by three individuals who were corporate

14

officers.”

15

16
17

But he didn't ask corporate officers of Signal or
corporate officers of Western Hyway.
Q

Could you just briefly tell me what your

18

ultimate theory is here under the Robinson-Patman Act, is it

19

the line of commerce theory or is it the injury or preventing

20

competition with Regal?

21

22
23
24
25

A

I think, sir, that there are at least two

possible alternatives here for this court.
I believe beyond question that the Ninth Circuit
was wrong with respect to the old Clayton Act *—Q

Yes, but what is your theory?
70

What is your

1

theory about how would you prove a case under the Robinson-

z

Patman Act in this?
A

3

1 think that the case can be proved under the

4

old Clayton Act by showing a discrimination,,

3

has indicated that the jury —

Mr. MacLaury

6

Q

A discrimination between Perkins and Signal?

7

A

Perkins and Signal.

8

Q

And then what is the line of commerce that is

A

The line of commerce is the whole Northwest

9

injured?

10

11

petroleum marketing as our expert witness indicated.
Q

12

A

13

Q

14

A

15
16

17

Bothwholesale —
The competition is down at the retail level.
This is where the price is

felt.
Q

You mean the line of commerce is the retail sale

of gasoline?
A

20
21

Yes, sir.

That is where the injury is felt.

18
19

You mean on all levels?

Yes, your Honor, and in this instance the

retail and wholesale because Perkins had an average profit of
1.54 percent and Standard itself indicated that it took 2 cents

22
to live.
23

Q

Well, was there any indication in the record

24

about the characteristics of this market, the geographica].
25

71

1

market and the product market and what percentage Perkins has

2

in it or not?

3

A

Perkins had 2» 4 percent of the overall market»

4

Q

But that is in the record?

5

A

That is in the record»

That is the equivalent

6

of what Sun Oil has antionaXXy»

7

Standard’s gallonage in that market»

8

of that market»

9

gasoline, 50 percent of his gallonage of fuel oil during the

20
21

22
23
2.4

Standard had 30 percent

Perkins lost 13 percent of his gallonage of

claim period and Signal gained 50 percent during the claim
period,,
Perkins was making an average of 1»54 cents a gallon»

12

13

Perkins sold 8 percent of

Standard’s own witnesses stated that it took 2 cents a gallon
to live and if you added the discrimination which Standard
gave to

Signal to Perkins’ price, Perkins would have had 2»2

cents per gallon which would have given him a fighting chance
of living in that market»
Now there is no evidence as to the price that Regal
sold in that market»
Standard’s own executives acknowledged that Regal
had a better price than Perkins and that Regal would wreck that
market unless something was done to control them»
Thera is no evidence of Western’s price to Regal»
Standard was in a position to supply this but didn’t do it,
and in that connection this court has held with respect to the

2.5

7Jt

1

matter of ---

2

Q

3

didn!t you?

4

A

But you have the burden of proof in this case,

Yes, your Honor, and if I might return to this

3

question of control, I think that we adduced sufficient evidence

6

from which the jury could have inferred that there was control

7

with respect to Regal and Western by Signal.

8

Q

What was that evidence?

9

A

10

Q

What was that evidence?

11

A

The amount of ownership and —--

12

Q

13

A

I beg your pardon.

Besides the ownership.
and there is other evidence that Standard

14

treated an offer made to Western Hyway for the purchase of

15

gasoline as an offer made to Signal, its customer.

16

That is

in the record.

; i7

We think in looking at the whole evidence, the whole

io

record, the jury could reasonably have inferred that there was

19
20

21

22
i 23
! 24
25

control.
Q

You would agree, wouldn't you, that the fact

that Regal sold at a lower price than Perkins, it was not
established a violation of law standing alone?
A

Not standing alone, sir.

Q

Now, as I understand Mr. Justice White's question,

which is the same question which I have in my mind, could you

73

1

state succinctly as to what the theory was on which you tried

2

this case?

3

than Perkins.

4

It wasn't just that Regal sold for a lower price

What is the theory on which this case was tried?

5

I was a little startled to learn that the invoices showing the

S

prices paid by Regal are not in this record, but apart from

7

that parenthetical remark, would you tell us just what your

8

theory was and is on this case?

9

A

The theory was that Standard gave a better

10

price to Signal which resulted as it was passed down the line

11

in a price war which spread from Portland as one x*/ould drop

12

a pebble in a pool of water, throughout the Northwest Territory,

13

Northwest market.

14

Also, there is considerable proof that Standard,

15

because of this price war, gave special assistance to its

IS

retail stations which were branded stations, which were com­

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

peting with the Perkins stations just as Perkins stations
were competing with the Regal stations, so that what you hai7e
here, as Dr. Munn pointed out in his testimony is an
examination of the whole petroleum marketing situation in the
Northwest and based upon his hypotheticals, he found that
there was a lessening of competition, a tendency toward monopoly
and. a probability of higher prices.
Q

So you. suggest it makes no difference whether

Signal, Western and Regal were or were not connected by

stockholders?

It makes no difference at what level the Signal

stations were in terms of their remoteness from Standard?
A

I think, sir, that that under the old Clayton

Act it makes no difference with respect to the showing of
injury not based on functions, but alternatively —Q

When you say the old Clayton Act, what are you

talking about?
A

This is the first alternative spelled out in

the amended Clayton Act which is a carryover of the language.,
the same language, used in Sections 3 and 7 which this court
has interpreted many times.
Q

What part of the law are you talking about?

A

I am talking about the amended, the Robinson-

Patman Act -Q

Section 2(a)?

A

-- Section 2(a) , amendments to the Clayton Act

which carried over in the amendments the first alternative,
injury to competition and tendency toward monopoly and added
the functional amendment to the Clayton Act under which I also
think we have adequate evidence here in this record from which
the jury could have found that is the requisite injury»
Q

Your theory cuts back far underneath years and

years of gloss on Section 2(a), doesn3t it?
A

Section 2(a) has been glossed at the functional

level many times.

I think it is time this court ruled oh the

7'5

1

first alternative and made that first alternative applicable

2

as it has made the similar language applicable under Sections

3

3 and 7.
