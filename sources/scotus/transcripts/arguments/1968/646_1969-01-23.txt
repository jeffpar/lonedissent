PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE;

No. 646, Jamas F. O'Callahan

Petitioner versus J.J. Parker, Warden.
Mr. Rabinowitz?
ARGUMENT OF VICTOR RABINOWITZ, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. RABINOWITZ;

May it please the court, this case

8

is before the court on a writ of certiorari to the Court

9

of Appeals from the Third Circuit.

It is limited to a single

10

legal issue which we think is of profound importance to

11

several million young Americans now in the armed forces of the

12

United States, relating to the balance between civil and

13

military jurisdiction over them.

14

The question is a simple one.

Does a court martial

15

have jurisdiction in peace time to try a member of the armed

16

forces charged with a civilian crime, and by that I mean a

17

crime which is normally cognizable in the civil courts,

18

alleged to have been committed by him off post and off duty.

19

In this case the crime is attempted rape.

20

the government is right, it could try a member of the armed

21

forces for any crime at all, including security violations,

22
23
24
25

But if

violation of the anti-trust laws or anything else.
Unless the court thinks this is a far fetched
example, I learned this morning that a Technical Sargeant
at Myrtle Air Base in South Carolina was convicted just a

2

t

few days ago of the crime of income tax evasion by a court

2

martial.

3

The relative role of the military in civilian

4

governments has been of considerable concern throughout our

5

history and for that matter, throughout the history of England.

6

On the one hand, the Constitution provides that Congress may

7

make rules for the government in regulation of the land and

8

naval forces.

9

in an Article 3 court, for grand jury indictment.

On the other hand, it provides for jury trial,
In federal

10

cases, and most states, have similar provisions, with some

11

variation on the grand jury, but all of them provide for

12

a trial before a civilian court and a jury trial.

13

In this kind of situation this court has always

14

taken the position that in order to determine the relationship

15

of these two apparently conflicting decisions or provisions

16

that may conflict in our Constitution, that it is appropriate

17

IS
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

to look into the historical factor, to look at the probable
intent of the framers of the Constitution and to determine on
the basis of that what rule shall apply.
Now, we differ somewhat with the government on our
views of history, which is not particularly surprising.

But

as we see the history, for over 100 years, both before and
after the adoption of the Constitution, court martial juris­
diction was limited both in this country and in England, to
offenses such as desertion, mutiny, striking or scorning a

3

1

superior officer, tardiness for parade, failure to salute,

2

theft from military stores, and a host of other offenses,

3

bearing an obvious and immediate relationship to the army,

4

many of which are not punishable in the civilian court at all.

5

These are the kind of offenses, and the only kind of

6

offenses, listed in the Articles of War adopted by the

7

Continental Congress in 1775, renewed in 1776, and in essence,

8

they are the offenses to which court martial jurisdiction was

9

provided in the United States in peacetime up until 1916.

10

It was in the Articles of 1916, perhaps anticipation

tl

of another war, but in any event, in 1916 for the first time,

12

Congress provided court martial jurisdiction.

13

of War for the first time defined crimes other than military

14

crimes, going to offenses such as rape, murder, assault and

15

similar ordinary conventional civilian offenses.

16

And the Articles

Now, the framers of the Constitution obviously did

17
•

not act in a vacuum.

18

numerous occasions, both in handling jury cases, such as patent

19

particularly in handling military law cases, such as

20

Covert against Reed, and many cases that follow that, the

21

people who framed the Constitution were quite aware of the

22

English Revolution, they were aware of the abuses they

23

themselves suffered in this very field and it may reasonably

24

be assumed that they wrote the Constitution with this in mind*

25

As this court has pointed out on

English history is I think fairly clear.
4

In 1627,

the Petition of Right addressed to Charles I, complained
of the institution of court martial for any offense, even
an offense trying a soldier, if that happened in the courts
of England where the civil courts were open»

And the Petition

was addressed to the King, because the King had directed
commissions to go forth and to try members of the armed
forces, although the civilian courts, according to the
Petition, were perfectly capable of trying these offenses»
As a result of the Petition of Right, King Charles
withdrew his military commissions, but the subject was a
matter of considerable conflict between Parliament and the
Stuarts for a good while after.
In 1689, after the Revolution of 1688, Parliament
passed the Mutiny Act, which for the. first time, provided
by Act of Pailiament at least, trial by court martial of
people in the armed forces and the only three offenses that
were listed in the Mutiny Act were desertion, sedetion and
mutiny.
Now the Act was of very limited duration.
Act was passed for a period of one single year.

The first

And Parliament

did, over the next century, renew the statute annually.

Each

time confining court martial jurisdiction for crimes committed
within England to crimes that were clearly military in nature
of the type mentioned in the Mutiny Act of 1689, desertion,
sedition, disrespect to a superior officer, that sort of thing.
5

1

Now it is true that as the English Empire expanded

2

and England took up commitments in foreign countries that

3

court martial jurisdiction was exercised over crimes committed

4

by members of the armed forces on civilians in foreign

5

countries, but only in foreign countries, never in England.

6

There is some discussion among the authorities

7

indicating — and there is a case of England in the middle

8

of the 18th century — holding that whereas court martial

9

jurisdiction within England came under the Mutiny Act and

10

therefore within the area of Parliament’s jurisdiction

11

court martial jurisdiction overseas was within the King’s

12

prerogative.

13

And I think by analogy we might very well say that

14

whereas court martial jurisdiction in the United States in

15

time of peace is quite a different thing from court martial

16

jurisdiction in times of war.

17

court martial jurisdiction may perhaps be argued for as coming

18

within the war power of Congress, this particular offense

19

in the issue presented before us was committed in time of

20

peace.

21

Civil courts were open.

22

those periods in history in which there didn’t have to be

23

a war.

24
25

It was in 1956.

And in time of war an extended

It was in the Territory of Hawaii.
There was no war.

It was one of

The issue is not an issue of the war power of
Congress, but rather an issue of Congress' power to take
6

away from persons in the armed forces the right of trial by
jury and the other protections of the Constitution.
Q

You see no escape from the constitutional

A

I really see no escape.

question?

statute is clear.

I think that the

The statute asserts jurisdiction over

everybody in the armed forces and I really have difficulty
in avoiding the constitutional issue.
I think, and I will come to that in a moment, your
Honor, there may be several different views of the
constitutional issue as your Honor suggested in the
concurring opinion in. Covert.

But that there is a

constitutional issue here, it seems to me, is unavoidable.
Now, when the Colonists drew the Constitution it is
perfectly obvious that this was a matter of considerable
importance.

And as a matter of fact, the Declaration of

Independence contains a reference to the fact that one of
the complaints listed against the King was that he had
asserted military jurisdiction over crimes committed by the
armed forces, by the English soldiers on civilians in the
United States, or what was then the Colonies. And this was
protested against.
And I might say that throughout history there have
been two parallel lines here.

On the one hand there has

been the complaint of the civilian that the Army will take
7

jurisdiction and provide what the Declaration of Independence
calls a mock trial, thus permitting the military to abuse
the civilian by trying them in according with presumably
more lenient rules.

On the other hand, there has been a simila

complaint, or I should say the opposite complaint, arising
out of the same context, that the Army will provide for the
soldier a more strict and a more difficult form of punishment
than he would get in the civilian courts because he does not
have in the Army the right of trial by jury, right to a civilia;
court and the right to a grand jury indietment.
And I think the fact is that both of these things may
happen and it is to avoid both of these -things that we think
civilian jurisdiction ought to be given.
Dow the Articles of War adopted in 1776 remain
unchanged so far as this particular subject is concerned. Until
the Enrollment Act of 1863 in the midst of the Civil War,
when for the first time, Congress passed the statute giving
some degree of military jurisdiction over civilian crimes.
That was specifically confined to time of war and this court
held in the Coleman case and the series of cases that
followed, that Congress intended by that statute to give
jurisdiction of the military only in cases where the civilian
courts were not operating.

The leading case of course is

Coleman against Tennessee, where the issue arose as to who
had jurisdiction over a crime committed by a member of the

8

Union forces in the then occupied territory of Tennessee. There
were then no civilian courts operating, certainly no civilian
courts of the United States.

There may have been civilian

courts of the Confederacy operating.

The court said it would

be absurd to say that a soldier in the Union Army could be
tried by a civilian federal court by a Conferedate civilian
court and held that the Army had military jurisdiction over
that crime.
But this court has repeatedly since that time
interpreted the 1863 Act as applying only where Armies were
actually in the field and where civilian courts were not open.
As I say it was not until 1916 that the Articles of
War were amended to cover substantially the situation we have
now.
Nov; although this case is one of first impression and
the court has never decided this precise issue, as a matter of
fact there are only three or four decisions even in the
Court of Appeals on this issue —
Q

Is there a split in the cour ?

A

No, sir.

I think there are only two circuits

that have passed on this.

The Third Circuit and one other —

I don't recall which — they both came to the same conclusion
without very much of a discussion.

I think they just assumed

without any constitutional discussion at all on any of the
cases, they merely went to the Articles of War, noted that

9

1

the Articles of War did give jurisdiction over this sort of

2

offense and proceeded from that point.

3

single case ■— and I have checked the records where they are

4

available —- where any of this was raised by counsel.

5

I don't know of a

Now, in the Toth case and Covert against Reid and

6

Kinsella against Singleton and the McElroy case and Lee

7

against Madigan, the whole series of cases that were decided,

a

most of them after the Second World War, this court touched

9

upon a similar issue -- not touched upon — but discussed

io

at very great length a similar issue, namely, the jurisdiction

ii

of a court martial over people who were not members of the

12

armed forces and the history is quite familiar to this court

13

and I won't go into those cases now, except to note that there

14

was one theme which it seems to me ran through all of those

15

cases and that was the very deep concern shown by all of the

16

members of the court to prevent too broad an extension of

17

military jurisdiction.

18

And the court felt that unlike the Commerce Clause

19

or other provisions of the Constitution, which have been given

20

a very broad interpretation, that here so far as this clause

21

was concerned, the Constitution would be given a very narrow

22

interpretation.

23

And that view as I say was expressed in Covert

24

against Reid where the court said every extension of military

25

jurisdiction is an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the
10

1

civil courts and more important, acts as a deprivation of the

2

right to jury trial and other treasured constitutional

3

protection.

4

In Lee against Madigan also the court indicated its

5

reluctance to give military tribunals authority to try people

6

for a non-military offense.

7

And so, we are face to face with this problem now

8

and it seems to us that on the basis of the history that we

9

have before us, there is no justification for extending Juris­

10

diction of court martial over persons who commit ordinary

n

conventional civi. ian crimes where the courts are open,

12

perfectly capable of handling the case, where there are no

13

extraordinary circumstances such as war or some similar event

14

to make it impossible for these people to be handed over to

15

the civilian court for trial.

18

\

And as a matter of fact, the government in its brief

17

says that some 80 percent of these cases are tried in the

18

civilian courts, but apparently 20 percent are not.

Q

Where is it that you are drawing the line?

take it military offenses in either peace or war

I

you put

on one side.
A

If by military offenses we mean this sort of

thing which is directly and immediately concerned with the
military, yes.

In peace or war I would say that there is a

long tradition of court martial jurisdiction.
11

Q

1
2

What about so-called civil civilian crimes in

time of war?
A

3

I would argue if I had to that if the crime

4

is committed in this country where the civilian courts are

5

open and are available that it ought to be tried in the

6

civilian courts in that case also,, because I don't see any

7

particular reason why a soldier who is drunk and disorderly

8

in a camp in the United States should be tried by a military

0

court just because there happens to be a war 5,000 miles away.

As long as they are non-military crimes.

Yes.

A

15

18

All crimes are the same and should

be treated the same.

You wouldn't distinguish in any of these

I would say they should all be treated the same.

If they go into town and they get drunk and

there is a fight —
Q

In uniform.

A

I don't see that it makes any difference.

I

don't see any reason why the civil courts are not perfectly
capable of handling that situation.
Q

Don't you think the Army has some interest

in stopping their men from brawling in uniform?
25

12

1

A

I think the Army has an interest in that just

2

as I think the Army has an interest in seeing to it that wives

3

of servicemen stationed abroad don’t kill their husbands.

4

think the Army has an interest ■—

5

Q

The wives don't have uniforms on.

6

A

Pardon me?

7

Q

The wives don't have uniforms.

8

A

I don't think that that really should be the

9

decisive issue in determining whether or not a man is to be

10

deprived of a jury trial and the other protection of a

11

civilian trial.

12
13

Q

Well, then I would assume if they were brawling

on the post they would be entitled to a jury trial too.
A

14

I don't think so.

I admit that a line has to be

15

drawn somewhere and that seems to me to be a reasonable way

16

to draw the line.

17

lots of things —

18
19

I

I can understand that on a post there are

Q

What about drawing the line when he is net in

No, I don't think I would draw the line on whether

20
21

he is in uniform.

I am sure that Sargeant whatever his name

22

was, was probably in uniform when he filled out a false

23

income tax return, but I don't think that that determines the

24

question of whether he is to be tried in a civilian court or

25

not.
13

Q

In some of the cases in this field, hasn't it

been the question of status rather than where the crime has
been committed?
A

Yes.

Well, so far, the cases have all revolved

on the question of the status of the offendor. In this case
it might be said that the issue is the nature of the offense
as to whether it is what we have been calling a military
offense or a civilian offense.
Now I will admit in response to what Justice Marshall
said that there is an area in here, as there is in almost all
legal questions, which is marginal, but if I had to draw the
line I would say that if it committed off post

it may be

committed 1000 miles from post, it may be committed on Times
Square — I don't think that there is any reason why the
civilian authorities cannot try such a case, and why persons
engaged in this kind of a brawl, in or out of uniform, should
not be subjected to the civilian authority.
Q

Does your argument extend to people in the

military service who are overseas in time of peace?
A

I think that is a much more difficult problem.

Q

Well, I think so too.

A

Well, I would say that there is a much befctex-

I was asking you a

question.

argument for court martial jurisdiction there, although
even there, as your Honor may know, in too many cases these

14

1

matters are determined — let me interrupt one moment.

2

I would assume what we are talking about when we

3

say in time of peace, we are not talking about the United

4

States Army as an occupying force.

5

Americans who are stationed at an air base in Germany, for

6

example.

7

though it may be technically a time of peace, where the

8

Army -—

There is a difference where the Army is in, even

Q

9

We are rather talking about

Well, I would suppose that there is at least

10

a factual if not a juridical difference between a soldier in

11

South Vietnam and one in London, England today.
A

12

Yes.

In most cases I believe this matter is

13

handled now by treaty.

There is no doubt that if we look at

14

this historically the United States has always asserted the

15

right to try people who commit crimes abroad by techniques,

16

methods, other than civilian trial.

17

controversy was involved in that and that also was, I think,

18

affected by an extent by Covert against Reid.

The In re Ross

I would be inclined to think and I think this is a

19

20

matter of policy perhaps, rather than a constitutional

21

matter, perhaps a constitutional matter as well, that under

22

such cases the civilian courts of the country in which the

23
24
25

crime is committed just try the case.
case.

But that is not this

I really can't explore all these problems to their

outer liraits, because I think that the facts do vary from
15

1

time to time and as a matter of policy and as a matter of

2

treaty law I do think that in most cases these persons are

3

tried in the courts of the country in which the crime is

4

committed.

5

Q

I should think, Mr. Rabinowitz, thinking out loud

6

if you will, that your constitutional argument would

7

necessarily extend to military people overseas in time of

8

peace who commit basically what are civilian crimes.

S

A

I think that is probably so.

10

Q

Larceny and rape and murder and theft and

11

12
13
14
15

assault and battery against say the local civilian population.
A

Yes.

If we all assume that in Re Rose is no

longer the law, I think —
Q

Your constitutional right to jury trial is

that what you are talking about?

16

A

Your constitutional right to a jury trial.

17

Q

Where do you get that overseas?

13

A

It may be that he will have to be brought back

19

20
21
22
23
24
25

to the United States and there are provisions in the statute-Q

There are also treaties that govern the

disposition of cases.
A

Yes, sir.

It is my understanding that almost all

of these situations are covered by treaties.

I think some

of them are mentioned in the government's brief.
Q

I was just wondering why you give that point up

16

i

1

about overseas.

2

A

If I gave anything up your Honor, I didn’t do

3

it intentionally.

4

there are of course provisions in the statutes providing for

S

the trial in the United States of crimes which are committed

6

abroad.

7

I did not intend to give anything up, but

Now of course it would have to be a crime against the

8

United States and if an American — let's see the hypothesis

9

we are making — we are assuming that an American soldier,

10

for example, assaults or steals money from an English

tl

civilian, or from a German civilian, he being stationed there.
Q

\2

It gets a bit circular, doesn't it?

In your

13

submission, it might not even be a crime against the United

14

States.
A

15

It might not even be a crime against the United

States, yes, sir.

16

Now, the government doesn’t agree with this analysis

17
m

at all.

It takes the position that under the general

19

articles of the Articles of War, which is set forth on page 5

20

of my brief, court martials have always tried civilian

21

crimes, always, from the beginning.

22.

The article says, although

not mentioned specifically

23

in this chapter, all disorders and neglect to the prejudice

24

of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct

25

of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces and
17
■

I

crimes and offenses not capital may be subjected to a general
or summary court martial.

And I must say that the tax evasion

case that X referred to just a few moments ago was tried under
this section.
Now I am not going to raise the question of whether
that section isn't so vague that it could hardly be upheld
today, but the citation, the references quoted by the
government and it was really a magnificent bit of research,
all 115 cases or so listed in the Appendix, are supposed to be
cases in which the general article was used to punish civilian
crimes.
Now they start in 1775 and for example the first one
is that the soldier was charged with stealing.

The next one

says the soldier robbed Dr. Foster, General Hospital.
third one says the soldier stole a hat

The

from Captain Waterman.

Now these descriptions are so brief that you can't tell at
all whether the men are on duty or off duty at the time of
the offense.
One thing we can be sure of is that the civilian
courts were not open, because these crimes took place in
General Washington's army in 1775 in Cambridge, the first one
three weeks after the Battle of Bunker Hill.
New York.

In 1777 in Morristown.

In 1776 in

In 1778 in Valley Forge

at Fredericksburg and Yorktown. And then after the Treaty of
Paris they moved to the frontier where there are a series

18

of offenses against Indians.
Now no one is talking about the kinds of case where
the Army is in the course of a military campaign in the United
States or where there is a frontier battle going on.

Those

situations bear no ressemblance at all to this situation and
I think we are then talking about the war power and we have
a situation which is really quite different.
I might say that Winthrop in his authoritative work
comes to a completely different conclusion with respect to
the general article.

He says it was never used except very,

very sporatically on the frontier, but aside from that, it
was never used except when the offense was of a military
nature.
* *

Now, if the history is not conclusive, then mindful

of Mr. Justice Holmes' concurrence in Covert, I would like just
to note this:

In that opinion, the Justice said that the

crucial question is and I quote: "Which guarantees of the
Constitution should apply in view of the particular
circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible
alternatives which Congress had before it."
Now while that might have been a close question in
cases like Covert and Kinselia, there is nothing close about
it here.

The particular circumstances of the case is that

a soldier goes off base, off duty, commits a crime against
a civilian in Hawaii.

There is no reason at all why a

19

Hawaiian court can't try him.
The practical necessities are practically the same
and the possible alternatives are obvious.

No reason, no

compelling reason in policy, no reason why the Constitution
should not apply, appears in this case.
the government also disagrees.

Now here of course

It says the right of the

soldier to be tried in the Army community.

That is the

community he lives in and that is the community that he is
to be tried in.
Well, I wonder whether an average non-commissioned
officer tried by a court martial consisting of ranking officers
senior officers, officers with the rank of Colonel or Major,
or Captain, is being tried "in the Army community".
The government says there may be different standards
in the Army.

Well of -course there may be different standards

in the Army.

That is precisely what the difficulty is.

If the standards in the Army are more strict than
the standards in the community at large the soldier we think
has a right to complain, because he committed his crime in
the community and r.ot in the Army.

And if the standards in

the Army are less strict then we think that the community
has a right to complain, because the soldier should not
be permitted to come into town, into a civilian community,
commit crimes and then be excused because the Army doesn't
think those crimes are very serious.

Make it briefly if you will.

A

Just very briefly.

And that was raised in point

two of my brief, namely, some question as to whether Congress
has the power to punish this crime at all.
the crime is the crime of rape.

In other words,

There is nothing in the

statute that talks about rape in connection with military and
rape is a crime which is normally punished by the state.
And the mere fact that a man happens to be in the
armed forces would not seem to me to give the government the
right to punish him because he commits rape.
To put it another way, and as I say developed in
the brief, Congress can make it a crime to

embezzle property

of the United States, but I do not think that Congress can
make it a crime which said that anyone who was a federal
employee and who commits embezzlement anywhere is guilty
of a federal crime.

And I think that is what has been

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Springer.

ARGUMENT OF JAMES vanR. SPRINGER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SPRINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the
21

1

court, I think it is important in this case what we are

2

discussing is a constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the

3

Congress to legislate.

4

Clause 14 of Section 8 of Article I provides that

5

Congress has the jurisdiction to make rules for the government

6

and regulation of the land and naval forces.

7

It is our position that this power permitted Congress

Q

to legislate specific provisions in the Uniform Code of

9

Military Justice upon which Sargeant O'Callahan was convicted.

10

And we submit that Congress does have a concurrent jurisdiction

IT

with the civil authorities to punish offenses committed

12

by military personnel who are on active military status without

13

limitation as to whether or not the offenses are committed

14

on a military post or on duty.

*

In fact, the Uniform Code of Military Justice and

15
16

the Articles of War 1916, which in substance were in effect

17

until 1950, when the Code was enacted, have quite detailed

18

provisions relating to so-called non-military offenses.
The Code includes, of course, the offenses in

19

20

question in this case, rape, attempted rape, assault, house­

21

breaking.

22

principal offenses that servicemen might commit against the

23

civilian community, such as murder, larceny, bad check

24

offenses, drunken driving, reckless driving, disorderly

25

conduct, breech of the peace.

And it also covers specifically most of the other

22

1

As Mr. Rabinowita has suggested this jurisdiction

2

has been exercised and is being exercised in a great many

3

cases that arise both in the United States and abroad.

4

In the United States there are working arrangements

5

between the military and the civil authorities both the

6

Department of Justice and state and local authorities which

7

devide up the concurrent jurisdiction that exists under the

G

Uniform Code.

9

Generally speaking, the military dees turn offenders

10

against the civil laws over to the civil authorities, if the

1!

civil authorities request it.

12

Q

In this case the civil authorities had it.

13

A

The civil authority turned him over to the

14
15

military police, and they proceeded with the case.
Q

Getting back to the old theory of interfering

16

with the King's peace, how was the United States peace

17

interfered with in this case?

18

A

Mr. Justice Marshall, I would suggest that

19

the test should perhaps be framed in terms of the Constitution

20

which constitutes the government regulation of the land

21

and naval forces.

22

regulation of the land and naval forces is a reasonable amount

23

of control by the forces over the behavior of their members

24

when they are so to speak turned loose on communities.

We submit that one aspect of the government

What would the odds be?

7

A

The odds as to what would happen in that case

8

Do you know?

I am sure that the case would be handled by the authorities.

9

Q

Why?

10

A

Well, the policy of the Army and of the other

11

services is that ordinarily upon request offenders against

12

civilian law will be turned over to the civilian authorities.

13

Q

It has to be a request.

14

A

Yes, but I am sure—

15

Q

The G.I.’s constitutional right to a jury trial

16

depends on who makes the request.
A

17
18

Yes, yes, that certainly is the consequence

of the existence of this concurrent military jurisdiction.
In about 85 percent of the cases within the United

19

20

States in the year 1967, the civilian authorities in fact

21

did take jurisdiction over serious offenses.

22

something like 750 cases, serious cases, where the military

23

authorities did prosecute.

24

and I believe a clerical portion in the case of less serious

25

offenses.

Hut there were

American men are stationed in almost cases except for cases

4

involving only American personnel and cases involving crimes

committed while on duty, in those overseas cases there were

some 18,000 military prosecutions in the year 1967.

What is your view

of the tax evasion case?

statutory question.
Q

I take it that that might come under the 10 U.S.C.

be brought under that.
A

I am quite sure that is what it was brought

under, not knowing the case.
25

But, as I say, there may be some questions that are

not raised in this case.
Q

3

I don't want you to comment on another case, but

4

I would like to know whether you think there are any

o

restrictions of Congressional power in Article I, Section 8,

6

and what are they, because that clause empowers Congress to

7

make rules for the government and regulation of the land and

e

naval forces.

What I
You say

that Congress could make any rules whatever that they wanted
to.

I suppose those rules could be preclusive of civilian

A

Again, we don't have a preclusion case here.

I

think that would be a very troublesome case.
Q

If you try to confine our discussion here to

this particular case, you are going to leave me substantially
without the benefit of your assistance.
A

I think I would have to say if the military or

Congress purported to preclude state jurisdiction over some
of these crimes, that would certainly be a difficult case.
I think the question here is framed and perhaps to
my mind should be restricted to the question whether legis­
lation can, as the plaintiff asserts, deprive the individual
defendant of his jury right.

It is not a jurisdictional

crisis between the military authorities and the states.
Q

Then you say Congress could not, under this

constitutional provision, set up a system of rules that would
be preclusive of the civilian authority in some respects.
I am trying to find out what the phrase "government
and regulation of land and naval forces" means in terms of
your submission as counsel for the government.
A

I do have to confess that I am troubled and

I hate to make a commitment as to the most extrema application
that this could be given.

Is there any First Amendment limitation upon the

power of Congress?

13

the last couple of years, arisen in the Court of Military

14

Appeals. The Court of Military Appeals has held that that right

15

does exist.

fl 6

Q

Under the Constitution?

17

A

Yes.

The Court of Military Appeals has said as

16

flatly as could be said that the Constitution operates

19

directly —

20

Q

Then I will ask you one more question.

I take

21

it then from what you have said that it is your submission

22

that Article 1, Section 8, Clause 14, authorizes the Congress

2:

to make a complete set of criminal rules, which we ordinarily

r

refer to as criminal rules, applicable to the persons by

5

virtue of their status as members of the land and naval forces
28

of

the United States.

It would include, for example, the power

of

Congress to make it a crime not to submit their income tax

returns on time.
A

I think I would have to say it would be our

position that the power could do that, could go that far.
Although, of course, I would say again that I don't think it
is necessary to go that far to decide this case or really the
general problem raised by this case.
Q

Maybe you and I think differently because I

have to think beyond the limits in the individual case.

I

guess you do too, don't you really?
A

Yes, indeed.

And of course this case does involve

the general principle, but it does not involve the furthest
most exercise of jurisdiction that might be conceived of.
The question is then whether the government in
regulation of land and naval forces can encompass activities
by soldiers beyond what in the narrow sense can be called
military, obdience, behavior in formation and things like that.
We submit that there are good reasons why this juris­
diction should go further.

Activities, actions of the kind

in question in this case do have, in a very real sense, a
military significance that makes them a proper concern of
tha military forces.
The fundamental factor here is the fact that the
military is and always has been in our society a kind of

29

1

unique community that is governed by rules and customs of its

2

own and it is separate from the civilian community and in some

3

respects alien to it.

4

The real community of the people in the services is

5

the community of other people in the semces.

5

civilian community where a particular military base with

7

its transient personnel happens to belocated.

8
9

It is not the

Of course, the existence of a military unit in a
civilian community presents certain problems for that community

10

Military people in fact are often a different kind or a

11

different make-up of ages, and attitudes.

12

young people without local ties, without family roots in the

13

community, who in their free time do,as a matter of practical

14

fact, create problems for that community.

15

community righly looks to the military to maintain some degree

16

of control over what these people do in the community.

17

There are frequently

I think that

And of course general discipline is something that

10

is of enormous significance to an effectively functioning Army.

19

I think to the extent that soldiers who are sometimes off

20

duty what they do during those off duty hours does have an

21

impact on the operations of the military force and the

22

existence of an effective discipline.

23

One factor involved in civilian punishment of military

24

offenders against the civilian laws is that those civilian

25

punishments, the delays in civilian trials, may well interfere
30

1

with the operation of a military unit by making the man

2

unavailable for transfer, unavailable for the performance of

3

his military duties.

4

The Army has special facilities, special abilities

5

because of the nature of the community that it is, for the

6

punishment and rehabilitation of members of the forces who may

have gone astray.

ment for a military man can be much more lenient than any

10

punishment that would be available to the civilian courts and

11

the civilian authoritis".

12

Finally, a point that Mr. Rabinowitz —

13

Q

What is the general scheme, or has been under

14

the Articles of War?

15

the civilian penalties for a comparable crime?

16

A

Yes.

Do they set up different penalties from

In fact, the Articles of War in general

17

as to most of these crimes, as to all but two or three, simply

18

say, as a matter of statute, that punishment shall be as the

19

court martial shall direct.

20

which is in form an Executive Order at present specifies maximum

21

penalties, generally I believe, not minimum penalties.

A

In fact the maximum penalty available under

It

Q

We don’t know wh&t it was in Hawaii then.

12

A

No, I would suspect it was something of that

13

magnitude that would have been available in the civilian law

14

that I am familiar with.

15

I think there is a very real practical point here that

16

the factors that basically underlie the jury right, the right

17

of an individual to be tried and judged by members of his

13

community don’t fully apply in practical fact in the case of

19

the military man who against his will his often dragged to

20

a cc-gnmwnihy where he has no ties, where he doesn’t want to be,

21

where in fact there may be for one reason or another a strong

22

community bias against him.

23

So, I am just suggestinc there may be some cases where

24

in fact the military man does benefit from a military trial as

25

distinguished from a civilian trial.

32

1

Q

Have you been to an Army court martial?

2

A

No, I have not,

3

Q

Now I can see v/hy you say it.

4

A

But in fact I

<

am told and, of course, there is

5

nothing in the record to support this, that generally a

6

comparison of the cases of civilian crimes tried by court

7

martial with those tried by civilian courts indicates that

8

more lenient penalties are given out, generally by the court

9

martial, and this, I am sure, is conditioned by the fact that

to

a more lenient penalty can, in some cases, be effective

11

against the military man, where that kind of penalty wouldn’t

12

make sense --

13

Q

They cut them

when they go up on appeal.

14

A

Yes, there are several stages of review within

15

the military scheme and sentences in fact can be reviewed

16

all the way up to the top in the military.

17

Along this line, I think it is important to bear in

18

mind that the Uniform Code and specifically the approach that

19

has been taken by the Court of Military Appeals, does assure a

20

military man

21

sxist in civil trials, except, of course, for the requirement

22

of indictment and the right to a trial by jury.

23

24
25

virtually all of the constitutional rights that

With respect to the history upon which the petitioner
put so much weight, we think that the research is reflected
in our brief does, in fact, show that the framers of the
33

i

1

Constitution were familiar with, or had reason to be familiar

2

with the fact that court martials contemporaneously were used

3

to punish crimes which could not be regarded as purely military

4

in the sense for which the petitioner contends.

5

To be sure, some of the crimes listed in the appendix

6

to our brief, it may be a little hard to tell which they were,

7

but there are certainly a great many of them as to which it is

8

clear that they were what the petitioner would, call non-military

9

or civilian in offenses.
For example, cashing a bad check in a civilian

provision in the 1916 Articles of War laying out specific
jurisdiction over specific non-military crimes was something
novel.

This is something that existed prior to the

ratification of the Constitution and, in fact, existed over
the years under the general article of the Articles of War
up until 1916.
So, it is not a new jurisdiction.

It is one that

must have been in the contemplation of the framers.
Q

Tell me as a matter of interest, what is the

source of material of this remarkable appendix you have.
A

In fact, this was done by the Army.

Some of the

records, most of them appear in the National Archives.
Q

If one wanted to go and look at the source of

25
34

1

materials to see the context in which the case arose, where would

a

you go?

3

.

Does your brief show that?
A

Yes.

Generally it is in the National Archives.

4

At least there is one instance where it is the library at

5

West Point, or some of the record»kept at West Point, but most

6

of these are available in the Archives.
I think although

7

it is right to say this is a case

G

of first impression, it is important to consider this case in

9

the light of the cases where the court has considered the certainly

10

not unrelated question of jurisdiction over civilians.

'11

Q

May I ask you this?

Let's suppose that a member

12

of the armed forces in civilian uniform while on furlough

13

cashed a bad check at a store in a civilian community.
Now, is it your construction of the Constitution that

14
15

court martial jurisdiction would be authorized?

16

A '

Yes.

17

Q

Have I made myself clear?

18

A

Yes.

19

Though perhaps there is the distinction

as to the location of the offense.
Q

20

What do you mean by that?

I am stating to you

21

that there is a check cashed in a store.

24
25

Let me particularize

Let's suppose it was a clothing store, a men's clothing

A

Mr. Justice, I think conceivably a line could

be drawn according to whether the soldier in question was

1
35

stationed in the Memphis community —
Q

Suppose he wasn't?

I am not asking you that»

I am asking you for your constitutional theory.

Does the

phrase "government and regulation of the sea and land forces
of the United States" authorize Congress by statute to
provide for the prosecution of this man in civilian clothes
for this particular offense.
A

Yes, it does.

But I can see that a distinction

could be drawn as to the scope of the jurisdiction to govern
and regulate the land and naval forces according to the
geographic distance perhaps between where the individual is
stationed and where he commits his crime.
I think there is —
Q

You have to take the position, if I understand

you, that if a distinction were drawn, it would be incorrect,
it would be in violation of the Constitution.

Do you not say

that?
A

I say that the jurisdiction extends that far,

but I think I can say, one might say, that the government and
*

~

regulation of the land and naval forces properly includes
the relationship between a military unit and the community
in which it is located.
Q

You don't take that position?

A

No, I am not insisting on that position,

Q

It doesn't make any difference to you whether

36

1

the man was on furlough or whether he was AWOL or whether he

2

was just out for a night on the town?

3
4

A

It does not, but I could conceive that it might

to someone else..

5

I think one of the problems in this case, of course,

6

is if you try to draw a circle around military offense.

7

is a i.i1 itary offense.

8

of a WAC in uniform on a military post a military offense or

9

not.

To take the problem of rape:

Is rape

I think you can play with all of these various factors.

10

Q

11

question, isn't it?

12

A

That is not one of the questions, that is the

Yes, it is certainly a question that necessarily

13

follows from the position that the petitioner is putting

14

forth in this case.

15

Q

16
17

What

If you correct there can be a constitutional

difference, what limits do you ask us to put upon this then?
A

Well, I think the Constitution does have to be

18

read as leaving to the judgment of the legislature of Congress

19

as to how far this jurisdiction shall extend.

20
21

22

Q

If Congress authorizes this, then there is

no constitutional question.
A

Yes.

But I think if you say anything short of

23

that, even if you just say as to rape of a civilian, there is

24

no jurisdiction.

25

of where the line does exist.

I think you are necessarily in the question

37

1
! 2

If you say there is no limit other than the good
judgment of the legislature, then you don't have this problem

3

of course.

4

a military offense, even if you try to do it quite narrowly.

5

I think this is a problem.

!6
i 7

Q

But I think — it is not easy to define what, is

I thought the quest of your argument was as

far as the Constitution is concerned the framers intended to

Q

leave these complicated questions, these line-drawing

9

instructions to the Congress, and that in interpreting the

10

language of the Constitution on its face in that regard, that

11

there is nothing inconsistent in that interpretation with the

12

past history, Colonial and subsequent history, of the practice

13

of court martial.

14

Isn't that the guts of your argument?

15

A

Yes, that certainly is, Mr. Justice.

16

Q

I should think an answer to the Chief Justice's

17

question and my brother Fortas' questions would have to stand

18

on that position.

19

20
21

A

Yes, I do, though I think in this particular case

we might even come under a less sweeping statement —
Q

There mic,ht be room in a given case, some of

22

the hypotheticals, for you to construe Congressional statutes

22

to the Articles of War or the Army regulations in a narrow

i ■

way, but that is

r

A

only scope there, isn't it?

Certainly our position does rest upon the
38
i

t

I

existence of a jurisdiction that is limited only by the good
sense of the legislature.
Of course that I think was the historical issue in
England, realistically, whether the King should be able to
determine the jurisdiction of court srartials, or whether
Parliament did.
The one thing that our Constitution decided was that
it was the legislature, not the executive, who would have the
authority to determine this jurisdiction, but X think that
the jurisdiction given the legislature was a broad one.
Arid that, of course, although admittedly it was a
different issue, that is what this court said in Kinseila
against Singleton.

It said, "the test is the status of the

accused, whether or not it was a military mar. when he committed
the crime and when he was tried."
I think it is very hard to understand the case
\

decided at the same time in Kinseila involving civilian
employees who were, by all tests, in effect, operating as
members of the military forces.

^
\

In McEiroy against Guagliardo the court said that *
although a civilian was in this working relationship since
he did not have military status there was not court martial
jurisdiction over him.
I think any test other than status makes it very
hard to understand the connection that was drawn in that case.
