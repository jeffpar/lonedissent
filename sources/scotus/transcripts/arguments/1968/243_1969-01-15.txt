ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. MAC LAURY, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. MAC LAURY:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

8

the Court, my point of argument is to spend 25 minutes on the

9

opening and then reserve, if the Court please, five minutes

10

for rebuttal.
.

n

This case comes here from the District Court in the

12

District of Arizona on direct appeal under the Expediting Act.

13

It sets for the first time the validity under the antitrust

H

laws of a newspaper operating agreement.

15

The agreement binds
i
the commercial assets and the functions of two newspapers in

16

Tucson, Arizona, the MORNING AND SUNDAY STAR and the EVENING

17

CITIZEN.

18

Agreements of this kind have become increasingly

19

necessary to preserve competition between newspapers on the

20

journalistic level.

21

because Tucson cannot support two newspapers operating at both

22

the journalistic and the commercial level.

*JO

The reason the agreement was adopted is

Now, this situation is not peculiar to Tucson. Over

24

tiie past 30 or 40 yenrs there has been a drastic decline in the

25

number of separately owned newspapers in fche same city.

3

In

1

In 1920 there were 552 cities having separately owned

2

newspapers.

3

By the mid-360s there were 65, and of these 65 more than

4

one-third operated under agreements such as the one under

5

consideration here.

6

Twenty years later, in 1940, there were only 181,

Now, the Government claims that this agreement is a

7

per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the

8

District Court on summary judgment held that it was in fact a

9

violation, a per se violation of Section 1.
It is our contention that the agreement in substance

10
11

and effect was a merger and thcit the coux*t should have judged

12

it under the rule of reason and, specifically, it should

13

apply to this agreement the failing-company doctrine, because

14

CITIZEN in 1940 was truly in a failing condition.
Now, we do not seek here to justify per se

15
16

violations.

The Government argued the law, and it argues in

17

its brief here that all we seek to do is to justify per se

18

violations.

19

that is not our position.

20

lawful and would have been found lawful had it been examined

21

under the rule of reason rather rather than on summary

22

judgment and under the per se rules.

I would just like to emphasize to the Court that
We feel the agreement is highly

This case involves a typical situation of the

23
24

•economic conditions experienced by newspapers throughout the

25

country,

in 1940 CITIZEN was in fact a failing company.

4

It

I

had not paid dividends for many years.

Its liabilities far

2

exceeded its assets, and it had been kept alive and able to

3

pay its bills only by contributions from the stockholders.

4

contrast, its competitor, the MORNING STAR, was in good

S

financial condition.

6

selling more than 50 percent of the advertising in Tucson,

It was a strong competitor.

It was

7

Q

What were the respective circulations?

8

A

The respective circulations in 1939 were

■9

approximately 2,000 apart.

’JO

was approximately 12,000, the CITIZEN approximately 10,000,

11

But, in addition, the STAR had a 12,000 circulation of its

12

Sunday edition, which the CITIZEN did not have.

13

In

The daily circulation of the STAR
1

Those figures are approximations, but there has

14

always been from 1932 on through 1939 a variation of 1,500 to

m

1,800 to 2,000 difference in its circulation.

16
17

Nov/, as I say, in contrast, the STAR was making a
profit and sold 50 percent more advertising than the CITIZEN,

18

Q

But the STAR had a Sunday edition.

19

A

A Sunday edition.

20

Q

Because otherwise the circulations aren't really;
\

i

21

that far apart, are they?

Except for the Sunday edition,

22

why wouldn't you think one paper should do as well as the

23

other advertising-wise?

.

1

24

A

i think it was due in large measure to the

Sunday edition, but not entirely, Mr, Justice,

There was,

1

of course, available to the STAR a combination rate between

Sunday and Monday and Saturday and Sunday.

advantage.

it could have sold out or merged with the STAR.

0

It could have ceased publication and shut down its
Or

The evidence was undisputed that CITIZEN in that

10

failing condition could not have been sold to an outside

11

competitor, because no outside competitor would have wanted to

12

come in and place itself in the shoes of a failing company

13

against an established newspaper such as the STAR.

14

Now, it took neither of these courses, but instead

15

took the third, course.

agreement with the STAR, which preserved for the citizens of

17

Tucson and for these newspapers two separate rival, competing

18

editorial voices.

19

far more preferable choice, far more preferable course of

20

conduct than to have merged entirely and shut down this

21

competing voice of the CITIZEN.

22

That was to enter into an operating

And it our contention here that was a far,

So they entered into this operating agreement, which

23

was premised on the basic economic fact in the newspaper

as the personnel, the records, and all of the material devoted

12

and used at the commercial level of these two businesses.

S3

On the other hand,, the separate identities of the

14

STAR and CITIZEN were retained, and the agreement specified

15

that the STAR and CITIZEN would continue to be published

16

separately.

17

indeed, the STAR and CITIZEN have continued in rival

developed into two high-quality newspapers.
The agreement was patterned after what we refer to

2?

as the Albuquerque Agreement, which was then in effect and

22

which is still in effect.

23

It was adopted in 1933.

The purpose of the operating agreement was to merge

24

these commercial functions and assets so as to support two

25

separate news and editorial voices.

7

To do this the parties

They established advertising rates.

They had a separate

Department, with nothing to do with the editorial levels of the
two newspapers.

It was a separate operation.

We urged the District Court, because this was in
substance and effect a merger or a consolidation, to judge the
agreement under the rule of reason.
8

But this it refused to do.

1

It was the District Court's view that the failing- company

2

doctrine would have applied in this situation if STAR had

3

acquired CITIZEN outright and published both newspapers as a

4

single owner.

5

transaction would not have been unlawful if the newspapers had

6

gone further than they did and eliminated all news and

7

editorial rivalry.

Thus, the Court ruled, in effect, that the

deals with newspapers exempts the activities of the papers from

10

the antitrust laws.

11

consider the Sherman Act as requiring the elimination of a

12

separate and effective editorial voice*

13

the fact that there was a separate voice, that there were

14

two editorial voices, in Tucson should have been a factor that !

15

the Court should have taken under consideration in deciding

16

whether or not this agreement was unreasonable.

But we do urge that the District Coiirfc

The benefit to the community deriving from separate

editorial voices is a factor that the Court take into

consideration.

We do not claim here that there was a violation of
the First Amendment.

That argument should have taken into account

that there was another effective editorial voice.

suggest that this is a First-Amendment consideration?

25

A

Does that

Yes, it is a First-Amendment consideration,
9

because the Court had the choice here of interpreting the

2

Sherman Act so as to permit two separate editorial voices.

Yes, but our argument was that here the Court

said it would be perfectly lawful *— you could have put these

12

two newspapers together and took down one voice, and in that

13

event the Sherman Act would not have been violated.

You really are just arguing the importance of

the business to the community.

That is correct.

Q

You could make the same argument with respect

to any other business if you thought it was very important to
the community,

I think that that is correct.
10

We argue here

1

this is a factor that should have been taken into consideration

under the rule of reason.

3

Q

It was decided on summary judgment, wasn't it.

4

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

Are there issues of fact?

8

A

There was a serious and a genuine issue of fact

7

on the motion for summary judgment.

We filed numerous affi­

8

davits, and the intent of all of them was that this was a

9

merger.

That was the primary issue of fact, the disputed issue

10

of fact, which the Court ignored on motion for summary

11

judgment.

Certainly, we all agree on both sides of this case
11

that the Sherman Act does deal with economic realities and with

Now, the Government charged that this agreement

constituted price-fixing and profit-pooling and market

6

the complete answer to these charges is that the owners of

could not be rehabilitated and reconstituted after years of

question about it — CITIZEN clearly was a failing company

And the District Court just found to the

contrary?

IS

The District

16

Court found in Finding 17 — or I will say concluded in

Finding 17 **« that CITIZEN was not in 1940 on the verge of

18

going out of business and that it would not have ceased

19

publication but for the opportunity offered in crus operating

20

agreement.

j
21

Now, I do not consider that to be a finding, that

22

CITIZEN was not a failing company.

23

Mr. Small, the majority owner of the CITIZEN, was prepared to

24

finance the losses of CITIZEN for some little time out of his

25

own pocket.

That is in Finding 14.
13

The evidence was that

But the evidence also was that he had to find another
2

source or resources in order to keep CITIZEN alive,

3

Q

At that time did he move to Tucson,

Did he

4

devote his full time and attention to the business for very

5

long?
A

6

He had moved to Tucson, I believe, in about

7

September of 1939 and had given his full time and attention to

8

the business without a salary for about six months.
The Court found—

bought it?

12
13

Q

It continued to fail, to deteriorate.
In December of 1939 the current liabilities of the

14
15

CITIZEN were $47,000, and its current assets were $16,500,

16

Its total liabilities in December of *39 exceeded total assets
\
by $53,000, Its total, assets were $80,000.

17

By March of 1940 its total liabilities exceeded

18
19

assets by $81,000.

20

$54,000.

21

And its total assets had declined to

By June of 1940, just before the opeating agreement

22

went into effect, the total assets of CITIZEN had declined

23

further from $54,000 of the previous March to $47,000.

24
25

Q

Do you think it was in as bad a shape in '36 as

it was in 340 and as bad in '40 as it was in *36?
14

A

i

2

No, I think it was in worse shape in 1940 than

it was in 1936.
In 1936 Mr. Small and Mr. Johnson acquired the

3
4

newspaper from the Hitchcock estate.

They acquired it for

5

$100,000, which they paid over a period of time.

6

they put $25,000 into new capital.

At that time

The debts of the corporation were at that time

7
S

approximately $7,500.

9

were $109,000, and $79,000 of this was due to its stockholders,

By 1940 the debts of the corporation

10

which represented the new money put into the enterprise by

11

the stockholders.
So, clearly, CITIZEN was steadily declining

12
13

financially from 1936 through 1940.
Q

14

There weren’t any efforts after 1940 or any time

to find any other buyer for the newspaper?

I might point out here that the undisputed testimony

at the trial was that CITIZEN could not have been sold in

1940 to an outside publisher who had any expectation of

9

operating a newspaper at a profit.

10

Q

Mr. MacLaurv, what was the situation as to

In other words-””

1965 was not the termination date.

It still had some

But the evidence was, in the form of a pro forma

20

statement prepeired by a national accounting firm — the

21

evidence was that CITIZEN and STAR as newspapers were healthy

22

companies making a profit.

23

Q

What was the termination date?

24

A

The termination date had been set forward in

25

1953 to 1993, I believe.

But there was a provision that even
16

1

that was the termination date, it couldn’t even have been

2

terminated then except by agreement by both parties»

3

really didn’t have a specific termination date unless both

4

parties at the end of each 25-‘year period would agree to

3

terminate it.

So it

6

The evidence was that in 1965 if this agreement

7

should be abrogated*, in the sense that the District Court

8

ordered it, that CITIZEN would promptly again slump towards a

9

failing company.

For the years ’62f *63 and '64, the test

period, the evidence was ~~ and it was undisputed — that

11

CITIZEN would lose on the average of $75„000 a year, that

STAR was in a far stronger position and would have earned

13

between $450^000 and $500,000.

the parties to the operating agreement to reduce costs and

In addition to this testimony at the trial* we have

15

in this record a rather unusual document* which is Government

16

Exhibit No. 26* which was a submission that the STAR made in

17

1947 to the Internal Revenue Service in support of excess-

18

profits tax relief for the war years.

19

to the Court a couple of things that the STAR said in this

20

document about the purpose of 1940 agreement.

21

At page 409 they saids

I would like to read

“It is obvious that the aim

22

and purpose of the parties was to destroy every vestige of

23

the competition that existed on January 1, 1940.“

24
25

Then at pages 420 and 421 they saids

“In order to

preserve perpetual elimination of competition the operating
19

1

agreement provides that neither of these papers will engage in

2

publication of any other newspaper in Tucson.'5

3

On the next page, in rather large type at the bottom

4

of the page, they told what the purpose was, and they said?

5

"And these two papers, the ARIZONA STAR, did" — in large

6

letters, underlined «- “did eliminate all competition from the

7

local newspaper field on that day."

3

Q

What page is that?

9

A

421, Mr. Justice.

10

Finally, I would like to invite the Court’s

ii

attention to these little pictures at page 424 of the record,

12

in which the STAR graphically displays what the result of

13

this agreement was.

14

one labeled "THE STAR" and the other labeled “THE CITIZEN."

15

At the edges of the picture we have two troughs, one labeled

"Circulation" and one labeled "Advertising."1

Now, I would, like to suggest to the Court a
hypothetical situation, because I think it illustrates the
basic argument that they are making here»
Let us assume we had two newspapers in town and both

5

of them were losing money and the publishers of both

6

newspapers got together and said;

7

are both losing money.

8

for both of us substantially to increase our rates."

9

shook hands on it, and they said:

10
11

“Things are terrible.

We

The best solution to this problem is

”Fine.

They

We*11 do this the

first of next month.”
Then they decided themselves what the rate level

12

would be and said:

"Well, let’s turn it over to a third

13

person to fix the fix the rates."

14

It seems to me that two things are clear.

15

First, they could not possibly offer any defense to

16

this as a per se violation.

It is clearly per se.

17

Secondly, they could not attempt to justify this

13

type of arrangement on the plea that this was necessary to

19

preserve the companies.

20

Q

21

22

A

With regard to the picture?

23

Q

424.

24

A

No, Mr. Justice, there was no objection taken to

25

Was any plea of self-incrimination raised in

the introduction of this document.
22

Nov/, there was the next thing that they did, which

1

.

2

they said was essential to this arrangement.

They had what we

3

think was held correctly by the District Court to be a legal

4

profit-pooling arrangement in here.

3

operations of the papers — what they did was that the Tucson

6

Newspapers, Inc,, received all the revenues, that is, the

7

revenues from the sales of advertising and circulation.

8

Then after the expenses of putting out the paper, the revenues

9

were divided between the two papers, not on the basis of what

The proceeds of the

10

each one contributed but according to a fixed formula, Tnat is,

11

without, regard to whether one contributed more or one

12

contributed less, they divided it up according to a preordained

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22

formula.
Q

Do you mean they contributed it in the sense

of gross—
A

Of gross revenues, that's right,

Q

Did the managing company itself determine what

circulation expenses would be?
A

Oh, yes.

I mean, subject, of course — these

two companies obviously had basic control-—Q

Did any sales expenses, like pushing circulation

or pushing advertising or pushing subscriptions — was that
determined by that company?
A

That was determined by Tucson Newspapers, Iric,,

because it took over for these two newspapers the circulation
23

1

and the advertising, the business effects of the thing.
Haw, this, it seems to us, has the very obvious

2
3

effect of deterring the incentive of each paper to take

4

whatever steps might increase its circulation, because

5

obviously if one paper decided to try to increase its

6

circulation, a large part of that immediately flows over to

7

the other.

10

ii
12

Finally, although it is not terribly important in
this case — we are not stressing it

-*- the third agreement

provision they had was an undertaking that neither of them
would go into any publishing business in Tucson.
How, the question as we see the case is whether

13

these three restraints, which, it seems to us, are the type

14

that this court traditionally has treated as per se and the

15

purpose of which, as the Court found, and the effect of which

18

was to eliminate all commercial competition between the two

21

24

25

papers, somehow is taken out of the operation of these rules
because of the claim that this was necessary to save a failing
newspaper in 1S40.
Q

What wrong do you think that the antitrust

laws leave for the common fact that newspapers all over this
country as a result of competition are getting smaller and
smaller in number?

In New York City, through competitive

factors, we have got a practical monopoly in the newspaper
field, at least in the morning field.
24

1

Now, do you think that those hard economic facts

2

find any room for play or recognition under the antitrust

3

laws?

4

ordinary and conventional antitrust doctrine?

Or does this case have to be judged in terms of

A

I would like to make two points in answer,

Mr. Justice»
First of all, it seems to us — and I think Your

8

Honor has put the case fairly — but it seems it seems to us

9

what they are really suggesting in this case is that the

10

normal antitrust principles that apply to all industries

1!

should somehow be treated somewhat differently because of the

12

peculiar characteristics of the newspaper business.

13
14
15

Q

I am not talking law now.

I am talking

economics, I suppose, or practicalities.
Here, as a result of all this, you have got a strong

IS

newspaper, one strong newspaper in a small community, which

17

through this device has preserved competition in ideas,

18

competition in its editorial policies.
I would like to make two answers to that.

First, there is a disagreement, as we have developed

21

in our brief, among authorities as to the causes of the

22

problems of the newspaper industry.

24

people who believe that perhaps with new technology things

25

may improve.

Admittedly, there has

But on the application stare decisis, not

theory that it was not appropriate in the circumstances to —

19

I would just like to stress hare that pleas often made to the

20

Court, of course, that rules of law should not be changed by

21

the Court but should be changed by the Congress.

22
23

But in this

case Congress for two years has had this very problem before
it.

There has been pending now in the Congress for two years

various bills that would specifically sanction this type of

agreement for the newspapers.

That is the next point after I answer

Mr, Justice-»-"

on these questions, if this record is clear, if the CITIZEN was

Q

Do I understand now that you argue on the

13

assumption of whether this newspaper than became one voice or

14

two voices?

15

A

We say it is not a merger, Mr. Justice,

16

Q

As to ’whatever it was.

17

A

There were still two editorial voices.

What voras it?

1 mean after the merger*

The

18

two papers, the Court found, continued to operate as separate

19

editorial voices.

We don't question that,

20

Q

Were they owned by the same people?

Eli

A

No.

They continued to be separately owned, but

22

they did have this interrelationship between them on the

23

business level.

24
25

Q

Can we assume, then, that the Government does

not claim and would make no claim that there would be any
27

1

connection between news policy and this joint commercial

2

operation.

3

A

Well,

row,

Mr. Justice, we do suggest that we

4

have in our brief that the likely tendency of this type of

5

commercial operation may be to inhibit competition in news.

6

But we don't say that it has here, but there the tendency of

7

it — in other words, the people who have this interrelationship

8

on the business level and who have had removed some of the

9

incentives for trying to increase their business——

10

Q

What do you suppose the managing company would

11

do if one of the papers because of its news coverage policy

12

suddenly began to decline in its circulation seriously?

I don't know what they would do.

I suppose

they would attempt to persuade that paper to improve itself, I
would think.
I would like to come now to this whole question of
the failing company, because that, of course, is the foundation
on which their entire argument rests.
CITIZEN was a failing company.

They claim in 1940 the

Of course, if that underpinning

falls, it seems to us, so does their whole case.
Now, the District Court found «— and this is at
page 72, the second sentence —* it said that at the time they
entered into the operating agreement, Citizen Publishing was
not then on the verge of going out of business.
Q

Where is it?

Yes, we do, Mr. Justice,

And I would like to

refer to eight or nine specific items which we think support
it.
But before doing that I would just like to say one
thing, because they challenged this in the brief.

The evidence

to which I am going to refer was not admitted, of course, on
the motion for the summary judgment.

At the time of the

summary judgment it was decided on affidavits.

This evidence

came in in course of the trial on the Section 2 issues.

It was

offered with respect to intent.
However, it seems to us that all the evidence that is
relevant to the failing-company defense was introduced.

I thought the Government had been taking the

IS

In view of all the evidence-—

Q

Because there was a trial on other issues and

summary judgment matter.
A

There are only two items of evidence that they

claim they should have had the right to introduce on the
question of failing-company that was not introduced.

We think

neither of those is relevant.
First is some statistics to the financial condition

16

17

A

evidence was introduced which was very relevant to this

12

S3

I think that your position is that in view of

of the CITIZEN in the 1920s.

That, it seems to us, is too

remote.
?3
19

20
21
22
23

24
25

Secondly is some statements by various people in the
Tucson area, which were printed in the record, as to the
importance of having two papers in Tucson.

Again, it seems to

us, that is irrelevant.
Now let me come to the specific issues.

I would

like to start with something, because the argument is put in
terms of failing-company is that it was a failing company, and
31

1

they say — basically Mr® MacLaury sayss

2

balance sheet®

3

"Just look at the

That's enough®”

Now, "failing-company” is really a shorthand phrase,

4

we think®

5

basic concept that when a company is in such serious

6

condition and has such serious problems that it appears that

7

it is about to go out of the market anyhow, then its

8

acquisition by a competitor does not substantially lessen

9

competition.

' ’Failing-company1' is a shorthand phrase for the

10

Q

But it is a viable economic unit?

n

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

12

Q

Which is a different question than asking

13
14

whether it is viable in the hands of this management®
A

But I think, Mr. Justice — I suggest that this

IS

management is willing to keep it going.

16

a viable entity in terms of the purpose of the failing-company

17

defense; that is, the entity is able to keep going. If the

18

man is willing to keep it going for awhile, it seems to me that

19

refutes the claim that its elimination through merger will not

20

substantially lessen competition®

21

Now let me come to—

22

Q

23

It is for that time

But even if he wasn’t willing to keep it’going,

it would still—

24

A

Surely.

Surely.

23

Let me come to these iteras of evidence®
32

Yes, it would

1

Q

It is your position, then, that even though a

corporation might foe suffering substantial financial losses,

3

with no prospect of any change in the downward curve, if all of

4

its stock happens to be owned by a multimillionaire who just

S

likes the idea of owning a corporation that publishes a

6

newspaper and is willing to take those losses, perhaps off­

7

setting them against other income of his own, that that is no

8

sense a failing company?
A

9

That is correct, Mr, Justice,

I would like to point out that there are many of

10
11

these situations where the publisher may have hopes of

12

rehabilitating the paper—
Q

Your hypothesis, then, is that he has no

15

A

Mo hopes,

10

Q

He is just stubborn or eccentric or vain or

13
14

hopes—

17

something and likes to have editorials in the paper praising

18

him, and even though it loses a million dollars—

19

20
21
22

A

That is right, because it continuing as an

operating entity in the market.
Now, if I: may, X would just like to corae to these
items of evidence that we have here.

2 <3J

Q

But did he contribute to it?

24

A

He did, for many years.

25

First of all, the initial overtures about making this

k

33

1

arrangement came not from the CITIZEN, which allegedly was

2

the failing company, but from the other paper, from the STAR.

3

Now, this is directly in contrast to the International Shoe

4

case, where the overtures came from the failing company.

5

It seems to us that this is of some significance because

6

normally if a company feels that it can't go on, it would take

7

the initiative.

8
9

Now, in the International Shoe case this court found
that the controlling purpose of International Shoe in

10

acquiring the Me£1wain Company, the failing company there, was

11

to get additional plants for its business which it could not

12

then quickly hope to make.

And its discussion of what it was

13

holding as to the acquisition of the company in those

14

circumstances would not violate Section 7 it put in as a

15

qualification, in the passage which the Appellant themselves

18

quoted in their brief, at page 41, that the purpose of the

17
18

competitor there was not — and I quote — "not with a
purpose to lessen competition."

And that, of course, is

13

exactly the opposite of the purpose the District Court found

20

was involved here.

21

22
23
24
25

Now, initially, in 1936, Small purchased only a
25-percent interest in the paper.

Over the next three years

he increased his share in the paper from 25 to 85 percent.
It has been suggested that he made attempts to
finance the paper and that they were unsuccessful in this
34

*
3

interval

2

attempts — here merely spoke to three people he knew, a

3

retired man. a man who had just moved to Arizona and asked

4

him wouldn’t he perhaps like to put some money into the paper,

5

and they refused.

8

Mr. Small decided to move to Tucson from Chicago.

The record shows, at pages 205 to 206, that these

was that he decided to come out himself.

9

record he said;

10

At page 206 of the

”1 felt that I could carry the deficit for

some little time.”
There is nothing to indicate that when this

11
12

operating agreement was entered into that Mr. Small had any

13

intention of liquidating the CITIZEN.

54

he tried any steps to improve its financial condition.

15

is nothing to show he made efforts to try to sell it to others.

There is no indication
There

Now, as to the financial condition of the paper, it

IS
17

is true that the CITIZEN for a number of years had been losing

13

money.

19

that Mr. Small came out or during this period, the paper’s

20

condition improved.

Its circulation between those two years

21

went up 22 percent.

Its deficit was reduced.

22

had gone up.

23

However, between 1938 and 1939, just before the time

Its advertising

And its operating revenues had gone up.

The Appellants chide us and say vre have made an

24

unfair comparison, because they say 1938 was the worst year of

25

the CITIZEN and we shouldn’t compare it with 1939.
35

But, of

1

course, it seems not unlikely perhaps that this was the

2

turning point in the CITIZEN»

3

This was the situation that the CITIZEN was faced with when it

4

decided to enter into this operating agreement.

And this was the situation.

In other words, it was at this point that Mr® Small

5
6

when these improvements seemed to be developing that he

7

decided to come out to Tucson to play a more active role in

3

the paper and, as he said, to carry it along for a little

9

while.

10

And, finally — oh, one other thing that I might

11

mention, that there has been reference to the balance sheet,

12

that a substantial portion of these liabilities, as

13

Mr. McLaury has indicated, belongs to stockholders.

14

Finally, as to the present condition, as to the

15

present the claim is a pro forma earning statement, in which,

16

we point out, were some deficiencies.

17

answer to all of this argument, that the CITIZEN was equally

18

certain to fail again if it was now required to terminate

19

these profit-pooling, price-fixing and diversion-of-market

20

provisions of the agreement, is the District Court's three

21

findings at page 98 to 99, Findings No. 190 to 192, which says

22

that the joint printing and distribution of the STAR does not

23

depend upon these provisions, that the restoration of

24

competition requires that they have separate advertising and

25

circulation.
36

But it seems to us the

*}A

Finally, Finding 192 of the Court sayss

E!lt is

2

impossible to predict with any substantial degree of

3

completeness what the operating results of either newspaper

4

will be in a competitive situation a*3
Q

5

What does that mean?

Does that mean that it is

6

impossible to predict whether or not both newspapers may

7

survive?

3

impossible to predict which one of them will die?
A

9

10

Or do you think that the only question is it is

No, I think it is impossible to predict how

well they will do»
Q

11

In other words, you cannot say—

Do you moan that it may be that the District

12

Court contemplated that perhaps both could survive in the

13

market?

14

A

I think so»

The District Court certainly said

15

that he could not make a prediction, that if these provisions

16

were cancelled—

17

Q

At least the Government doesn't agree that in

18

the Tucson market there was only room for one newspaper?

19

only question was which one was going out of business.

20
21

22

A

That is righto

The

We don't acHcee with that,

Mr. Justice.
Therefore, it seems to us that this evidence to

:

23

which I referred — and I will declare one other thing.

It is

24

rather interesting that although the CITIZEN allegedly was

25

failing in 1940 and, presumably, under their theory would have
37

;

1

gone out of business, the STAR was willing to give the

2

CITIZEN a very substantial share of the operating agreement.

3
4

Q

What was the circulation of both newspapers in

1965 as compared with 1940?

5

A

6

Q

Each of them?

7

A

Each of them.

S
9

2©

About 3-1/2 times as much.

They had roughly the same

circulation in 1965, about 40,000 each.
Q

That roughly corresponded with the size of the

community, with the growth in the community?

11

A

X don't know that.

12

Q

That’s all right.

13

A

I don't know that.

14

As I say, although the publisher testified that the

15
'S3

reason he was so generous was that he wanted to preserve two
operating voices in Tucson, it seems that one can

17

legitimately ask whether perhaps he wasn’t also anxious to

18

avoid the possibility that this new man coming in might create

19

a very serious competitor for him or might perhaps sell the

20

paper to someone else who would be in a position to be a more

21

vigorous competitor.

22

So what you have here is that these two people got

23

together and attempted to solve the financial problems of the

24

paper by eliminating all competition between them.

25

We think the District Court was fully justified in
38

*»8

its finding that in 1940 CITIZEN was not on the verge of going

2

out of business and there was not a serious probability at thatj

3

time that CITIZEN would be liquidated and dissolved unless it

4

entered into this agreement.

5

Now, I would like just very briefly **■*» we have

6

developed it in our brief — in my remaining time to say

7

something on the claim if the Court disagrees with us and

3

thinks that this finding is not supported by substantial
evidence»—»

10

Q

Which finding is that?

■A

The finding that they were not a railing

In other words, if the Court were to think that the

13

District Court was clearly erroneous
correct

21

but if the Court should disagree with this, I would

like just briefly to indicate or sketch to the Gousrt the
reasons we think the District Court still properly condemned
these restraints as per se illegal.
The attempt is to analogice this to a partial merger.

Thank you.

A merger basically is a single transaction which has

They still are, I think, Mr. Justice, because

they urge that this is a merger.

10

It seems to me, even

Mr, Justice.

18

in the merger field you have to look at the merger as a whole

19

body.

20

type of thing, we do not think can be analogized to a merger

because we think here you can separate out the good and the

bad and there are very different considerations which are

applicable,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. MAC LAURY, ESQ.

9
10

I think that is right.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MAC LAURY:

If the Court please* we do not ask

11

here for a special rule for newspapers.

«2

where there has been a partial merger or a partial consolida­

13

tion of the assets and the personnel of two firms which

14

preserves to that community compeitifcion which otherwise would

15

fail* that that rule should apply regardless of the business

16

that we are talking about.

We suggest here that

Competition* Mr. Justice* between the news and

Q

What about the competition in seeking

The competition in seeking advertising*

arrangement,, just as there would be under any merger.
We suggest that the owners of STAR and CITIZEN are

2
3

not doing a thing here in this operation that they wouldn't

4

be doing under a complete and total merger,,

5

that they have done is that they have saved this benefit to

12

That is the situation today.

But, Mr, Justice,

13

I would not agree

that it has been suppressed, because in

1940, although these witnesses testified, as laymen, the owners

15

of STAR and CITIZEN, that they intended to eliminate

10

A

There is absolutely no question, Mr, Justice,

that after this agreement there was no competition whatsoever

on the circulation or advertising 3.evel.
I just simply want to add, Mr. Justice, that before

14

1940 there wasn’t effective competition in the antitrust sense

IS

on that level, because the only thing that kept CITIZEN in the

IS

market was not the earnings that it derived from competing with

17

STAR but the monies that were put into that newspaper out of

m

Mr. Small's pocket out of his resources from other areas.

19

20

Q

But that wasn't all of it.

They were getting

some advertising money.

21

They were getting some.

Q

And some circulation money.

They were getting some, but it was not

sufficient to keep that company viable,

to control themselves with reference to that business, that

2

part of the business.

3

A

4

After this operation agreement, that is

correct, Your Honor.

3

Now, I would like to address myself to another point

6

here, and that is Solicitor General's contention here that the

7

Court found that CITIZEN was not a failing company — we submit

8

to the Court that the District Court made no such finding.
•/»

9

Such a finding under the theory on which this case was tried

10

would have been entirely superfluous and irrelevant, because

11

the Court eliminated from this trial any and all Section 1

12

issues., and at the end of the trial. Hr. Justice—

13

Q

Was there a finding on Section 7?

14

There was a finding on Section 7.

to the year 1965.

Section. 7?

It was challenged only under Section 1,

2

was challenged only under Section 1»

3

Q

The 1940 transaction

I knowe but you would have to get by the failing»

4

company — To claim that there was a merger in 1940,, you would

5

have to get by Section 7.

6

A

If they had challenged it under Section 1 v yeSj,

7

but actually the burden on the Government in pleading this

8

case under Section 1 was far greater than it would have been

9

had they challenged it under Section 7.

10

n

They did not challenge

the 1940 operating agreement under Section 7.
So at the close of the trial,, after we had had a

12

great deal of testimony on the question whether there was a

13

violation of Section 2 — and the primary issue there was one

14

of intent to apply a power over the market and to relief.

13

put in a great deal of testimonye including testimony and

10

evidence concerning the failing condition of CITIZENt so as to

17

show that these people really had no intention to monopolize

'18

but that their intent was to rehabilitate these two newspapers»

We

Now,, Section 1 was not in the case at that time.

20

It had been eliminated by summary judgment.

21

of the trial we moved, not quite in terms stated by the

22

Solicitor General„ but our motion was that the Court reopen

23

the trial and sat aside its summary judgment on Section 1 and

24

permit the Government to adduce evidence on that issue and

And at the close

permit us to rebut that evidence and also to apply to that

evidence all of the evidence that we had adduced under

Section 2«

set aside its ruling on summary judgment that Section 1 was

in violation.

context all of the evidence on the failing company doctrine,

Q

So it is not, I think, a proper statement of

Do you think that there was a necessity for the

Court to conclude that in 1965 neither paper was failing in
order to find

11

A

that there was a violation of Section 7?
No, 1 do not, Your Honor,

I think this, that

12

in 1965 the Court needed only to find that if the operating

13

agreement should be abrogated, then one company would-—”

14
15

Q

Yes, but there was a finding of a Section 7

A

Yes, Your Honor,

violation,

IS

The Section 7 violation I

17

haven’t argued here at all.

18

charged was an acquisition by CITIZEN of the stock in STAR

19

in 1965.

The Section 7 violation which was

20

Q

I understand that,

21

A

We do not contest that violation,

22

Q

But neither company was failing at that time,

23

No, neither company was failing

at that time.

We do not contest that rule,
Q

Then if it is taken apart, if the companies were
43

1

separated right now* they wouldn’t be failing companies.
Q

2

No, the companies at the journalistic level --

3

and we have asked this coixrt to reverse the Section 1 issue

4

and permit us to sell, permit CITIZEN to sell STAR promptly, as

5

we had always advised the Government that, in the first place,

6

that was what we intended to do when we acquired it.

has no intent and no desire to retain STAR.

8

intent at the time they acquired it to promptly dispose of it.

12

13
14
15

So we raise no issue there.

13
19

20
21

22

It was tneir

The only issue we raise on the

1965 transaction is that if this court should sustain the
District Court’s ruling on abrogating the main clauses of the
operating agreement, so that CITIZEN then woula be likely to go
into a failing condition, that CITIZEN owners be given the
option of disposing of either STAR or CITIZEN, because the
whole game has been changed.
That is the same option that the Government recently

16
17

CITIZEN

gave in a consent decree to the Gannett Newspapers in
Rockford, Illinois, where the Gannett Newspapers acquired a>
radio.

And in consenting to dispose of one or the other the

Government agreed that the newspapers could have their choice,
to dispose of either the radio station or the newspaper.
In closing I would like to state again that I am

23

satisfied and that on examination the Court will be satisfied

24

that because of the conflict between the findings of fact in

OK

No, 14, Finding 14 and Finding 15 of the financial condition

of CITIZEN that it could not have meant that by Finding 17* by

its conclusion in Finding 17, that CITIZEN in 1940 was not a

failing company.

Mr* Small was willing to continue, at that time to reach down

5

deeper in his pocket to continue to finance that failing
r~
company.

these findings made, after all the evidence was in on the

Section 2——

It

A

Yes, Your Honor, about one year after the

case was tried, nine months afterward*

12

I might add to that that Finding 17 was not proposed

13

by the Government and was not proposed by the defendants.

14

was a finding arrived at by the Court on which it heard no

15

argument.

24

you said.

25

abrogating those provisions to the operating agreement, then

If the Court should sustain the District Court in

51

this would be a new ball game, and there ought to be the

2

opportunity afforded you either to dispose of CITIZEN or

3

dispose of the STAR®

Is that correct?

4

A

That is correct*

5

Q

Now, if we sustain the District Court as to

6

the provisions of the operating agreement., what now precludes

7

your having that option, the divestiture?

8
9
10
11
12

A

Because the District Court's Order orders the

owners of CITIZEN to dispose of STAR and does not give them
that choice, that they must dispose of STAR*
Q

I see.

Then what you are asking is that

CITIZEN be afforded the opportunity to CITIZEN or of STAR?
