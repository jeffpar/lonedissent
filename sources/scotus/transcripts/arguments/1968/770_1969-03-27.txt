ARGUMENT OF KEITH C, MONROE, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. MONROE:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it please the

Court:
The Court considers today a case which, I believe,

9
10

No, 770, Ted Steven Chime1,

goes to the very core of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.
The facts of the case:

1?

In February 1965, there was a

12

burglary of the Pulati home in Santa Ana, California,

13

of coins were taken, some medals and tokens, containers, and so

14

forth.

15
16

Q

A number

This wasn't currency; these were rare coins or

collectors' items.

17

A

Rare coins, collectors9 items, pur Honor; yes.

18

Thereafter, in August of 1965, there was a burglary of

19

a coin shop, the Money Vault.

20

f ornia , ne arby.

21

This took place in Orange, Cali-

Without going into a great deal of detail, there was

22

suspicion of the petitioner as to the Pulati burglary, but I

23

think it was pretty much agreed, and appears in the record that

24

way, that there was no probable cause on which his arrest could

25

have been founded »
2

Q

He was a fellow member of a collectors® club, with

the Puiatis, was he?
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

Q

And he missed a meeting one night, and that was

the night the Puiatis house was burglarised?
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

Also, prior to that

time ha had talked to them about insurance, whether or not the
coins were insured.

He knew, of course, as a fellow member of

coin clubs, that they were coin collectors and that they did
! have coins in their home.
As to the Money Vault burglary, the petitioner made a
statement before the burglary to a neighbor that he had a big
deal cooking that night and that he was going to knock over —
I don't know whether he said "coin shop" exactly; he was going
to knock over a place, anyhow.
Thereafter, to the same neighbor he made a statement
the day following the burglary that an attempt had bean made to
enter, which had been unsuccessful, and some two weeks later he
made another statement to another coin shop operator that he had
been involved in the Money Vault matter.
Now, then, this was about the middle of August.

On

August 25th, the California Supreme Court found that petitioner
was arrested without a warrant, on the street, in Santa Ana,
California, by the investigating officer here, Officer Del Coma.
After transportation to the Orange Police Station and some

i

1

interrogation, petitioner was released.

2

Then on September 13th, something more than two weeks

3

later, Officer Del Coma went to the appropriate magistrate and

4

submitted a complaint in purely conclusionar/ form.

5

plaint is set out in the petitioner's brief.

S

The com­

On the basis of this complaint which, in substance,

7

merely said "I believe that this man committed a burglary on

8

such-and-such a date in this county," on the basis of this com­

9

plaint, a warrant of arrest issued at 10;39 a.m. on September

10

13th.
Officer Del Coma doesn't give us too clear a picture

It
12

of what he did the rest of that day.

13

tioner was at that time.

14

to go and get him.

15

the petitioner's home something shortly after 4;00 p.m., knowing

16

at that time that he was not home.

He knew where he worked.

He knew where

But in any case, Officer Dal Coma arrived at

He gained admittance to the house, waited for him to

17

18

He knew where the peti­

come home —

19

Q

Was somebody else in the house?

20

A

His wife was there, Your Honor*.

21

Q

Does it show how he gained entry into the house?

22

Did he show the wife the arrest warrant, or doesn't the record

23

show?

24
25

A

The record simply shows that the officer requested

admittance to wait for Mr. Chime1, Your Honor.
4

Q
sence,

Well, is that to say that at least

his pre­

the officer's presence is not an unlawful presence in

side the house, based upon the consent of the wife?
A

I think this record is clear enough to show one

way or the other, Your Honor.
(5

We don't contend that the offi­

cer's presence was unlawful at that point.
Mr. Chirnel came home at something like 4;30 p.m. , wherjs

7
8

upon the officer, after he had entered the house, placed him

3

under arrest on the authority of the warrant, showed him the

10

warrant, requested permission to search, which was not granted.

11

The officer then stated that, having executed a lawful arrest on

12

a felony warrant, he had a right to search, and he was going to,

13

and proceeded to do so.
This search covered every room in the house.

14

It

15

covered the garage.

It covered an inspection in the attic and

15

it involved the opening of drawers, the opening of boxes, cup­

17

boards.

*

18

It was described by the officer as a general search.
The officer did not have knowledge, at the time he

19

mads this search, of information which led him to believe that

20

any specific property was to be found in that house.

21

22

23

Q

What is your position, about the arrest?

Was that

a lawful arrest on that warrant?
A

I can't answer this simply yes or no, Your Honor

24

for the reason that in this case wTe raised the issue, so far as

25

I know in California, that the arrest warrant had been unlawfully
5
i

3

issued.

2

Q

Under State law?

3

A

Under Federal law, Giordenallo versus U.S. and

5

Q

The California court so held, didn’t they?

o

A

The California court did so hold, Your Honor.

7

Q

So we now have a ruling of the State courts that

4

8

Aguilar.

this warrant is invalid.

9

A

That is correct.

to

Q

Did they rule that it was invalid under Californi

A

No, Your Honor.

11

law?

12

13

Aguilar, and Barnes9 cases from this Court.
Q

14
15

It was under Giordenello,

I see? the arrest warrant itself, on a probable

cause basis.
A

16

That is correct, Your Honor.

This brings us, thep f

17

to the alternative holding of the California court that it was

18

a valid probable-cause arrest.
If I may leave that point for a moment, it ties in

19

20

with a later part of the argument.
Q

21

22
23
24
25

Well, I suppose it is going to be relevant, isn't

it; what we have to decide is the scope of the search, whether
that arrest was or was not lawful; whether on the basis of the
warrant or on the basis of probable cause in respect to the
warrant?
6

1

A

Yes, Your Honor,

1 am a little bit on the horns

2

of a dilemma in that I don't want to concede the arrest was law­

3

ful, because I have doubts,

4

other reasons.
Q

'3

I think that the search was bad for

I simply don't want to make the concession,
Well, without making a concession, I guess you are

6

going

.o argue on the assumption that it was lawful, nevertheless,

7

in scope, this exceeded the speed limit under the Fourth Amend­

8

ment .

9

A

This is correct, Your Honor.

10

Q

But you are going to argue, aren't you, that there

11

should be no arrest without a warrant at all?

12
13

A

No, Your Honor, I don't intend to make that argu­

Q

You do concede that you may arrest without a war­

ment .

14
15

rant, constitutionally

16

A

17

Q

22
23
24
25

I agree with that.

I just wondered what your

contention was.
Q

20
21

I am sure that there are myriad

cases where, an arrest without warrant should be valid.

18
19

Oh, certainly.

you have said.

I don't understand your position in here, what
I thought that you were arguing to this Court

that the arrest was an unlawful arrest, in these particular cir­
cumstances , and that, second, even if the arrest was lawful,
which you say it was not, the search was of an impermissible
scope.

Nov;, is that your position or is it not?
7

1
2

That is what I thought was indicated by your petition
'

for cert, and by your brief here.
A
self.

My primary focus, Your Honor, is on the search it­

I also take a second position that on the facts of this

case, a valid warrant should have been used.
o
7

However, my primar;

focus is on the search itself.
Q

I understand that, but I am trying to find out,

8

following my brother Brennan’s question to you, whether second­

9

arily, or in whatever order you want to do it, you challenge the

10

lawfulness of the arrest here.

11

A

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.

12

Q

I thought you did, but if you don't, I would cer­

13

tainly like to know.

14

lenge the lawfulness of the arrest here on the theory that, as

15

the California courts held, the warrant was invalid, that without

16

the warrant the arrest here was unlawful and in violation of the

17

F ourth Amendment.

18

A

As I read your papers, you certainly chal­

If I can clarify, Your Honor, to back up and

19

change the facts a little bit, if the officer had simply put the

20

petitioner under arrest at. his horae, and taken him down to the

21

station, had that been all that had gone on, I would not challenge

22

that arrest on probable cause.

23
24
25

Q

And you would not challenge that arrest on the

grounds that he should have obtained a warrant?
A

No.
8

1

Q

Because you say there was — is it your position

2

that whenever the police have probable cause to arrest, regard­

3

less of the time factor or any other circumstances, theydon't

4

have to get a warrant?

5

A

Is that your position?

That is not my position. Your Honor, but so far

6

as the arrest which involves no search, I don’t think that it is

7

fairly before this Court on this record.

8

Q

I don't understand that at all.

9

Q

Well,

you would have a hard time getting

a remedy

10

if that is all you had, as far as this case is concerned.

!1

might have a civil action, or something, but you would have a

12

hard time arguing that an otherwise valid conviction had to fall

13

because the arrest was an improper one.

14

thing like that, have we?

15

21
22
23
24
25

Q

You

We have never held any­

No, but involved in this, as I understand it, one

of the arguments that the State makes is that the search and the
seizure were lawful as incident to a valid arrest.
A

That is

Q

Now, do

correct, Your Honor.
you or do you not arguethat the arrest

was invalid as one branch of your submission to this Court?
A

For the sake of argument, Your Honor, I will con­

cede that this arrest was invalid, for the sake of argument here,
Q

No, no.

I am not asking you to concede anything.

I am trying to find out what your position is.

I have read your

petition and your brief here, and you surprised me by what you
9

i

i said.

If that is your position, then that is your position»

z

A

Pursuing the facts of the case, then, after this

3

|search, or going back tothis search of September 13th, it was

4

based altogether on a charge of burglary of the Money Vault,

5

far as the record shows, the only thing which was missing from

6

the Money Vault was coins, nothing else»

7
8

So

Nevertheless, in this

jsearch, a large quantity of coins and medals, tokens, boxes,
razor blades, containers, various other non-coin items were seiz

9

Q

Were these the fruit of another burglary?

10

A

This was what later developed, Your Honor.

11

Q

Did the police know it at the time?

12

A

NO.

13

Q

They never even knew of the other robbery or burg

A

The record indicates that Officer Del Coma, who

14
15

| lary?

16

is the central figure here, had heard something of the Pulati

17

burglary, the first burglary, but that —
«

18

Q

He didn't know what was stolen there?

19

A

I think he knew there were coins which had been

20
21

22
23
24
25

3d,

taken, but he did not have any detailed information so far as the
record shows.
Q

If he had known what was stolen in the Pulati cast

and he encountered it in the house that he searched, in the courbe
of searching for coins stolen in another burglary, would you say
he couldn't seize the fruit of the Pulati —

10

A
c.

Oh, no»

If, Your Honor, he were in the course of

legal search, I think under Marron he would have a right to

seize contraband or stolen goods which he happened to come across
in the course of a legal search, although I don't think this was
a legal search at all here»
Q

This is your fundamental question, the legality

of the search.
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

Q

Without either a valid arrest warrant or a valid

search warrant.
A

That is correct.

Q

Well, the legality of the search, as I understand

your case, depends upon two issues: First of all, the search, I
suppose you would argue, was obviously invalid if the underlying
arrest was invalid.
A'

That is correct,

'

Q

Because the only justification for the search is

that it was incident to a lawful arrest; therefore, if the arrest
was not lawful, the search could not be lawful, regardless of its
scope.
Your second point is, even if the arrest was a lawful
arrest, this search which is justified only as an incident to a
lawful arrest, was far too wide in scope to be incident to a
lawful arrest.
A

Is that your submission?
That is correct, Your Honor9 plus on additional
11

1

i point:

1 suggest that in order to make a search as an incident

2 i to an arrest, there should he a showing of the same elements of
3

probable cause thereafter which would have justified issuance of

4

a search warrant in the first place, else you are proceeding wit

3

a search which is not justified by as much showing, you are pro­

6

ceeding without a warrant with less showing than you would be ha 3

7

you proceeded with a warrant, the preferred method of procedure.
Q

8

Let's assume a lawful street arrest of somebody

9 ' that you have reasonable cause to believe has a concealed weapon
10

11
12

i

and let’s assume that there is sufficient probable cause and tha
you do stop and arrest that man.

i arrest you can search him.

Then certainly incident to tha£:

You would agree with that?

13

A

No quarrel.

14

Q

And if, instead of a gun, you don't find a gun at

15

all, but what you do find is narcotics on him, right in his

16

pocket, although there v?as never any ground for a search warrant:

17

to search his pockets for narcotics, would you agree or not that

18

that is a perfectly valid search and seizure of the narcotics,

19

even though there was no ground at all to search him for nar­

20

cotics,

21

22
23
24
25

A

Oh, certainly, Your Honor.

Searches, I think,

stand on an altogether different plane, because the officer
arresting a person obviously has a primary need to search that
rian and see that he is not assaulted with some sort of weapon.
2 don’t think there is any question there.
12

There is an obvious

1

necessity.

2

Q

Well,- let's see, then, Mr. Monroe.

This gets

3

down, then

to, except for searches of a person —- except for

4

searches of the person — there has to be both probable cause to

5

arrest, and independent of the arrest, probable cause to search.
A

S

If I may, Your Honor, I wouldn't say really that

7

it is independent of the probable cause to arrest.

8

ing to —-

Rather, turn­

3

Q

Well, in addition to, rather than independent.

10

A

There has to be that other element of some reason

11

to think, if I, as the officer, am going to search the place of

12

arrest, then I have to have some reason to think —
Q

13

Well, all of our cases so far, I gather, have

14

sustained searches, so long as there was probable cause to make

15

the arrest and the search was incident to that arrest, whet rer

16

or not the officers had knowledge of what it was they might pick

17

up.

IS

Would that be so?
A

I think there is a strong suggestion in the cases,

19

Your Honor, the cases which have sustained searches, that this

20

Court, in fact, has over the years sustained those searches

21

which have proceeded in this context with a valid arrest warrant

22

and a very strong suggestion that the officer did have knowledge

23

that "What I want at least has a likelihood of being there."

!

24
25

It becomes almost impossible to explain the exploratory
search cases unless there is something of that nature.
13

: 1

Q

Well, what more do you suggest we need if you havb

2

probable cause, or a warrant to arrest a fellow

3

some coins, and you go to his house and arrest him in his house?

4

Do you suggest you need more reason to search his house for the

5

coins than the fact that you think he stole them?

for stealing

! 6

A

That is correct, Your Honor»

7

Q

You have to have some reason to believe that he

0

has not only stolen them, but that he has actually got them thers?

9

A

That is correct- Your Honor.

10

Q

And you suggest our cases support that submission?

11

A

Yes, Your Honor.

12

Q

Has that question ever been explicitly addressed

13

in any of our opinions?

14

A

No.

15

Q

You get more comfort out of the pre-Harris cases

16

The cases in this Court —

than you do out of the Harris case.
A

The Harris case is not comforting at all, Your

Or Rabinowits.

20

No.

18

21

22
23
124

25

Honor.

Rabinowitz, I think, is squarely an issue, s

far as its language, the warrant is not required.
Q

Really, the essence of your position is that you

want us to re-examine Rabinowitz and Harris, and that is a per­
fectly understandable position.
A

That is correct.
14

1

Q

But that is the guts of your case, isn’t it?

2

A

That is correct,,

Q

You think your re-examination would go so far as

I don’t think it would bs necessary»

Let me

6

clarify my position here, too, because, of course, when one sug­

7

gests a re-examination of Rabinowits, the mind automatically

3

turns to the revival of Trupiano.

19

generally been supported -- it might be noted here, too, that

20

Rabinowits so often cited as a non-warrant case, was a case, in

fact, in which there was a valid arrest warrant and there was

every reason to think the very property for which the search was

made was in the place which was searched.,

The other cases which have supported similar searches,
United States versus Ventresca, Rugendorf, Jones versus the
United States 362 U.S», Abel versus U.S. 362, of course Rabinowits which was with a warrant, U.S. versus Lefkowitz, and Marron
versus U„S.
Q

I take it, then, that you position certainly

| would be that if the officer went to the magistrate and said,

”1

i

; ha/e probable causa to believe that so-and-so stole some coins."
.

and if the magistrate agreed with him that he had probable cause,

j
S

he nevertheless couldn’t automatically also get a search warrant.
You couldn't say to the magistrate,

"Well, you agree

with me that I have probable cause to believe that John Jones
i

stole these coins, and you are giving me the arrest warrant for
! his arrest; therefore, give me a search warrant for his house."
i You would say he would have tohave more than that to get a
j search warrant.
;

i

A

Certainly, Your Honor, because he would have to

:

particularly describe for the magistrate the place to be searche d
and the persons or things to be seized.
I

Q

Well, it describes the house.

A

But the persons or things to be seized.

l

I
i
1

Q

He also says the coins may be there.

Q

He says the coins that were stolen here, the

description of the coins.
A

But I think under Camara he would have to give

16

! some reason for thinking that they were there.
Q

!

Well,, because the man stole them, and that is

.

i where he lives.
A

If this were before a magistrate, and the magis-

trafce passed on it and felt that there was a sufficient showing,,!
li
taking all of the facts in such-and-such -—
[l

Q

Well*- I know, but would you agree there was a

sufficient showing?

If you agreed there was probable cause to

arrest, and you agreed that the arrest warrant, validly issued,
| would you agree there was then probable cause to issue the searon
:

1'

warrant to search his house where he lived?
A

Cause shown is merely enough to arrest, if that

is the cause shown, I do not think that is enough to search his
house.
■

Q

What more must he show?

A

Some reason for thinking that

Q

That he stashed the coins there instead of some­

place else „
A

That is correct, Your Honor.
j

Q

Well, suppose the officer says, "I would assume

that he has them in his home."
A

If the officer assumed that they were in his

I

I possession?
Q
am sura.

If he told the magistrate that.

He did rob this place.

17

Of one thing I

I am certain of that, and I

assume that the coins will be in his home,
A

Let me turn to the facts in the case —

Q

Isn’t it your position that he has to do more

than assume that they are there?

Isn't that what your position

is?
A

Oh, certainly»

There has to be something other

than an unfounded assumption,
Q

That the coins are there? like somebody saw him

put them there.

Going back to the second point, how far, when he

is arrested, do you go beyond search of a person?
A

The room?

I think there can be no question, Your Honor,

about the validity -- let me separate, first of all, searches
and seizures.

Many of the cases treat them as one and the same,

I think there can be no question about seizure of evidence,
instrumentalities, contraband, in plain view. Searches of the
person, of course, are conceded.
As far as searches beyond that, it is very, very hard,

You would draw one line in fcha attic?

You would

draw the other line at his person,, and then you wouldn't try to

4

draw a line anyplace else.

5

You would say certainly he couldn't search the attic.

6

A

I think, Your Honor, that the only logical line

7

that can be drawn is the person, and those things which are in

plain view of the person at the place of arrest. When it involves

going into the containers, so to speak, then I think the legiti-

What happens if he arrests him, takes him down,

Just for the fun of it.

A

I questioned him on that and he didn’t so testify

7

Q

Isn’t, this case 3omewhafc confusing because there

8

were two burglaries involving coins, and the police officer went

9

there with probable cause to arrest for one of them.

10

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

11

Q

He had no knowledge of the other one, and he made

12

a general search of the whole house, and found nothing in con-

13

naction with the burglary on which they had probable cause, but

14

found some things on the other burglary for which they had no

15

probable cause when they went there, and had no information.
A

16

That is true, Your Honor.

This is a hard point

17

here, and I think it bears emphasis that the case on which they

18

had probable cause was coins, and coins alone, so far as the

19

record shows, and the seizure was of medals, tokens, boxes,

20

wallets, razor blades, things which weren't even in the same

21

class.

Q

This is something like the facts in Mapp, where

they went looking, I think, for gambling apparatus, or something
of that kind, and they made a general search and ended up finding
some obscene literature in a trunk in the place.

20

That would be

somewhat comparable to this, wouldn't it?
A

It is, Your Honor? yes.

I see that my time has expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Monroe, we have taken

all your time by asking questions, arid I think we would like to
hear something about Rabinowitz and Harris, because that is the
thrust of your case, and I suggest that you may have five
minutes for rebuttal, if you want, after hearing from the other
side.
MR. MONROE;

And, of course, you may have five

minutes extra if you wish it, too, Mr. George:.
ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. GEORGE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GEORGE;

The issues in this case basically are

was the search, which was an incident of the concededly valid
arrest on probable cause, rendered unreasonable solely by virtue
of the fact that it extended beyond the room in which petitioner
was arrest.
Secondly, was it rendered unreasonable by virtue of
the fact that there was a delay of some six hours in executing
the warrant of arrest.
Third, was it rendered unreasonable; solely by virtue of
the fact that it was conducted as an incident to an arrest on
probable cause, instead of by way of a search warrant.
Q

In what way did the California court hold that
21

1

the warrant was invalid?

2

A

i

The California Supreme Court, in this case and in

3

the companion case of People versus Sesslin, held that the pro-

4

eedure which had been followed in the State of California for

5

rany, many years, of issuing warrants upon complaints which did

6

| not set out the factual elements of probable cause, were invalid,

|
7

| but the court held that, although this arrest warrant was invalid,-

8 i there was ample probable cause —
Q

9

I understand that.

Well, what about the second

iO ! point chat you listed there?

Why do we have to consider that,

it
12

Is that involved

■ in this case?
I

A

13

That has been raised by the petitioner.

We con-

14 I sider it a purely frivolous point that is hardly an unreasonable
15
16
17

delay.

But petitioner contends that the execution of the arrest

; was deliberately delayed so as to permit the officers to search
the house,
Q

18

You mean, assuming that the warrant was otherwise

19

valid, petitioner argues that its effect was spent, or it was

20

invalid or ineffective because of the delay.
A

21

Yes.

Is that the point?

But the State Supreme Court specifically

22

upheld the arrest on the theory of probable cause apart from the

23

warrant.

24

there was more probable cause for arrest.

25

I would submit that one could not find a case in which

A

No, they did note

They went to the house,

4 ; found he wasn't there, wanted to arrest him, and they waited for
him.

5

6

A

They waited approximately 10 minutes,

7

Q

They arrested him, and then the search followed

that, is that it?

3
9

A

That is correct.

10

Q

I take it that your point is that the arrest was

valid because there was probable cause, and that no warrant was

11
12

necessary.
I

13

A

That is correct.

The officer —

14

Q

Is there any case that you can think of in which

15

a warrant is necessary and can be lawfully obtained consistent

16

v?ith the Fourth Amendment?

17
18

really read out of existence — read out of existence —■ the
need for a warrant?
A

19

22
23
24
25

No, it does not.

First of all, may I ask Your Honor for a clarification

20
21

In other words, doesn't this positio >

Are you speaking of warrants for arrest when you speak of search
warrants?
A

Let's take the arrest warrant.

First, is there

any case where an arrest warrant could be obtained under the
Fourth Amendment and would be necessary on the theory in which

23

1

this case is being argued by you,, and I expect by your adversary?

2

A

Our position is no.

3

Q

In other words, police never need a warrant,

If

4

they have probable cause, they can get a warrant, of course, for

5

purposes of the Fourth Amendment; but they don't need it, becaus

6

if they have probable cause, they can go ahead and arrest.

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

So all this business of going to a magistrate in

9

terms of the warrant is wasted time.
A

10

I don’t think it is wasted time, and the officer

11

here certainly didn’t think it was wasted time.

12

expressly that it was his habit that whenever possible

1 know.

He testified

Well, maybe it is a nice thing for offi­

cers to do, but no legal requirement.

15

A

That is correct.

Trupiano said that.

16

Q

Second, turning to the search warrant,, your posi­

17

tion is exactly the same, isn’t it; that is to say, wherever the ce

18

is probable cause to search, there is no need to obtain the war­

19

rant .

20

A

No.

21

Q

On the other hand, if there is not probable cause

22

t

the warrant cannot be obtained.

23

Q

You don’t say that, do you?

24

A

That is not our position, because clearly a searc 1

25

may not be made upon probable cause.
24

A search may be made only

1

as an incident to an arrest upon probable cause, and we would

2

submit that whenever there is a proper arrest, and that the

3

search is (1) reasonable; and (2) incident to the arrest, that

4

then there is no need to obtain a search warrant,
Q

S

6

Can you suggest a situation to me in which there

is probable cause for arrest and not probable cause to search?
A

7

Yes,

One situation which comes readily to mind

8

is the arrest of a person — let’s say Mr. Chimel was arrested

9

at a friend’s house.

Now, there would be thu right to search

10

incident to arrest, but perhaps not the same type of search as

11

you have h€*.re, because it would not be predictable that the

12

stolen coins would be at this friend's house, or a public place.
Q

13

What you are really saying is that there may be

14

a difference in the permissible scope of the search, but that,

15

whenever there is probable cause to arrest, there is probable

16

cause to conduct some sort of search.

17

ing?

Is that what you are say­

18

A

Yes, that is our position.

19

Q

How far could they go in the searching in the

20
21

22
23
24
25

j

hypothetical that you just gave?
A

That might depend upon who this friend was, whether

he had some connection with the burglary or not.

Now, under cur­

rent law, there doesn’t seem to be any definite limitation.

This

Court has always said that we must view the legality of the par­
ticular search in light of its reasonableness and the facts of
25

1

the case, and there can’t be any mechanical standards here.

2

I think what is significant is that the Fourth Amend­

3

ment p as it was drawn up by the framers, does not confer a nar­

4

row grant of the power to search.

5

power to search, the existing and recognized power to search, an 3

6

prohibits only searches that are unreasonable.

7

determination of reasonableness is a vary practical concept and

8

it has been since it evolved under the common law.

Q

They were looking for the coins from this robbery.

A

That is correct.

Q

Which they didn't find.

A

Ho, that is not the case.

The only — and I wish

to correct prior statement on that that was made in the precedin j
argument.
The record shows that no coins were positively identi­
fied as coming from that burglary, but that is not to say that
there were no coins seized.

The inference is very strong that

many of the coins were from the Money Vault burglary.

We have

set out an inventory of the coins seized in our brief as an ap­
pendix, and if y6u compare those items to some of the items
seized from Mr, Slocum's store during the burglary, there is a
great similarity.

But we know that coins are, by their very

nature, almost fungible items, with a few exceptions, and it is
very difficult to say "That is my nickel."
Q

Mr. George, put it this way:

what they were looking for — coins.
A

Yes.
29

They knew exactly

1

2

Q

And they seised items other than coins, which

they did not know at that time were stolen.

A

Mo, that is not the case,

Q

Did they know about this other robbery before

15

petitioner.

16

Q

17
18

Money Vault?
A
that.

23
24
25

Is that your argument?
Exactly.

I would like to clarify the record on

There was some confusion.
The items seized consisted of coins, coin paraphernal! a F

21

22

You suggest that everything he seised at that

time was the kind of thing that might have been stolen from the

19

20

He was looking for one thing only, and that was evidence,

a.nd one item that does not fall into that category — a quantity
of razor blades, and why razor blades?
that.

The officer was asked

Well, because petitioner had said at the time of the

arrest, "These razor blades are part of a coin transaction.”
30

Now, that is susceptible of the inference that they
could have been part of the Money Vault

burglary transaction,

but there is nothing that is not reasonably apparent as to be
part of the Money Vault burglary that was seized.

It was a very

limited search that was confined by the objective of the officer
which was a permissible objective, namely, to return the stolen
property.

This was three-fourths of the man's inventory that

had been wiped out, and the officers merely wanted to return
that property to their rightful owner, and their search was 45
minutes and was confined to that.
Now, petitioner has implied that this was a wholesale
ransacking of the house.

This isn't true.

The record indicates

unequivocally, and we have set it out in detail in our brief,
that there were only two rooms that were really searched in the
sense of what a search is, prying into hidden places,
Q

Which rooms were they?

A

They were a bedroom, and a second bedroom —

Q

How large a house was this?

A

This was a 3-bedroom tract home,

Q

Tract?

A

Tract-size home.

What kind of a tract?
That is how it was described in

the record.
Q

That is a new word to me,

A suburban house.

These two rooms were searched

in the sense of drawers being opened and petitioner's wife being

an innocuous explanation for any coins, and the officers left

Q

10

Mr. George, may I ask you this:

Is your desire t

11

broaden out the right of search?

Does that indicate a desire

12

on the part of law enforcement in California to wipe out the

13

necessity of warrants, search warrants, warrants of every kind,

14 | in order to go in and search whenever they want to do so?
15

A

NO,

16

Q

I will tell you the reason I ask that.

It is be­

17

cause in one case we had here a while back, it was stated to us

18

that in the great City of Los Angeles, the Police Department got;

!9

out, I think it was, fewer than 20 search warrants in an entire

20

year.

21

22
23
24
25

A

That is incorrect information.

Q

How widespread is the practice of getting search

warrants in Los Angeles?
A

I will indicate that,

I want to preface that by

stating that the California Supreme Court, in its Keener decisio

32

1

V, lic.h we have cited, has evidenced a policy encouraging the use

2

c.c warrants.

the California Peace Officers Bulletin encouraging officers to

use search warrants, an article by the District Attorney.

Q

How prevalent are they, let's say, in the City

of Los Angeles?
A

7

The figures we have for the Central District of

8

Ess Angeles, and some of the neighboring judicial districts —

3

this is not the whole county -— is 225 search warrants issued

!0

last. year.

11

Q

But that includes territory outside of Los Angele ;

12

A

Out of the city, certain parts? yes.

13

It is not

county-wide.
Q

The Los Angeles Police have nothing to do with

16

A

That is correct.

17

Q

How many in the City of Los Angeles?

18

A

The City of Los Angeles, I would say approximately

14

15

those.

19

200, I would think.

Most of those in the Los Angeles Judicial

20

District are in the City of Lcs Angeles.

21

Q

Most of them, you say,,

22

A

Yes.

Now; this is a thirteenfold increase since

rule to be followed in California.

As Mr, Justice Harlan pointed out in his dissent to

2

the Chapman case, California has been in the forefront of all the

States in laying down rules protecting the rights of criminal

suspects, both in the field of confessions and search and seizure.

12

They got coins, coin paraphernalia, and this one

j item of a fev; razor blades.
Q

13
14

What did they get in the house?

Was that identified by anybody as belonging to the

place that had been burglarised?
A

15

There were two burglaries, of course.

Some of

16

the coins were definitely identified as coming from a second

17

burglary because they were unusual coins.

IS

We have set them forth.

19

something like this, that the Pulatis recognized immediately, or

They were odd metals.

Things like Alaska Centennial coins, or

20

else a container of coins with Mr. Pulati's handwriting crossed

21

out.
So, of course, those were able to be identified, but

22

23

they were 35 coins out of this quantity, a large quantity, of

24

coins.

25

The other coins, there was a very strong inference that,

they were one and the same from the burglary for which the
34

officers had made the arrest.

Q

Did. the defendant testify?

A

The defendant did testify.

Ha gave an explanation

that was so inherently improbable of his guilt that we would
submit that it afforded a consciousness of guilt evidence of his
guilt.

It was a highly unlikely explanation.

I

Q

What did you say?

He testified?

A

He testified in his own behalf and gave such a

contrived explanation of how he had coma into possession of some
of these coins —
Q

Did he admit he had come into possession of them?

A

Yes,, he did; and he said that he had purchased

1 them from a man, and ha didn’t know whom, and he didn't collect
I medals , but he had bought these medals anyway, and it was a very
obvious attempt

to fabricate an explanation for them. In fact,

he changed his testimony with reference to cne coin, that he
didn't know how
I remembered that

he had obtained that, but later on he suddenly
he had bought it.

He gave no satisfactory ex­

planation.
Q

Then the testimony that he was in possession of

! them is without dispute?
A

That is true; yes.

In fact, there was a stipu-

j .... ation between Mr. Monroe and the District Attorney who tried
j the case that the coins identified by the Pulatis, found on the
premises, were the same coins that were at the Pulatis9 home on
35

1

the night of their burglary.

That is in the record.

2

Q

Mr. George, was he tried for both burglaries?

3

A

He was, and was convicted of both.

4

Q

He was convicted of both.

5

A

Yes, he was.

S

Q

Although there was no identification of the coins

7
3
9

from the second or the burglary on which they had had probable
! cause?
A

Well, no.

There were no coins found at petition­

10

er's house that were tied into that burglary positively, but

11

there was another coin, a very unusual coin with four faulty

12

markings, that two months, 1 believe, after the search, petition

13

er sold to a coin dealer, and this was a coin from the Money

14

Vault burglary.

37

And.

Mow,, what can be unreasonable in this search?
tainly not the scope.

Cer­

The scope was certainly proper.

The

objective of returning the stolen coins to their owner would not
be served by arbitrarily saying,

"Well, you can search this

room, but not that one? this cupboard,, not that one."

If we

started setting down standards like that, the police and the
courts would certainly be confused.
What size of a room could you search?

What, circum­

ference around the defendant?
We submit that the Rabinowitz standard of reasonable­
ness under all the circumstances is the proper standard, especie,; ..
in the light of the fact that we have a State conviction here.
Under our Federal system, and under the decision in Ker, the
States may develop workable rules of search and seizure.

That

is what California has done.
Q

What is your submission as to why an officer,

when he arrests someone in his house, should be able to search
any more broadly than the person of the defendant, to search for
weapons or something like that, to guarantee the officer's own
safety, or to just seise what is in plain sight?

What is your

basis cor saying that he should be able to search for the fruits
of a crime?
A

Well, our legal, basis is, first of all, the

Agnello decision.

A

cal limitations.

You should

be able to search for the fruits of the crime anywhere in the
locality where you arrest the defendant?
A

Depending on the facts of the case.

Let * s say

we have a television set involved here.
Q

Well, why should you be able to search for the

fruits of the crime, though, without a warrant?
A

Because the objective of returning them to their

owner is certainly a legitimate —

Well, you can get a'warrant and do that.

A

All right.

You know what the fruits of the crime are.

In this case, we submit —
Why

don't you come armed with a warrant for a search?
A

It is easy to speak in terms of one case and say

"Well, the officer could have taken the two or three hours to
obtain a search warrant," and that is what Commentator states
it takes under ideal conditions to obtain one.

But if you mul­

tiply this across the country, the last year for which there
were statistics, there were 1,600,000 burglaries committed in
tie United States alone.

Did you have probable cause to get a search war­

A

Yes.

Q

A very simple question:

rant?

When the officer went to

get the arrest warrant, why didn't he also ask for a search war­
rant, because you have already admitted that one of his purposes

41

was to retrieve this money,
A

Yes.

Q

Welly why didn't he write this other piece of

A

Exactly,

paper?
It is so simple that one wonders why

not, with an officer who is as eager to protect the defendant's
constitutional rights.
That answer is, under this Court's decisions, specific
ally Matron and Stanford versus Texas, there is a very stringent
requirement of particular description.

It would not have been

enough for the officer to describe the property to be seized as
coins and coin paraphernalia stolen from the Money Vault,"
Q

I thought you said you had enough to get one,

A

Yes,but what would the officere have had to do

to get one?

He would have had to describe these coins in great

detail,
Q
Q

There you are.
But what you are saying there is the officer has

more latitude, lawfully has more latitude if he does not get a
warrant than if ha does get a warrant.
A

No, we are not, because the officer could have

obtained a search warrant.

It. might, have taken him two weeks to

co it because ha would have had to distinguish the stolen coins
from the coins that 'would be found on the premises.

But realistically, though, do you think officers

under our cases would get a search warrant when our cases appear
to hold that if you make a valid arrest on probable cause, you
may search incident to an arrest?

Officers don’t ordinarily corns

armed with -- let’s assume for the moment that it would have been
very easy, very easy, to get the search warrant, automatic, five
minutes„
A

Yes.

Q

Officers don't ordinarily coma armed with both

search and arrest warrants, do they?
A

'They do sometimes, and the reason --

0

I said ordinarily.

A

It varies according to jurisdiction,,

Do they?
1 wouldn’ t

say ordinarily across the country, no? but 1 think that there
are incentives to obtain a search warrant that will make officers
cat them at times, and I would like to mention some of those to
the Court»
There is a presumption of legality that attends a
saarch effected by a search warrant.

In many jurisdictions, and

in California, if the officer does not have a search warrant,
the search is presumed to be illegal in California, and the bur­
den is on the prosecution to obtain a search warrant, a justi­
fication for the search.

It must show that there was probable

cause and that the search was incidant to an arrest.
Secondly, the fact that there was a search warrant
43

will insulate the officer from civil and criminal liability that
will not be the case if there is not a search warrant.
Finally, or rather additionally,

there is also an

opportunity for a broader search if there is a search warrant.
The officer will be able to search outbuildings and throughout
•the premises and take as long as he wants if he has a search war­
rant.

There will also be the possibility of search in the ab­

sence of the suspect.
If he doesn’t arrest the suspect at the house, of
I

course, he couldn't search incident to an arrest.

So this way,

with a search warrant, he can search the house in the absence
of the defendant.

If there are multiple suspects, as there often

are in narcotics raids or other conspiracy crimes, let's say, he
can search many places.

The police force can simultaneously,

even if one or more defendants are absent.
Q

Well, now, without the arrest, this search could

not have been made.

You agree with that,

A

That, is correct.

Q

Without a warrant, that

A

Without the* arrest.

Q.

What difference, then,would the State suggest

is.

It makes in terms of the permissibility of this search?
difference does it make that the arrest took place?

What

I know you

can say, "Well, the cases hold that,” but those cases are under
attack here.

I just wonder why you think the arrest, just the

44

fact of arresting a man in his house, gives the officers the
right to make a search of the bedroom that otherwise they would
not have had in the absence of arrest?
A

'Because the officer had sufficient information to

make the most basic invasion of the defendant's privacy that one
can imagine, the seizure of his body.

Now, how much more of an

invasion of privacy is it for the officer to also seize items
around the defendant?
Q

Well, I know, but if you had arrested him down at

h.is office and made that basic invasion of privacy, it would be
very difficult to go and search the house without a warrant,
A

True, but you could have searched his office,

Q

I know, but you couldn't go and search his house.

A

Yes, but there is nothing to indicate that it was

maneuvered.
Q

What difference does it make whether you arrest

him in his house or in his office as to whether or not you can
search his house without a warrant?
A

Well, there are various justifications.

Q

You wouldn't look in a bedroom drawer for a tele™

vision set.
A

Correct.

Q

But you think they could have looked anywhere in

the house that coins might: have been hidden®
A

Yes,where coins could have been hidden and, of

Q

I am surprised that you don't suggest that once

course,

you arrest a man in his house, confederates, family, and everyone
else is alerted and that it might be essential, if the officers
have probable causa, to make the arrest, and probable cause to
believe that he has the fruits, or that they are somewhere, that
there is some kind of urgency about looking for them, for the
fruits, before they are made off with.
A

Well, of course, that would support the officer's

not having to leave and come back with a warrant later.
Q

But it doesn't get to why they didn't get a war-

rant in the first place„ does it?
A

Well, what it doss is, the practical burden that

would have been imposed on this officer to describe thousands
of coins with sufficient particularity, as would be required
under this Court's decision, to distinguish them from the defen­
dant's coins ~
46

Q

In what decision do you say we said that?

A

Marron,

Did we go that far?

A

Marron describes the —

5

Q

Your submission is that to get a warranty it is

6
7

necessary to specify every coin, hundreds of coins?
A

At least to the degree necessary to distinguish

8

then from the defendant’s own coins, which the officers knew

9

would be on the premises, and because there is authority, and we

0

have cited it in our brief, that the description must be adequate

it

to segregate lawful property, the defendant’s own property, from

■'2

the items to be seized.

'3

That is why the officer did not get a search warrant.

14

Very frankly, off the record, I asked the officer, "Why didn’t

!5

you," as Justice Marshall asked, "if you were down there and you

56

executed this affidavit for the arrest warrant, why didn't you

57

also get a search warrant?" and that is it.

He would have had to write down the description

that the victim told him, "Well, this is ray coin because it is
this age, and maybe it is marked up this way, and therefore I
know this nickel from somebody else's nickel»"

He had that information.

It was just a question

of putting it on paper.

That would have been quite a difficult problem.

The officer chose to

Q

Could there also be the possibility that once ha

puts it down on paper, he would be restricted to that and ha
wouldn't be able to pick up something else?

Would that be a

problem?
A

That didn't trouble him, because he left coins

on the premises.
Q

He left many, many coins.

There simply is no reason why he shouldn't have

gotten a search warrant, is there?

Oh,

there definitely is.

It would have been an

Yo u

might not have time to do it between now and 12:00, about a
minute and a half.
You said many times that they had probable cause to
believe he was guilty and that justified an arrest.
A

Yes,,

Q

Could you state briefly what evidence there was

that they had?
A

Yes,

The defendant, prior to the burglary itself,

had approached the victim and said, "How would you like to have
your place knocked off,53 and “Do you carry insurance," and all
of that.

Shortly before the burglary, just a few hours,

told a friend, 5SI have a big job going.

We are going to knock

off a coin shop, maybe $50,000 or $60,000 are involved."
Q

Is this a pawn shop?

A

A coin shop.

Then shortly afterwards, he told

the same friend, "Well, we broke through the two walls and we
came across the wires, but we didn't really go through with the
job completely."
51

Then the next day he told the fellow, "Oh, well I was
just kidding.

Don't believe what I said,"

Then he told another person after the burglary, "I am
involved in the Money Vault burglary.

I may be going to jail on

that."
Then he negotiated with the police for the return of
tie coins,

This man broadcast all over town that he-~
Q

He negotiated for the return of the coins?

A

For the return of the coins? yes.

Q

How do you mean "negotiate" ?

the

the return of the coins for a civil release.
Q

Actually negotiated at the police station,

He did not admit to any burglarizing.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

7

MR. GEORGE:

3

One point that I wanted to make in concluding was that

9

Thank you very much.

the issue here under the Rabinowitz test is not really whether or

10

not it is the police officer or the magistrate who is to make

11

the decision to arrest and search; but rather, whether it is

12

the magistrate who will decide it before the search or the magis1-

13

trate after the search, because, of course, as this Court has

14

noted, it is the exclusionary rule which is the most effective

15

means of deterring unreasonable search and seizure.
As we have attempted to point out in our brief, Cali­

16

17

fornia affords many, many opportunities at all stages of the

18

proceedings to invoke the exclusionary rule and that means has

19

certainly been effective., if not more effective, than the some­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEITCH C. MONROE, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19

But

MR. MONROE:

To pursue this same point

a little bit

20

on the matter of warrants, I had shortly before coming here

21

contacted the clerk of the Municipal Court in the Los Angeles

22

Judicial District, who is one of the few agencies in California,

23

or anywhere, so far as I can find out, who has some statistical j

24

25

information available on search warrants.
To give you an idea of what Los Angeles Judicial District
54

comprises, the entire County is authorised 125 Municipal Court
Judges»

The Los Angeles Judicial District, which is within that

county, comprises 58 of those 125 Judges»

So we have something

here which is approaching half of the entire county»
In 1931, according to the letters I have, the Clerk
of this court commenced keeping separate records of searcn war­
rants issued and papers received for search warrants»
numbered serially, commencing with the Number 1»

They were

As of March

12, 1969, these numbers had reached 1938 or, in other words,
during this period of time, there had been approximately some
50 warrants per year, or something like that, although this is
not a fair representation, since in 1968, according to advice
I have personally received from the Clerk, there were papers
processed in this Judicial District for 179 search warrants»
So the figure has gone up, but it was to me amazingly
low for a 38-year period,
Q

Will you submit that to us, too, please, Mr,

A

Yes, I will.

Monroe?
The 1968 figures I obtained myself.

The letter covers the rest,
Q

Do you have any idea of the comparable figures

in other States?
A

I do not, Your Honor,

Q

Or the comparable figures in the Federal system

itself?
55

A

I do not. know.

Turning to Rabinowifcss „ I think it is necessary to look
to the Fourth Amendment itself,

I think we can see rather

clearly two distinct philosophies in interpretation of the amend­
ment.
Rabinowits and Harris? and that line of cases? say not
I in so many words, but in terms of results they say, the Fourth
Amendment consists of two clauses, one which prohibits unreason­
able searches, and the other clause sets forth the procedure
for obtaining warrants.
The opposing line of cases is, of course, Trupiano,
Taylor versus U.S., and those similar cases which say this is
not true? rather, there is a general requirement in the amendment
which points to the use of warrants and, with or without a war­
rant, any search which is unreasonable does not comply with the
amendment itself.
The question which troubles me greatly in the Rafoinowita-Harris philosophy is that if the unreasonable search clause
can stand by itself, and if there is not some requirement some­
where for the use of warrants as a general rule, but if unreason­
able searches covers the ground, then we have violated a cardinal
principle of statutory construction, because the unreasonable
search clause really covers the substance of what is in the
warrant clause.

It is not necessary to have the warrant language

there.
56

On that basis, I submit that there must be something
more to the amendment which suggests that under some conditions
a warrant is required.
The facts in this case, I think, illustrate with the
search of a home, with very ample time, in fact conceded no
exigent circumstances, where a question about cause for searchin 3
: if this case doesn't require a search warrant, I ask what case
possibly could, and if there is not a case that possibly could
| require a warrant, then the Fourth Amendment itself is changed.
Q

Well, of course, the development in this -whole

field, like so many areas, hasn't been strictly logical.

If you!

take the first philosophy, or what you call the Harris philosophy
through to its logical conclusion, and say that all the Fourth
Amendment requires is reasonableness under the circumstances,
1 would suppose, as a matter of logic, it would follow that if
a policeman gets a warrant for the arrest of a man at his house,
and then finds he doesn't happen to be there, and he gets law­
ful access to the house because of his warrant, it would be very
difficult to see why logically he wouldn't be reasonable.

That

is the only test, for him to go ahead and search the house any­
way .
This whole train of development hasn't been a matter
of pure logic by any manner or means, has it?
A

Along that line of thought, Your Honor, that,

then, would cast doubt on Chapman.

57

It would cast doubt on

Taylor»

It would cast doubt on all of the cases where there

Las been a search and not even an arrest.

They canst all bs

wrong, can they?
Q

1 am not suggesting that is so,

1 am suggesting

that the law, if it remains perfectly stable, that you can't
search without a warrant except in very limited circumstances,
one of which is incident to an arrest and, therefore, it is rot
quite accurate to say that there are two opposite philosophies
as regards the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment as a whole.
namely, reasonable or, logically, a warrant in every case where
you can get one feasibly,
A

My purpose in addressing myself to this, Your

honor, was that if the reasonable clause is to be given primary
meaning, then there doesn’t seem to be any real, strong reason
for having the warrant clause in the amendment at all, for cer­
tainly a v/arrant which was issued without oath or affirmation,
or without probable cause, would not, on its face, be reasonable,
/

Q

Well, we have both parts of the amendment,

A

I think the amendment must be read as a, whole,

Your Honor,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Monroe, before you take

your seat, I just want to say that the Court is conscious of the
fact that you are here in the public interest by assignment of
this Court to represent this indigent defendant.
The Court is greatly comforted by the fact that lawyer 3
58

are willing to do that.

We consider it a real public service

for a lawyer to come to Washington and perform such a service.
We thank you for what you have done, sir.
MR. MONROE;

The pleasure and opportunity has been

mine.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

I want to say to you,, Mr.

Georges that, of course, we are also as interested in the fair
representation of a state as we are in the interest of the
petitioner and we appreciate your frank and earnest interest in
the State of California.
MR. GEORGE;

We thank you, as well.

Thank you.

(Whereupon, at 12;43 p.m. the argument in the ah ov e'­
en titled matter was concluded.)
