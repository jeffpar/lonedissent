ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN E. SMITH., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF' OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

7
8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This is an. appeal from the Fifth Circuit by a young

10

black Selective Service registrant from a conviction in the

11

Eastern District of Louisiana for refusal to be inducted.

12

I might say for the benefit of the Court that this

13

particular registrant went all the way through the system up to

14

the point of where he was asked to be inducted, and he said that

15

he was not going to be inducted.

16

He was then charged by indictment and, of course,

17

tried for this offense in Federal Court and was convicted.

18

thing that happened was that his defense for the criminal charge

19

was that black people had been excluded from his Selective Serv­

20

ice Board, and in the midst of the trial of the case below, we

21

discovered that the Chairman of this black person's board was

22

the President of the United Ku Klux KXans of America, a man

23

named Jack Helm.

24
25

The

At the same time, we found out in the process of try­
ing the case that the defendant had been denied an appeal by
2

!

his board when he tried to tell them that he had a hardship

2

deferment.

3

support of themselves and six brothers and sisters.

4

It turned out that he and his mother were the sole

When the Fifth Circuit decided this case, it said that

S

the defenses were foreclosed because he had failed to exhaust

6

his administrative remedias below.

?

But I say to you that that can't possibly be, because

8

the boards below., the board in Louisiana. Board Ho. 42. was per­

9

fectly incompetent to determine whether or not it was proparly

to

composed, whether its Beard Chairman should have been the Chair­

11

man. or whether the Board should have been dissolved because of

12

the fact that Negroes were excluded from service on the Board.
’■ - [

13

These are constitutional issues which the Board has
j

14

no jurisdiction over, and which could not be raised before the

15

Board and would have to be necessarily raised before the court.

16
17

If we follow Judge Thornberry5s opinion in the Circuit,
it would necessarily mean that these serious constitutional

18

issues could never be raised because we know they can’t be raise'!

19

before the Board.

The Government, in its brief here, agrees with

20

us on that point.

They cannot, then, under the Thornberry

21

opinion, out of the Circuit, be raised in the Federal Court.

22
23
24
25

know that that is impossible.

We

If we cannot raise it in Federal

Court, it simply means that this defendant would then go to jail
for five years, in this case, without ever having been able to
raise these serious constitutional questions in any court, of

3

1

competent jurisdiction»

2

1 think Mr. Justice Murphy, when he wrote the concur­

3

ring opinion in Estep, put it very well»

4

some point, these remedies are not available, then what is going

.5

to happen is that these people are going to — it violates due

process»

7

8

and this was Estep — "in these cases would require adherence to

9

the proposition that a parson may be criminally punished without

10

ever being afforded the opportunity to prove that the prosectuioa

11

is based on an invalid administrative order.

12

most elementary and fundamental concepts of due process of law."

That violates the

Actually, I think what we are trying to do is raise

13
14

a constitutional issue, the fact that Negroes ware excluded from

15

the Board? that the Chairman was a Klansman? that he was denied

16

an appeal.

17
IB-

The fact that these facts were not raised in the Board
below, in the Draft Board, is absolutely irrelevant.

They would

19

not have anything to do with this classification.

20

waived a right that related to classification and we were up here

2!

talking about classification, that would be one thing.

22

If he had

But we are not talking about this man's classification

23

We are talking about his constitutional rights; talking about

24

the composition of that Draft Board.

25

What would be the effect, I ask the Court, of saying

4

1

to this particular defendant, ’’You can never raise those issues

2

in the Board, and you can never raise those issues in this Court 7

3

What would be the effect on the Selective Service System, because

4

the Selective Service System itself is based upon the fairness

5

of the system, and presumably upon the knowledge by the country

(6

that the system operates in a fair manner? that it reflects the

7

qualities of life in America; that it reflects the characteris­

8

tics of the community where the people live who have to serve?

9

that they are drafted by their friends and neighbors»

to

Here we find draft boards — and we all know it in

11

Louisiana ■— where not one Negro had ever served7 and they had

12

an open Klansman on the Board and they knew it, but they didn't

13

do anything about it until after this case, when they got rid of

14

him»

15

But the confidence of the country wouid be shaken in

16

these boards if we can't raise these issues»

17

required to do it»

18

opinion in this regard has got to be overruled»

19

the system can survive, knotting, where the country knows, that

20

it is an illegal system, that it operates in open violation of

21

the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment»

22

I say that we are

We can’t be foreclosed to do it.

I can’t see how

What does the Government say in defense of this?

23

say, “Well, this is like a malapportioned legislature»

24

But actually what they are saying, and it would violate
5

1

the separation of powers if we caraa in and tried to reform the

2

system this way, or raise this question»

3

question raised before this Court»

They don81 want this

4

What they are saying is that the Executive can be just

5

as unconstitutional as he wants to and he can get away with it.

(6

The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment applies to everybody but

7

the Executive.

It doesn't apply to him.

8

Now let’s talk about the practical effect of a young,

:9

black militants, and the record shows that that is what the case

10

was here.

11

who had involved himself in the marches in Mississippi, had been

12

arrested for civil rights activities, had gone down and tried to

13

join the Army at one point, and they wouldn't take him because

14

he had been arrested for civil rights activity, and they had the

15

arrest on his record.

16

17

But he is good enough to be drafted, and he is good
!
enough to be drafted by a Board with the President of the United

18

Ku KXux Klan on it.

19

This was a young man, who had been over to Mississippi,

What kind of consideration is he going to get from that

20

kind of a Board?

21

to that Board, if he has a reconsideration of his case to be

22

made to that Board, and he did in this case,, what do you think

23
24
23

Nothing.

If he has an appeal he wants to make

that Board is going to think about him?
You read the minutes in this record of how the Board
treats policemen, firemen, people who corae in there who work for

He comes in with his mother and says, "For the first

3

time in my life 1 have a, good job.

I give $70 every two weeks to my mother."

This is what he needed to do.

Twice even his employer went down and said, "Look, he
is working with the poor in the City of New Orleans.

It is more

10

important, we think, for him to work in the lower Ninth Ward

11

with the black poor than it is for him to be drafted."

12

No.

No.

13

Q

Did the Board have the power to do anything at

14

15

the time that he brought that to their attention?
A

Mr. Justice Stewart, 1525.2 says that the Board

16

has discretion to reopen after a. notice of induction is issued.

17

We all know that.

18

That is not true.

The Government would say "You are powerless."

18

If you look in the minutes of the Soar'd that we put

20

in our brief, they had a policeman come in there after indue-

21

tion, and you know what they did?

22

23

Q
A

Delayed his induction.
They wrote to the State Director and asked him to

order the induction delayed.

But they didn't reclassify him.

They didn’t reclassify him.

But it is just a

backhanded way of giving him a deferment,

What circumstances over which he had no control?

That is DuVarnay #3, or something like that.
I say that they did do this and in all likelihood the

16

Board made the perfectly reasonable assumption that a 20-year-

17

old youth who finds himself with the first real steady job in

18

his life will be compelled by his conscience to support his

'19

20

mother and six brothers and sisters.

The mother had been

deserted by his father many years before«

21

I say that this was a change in circumstances of this

22

young man? and it was in effect because he had to support these

23

children? that it was beyond his control.

24

reasonable in that interpretation of 1625.2.

25

1 see nothing un­

Certainly we have to recognise that he was impelled to
8

i

a certain course of action and he was fulfilling his responsi­

2

bilities to his family.

3

and he goes right through every remedy — we don't have a Falbo

4

problem; we don't have an Estep problem — we have as much right

5

to exert Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment principles as Wolff

(6

did First Amendment principles in his case.

I say when that sort of thing happens,

They are no less dear to us, and no less important.

We use "parish”.

A parish is a county

It is a county.

10

He maintained a residence‘in New Orleans Parish, but

17

also, his main business, and where he lived, was with those Ku

18

Kluxers over in Bogalusa.

Q

But you are not —

20

A

I didn't get to that.

21

22

I was foreclosed.

I was

ready to go after him, but I wasn't given the opportunity.
Now, the Government makes a whole lot of business abotv

23

this failure to postpone or to appeal this I-A classification of

24

January 16, 1966.

25

Of course, I just call the Court's attention

to ...the fact that that is really irrelevant here, because when
10

1

he got classified in January from I-A to Il-S, he had nothing

2

to appeal front.

3

He was a young man who had dropped out of school? he was not

4

supporting anybody.

5

can’t be said to be a reason below.

6

to the composition of this Board.

He was properly classified in I-A at that time.

So there was no need to appeal.

So that

It doesn’t relate at all

Then I have to point out to the Court most respectfully

7
8

that this man had no way. of knowing who his Chairman was , what

9

his activities were.

He had no way of knowing whether that

Board was segregated or whether it had any Negroes on it or not.

10

He asked to go before the Board, and at one time he

11

12

was tentatively promised a chance to go before that Board, but

13

they took it back and wouldn’t let him go* so he has never even

14

laid eyes on the Board.
So 1 say again,, how could he know?

13
16

.

We didn’t know half

of this case until we started discovering it in the criminal

17

trial.

18

the criminal trial.

19

of the trial, they bring them in, and you see how this Board

20

operates.

21

these cases or not.

There was no way we could get the information ahead of

I think the whole thing is of a piece.

It was a Board

unconstitutionally made up.

23

it has to function in this case.

It was a Board, because of its un­

It is clear from the results
11

1

that the Board achieved in this case was not the kind of a board

2

that we ought to have sitting on these kinds of cases? that the

3

system had somehow or other been mismanaged, and that the result

4

is what you might expect — a perfectly valid hardship deferment

5

botched up and a young man being sent to jail for five years.

6

That, to me, is indicative of what happens when the

7

constitutional structures are ignored in the composition of thesn

a

boardso

9

years has ever recommended a Negro to serve on any of these

10

No Governor in the State of Louisiana in the last 25

boards, and we all know it.
Judge Christianberry, who tried this case, he knew it.

11

12

He knew the board was all white.

He said so.

Held we been able

13

to get more records, w@ could have gone further back than five

VI

years.

That was all the records they had available to him.
So I say to the Court we can’t waive something we

15
m

don't know about, and we can't waive something that is constitu­

17

tione 1.

IS

kinds of boards when we are raising constitutional issues and

19

the court below is saying simply, "Well, if you don't dot every

EG

'i' and cross every 't' and be very technical with the way you

21

handle yourself before these boards, then you are going to go to

22

jail and you are going to go to jail even though that board is

23

no more competent to send that boy to the Army than it would be

24

to send this Court somewhere.”

25

We can’t be held to be able to be put in jail by these

to his mother»

He goes in there and tells the Board about it.

10

But what does he get?

He gets this kind of a Board giving him

11

a fast shuffle, and that is what he got.
So I respectfully submit to the Court that we cannot

12
13

be held to waive constitutional issues»

This man has got to be

14

given his day in court, and he has got to be able to get up and

13

16

a lily white board.

It has a bad chairman»

He cannot waive those kinds of issues.

Q

Got what?

A

Got rid of Mr. Helm, the Chairman.

They got him

off that Board after this case was over, and 1 guess you could
go by cmo warranto and remove him.
But you see, we didn't even know what kind of board
we were working with, Mr. Justice Black, until we got right in
the middle of the trial.

Thera is no way for these registrants

you see, it is the responsibility of the system to police these
boards, not the responsibility of the registrants.

But we did

more good in exposing this kind of thing, I think, in this case
than the whole system had done for years down there.

They just

didn't care.
Q

On a wholly illegal board, would all the people

who had been drafted in the Army be illegally in the Army?
A

Well, I think if I were a black man who got

drafted by this Board No. 429

I would go see a lawyer'»

1 think

he ought to. If he has something he really wanted to. raise to
that Board, and tried to, he wasn’t going to get a fair shake.
He doesn't have to show that he didn't get a fair
shake.

I think you just show that that Board was what it was.
Q

How is it appointed?

of the State.

What is the exact state of the record on your

attempt to show the composition of this board?
A

11

The state of the record is this:

At the time of

the hearing on the motion to quash the indictment, Mr. Justice

13

Harlan, 1 started asking questions about whether any blacks ever

14

served on the Board.

15

got the U„ S. Attorney, who was with me there trying the case,

16

to admit in open court, before Judge Christenberry, that there

17

had been no Negroes who had served on that Board for the last

18

five years, as far as he knew.

were white.

MR. MARTIN:

fir. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I find myself in somewhat of a quandry in the way to

9

tG

approach the argument in this case, because it seems to me that

11

petitioner has ignored what is really crucial to the case that

12

is before this Court,, and that is the vital role that is played

13

in the Selective Service System by the provision embodied in the

14

regulations that once a notice of induction is sent to a regis­

IS

trant, the Local Board is precluded from reviewing that regis­

16

trant's classification unless it finds that there has been a

17

change in circumstances since the time that notice was mailed.

18

Q

Unless what?

IS

A

Unless there has been a change in the registrant's

20

circumstances.
To review briefly the facts here, petitioner,

21

22
23
24
25

ho had

been a student, dropped out of school in December of 1965.
January 19, 1S66 he was reclassified I-A.

On

On January 28, 1966

he was ordered to report for a physical examination on February
23 rd.
17

t

He did not appear on that day because he says that he

2

overslept»

3

He appeared on that day, was found physically acceptable for

4

service, and was then, on April 13, 1966 ordered to report for

5

induction on May 20th.

The physical was rescheduled for a date March 14th.

Petitioner contends

here, as of January 19, 1966,

7

the day he was classified I-A, there was no other classification

a

in which he could be put.

9

record is not clear on that.

He says that hs wasn't working.

The

He started to work sometime in

10

January, according to the record, but the exact date was never

n

clarified.
But petitioner's position is that that classification

12
13

was correct.

14

time, as far as we know, from anything in the record, that Mr.

13

Helm, who is the man they claim was the Klansman, had any con­

16

nection with the case.

17

I would clarify one point heres that is the only

All of the minutes of the Board meetings

after that date indicate that he was not present, and it had been

18

our assumption that he had gone off the Board in some intervening

18

time.

20

But in any event, petitioner says that January classi­

21

fication was correct.

22

its notice to report for induction, April 13th, on all the

23

information before it, petitioner was rightfully classified I-A

24

and he was, therefore, found physically acceptable and he was,

23

So therefore, the time the Board issued

1

therefore, a proper person to be ordered to report for induction
13

■3

He was so ordered»

2

All of the information which petitioner now contends

3

show that he was entitled to a deferment either because of the

4

hardship that would be involved to his mother and brothers and

S

sisters by his induction, or because of his occupation, none of

6

this information was brought to the Board's attention prior to

7

the time that notice to report for induction was sent, although

S

petitioner conceded at the trial, and I think concedes here, fchai

9

these facts did exist prior to the time the notice to report for

10

11

induction was sent.
So it is clear we have here a situation which totally

12

fits within the exact provision of 1625.2 where there has not

13

been a change in circumstances of the registrant subsequent to

14

the mailing of the notice to report for induction and, therefore

15

the Board is precluded by the regulations from reopening the

16

c1as sification.

17

It is the Government's contention here that petitioner s

13

failure to bring to the Board's attention the fact relating to

19

his hardship claim, or his claim for an occupational deferment

20

at a time when the Board could have considered the merits of

21

those claims, was, in fact, a failure to exhaust his administra­

22

tive remedies which, therefore, precluded the courts from pass\
ing on the validity of his classification at the time he was

23
24

25

ordered to report for induction and the time he failed to submit
to induction.

19

1

Q

Mr, Martin, may I ask when, with relation to the

2

time between the date he was ordered for induction and the date

3

that he was to be inducted does he allege that his condition

4

changed?

5

A

Mr. Chief Justice, he alleges no change. He con­

6

cedes that there was no change after he received his notice to

7

report for induction.

a

Q

When does he claim the change?

9

A

He says that the change occurred between January

10

19, 1966, the day he was classified 1-A, and April 13, 1966, the

11

day the Board issued its order to report for induction.

IE

no time during that period when this change occurred, according

13

to petitioner, did petitioner go to the Board and say "There has

14

been a change in my circumstances.

15

gave me, I-A, was right at the time, but now there are other

16

factors which I think show that I am entitled to either a hard­

17

ship or occtipafcional deferment."

18

But at

The classification which you

Had he.done so, the Board, under the regulations, could

19

have considered the facts, and if they found that the facts, if

20

true, would warrant the classification which he was suggesting

21

he was entitled to, if they said, "On the facts you present, if

22
23
24
25

they are true, there would be a hardship and we could give you
that classification," than the Board could have reopened his
classification, considered the facts, made its investigation,
and 1 think it is important here to point out that if the Board
i
20

1

was considering that classification, they would have had avail-

2

able to them several things they could have gotten.

3

could they examine the petitioner and his mother, but they could

4

have consulted local welfare agencies to determine -Q

Is it your position, do I understand you cor­

9

What I am saying —

rectly, that if these are the changed circumstances on which the

petitioner relies, they are not available to him after April

1?

13th because it is only the changes in circumstances which

12

occurred after that date over which he had no control which would

13

permit the Board to do anything at all about it?
A

14
15

That is correct.

Is that it?

That is our position.

That is

what the regulations provide.
What I am saying here simply is that if before the

16
17

time of the notice to report for induction, he had informed the

18

Board of these changes in circumstances, they may have, they

brothers and sisters.
Q

Well, I gather your point is that at that junc­

ture the boards would have had authority, power, jurisdiction,
call it what you will, to do something about it.
21

1

A

That is correct.

2

Q

But after April 13 they had no authority, power,

3

or whatever, to do anything as to circumstances which developed

4

before April 13th? is that it?
A

5

That is correct, Mr. Justice, and that is the

6

basic position we are urging: that once that notice to report

7

for induction came, the I-A classification was proper and there

8

was no basis on which it could have been challenged.

9

the court below was right that there had been a failure to ex­

10

haust his administrative remedies by not bringing to the Local

11

Board's attention at a seasonable time those factors which he

12

claimed authorised a change in his classification.

Therefore,

/

I think that this regulation is an important and vital

13

U

one within the framework of the Selective Service System.

15

think it embodies a principle, the necessity of which is self-

16

evident: that there has to come a time in the Selective Service

17

System when those who are charged with meeting draft quotas on

18

a month-to-month basis, can know with assurance that a classi­

19

fication is final and that a person classified I-A at that par­

20
21

22
23
24
25

1

ticular time will, in fact, be available to report for induction
on the date scheduled if he is mailed a notice to report for
induction.
It seems evident if the Local Board has to have 100
men to report for induction on May 20th, they have to go through
their list, find those people classified I-A, look at their
22

1

file and make sure that classificafion is proper, and then send

2

to those 100 people a notice to report for induction»

3

If, after that notice to report for induction is sent,

4

those 100 people each come in and say, "Now wait a minute»

5

are other claims I want to make as to my classification? I want

6

a deferment for hardship because of my occupation," et cetera,

7

then the Board would have no way of guaranteeing that it would

8

meet its commitment to the military service of this country to

9

provide 100 men to be inducted»
I think this is why this regulation is vital.

10

Theret

It is

11

why I think it is a reasonable regulation within the Selective

12

Service System»

13

cut-off date is not only the time a notice to report for induc­

14

tion is sent is one that is not only embodied in the regulations

15

but it is one that Congress itself recognised in enacting the

16

statute»,
It provided in section 6{a) of the Act that any person

17
18

I think it is also interesting fcoi note that this

who prior to the issuance of orders for him to report for induc­

19

tion enlists or accepts appointment in the Ready Reserve shall

20

be deferred.

21

also.

22

there has to come a time when the classification is final and

23
24
25

The Congress recognised with respect to Reservists

Yes, there is an interest in deferring Reservists, but

people can be ordered up and expected to report, and Congress
in the statute, as in the regulations, set that time as when the
notice to report, for induction is mailed to the registrant.

23

1

So I think that if that regulation is, as we submit,

2

a constitutional one, authorized by the statute, then the Local

3

Board at the time Mr, DuVernay came to present his claims was

4

precluded from acting on those claims and, therefore, he cannot

5

now contend that the action of the Board in denying those claims

6

was improper.

7

It was, in fact, proper.

It had a basis in fact.

His

8

classification was based on the facts as of the time the notice

9

to report for induction was sent to him and the Board, acting

10

pursuant to the regulation, could do nothing else but maintain

11

that classification,

12

13
14

Q

What was the last date upon which hs could make

an application for reclassification?
A

I think had he come in any time prior to the time

15

he was sent his notice to report for induction, the Board could

16

have considered the claim.

17

Q

That was January 19th.

18

A

He was sent the notice to report for induction

19

April 13th„

20

Q

Yes.

A

He was sent the notice to report on April 13th,

21

22
23

24
25

He was classified I-A on January 19th.

I think anywhere, anytime within those two dates, had he come
in, the Board would have had power to consider his claim.
I think it should be pointed out that the regulations
provide and, in fact, it appears on the back of the classification

a

classified, receives at the time — this is at the time petitioner

3

was classified, he received a card like this, which is the

4

Classification Certificate here, and right on the back of the

3

classification is printed the notice that "You are required to

6

have this notice on your possession."

7

Every registrant, when he is

Than the card says, and I am quoting:

"The law requires

8

you to notify your Local Board in writing of every change in

9

your address, physical condition, occupational, marital, family,

10

dependency, and military status, and of any other fact which

11

might change your classification within 10 days after it occurs.

ta

So petitioner was under an obligation under the

13

Selective Service regulations to report to his Local Board these

14

changes which he now claims made him eligible for deferment.

Can I ask you if that specifically answers his

contention by this question:
was not a valid board.

What he says is that the

Eoard

It wasn't a valid board, as I under­

stand it, when it classified him.

thereafter.
I am not indicating any belief about which is right,
whether he can raise it this way, but if he can raise it at all,
what difference does it make if this invalid board had a regu­
lation that he must present something to it in order to raise it
at a particular time?

How does that escape the question he is

presenting to us?
25

1

A

1 think, Mr. Justice,, it operates in this way:

2

His basic contention is that ”1 was improperly classified.5,1

3

says, "I was improperly classified because of the racial composi­

4

tion of the Board."

He

What we are saying first is, let us assume that he is

S
6

correct; that he was improperly classified; that the Board was --

7

strike "improperly classified."
Q

3

Let us assume that he is right.

Well, his contention is that he was improperly

3

classified by an illegal board and, therefore, he hadn’t been

10

classified at all and there is no basis for them ordering him

11

to present himself.
A

12

What I am saying in response to that is two

13

things:

14

stituted, that is, that Negroes were excluded, for the purpose

13

of argument, still there is patent, on the record, the fact

16

that there was no improper classification, because he concedes

17

that he was properly classified I-A.

18

giving rise to his claim of deferment occurred prior to the time

19

that he v?as ordered to report for induction, and under the regu­

20

lations, once he was ordered to report for induction, there was

21

22

One, that if accept that the Board was improperly con­

He concedes that the fact

nothing the Board could do.
Q

But he says that he was ordered by a board that

23

was no board, because he treats it, since he says there had been

24

no Negroes on it at all, as an invalid board and one which can­

25

not act at all.

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. MARTIN, ESQ,

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MARTIN;

7
8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Before the luncheon recess we were discussing the ques--

10

tion that if we assume for a moment that there may have been

11

racial discrimination in the composition of the Board, why the

12

courts should not have considered that claim on the merits.

13

I think our answers to that are twofold:

One, I think

14

what we are saying in the first instance is that this was a

15

Board, not looking to the racial composition for a moment, it

16

was a duly appointed board according to the procedures set forth

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

in the statute and the regulations and it was acting,
I think it would be our submission on this point that
in order for the action of that board to be held invalid because
of possible racial discrimination, there would have to foe some
indication, or at least a suggestion, that the board's action
could have been improperly motivated, but that does not appear
in this record.
It is conceded that the classification was proper. It
is conceded the facts weren't brought to the board’s attention
30

1

when they should have been.

2

could have been done by the Local Board after it sent out the

3

notice to report for induction»

So that, in effect, it is clear on this record that

racial considerations could have had no effect upon his classi-

S

fication.
Q

They wex'e choked off, Mr, Martin.

They weren’t

given an opportunity to prove it.

3

A

No, I don’t think so.

That is not true.

10

Q

It isn81?

11

A

The only thing at all in this record where they

12

were choked off was in showing that the member of the Board

13

and the only question asked at the time petitioner was classi­

14

fied I-A — wasn’t the head of the Board a member of the Ku Klux

13

Klan.

16

on which there was any cutting off.

17

ting off of the fact that at the time this man was classified

18

X-A, a classification which he concedes, and argues, in fact,

19

was the only one he could have obtained, there was a member on

20

the Board who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

21

Objection.

Sustained.

That was the only question asked
So all you have is the cut­

So X think it is apparent that even if that is true,

22

that petitioner's classification at that time could not have

23

been affected by racial considerations because he concedes there

24

was no other classification in which he could have bean put.

25

Q

Mr. Martin, you said before lunch that, in any
31

1

event? that was the claim that should have been taken, in the

2

first instance, to the Appeal Board or the National Board»

3

do you answer Mr. Smith's suggestion, "Well, how could we at that

4

time?

5

until the time of the criminal trial?"

We didn’t know the facts.

A.

6

How

We didn't discover the facts
How do you answer that?

I think the basic answer to that claim is what I

?

am suggesting; that there has to be, if there is any aspect of

8

racial discrimination come into play, some basis for suggesting

9

that the classification could have been affected by the racial

10

composition of the Board.
Q

ii

that if you had a Chairman who was a member of the Ku Klux KXan,

13

would you?

18

A

affected this particular registrant.

I think it would be clear,

Mr. Justice Brennan, for example, that if a white man had ap­
peared before the Board, had been denied a deferment —
Q

Well, there was evidence, as I understand it,

19

that white police officers, after they got notices of induction,

20

had no difficulty getting postponements that were tantamount to

21

as I understand it; is that right?

22
23

25

A

There was one instance in which the Board, in the

minutes, which reflected the fact that the Police Department madcjs
a request to the Board that it defer, for occupational grounds,
a man who had been ordered to reporp for induction.

32

i

What the Board did in that case was to say that they

2

could not reopen.

4

gesting to him that he might want to exercise his authority to

self reopen it.

But they sent a letter to the State Director,

That is all that i^as done.

be greatly affected if he has a valid claim for deferment which

Now which is it?

It is one of the two.

I think basically under the regulations they
What they could do is what he could do

They could ask the State Director to reopen his

classification.

I think that is something that he could have

done if he felt that he was improperly classified.
Q

Could 1 put another question here?

Supposing Mr,

Smith had made a formal proffer of proof at the trial which in­
cluded # among other things, that none of these factors that he
36

1

might have a3.lege.di- whatever they might be, were within his

2

knowledge or the knowledge of the draftee at the time of the I-A

3

induction notice, and that proffer of proof had been ruled out

4

on the ground that there had been no exhaustion.

5

What would have been the Government’s position then?

6

A

I thank the Government's position would have been.

7

Mr. Justice, that unless there was some reason to find the pos­

8

sibility of prejudice -- let us assume, for example, a Negro

9

registrant who comes in is improperly -'classified I-A.

He should

10

clearly be entitled, let us say, tg a student deferment.

1 thin:

11

there you may say, "All right, you can't hold it against him

12

that he didn't know that Negroes were excluded from his board."

13

But I think you still have to go a step further and 1

14

say, "But doesn't he in any event, even though he doesn't know

15

why he was improperly classified, doesn't he, if he is claiming

He can take that to an Appeal Board, and if he is un­
successful there he car, either, if it is a split decision, take
it to the Presidential Appeal Board, or either the State Directo:"
or the National Director can take that decision to the Presi­
dential Appeal Board.
I think this is something that is important also to

37

1

consider,.

Let us assume for a minute a man who is improperly

V

classified,, who knows that — a Negro who knows that Negroes

3

have been excluded from his board.

4

and we agreed that perhaps the constitutional question could not

be decided by the Appeal Board.

What can he do?

But what could be done is, Jfhe

fied I-A when I should have been IX-S, and the reason I was

9

classified was because the Local Board was prejudiced against me

10

because I was a Negro/’ that fact as to the reason for mis™

11

classification can be brought to the Appeal Board’s attention so

12

they will focus on the classification and realise that there is

13

this possibility that they have to carefully scrutinise the case

14

to determine whether or not I-A is the proper classification for

15

this registrant.

Yes, that is a de novo proceeding,

A

I am sorry.

They are bound by the record, aithouy

he can make a statement that accompanies the record and that is
a part of the facts that they can consider.
Basically, all they have to find is that a prima facie
case has been made out before the Local Board,

If ha alleges

the reason that he was denied his application was that they were
38

1

just prejudiced against him,, this is something that he can bring

z

to the Appeal Board's attention and they can take into their

3

mind in determining whether the classification is proper.
I think that is basically what we are talking about.

4
5

Is this man's classification proper at the time he is ordered to

report for induction,, and if it is so, it seems to me it is no

different than a man who is convicted by a court in the South in

16

should that be raised in some other fashion?

Absolutely.

But you are not saying, are you, that we have,

got to let it be raised in connection with every appointee of

the President?

Absolutely not.

That is exactly What I am saying/,

20

that you have to treat the people as validly there.

do try and determine is whether or not they have acted out of

22

racial motives, and where there is no evidence that they acted

23

for that reason, that the classification is valid.

that when there is an improper classification, that classifica­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN B. SMITH, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITH s

6

Mr. Smith?

I only have a few things I want to talk

about in connection with what has been said, Mr» Chief Justice.

7

I think that it ill becomes the Government to get up

8

here and say that there has been no prejudice in this case and

9

that there has to be shown to be prejudice»

We know very well

10

from the jury cases that have come before this Court and others

11

that if we show a pattern and practice of exclusion of black

12

people from juries, we don3t have to show prejudice. It is built

!3

right into the system? that it is there.
The jury cases don9t make you go out and show that you

14

15

would have gotten a better break from a properly constituted

16

jury.

17
18

We don't have to show that in this case, but it is all

over the record that we did get that kind of treatment, and I
will tell you why.
This man was not only classified by a bad board, but

19

20

when he tried to get his hardship deferment, it was still the
/

21

same white board that said no.
Look at the record, the way the clerk writes the

of the Board, not on a finding of something that happened after

the notice of induction went out, and that something being some­

thing beyond the control of the registrant, but they just acted

on the request and deferred him themselves, asking the State

Yes, sir.

The Board might have been exceeding its powers

in that case, too, under the regulations.

It might have been.

It might have been.

18

But at the same time, they say 1625.2 is so important

19

a regulation this Court has to preserve it.

20

important, why don’t they tell these registrants about it?

don’t they write them a book and tell them, "Look, if you don * t
