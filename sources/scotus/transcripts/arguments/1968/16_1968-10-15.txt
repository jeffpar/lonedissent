ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. YOUNGDAHL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

12

MR. YOUNGDAHL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
This Is an action by six large railroad companies

16

and a three-judge federal court in Arkansas against officials

17

of the State of Arkansas charged with enforcing two statutes.

ia

The first applies to companies with at least 30
.

19

miles of railroad tracks when those companies are operating

20

freight trains with 25 cars or more.

21

&n engineer, a fireman, conductor, and three brakemen.

It requires a crew of

22

The second statute applies to railroad companies

23

with at least 100 miles of new track when operating switch

24

trains over public crossings in urban communities.

It requires
(

25

that a crew of an engineer, a fireman, a foreman and three

?

helpers.

2

I represent four railroad brotherhoods who were

3

permitted to intervene in the lower court* speaking for the

4

employees affected by these statutes* and are defending

5

intervenors, defending appellants in this case.

6

At this stage of the case — the second time this

7

case has been heard -- at this stage of the case there are four

8

constitutional issues.

9

The Court below found that the statutes violated the

W

due process clause of the- 14th Amendment and constituted an

u

inpermissible burden on interstate commerce,

12

The railroads also urge in this appeal that there are

13

classification infirmities in the law in violation of the

34

equal protection laws and discrimination against Interestate

15

commerce.

16

The normal statement of the case does not apply, in

17

our view, to this controversy because it has been 50 or 60

18

years long.

19

case, it will be the eleventh entry in the U,S. Supreme Court

20

Reports on the same Arkansas statutes.

and the supremacy clause, arguing that the ICC Acts have ore-

there was Improvement in road and equipment, that some collecti ve

19

litigation dismissed the complaint, with an extensive discussion

20

about the cost of compliance, pointing out the railroads

completely failed to show that the relative cost of compliance

22

had increased.

affirmed in a memorandum opinion of the same year.

The three-judge court at that point thought that

Both of those arguments were rejected by the Western

The next discussion of this Court of the same statute
in question was in the landmark Southern Pacific against

10

Arkansas, in 19^5, where while a train length statute of Arkansas

11

was validated by this Court, the Court, in our view, took great

12

pains to distinguish the full crew law decisions to point out,

13

for example, those laws do require certain impediments in

14

interstate commerce, stopping at a state line, those impediment

15

were not of a kind that made them constitutionally valid and

16

pointed out that therein lies the distinction.

17

The next consideration by this Court of the Arkansas

18

full crew law was in 1966 in this same case.

19

the approach to the Court on the preemption issue was the

20

primary question at that time.

21

us on the preemption and we appealed and this Court reversed,

22

and in considering the preemption, the opinion of Mr. Justice

the preemption issue was presented narrowly, that is, had

about preemption?

The law was upheld and discrimination against interstate

commerce made by the railroad in 1966 was also injected on the

S

record before the Court at that time,,

6

Further, all recent reported decisions on the same

7

issues by Courts of other jurisdictions,outside of the

8

decision we are appealing from here, have upheld the con­

0

stitutionality of similar laws.

10

The Indiana Supreme Court refused to even take evi­

11

dence on these conditions,saying it is a matter for the

12

legislature.

13

The Ohio courts rejected all the identical constitutions

14

contentions and the New York courts in an extremely persuasive

15

opinion analyzed at great length the New York statute very

16

similar to Arkansas at the time of the trial.

by the Appellate Division and about two weeks ago it was

event to reiterate the intensive discussions about the duties

of firemen and the duties of brakemen and switchmen.

discussion has been engaged in so many times and it is sub­

4

stantially the same.

5

That

There is argument on both sides that there is room

6

for judgment by reasonable men both ways.

The judgment of the

7

State of Arkansas in its legislative process was it was im­

8

portant to the safety of the State to have these statutes.

9

to the duty of the firemen, the most notable kind of situation

As

10

is that firemen in the sense of a man shoveling coal into a

n

grate have long time ceased, but firemen in the sense of

12

maintaining motive power, keeping lookout, relief, Inspection

13

and emergency duty have under the sophisticated modern conditions

14

of railroading continue to exercise extremely important functions.

15

As to the brakemen, the outstanding conclusion from

16

the extensive record in this is that brakemen do substantially

17

now what they did in 1933.

18

the Court said they did in 1916 and 1911, in previous analyses

19

of these statutes by this Court.

20

They did substantially then what

As to the equipment and facilities, the evidence Is

21

that certainly there have been some improvements in railroad

22

conditions, railroad equipment and railroad facilities.

23

Certainly as well there have been some factors which have made

24

railroading more dangerous than railroading was in 1933 and

25

1916 and 1945.

There are faster and longer and heavier trains

9-

which are deteriorating and deteriorating the equipment and

crossings over which they pass.

Items like heavier highway traffic.

This factor combined with

The school bus program, for example, in Arkansas

5

was unknown at the time of the Norwood case and now it's a

6

large case involving the transportation of hundreds of children

over the crossings these trains pass.

Q

I gather your position is that, whatever may be the

merits, all of these arguments are bearing upon these facts

10

upon the question there is nothing for the Court to be concerne 5,

it is the legislature?

That is also our argument with respect to the burden

It's not for the Arkansas legislature to determine

with unbridled discretion how much to burden interstate

22

that would be this:

My response to

The second evaluation is judicial, if

In this instance there is a legislative evaluation

2

of the kind of thing this Court did in Southern Pacific against

2

Arkansas, for example, the extensive evidence was taken on the

3

importance of crews to safety before Congress, and the last

4

decision of this Court analyzed some of that legislative

3

history.

6

7

Congress decided expressly, at least in expressed
legislative history, not to preempt, so this Court found.

8
9
10

The reason for that decision, we would submit, is a
determination on the merits that there is some ground for States
making these decisions.

11

I would suggest that that would be a considerable

12

impact on the evaluation of this court even under the burden

13

on commerce arguments.

14
13
16

Q

Then, of course, there are two other claims that

you have to meet?
A

Equal protection and discrimination.

Perhaps I might

17

refer briefly to that.

18

cations which somehow the classifications aren't firm.

19

Beth of them say there are classifi­

Our first argument is those questions have been

20

resolved before.

21

the 1500 mile mileage track made by the railroad is that exempt

22

companies switch over the same crossings as non-exempt companies.

23

The primary basis for the exemption argument,

This exact point was discussed and was a major

24

element of discussion in the 1916 Arkansas full crew case in

23

this court, St. Louis, I.M. & S. Railway v. Arkansas, finding
11-

-

1

that while maybe the classification wasn’t perfect, there

2

seemed to be a considerable difference between 50-mile and

3

100-mile railroads and large railroads.
Q

4
5

Very little has happened to the equal protection

law since 1916«
A

6

That is true, your Honor.

But a good deal has not

7

happened to Arkansas railroading with respect to that kind of

8

fact.

9
10

11

Q

What does the length of the whole line have to do

with the safety of an individual?
A

We can think of several things.

The record shows

the following kind of facts.

14

go 75 miles an hour.

companies shows the speed limit of 75 miles per hour for the

company that I happen to recall.

As to the interstate against intrastate discriminatio n
argument, there is not a perfect correlation.
Q

That could also be couched as an equal protection

argument as well?
A

Either way the classification is infirm in some way.

14

As to those arguments, the record In a number of respects

15

shows important distinctions.

16

Furthermore, the interstate intrastate dichotomy

17

does not fit the exemption dichotomy.

18

are interstate railroads not covered by the statute because

13

they do not have 50 or 100 miles of line, and vice-versa.

20

So it is not a perfect, as the railroads would probably suggest 9

21

but the facts on the record show it is not.

22

In other words, there

One further aspect of the 50 or 100 mile classification
9

which would support the classification as such, in our view,

10

the railroads make great arguments out of the fact that cost

11

of compliance is high.

12

In a moment.

13

clearly It could be — the smaller railroad companies, I

14

suppose, are less able to assume the cost of compliance with

15

these statutes, and that might legitimately be a factor in

16

classification, not one that we would rely on wholly, but

17

certainly a factor.

18

I would like to say something about thaf;

But. if the cost of compliance is a factor -- and

Outside of the multitude of evidence on duties of

19

employees and the equipment and facilities of the railroads,

20

the most persuasive part of the record altogether, in our view,

21

is a mass of statistical material.

This Is the first time in Arkansas full crew law

cases, of the many that have been in this Court, and the first

very hazardous business and continues to be.

substantially; and, number 4, that when you analyze those

18

accidents and you find those that are most attributable to

19

crew size and crew performance, those accidents have increased

20

especially and the rate of those accidents has increased

21

especially.

22

A cause and effect decision, we say, is primarily

23

legislative, but there are some things to assist in that kind

24

of evaluation here.

25

For example, collisions.

It is conceded by all the

parties that collisions are that type of accident most attribu

that the amount of train accident dollars damage,, in order to

years, but the fact is that the Department of Transportation

12

Arkansas train accidents have been increasing at a

slower rate than states with smaller operating crews, and

during periods with the same traffic density, casualty rates

are no less for diesel than for steam locomotives; and compar­

might be.
Certainly the railroads have ignored, for example,

the fact in places where engineers ride without a fireman,

to the engineers.

Is there a switching crew law involved?

A

Yes, sir, your Honor,

Two statutes.

One for freight

over the road service, and one for switching in the yards.

It's the same argument?

A

As far as any legal standard, I don't see any differ-j

ones.

19

There are some factual differences, substantial

For example, the railroads argue when a train is on

20

the road that they can put an extra brakeman in the cab thereby

21

making the fireman unnecessary.

22

where all the brakemen have to be passing signals and things

23

of that kind and the fireman himself has to be passing signals.

the people involved.

But there is a factual argument in terms of dis­

crimination against the interstate commerce?
A

Wellj there is.

That applies only to the freight

crew law, I presume, or the burden on commerce argument would

apply under the freight crew laws because the switching crews

are not in an interstate kind of situation.

In my presentation I will touch on some points con­

I will also discuss some phases of the Brief that

led the District Court to conclude that these statutes in

safety of railroad operations as they are conducted over the

United States and particularly as they are conducted today in

Arkansas.

11

statutes constitute an inpermissible discrimination against

constitutional issues which, of course, it had not undertaken

to decide in granting the summary judgment that it had earlier

17

This Court rejected that argument and remanded the case

As we understand the plain language of this Court’s

decision on the earlier appeal, this simply meant that the

Complaint filed in this case in April of 1964 sufficiently

alleged facts that would cause these statutes to be un­

21

constitutional, if those facts were proven; and if the rail­

22

road companies could prove what they had alleged in the

23

Complaint, they were entitled to the relief sought.

24

25

It was in this context that the District Court on
remand scheduled and then undertook a massive trial on a
-28-

massive record.

2

As Mr. Youngdahl indicates, over 100 witnesses

3

testified, a tremendous volume of other evidence and exhibits

4

were received by the Court, all directed toward permitting the

5

District Court to decide the simple factual issue of whether

6

these Arkansas statutes in practical operation today really

7

have any rational relationship to railroad safety.

8
©

I stress that the issues addressed to the District
Court are almost entirely factual and not legal.

As that

10

Court indicated in its own opinion, the opinion from which this

11

appeal is prosecuted, the governing legal principles are clear

12

and indeed are not substantially disputed.

13

based on the massive record before it, made this factual

14

finding:

15

The Court then,

"We find from the overwhelming weight of the evidence

16

that by the mid 1950's, if not before, the firemen on the

17

diesel locomotive and the third brakeman or helper had in

18

general ceased to perform significant safety functions in the

19

operation and switching of freight trains and cars."

20

Those findings of fact on this record supporting

21

those findings of fact led inevitably to applying the

22

constitutional principles that had been established by this

23

Court to the lower Court's central holding in this case, which

24

was that under present conditions continued enforcement of

reasonableness of the statutes remained after assessment of

the evidence fairly debateable, the statutes would be sustained

6

because that Court, like this one, does not sit to pass a

legislative judgment.

But it found that, conceding as late as Norwood,
that the statutes, the reasonableness of the statutes in that

factual context 35 years ago, was reasonably debatable, that

it does not continue to be debatable today on this record, and

that the continued debate of it by the Brotherhood does not

make it so.

14

On the commerce clause test, the Court observed that

since the statutes had a distinct impact on Interstate

commerce, it was required to make the judicial appraisal to

17

weigh the purported local benefits to be derived from the,

1©

statutes against the national Interest in an unfettered flow

of Interstate commerce free from local restraint.

unfettered commerce and the train link law was declared ■
unconstitutional.
The Court also relied upon Morgan versus Virginia,
where the Court measured the validity of passenger on inter­
state conveyance by race against the commerce clause, that is
the context in which it was presented gave great stress to the
need and desirability of uniformity of regulation of Interstate
commerce and found that uniformity in that sort of regulation
ordering the seating of passengers on interstate conveyances
was desirable in a constitutional sense and that the statutes
therefore must fall.
I point out that the burden here on interstate
commerce of the full crew law is far greater than that of the
statute in Morgan against Virginia.
There the pa33engers could move in accommodation to
conflicting state regulations as the conveyance moved from
state to state.

The conveyance didn't have to be stopped and

presumably no cost was incurred to the interstate commerce in
complying with that statute.

Here the trains must stop or slow

to comply with the statute, and here the impact of cost of
compliance is overwhelming.
The Court concluded, and we submit correctly so,
that the statutes are not reasonably related to safety and
that that is not fairly debatable by the present day railroad
operations, and it concluded that any contribution to the
-

38

-

«p

statutes might toe argued to safety would be entirely out of

2

proportion to the reported benefits they confer.
It is suggested in the appellants brief that an

O

‘

4

economic justification can be offered as alternative to support;

5

the validity of these statutes.
The case made below -- the factual case made below --

6

7

is so one way that the appellants feel that the need to offer

8

an alternative at this stage, and in their motion Intervening

9

they set out what that alternative was, what their interest

10

was In this case.

They said their interest was that they

11

represented the employees whose jobs were protected by these

12

statutes, who might lose their jobs if the statutes were

13

repealed, and they also had the further interest that if they

14

had a diminution of membership as a result of the declaring

IS

invalid these statutes, it would cost the organization of

16

Brotherhoods a loss of income.
The District Court rejected that argument and said

17
18

the earlier cases, including the decisions of this Court,

19

had authoritatively characterized these statutes as safety

20

statutes.

21

that the statutes might well be violative of the constitution

22

of Arkansas if it was attempted to measure or support them on

23

an economic justification rather than safety.

24
25

Then it accepted that characterization and indicated

The Supreme Court of Arkansas said, in the first one
of these cases to come before it in 1908, that this legislatior

can only be supported on account of the proposed motion of

justices of the New York Court of Appeals were unanimous on

11

that issue alone that the statute had to stand or fall on its

12

contribution to safety.

13

Of all the evidence in the record, the most persuasive

14

and most dramatic, as I think of the absurdities of these

15

statutes and of the real impact they have on interstate

16

commerce, are these absurd, rituals at or near the Arkansas

17

line that they require in putting on and taking off men as a

train moves from another State into Arkansas, or from Arkansas

19

into another State.

20

There are many examples of these extra employees

21

placed on the train for the sole purpose of complying with

22

the Arkansas statute.

On. the safety issue, the District Court made several

critical findings.

It found, first, that from the overwhelming

weight of the evidence and since the mid 1950's neither the
fireman on the diesel locomotive or third brakeman or helper
contributed to safety of railroad operations.

7

The District Court also found, without regard to

8

employee categories, that trains have been operated safely

9

in other parts of the United States for many years with crews

JO

of less than six men of the size required by the Arkansas

II

statute, and that the train operations with these smaller

12

crews had been conducted with safety.

13

District Court concluded that from the evidence as a whole,

14

under present circumstances, continued enforcement of the

15

statutes makes no significant contribution to railroad safety.

'16

And, finally, the

In reaching these conclusions and making these

17

findings, the District Court relied heavily on evidence of

18

comparable and safe operations with smaller crews.

IS
20

21

In other cases involving identical issues, the Courts,
have relied on the same type of evidence.
In the Weinberg case, which is referred to and

22

discussed in our Brief, the Court relied on evidence of

23

comparable and safe operations with 44-ton yard switching

24

diesels without a fireman, and found the ordinance requiring

25

a fireman on that type of equipment to be unconstitutional.
43-

?

In the Southern Pacific case, particuarly, this
Court relied extensively on evidence of safe operations in

3

states outside of Arizona, operating three of the seventy car-

4

limitation imposed by Arizona! and it concluded,on the basis

5

of such safe operations in other states, that the Arizona

8

limitation had no reasonable relation to safety.

7

The record in the present case permits the same type

8

of comparison and strongly supports the District Court’s

9

conclusion that the statutory requirements at issue do not

10
n

promote safety of operations.
This compared to the evaluation is greatly facilitated

12

by the changes in crew size which have occurred since 1964 as

13

a result of the award of arbitration board number 282.

14

award, which was applicable to virtually every major railroad

15

in the United States, resulted in the elimination of a

16

majority of the firemen positions and a reduction in the number

17

of brakemen and helpers used on crews in road and yard service.

That kind of claim could be and apparently was made

10

in the Arizona case, that being the state law that limited the ;

11

length of trains limited the numbers of freight cars on a

12

train* the claim being that if there were shorter trains there

13

would be more trains and therefore more grade crossings*

14

et cetera.

15
16

You don't have that argument?
A

No.

Perhaps the most graphic of the comparisons

17

which the record permits involves the Arkansas operations of

18

the plaintiff railroads in this case and their operations in

IS

other states.
As these railroads reduce their crews under the

20
21

provisions of the award of arbitration board number 282. it

22

became and it remains commonplace for trains in through service

23

on these railroads to operate with identical characteristics

24

through Arkansas and adjacent states except for differences in

25

crew 3ize.

45

-

-

1

The size of the train, Its motive power, the

2

frequency or infrequency of stops, the characteristics of

3

tracks, signal protection and terrain remain comparable.

4

the size of the crew changes from the four-man crew in other

5

states to the six-man crew required by the Arkansas statutes.

6

Only j

Trains of the Frisco railroad operating over Its

7

mainline from Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee undergo these

8

crew changes as they pass into and out of Arkansas.

9

Trains of the Rock Island operating from Tennessee

10

to New Mexico have the same experience, going from four-man

11

crews in other states to six man-crews in Arkansas.

12

And the Missouri Pacific and the Cottonback have a

13

large volume of interstate operations which also proceeds

14

identical in operating features and characteristics except

15

for difference in crew size.

16

In yard service, Mr. Light has pointed out there

17

are instances where a border bisects the yard and where four-

18

man crews do the switching at one part of the yard and six-man

19

crews do the switching when they are required to go into

20

Arkansas.

21

The other part of the record on this, in addition

22

to the changes in crew size, is the evidence which shows the

23

relative safety of operations of the plaintiff railroads in

24

Arkansas and in other states.

25

The record shows that during the five-year period

46

-

i

1

which is the most recent five-year period available at the time

2

of the trial, from 1961 to 1966, casualties arising from train

3

operations were reduced by 13 percent in Arkansas and sixteen

4

percent in other states through which the plaintiff railroads

5

operate,

I am referring now to the report of casualties

Commission,

Casualties?

13

Q

How about the accidents?

14

A

Accidents, your Honor, are comprehended under the

Interstate Commerce Commission in terms of train accidents.
A train accident, to be reportable to the Interstate

17

Commerce Commission, must involve one basic requirement.

'18

must involve property damage to railroad equipment arising out

19

of the operation of trains of at least $750.

20

22

Since 1961 there has been a trend of Increases in

Collisions are one of

There has been an increase in train accidents
reportable to the Interstate Commerce Commission since 1961.

-47-

1

But the fact is that casualties, injuries to people, arising

2

out of those incidents, has been declining since 1961,

3

that by 1967 there was a 25 percent reduction in the casualties

4

or injuries to people arising from these train accidents,

5

Q

So

Might that not be fortuitous, just because of the

6

fact you didn’t happen to have any very large accidents that

7

killed a great number of people?

8

due to the fact that the railroads have taken off most of their

9

passenger trains where people might be killed?

10

A

And might not that also be

The evidence, your Honor, shows that the reason for

11

this increase In reportable train accidents is primarily the

12

fact that the standard is stated in terms of damage to equip­

13

ment, and that one of the features involved in determining

14

the damage to equipment is the amount of cost involved in

15

repairing the equipment.

18

remained inflexible since 1961, has resulted in an increasing

17

number of Instances falling within the reporting requirements.

And this $750 standard, which has

As equipment costs have increased, as labor costs

19

have gone up, the proportion of instances in which a mishap

20

becomes a reportable; train accident has also increased.

21

So that the basic point that the record establishes

22

in this connection is that, insofar as safety is concerned

23

in terms of injuries to people, there has been an improvement

24

in that and that there has been at least a comparable improve­

25

ment in states that do not require six-man crews.

-48

f

1
2

Q

Wouldn't that be a direct reflection of the fact

that there are fewer people in the crew?
In a train accident, the people most likely to be

3
4

hurt are the crew of the train.

And if there are only four

5

on there, Instead of six, that could account for fewer

6

casualties?

7

A

That could account for some of them, your Honor, but

S

the fact is that only a very small number of train accidents

9

have a potential for casualties,

10

The reported data for 1967 shows approximately 7200

14

vicinity of ten percent of train accidents that result in

15

casualties of any kind.

16

accidents are allocated to specific accidents so that you take

17

Into account the fact that some produce two casualties and

19

others do not produce any, only six and a half percent of the

19

train accidents Involve casualties.

20

The reportable casualties for 1967 to
So on its

And when the casualties in train

So our basic point is that the discussion of train

21

accidents, the emphasis on what has happened to train accidents,

22

is a concern with mishaps Involving property damage that became

23

increasingly reportable because of the yardstick to which I

24

referred,

25

Q

I suppose you would agree that every collision
„49..

1

carries with it the possibility of casualty, wouldn't you?
A

2
3

No, I would not, your Honor.

May I state my basis

for it?
The collisions that we are referring to here, your

4
5

Honor, are not primarily collisions between two trains moving

6

in the same direction or even between two trains moving, I

7

mean, in opposite directions, or two trains moving in the same

8

direction.

9

The Commission's classification of collision also

10

includes collisions from one car racking the side of the other

11

and it includes and there are reported as a great many collisions

12

what happens when a car goes over the hump of the yard at too

13

great a speed and runs into another car at the receiving track

14

and classification yard and property damage of $750 occurs.

'15

That is a collision.

16

There may not be an employee within a great distance

17

of that event.

18

that collisions inevitably involve a potential for casualties

19

because many of them occur when there is no potential for

20

casualties.

21

Q

So I would have to disagree with the statement

I suppose if one of the cars went over an embankment

22

it might be a casualty so far as some of the employees are

23

concerned?
A

24
25

It might be, yes, if there were employees in the

area.
50

1

2

Q

Wouldn’t there be employees on the train if one of

them went over the embankment?

3

A

Not the switching ears to which I am referring.

4

You are referring to a train operating over the line which

5

goes over an embankment?

6

Q

Yes.

7

A

The employees are in the caboose and on the head

8

end.

9

the employees may be a long distance from the point of derail­

!0

If the derailment occurs in the middle of the train

ment .

H

Q

Does that mean they wouldn't be hurt?

32

A

They might te hurt in the caboose from a sudden

13

stop.

14

would be fairly remote on a 150 car train where one of the

15

middle cars derails and goes over the embankment.

16
17

18

But the likely hood of any injury in the locomotive

Q

You don't think that would endanger anybody who

happened to be in the caboose?
A

There would be a sudden stop in the caboose and

19

unless the men were properly braced there might be an injury,

20

But the caboose itself would not necessarily go over the

21

embankment.
It wouldn't have to go over the embankment in order

22
23
24
25

to have a casualty, would It?
A

Moi there could be a casualty from that type of

accident.
-51

Q

It seems to me we had a recent case In this court

where someone sitting in the caboose, because of a very slight
accident up above, was hurt very severely.
A

It is possible for that type of casualty to occur

when the train stops suddenly and when the occupants of the
caboose are not braced and they are bounced around in the
caboose, and that does happen.
But to return just a moment, your Honor, to the
collision that you inquired about earlier, the collisions that
you inquired about earlier, page 9^3 of the record.
Q

Would you say from just as a matter of common sense

that an increase in the number of collisions was not a safety
factor and that It could be seriously considered in a matter
of this kind?
A

I would not say that.

I think an increase in the

number of collisions, without any explanation of why they are
Increasing, would be something of very great significance in
a case of this kind.
What I have tried to do is to explain the reasons
why the reportable statistics do not portend anything of
great significance with respect to the safety of individuals.
Q

Is there anything in the reportability of accidents

that would affect the collision part of your argument as to
xvhether there mifeht be casualties or not?
A

Mo.

The standard to which I refer, the $750 standard

-52

1

does not relate directly to the casualty potential of the

2

collision.

3

Q

I understood counsel to say that in Arkansas,or in

4

other states there was a much greater increase in collisions

5

during a given period recently than in Arkansas.

8

A

I don't believe there

is data available which shows collisions by states.
Q

Not by states but the rest of the country, it was

considerably higher than in Arkansas.

10
15

I did not understand that.

Is that true?
A

The data that I am familiar with in the record does

12

not permit a comparison between Arkansas and the rest of the

13

country insofar as collisions are concerned.

It does in so far as the entire category of train

22

engineers, I emphasize, as a remaining member of the engine crews

23

and yard service, have a most immediate and direct interest in

24

safety of operation.

25

engineers had been participating in such operations for a period

When the report in question was made, the

55

1

of almost two years and the organization undertook to make its

eu

r\

study representative of railroads throughout ,fhe United States.

3

The Grand Chief of the Brotherhood, relying on these studies,

4

stated in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce

5

of the United States Senate that the removal of firemen under

6

the award had not adversely affected the safety of the remaining

7

employees, and I am quoting, ''That engineers are now efficiently

8

and safely moving their trains over the road."
I emphasize again that this was a study by the Brother­

9
0

hood of Locomotive Engineers based on data submitted by its

1

members who had been observing operations without firemen for

2

two years and that study supports the judgment of the District

3

Court.

4

Q

5

Was there any question in there about the engineers

getting more money if they didn't have a fireman?
A

Under agreements made with the Brotherhood of Locomo­

1

tive Engineers there have been wage increases which were appli­

cable to operations without firemen.

made.

5

That type of agreement was

Thank you.

4

In other words, the first

Q

Could I ask you just one question.

What if the Court

disagreed with you on your contention that these laws are not

56

1
2

related to safety?
A

Have you lost the case there?

1 take it under the authorities, Your Honor,

that we

3

do have the burden of showing that the safety benefits, if any,

4

arriving from the statutes cure--

5
6

Q

If we disagree with you on that, do we then have to

reach the discrimination question?

7

A

I think the discrimination and equal protection,

0

Q

They are both related to safety,

3
10

11

I assume they can

be discriminatory?
A

Yes

,,

the discrimination and equal protection arguments

might still be valid.

12

Q

So the lower court has not passed on that?

13

A

That's right, the lower court did not pass on those

14

two points.

15

Q

Do you think that the very factors that would show

16

these laws are related to safety would also show there is a dif­

17

ference between 50-mile trains and longer trains?

18

|

A

The statutes in question, Your Honor, apply with

13

respect to lengths of the road in the state and switching opera­

20

tions for a large railroad can be precisely the same as switching

21

operations for a small railroad.

22
23
24
25

Q

Unless your opponents were saying that the longer road:;

have longer trains?
A

But in switching operations, Your Honor, the longer

trains would not effect the movement of the cars within the
57

switching yard.

When the train first comes

into the yard,, it

is broken up and operations thereafter are in terras of cuts of
cars, which in most instances are the same regardless of the s.iz<
of the train that comes into the yard.
Q

How about the freight that, would operate the switching

A

The freight operations, the question of whether the

length of the line means anything with respect to the size of
the crew, Your Honor, is answered, I believe, in the evidence by
the fact that the arbitration award of Board No. 282 laid down
a series of guidelines which provided considerations to be taken
into account by special boards in determining what the size of
the crew should be on a particular run or assignment.
Q

This is the same kind of an argument that goes to

whether or not these laws relate to any safety at all or not?
A

The argument does depend on that.

Q

So that if the lav/s are related to safety, you would

also lose your discrimination argument, at least in the freight
area?
A

I believe, though, there is still a valid inquiry as

to whether the 100-mile limit and the 50-mile limit is a differentiating circumstance as far as our safety is concerned.
Q

Even in the freight area?

A

Even in the freight area.

Over the road the 100-mile

railroad might haul a 150-car train, which is then interchanged
Q

Do you think we can decide that issue here?

58

2

A

The record does contain.a great deal of evidence of the

operation.

3

Q

We don't have anv findings on that?

4

A

There are no findings on that point, but there is a

5

great deal of evidence on the operation of the small railroads.

Ordinarily

would

If the question turns on equal protection and the dis­

crimination against Commerce's point, I believe that perhaps it

should be remanded to the lower courts for the taking of further

evidence and for the findings on this issue.

Q

Was there evidence taken on it?

There was evidence taken on it, Your Honor, and we put

in a considerable amount of evidence on that.

MR. YOUNGDAIIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;

2

With reference to Mr. Justice White's last point in

3

the general issue about the justification of a 100-mile classi-

4

fication in the switch yard, to be overly candid, perhapd, I

5

shudder at the fact of going back to try this case again.

6

Q

It would not be a matter of trying it again.

Weren't

7

the issues which were made up in the Trial Court included dis­

0

crimination and equal protection?

9

A

That is correct.

10

Q

And the record was made and closed with those issues

11

in it?

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

It is just a question of findings then.

14

A

I understand, Your Honor, that the compelling principle

15

in a constitutional challenge is the plaintiffs have the burden

16

of showing that the law is unconstitutional.

17

that the Court is well familiar with which state that if any stat 0

18

of facts is known or can reasonably be conceived of, that is

19

sufficient.

There are cases

There is a good deal of evidence in here that --

Q

21

Some cases may have said that in the equal protection

area, but do you think that they have said that in the commerce

area?

I don't understand commerce to be involved.

Or in discrimination of interstate commerce?

As discriminated against interstate commerce, our
