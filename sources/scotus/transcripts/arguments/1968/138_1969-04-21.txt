Representative Bingham, the author of the 14th Amend­

exclusion of Senator Langer by the Senate, and the eminent
Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee today, Emanuel Celler,

In urging the people of the State of New York to

ratify the Constitution, Robert Livingston said to the people

9

of New York that the Constitution was grounded on this prin­

10

ciple; that tkva people are the best judges of whom ought to

Having these difficulties, respondents reach back into

otherwise duly qualified representatives of the people, upon th«

But I suggest to the Court this is fantastic, that it

turns history upon its head, that the Wilkes case was the very

19

theories and actions of the British Parliament of George III

20

which were at the very core of American opposition, the British

This has at least proven to me the wisdom of Mr. Justice:

22
23
24
25

So I suggest that

Holmes8 comment that a page of history of worth a volume of
logic.

But I suggest to the Court that this understanding that

the. founders insisted that the Legislature was to have no power
10

I

to refuse to seat an otherwise duly qualified representative of

2

the people is the key to the question of justiciability and is

3

the key to the question o£ the role of this Court in this case.
In this case* as in Baker/Carr;, non justiciability has

4

S

become little more than a play on words* for Baker/Carr teaches

S

that the test of nonjusticiability in the political question

7

doctrine is deciding whether & matter has been in any way com­

8

mitted by the Constitution to another branch of Government* or

9

whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority

10

has been committed.
As Justice Harlan pointed out* in his opinion in Baker/

11
12

Carr* it is quite necessary to cut through the thicket of dis­

13

cussion about justiciability and get to the point as to whether

14

a complaint discloses a violation of a Federal constitutional

15

right.

15

This inquiry* the Court has taught us all in Baker/Carr,

17

requires a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation

18

and it is the responsibility of this Court* as the ultimate

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

interpreter of the Constitution* to make it.

This is the key to

this case. The question as to who may be the freely chosen
representatives of the people has not been confided by.the
Constitution to the exclusive control of the Legislature.
Quits to the contrary* it has been confided by the
Constitution to the ultimate branch of Government* the sovereign
people* in the written document they established as their
11

'

1

fundamental lav;®

2

of representative government requires that the free choice of

3

the people's representatives remain with the people, subject

4

only to the qualifications they, themselves, laid down in their

5

Constitution.

This is because the fundamental premise itself

So under the teachings of the Court in Baker/Carr, this

6
7

is a case in which judicial power must be exercised, where the

8

action of the Legislature has exceeded the authority committed

9

to it.
It is suggested that relief here would violate separa­

10
11

tion of powers.

12

to preserve the powers reserved to the sovereign people by the

13

Constitution.

14

and the words of the Chief Justice in Marbury are decisive heref

15

and his question is the question we must all answer; to what

16

purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limi­

17

tation committed to writing if these limits may bt any time be

18

passed by those intended to be restrained?

21

22
23
24
25

Relief here is required

This is the most historic role of this Court,

Let me speak frankly at this points

19

20

The contrary is true.

What is at the

heart of the reluctance of the lower courts to grant relief here i?
It is their fear of a confrontation with the House. But this
fear, in itself unreal, since in the words of this Court, it
is an inadmissible suggestion that the House would not accept
this Court's role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitu- j
iion.

This fear would paralyse the Court in its most important

12

1

function

2

which is a written Constitution,

3 |

respondents have power would, in the Chief Justice's words in

4

Marbury, subvert the very foundations of all written constitu­

5

tions o

A fear to act here because

At another crisis point in the history of this Court,

6

7

to preserve a rule of law, the foundation stone of

this Court said in Cooper against Aaron, that Marbury declared

8 I the basic principle that, the Federal Judiciary is supreme in
9

the exposition of the law of the Constitution and that this

10

principle has been respected by this Court and by the country

11

as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional

12

system.

13

The reaffirmation that this is a government of laws and

14

not men, that representative government means that ultimate

15

power remains with the people, is particularly necessary when

16

the crisis arises in a context in which black citizens are

17

18
13

20
21
22

23
24
25

denied the right to elect their own black representative who
had risen to great heights of legislative leadership.

It is

difficult, indeed, to demand law and order of American citizens
if the Legislative Branch itself denies the first assumptions
of an ordered society, the right of people to govern themselves
Thus, to grant relief here would not only be to re- .
affirm the fundamentals of a representative government, but it
would reaffirm the fact that the principles of popular sover­
eignty are equally applicable to citizens black and white.

in Baker/Carr, would be in the greatest tradition of this Court..,

ARGUMENT OF HERBERT 0= REID., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR, REID:

7

May it please the Courts

We have attempted

8

to argue in our brief and orally, first, that Congress did not

9

have the power to exclude Congressman Adam C» Powell? that what

10

it did and how it did it raised further constitutional objec­

11

tions

0

IE

At the outset, the two Judges on the Court of Appeals

13

tried to treat this matter of exclusion as a matter of expul­

14

sion and I think clearly that should be laid to rest in the

IS

beginning„

16

When Congress was organised, when the House organised

17

on January 3, 1969, the very same resolution which had been pro­

13

posed on March 1, 1967, the subject matter of our discussion

19

here, the same resolution was proposed»

20

upon to rule on whether or not a motion to expel was germane to

21

his seating, or a motion to exclude, to which the Speaker ruled

22

on January 3ri that such a motion was not germane? that on the

23

seating of a Congressman, the only question open to the House

24

was the three qualifications.

£5

The Speaker was called

Also, the Speaker ruled on March 1st that since this was;
14

1 ; a question of seating,, that the necessary vote was a majority
2 j vote, and not the two-thirds which would have been required if
j
j

3 |
4

it had bean a matter of expulsion.
The Justices below suggest that this is a'n immaterial

5

distinction, since the vote was large enough to satisfy the

6

two-thirds requirement.

7

What we argue here is that, of course, the motives of

8

the Members of the House in voting cannot be inquired into to

9

determine how they would have voted were the issue expulsion.

IQ

But more fundamentally, this was at the bottom, and grounded on

n

the precedents of the House as demonstrated in the Speaker on

12

the later ruling on January 3, 1969.

13

that the Speaker's earlier ruling that the vote was on exclu­

14

sion, because the House could not expel for conduct in a pre­

15

vious session, and there was no question that the conduct

IS

alleged herein had taken place in Congresses previous to the

17

90th Congress, the 88th and the 89th„

18

Q

These precedents dictated

What is the basis of that statement, Professor

19

Reid, that the House could not expel for conduct in previous

20

sessions?

21

22
23
24
25

A

The precedents of the House, sir, the Speaker out­

lined the precedents of the House when he ruled on January 3,
1969, which we have' included a copy of, the record of January
3rd, in which he said that he anticipated that this question
would be raised and, therefore, he had had it briefed.
15

It was

1

a very long and detailed ruling by the Speaker at that par­

2

ticular time citing the House precedents.
Q

There is not a judicial lav/ that says that, is

5

A

Sir?

6

Q

There is no judicial opinion that supports the

3
4

7

there?

statement you are making, is there?
A

8

9

Well, no, because I don’t know of any matter that

has arisen that would have given the Court an opportunity, sir,

SO

to have decided this.

There is, however, a great distinction

11

involving judicial standards, sir.
On the question of judging an election and seating, of

12

13

course, the House exercises judicial power there, but this

14

Court has been very clear in a number of cases in saying that

15

when the House or Senate are exercising their powers in expul­

16

sion, this is a judicial power of the highest order requiring

17

the greatest amount of due process protection in the adversary

e8

19
20
21

22

23
24
25

sense.
So for an additional judicial reason, sir, we believe
that this exclusion could not be treated as expulsion.
Q

That is a different proposition from the one that

Justice Fortas asked you about.
A

Yes.

Of course, as I said, in terms —■ which,

incidentally, we contend here, that the House did not have the
power, and beyond that, the manner in which Congressman Powell
IS

I

was excluded violates other provisions of the Constitution, to

Certainly the House has power to deal with a Member-

6

of society insofar as a bill of attainder is concerned»

7

is judicial power there to seat and to remove one who has been

8

seated.

9

was legislated, as it was here, after a legislative finding

There

However, where one was never seated, and punishment

10

that at no time was there any semblance of due process hearing

11

held, we contend then that the manner in which this was accom­

12

plished in the House violates first the due process, but sub­

13

stantively and procedural requirements, and .in addition that

14

it amounts to a bill of attainder.

At the beginning of this matter in the 90th Congress,

when Congressman Powell was asked to step aside, the Hays com­
mittee had concluded its report.

The Hays committee, the Com­

mittee on Administration, had been directed by a resolution
which is in the Hays report at page 4, had been directed by the
resolution to investigate the various committees of the House
and the various Members of the House in two regards.

There was

nothing in this resolution which specifies any particular com­
mittee, any particular committee chairman, or any particular me
Member of the House.

Nevertheless, the committee proceeded to

investigate only one.

1

Congressman Powell was invited to attend the Hays com” .

2

raittee, which he declined* at page 84* the letter in the same

3

report is included* in which he was not an unconditional

4

declination but in which he suggested that the committee had a j

5

charge to investigate other committees and other people in Con-

6

gross and as soon as the committee had done this* he would be

7

glad to appear®

that he was entitled to know whether or not this was preferen­

•10

tial treatment ass to him* in order to lay* or predicate if

11

necessary in the House or in the Courts if the matter had been

12

raised.

13

Select Committee was formed and directed to investigate and to

14

report back on the seating of the Congressman* the Select Com­

15

mittee declined to have an adversary hearing.

He was denied this opportunity* and then when this

is Chairman CeXler5s position and the position of the committee

that this was not an adversary hearing.

accorded the rights of an adversary hearing and* therefore* the

20

findings are mere legislative findings and I think the effect

21

of such findings are clearly illustrated by the January 3rd

22

proceeding in the House in 1969 where even though these facts

23

are not refuted anywhere* because we did not have an adversary

24

hearing* they have been completely repudiated.

Mr. Hays made that statement himself in the record on January

So the first predicate of the House's action, the Hays

10

drawn from the House's position.

11

In addition, the House purported to have punished Con­

12

gressman Powell for his contumacious conduct toward the Select

Committee, and that contumacious conduct was a refusal to par­

in terms of such a proceeding and defense to that, the conduct

of other Members of the House would be highly relevant, and

16

this is on© of the reasons, I am sure, that the House did not

want to afford him a due process hearing, because they did not

want any comparative study made, and this is indicated also by

Beyond the constitutional infirmities of due process
and bill of attainder which clearly, going back to the main

10

brunt of our argument, would indicate that this Court had juris-

u

diction and that the issues were justiciable, I want to say a

12

word about mootness and remedy.

13

The House has suggested that the seating of Congressman

14

Powell on January 3, 1969 has mooted this controversy, to which

15

we take issue in

memorandum in opposition and which we con­

tinue now to argue that the matter has not become moot (1) be­
cause this is continuous conduct, the kind of continuous con­
duct that we had complained about in the original suit, and on
January 3, 1969, ’when the motion which finally passed, the
motion which finally passed seating him, carried the findings
from the 90th Congress, there was no question that there was
the same conduct, the same activity was the basis of the dis­
criminatory action which took place on January 3, 1969.
In addition, we take the further position that the
House could not moot this case by further unconstitutional

But in addition, this resolution which

Now the position of the respondents is that this further

13

illegal conduct moots this controversy, to which we take excep­

19

tion and press before you that this matter is not moot, ready

10

for the decision, and should be decided in order* to cover the
.

11

matter of back pay, as well as the other punishment provisions I

12

of the resolution.

13

Now, as to remedy, of course, the big stumbling block

14

in this case all along has been the remedy aspect, and whether

the Court could enforce its mandate.

Congressman has been seated, however, removes this difficulty

22

23

while the matter was pending here.

any notion of mootness is the validity of this action.

cannot be anticipated that the House would not. obey the declara­

2

tion of law by this Court as it has from Marbury through Cooper

3

and Aarons, arid that there is no inhibition to the kind of

4

remedy we seek here coming out of the Constitution itself.

5

There is no basis for believing that the historical role of

S

this Court in the area of judicial review has been that it had

judgment, that in the separation of powers what had been

separated and. given to the Judiciary was the matter of deciding

cases,

10

Do I understand you then that your position now is

that all you seek is a declaratory judgment?

13

Q

A

No,-sir; we argue that we are entitled to declara­

tory judgment, injunctive relief,

and we press for mandamus,

Q

What injunctive relief are you asking for?

15

A

Well, mandatory relief, air, in the sense of the

16

only disability to the paying of the back pay of $55,000 is, of

course, a resolution of the House which has directed, in effect,

that he not be paid because he was not seated,

Is that a separate resolution?

unconstitutionality of 278.

13

17

Well, that sounds to me as if you would, be content

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
There are at least four undisputed matters before us
to which my two friends have paid scant attention.
First, as this Court is fully aware, this is an action

21

against the Members of the House questioning their action in

22

their official capacity.

23

below, here we are suing the Legislative Branch.

24
25

As petitioners emphatically announced
This action,

then, is not an action against private parties or against the
United States, with its consent, to secure the declaration of
26

unconstitutional!ty of a statute passed by the Congress.

It is

directed solely to the Members in their capacity as Members of
the House, and three of their agents elected within the House
pursuant to the command of the House.
It is our view that this Court does not have the power
to entertain this action against the Members any more than it
would have the power to order the Members to pass or repeal a
statute.
Second, there is no dispute now as to the correctness
of the findings made by the Select Committee of the 90th Con­
gress to the effect that Mr. Powell misappropriated large sums
of Governments funds? that he was in civil and criminal contempt
at the time of the action of the New York courts; that he main­
tained unlawfully an improper person on his Congressional pay­
roll; and that he refused to cooperate in a perfectly proper
investigation of his conduct conducted by two committees, one
of the 89th Congress and one of the 90th.
Now, the serious charges against Mr. Powell were not
denied by him at any time.

They were not denied by him before

the committees which investigated him.

They were not denied by

him at the time the House convened, considered the matter and
reached its decision.

They ware not denied by him in the com­

plaint which was filed two years ago.

They were not denied by j

him in the courts below, and they are not denied hers.
Q

Judge Bromley, it is a fact that the Speaker of
27

j

1

the House had already ruled that those questions were not rele-J

2

vant to the investigation of the committee?

3

A

No, Your Honor % it is not»

4

Q

I thought that counsel said that prior to this

5

there was a ruling by the Speaker of the House that the inquiry

6

into his conduct while he was in the Congress , on this particu­

7

lar investigation, was not relevant.

B

A

No, that is not right, sir.

9

Q

Well, then, I misunderstood, probably.

10

A

No, I don’t think so.

11

probably, but if they did, it is not correct.
Q

12

13

1 think they said that,

Well, don't let me interrupt your argument any

more, then.
A

14

Third, the complaint in this case does not allege

15

that Mr. Powell was excluded because of his race and the record

16

before the House, when it came to reach its decision of expul­

17

sion, does not even suggest that such an allegation would be

18

supportable.

19

case.

20

Accordingly, i say it has no proper place in this

Fourthly, the action of the House of the 91st Congress,

21

the present Congress, in fining Mr. Powell $25,000 and depriv­

22

ing him of his seniority likewise is not before this Court.

23
24
25

The action of the 91st House is not challenged in the complaint,
The parties to any such claim, that is, the Members of the
present Congress, and their agents, are not parties to this
28

1

action in their capacity as Members of this Congress. Moreover,

2

this Court, I submit, does not have original jurisdiction to

3

hear any such claim.

j

So the precise question, as we see it, is whether any

j

5

court, in a suit against the Members of the House of the 90th

j

6

Congress, can review a decision of those Members, acting pur­

7

suant to their constitutional powers, to judge the qualificatioi s

8

of their own Members, to exclude a member-elect solely for rea­

9

sons of personal misconduct, and that is all Mr. Powell was

4

10

excluded for here.

10

Now, I submit that there are at least five separate

11

reasons why his demands for relief cannot be granted, and X

12

would like to summarise them briefly before I start to discuss

13

them.

14

In the first place, although we haven’t heard any men-

15

tion of it, Article I, Section 5, the speech or debate clause,

16

affirmatively bars any court from questioning Members of the

17

House, or their agents, with respect to actions taken by them

18

within the House, such as the exercise of their constitutional

19

power to judge the qualifications of one of their Members.

2.0

2?

Second, I don’t think Federal Courts have any subject
matter jurisdiction he@ef because Article X, Section 5, assigns
»

22

the sole adjudicatory power to the House by declaring that the

23

House is the judge, of the qualifications of its Members.

24

delegation of judicial power under Article I, like the power to

25

try impeachments, if you please, is an explicit exception to
33

That

general grant of judicial power to the courts under Article III.
Since the Legislative is co-equal with the Judicial
branch, the judgments which the House makes in this situation

j
f

in the field allocated to it, i0e8? the qualification of its
Members, are exclusive and supreme„
j

Thirdly, the Court should not proceed in this case be­
cause it involves a nonjusticiable political question.
Fourthly, if the Courts could review the propriety of
what the House did, it is clear that the House acted within its
constitutional powers when it excluded Mr, Powell, for the
constitutional power of each House to judge qualifications is
not limited, as has been stated so many times here, to the
three standing disqualifications of age, citisenship, and inhabi
tancy.

It extends, as well, to matters of personal misconduct

unbefitting a Member of the House, and even if these three
standing disqualifications were exclusive, the House’s action
in any event would be justified under its exp

sion power since

the two-thirds vote required for expulsion was obtained.
Fifthly, assuming that the lower Federal Courts did
have the power to rule on the merits of the case, under the
circumstances presented. here, those courts did not abuse their I
discretion in declining to grant the extraordinary and dis­
cretionary relief prayed for.
Now, I submit that any one of these five reasons is
sufficient to require dismissal of the action.

?

Gould I ask you a question about your nonjusticia­

bility argument?
To put an extreme case, do you find that if the Congress

Well, I don’t understand.

action didn’t take place within the House.

6

Members, the power to make its own rules, of its proceedings,

9

Judge Bromley, would your argument carry you to

the extent of saying that if one party was in complete control

11

of the House — say it had two-thirds or three-fourths of all

12

the Members of the House — and that it could, on a proceeding

13

of this kind, refuse to seat ail the elected Members of the

14

other party on the ground that their views were dangerous to

15

the country, or for any reason that it wanted to, would you

16

say that they could do that without any remedy whatsoever?

What vrould the remedy be?

It would reside in this Court, in spite of the

Q

Suppose they did it one by one, just one by one»

They take a Mr» Powell today and a Mr» Smith and a Mr. Jones
the next day, and did it one by one.
A

Where would the remedy lie?

Well, it is a harder case, but that might in the

first place —
36

Q
2

No, it isn’t a harder case if we have no juris­

diction whatsoever,
A

3

Welly I think it is, because of your remark about

4

other perversions in Bond against Floyd,

I must admit there

5

are some perversions which this Court must be ingenious enough

6

to find a way around the speech or debate clause, or else we

7

will be confronted with revolution or worse.
So I don't say that an utter perversion, which this

8
9

may be, and lastly, this may be an attempt by Congress to add

10

another standing disqueilification which it has no power to do

11

and which I don’t think could be attacked if it tried to do it

Well, a great many things.

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF BRUCE BROMLEY, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

7
Q
9

MR. BROMLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice,, may it please the

Court:
I recognise that it has a strange sound coming from any

10

lawyer to tell this Court that something unconstitutional may

11

have occurred, and yet you have no power to intervene, but I

12

make that contention in this posture and I rest it squarely on

13

the speech or debate clause as interpreted by at least three

14

cases decided here under that clause.

15

That clause, providing that for any speech or debate in

16

the House, its Members shall not be questioned in any place,

17

underscores and enforces the separation of powers doctrine em­

18

bedded in our Constitution.

19

of protecting the integrity of independence of the Federal Legis­

20

lative Branch from any interference whatsoever by the Executive

21

or Judicial Branches, even to the extent of imposing upon the

It has the broad purpose, I submit,

i

^

22

Members the inconvenience and expense of defending themselves.

23

No longer does anyone question the fact that speech or

24

debate is not limited to words spoken in debate in the House, but

25

includes everything done in the House in connection with its
39

1

business, such as. the act of voting , the passage of a resolu­

2

tion, directing the activities of its agents.

3
4

5

Q

If you follow that to its logical conclusion, why

doesn't that vitiate the. whole power of judicial review?
A

Because it is confined only, Your Honor, to the

6

actions which the Members take in connection with the regulation

7

of their own proceedings within the House.

8

Q

Their own business.

9

A

And mind you, that is why I emphasised at the out­

10

set, in a suit against the Members, it doesn’t vitiate the broad

11

area at all, sir.

12

It only vitiates a very narrow area.

Now, the three cases that I mentioned.

This immunity

1.3

from attack put up by the speech or debate clause covers —

14

well, let's take Kilbourne against Thompson first.

15

volved the passage of a resolution directing the illegal and

16

unconstitutional incarceration in prison of a private indivi­

17

dual, a suit against the Members barred by speech or debate,

10

even though their action was clearly unconstitutional.

'19

That in­

The alleged unlawful and unconstitutional activity of

20

seizing private property in the context of an effort to suppress

21

free speech, last term's Dombrowski against Eastland.

22
23
24
25

Finally, activity which results in the clear violation
of a criminal statute, United States against Johnson.
Now, the only possible limitation, as I said before, on
!
the speech or debate clause is what this Court said in Kilbourne
40

1

and what it described as “possible utter perversions „55 and the

2

example that I gave of beheading the President was given by this
;

3

Court in the opinion in Kilbourne as an, example of an utter per­

4

version.

I didn’t make it up.
i

What other cases would be included in this doctrine of

5

6

utter perversior»?

That is a very difficult question but I am

7

willing to say, I think, for what it is worth, that probably

8

if all blacks were excluded in any fashion, either seriatim or

9

by the passage of a rule, that would be an utter perversion pos­

10

sibly.

I am sure if all Republicans were excluded, it would

11

clearly be an utter perversion.
But I say probably not if only one black were excluded,

12

'

13

such as here, assuming, contrary to the fact, that Mr. Powell

14

was excluded because of his race.
Q

15
IS

How about ten# Judge Bromley?

Suppose ten blacks

were excluded?

17

A

Well, ten at one time?

18

Q

You take it your way.

19

A

I will take it my way.

Well, ten at one time, and

20

if there were only ten in the House, 1 can’t tell you.

21

kn6w.

22
23
24
25

I don’t

Maybe we could get soma help if we took the analogy of
impeachment.

Suppose the President were impeached on unconsti­

tutional grounds of race, religion, or speech, and removed from
office by the Senate.

I say this Court could do nothing about

41

!

it in a suit against Members of the Senate because of the speech

2

or debate clause» and the fact, in addition —
Q

3
4

That would be because of the impeachment clause

rather than the speech and debate.
A

5

1 was about to say, and because I think, as well,

6

the fact that the Constitution lodges the ultimate power to try

7

impeachments in the Senate under Article I, just as the Consti­

8

tution allocates the power to judge the qualifications in the

9

House.

10
11

Q

But the Constitution does state what the quali-

fications are, doesn't it?

12

A

Oh,

no, sir.

13

Q

I thought it did.

14

A

No, sir.

It states three or more standing dis­

15

qualifications that affect a class.

16

sentative who has not attained the age of 25 and is a resident

17

citizen of the State from which he comes.

18
19

No person shall be a Repre­

Now, I think that is

a standing disqualification and doesn't at all evidence an in­
tent on the part of the framers to overrule the long-standing

20

power of legislative bodies for over two centures to discipline

21

their own members for personal misconduct.

22

the Sixteenth Century.

23
24
25

Q

That goes back to

What you are really saying. Judge Bromley, if I

correctly understand you, is that the Constitution has these
grounds of disqualification.

The Constitution provides that the

42

1

House shall be the judge of the qualifications of its Members?

2

that the House may take whatever standard it wants to as a .

3

necessary qualification of a Member, provided that it is not so

4

extremely outrageous»

Is that about it?

5

A

That is a fair statement? yes.

6

Q

That is your position.

7

A

So long as we qualify it by understanding that my

3

contention about the power to exclude is probably limited to
■

9

10

u

cases of misconduct unbefitting the trust and confidence that
ought to be placed in a Member.
Q

Well, that is a different matter, because if you

12

are going to narrow it down to qualifications unbefitting a

13

Member, unbefitting a Member —

14

A

Conduct.

15

Q

Well, now, is that something for the House to de­

16
17
18

IS
20
21

22
23
24
25

cide, whether the particular basis for exclusion is an appro­
priate basis within that standard, or is that subject to judi­
cial review?
A
Q

Something for the House and the House alone.
Well, then you get back to my statement of it

rather than your qualification of it, don't you?
A

You well may.

I am not sure I quite understand it,

but my position is —
Q

What I mean to say is that if I correctly under­

stand your last statement, you are saying that the House may
43

1

adopt,Its o>wn standards as to what are requisite qualifications

2

of Members, subject to only one limitation, and that is this

3

perversion, or whatever the correct words are0

4
5

A

Adopt its own standards?

Is that right?

They can31 adopt any

additional standing disqualifications.

6

Q

I am trying to understand your position.

7

A

I know it is difficult.

8

Q

It is? yes, it is* Judge.

9

Q

Judge, suppose we had the situation they had in

10

New York after World War I, the case in which Chief Justice

n

Hughes, then out of office, interceded for five men who were

12

denied admission to the New York Legislature just because they

13

were Socialists.

14

Congress today under your argument.

15

for that?

16

A

Under speech or debate, I do not believe so? no,

10

Q

Under speech'or debate.

19

A

Yes, sir.

17

Now, suppose that same thing happened in the
Would there be any remedy

sir.

I must repeat, even though I know it

2,0

may bore you, these questions have nothing to do with our case.

21

There was nothing unconstitutional about Mr. Powell's exclusion

22

once you agree that the power to judge the qualifications for

23

misconduct is lodged in the House, as I think is perfectly clear

24
25

by the practice of all the legislatures and of our Congress
right down to the present time.
44

1

Q

I am going to ask you one more question.

In that

2

respect, would you make any distinction between the grounds for

3

exclusion which relate to his activities as a Member of the

j 4

House,, that is to say, the alleged misappropriation of funds,

5

the alleged contumacious conduct, the alleged improper payroll

6

practice --- would you make a distinction between those on the

7

one hand, and on the other hand, alleged improper conduct that

8

had no bearing upon the, business of the House that related

9

allegedly to Mr, Powell’s character and his obedience to law,

tG

11

namely, the contumacious conduct toward a court?
A

I would make no such distinction, sir, and there'

12

are many, many cases of the legislative practice of excluding

13

felons, perjurers, wb even have some precedents for persons who

14

have been contemptuous of courts outside the House,

15

I think there is a well defined legislative common law

16

that came along with this speech or debate clause into the

17

Constitution.

13

1 was talking about impeachment, and I said that I

19

thought that was an analogy because the speech or debate clause

20

applied to impeachment even though it was on an utterly uncon­

21

stitutional ground,

22

■

Mow, coming to this contention of the petitioners for

23

a moment, as I understand them, they say, "Well, speech or de­

24

bate may bar the imposition of criminal or civil penalties after

25

the event, but it doesn’t forbid the coercive kind of relief
45

1

inherent in an injunction or a writ

2

However, it seems to us that in order to effectuate the immunity

,

or a declaratory judgment."

3

afforded by the speech or debate clause, it must apply to in-

4

junction, mandamus, or declaratory judgment, because it is far

S

simpler to intimidate critical legislators by direct order of

6

a court with its attendant sanctions than it is by the indirect

7

threat of subsequent criminal or civil proceedings.

8

9

As I have indicated, I don't believe petitioners have
overcome their difficulty by now limiting their prayer to a

10

declaratory judgment, because a declaratory judgment is itself,

1?

1 submit, in the most direct and positive sense, a questioning

12

of speech or debate taken in the House.

13

Furthermore, in this situation, I think there should be

14

a doctrine, and probably is, that declaratory relief should not

IS

lie where the suit for injunction is barred at least by the

16

separation of powers doctrine, as it is here, for unless declara­

17

tory judgment is to be a wholly gratuitous and advisory and use­

IQ

less act, it must rely for its efficacy upon the willingness of

19

the Members to acquiesce in the court’s interpretation of the

20

House * s powers.

21

Thus, insofar as a declaratory judgment would be given

22

force and effect by the Members’ voluntary acquiescence, it

23

would be, I submit, as effective an impingement and interference

24

with legislative proceedings as a flat injunction would be.

25

I want to say a word about the non-Member agents, because
4S

i

in Dombrowski against Eastland the court said that the immunity !

15

tions and the power to expel. Let's assumfe for a moment, con­

1Q

trary to my basic position, that this Court may properly review

17

the action of the

House in this case.

18

the action of the

House in doing what it did to Mr» Powell was

19

clearly within its constitutional powers, for it clearly was

20

within the constitutional grant, in my view, of the power to

2'i

judge his qualifications to sit.

22

I nevertheless say that

There is no use in my repeating that I do not believe

11

cause of the obligation they owed to the whole Nation to have a

legislative body made up of at least decent, honorable citizens.

13
14
15
16

Q

How are the qualifications fixed, if not by the

Constitution?
A

They are fixed,

sir,

by the undoubted practice of

all legislatures to control their own disciplinary matters and

17

by the doctrine that the legislatures have power over their

18

internal affairs.

19

Q

20
21

That is to say that they can fix any qualifications

they want?
A

Oh, .no»

to the Congress?

that I have mentioned»

In addition, there are a couple more,

a person who can9fc take the oath of loyalty, and a person who

holds a Federal office»

A

He complied with all of those; yes.

of Congressman?
A

12

There are not any expressed in the Constitution

13

except as is resident in the phrase 5ito judge the qualifications , *'

14

which has a meaning that his personal conduct is a qualifica­

15

tion.

16

Q

Well, Judge, does that mean that you contend that

37

Congress,

by the Constitution, is given the right to determine

13

what the qualifications for Congressmen are, as wall as to

that I really don’t see how anybody can question it.

I don't think your cases have ever had occasion to

15

of South Carolina, excluded from the 41st Congress by a vote

16

for selling appointments to the Military and Naval Academies.

17

Now, it doesn't say whether he did that while he was in the

13

Congress, at least this summary doesn't, or before he got there,

19

but it doesn't make any difference.

20

Q

It would make a difference, wouldn't it?

21

A

Not a biti not a bit.

Q

Why?

A

Because if he is guilty of prior misconduct, he is

impropriety while he was acting.

Well, the House itself formally never thought it

was acting on an expulsion matter.

it as an exclusion matter.

Should the

Let’s assume that in the precedents of t'he House

it was pretty clear the House had always thought it could never

10

expel for conduct occurring prior to the organising of the

I suppose that would be of some bearing.

Yes, but couldn’t they clearly distinguish Mr.

Q

Where does it say in this record, Judge Bromley,

that he had $50,000?
A

Well, I upped it a little.

The specific findings

of the report say that he willfully and unlawfully appropriated
to his own use —• there are two findings, $25,GOO-odd, $50,000,

$16,000-odd, and you add them up and they come to aver $44,000., j

I thought you said that in March, in January of

country, didn't get it back, in addition to which, there were

11

many other improper expenditures.

Mr. Bromley, it sounds to me like, from what you

say, they charged hira with the crime of embezzlement.

They found that he misappropriated, their finding

I suppose that is a crime.
Q

When it fro longed lb© the United States .

Yes, I suppose that is a crime.

It might be embezzlement; yes, sir.

Were they punishing him for that, or what were

■ ,

He wasn't fined in the 90th Congress.

He was

fined in the present Congress, which is not before Your Honors.
But what were they doing?

They were exercising their consti­

tutional power to punish him.

55
V*

Q

To punish him.

A

That is what the Constitution says.

3

Q

That is for a crime.

4

A

Well, no.

Q

Well, suppose they had indicted him.

It just says to punish him.
Could they

have done that?

7

A

No , they could not have,

8

Q

Why not?

9

A

The House indict him?

10

Q

Why couldn't they?

11

A

They could send him to a Grand Jury, I assume.

12

Q

But it seems to me like- what they have done is

13

try him for a criminal offense, thereby denying him the oppor­

14

tunity to be tried before a judge and a jury.

I should think in this posture that we ought to

come here with some statement from him, if he didn't do it,
saying "I didn't do it," but they are very careful not to say
that and they have never said it.

Isn’t that a crime?

That is what I was thinking.

That would probably

A

Yes.

Well, I don’t know that it would have been

20

any better place to try it, Mr» Justice Black., Sine® he plainly

But the matter of whether he is civilly liable is still
pending somewhere in the Department»

4

So finally, I say again that for any one of these six

5

legal reasons, I think this matter deserves affirmance, and I

6

believe it to be no answer to any of these arguments to say that

7

the House might unreasonably or erroneously exercise its adjudi­

8

catory powers, for Members of the House, like Judges, take an

9

oath to support the Constitution»

We can't assume that they

10

will violate the oath»

Of course, there is always the risk of

11

error, even constitutional error, on the part of each branch of ;

12

Government in the areas in which it is granted supreme consti­

13

tutional competence.

14

But this is not a weakness of our system of government.

15

I think it is a strength, because some individual or some group

16

always has to make the final decision and our founding fathers

17

put this narrow area of adjudication not in the hands of an

18

Article III court, but in the hands of an Article I legislative

19

body.

20
21

22
23
24
25

There is a remedy for a situation like this, of course,
but it is a political remedy, so quickly exercised by the voters
in this case, and if he, Mr» Powell, had presented himself a
raonth or two after he was excluded, since he was overwhelmingly
re-elected, in the light of the Speaker's ruling that the House
would reconsider the matter in the light of that important
58

1

development, he probably would have been seated»

2

He chose to wait»

3

Q

I don't know why,

Why would he have been seated , if he had so

4

recently been prevented from taking his office because of these

5

what you call crimes?

6

A

Because the voters so overwhelmingly expressed

7

their preference to him that his opponents practically got no

8

votes, despite all the publicity attendant upon his derelictions

9

and, of course, the House would consider that» That was a very

10

important matter»

11

voted to seat him, sure, but they thought "Look, we can't let

12

this man go scot-free»

13

him of his seniority and fine him $25,000, which he has got to

14

pay $1,100 a month out of his salary»

15

Q

When they did consider it last January, they

We will punish him," and they did strip

Well, there is quite a difference between those

16

two, isn't there, quite a difference between taking away his

17

seniority, which I presume nobody would decline to say the

18

Congress didn't have a right to do, and fining him for a crime»

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

A

I don't see the difference, sir, fining him for

misappropriating money, making him pay it back in part»

I thin):

it was a very mild sanction, myself,
Q

Is there any power to commit him to prison, as

the expel clause in the Constitution?
A

For disorderly behavior.

They have the power to

punish a Member for disorderly behavior.
59

Q

That is what it says,

I assume that means they can have him imprisoned,

Mr, Kinoy?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR KINOY, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

13
14

Neither

MR, KINOY:

May it please the Court, there have been

some rather unusual statements made in Court this morning which
v/© would like to respond to very briefly.
In the first place, in response to the Chief Justice’s
question as to the Speaker’s ruling, I call the Court’s atten­

19

tion to the fact that in the Congressional Record for January

20

3rd, H-14, . th© Speaker’s ruling is set forth in full.

21

22
23

24
25

The

Speaker ruled that the question as to the punishment of Mr,
Powell for acts committed in the 88th or 89th Congress is not
germane to the proposition that he now be sworn in.

The Speaker

based his ruling, Mr. Justice White, upon precedents of the
Mouse, and contrary to what Judge Bromley has said, the
60

1

precedents of the House are full and clear on this question,

2

and they start with the case which is most famous American

3
4

history, the case of Matthew Lyons in the 5th Congress, in which
'
Congressman Lyons was convicted under the Alien Sedition Act

5

and a motion was made to expel him before the House»
j

6

Th® House, then composed of gentlemen who had partici- .

7

pated in the framing of the Constitution, thoroughly debated the

8

issue and came to the conclusion that the House had no consti- J

9

tutional power whatsoever to expel — and mind you, this is

io

under the expulsion clause, not the exclusion clause — no con-

n

stitutional power to expel a Member for alleged acts occurring

12

prior to his election.»

S3

point out that the fundamental reason was the very same reason j

14

which Madison and Hamilton advanced, and that is that the

15

ultimate tribunal as to the fitness of a Member is not the

16

Congress of the United States, but the tribunal as to the fitness

17
18
19

And in full, the annals of Congress

of a Member is his constituency, the people of th® United States,

The precedent of the Matthew Lyons case has been fol­

lowed fully and completely, never deviated once in the five

cases on expulsion in the history of the House, and for the

t

convenience of the Court, we have set them out in full in our
reply brief, pages 18 through 23»
Just so there will be no question about that whatsoever;,
the official historian of the House, Mr» Galloway, said, in his

Mow I would like to address myself to the nest question.
I would like to address myself now to the question advanced that;
this Court has no power under the speech or debate clause»

I

find that argument rather surprising in light of the decisions
of this Court iself»
This Court has held from the beginning that the speech
or debate clause, and this I recall discussing fully with the
Court in the Eastland case last term, has held that the clause
was designed to protect legislators in legitimate legislative
business from criminal or civil sanctions»

There are no crimi~j

nal or civil sanctions involved in this case»

Bat more fundamentally, in Kilhourne against Thompson,

which is the fountainhead of all teaching of this Court on the

speech or debate clause —

Mr. Kinoy, let me get something straight here.

the Speaker of the House in 1967 — was that when the exclusion I

6

took place?

7
3
9
10
11
12

I

A

Yes.

He made a ruling there, too, Mr. Justice

White, and 1 will make that very clear.
The ruling in March of 1967 was that the matter before
the House was an exclusion and not an expulsion.
Q

I understand that, but did he at that time refer

to anything at all about expulsion, except to say it wasn’t one!

13

A

Except the two-thirds vote.

14

Q

It was only in '69 that he referred to the prece­

15

That is right.

dents of the House on expulsion.

16

A

Correct, Justice White? that is absolutely correcte

17

Nov?, in Kilbourne itself,

.the Court held that the

18

resolution of the House of Representatives then before the

YJ

Court was unconstitutional and void and held it directly, and

zy

the relief that flowed from that was the relief which was

21

directed toward the Sergeant-at-Arms of.the House.

22

So in the very case which the respondents rely on,

23

which supposedly deprives this Court of its historic power of

24

judicial review over actions of the Legislature when those

25

actions transcend constitutional boundaries, in that very case
63

1

this Court did precisely what we are asking the Court to do

2

here , and that is declare a resolution of the House of Repre­

*r>

sentatives unconstitutional.

.‘
J

This was no minor question» This reflected the under­

4
5

standing of the Court that the speech or debate clause does not

6

repeal Marbury/Madison»

7

to the Chief Justice whan that decision was handed down.

8

speech or debate clause simply has nothing todo with this case

9

whatsoever, nothing whatsoever.

The speech or debate clause was known
The

10

Q

Which case was that?

11

A

Kilbourne against Thompson, Mr. Justice Black,

12

Kilbourne against Thompson, the original discussion of the

13

speech or debate clause in this Court.
Q

14

Is that the one that stated that in considering

IS

these conditions of the Constitution, the power that could be

16

exercised to do something to a man was the least possible power

17

adequate to the end proposed?
A

18
19

That is right.

That is precisely the case that

stated that.
I respectfully would bring this to the attention of the

20
21

Courts

22

have presented here today has one fundamental flaw in it.

23

fundamental flaw is that it is simply not the analysis of

24

Hamilton and Madison.

25

The analysis of the Constitution which the respondents
The

It is simply not the analysis of the

foundaig fathers, and what I find extraordinary in the height
64

!

is that the proposition is urged before this Court that the

2

legislative power which the British Parliament asserted in the

3

Wilkes case, one of the most central and decisive causes of our

4

revolution, that this power is the power which the respondents

5

seek to sustain their action upon» I never would have expected

6

that the Wilkes case would once again be argued in an American

7

court»
Now I have to say one thing;

8

9

I think it is outrageous

that before this Court assertions are made that the petitioner

10

was guilty of certain acts, that the petitioner never denied

11

his guilt of certain acts.

12

dence of that in it, and I want to make it very clear.
We did not boycott those hearings.

13
14
15

16

17
18
19
20

21

22
23
24
25

The record hasn't an ounce of evi­

there.

Mr. Bromley was not

We were there, and the petitioner was there, and we

asserted our constitutional position, which we had every right
to assert before that House.
More than that, 1 think it is not proper that the
respondents make 'the statements they do about petitioner when
the Chairman of the committee itself, Mr. Hays, on January 3rd
of this year, said that the findings of his committee were not
judicially ascertained and that he was satisfied that no infer­
ence could be drawn from those because a Federal Grand Jury had
not seen fit to indict the petitioner.

1 think it is improper

to make the statements about petitioner which were made.
Q

You said that he made his position clear before the
65

1

committee?

a

h

Yes, Mr» -Justice Blade»
’

3

Q

What did he say?

4

A

We said, before the committee, that the Congress ha3

6

1die constitutional qualifications as set forth in the Constitu­

7

tion.

We said that the House had no power under the Constitu­

12

tion to go beyond that question, and that wa3 the position we

13

took before the Select Committee.

14

Q

Did he answer all questions asked?

15

A

All questions on the constitutional qualifications?

16

17

yes. Your Honor.
Q

Z£ the petitioner had been seated, there is no

18

doubt, is there, that the House would have had power to punish

19

him if it had concluded so to do under the specific provision

20

in the Constitution.

tional power is clear.
66

But in theory, that constitu­

1

A

Yes* Your Honor»

c.

Q

So that if a proceeding to punish him had been

3

brought in the, same session of Congress in which allegedly these

4

acts were committed — I am talking about the acts relating to

5

Congressional funds — there would have been no question as to

6

the power of the Rouse to punish,, subject to judicial review,

7

or not subject to judicial review, as it might turn out.

8

that right?

9

A

That is right»

Is

Subject to an adversary proceeding

10

and the rights of an adversary proceeding, and subject to the

11

limitations-as X said before, of the Constitution.

12

Q

And. also there would be no question as to the power

13

of the House in an appropriate case and by whatever procedure

14

may be appropriate, to expel a Member, is there?

15

A

That is absolutely right.

16

Q

So to a considerable extent, anyway, your submis­

17

sion to us depends, in the first instance, upon the distinction

10

between the exclusion and the expulsion procedures, or the

19

exclusion and the punishment procedures.

20

A

I would put it this way. Your Honor?

Fundamentaliy

21

the constitutional argument, the constitutional position, is

22

the same.

23

what the House cannot do under the exclusion power, that is, to

24

add a qualification to membership, that would equally fall as

25

unconstitutional.

If the expulsion power were used, in effect, to do

67

i

Q

Oh.

What you are saying is that the House can

2

expel only because of the lack of these three specific quali­

3

fications?

I have read your brief on the point» but perhaps

you would tell me briefly and quickly now why you say that you

10

have to take this problem session by session of the Congress»

11

or Congress by Congress.

12

Congress cannot punish or expel for acts — let's say disorderly

13

behavior — occurring in the preceding Congress by the same

14

Member.

That is to say, your position is that

15

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

16

Q

Why is that?

17

A

Well, the explanation for that, I think, was best

18

put forward, the first time it was ever discussed in the House,

19

in the Matthew Lyons case.

20

to the fundamental principles of representative government be­

21

cause the founders were determined that under no guise whatso­

22

ever the House was to have the power of overruling the choice ox

23
24
25

The explanation was that this went

the people as to who was to be their representative.
Mow, as to unfitness or prior misbehavior, the House
specifically discussed this in the Lyons case, because there
68

1

they said it was the grossest misbehavior.

2.

among other things, spitting at other Members of the House of

3

Representatives, Matthew Lyons was.

4

it is a fundamental principle of American representative govern­

5

ment that the court of last resort as to the fitness of a Member

6

is his constituency. When an act has occurred prior, to the elec­

1

tion, the people have passed on it by electing him and the House

3

may not overrule.

20

21

He was charged with,

The House there said that

Q

And the fact is, that.in this gase' you would say

12

that Representative Powell could not have been expelled for the

23

conduct that is involved in this case,

14

A

I would say that? yes, sir,

15

Q

Because of the time of its occurrence,

26

A

That is right,

X think the constitutional pro­

17

visions are very clear, and the precedents of the House are

18

very clear on that.

29

Finally, I would like to just point out to the Court

20

that in essence, the respondents' position is a challenge to the

21

role of this Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitu­

22
23
24
25

tion; that the short answer to the respondents' entire argument
can be put no better than Chief Justice Marshall put it in
Marbury against Madison, that it is for the Judiciary to say
what is the law, and that is the meaning of the written
