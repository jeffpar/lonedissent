ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. URDAN:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
This is a review of a decree of the Court of

10
11

Appeals for the 7th Circuit.

The Court of Appeals upheld

12

in order of the Labor Board which had dismissed unfair labor

13

practice charges against the labor union.
The case .raises the issue of "whether it is

14

an unfair

IS

labor practice under Section 8(b)(1)(A) the National Labor

13

Relations Act, when labor union fines one of its members for

17

exceeding a production quota, so-called ceiling, as set by the

18

union.

19

Petitioners are employees of the Wisconsin Motor

go

Corporation in Milwaukee.

The subject of the ceilings was

n

bargained from time to time.

iz

Q

But was the actual ceiling agreed upon?

23

A

They were not agreed upon in the sense that
'

employer had to pay him under the collective agreement«

2

There was collective bargaining over the ceiling

3

as to the general level of the ceiling but never were the

4

ceilings accepted in bargaining-' as a limit on the individual

S

and it is the individual who is complaining here.

6

Q

What seems to me to be the difficulty in the

7

briefs of this argument and that is the apparent disagreement

Q

between the parties as to what the facts are.

9

as No. 1 of the questions presented, referring to the ceiling,

You state

10

you talk about production quotas established and enforced by

11

the union.

12

The government tries to persuade us that really

13

these things while not explicitly written out on the collective

14

bargaining agreement nonetheless, were by custom, practice

IS

and basic recognition were part and parcel of the agreement

16

between the union and the employer.

17

different cases.

18

have before us.

19

A

That makes for two quite

I am interested in knowing which case we

I think there is some truth in both positions.

20

From the standpoint of the employees who are complaining here,

21

the case we have is that a collective bargaining agreement

22

was entered into, this union bargained it and agreed with the

23

employer, and the collective bargaining agreement said no

24

limit on the production or on the earnings of these men.

25

They could produce to their capacity, they could
3

claim pay for that work and they would have to

be paid for

that work.
That is the bargain that the union made with the
employer.

Now, it is true that the employer and the union

bargained from time to time about the level of the ceiling
because the employer recognized this as a fact of life in the
plant.

He recognized that the union had these ceilings.

The

employer recognised that it was in his interest to have these
ceilings increased from time to time, and he bargained for
that objective.
He tried to get the ceilings removed, not totally
successfully.

The union tried to get the employer to agree

to the ceiling and they failed in that.

The employer never

agreed to put a ceiling on the earnings of these men.

We

have, in essence, a stand-off in the bargaining.
Neither side got what it wanted.

But as far as the

employees are concerned, they worked under a collective
bargaining agreement that permitted them to exceed the ceiling,
to earn more and to collect their pay, and the employer had to
pay them.

The employer could not refuse to pay them.
This is their complaint •—• that the union bypassed

the collective agreement in the collective bargaining process.
Q

May I see if I understand this?

The collective

bargaining agreement established, or there was established

4

i

pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, certain
ceilings.

Now, any employee who produced above this particular

ceiling was entitled to additional pay? is that correct?
A
ceilings.

The collective bargaining did not establish
The collective bargaining provided pay rates, pay

ranges, and if a man worked

piece work and he produced more

pieces, he would be paid for whatever he produced, and that is
all that is in the collective bargaining agreement.
Q

Is there a flat rate, no

matter how much be

produced, or was there a point at which an incentive pay that
is to say a greater rate of pay was used.
A

Incentive pay started from the beginning but

there were certain guarantees in the contract.
Q

If an employee reaches a certain number of

units, is he entitled to incentive pay beginning with the unit
at that point?
A

The pay is computed on the actual production,

starting with the first unit.
the way through.

The incentive pay follows all

However, a man is guaranteed a certain rate

if his production does not come up to certain minimum standards
In that sense you might say that the incentive rate starts at
this point of guarantee,
Q

That is to say there is a guarantee and I assume

that that guarantee is equal to the per-unit rate times a
certain number of units? is that right?

As I understand it, there is a. ceiling whether it is

13

Is that the

I would say that is not the way it works.

There

15

is not a ceiling in the collective bargaining agreement.

There

17

is an incentive pay plan for the man is paid for. the units that

18

he produces.

19

A

Then you

The union has set a maximum on the pay that they want

20

the man to earn.

21

will gat you up to that pay level using the process of division

22

as you just described it.

23

That is

They say only produce that many., units that’

what the union says the man should do.

24

is the so-called ceiling.

That is not reflected in thr

25

collective bargaining agreement as such.

6

The collective

That

bargaining agreement establishes the rate for the unit,
Q

Is that cei.ling the same as the minimum

guaranteed wage?
A

Mo, it is a higher rate,

Q

It is a higher rate,

A

It exceeds the minimum guaranteed rate.

But there is no ceiling and there is no limit
in the agreement as such.

The agreement says the man is to

work eight hours a day and whatever he produces, he will be
paid for it.
The effect of the ceiling,

looked on very clearly

by the record, is that the man does not work eight hours a day.
If he is any kind of worker at all he finishes his work much
more quickly.

There is no need to abide by the agreement to

work his eight hours,
Q

But you are not suggesting that the union action

is a breach of contract?
A

I think we are very close to this line,

Q

You are not suggesting that an employee, who is

also bound by the contract, who works only enough to earn the
guaranteed minimum and who never attempts to earn any more is
breaching the contract?
A

This could be possible.

This issue is not

contested because the employer has not made an issue of it.
Q

Are you serious?

7

Are you serious that any employee who does not want

1

to earn any more than the minimum is breaching the contract?
A

3

When you say "breaching the contract", I think

we are getting at a concept of what the employer is entitled

to.

Are you willing to put your case on'whether or

not there is a breach of contract?

It is hardly a position to say that your clients

A

Right.

You wouldn't suggest that your people are because

: you are attempting to earn incentive pay, but the employee
who doesn't attempt to earn incentive pay you are suggesting
might be in breach of contract?
A

I am suggesting that --

Q

Would you say that 10 employees all who get-

together and says

"We don't want to earn any incentive pay,

and let's all agree that we won't earn any incentive pay ”
Would you say that that isn't protected by Section 7?
A

An agreement to limit production which is

; negotiated with an employer

and which is incorporated in

{ collective bargaining agreements is protected»
An agreement to limit production which is not
negotiated is not protected and there are numerous cases on
this

general subject.
Q

They are. in our briefs.

Now, I agree with that, but here there has been

negotiated with an employer a scale of pay, depending upon your
effort, and I doubt if an employer could just fire an employee
under the contract who didn't earn any extra peiy.
A

I tend to agree with that.

! here has never raised this issue.

I think the employer

a breach of contract, nor do I consider that this is, in any
way, essential to the case of

The employer pays --

against a member for crossing a picket line and working during
a strike.
The question of v/hether that violated Section 8(b) (1) A) .

In the Marine and Shipbuilding Workers case there was a holding

any possibility that a subsequent decree might raise a question

No decree that could subsequently be entered, would

Now, this is all that the contract established.

doesn't have a provision that my opponent has been referring

to that an employee can be paid for turning out as much as he

pleases or that he has to give over and above the machine rate

Now, by taking -—

Is there an obligation to work an eight-hour

14

that says that the work shift is from a certain hour to a certain

hour and that encompasses ---

Q

So that an employee, when he has earned his

machine rate still must stay on the job
A

He still must stay on the job and the record

-19

shows that they do stay on the job, that the time that is

20

available is spent usually ir preparing the machines for the

21

next day's work, that, although there has been bccasionally

22

some problem with too much talking or card playing or other

23

things of that sort that whenever the company has promulgated

rules to cut that out

It has stopped and that the union

stewards have cooperated in cutting out any of those diversions,

there is nothing in the contract that would

Now, as this Court is well aware, unions have

10

traditionally been opposed to incentive pay systems, not

11

primarily for the featherbedding reasons that my opponent has

indicated, but for the perfectly legitimate reason that they

13
16
17

have feared that this could result in employees working them­
selves out of jobs.
Q

This may be so but they signed the collective

bargaining agreement with the plan in it, didn't they?
A

That is correct.

I am going to come to that

18

in a moment after establishing, which apparently do not have to

19

waiver that you cannot say that a limitation on incentive

20

earnings is something that is illegal on its face or horrendous

21

It serves a very legitimate

22

25

interest of a labor union and of

its members and I might add as Justice White pointed out that

Now, at time of the hearing the ceilings

machine rate and the ceiling rate.
Now, it. is important to emphasize, that the rule,

15

as it has been consistently interpreted and applied does not

t*

preclude the employee from producing in excess of the ceiling,

i

O

17

and if he does, the extra production physically enters the

18

flow of company operation.

13

The rule merely requires an employee to forego

20

demanding immediate compensation under the banking procedure,

21

that Justice Brennan referred to, for a later time when

22

the receipt of the earnings would be less likely to disrupt

23

employee morale and working conditions.

24

What is that?

A

No.

There are times when the employee's machine

is down due to a breakdown and other shortage of material ©r
something of that sort»
Q

Now, how does the employee usually collect

this bank money?

7

A

Now, in those circumstances under the contract

the company would be obligated,even though he was not turning
out any production-, either at the machine rate or at the lower

70
i

day rate — under these ceiling banking systems the employee

1

can draw on the earnings that he has accumulated in there and

12

be paid at the ceiling rate, and the company has cooperated
by paying him at such a rate.

14
;

Moreover, it has furnished the production card to the

&

union so that the union can periodically check compliance with
17

the ceiling and, furthermore, it pays the union steward for

18

the time that they spend in checking the cards, so that this

!9

ceiling system as it operates in this plant, could not

?,0

possibly operate without a substantial amount of employer

21

cooperation and acquiescense and,indeed, that was the finding

22

of the board and the trial examiner in the court below»
Now, I want to get to the question of the collective

23
24

bargaining.

The ceiling rule, to be sure, was unilateral in

25

origin, if we go back to 1944, or even to 1938 actually when
29

!

f

it first started as a gentleman's agreement among the union
members.
However, since then it has been regularly the
subject of collective bargaining between the employer and
the union when the contracts have come up for negotiation,
indeed, petitioners can see that Page 3 of their brief, that
the ceiling has been the subject of collective bargaining.'
I refer you to the findings of the trial examiner
on Page 68 of the record, which sets forth the way the typical
negotiation works.
"Among the subjects embraced by the contract negotia­
tions is the setting of the ceiling rate."
And skipping down a bit further.
"And so in the typical negotiations the employer
begins by asking the union to agree to eliminate the ceiling,
and as the second alternative proposes a raise in the ceiling.
As an inducement, thereof, it may offer a concession, a form
of a raise and a guarantee hourly machine rate, and the raise
in turn conditions the extent to which the union will agree
to raise the ceiling."
And the trial examiner concludes at the bottom of
Page 69:

"The status thus achieved by the ceiling program is

the product of hard bargaining.®

And this is reflected even

in some of the written agreements that the parties have
concluded.

ii

For instance, the 1953 contract, which is not

30

reprinted, here but is in General Counsel’s Exhibit 17, provided
. specifically that the previous agreement be modified to
increase the ceilings a total of $.13 per hour.
In the 1956 strike-settlement agreement which is set
forth in the record, at Page 49, at the bottom, it says the
j ceilings on earnings is to be raised $.10 per hour above the
general increase
Q

of an earlier date.

Referring to the incentive system here, suppose

that all you had was a collective bargaining agreement provid­
ing for that every employee shall work an eight-hour day at

In other words is your position totally dependent
here on the fact that this is a piecework and incentive
system within an eight-day framework —■ eight-hour day —
| framework.

Suppose it was just an eight-hour day collective

bargaining agreement?
A

I think I would have a much tougher case, but

I think that you could read Allis-Chalmers,which I think is
what we come down to, as standing for the proposition that
so long as the union discipline is confined to fines or
' ©'^Pulsion that did not affect job fights that that was not

31

1

within the reach of 8(b) CD (A).
I think that I have an easier case here because

of the hypothetical that you have given me presents a problem

4

of where the union rule would be going counter,, as I understand]
.

5

the hypothetical, to

the collective agreement of the parties.
■

3

The question is whether that policy is ---

7

Q

If you' would concede, at least for purposes

3

of this discussion, that if the collective bargaining agree­

3

ment provides for only a certain-rate of pay for an eight-hour

10

day, then it gets to be a little difficult, doesn#t it, to

11

distinguish that case f-rom this situation; that is to say,

12

here, you have it.
\

13

-

If you assume that this contract does provide for

14

an eight-hour day and if you would assume, as I take it your

15

opponent asked you to, that the eight-hour day provision carries

15

with it the implied obligation to work as productively as

17
33

reasonably possible during those eight hours.
Then you get into a difficulty of distinguishing

19

those two cases and I take it that what you bring to play then

20

to distinguish those two cases is the fact that this is kind

21

of a half-this and half-that contract; it is half an eight-

22
23
24
25

hour day contract and half a piecework contract which provides
for a level of acceptable production and then for incentive
pay over that.
A

That is correct.
32

I would say that --

1

0

I don't want to lead you or suggest things to

2

you, 1 am just trying to find out readily how you would

3

distinguish those two cases because to my mind that is the

4

nub of the problem»

5

A

Well, I think you are quite right, Your Honor,

6

in saying that our principal line of defense here is that the

7

facts of this case show that this is not a case where what the

S

union is doing here is

3

bargaining agreement.

Q

going contrary to the collective

Well, in responding to that question, you

11

don't think the question between the union and the employee

12

would remain the same in those two cases?

on it, it may be that every employee would get tired if he

13

lived up to the union rule.

For instance, if

and the union put a ceiling

Well, I said that in order to -—

17

Q

Here you say, and your position is, that the rule!

18

if the employee obeys it isn't a breach of contract and that

19

the employee couldn't get fired for it, but would that change

20

the legal position of the union vis-a-vis the member?

■

ti

21

A

I don't think it would if you read Allis-Chalmersj

22

as broadly as I was suggesting that it could be read, namely,

23

that 8 (b) (1) (A) does not reach the -union when it imposes

24

reasonable discipline and by hypothesis would —-

23

Q

And the union might be in breach of contract:
33

1

in an eight-hour day case, itself with a rule like this.
A

2

It might,

As I say, if you read Allis-Chalmers

o

as holding that 8(b)(1)(A) does not reach reasonable union

ft

discipline for violation of a membership rule that is not

5

ultravires or invalid on its face, then, I think, we coma up

8

with the same conclusion in the hypothetical that Justice

7

Fdrtas

'4

has given me as I am coming out here,
I don't think, however, that it is necessary to

3
3

answer that question for this case because on the findings

10

of the board and

the examiner and the court of appeals I

n

think that we have a much easier case because on those findings

12

what the union rule here is not in conflict with the collective

13

bargaining agreement.
This is one of those situations which a Crofessor

'34

and Dean Shulman referred to in their writing when they have

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Silard,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S1LARD, ESQ.

Cj

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SILARD:

.8

Mr. Chief Justice, members cf the

6

Court:

Justice Fortas asked an interesting question:

7

a union by by-law could say to the member:

Whether

"violate your

contract," and if it did so Justice White says the union may
j

©
10
11

be violating

the contract and Justice Fortas asks v/hethar

the union may not also be violating Section 8(b) (1).
We say probably, given a case where the union

12

contracts a certain requirement under the contract, such as

18

the eight-hour day in an ordinary hourly rated plant.

14

the next day they put in a by-lav/ when the contract goes into

IS

effect that says notwithstanding — never mind the contract —

m

no member of this union shall work more than seven hours.

17

Then

We are tempted to say that that would be a violation

18

of 8(b)(3) by means of fines against the member.

19

words, we take this view that while Congress protected the

20

relationship of the member and the union from intrusion by

2t

the labor board.

22

In other

It is the internal disputes of the kind Allis-

23

Chalmers and this case involve.

24

union sought to violate the rights of others that the statute

25

protects, for instance, the rights of neutrals under 8(b)(4),
39

If, by membership control, a

f

by requiring a member to engage in a secondary boycott, which

2

is described in Page 31 of our brief.

3

We think that that goes too far, that the exemption

4

of Section 0(b)(1) of union discipline cannot go so far a*-: be

5

permit union discipline to become a means for violating other

6

rights that the statute protects.
Q

7

The employees here, though, are henofielariesi­

&

to this contract or parties to it, and they do have a contrac.

9

tual right against the employer to take advantage of the

10

incentive plan and to be paid and to collect their money-

11

then.

12,

A

If this were

13

Q

And when they work and say pay me, the employer

14
13
m
17

must pay them.
A

And that right, this union by-law certainly —
Right —no, I wouldn't say right, Your Honor.

I would say wrong on two counts.
If this were the case of a union by by-law requiring

18

a member not to live up to this contract we say that two

!3

distinctions in this case, and I want to emphasize that quite

20

two simple reasons why, this by-law is not the order of the

2!

Homebuilders case.

22

The first reason is that the men are doing a fair

23

day's work e%s-en within this ceiling and, therefore, has never

24

said and does not now say that there is any idleness in this

23

plant by virtue of these ceilings.

40

%

The second reason is that even if there were an

2

issue after- a fair day's work, this employer has contracted for

3

16

4

level of the ceiling.

years and consecutive agreements, with the union as to the

S?

If the ceiling is too low to permit a man to do a

6

fair day's work, then the employer is a party to the ceiling

7

because he has agreed over and over again as to what the

b

ceiling will be.

9

Q

Conceeding that, though, there still is the

10

fact that the union by-law does interfere with the contractual

11

rights of the employee against the employer.

12

A

Let us say it this way.

The union by-lav? —

13

I will say it. impinges upon the contract by the employer, but

H

may I say this:

«5

directly impinge upon the right of the union as to Allis-Chalmei “S

So that to say that a union by-law touches upon an
area of employment rights —

That isn't what I am saying.

any consequences to it, I just wanted to know doesn't this

q

But these union members collected their money

and they worked over the ceiling asking the employer to be
paid now, they were paid, as they were entitled to be as far
as the employer was concerned, and the union fines them for it*

A

That is right.

May 1 say then, to this Court, that the ultimate
question seems to have to be:

What is the guiding prcxncsa.»!-,-..

to'Allis-Chalmers and Marine Workers.
We say there are two tests to be made in a case of
this kind, because we say that Section 8(c)(1) now does not
restrict the union from enforcing by discipline a membership
rule not plainly ultravires unless the ruling makes an employer’s
rights protected elsewhere in the statute.
Before I get into the law may set this Court s at-Lention to Footnote 5 on Page 9 of our brief,- because this fair
day * s work issue was bargained, out between the ewo sides very
recently.
In the middle of Footnote 5 on Page 9 we have the
minutes of the negotiations in 1965 when, after contractual
negotiations the ceilings were again raised, at the employer’s
insistence.
reflected:

Interestingly, in these minutes, the following is

company is saying this is what has happened.

The

The union is

ii

saying it hasn't and they resolved it by increasing the ceilings

(2

three cents per hour.

13

So that the very issue as to a fair day’s work as to

14

against slow-down has been bargained by these parties and the

IS

result has been compromise.

16

We say, therefore, the very hard case that Justice

17

Fortas put, of a union ruler requiring a man to violate a

18

contract is simply not before this Court in a double sense

19

that, this particular arrangement in existence since 1944 has

20

won acquiscence, acceptance and agreement from the employer

21

as it applies to union members and that in any event even if

22

it had not won that acquiescence the scheme as it operates

23

is not a production limiting slow-down scheme.

24
25

Men are doing-a fair day’s work under it.
that this is

To say

featherbedding because a man can’t use the

44

absoluta maximum incentive to produce the absolute last piece,,
is to say that hourly wages is featherbedding.

Because it is

perfectly clear that under hourly wages?that five out of six
industrial employees are now employed under hourly wages, not
under incentive? under hourly wages there is no incentive for
the man to work his head, off, or work himself to death to earn
a living.
Now, is that featherbedding?

We don’t think so.

Therefore, to say that a reasonable ceiling on what incentive
pay shall be earned is no more featherbedding or slow-down
or make an hourly rate a slow-down.
I am sorry, Your Honor. I shouldn't have interrupted
you.
Q

Oh, that is all right.

Mr. SiXard, that is not

quite it, I think, because my question to you is whether, let
us
take a case of a collective bargaining agreement that
/
provides for an eight-hour day, and then I posed a question of
what would be the result if the union sought to enforce a rule,
a union rule, saying that in those eight hours you may produce
only

X

number of units?

A

And those units would be less than a fair day's

production, is that what you are saying?

Q

All right,

A

Well, if it is not less than a fair day's produc

20

25

would concede, as in Homebuilders

and we do in our brief, that you probably have an 8(b)(c) in
the sense that here is a union rule due to some interest in the
promulgating and, nonetheless,

so infringes on the employer's

rights, that the union has an obligation to sit down and
bargain that rule out with the employer, and if it refuses
to do so, and, in effect, changes the conditions of work,

15

manufacturing and the membership said;

17

hated incentive rates — "If that happens here", the men said,

18

"we are going to put upon ourselves in this union the restric- (

19

fcion, a reasonable restriction, that 10 or 20 percent above

20

those rates is what we are going to stop drawing our pay.

going to be outworked by an eager beaver who can db a fantastic

25

performance, with great skill, at the capacity of a man 18 or

23

8(b) CD permits the union to have rules not plainly ultravires

24
23

We think the National Labor Relations Act, Section

where there is a legitimate union interest on the line.
To say there is no legitimate union interest in

50

1

this situation of putting an upper limit on piece rate , is

2

really to say that there is no legitimate union interest in

3

the negotiation of hourly wages and yet five out of ;six workers

4

work on hourly wages.

5

That is, the unions have found incentive schemesr

6

if they are not regarded or checked by any upper limits, to be

1

corrosive of the internal relationships within the union, to

8

lead to speed-ups, to lay-offs and to demoralization, net that

9

is a legitimate union interest.

10

The board, the examiner, the courts of law all

11

it to ba a legitimate union interest, which goes further,

12

think, than Allis-Chalraers required this Court to go in

13

looking at this union rule from the' point of view c,£ its

14

ultravires side of the rule.

15

We say a rule that is not plainly ultravires i>

find

the

16

sense that it impinges on some personal civil liberty or right,

17

but within the area of the union's legitimate judgments about

18

the interests of men.

19

It is clearly protected under Section 8(b)(1)(A)

20

frdra labor board intrusion, unless, and X w^nt to come bad

21

the unless, unless the rule is being used as a means of

22

subverting the other rights protected by the Act, such as

23

Sections 8(b)(2), 8(b)(3), or 8(b)(4).

24
25

I want to point out to this Court that there is no
proviso to Section 8(b)(2), 8(b)(3) or 8(b)(4) such as a

51

to

proviso for Section 8 (b)(1), and that Marine Workers in our
opinion is essentially demonstrative of only the fact that
:

the limits of exemption Congress afforded to union, to apply™
■r

ing non~ultravires rules to their members by membership
discipline are reached.
When yon come to an intrusion by such discipline upon
.

some other person’s protective right under the Act, the neutral

1

under 8(b)(4), the employer under 8(b)(3) others under 8(b)(2).
I see my time is about to expire and I want to make
one point to this Court because we lost fcra ck of it .

That is

the point that we are not here in front of this Court saying
"Either there is no" — we are not saying this because there
is no relief for injustices and arbitrariness in this entire
area.
As I said to the Court, in Allis-Chalmers, the
common law courts have traditionally been available; this
Court, in Gonzales, said it is in the common law courts that
you go if union rules are being arbitrarily applied and you qet
back in the union if you are wrongfully thrown out.
The question is this;

Mot whether there shall be

relief somewhere, because the ease has been pending in eight
years in Wisconsin and we just lost it last year'-- it is in
our brief -- on the merits of collecting this fine, so there
is plenty of remedy in the State courts? the question is,
f

shall the labor board get into this thicket, into what
52

1

Professor Cox called the "dismal swamp of 8(b)(1) litigation

2

of this kind.

3

We say that the most important reason

not to tamper

4

with a Congressional decision in 1947 and 1959, to leave this

5

outside the province of the labor board, is that the labor

6

board has been entrusted with the function of being the

7

principal arbitrator between management and union.

8
S

Now, if chat principal arbitration function, that
function of being the mediator, the man in between the two

10

contending sides, if, in addition, by rewriting of 1947 history,

n

the labor board also now becomes the policeman of intraunion

12

conduct, then its credibility, its acceptance of the union’s

13

side of this nation’s forces, will be impaired.

14

. There is nobody less well situated to become the

15

policeman of intraunion judgments find disputes of this kind.

18

One man says:

17

"I don’t like it".

18

said:

19

between the two contending sides which shall not go in there

20

and become the policeman of union discipline and union rule."

21

"I like this union rule" and the other says:
Wisdom was requested by Congress when it

"It is precisely the labor board which is the mediator

We think great political wisdom is requested in
/

22

that judgment, and that seems to be the paramount reason

23

this Court should leave the matters and disputes of this kind

24

in the common law court, that is precisely why the labor board

25

is the last body that Congress would have wanted in and never
53

why

1

put them into this business.

2

It wanted justice for everybody in deciding, is this

3

a good rule', a bad rule or a reasonable rule or an unreasonable

4

rule, sociably desirable rule or not» •
Do we agree with the majority of 98 percent of the

5
6

men at this plant who’have always voted for this rule» Th< t

7

is precisely why it was hot for the labor board, and we believe

8

that it had better be left where this Court said, in Gonzales,

9

it was left to the common law courts where a man who is imprope rly

10

disciplined

can get relief and if the rule upon which he js

11

punished is an arbitrary rule, the common law courts will not

12

enforce it»

13

As in Gonzales they will put him back in the union

14

if he is expelled, they will give him back his damages if he

IS

has had any damages.
The issue is keeping some clear lines of jurisdiction

16
17

For• the. present time we submit our rights and we corne back,

18

therefore, to the following rule which we need in all respects.

19

A rule not ultravires — the union rule not plainly ultravires

20

does not violate Section 8(b)(1) when it is enforced by

24
25

Is that because it is not

Now, if Chalmers didn't reach the proviso he would

say you would get the same result under a fair reading of the

Which route are you taking to get there?

I would say in a case that came before the

Court, I have always felt the proviso was probably such a

11

clear expression of Congress' statement that this whole area

12

was left outside the board's jurisdiction, that 1 would rest

13

oxi the proviso rather than on the reconstruction of restraint

14

of coerce, however ——

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES URDAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. URDAN:

I would like to comment first on the

last two points made by counsel for the union.

Do you suggest that he negotiate a different level

A

20

to proceed.

21

We speak for the men who are working under a contract that

22

doesn't say that.

23

the work they produce and union is trying to prevent them

24

from doing this.

25

This would be the proper way for the employer
We do not coma here speaking for the employer.

The contract says they will be paid for

You are perfectly corx'ect that the employer has his

57

remedy in collective bargaining.

These employees do not.

Now,, the union tells us that the rule here is not a production
restriction? as such.
They cite various text writers who tell reasons
why incentive pay is objectionable.

These texts — they are

interesting — but that isn't what the union witnesses said
at the hearing.

One of the founders of the union and a - an

who was intimately involved in the creation of the ceiling
testified at the heari'ng.

This is at Page 45 of the Appendix.

We wanted to see that this labor state keep as many
fellows working as we possibly could, and we

know if we put

this thing on there it would provide for at least a few more
fellows to stay at work.

He says the fellows are for this feeling because
it provides jobs and then he x^ent on.

He was asked what

He didn't say

He didn't say the older workers would

He didn't recite any of these reasons.

He says if the ceiling were taken off it would mean
a lot of jobs.

That is what the union was trying to accomplish,,

having more men at work than were required.
Nowi the union doesn’t need this powernot like the Allis-Chalmers case

This is

where you have no way to

prevent a man from going to work during a strike.

Allis-Chalmers case there is no contract in existence.

That

In the Aliis-Chalmerse the employer invites

7

the workers back and will take them back and pay them if they

8

come back to work.

9

And if he does, the union fines him.

10

An employee sayss

"I want to come to work.
Do you think that is

different.

A

It

I might say, first, we certainly don't agree

12

with the Aliis-Chalmers decision.

13

opinion makes considersbly more sense to us on our side.
Q

14

I think the dissenting

And furthermore in Aliis-Chalmers if the

15

■employee obeyed the rule and stayed away, it might very wall

be that he wouldn't have a job because he micyhfc be permanently

17

replaced.
A

18

That is

exactly right.

I think this is a great,

19

evil of the Aliis-Chalmers and a great evil of the union

20

position here, that it puts the employee in the middle.
Union brief says,

21
22

"Should an employee refuse to

produce a fair day's work under a union pay ceiling the union
is free to discipline or discharge the worker."
