Mr. Johnston, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN JOHNSTON, ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10

MR. JOHNSTON:

May it please the Court, this case

11

is similar in some respecte to the decision In the case that

12

resulted in the decision of Epson v, Arkansas which this Court

1.3

decided just this morning.

14

1*5

j

The case is here on Certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

16

One major distinction between Epson and this case is

17

that this case involves the right of public school students rather

18

than public school faculty members to exercise expressions of

19

their opinions in a non-disruptive way in the school.

20

Q

This Is not a religious establishment case?

21

A

No, it is not, your Honor.

It is a First Amendment

22

free speech case in the sense of expression of views rather than

23

a worship.

24
25

The case began as a petition for Injunction and
nominal damages under 42 United States Code 1983 in the United

j

States PIstriot Court for tile Southern District of Iowa»

That

; Court dismissed the Petition and on appeal to the Circuit the
■
■ decision was split four to four.
The conduct of the students was essentially this.
Thao at Christmas in 1965, they decided that they would wear
small black armbands to express certain views which
in regard to the war in Vietnam.

they had

Specifically, the viewa

that they mourn the dead on both sides, both civil11an and
military in that war and they supported the proposal that had
been made by United States Senator Robert Kennedy that the
truce which had been proposed for that war over the Christmas
period be made an open ended or indefinite truce.

This was the

purpose that the students gave for wearing the armband during
this period.
During this period of time, of course, there were

school days and they wore the am bands to school.
Prior to the time when any of these petitioners wore
the arm bands to school, it came to the attention of the
school authorities that perhaps there would be some students
who would express views relating to the war in Vietnam in this
manner during school time.
The principals of the secondary schools, the high
j schools and perhaps the junior high schools in the City of
Des Moines public school system met prior to the time any of
j the arm bands had been worn and enacted a policy which was not
-.4»

2

written but which was agreed upon among themselves that no
public
student could wear an arm band in the Des Moines/School system

3

for this purpose| that if the student came into school wearing

4

the arm band he would be asked to remove it; failing that* the

3

student*s parents would be contacted and their assistance would

6

be solicited in getting the students to remove the arm bank;

7

failing that* the students would be sent home — would be in

•3

effect suspended from school until such time as they were willln

9

to return to school without the arm bands.

'3

10

The three students who are petitioners in this case*

ii

Christopher Eckhardt* who is 16 and in the 10th grade at

12

Roosevelt High School; John Tinker* 15* in the 11th grade;

13

Mary Beth Tinker* 13* and in the 8th grade* determined that in

14

spite of the policy that had been announced through the school;-

15

they would wear the arm bands as a matter of conscience to

express the views that they had,

17

Christopher Eckhardt and Mary Beth Tinker wore theirs

on the first day,

20

He xtfent immediately to the office of the Principal

Mr, Eckhardt went to school having the arm

21

and said "I am wearing the arm band,

22

violation of the school policy."

23

I know that it is in

The Principal carried out the dictates of the policy*

24

which were to tell the students to remove it.

25

he could not in good conscience remove it* that he thought he

The student said

I

1

had a right to wear it.
The student’s mother was called and she supported her

2
3

son in the activity and then young Mr* Eekhardt was suspended

4

from school*

S

Five days prior to the Christmas vacation and then one day after

6

the Christmas vacation,

He was out of school approximately six days.

Mary Beth Tinker also wore her arm band on that first

7
8

day*

However* she wore it throughout the entire morning without

9

any incident related to it in any way that disrupted the school

10

or distracted.

11

was by the way some conversation between herself and other

12

students in the lunch room as to why she was wearing the arm

13

band* and she wore it into the first class in the afternoon.

14

She wore it to lunch and she wore it where there

It was in the first class in the afternoon when she

15

was called to the office and the procedure was followed for

16

contacting her parents* apparently asking her to remove it,

17

and she did remove the arm band and then returned to class*

18

However, in spite of the fact that she did remove

f

19

the arm band she was later called into the office and suspended,

ao

nevertheless *

21

John Tinker determined that it was his belief that

22

the arm band should not be worn in open violation of the policy

23

that the schools had adopted until some attempt had been made

24

to try to reach and accommodation with the School Board,

25

On the first day John Tinker did not wear the am

!■

band to school,

On the evening of the day when Mr* Eckhafdt

2

and John’s sister* Mary Beth* were suspended from school* he

3

with some other students who had worn the arm bands attempted

4

to contact the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the

5

Des Moines Public Schools and they requested that he call a

6

special meeting of the Board of Directors of the School Board*

'7

as we call it* for the purpose of trying to reach an accommo­

S

dation between the students and the policy enacted by the
Principals of the Schools,
They were refused this special meeting of the School

10

H

Board and then on the next day* Friday* John Tinker wore his

12

arm band to school and wore it throughout the morning hours

13

without any toward incident* without any substantial and

14

material disruption to the school.

15

there was again some discussion about it in the period that is

16

generally free for an open discussion among students* and then

17

wore it into the first class in the afternoon where he was

18

suspended.

He wore it at lunch where

Q

What if the student had gotten up from the class and

20

delivered a message orally what his arm band was intended to

22

A

In that case vie would not be here.

Even if he

23

insisted on doing it only for a second* although he would be

24

expressing his views* he would be doing something else.

don’t think there is any suggestion that the school attempts to

Our contention is that the policy as it was adopted#

it was a broad policy# it was not distinct# or not in any way

directed toward disruption or distraction.

It is a policy

that will not stand the test of freedom of speech undei’ the

type responsibilities that the state has an obligation to try

to move directly against those causing the disruption rather

16

than take away the first Amendment right of expression.

17

again we don’t reach that in this case because there is simply

18

not that kind of evidence in the record.

But

■'e

19

Q

No clear and present danger principle?

20

A

No.

As the Fifth Circuit in two cases* Burnside vs.

21

Byars* seems to indicate* and Blackwell -- the )3yars case is

22

cited In our Brief **- a material and substantial disruption to

23

the schools would justify perhaps the subornation of freedom of

2.

Well a the facts of the Terrainiello .case are not

necessarily applicable to class rooms.

4

and the thing, your Honor, that we have been trying to deal with

5

in thi3 case since the trial is the concept that whole special

rules, whole special doctrines, for some reason should be

applied to First Amendment law in schools.

16

And so that there could certainly be some whispering

There is no doubt about that.

or anything?

purposes that it was there for,
Q

Is there any evidence that they have done that in this

record?
A

There is not.

As I say, there was discussion from

discussion in the halls.

There was some

There is, and 1 am frank to say,

when John Tinker wore the arm band, in the first hour they were
engaged in a class which was a free discussion type of class,
The. instructor of the class was outside the room and he was
asked during that period about the arm band and he did explain
to the students why he wore it.

And we are urging upon the

court the concept that especially in the public schools, which
this Court recognised this morning in the Arkansas case and
which it has recognised many times before, that it is important
that the idea of freedom of dissent and inquiry in expression
be maintained in the schools, and there is certainly nothing in
this record which indicates that sufficient quantum of evidence
to overcome that pre.3U.mption.
Q
this.

As I understand It, and 1 want to be very clear about
In response to my brother White's question, if the

record shows that wearing of the arm band significantly or
substantially or materially, or whatever is the right word,
interferred with the business of the class room, that is,
communication between teachers and students, then you would say
that disciplinary action would be justified?
A

I think we could take that position.

I want to make

a distinction, if I may, between an expression of an opinion
which might its disrupt the class, and the expression of opinion
which might cause someone else to disrupt the class.
-

15-

And I

bell

erh&ps two separate cases.
1 -would also like to make a distinction between the

expression of opinion which is coupled with something else,
marching in the hallway or standing up in the class and making
a speech about the war in Vietnam during mathematics class; that
kind of thing I think the Court can prohibit.
We are in a situation here where the,record simply
doesn*t support that kind of a situation.

Rather it supports

the idea that before anyone wore an arm band really on the basis\
of pure conjecture that the policy was adopted frankly for the
purpose — and the administrators and teachers say this over
and over again -- it was the principle of the demonstration,
the idea of expressing political beliefs that they were opposed
to in this context, and the students were suspended for violating
y.
V

that policy and not suspended for causing any disruption in the

class room
Q

Suppose the state passed a law applying a ban on

black arm bands for protest purposes, across the board, so that
it be applied in private schools as well, would that be
t

constitutional?

|
A

1 think that would probably, your Honor, interfere

with some earlier decision of this Court probably in regard to
the right of individuals, of citizens, to establish private
schools, and so long as they met accreditation standards to
educate their children as they see fit, X think that is probably
»16

1
*2

a different kind of situation from what we have here.

2

The situation here is not based on the conduct of

3

the students, whether or not it was permissible, but the conduct'

4

of the atate,whether or not the conduct of the state was

5

permissible, whether or not we have a situation of pure expressio- ,

6

with no evidence of substantial disruption of any public Interes;

7

whether or not that in that situation the state can move to

a

subornate and to punish freedom of expression.

Justice Fortas, 1 believe that the real question in

that the students were engaged in expression of views privileged

What is your opinion, if you care to express one?

A

My opinion would be in that instance that probably

17

again it would depend a lot upon what the students said and

the demeanor of the student when he expressed it, and things of

19

that sort, that probably would not be within the purview of the

OF ALLAH a* HERRICK, esq,,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR* HERRICK:

Mr, Chief Justice and Associate justices!,

,

. The Respondents believe there are two basic issues involved here,

;

The first is do the school administrators or- school
boards have to wait until violence, disorder and disruption
•break out in a scholarly discipline of the school is disrupted
or may they act when in good faith in their reasonable discretit’
and judgment disorder and disruption of a scholarly atmosphere
of the school room will result unless they act firmly and
promptly?
The second issue, it seems to me, is that this Court
must determine how far it wants to go under the constitutional
amendments for free speech in reviewing every decision of every
school district made in good faith in its reasonable discretion
and judgment as necessary to maintain order In a scholarly
discipline atmosphere within the class room.
A third issue might be added.

Are disturbances or

threatened disturbances in the schools to be measured by
identical standards with disturbances or threatened disturbances
on the streets?
It is the position of the Respondents that the
decision of the school administration and of the School Board
made in good faith under the circumstances existing when that
decision was made, was the reasonable exercise of discretion

3

Mow, this Court has held that freedom of speech,

4

including, of course, the. right of demonstration, is not an

5

absolute right to be exercised regardless of time or place.

I am sure it isn't necessary to quote to this Court

7

its own decisions, but the case of Adderley vs. State of

Am I correct?
1

think, if the Court please, that dodsn*t give us

3

the entire background that builds up to what was existing in

4

the Des Moines Schools at the time the arm bands were worn.
As we view it, the right of freedom of speech or the

5

right of demonstration in the school room and on the school

7

premises must be weighed against the right of the school

&

administration to make decisions which the administration

a

believed in good faith, believed in its discretion, was reason­

10

able to preserve order and to avoid this disturbance and

11

disruption in the school.

12

Q

And had there been any disruption?

13

I will refer to that also, your Honor.

There had

14

been with John Tinker what I would call disruption.

21

until disruption occurs, or may it act to—

22
23
24
25

Q

The school system was aroused?

Where is that in the

record?
A

I think I can point that out, if the Court please.

In the background of this case, in November of 1965, the

-24

X
t

petitioner# Christopher- ••kH-;hardt, with his mother, who was

2

President of the Des Moines Chapter of the Womens1 International

3

League for Peace and Freedom, had come to Washington, D, C. to

4

participate with the students for democratic society on the

5

spot and others in the- march which I am sure this Court is

$

familiar with, from the White House to the Washington Monument.

7

That was in November, I think, about the Thanksgiving

a

Holiday.
i

9

On Saturday, December 11, 1965, following this march,

10

a group which included students related to Students for

11

Democratic Society, and some adults, met at the Eckhardt home

12

and one of the proposals that was developed at this meeting was

13

the wearing of these black arm bands.

;

14

Now, none of these petitioners were present.

Now,

15

as the trial court said — and this is on page 73 of the

18

appendix, the last paragraph:

disruption and might even result in violence.

11

Now, in substance, if we understand the Petitioners'

position in this case, it is that the school officials are

13

powerless to act until the disruption occurs.

Respondents believe that should not be the rule,

Sometimes an ounce of prevention is a lot better than a pound

of cure, and I think the subsequent history of such activities

and several other students with whom I ate frequently, these
people warned me In a friendly manner to take the arm band off;
and one student with whom I had a fued in the ?th grade was
making 3mart remarks for about ten minutes.

There were four

or five people with him standing milling around there and
there were quite a few other students standing and milling
around the lunch room.
To my knowledge, there were no threats to hit me or
anything like that.

But at no time was I in fear that they

What was involved , X think* Your Honor* was that it

was disruptive of the atmosphere of the school room.
I would like to ask you a question because you seemed j

Q

to have admitted some things rather modestly.

12

Do I understand that you have admitted that the

13

constitution of the United States forbids the people of a state

14

from barring political discussion in their schools, if they want!

IS

to do ao?

16

At

17
18

No, I don't believe I admitted that.

I think if the

'

situation broke down-Q

I didn't think you intended to.

A person doesn't

19

have any more right to make some symbolic speech than he does

20

actually to talk and .engage in speech that the First Amendment

21

protects. If not, why wouldn't these boys have a right to dernanp.
> j
that the school let them talk about Vietnam?

22
23

24
23

A

Oh, they would, and it is in the record here free

discussion of these matters is permitted,
Q

You are saying you have a right to run your school
”•37

1

for the teaching of geography, history, mathematics, grammar,

bW*

and the things that people want to teach; and if the federal

3

constitution doesn't step in and tell you you have to let anybody

4

discuss any subjects symbolic or otherwise that they see fit?

5
C

A

I think so long as it doesn't interrupt or disrupt

the atmosphere.

"7

Q.

It would be disrupted if he broke a valid rule?

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

You are arguing whether or not this rule Is valid of

W

its constitutional protection?

11
13

'

A

That is right.

Q

And do you think the constitution prevents the school :

«■*./»

from barring the discussion particularly of acute emotional

14

subjects such as this is, and allows them to say that we will

15

have nothing in here except the teaching of the things that

16

the school—

17

A

1 think within reason that is true.

18

Q.

You wouldn't say, would you, Mr. Herrick, that in

19

doing that they could pick out one particular issue and say this

20

you cannot do, but the rest you can do?

21

A

I would go further than that, your Honor.

I would

22

say today if the same proposition comes up, if the atmosphere

23

is different, it should be permitted.

24

what existed here that the school administration and School

25

Board acted reasonably and within their discretion at that time

My only claim here is

It could be very different today,

Q

Do I understand you to be saying now it is all right

4

for them to interrupt grammar classes, history classes, and

5

mathematics classes and any other classes that the school is

6

suppose to teach, in order to talk about Vietnam?

1

A

No, I think that that is not correct.

If I have given

8

that impression I am sorry.

9

the schools are there to give these children an education, and

X don't believe that,

I believe

10

I think Des Moines is one of the great spots in the nation where

n

they have done it.

12

that type of scholarly atmosphere in the class room out to be

prohibited.

That is a question.

On page 29 it says the whole period of mathematics

17

on Wednesday xuas taken up by this discussion of student

demonstration,

18

A

That is correct.

20

Q

So they haven’t forbide it in the schools, but

Z\

mathematics, after all, is whan ought to be taught in the

22

mathematics class and I think they ar e entitled to regulate.

23

That is what this is, a regulation.

24
25

I seem to remember in reading the Briefs in advance
for this argument there was something here about other students
39-

•fl

i

wearing other badges or symbols.

2

find it, except the footnote 2 of Petitioners5 Brief with

3

respect to some of the students have been seen wearing iron

crosses.
Is there anything else?

B
€

A

I think there was.

7

Q

In the record?

3

A

Iron crosses.

9

But now glancing over 1 can't

And I think sometimes they had worn

political buttons.

•10

Q

Does that show in the record, that you remember?

11

A

It does, your Honor.

12

Q

What do you do with Meyer and Henken and Casteel

13
14
15

j

against Iowa?
A

Meyer v. Nebraska is forbidding teaching the German

language.

m

Q

Yes.

v/

A

Surely.

Those were decided in 1923.
Again, your Honor, I would have to go back

»0

to the situation that the Court really doesn’t sit down in a

19

situation that the school administration or school board does.

29

They have to say is this so unreasonable this is violating the

21

constitutional right.

22

Q

I

That is the test?

That the Court make a judgment as

23

to whether it is so unreasonable, and, if it is, if we think

24

it is unreasonable -- which I suppose would be excessively

25

unreasonable -- then we say it is a violation of the due process
-40

3

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and then wd tell the School
Board what

3

it can or cannot do.

Is that your argument?

I am

asking your opinion,
A

4

My opinion is if the Court undertakes to go that far, !

■'

you. are getting into a very difficult field Of trying to say

6

in every instance--

■

7

0.

I agree with you.

3

A

Whether a regulation is or is not a violation of

<5

W

constitutional rights.

I think some things have to be left to

the judgment of the administration.

11

Q.

You would have to agree with me, wouldn't you, that

12

Meyer and Bartell present very serious obstacles, because

13

certainly those cases stand for the proposition that a state

14

criminal law making it a criminal offense not to teach German

15

is

16

state exercise of power of state schools, this court declared

17

that law as unconstitutional in 1923?

18

unreasonable, and that although that is the state law and

A

I say this, your Honor.

I think every case must be

18

reviewed on its own facts, and I think that is the difficulty

26

in this court getting into the situation.

21

Q

This was a public school?

22

A

Yes, sir.

23

Q

Didn't Meyer have some reservation about public

24
25

schools or private schools in those cases-A

Yes, sir.

Mr. Johnston, you have a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN L. JOHNSTON, ESQ.

4

MR. JOHNSTON*

Thank you.

I would like to point out

-5

one of the things which I believe has been Mentioned and needs

6

to be;mentioned more firmly, that was there was no general

7

prohibition against political emblems of this nature*

8
9
JO

31
.12

13

Q

Under the law of Iowa, the school was acting within

the authority of the state law?
A

The school was acting, your Honor, under a very broad

state statute.
Q

Well* is there any question about that?

Do we have

to look into that?

U

A

No,

15

Q

Ve have to accept that they were engaged in doing what

16
17

the law gives them the right to do?
A

Gives them the power to do*

But the point 1 would

ie

like to impress upon the Court at this time, that is on pages

13

44 and 50 and 51 of the record, it is very amply stated by

20

Respondents that other kinds of political insignia, including

21

the iron cross, were worn in these schoolsj that they were not

22

covered by this policy; that it was simply this one policy

as

against the wearing of the arm bands in this context.

24
25

Mow, counsel indicates that there was some sort of
explosive situation which made ibis a special circumstance,
«

42

-

i can't, of course, recite the record to prove the
negative, I can simply say X don't believe that the record
supports that kind of situation*
Q

If that is a valid rule was it an explosive situation,

an interruption, if it is a valid rule?
A

Yes, your Honor, It is.

But our point is that the

rule is not valid because it is based solely upon a Fourteenth
Amendment type standard of reasonableness,
Q

I must say I agree with some of the implications of
.

my Brother Fortas about the reasonableness rule.

I think the

Court was very careful to say this morning that it wasn't
deciding that case.
A

For instance, in the Barnett case, which we have

cited in the Brief, which was a case of compulsory flag

saluting,

this Court

specifically

said that the mere Fourteenth :

Amendment tests of reasonableness are not sufficient in the
schools when the students are engaged in something or where the :
conduct involves something that Is privileged under the First
Amendment.

That is the suggestion we have here.

The reasons

for the School Board establishing the regulation are set out
on page 70 of the record by a document promulgated by the
School Board.

Those reasons were reduced to paper after the

suspensions and a week after the suspensions is simply to my
reading of the decisions of this Court do not provide sufficient
grounds for subornation of freedom of speech.

Is it your view that your State of Iowa is without

Z

power*, if it sees fit, to bar politiosi cl.i.scussj.ons in tn©

school where children are being taught?

4

A

I believe it has the power.

But it is rot necessary

in this case because that is not what they have done, your

Honor.

instance and that is all there is,

■8

20

Q

j.

They have banned only the discussion In one specific

You are raising something similar to an equal pro™

tection argument?
A

In addition to the other argument,

And I believe

21

the stronger argument is not the equal protection, not the

12

censorship by discrimination, as Mr, Justice Black is calling

13

it# but, as a matter of fact, the stronger argument is that

i

•

'

14

the Interest that the state sought to protect, whatever that

IS

may have been, is set out on page 70 of the record, whereas

IS

that is not sufficient, whereas it might have been sufficient

17

to suppress something that is not privileged,

1.8

Q

The real interest the State Is trying to protect is
:

19

the State authority of the teachers to run the school and

20

establish the rules for teaching, rather than the pupils?

21

that the interest it is trying to protect?

22

23
24
25

A

I don't read that from the record.

Isn’t

I believe froii the

record what the school wants—
Q

Which do you think has the most control in the school,

the pupil policy of teaching the pupils, or the authorities

-44 „

1

2

that are running the schools?
A

The authorities that are running the school under

3

the authority given to them by the constitution of the United

4

States and within the provisions of that constitution and the

5

whole nub of our case is that they have exceeded their powers

6

under that.
