MR, CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr, Brown?
ARGUMENT OF ALLEN BROWN, ESQ,

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

S
7

MR. BROWN:

8

We have before us a case arising in the State of Ohio

9

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court

under a conviction under Ohiocs Criminal Syndicalism Act, We

10

have,, indeed* before us something of a rarity.

It is* as far as

11

I know* the third case ever tried under Ohio8s Criminal Syndi-

12

calism Act* and the first to ever reach an appellant level,

13

There was earlier in Ohio* under a peculiar proceed­

14

ings in -which a prosecutor could bring a proceeding before the

15

Supreme Court on appeal for a question of law? only* a proceeding

16

in which a motion was made in the lower court in Ohio attacking

17

the constitutionality of Ohio9s criminal syndicalism law.
The lower court in Ohio held the law to be unconsti­

1©
19

tutional.

20

Kassey* and in what is basically an advisory opinion* the Court

21

stated that it was constitutional.

22

several engaging other things.

23
24
25

It was appealed to the Supreme Court in State versus

But the Court also stated

It stated that the First. Amendment did not apply to
the States of the Union.
It also stated that the measure of its application was
2

1

an Issue In its constitutionality and that It would attend the

2

first trial of the case to see what is the proper measure of

3

its application.

4

The Court waited patiently for the first application

5

to a case, and it arose some 49 years later in this cassaf and

surprisingly, despite the invitation sent out in Kassey, the

7

Court declined to even hear a constitutional question on the

application in this case.

Court Ohio's privilege of setting forth the limitations of the

It, in effect, defaulted to this

1©

application of its statute, and Ohio’s privilege of setting

•11

forth the potentiality of clarification and delineation of a

12

statute which obviously, on its face, rushes headlong into the

13

First .amendment.

14

These are the facts in this cases

15

A television reporter received a telephone call indi­

16

cating that if he wanted to, he could come and take movies of

17

a Ku Klnx Klan meeting.

18

and arrangements were made for the taking of a movie.

19

was taken in which a cross was burned, some figures milled about

20

and yelled some stupid and rather senseless slogans, and then a

21

single figure was panned in on who made a speech, a speech full

£2

of conditions, precedents, and reservations, and hyperbole self-

23

evidently stupid and silly.

24
25

He came.

He met some hooded figures
A movie

He asserted that, the Klan was the largest organisation
in the State of Ohio.

He then went on with a conditioned
3

1

precedent that if the 'various branches of the Government, in­

z

cluding this Court, do not mend their ways, that "revengeance",

3

a word of his own coining, I assume, would be taken.

4

not specify the "revengeance" and we do not know what particu­

5

lar aspect of the democratic process he was going to involve him

6

self in "revengeance".

He did

He then spoke of a march, not identifying it as an

7

S

armed march or any sort of march of force or violence > into

9

Washington and then into two Southern States — incidentally,

10

raising Federal questions, perhaps, rather than internal State

11

questions.

12

Another film taken is inside a house —

13

Q

There were guns in this first movie,

14

A

There were guns in both films.

15

Q

In both of them, were there?

IS

A

In both films there were guns.

17

It is also to be noted that the film was taken on a

18

remote private farm in which apparently there is no evidence

19

whatsoever that these people were not invitees present on that

20

farm by authority of the ownership of the farm.
There was nothing, nothing adduced.

21

An indictment was

22

returned.

After some preliminary maneuvering, including a

23

frontal attack upon the constitutionality of the statute, the

24

ease came on to trial.

25

in question.

The State produced nothing but the film

The only other evidence that the State produced
4

1

was basically geared to identifying the personnel involved in

2

the film? in other words, showing that the man Brandenburg had

3

a gun similar to the guns in the film, and that he had markings

4

on his person similar to the markings and that his voice was

5

similar.

6

Other than this,, the State offered nothing.
It is critical that the State offered nothing on the

7

nature and history of the Klan.

8

course of the Klan9s history, any continuing historical or ex-

9

part opinions concerning any possible commitment to violence.

It offered nothing showing the

I©

It offered nothing on the continuing organization of the Klan,

13

nothing whatsoever.

12

13
14

It offered nothing other than the film itself and the
words intrinsic in the film itself.
The State then rested.

The defense --in which I was

IS

not involved? I am appointive counsel, appointed for purposes of

16

appeal — made a motion for dismissal at that time.

17

frankly admit that the motion for dismissal which was made by

18

then counsel was simply a weight of evidence motion, and he did

19

not specifically denote the constitutional question that had

£0

arisen at that point in the presentation of the State's case.

Zi

I suggest that it is completely immaterial that he did not.

22

I will

The defense then proceeded forward and offered basic­

23

ally a defense of depositive testimony in which various officers

24

of the Klan testified as to their ostensible peaceful purposes

25

ana things of this sort, and the historical evaluations of the
5

1

2

presence of weapons and the burning of a cross»
The Court then charged the jury»

The Court9s charge

3

to the jury — and I specifically ask this Court to consider it

4

carefully — begins in the appendix, page 72, and met with a

5

statute that thrusts itself clearly within the First Amendment,

6

makes on its face no attempt to give us an indication of a line

7

of demarcation between the mere abstract teaching and advocacy,

8

or even advocacy in. relation to a clear and present danger as to

9

advocacy in a hypothetical sense that in no way on its face

10

does this, the Court perpetuated the evil of the statute by

11

making the charge even more general, in which he indeed defined

12

the term raadvocacy” as involving intrinsic in it, in his own

1.3

charge, teaching»

14
15
16
17
18

So we had at this point a man who had been tried with
none of the safeguards of the First Amendment applied to the
trial of his cause, to the measure of his evidence, or to the
instructions to those who were to be the triers of the fact
which would demarcate a point at which the First Amendment would

19

be operative in relation to what happened on that isolated farm

20

on that isolated day,

21

Q

How large was this meeting?

22

A

The testimony and the pictures indicated that per
•i

23
24
25

haps 20 persons were involved,
Q

Any spectators?

A

No spectators,

All were participants in the

meeting»

There is some indication in the record that there were;

2

ho womenfolk in the picture or in the meeting.

testimony in the record that one of the TV reporters said he

4

heard women's voices in another room,

Q

Is the film an exhibit?

9

A

The film is an exhibit,

10

Q

It is her® in the Court, is it?

11

A

I pray it is,

I have ordered it and the last

12

word from the clerk was that they were having trouble finding

13

it but they would find it and send it on up here,

14

pray, because we do have in this case some issues as to what is

IS

shown in the film.
Q

18

17

Is there a dispute between the parties hare as

to whether there was or was not a call to engage in violence?
.

IS

A

Yes,

19

Q

Thez-e is a dispute,

20

A

There is a distinct dispute.

22

£4
25

I devoutly

u
It is our contention

that there was nothing in this speech, which is part of the
record, and as shown in th© film, and since the State limited
itself to this, there is nothing in it that is a call to vioXence.
Q

And your adversary disputes that?
7

1

A

1 assume my adversary disputes that.

2

0

The State9s whole case was the film, plus the

3

identification of the defendant as the person shown in the film;

4

is that right,?

3

A

That is correct. The language in the film is

6

actually in both parties8 briefs.

The difference between us is

7

that they tend to ascribe certain slogans by the persons milling

8

about to the given defendant.

9

that, the given defendant uttered were the formal, set speeches,

We contend that the only words

This film was shown over a local television sta­

tion and then over a network, wasnBt it?
A

This film was shown a local television station

and a network,
Q

And a network.

That is correct.

Q

Who was the Trial Judge in this case?

A

0’udge Simon Lease.

18

Q

Does it ring any bells, Mr. Justice?

Q

Yes, it does.

Mr. Brown, I gather the indictment, however, was

for the events, is that right, the events depicted in the film,
not for the exhibition of the film, was it?
A
Q

That is correct.
In other words, all the film was in evidence for

was depicting what happened on a certain day.

Q

So that I gather if we? are to read the record of

the case, we have to see the film, don't we, to know what the
truths were?
A

Precisely.

As a matter of fact, in the Supreme

12

Court of Ohio — we didn't raise it here, because we wanted to

13

make sure we would get cert

14

the same position as a. book in an obscenity case.

we asserted that the film was in

IS

Q

That doesn't help you.

16

A

I know it doesn't help us now, but at that point

17

whan we were before the Supreme Court of Ohio, we asserted that,

18

saying that the film in and of itself is the entire contest of

19

the alleged offense.

20

Q

I don't understand your point that nobody but the

21

audience was being, members of the group, were being addressed.

22

1 don't see the relevance.

23
24
25

i

The reason X ask that is that in the Dennis case,
Dennis versus the United States, involving the prosecution of
.Communist teachers who taught the Marxist creed, nobody was
9

I

1

2

exposed except the students in the classroom»
A

May it please the Court, there is this important

3

distin.ct.ion to be made between the Dennis case and that case;

4

In the Dennis case, the teachers who taught these classes, this

5

was evidence within a total context of a total conspiratorial

6

activity leading to a total action result.

7

In this instance, the State contented itself merely

8

with showing a given speech and did not choose to present any

9

evidence to make it part of a conspiratorial whole.

10
11

12

It took the

speech in and of itself and presented only that.
Q

That is why I asked you earlier, the indictment

was for the events depicted.

13

A

That is correct.

14

Q

Sot for the showing of the motion picture in con­

15
16
17
18
13
20
21

22
23
24
25

text of a. conspiracy or anything else.

It is just what happened

on that particular day.
A

That is correct? what happened on that farm on

that day, and that is the important distinction to be made.
Q

Did this defendant have anything to do with

arranging for the events to be televised?
A

There is evidence in the record that indicates

that his was the voice that called the radio-TV announcer.
Q

Well, if that is so, then it is debatable whether

this was addressed only to the people who were physically there.
A

That may be the case, Justice Portas.
10

However,

i

the State of Ohio chose not to charge him for that.

2
3
2

Q

If he had arranged for it to be televised, pre­

sumably he intended that his remarks reach a larger audience.

\

4

A

It is quite potentially possible.

however, what the State chose to charge him with.

7

Q

This is not,
Read the

\

».
If the Court took notice that the Communist Party

8

was conspiratorial and out to conquer the world, why coaidn't

9

the Court take notice that the Klan was up to no good?

10

A

In the Dennis case, I submit that the Court did

!1

not take such judicial notice.

12

of fact, there was the adoption of evidence to show that.
Q

13
14

In the Dennis case, as a matter

We may be taking some liberties with the record

in the Dennis case.
A

IS

In any event, it is true that in the Dennis case

IS

there was additional evidence over and above that adduced in

17

this case.

18

They showed no other plan or purposivity other than this,

19

j

In this case they showed nothing but the film itself

Q

So you ask us to deal with this case as if it

20

were just a group of school boys, hooded school boys, sitting in

21

a room listening to —

22

A

That is a potential distinction between this

23

case and the Dennis case, as well.

rather silly characters.

:

These are paltry unknowns,

In the Dermis case we are dealing with

This doss

make a difference in relation to the rights prevailing under the

2

First Amendment.
There are other distinctions which I will pass to in

3

,

4

a moment

5

which, on its very face, thrusts itself into the First Amendmentj,

6

We are dealing in this situation not with an address to an evil j

7

from which we must move back to a possible restraint on the Firs r.

8

Amendment.

9

right,, and then a proscription upon the right as it might en­

10

but in this given case we are dealing with a statute

We are dealing with an entry particularly into the

gender an evil.
For instance, the statute itself starts off, "No per­

11

!2

son shall, by word of mouth or writing, advocate or teach the

13

duty” and goes on from that point»

14

here we come."

15

cate or teach the duty and necessity or propriety of crime»

It denotes "First Amendment,

It does not say that no person shall not advo­
It

does not then become so broad that it could possibly taka symbolic
16
17

acts, or acting out that goes beyond mere words of mouth and

18

printing»

1©
20

It announces boldly, "Here we come, First Amendment,"
/•
and proceeds from that point on.
Advocate or teach.

Now, the prosecution in this case

21

has said that the issue of "teach" is not involved hex*e because

22

the man was charged only under "advocacy".

23
24
25

But if the distinc­

tions between "teaching" and "advocacy" are so simplistic, we
would have a very simple solution to this case.

But as a teacher

who teaches in the first grade that the American Revolution was

12

s
2

a noble thing, is she merely teaching, or is she advocating?
The lines of demarcation between "teaching” and "advo

3

cacy" are so difficult that they leave us vulnerable when we

4

charge "advocacy" alone.
'

S

In order to reserve a portion of my time for rebuttal,'

8

I would like to point out, however, what I think is the most

7

absurd aspect of this particular statute.

8
9

It also forbids not only speech or printing.

It be­

comes very, very evasive on the whole question of intent,

19

scienter and mens rea.

11

very unclear on the whole area of willfulness, except for an

12

occasional phrase in its multiplicity of phrases, in addition to

13

which it forbids the assembly with any group.

14

Read it carefully.

It becomes very,

It forbids not only membership, a problem that has

IS

been before this Court, not only affiliation, a problem in this \

16

Court, but it even forbids sitting down with such a group.

17

In

\

an era when we are trying to preserve the dialogue benefits to

;

18

society of the First Amendment, it is incredible that the Legis­

19

lature of Ohio forbids even to sit down.
*

.

20

Q

Well I gather, Mr. Brown, that apart from your

n

argument addressed to the statute itself, divorced from the

22

actual prosecution, you do argue, don't you, that the First

23
24
25

Amendment considerations are so close to the surface in a pro­
secution under such a statute that at the very least it required
an instruction which was not given here.
13
!

t

A

That is correct

2

Q

And if we agree with you on that score, I gather

3

we don’t, have to reach the question of the constitutionality of

4

the statute itself, do we?

You would rather we did,

5

A

I certainly would prefer that you did

Q

Blit we don't have to, if we strike it down on

7

instruction, do we?
A

8
9

This Court could potentially strike this down

not merely on the instruction, but, indeed, on the face of the

10

record that it is not constitutionally sufficient to constitute

11

an offense.

to advocate violence to redress abuses of law.

I have cited various authorities relative to
I believe that the basic

.xtfas presented to the jury to determine whether, dr not there was j
j

sufficient evidence upon which a jury could return a verdict.

23

I believe that in this case, when counsel says sending

24

the Jews back to Israel? let’s give them back to the dark garden

25

that this might not involve violence, I would like him, perhaps
19

!

in his reply* to explain how the statement "Bury the niggers”

2

would not constitute a violent form of action.
In this case there is two basic parts of the film,

3

4

one that was taken inside of a room in x<?hich the defendant,

5

Clarence Brandenburg, was identified, and I don’t believe there

6

is any question in the record either between the appellant and

7

the appellee in this matter relative to his identification as he

9

10

hundreds, hundreds of members throughout the State," and so

forth.

We

Then there is a second portion of the film in which

12,
13

a group of people are walking or marching around a burning

14

cross, hooded, armed, shouting profanities, in which there is a

15

question of whether or not the defendant himself said the words

IS

attributed to him in the transcript and on page 5, "How far is

17

the nigger going to — yeah," "Send the Jews back to Israel/'

18

and so forth, with the other profanities.
There is some evidence in the transcript itself which

19

20
;ai

22
;23

24
:25

could indicate, as a jury sitting and listening in, that the
defendant himself made one or more of these statements, and I
apologize to the Court for not having this as part of my brief.
I notified counsel of the possibility of my bringing this matter
up.
Ohio hate a section in its code, Ohio Revised Code,
20

?•

Section 1.17, which provides:

a

■"Any person who aids, abets or procures another to

3

commit an offense stay be prosecuted as if he were the

4

principal offender,”

5

We have a group of people marching around, as an

3

organisers8 meeting, toward the acts of violence, an end that

?

they had attributed and desired the suppression of the Negro.

8

Q

3

A

What was the sisa of this group of people?
With the Court’s permission, at the time of the

10

marching around, the cross, the sise was approximately 10 to 20,

11

as counsel for appellant has statesd.

'.Is there anything in the record that shows that

more people were involved at any time?

Yes, sir.

things?

If Your Honor please, I believe we have to take

the entire actions of the defendant himself

that we cannot

10

station for the purpose of having a television cameraman and

11

newsman out at that meeting to take pictures, to put it out over

12

the television station.
So when we say there are 10 or 20 people at this meet­

13
14

ing, I don’t think we can limit ourselves to just those 10 or

15

20 people.

16

this defendant, to broadcast this, as it appears to me, and upon

17

which a jury could determine these profanities, whatever you

18

would want to call them, across a large segment of the community

I

19
,20

121
;22
;23
:24
<‘25

This is a plan, a concerted action on the part of

in Ohio, and subsequently, I might add, it was picked tap by a
network television,
I don’t think we can limit ourselves to just the 10
or 20 people, although# in and of itself I would say that the
statement such as this to 10 or 20 people, 10 or 20 people can
cause one heck of a lot of crime and violence and terrorism in
a community.

It only takes one person to cause it. But you get

22

1

10 or 20 with hoods, shotguns, rifles, and other things, saying

2

"Kill the niggers.

3

man back to Africa," et cetera, riding in a community, and I say

4

you can cause violence, crime and terrorism right at the start

5

with just two men, not 10 or 20 as the record indicates.

Send the Jews back to Israel.

Send the dark?

8

Q

Out in the country.

1

A

But the broadcast was not in the country.

8

The

broadcast was to the community locally.
Q

9

Except, Mr. Kirschner, the theory of the indict­

10

ment, as I read it, on page 2 of the appendix, is that these

11

people were charged with violating the statute by what they did

12

at that farm on Two Mile Road on that evening, not with anything

13

to do with the television broadcast.

14

ment?

IS

A

Have 1 misread the indict­

No, I would say that perhaps my interpretation .

IS

of it is different from Your Honor's.

As part of that meeting,

17

this man had set up right then and there a television cameraman.

j

18

His acts at that meeting were addressing not only the people who;
were standing in front of him, but the vast audience of the com-I

19
20

munity who would receive this broadcast by way of the television
!

21

22
23
24
25

communication, which ha himself has arranged and which the record
shows that he was the one who contacted the television station
to get them there in the first place.
So I would say yes, his acts at the scene? but I don't
think you can limit it to just the 10 or 20 people who were there

With the Court's permission, in the determination

With regard to that matter, with the Court * s permis­

left out that aspect of the charge in which the Court turned to

the defense counsel and specifically asked defendant’s attorney,

I gather these constitutional questions were

to your Supreme Court, were they?

With the Court5s permission, the constitutional

issue relative to the aspect of clear and present danger was

raised in the --

Well, may 1 ask this question;

10

Q

Was raised where?

11

A

I believe it was raised in the Supreme Court of

12

Ohio»

13

counsel, nor was 1 the appellant counsel»

14

I took the case on at that level»

Q

I know this —

I was not the trial

Well, may 1 ask, Mr. Kirschner, I am looking at

13

page 85, which is the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio»

16

What does this mean;

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

It says “The cause here on appeal as of

right was heard in the manner prescribed by law and no motion to
dismiss the appeal having been filed, the Court” — that is, the
Supreme Court — "sua sponte dismisses the appeal' for the reason
that no substantial constitutional question exists herein.”
Do I read this correctly if I suppose this means they
examined the record to see if any of the constitutional question:*;
asserted were substantial?
A

Let me give this aspect;

I cannot speak for the

Supreme Court of Ohio as to their interpretation of verbiage.

26

i

I can give this Court procedure»

z

The procedure in this matter is, defense* counsel filed

3

his appeal within time and as of right»

At that point, defense

4

counsel and the State appeared in Columbus, Ohio, at which time

5

the Court, through its representative, heard arguments both for j

6

and against the allowance —

Q

8

10

On these constitutional questions?
■i

On the constitutional question, by the Ohio

Supreme Court at that point»

Subsequent to that, the Court then/,

issued this ruling»
Q

11

Doesn8t this suggest that whatever the constitu­

12

tional ' questions that were raised, and I gather that you tell

13

me the clear and present danger was among them, was considered

14

and -decided?
S

15

A

Y$s, sir»

16

Q

Well, if that is so, what difference does it makei

i'
'

17

that no objection was taken to the charge?

If your Supreme

18
19

Court reached and decided these questions, then they are properly
'
here, if they overlooked the failure to take objection, aren't

20

they?

j

If Your Honor please, what I am saying is this:

21

22

The charge that the Court gave, insofar as it went, was not

23

incorrect»

24

"clear and present danger" did not make that charge void.

25

saying —

I am saying further that the absence of the verbiage

27

I am

<1■I

q

Suppose we disagree with that?

The problem isf

2

if we disagree with that, whether we can reach it in face of

3

the face that there was no objection,

4

judgment from the Supreme Court of Ohio, it considered and de­

5

cided the constitutional question.

®

stance, it is immaterial, isn’t it, that there was no objection

7

taken?

9
10

I suppose in that circum­

j
A

8

As I gather from this

I would say if you disagreed with the basic

premise that it is the duty of counsel to raise that objection
at the time, that the law of Ohio is incorrect.
Q

11

It isn’t that we disagree with the basic premise.

12

It is that that was not given as a reason by the Supreme Court

13

of Ohio not to decide the merits of the constitutional claim?

14

on the contrary, the Supreme Court of Ohio apparently did con­

15

sider and decide the constitutional question, notwithstanding

16

the failure to make objection.
If that is so, isn’t it so that the issue then is

17
18

properly before us?
A

19

With the Court’s permission, as I have indicated,

20

it is my humble belief that this is basically a State statute.

2?

If you determine the State statute is valid, you go to the evi­

22

dence.

23

should be thrown out is if there was no evidence upon which a

24

jury could have reached this finding, because the Court’s charge

25

that was given was specific enough and direct enough to cover'

I believe the evidence was there and the only way it

28

!

the clear and present danger, to cover all of the other aspects

2

of the case»
Q

3

1 take it that the State's position is that the

4

advocacy in the form that it took, demonstrated by this film,

5

constitutes a violation of the Criminal Syndicalism Act; is that

J6

right?

7

'V

A

I believe that the advocacy at the scene, which

0

was to be said to the members there, as well as the advocacy

9

which was planned to go out over the television network, con­

10

stituted a violation of the Ohio criminal syndicalism laws

11

insofar as the indictment charge, violence, or unlawful.methods

12

of terrorism.

13
14
15

Q

If that is so, were the network people, to use

that vague phrase, violating your law, too?
A

With due respect to the Court, in my humble

;

16

opinion I believe that the network people, in working with this •

17

advocacy, there has to be an intention.

If it can be shown

..

10

that they intentionally put this out over the television networks

19

with the thought of bringing violence or terrorism, then it is

20

my humble belief
'

21

22

that they may indicted the same as Clarence

*

Brandenburg was in this case, in violation of the Ohio laws.
Q

Is there any evidence in here other than the

23

film itself and the network arrangements that Mr. Brandenburg

24

intended to bring about violence?

25

A

I

If the Court please, I believe that the Court and
29
i

1

the jury may look to the words itself, the surrounding aspects.

2

As Your Honor in a reference that you recently wrote on civil

3

disobedience and civil disorder stated, even if what is said

4

does not create a clear and present danger — and I believe it

5

was a clear and present danger at that time -- of physical injury

6

to others, the place where the speech is uttered, the sise of

7

the crowd, and the circumstances, may convert the lawful into

8

the unlawful.

9

It is my humble belief that the circumstances — if

10

this was on a rural farm where nobody was around, nobody would

11

hear this except perhaps five people in a little circle, and

12

Clarence Brandenburg was never tied in, the defendant in this

13

case, to the propagation of these epithets, derogatory state­

14

ments, or call them what you raay, through the television networks,

15

I say the State of Ohioss case would be substantially weakened.

IS

But in this case it is not someone else contacting

17

the television networks.

18

contacts the television newsman himself, requesting that they

19

have a man there to take his picture making certain statements

20
21

22
23
24
25

It is Clarence Brandenburg himself who

and to take his group, of which he is the leader and organizer,
and propagating these statements to the general public in the
Cincinnati area.
Q

I suppose it can be said that there is no ques­

tion that he intended to advocate whatever he advocated here.
But the next question is, do you have to have some additional
30

1

proof to the effect that he also intended that steps be taken

£

to carry out this program with respect to the Negroes and the

3

JawSj and so on, that he described»

4

A

With the Court's permission, it is my humble

5

belief that you do not have to have anything further»

6

to go —■ and I use this as an extreme statement

7

to run down Harlem, shall we say, and say, “Bury the Negroes»

8

Sand them back to black Africa" —

9

Q

You wouldn't last very long»

10

A

Probably so. Your Honor,

if I were

but if I were

If I were to go to

11

Israel and say the same thing, about sending the Jews to the

12

Arab countries, or something, or to any other — I don't say

13

they are derogcitory, but I say that because these are the two

14

groups that the defendant has picked upon in his derogatory

15

statements — I say the very words themselves indicate

16

Q

Well, those words were carried on the network»

17

Why wasn't that a violation of your law?

18

I started with»

19

A

That is the question

As I indicated, with the Court’s permission, it

20

is my humble belief that in addition there must be an intention

21

to cause the violence, the terrorism»

22

Q

That is right.

I will ask. you again whether them

23

is any proof of that other than the utterance of the words and

24

the arrangement for the network?

25

A '

Other than the defendant’s actions, which I believe
31

1

Indicate his intention, there is no other proof»

didn't they?
A

10

1967, if 1 am not mistaken, and 1968» However,

there was at the time unrest.

There were marches at the time,

nature at that time in Cincinnati, but in the nature of riots,

of that nature, no, Your Honor»

Mr, Brown, I dpn8t suppose whatever it is you

12

and Mr. Kirschner submitted to the Supreme Court of Ohio is in

13

the record before us yet, is it?
A

14

In view of the fact, Your Honor, of the amazing

15

circumstances, in ray opinion., that I did not get allowance into

18

the Supreme Court of Ohio, I, in ordering my certification of

17

record to this Court, asked specifically that the briefs sub­

18

mitted to the Supreme Court of Ohio —-

1'
■
.

19

Q

So they are probably here.

20

A

So they are within the possession of the Clerk

Q

Have you any recollection whether the State raised

2!

22

here.

23

a question of failure to object to the instructions as one

24

reason that the issue --

25

A

The State has not, until we appeared here, if I
33

1

2
3
4

am correct, ever raised the question of failing to object»

Q

How do you interpret that judgment of the Supreme

Court of Ohio?
A

May it please the Court, if the Court is aware

5

of the procedures and the entries of the Supreme Court of Ohio ,

6

the Supreme Court of Ohio? if it is ruling that a constitutional

7

question has not been raised, will deny the motion to dismiss t'h<:

Q

appeal as of right with the following language;

9
10

11
12

"A constitutional question having not bean timely
raised, the same is dismissed.”
If the constitutional question has been properly raised,
it will use the language in the entry before you.
Q

13

I see.

That is to say, then, in your view, that

14

judgment should be considered as a determination on the merits

15

of the constitutional question.

16

A

That is correct.

Q

You mention in your brief, I think, Mr. Brown,

that the reason there was no opinion in the Court of Appeals in

Q

In Ohio, does everybody know who has been

assigned an opinion to write?
A

12

No, It was only in this instance, Your Honor,

13

that there had been approximately a year's delay after the sub­

14

mission to the Appellate Court,

13

late Court asking why, and at that time the Judge informally

indicated that the man who had been assigned the opinion had

17

recently, unfortunately, died, and that is how that came to

What was the sentence in this case?

A

The sentence was one to ten years.
