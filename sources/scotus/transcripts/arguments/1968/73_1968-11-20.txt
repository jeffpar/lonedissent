THE CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

No. 73, Robert Newton

Mr. Rickershauser.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES E. RICKERSHAUSER, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. RICKERSHAUSER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

3

the Court, this is a case involving a right of an indigent Cali­

9

fornia prisoner to a free copy of the transcript of his hearing

10

on a petition of habeas corpus in the California Superior Court.

11

That petitioner alleged insufficient access to legal materials

12

and to the courts.

13

The issue in this case is whether under the facts of

14

the case petitioner can obtain an adequate appellate review con­

IS

sistent with due process and equal protection under the Cali­

IS

fornia habeus corpus procedures where a nonindigent prisoner

17

could have purchased this transcript.

18

cedures in California relating to habeas corpus cases are not

19

conditioned as a matter of law on the availability of that

20

transcript.

21

But the appellant pro­

Following the hearing, the Superior Court denied the

22

petitioner's petition for a write of habeas corpus.

23

then filed a written motion for a free transcript, alleging his

24

lack of funds, his need for the transcript to prove his claims

25

in the California Su preme Court and to assist him in the
2

Petitioner

1

2

preparation of his case.
Petitioner did not then and does not now complain

3

about the hearing but instead contends the evidence will prove

4

his habeas corpus contentions.

5

Petitioner in his motion raised the Federal questions

6

presented here, citing authorities.

7

that motion by written order, stating, among other things, that

3

none of the proceedings in that court would be of concern to the

9

California appellate courts.

10

The Superior Court denied

Petitioner sought review of that denial of his motion

11

for a free transcript by petitioning for a writ of certiorari

12

in the California Court of Appeals, which was denied.

13

tioner then sought a hearing in the California Supreme Court,

14

which was denied.

13

Peti­

Both of these denials were without opinion.

Petitioner then petitioned this court for a writ of

16

certiorari, which was granted after a response was filed by the

17

State of California upon request.

22

tions for habeas corpus to the California appellate courts, this

court, and, if necessary, the lower Federal courts, that peti­

24

tioner is here seeking.

25

This court then appointed

It is a tran­

It seems clear under various decisions of this court,
3

1

the most recent and prominent one of which is Long versus Dis­

2

trict Court, 385 U.S. 192, that if the California habeas corpus

Li

procedure was a traditional appellate procedure, equal protec­

4

tion would require that this transcript be furnished to peti­

5

tioner so that he could have the same means of pursuing his

6

remedies as a man with means to purchase the transcript.

7

The difference, if any, in this case is that habeas

8

corpus in California is termed as a theoretical matter to be an

9

original writ procedure in each of the courts of California.

10

Q

That is theoretical?

That is a fact, isn’t it?

11

In other words, it may work to the benefit of the applicant,

12

because if this is not an appeal but rather an original, new

13

application for habeas corpus in the second court, then the

14

applicant is free to bring in additional material which he

IS

would not normally be free to do if this were simply a review

18

of the District Court’s action?

17

A

That is true, Mr. Justice Stewart, but in prac­

13

tice it seems to me we have to look at the California procedure

19

and see how it usually works.

20

late procedure in the usual case.

21

petitioner has shown his need for that transcript to prepare

22

for the appellate court review.

23
24
25

It usually works like an appel­
Even, if it isn't, I think the

If I might, I would like to point out that even though
the petitioner is theoretically able to proceed in either the
Superior Court or the appellant courts of California in an
4

1

original proceedings as a general matter and the usual practice

2

is as established in the State's brief hare as referred to, is

3

that the appellate courts will require him to start in the trial

court.

o

i*i

Q

That is not unlike the Federal system, I expect,

Q

A

That is right.

7

Q

I think 1 am right in saying that under the

3

statutes an

9

either in the Federal district court or before a circuit judge

original write of habeas corpus can be brought

10

or the whole court of appeals or before any justice or before

11

this whole court.

13

tions filed with the circuit judges or supreme court justices

to the district court.

A

16

But the practice is, and it is authorised by

Is that more or less the California

I believe the more common practice is to deny

17

the application for habeas corpus.

IS

note in the State's brief on the ground that he should proceed

19

in the trial court absent some unusual circumstances that the

20

trial court would not act on.
Q

21

It is referred to in a foot­

Of course, in the Federal system, there is pro­

22

vision for appeals from denials of habeas corpus.

A

As I under­

There is an appeal by the State if a petition is

granted.

"5

Q

a

No? an appeal from the denial of habeas corpus,

Is that correct?

3

A

That is correct.

However, many times the subse­

4

quent proceedings in the appellate court have the same effect

3

as an appeal before the appellate courts,, which often limit

S

their review to the record before the trial court.

7

that was asked here, since -there was no complaint about the

8

hearing in the trial court or that it was insufficient or that

9

additional evidence would be required in the appellate court,
Q

to

That was all

As I read your trial judge's order, he made clear

n

that the appellate court, if it was so minded, was free to ask

12

for the transcript of what had gone on in the habeas corpus

13

proceeding© in the tidal court.
A

14

Didn't I read that correctly?

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

The appellate
I

court could have ordered that transcript.

IS

Our position is that in order to get the appellate

16
17

court to take the case, it is essential to this indigent peti­

18

tioner to have that transcript available both in aid of prepara-j

19

tion of his case and in establishing his case at the discretion

20

of the appellate court to take it or not.

21

22

Which transcript was it necessary for him to have?

A

The transcript on a hearing for the petition of

habeas corpus in the trial court.

23
24

Q

Q

You are not asking that the State supply a tran­

'

25

script of the original trial?
6

1

A

No, sir»

This petition for habeas corpus con­

2

tended that he was denied sufficient access to the court and to

3

legal materials which, had it been established, 1 assuiae would

4

have then proceeded to attack his prior conviction and when he

5

is in on two different crimes, one of which he pleased guilty to.

6

Q

Mr*. Rickershauser, do you know whether 'this pro­

7

cedure that Brother Stewart was talking about is peculiar to

B

California, whether there are other States and,if so, how many

9

that have this same procedure; that is to say, that don't permit

10

appeals in postconviction proceedings but that do provide for

11

original proceedings in the superior courts?

12

A

I am sorry, Mr. Justice Fortas.

13

answer to that question.

14

desire me to do so»

I don't know the

I will attempt to supply it if you

15

Q

I would be interested in having that, yes.

16

A

All right.

17

It seems, from the original common law practice, that

18

it is reasonable to suppose that it exists in other States, but

19

I can't actually answer the question.

20
21

Q

I gather, from what you say, that sometimes there

are hearings in the supreme court.

22

A

That is correct.

23

Q

When you file a new petition in the supreme court

24
25

instead of appealing, sometimes there is a hearing.
A

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.

Why wouldn't you, if they wouldn't give you the

transcript of what occurred in the lower court, ask for a hear­

3

ing so you could make a record and put the evidence before the

4

Supreme Court of California?

3

A

We would ask for a hearing»

6

Q

Are you claiming the constitutional right not to

7

have to ask for that hearing?
A

8
9

No.

I am claiming that in order to get that

hearing, it is necessary to have this transcript.

10

Q

Why is that?

11

A

Both in aid of preparation of the petition for

12

the hearing and in proving to the court—Q

I believe the

Court could take notice of the fact that two other petitions
for certiorari are pending in this court at this time relating

21
to the subsequent proceedings in this petitioner's attempt to
22
obtain habeas corpus»

I thought that is what we had before us

It is really arguable, I guess, what you have

before you because the petitioner took that denial to the
California Court of Appeal by writ of certiorari and then took
that to the Supreme Court of California by petition for
hearing, both of which were denied.

He then came here for a

writ of certiorari, which was granted, directed to the Superior
10
Court of California, although we have treated it in the brief
1?

tz

as directed to the Supreme Court.

I think it would lie to

another court.

IS
Subsequently, he has pursued his habeas corpus
14
remedies in the California Appellate Court and has filed
15
petitions for certiorari.

That is not this case.

Those cases

16
are pending here.
17
Q

But this case is an attack, is it not, upon the

18
denial of the trial court of a request for a free transcript
19
of the habeas corpus proceedings in the trial court to be used j
20
by your client, which he says is necessary for him to have, in
21
order to file an application for habeas corpus in the Appellate

22
Court?
23
A

That is correct.

24
I was discussing the fact that the California

procedure has developed appellate similarities»

We think the basic considerations underlying the
transcript cases are that an indigent prisoner is to be
afforded an adequate means of review in the appellate courts
as a man with means would require the furnishing of this
transcript»
It seems to us that the facts of this case uniquely
demonstrate the essential aspect of this transcripto

This

petitioner in his habeas corpus petition is asking or claiming
that he is denied access to the courts»

This is obviously a

problem with complexity in which the courts must, weigh his
liberty and his rights against the right of the institutional
authorities to run the prisoner,, a complex problem»
It is almost unbelievable that a man who had means
would not purchase the transcript of this hearing in the trial
court in order to assist him in the preparation of his papers
in the appellate courts and also to demonstrate to the appellat e
courts how it is that he was denied access, which would

-

1
£

certainly be of assistance to a court in determining whether
or not there was the kind of denial of access that would be a
deprivation of his rights.
So it is our view*, therefore* that there is the kind i

it?

Suppose evidence has to be taken?

Does the court hear
Do they ever take

evidence before the court?
A

My understanding is that a master is appointed

or a referee and that a transcript is obtained of that
proceedings, which is then reviewed by the court to the extent
necessary to reach a decision.
Q

They don't customarily then rely on the

17
transcript of the lower courts?
18

|

A

There are Court of Appeal cases in which they

19
20

have relied on it.

I am sure they would in this case had they

granted a hearing, because the petitioner doesn't seek to
21

establish anything beyond that transcript.

This isn't a case

22
where he is asking for the transcript in order to comb it for
23

errors that he might then urge in an appellate court.
24
But there is obviously some speculation as to what
25

they would do»

1

I would like to mention one or two of the state's

2
3

contentions, the first one of which seems to be that there are

4

not sufficient allegations of need for the transcript»

5

feel that a layman with a problem such as this, trying to

6

establish that he doesn’t have adequate access to the courts,

We

\

when on the face of it he is in court, has alleged all that any

7

layman ought to have to allege in expressing his need for this

8

transcript, especially when he contends that he is willing to

©

rely on it and that he had a fair hearing in that trial court»

10

Q

11

I am. confused as to what is here»

at the appendix, page 22.

12

1 am looking

That apparently is the order in the

Supreme Court of California, entitled "Petition for Hearing,"

13
14

"Order Denying Hearing," "Petition for Hearing Denied»”

And

yet our writ at page 63 runs not to that order of the Supreme

15

Court of California but apparently to the Superior Court of

16

California»

17

A

18
19

1 think I mentioned a few moments ago that it is

not actually clear from an arguable standpoint as to what is

'

20
21

22
23
24
25

here.

It is true that the writ does run to the Superior Court

in the State of California.
Q

May I just ask there, looking at page 50, that

would appear to be to the denial of the petition for writ of
certiorari — is that it?

~~ in the District Court, because

at page 52 the order seems to be "Petition for Writ of
13

Certiorari Denied.”
A

That is the order of the Court of Appeals»

Q

Is that what this ran to, to that order and not

on the order of page 62 of the Supreme Court of California?
A

Mr» Justice Brennan, your writ ran to the order

of the Superior Court on page 43 of the appendix»
Q

Is that denying a transcript?

A

That is correct»

Q

You appealed that order?

A

That was taken to the Court of Appeals in

California by a writ of certiorari under the procedures of
that state of which there is no decision establishing that it
is either the incorrect or correct procedure»

It was then

taken to the California Supreme Court»
Q

That is where you asked for a hearing in the

Supreme Court?
A

That is right»

Q

That is like petitioning for a writ of

certiorari to the Supreme Court of California?
A

I am sorry.

We asked for t?ae supplying of the

transcript below, and I assume there would be a hearing.

The

procedure in the California Supreme Court is a petition for a
hearing which has the discretionary aspects of the petiton for
certiorari here.
Q

In other words, this is not something ~ that

You didn't mislead.

It is just those labels.

a procedure for the Supreme Court of California under a

Court and of the Sxipreme Court,

19
Mr, Justice Brennan* if the order of the Superior Court was the
20

last order possible in the state court system.

If it was a

21
final judgment of the final court, our view is that is not the

22
case because it could have been taken up in certiorari.

The Attorney General questions that in his brief.

That is correct»

I don't think there is any

That, is correct.

I was discussing the state's contention as to the
specificity of the allegations.

I think the final state's

point that I 'would like to discuss is that the decisions of
this court in the transcript cases talk about the state may
provide adequate alternatives.

The difficulty I have with

that here is that there is no adequate alternative that we are
able to determine and none has been offered.

The only discus­

sion of any is that the Petitioner alleged with particularity
what happened at the hearing.
This, 1 think, is an undue burden upon him, one that
a man with means would not assume? and that, therefore, there
is the kind of discrimination without alternatives that the
18

That is right.

The focux of the court is to

review the proceedings below to determine whether or not there
was error.

In order to do that, you look at the transcript.
However, in California we have an entirely different

procedure, where the proceedings below are entirely tangential
and collateral,

There the court doesn’t necessarily review

the proceeding below.

It receives allegations from the
20

petitioner, and it tests those allegations to determine their
sufficiency»

Because of that, because the court relies on

allegations, it does not necessarily need a transcript to
resolve the issue»
There is another aspect of this difference also.
The habeas corpus procedure has multiple stages»

The first

After that, the court gets into

the process of determining the truth of the allegations if it
has not denied the petition.

But this right of the transcripts has not been

expanded in accordance with that procedure?

This is an unusual

situation because between the time that the petition was pre­

I think that the State Supreme Court could have
