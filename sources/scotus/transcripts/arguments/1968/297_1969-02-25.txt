ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. CONNOLLY, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

14

MR. CONNOLLY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

IS

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General.

16

If it please the Court, this case arises under the

17

immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.

18

writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit

19

to review that court's interpretation of the Act’s provisions

20

governing the temporary landing of alien crewmen for shore

21

leave while their vessels call United States ports.

22

The case is here in

Before setting forth the facts of this case I would

23

like briefly to outline the statutory provisions which this

24

case involves.

25

In parts 4 and 5 of the Immigration and Nationality
2

1

political opinion»
Under the regulations issued by the Attorney General

2
3

that determination under Section 243(h) is initially made by

4

the special inquiry officer who conducts the deportation pro-

5

ceeding under Section 242.
In Part 6 of the Immigration and Nationality Act

8
7

Congress established special procedures for the admission and

8

in some cases for the expulsion of alien crewmen.

9

Section 252(a) of the Act, which is the exclusive procedure

Under

10

for the temporary admission of alien crewmen. Congress provided

11

that an immigration officer may in his discretion issue a

12

temporary permit for the alien crewmen to land, if he finds that!

13

the alien is a bona fide crewman and if he finds under sub-

14

section Ad of 252 that the alien intends to depart on the

15

vessel in which he arrives, and the permit issued under sub.
r
section A.l is good for the period during which the alien
*

10
17
18

19

20
21
22
23
24
25

crewman's vessel is in port.
The section further provides that the alien crewman
must agree to accept such a permit which is conditioned -upon
his being deported from the United States as provided in
subsection B of the statute.

That section, subsection B,

provides that if an immigration officer determines that the
alien no longer intends to depart on the vessel in which he
.

arrived the -immigration officer may take up and revoke the
permit, take the crewman into custody and if practicable,
4

1

remove him to the vessel ih which he arrived for removal from

2

the United States on board that vessel,

I
3

The Acre provides that the alien crewman shall be

4

deported from the United States at the expense of the transpor­

5

tation law which brought him.
The last section of Section 252(b) is particularly

6

■

7

important in this case.

It provides that nothing in this

8

section shall be construed to require the procedure prescribed
.

9

in Section 242 of the Act the hearing before a. special inquiry

10

officer to cases falling within the provisions of this sub­

11

section.

12

13
14

Section 252(a) and (b)

j

are set out on page 41 and 42

of the Government's brief.
Regulations issued by the Attorney General dealing

15

with alien crewmen also provide for the parole of an alien

16

crewman who alleges that he may be persecuted if he returns to

17

his homeland, thus reflecting the discretionary relief available,

13

under Section 243(h) of the Act,

19

In this case, Respondent, a native and citizen of

20

Yugoslavia arrived in this country shortly before Christmas

21

in' 1964, as the member of a crew, radio officer, of a Yugoslavia:'
i
vessel.

22
23
24
25

He was issued a conditional landing permit xmder
Section 252(a) of the Act good through the time that his vessel
remained in the Port in Oregon and on condition that Respondent

5

1
2

He went ashore on January 4th, 1965, and he went

3

directly to the home of a cousin in the company of another

4

crewman on board that ship and a day later they both returned

5

to the Immigration Office in Portland, Oregon, I believe, and

6

claimed — sought asylum in the United States on the ground

7

that they would be persecuted if they were returned to Yugoslavi a

a
9

On representations which Respondent made to the
Inmigration Officer at that time that hewould not under any

10

circumstances return to his ship, his conditional landing

11

permit was revoked and he was detained at the Office.

12

On the following day the District Director gave

13

Respondent an opportunity to present a statement and evidence

14

in support of his claim that he would be persecuted if he were

15

returned to Yugoslavia,

10

set out, it is Regulation 253,1(f) now and it is set out on

17
18

i

leave the United States with the ship*

This was under the regulation which is

page 46 of the Government's brief.
Upon advice of counsel, Respondent refused to give

19

any evidence or make any statement in support of his claim.

20

contended that he had a right to a hearing before a special

a.

inquiry officer under 242(b) for his claim of anticipated

22
23
24
25

He

persecution under 243(h) and he said that he wouldn't give any
evidence to the District Director at that time.
Consequently, the District Director, without any
evidence in support of the claim denied the application for
6

1

parole and ordered that Respondent be removed to his ship.,
Respondent then brought suit into the District Court

2
3

of Oregon to enjoin the District Director from removing him

to his ship»

record exactly what the basis is.

intended, to present .
We can assume that it would be somewhat of a time-'
consuming procedure, how long 1 can't estimate„
Q

Would it be enough time so it would not be

possible to get him back on his own ship?

6

A

Conceivably it would be.

7

The supplement the Government provided the record

8

shows his ship sailed from Oregon some time after the 7th and

9

sailed from somewhere in California for Italy around, the 16th.

10

So we just don't really know whether it would have been possible

11

to hold such a hearing.

12

Q

May I ask, Mr. Connolly, if he had not had a

1.3

permit but had jumped ship and his ship was still in the harbor

14

when they picked him up, in that circumstance if he had made

15

this persecution claim would he have been entitled to a

16

hearing before a hearing examiner, rather than before the

17

District Director?

18

A

My understanding, Mr. Justice, would be that

19

under the Act he would not be subject to Section 252(b), but

20

that he must be proceeded against on the grounds stated in 241

21

and under the proceeding in Section 242(b).

22
23
24

25

Q

So that getting the permit he gets only a summary

hearing on the persecution claim whereas if he hadn't gotten
the permit he would have had the hearing before the hearing
examiner, is that right?
9

1

A

That is right, Mr, Justice,

2

I intend to deal with that question later on as to

3

whether the discrimination between a crewman who gets a permit

4

and a crewman who jumps ship makes any sense at all,
Q

5
6

on another ship, he gets a full hearing?
A

7
8

Isn't it also true if he says he is going back

That is right, Mr, Justice,

And I also intend

to deal with that form of discrimination.
To continue on with the facts, after the District

8
10

Director denied his claim for parole he sued to enjoin the

11

District Director from removing him to his ship.

12

Court -- and claimed at that time also that he had the right to

13

a hearing before a special inquiry officer — the District

14

Court denied his claim that he had a right to a hearing before

15

a special inquiry officer but remanded the case back to the

16

District Director for the taking of evidence, an opportunity

17

which Respondent accepted at this time, presented his evidence.
The evidence presented the District Director found

18
19

20
21

The District

that there wasn’t a sufficient showing of a sufficient likeli­
hood of persecution to justify granting the parole, the
discretionary relief and ordered and denied the application
.

22
23
24
25

again.
On review the District Court found that the District
Director's determination v;as not in the use of discretion and
agreed with the District Director that there had not been a
10

1

showing made of any sufficient likelihood of persecution*

2

Respondent did not appeal that

determination by the

3

District Court* instead he sought relief by private bill in

4

Congress*

K

year in 1966* he again petitioned for parole for withholding

6

of deportation* administratively* again claiming a hearing

7

under Section 242j that relief was denied by the District

8

Director on the ground that the prior proceeding was a fully

9

adequate hearing and that the determination had been made

10

When that bill was adversely acted upon the following

adversely to Respondent.
He sued again in the District Court to enjoin the

11

12

District Director from deporting him.

The Court found that the

13

prior proceedings were fully adequate* denied the relief.

14

appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit the Court

13

held that in view of the fact that Respondents ship had sailed

16

during the pendency of the administrative proceedings on his

17

claim of anticipated persecution that the revocation of the

18

conditional landing permit under Section 252(b) was no longer

19

proper basis for the deportation of Respondent.

On

The Court held that in effect unless the alien crewman

20

21

is in fact removed on his ship* the revocation, the expulsion

22

proceeding under Section 252

23

is entitled in all matters respecting his deportation* in all

24

matters of discretionary relief >to a hearing under Section

25

242(b).

must abort

11

and the alien crewman

1

We disagree with “the holding of the Court of Appeals.

2

We believe so long as the alien crewman8s conditional landing

3

permit is revoked during the time it is in effect, that is

4

during the time that the alien8s ship is still in port, that

3

it presents a fully adequate basis for removal of the crewman

6

from the United States, a determination of any administrative

?

or judicial proceedings that he might invoke on the question

8

of his deportability or on the question of discretionary relief.

9
10

Mr. Justice Brennan asked the question earlier, what
was the basis for his prior claim that he had a right to a
hearing under Section 242(b).

12

We really don81 know.

We ass time that by Respondent9 s

13

position in this court, in defending the judgment of the Court

14

of Appeals, is that he has a right to a hearing before a

IS
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24

25

special inquiry officer under 242(b) because that is the way
such claims are handled in regular 242(b) proceedings which the
Court of Appeals held he now has a right to.
1 have been unable to find any basis upon which it
could be inferred merely from Section 243(h) itself that there
is a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer.

It

would seem that the Court of Appeals took the only statutory
approach that can be made in this case, and that is to find the
right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer in the right
to a hearing before a special inquiry officer on all claims,
and all grounds of deportation in this case.
12

1

We begin our consideration of the statutory issue in

2

this case and Respondent also raises constitutional things but

3

the statutory issue with a hypothetical»
Suppose an alien crewman is issued a conditional

4

S

landing permit under Section 252(a) good for the time that his

6

ship is to remain in port»

7

goes several hundred miles inland where he obtains employment

3

in the training program of a manufacturing plant and enters intc

9

a long-term lease, year8s lease on an apartment.

He immediately leaves his ship and

During the time that his ship is still in port he is

10
11

found by an immigration officer and on the evidence of his

12

conduct lis landing permit is revoked, he is brought back to the

13
14

Port city and without objection placed on board his ship which
sails the next day for a foreign port»
As our research reveals that all courts which have

IS
18

17
13

considered the question of interpreting Section 252(a) and (b)
including the Court below in the instant case would agree that
the immigration officer in that case acted properly.
But the difficulty is, of course, that in the hypo­

19

20
21
22
23
24
25

thetical which is presented the alien’s voluntary departure
from this country, voluntary in the sense that uncontested
departure moots any challenge to the conduct of the immigration
officer.
We don’t believe that Congress enacted Section 252
merely to provide a basis or direction for conduct by an
13

-3

8

immigration officer in a situation that it couldn't be chal"

2

lenged in court»

oO

crewmen would exercise their rights for judicial review certainly

4

of the conduct of immigration officers under the statute»

5

We believe Congress envisioned that alien

Congress presumably recognised that in those cases

6

it is unlikely that the alien ship would wait for him until the ;

7

expiration, until the judicial proceedings were terminated»

8
9

Now Respondent adopts the reasoning of the Court of
Appeals and approaches the problem from the other side»

10

Respondent says, "Well, the Section 252(b) procedure do not

11

apply to the case where an alien crewman jumps his ship and

12

enters the United States without a permit or the case where he

13

gets a permit to ship out on another ship or a case in which his

14

permit is not revoked while his ship is still in port»"

IS
16

But he stays on longer than that and they say, "Well,
since the statute is thus narrowly designed it ought to be

17

construed more strictly to apply only in the case where the

!8

alien is in fact deported on his ship,"

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We disagree with that proposition»

We admit that

from the face of the statute, Congress apparently contemplated
the alien crewman's ship would be one of if not the primary
means for removing him from the United States»
But if Congress had wanted that to be the sole basis,
the sole means for removing him from the United States, if
Congress had wanted to limit the statute only to situations
14

where the alien is in fact removed on his ship it

could have

done so.
We believe that it begs the question in this case,
to say as the Court of Appeals did that the necessity — that
the justification for prompt removal, the justification for

i

quick resolution departs with the vessel.
That, it seems, that Congress contemplated only that
.

alien crewmen would be deported on their ships.

We don3t

believe that that was their contemplation at all.
'
-

They determined on the basis — Congress determined
on the basis of evidence, that there was a severe problem of
alien crewmen deserting their ships that there would be a
special class of alien crewmen who would be granted conditional
landing permits only on their agreement to depart with their
ship and if they failed of that agreement during the time that
their ships were still in port they were immediately deportable,
whether on their ships, whether on another ship of the same
line or whether after determination of any administrative or
judicial proceedings.
Wow the question has been raised, could Congress
rationally have made this determination when it exempted from
such procedures the crewman who jumped their ships or crewmen
who were admitted to ship out on another vessel.
Although the legislative history provides no guidance
on this question we believe that Congress rationally would have
15

11

made such a determination.

The alien crewman who jumps his

a

ship and enters without a permit at all or the alien, crewman

3

who overstays his conditional landing permit without it being

4

revoked may be found 10 days, 3 months, or 10 years later and

5

the 10 years later issue is the one I think that provides a

0

basis for distinction between the two cases.
Because unlike an alien who may have been in this

7
8

country for 10 years albeit illegally and had established

9

family relationships and other relationships which presents

10

some equities in this case, the alien crewman whose conditional

11

landing permit is revoked under Section 252 (b) has been here at

12

the most for less than 29 days.
At the most for the time that his ship has been in

13
14

port.

IS

Q

Suppose he stayed two months?

16

A

Suppose he stayed two months?

17
13
19

20

the argument that 1 am making does not require that we draw
the lines between two months and three months, three months
and four months, without in effect idle statutory limitations
period of Section 252(b).
Q

21
22,

23
24
25

Well, I think that

Two months he would get the same summary treat­

ment?
I

A

No.

No, sir, if he is here for 2 months or

10 years, he gets a proceeding under Section 242(b).
Q

Suppose he is here 1 hour after the ship leaves?
16

A

It is the same thing, Mr. Justice.

G

Same thing?

3

A

Because we can’t impose any other statutory

4

limitation.

S

Q

?

2

6

'

So his rights are determined by how long the

ship hangs around?

7

A

That is right.

8

G

You think that is what Congress meant?

9

A

Yes* sir* I do.

10

1!
12

13
14
15

16
17

l

I would like to turn in the very little time that I
have left to Respondent’s challenge that the statute is inter­
preted by the United States violates his right to due process
under the Fifth Amendment and also the Government5s obligations
under the protocol of relating to the status of refugees.
1 think that both claims can be comprised into a
single Federal due process claim.

The protocol incorporates by

reference certain provisions of international convention on
!■

18
19

20
21

22

same subject.

Respondent in Amicus cite certain provisions

of that convention which relate to expulsion of refugees on

-j

j
the assumption that respondent is a refugee.
But the accepted international construction of the
convention as the State Department advised the Senate when it
was considering protocol is that each of the contracting states :

23
.4

reserves the right to interpret the convention to make the
24

.

determination whether an individual is a refugee.
25

17

In this case after a hearing in which he was entitled
to present and which he did present evidence and was repre­
sented by counsel, the District Director found that Respondent
was not a refugee.
Now, on Respondent’s Federal due process claim, we
i
note first that Respondent does not here and has not as far as
we know at any time during these proceedings, challenged the
revocation of his conditional landing permit as being anything
other than a fully adequate constitutional basis for his removal
from the United States, nor does he contend that the revocation
of the conditional landing permit was arbitrary.
It hardly can be contended in light of his represen­
tation to the immigration officer that it was arbitrary in this
case.
Respondent’s request for asylum, therefore, was the
request of an alien in whose deportability had been properly
determined in a proceeding — in an unchallenged proceeding,
Furthermore, it was a request for discretionary relief,
A case somewhat analogous to the situation before the Court in
Jabers and Boyd in 351 U.S. in a case in which Respondent had
I
the burden of showing that in his case he would be subject to
persecution.

|

As I said before, he was given a hearing before a
Deputy District Director of the Immigration Service in which he
was represented by counsel, was permitted to testify himself
18

'i

and presented two other, witnesses and the District Director

2

found that there was not a sufficient showing of a likelihood

3

of persecution and that finding was upheld by the District

4

Court .
The only difference between the procedure which

5
Q

Respondent received in this case and the procedure which he

7

would have received under Section 242(b) under 243(h) claim,,

8

is that the determination was made by the District Director

3

rather than a special inquiry officer.

I

So the question is in a case of an admittedly deport- :

10
11

able alien seeking discretionary relief on the ground of

12

anticipated persecution whether it is consistent with due

13

process to have that discretion exercised by the District

14

Director rather than special inquiry officer.
We do not believe that in the circumstances of this

IS
13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Fedde.

MR. FEDDE;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court, my name is Bernhard Fedds of Portland, Oregon.
This story, this case is the story of a seaman who

is trying to comply with the law.

4

trying to evade the law.

3

in this case.

6

He is not a deserting seaman

I'
I think that makes a major difference ■

The question which I believe is before this Court is

7

whether an alien merchant seaman who enters this country on a

Q

0-X landing permit is entitled to an impartial hearing before

9

an independent and impartial and administrative judge on his

10

bona fide claim of right to stay here to escape persecution.

Now as I originally phrased this question 1 inserted
the words ’after his ship sails,’

i

I am not sure now.

After reading the brief of Mr. Ennis, Amicus of the
American Civil Liberties Union, whether I need to insert that
any longer.

In light of the treaty which protects refugees

and deserting seamen, although the deserting seaman chapter
applies only in that treaty or protocol applies only to seamen,
foreign seamen, flying in our case under the American flag,
I believe, therefore, that the question really boils
I
down to this, and our theory is that a seaman with a bona fide
claim of right is entitled to a plenary hearing with full right
of appeal under Section 242 in light of the new treaty and of
the Constitution and laws and cases.
That is our position.

Yes,

To outline the exact chronology of events, Stanisic
appeared on January 6, and asked for asylum.

He was taken to

On January 7, he was told that

he was asked by the immigration officials without benefit of
any counsel,, "Do you intend to return to your ship?"
This, of course, is the trick question.

He didn't

know what -- he just answered honestly, "No, I don't."
Then they said, "Your landing permit is revoked."
He had announced he was coming there for asylum, then subsequently his landing permit was revoked and then it was at
11 o'clock, remember this is on January 7, the day after he had
appealed for asylum, members of his family, Toskovich actually,
came to Mr. Robinson's office and said we need help.
Mr. Robinson was in another court at the time.
However, he filed a formal appearance about 12 o'clock that day,
one hour later.

That was what day?

January 7, still tha same day, but now 45

minutes later.

getting what amounted to a hustling process»
Under the circumstances all we could do was just ask
for a full hearing»

It was apparent to us that Mr» Abono and

Mr» Petilio* his assistant* were biased and prejudiced»

The

deposition* by the way* of Mr» Abono and Mr» Petilio appears in
the files of this case which are before this court and I think
the bias and prejudice are quite apparent.
26

It appeared again and again, even in the subsequent

i

z

hearings held January 25 and 26 at which time Mr, Abono and

3

Petilio, or Mr. Abono particularly took official, not judicial,

4

but official notice that conditions in Yugoslavia were fine

and that there was a relaxation of tensions toward political

refugees.

In that deposition it appears that there was no
basis in fact whatever for this finding.

In other words they

took judicial notice of nothing and yet came up with the
opposite of what Stanisic had been able to show at that hearing
on January 25 and 26.
It is in the course of these — well, if I may move
on to a statement of the case, the District Court referred the
case back to the District E^irector for a summary hearing on
physical persecution under Section 243(h).
The District Director found no physical persecution.
I underscore the word 'physical' here which are, of course, the
exact language of 243(h).
But he treated it as a matter of seeking or of a
request for parole under 253.1(e) and denied parole.
Well, Stanisic then asked the court to review because

21

of the bias and prejudice of the District Director.

The

22
District Court, Judge East, refused to change the order of the
23

District Director and then the matter died at that point.
24

Mr. Stanisic and his companion, Buchnich applied for a
25

27

1

private bill in Congress and it failed June 1966,

Then at

2

that point the District Director ordered Stanisic deported under’,

3

and also Buchnich deported and gave them 70 hour5s notice to

4

present themselves to the District Director for deportation

3

to Yugoslavia, and as I understand it, they were to be sent

S

there in handcuffs.

-<

!

In the meantime, however, Section 243(h) of the

7
3

statute had been changed.

In other words the goalposts had

9

been moved and no longer was it

physical persecution, now it

10

was persecution on account of race, religion or political

11

opinion.

We claim that, therefore, the goalposts had been

12

13
14

widened and we, therefore, had a greater right than we had under*
the question of physical persecution.
The District Director in the earlier proceedings used :

15
16

n
18

It had been broadened.

always the word physical persecution and we claimed that the
persecution that we were facing was persecution by reason of
religion, Orthodox, and political opinion, namely Chetnik
■

19

sympathies, anti-Yugoslav and government views.
And whether physical persecution would result is hard

20
21

22
23
24
25

to say although we have in our briefs pointed out some ten
different grounds upon which this man could face anything and
it is a very vague position he faces if he goes back, if ha is
sent back.

He could face anything up to the death sentence

back there and has been promised a life imprisonment.
23

j

We claim that, therefore, that he has now or had now
under the amended statute a broader claim than he had under the
earlier statute.
Q

When was the statute amended?

&

October 3* 1965, I believe.

Q

Some months after

A

—

After the first hearing and before this second

matter arose, yes.
Q

Really, are all these, the substantive issues

which his claim raises are really not before us at all, are they?
Or, isn't the only question whether or not the procedures of
252(b) were available and continued to be available even though
the ship had left the shores of the United States or whether
after the ship left the Government was required to bring a 242
proceeding and you were entitled to a 242 proceeding.

Isn't

that the only issue?
A

That is the issue in ray case.

Q

Isn't that the only issue, A, on which we
f

granted certiorari and the only issue really presented here?
A

Yes.

Q

Not the substance of your client's claim?

A

That is right.

That is right, your Honor.
On the second proceeding he petitioned for parole
under Section 243(h).

This was denied by again the same

District Director Abono.

I appear in the case at this point»

3

He then presented it through me.

How

I then approached the United States District Court
1

4

asking for a restraining order and cited a number of grounds,,

5

pointing out among other things that the ship had long since

0

left the shores and that he should be entitled to have a 242

7

hearing before a Special Inquiry Officer»

10

22

The District Court rejected on the grounds of
res adjudicata.

The Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit

reversed oh the ground that basically, and interpret the
\
statute, that when the ship departs the need for haste ends
and that he is therefore entitled to a full hearing on the
merits of the case.
Q

That is the real issue that we are deciding here?

A

That is the real issue in this case, yes.

That is correct, your Honor.
The point that I think is critical in this case which
strengthens my position is that protocol related

to status of

refugees v/hich was ratified November 1, 1968, about 90 days ago.
And this, I believe, applies to Stanisic and to all other
refugee seaman as well as refugees in general.
No longer can they be sent back on the ship that
brought them.

In fact, they cannot be sent back to the country 1

23
24
25

from which they are seeking refuge, or from which they are
seeking asylum.
30

In fact, no political refugee under this protocol as
I understand it can be sent back at all to the country of
origin or the country that is threatening to persecute him.
s
And, therefore, under the circumstances of this case it appears
to me that Stanisic in no event would be sent back to Yugoslavia
in no event, of course, back on the ship that brought him,
Q

Was that ratified by the Senate?

A

Yes, yes, it has, Mr. Chief Justice.

So, this is our position.
That the summary expulsion proceedings should be
limited to the absconding seaman who has no claim of right.
Where there is, however, a claim of right as in this case, he
is entitled to a full and fair hearing on the facts with full
right of appeal.
This is the minimum of due process in my opinion
under the Treaty and the Constitution and the cases.
If Stanisic is denied this he faces a severe punish­
ment, probably life imprisonment.
Q

All we ask is fairness.

Well, do I understand that you no longer con-

tend that the statute entitles you to this?
A

Oh, yes, I do believe the statute also entitles

us to this but I simply say that protocol has reinforced our
position that it says refugees shall foe given due process.
Q

Then the question is to who is a refugee,

whether he is a refugee and whether a -- and what procedures
31

1

1

have, to be followed to establish that he belongs in that

2

category#- don’t you?

A

3

There is, of course, the first factual question,

that is the claim of righto

4

That is true, your Honor»

5

Q

How does that depend on the statute?

G

As I understand it the United States has reserved to

'

7

8

9
10

U
12
13
14
15

1G

itself the right to determine who is a refugee, then presumably
in the statute the United States has prescribed a procedure
by which in cases of this sort it will make a judgment as to
who is a refugee.
How you are claiming one sort of procedure and your
client was given another kind of procedure.,

I will be interests'

in what you have to say about the statute and what light the
statute sheds upon whether you are correct in your contention
or the Government is correct in its contention as to the
prescribed procedure, prescribed formal proceeding.
I was interested in your argument, and thus far you

17
13
19

seem to have dropped out reference to statute and perhaps that
was just the order of argument.
A

Well, perhaps I have been unduly impressed by

20
21

the protocol.

That may be part of the point.

And the protocol

came quite a bit later in terms of statutory enactment and so on

22
in the chronology of events.
23

Q

Are you arguing on the basis of protocol that

24

whatever the statute may have originally required or permitted,
25

32

1

this case has to be determined now within the four corners of

2

the protocol?

3

A

I would say that protocol reinforces our position»

4

Q

I don8t follow this.

You told us that the

3

protocol no longer permits deportation to the country of

6

origin* in the case of- the political refugee or whatever he may

7

be.

3
9
10

13
14

17

Then I don't understand.

If that is so* what

It may be that the statute will have to be de­

clared or at least modified or declared unconstitutional to
the extent that it conflicts with the protocol.

This may be

the position.
But even if we stay under 242 and the statute and I
am perfectly willing to stay under that as well* the point there
that he is entitled to a full 242 hearing because he --Q

Well* suppose he gets it.

Suppose it is con­

cluded that, he is deported* then what happens to him?
What controls then* protocol?

20
A

21

Yes* I believe the protocol would control.

So

he could not be deported to Yugoslavia.

sent back if the ship is still there?

Regulation 253?

Q

Yes.

A

Yes.

Q

If he comes in the last day or the next to the

last day and says, "I am not going back and I refuse to tell you
why, but 1 am not going back."

And then the ship goes out»

Do you say that that entitles him to stay here and
have a hearing as you claim he is entitled to have?
A

Well, where he has a claim of right, yes»
36

1

Although as the Court has worded it he wouldn't have stated any

2

claim of right as 1 understand the question.
Q

3

Is that right?

Well, they say we will give you a hearing.

4

he says, "I won't take a hearing now.

5

I won't tell you anything."

1 won't put on my case;

Is that what he did in this instance?

6

And

You put it on

7

the basis that he only had 15 minutes but I suppose he had been

8

thinking about this before and knew why he didn't want to go

3

back.

10

Couldn't he at least have stated to the officer at that

time v;hy he didn't want to go back?

I would like to say — I see that the light is li^ and

I just want to take a minute to explain the 253 matter.
Q

You have five minutes.

I am going to give you five minutes more because I
want to give the Government five minutes more and ask them some
37

questions, too»
A

The 253 is a regulation.

It is set forth at the

end of the Government3s brief, page 46 of the Government *s
brief.

The history of this is set forth rather neatly ir>. the

brief of the Amicus.
And particularly, well beginning with page 5 and
following on the brief of Mr. Ennis.
The gist of the argument is that 253 is a regulatory
or Immigration Service floss and is not required by the statute
and under 243(h) as Government counsel have indicated, there is
no procedure set forth.

We claim that 242 proceedings apply,

namely, a Special Inquiry Officer hearing.
And for that reason the regulatory, that is the regu­
lations 253 hearing should be stricken.
at all.

They axe not necessary

And it is this which is doing the damage in the case.
One point also I want to bring up and that is the

point that we are talking about a de minimus matter here.

As

far as oVer the last ten years there have been only 276
Yugoslav seamen involved.
I pick up Yugoslav seamen because they are the primary
ones from refugee countries, that is countries where they might
have persecution.

There may be seamen from England and other

but they are not seeking political asylum.
There are 276 over a 10-year period; 27.6 men per
year on an average.

That is the only additional burden that
38

1

1

would be inflicted upon the staff of the Special Inquiry

2

Officer if the court throws out 253 as a regulatory provision

3

and then permits these refugee seamen to have a full hearing.

4

Q

Even if the ship is still in port?

S

A

Even if the ship is still in port* but in my

6
7

case we don't have that question.
Q

I think you do.

Yota filed a case in the District

8

Court for a restraining order while the ship was still in port,

9

didn51 you?

10

A

Yes* sir.

11

Q

That is what you meant that at any time he is

12

entitled to a 242 hearing?

13

A

Yes.

14

At any time?

Yes, although there is a question further added*

22

.25

may it please the Court* that after the ship has gone the
hearings should shift from a 253 hearing to a 242 hearing and
before a Special Inquiry Officer.

Because now the need for

haste is gone.
Q

But in your application for a restraining order

didn't you ask for a 242 hearing?
A

Yes. we did.

Q

While the ship was still in port?

A

Yes, we did.

Q

You change that position now?

MR. CONNOLLY?

a

11

is very kind in extending the Government's time which probably
was terminated in the opening statement, because there are some
matters of some importance, of great importance, in this case
in which the Government and Respondent strongly disagree.
In the first place Respondent's counsel has painted

Mr. Chief Justice, the Chief Justice

the picture of an individual who in good conscience after coming
ashore rather than trying to fade into the population presents
himself in an Immigration Office to claim asylum under the
statute.
I would like to call, to invite the court's attention
to Respondent's testimony before the Deputy District Director
on remand from the District Court to pages 12, 14, 20. to 22,
29 and 30 of his testimony which is in the record in the court
filed in a little Manila folder.
Q

I have it here.

A

It is not printed.

It is the Government's position that that testimony
gives persuasive evidence that Respondent entertained the idea

25

40

1

and the intention well before he came into Oregon at that time

a

to desert bis ship and to remain permanently in the United

3

States *

At the time he came into Oregon he obtained a con­
ditional landing permit from an immigration officer on his
agreement, to return with his ship and his representation to the
immigration officer that he was going to return with his ship
and that he was not going to desert the ship»
I think the best thing you can say on the basis of
this evidence is that the position of the Respondent finds
himself now is the scheme that was initially conceived in mis­
representation „
If he had been honest with the immigration officer
and told him that he was claiming political asylum because of
anticipated persecution he clearly would not have been, entitled
to a temporary landing permit under 252.

He would have been

given a hearing under regulation as to whether he may be
paroled in the United States but in such a case that determi­
nation would be made by the District Director as it was

ID
20
21

actually in the present case and he would have had no claim
to a hearing before a Special Inquiry Officer.
So, on the basis of initial misrepresentation he has

22
pyramided his status into a situation where it has completely
23
made a shambles of the whole statutory scheme.
24
And the next point I would like to bring out —
25
41

Q

1

Another way of looking at it is that a parson off

a ship £rom Yugoslavia coining to a strange country worked om»

3

pretty well to get even to the place where he might get justice»

Think of an American landing in Yugoslavia and trying to work

argument at all»

I don'c get this

all the intricacies of all these sections?
A

10
?!

12

13

'

Well, 1 think after Mr. Stanisic got on shore

he did miraculously well against what Congress directed in 'cn&
statute.

The only point that I am trying -- the essential

point that X am trying to make is that he was asked one question

14

by the immigration officer when the immigration officer came

15

aboard the ship and that is, "Do you intend to depart with your

10
17

13
19

20

2!
22

23
24
25

ship"and he said, "Yes," and that is how he got a conditional
landing permit.
And the evidence in the record we believe discloses
that he didnot intend to deport with the ship.
Q

What is the net of what he said, what you said?

A

The net of what he said is that he delayed,

he said he delayed getting married and jumping ship until ne
could get to the United States because he saw that --- he had
been to the United States six times —- and he delayed jumping
ship until he got to Oregon because he had a cousin in Oregon

Would he then have been entitled to a hearing on the
ground that his ship had gone?

A

He would have been entitled to a hearing under

10

Section 242 and because of the pronoun in Section 252 there

ii

would have been no exemption from that hearing requirement.

would have gotten a 242 hearing.

The record, we believe, as supplemented by the

Government shows that at the time that he presented himself to
the immigration officer —

stood him to say that the lawyer, after the ship had gone,
presented it to him and told him the facts.

That is not in the record?

The ship was here when he presented himself to

the immigration officer»

5

Q

Suppose that had been done?

A

Under the statute,, Mr» Justice# unless the

landing permit is revoked while the ship is in port# unless you

a

get ahold of the alien and revoke his permit while the ship is

9

io

in port he must be proceeded against under the full procedures#
so we wouldn81 have had this case if the ship had been ——

ii

Q

That would have been in a different attitude?

12

A

Yes# sir»

Q

Then it all depends on whether the lawyer

13

15

IG
17
18

20
21

22
23

that

point depends on whether the lawyer did that# doesn't it?
A

Well —-

Q

I understood hira to say the lawyer did.

I am wrong,

Maybe

Did you understand that?

A

No# I didn't,

I didn't hear it.

Q

You didn't?

A

Now the next and I think more important point I

would like to make is that the Respondent relies quite heavily
on the statement of brief of the Amicus of The American Civil
Liberties Union to the effect that the hearing which the
service offers to alien seamen under 253,1 tf) of the regulation,

24

is a rather pro forma hearing which results in a fast shuffle
25

44

back fco the ship.
They cite three cases for that.

The first case they

cite is the instant Ccs.se in which when an opportunity was given
to Respondent to present evidencet he completely refused to
give any evidence at all.
The second case
Q

You don't think that is a totally unfair charac­

terization if it is true that he was given 15 minutes9 notice?
A

Well? Mr. Justice

Q

I can readily understand that a lawyer faced with

that might quickly find his way over to the United States
District Court and file a bill and? because lawyers after all
under our system are supposed to have some time to get a pre­
pared case for their client and you can't expect a Yugoslav
seaman or any layman to go over in 15 minutes and present the
facts in support of his claim of religious or political
persecution?
A

That is right? Mr. Justice? and the remedy that

is available to a lawyer in that type of case as in any adminis­
trative procedure and any judicial procedure is to ask for a
continuance.

And that is what the lawyer here didn’t do.

The lawyer said that he had a right to a hearing
before a Special Inquiry Officer? under Section 242? and on the
face of the record it wouldn’t have made any difference if he
had 15 minutes or 15 hours or 15 days to prepare for it.
45

What he claimed was a different type of a hearing.
Xt didn't mates any difference how much time he had gotten.
The other two cases and X won't go into them now
because the time is running out were also cases.

The Kordic

cases in the Second Circuit and the Glavic case in the Fifth
Circuity cases in which the hearing was impeded by a claim that
there was a right to a herring under Section 242,
But more than that* 1 was worried by this point,, and
X checked with the Immigration Service and the Immigration
Service advised me that asking to represent to the court that
in the hearings under the regulation of an alien seaman who
claims persecution if he is returned he gets the exact same type
of hearing as he would have gotten under the full scale 242
proceeding.
He is entitled to have counsel, he is entitled to
have the assistance of counsel, he is entitled to present any
evidence which is readily available to him.
Q

Are you saying that it makes no difference

whether there is a hearing before a District Director or before
a hearing officer?
A

No, sir.

Q

I don't, assume you are saying that, Mr. Connolly.

A

The constitutional issue comprises that dif­

ference but .it comprises only that difference and it is not a
difference in either the availability of counsel, the
46

1

availability of time or the availability of witnesses.

2

all those situations the proceeding is exactly the same.
Q

3
4

In

Do you also suggest that you tell us that they

give them more than 15 minutes to get ready?

A

S

Mr. Justice, I would assume that any proceeding

6

in which you have a right to counsel you have a right to

7

present evidence that is readily available, you also have a

8

right to a continuance if you ask for it and no continuance

9

was asked for.
Q

10

Well»- there is a very important point, a par­

11

ticularly important point in my mind as to whether this

12

Respondent or his counsel should have presented some statement

13

as to the basis for his claim of right to stay in this country.

14
15
15
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

Well, certainly.

Q

But, that meets to what, to my mind, is a very

powerful obstacle when you get this pre-emptory arid unexplained
statement that he is to come over and have a hearing in 15
minutes.
Was there any reason for that?

Is there any reason

for saying 18 minutes?
A

Mr. Justice, the record doesn't disclose that.

Q

No, it doesn't and it was the same afternoon

that the lawyer went over to the United States District Court
and filed his papers.
A

Is that right?

That is right.
47

i

Q

The same day„ the same day those two things
It doesn't take much imagination to understand what

happened»

happened here, Mr, Connolly,
A

Well, Mr. Justice, I think an alternative ex­

planation on a cold record that doesn't disclose anything is
that it was perhaps in the nature of preliminary examination
to find out exactly what nature of claim Mr. Stanisic was
raising.
Q

I spoke sharply to you.

I did not mean to speak

sharply to you.
A

I understand, sir.

Q

But to any lawyer, this really is kind of a

startling situation.
A

But before we presume ~ I think it is unfair

to presume in a cold record that the Immigration Service was
willing to give him only what he could have gotten in 15 minutes
and if I may also add to my answer, the Justice used the term,
9a claim of right,* perhaps adopting it from what Mr. Fedde
had argued.
The Government fails to see how under either the
Constitution or the International Protocol what is under
American law a discretionary relief entrusted to the Attorney
General somehow becomes a claim of right in this case.
Q

You mean the statute, the congressional direction

here is not with respect to danger as it was then, danger of
48

physical persecution as it is now, a claim based upon religious
or political persecution, you mean those are meaningless so far
as Immigration and Naturalization Service is concerned?
A

No, sir»

Far from it»

Q

1 thought the Service was subject to congressional

direction and required to follow the congressional direction,
isn't it?
A

All I am saying is -~

Q

And required to follow the congressional

direction, isn't it?
A

Yes, sir»

Q

And isn't that a claim of right?

Doesn't a

person have a right that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service like all other agencies of the Government follow the
law as enacted by the Congress?
A

Certainly, Mr» Justice, it does, but the question

is, does he have a right to the relief?

He has a full right

to claim the relief, he has a full right to present evidence in
support of his claim.
Q

But the relief is discretionary.

His right is to have clear communication with

both the discretion of the Attorney General, is that it?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Mr. Connolly, what affect did the protocol have

on this statute, if any?
A

Mr. Chief Justice, I implicitly assume for the
49

I

purpose of this argument that the protocol imposes on the
1

2

Government e. right, an obligation to allow an alien seamen in

3

this country a fair opportunity to claim that he is a refugee

4

and a fair determination of his refugee status.

5

We have also assumed that that was the alien seaman8s

6

right under the statute so insofar as the Government's approach

7

to handling persecution claims the treaty, the International

B

Protocol has not affected the Government's attitude at all»

9

We have always assumed that 243{h) is available to

'10

aliens, the discretionary relief is available to alien seamen

1!

under the statute and we promulgated a regulation which gives

12

the alien crewman a right to claim such relief,

13

So, it hasn't had any effect at all.

14

assuming at the best that the protocol has the effect of

15

opposing that obligation of the Government, it has no change

16

in our procedure,

17

Q

That is the --

Well, as I understood Mr, Fedde, he thought the

18

protocol prevented the Government now from sending the men back

19

under this 252(b) before his ship left,

20

21
22
23

24
25

A

Mr, Justice, nc£ Mr, Chief Justice, I think the

only way you could get to that is if you assume that the man
is a refugee and under the Government's, the United States
agreement to the protocol reserved to the Government the right
to determine whether the man is a refugee or not.
Q

I see.
50

A

So if the Government determines that he is not

a refugee then by that fact, by that fact the substantive pro­
visions of the Convention don't apply to him.

If the Government

determines that he is a refugee then he is entitled to dis­
cretionary relief and the Government will give him the dis­
cretionary relief,
Q

I see,

Mr, Fedde, Mr. Justice Black would like to ask you a
question.
Q

What I wanted to ask you about

was this,

I understood you to say that after the boat left you
or some other lawyer for the Respondent 'went to the Immigration
Department and told them that you did have this bona fide claim
and asked for a hearing.
Was I wrong?
FURTHER ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. BERNHARD FEDDE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR, FEDDEs

Yes and no.

We asked initially for a

hearing,
Q

I am talking about after the boat left.

A

The request was made for hearing both before

and after the boat had left.
for a 242 hearing.

The request was made on January 7

The District Court referred the case on this-

petition for injunctive relief, referred the case back to the
same District Director for a hearing under 253 on physical
51

persecution and it was 253 hearing, not a 242 hearing held
about 10 days after the ship had left*

And this was ordered

some 10 days after the ship had left»
So the timing is, or the hearing itself was held
after the ship had left.
Q

But the request was made while the ship was still

in port?in the United States?
A

Is that right?

Yes o

I might add.

May I?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN?

You may have just a moment

if you wish.
MR. FEDDEs

Just one point in the protocol that has

been referred to by — just points out with reference to who is
a refugee, I refer the court to page 30 of the brief of
Respondent in the terms of protocol.
G

Mr. Fedde, in' this case, the Court appointed you

to represent this indigent and we appreciate the fact that you
have done so with diligence and fairness, and Mr. Connolly, we
appreciate the fairness and vigor with which you represent the
interest of the United States.
A

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A

Thank you, your Honors.

(Whereupon, at 11s35 a.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
