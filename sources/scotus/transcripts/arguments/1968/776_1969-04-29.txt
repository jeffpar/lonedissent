ORAL ARGUMENT OF VERNON B. ROMNEY, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. ROMNEY:

please the Court.
The Utah Public Service Commission was an intervener

n
12
13
14
15
16

Mr. Chief Justice, Justices, if it

in this case and filed a notice of appeal on September 18 of
1963.
At that time Mr. Phil L. Hanson was the Attorney
Genex*al of the State of Utah.

I

The appeal was actually handled

by Daniel L. Berman a Special Assistant to the Attorney Genax'al
of the State of Utah.

1?

21

i
Upon taking office on January 6 of 1969, as the
Attorney General of Utah, I began a careful investigation of
the merits of prosecuting the appeal or of dismissing it.
This I did in association with the Governor of the State of
Utah, Cal Rampton.

22
We eventually determined that it was in the best
23
24

interest of the State of Utah to move to dismiss the appeal
and thereupon took steps in February to perfect the dismissal

25

3

I

and as stated in our short brief, our reasons were, among

z

others, that we felt no responsibility for the litigation of

o

the Clayton Act, and felt this was the responsibility if, of

4

anyone, that is to appeal of the Justice Department and not of

S

us.

Nil

We felt for one thing that would be a tremendous
amount of expense to our small State, that we did not have on
■
our legal staff experienced experts in the field that it would
be necessary for us to employ them and to reproduce the record
i
and perform many activities and employ many people which would
take a considerable amount of our money and that it was a very
:
difficult thing to do.
■

We thought it would take a lot of time and would
prevent the termination of this case which has dragged on I
understand for a period of about eleven years.
We determined that the issues which were involved in

j

our jurisdictional statement were those which affected in the
;

18
19
20
21

22

main other States a good deal more than they did Utah, and it

|
appeared that the other States wers not interested in appealing
i

usd took no efforts to perfect their appeals.
We felt no obligation to carry out our- appeal in

1
s

the interests of these other States and other people at our own
expense, and in a word we were left to go it alone.

23

i
We also felt that there was no evidence that another

24
company than Colorado Interstate Gas Company would do a better
25
4

jeob.

We felt the Colorado Interstate Gas Company had great

experience, solid background and financial stability to do the
orkwwell, and we felt that they were eventually we came to feel
that we were getting to know them and they would be a good
neighbor with us in Utah, would be very helpful to us„

!

And after we carne to the point of determining that
our principal real interests which were of an economic nature
in this case v/ould be provided for, that is that they would
keep their headquarters in Salt Lake City, that they would keep
the employees who worked there, all of them on the job, at the
same or increased rates of compensation, that indeed they would
employ other people than those presently on the payroll in
the El Paso Headquarters —• when all of these things were
determined we felt that we would benefit materially from
having Colorado Interstate Gas Company upheld as the company
to take over the Northwest Pipeline System»
Seme allegations have been made that this was an
'

unusual thing, that the Governor of the State of Utah signed
i

the motion before the court to dismiss the appeal but this was
i

done only in the interest of time and the fact that the
Governor sit that time was a member of the Bar of the Supreme
Court of the United States and that Mr. Berman determined that
he should do it in this manner, there at no time has been
II any difference of opinion since I first learned of the
Governor's attitude toward the case.

He felt it should be dismissed,

1 did, and the

Public Service Commission of the State of Utah joined me in
this belief.
Thank you* sir.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr, Payne,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEON PAYNE, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR, PAYNE:

Mr, Chief Justice and members of the

Court,
I am counsel for the El Paso Natural Gas Company,,
and have been serving as such since this court5 s decision in
Cascade,
As I understand the questions which are before the
court for discussion this morning, they relate to two questions.
One, should the motion of Utah to dismiss the case
be granted or denied, and secondly, should Mr, Bennett’s
motion for another hearing in the case be granted or denied.
.

I would argue to '.you that the motion of Utah should

j
1

be granted,

I think that the rules are clear that an appellant

who does not wish to follow an appeal has the right to be
i

relieved.
I would be the last to argue to this Court, howe-yer,
that the granting of the motion to dismiss filed by Utah is
a bar to this Court’s ability or power to police its own
mandates,

I am not arguing that.
6

I think this Court can police its mandates.

1

I think

2l

the question presented, therefore, by the second of the two

3

motions I described is not whether the court can police its

4

mandates but whether it should in this case reopen

The question then really should turn on whether

I submit to your Honors that this is not a case in
1
which that remedy should be employed.

I would like to just

point out that the Court has in other cases reached down and
policed its mandate.

In those casas, however, and I believe

I am correct in all cases where the court has written to the
subject, the matter has been properly before it on appeal.
i
I would suggest to you that this matter is before you \

Just as an

example I would like to give you three instances of why I don't ;
23
think this court should reach down and reopen the decision
24
below.

j

I
j

Running throughout the pleadings filed by Messrs.

\

2

Bennett, Flynn and Stewart, are lurid allegations that El Paso

3

in some way has profited by the failure to divest these

4

properties, which your Honors ordered us to do in U. S. v.

5

El Paso.

6

And that this means that corporate crime pays, and

7

that in some way El Paso is pocketing $22,000 a day of ill

a

gotten gains.

s

I would like to set this record straight on that.

As all of us know who were in the court below, the

to

lower court, Judge Chilson, made inquiry whether under the

n

divestiture proposed, El Paso stood to gain or lose by its

l 12

13

I 14
15

I IS
: 17

I 13
; 19
I 20

divestiture of the Northwest properties.
We produced an exhibit, Exhibit 65, which was
distributed to all counsel and it was placed in the record and
supported by sworn testimony.
That exhibit shows that El Paso8s total investment in
these properties from 1957 on is a matter of some $579 million.
When that investment is reduced by the full amount of the
investment in West Coast stock and Northwest Production stock
which El Paso acquired in the acquisition, but which it is not

f
\

divesting to the new company here -- when that investment is
21
122

further reduced by every dollar that El Paso has recouped from
j
its operation of these properties, depreciation, depletion,

23
124
125

amortisation and importantly, every dollar of income which
j
has been derived from the operation of these properties, that
8

I

is the $22,000 a day — when all of that is subtracted, when
the debt that is to be transferred to the new company is
subtracted, that El Paso has a net unrecouped investment in
these properties of $146 million.

I
i

Now stated another way, that means that when we have
divested these properties which we have owned and operated for
twelve years, we are paid $100 million in the form of stock of
the new company, we will have lost ever these years of operation

}

of $46 million.
Now someone will be quick to point out that we are
retaining the West Coast stock and the Northwest Production
stocky both of those are ordered to be divested by the court.
Our investment in those two assets is $75 million.
* On the market today they will bring approximately $35 million,
So that we have an additional $40 million of loss which we face
when we divest these, two assets that we are retaining.
Therefore, I say to you that this is not a case in
i
i

which the Supreme Court should be concerned over the questions

i

raised in the pleadings of Messrs. Bennett, Flynn and Stewart,
as to whether or not in the Clayton Act divestiture the Court
should inquire v;hether the divesting company has realized a
profit or a loss.
This is a question of where the facts are undisputed,
that El Paso has realised an enormous loss in the operation and
divestiture of these properties.
9

\

Two other points.
resisted a cash sale.

We are told that EX Paso has

As Mr. Bennett puts it, a clean cash sale

without residual complications.

Mr, Bennett is correct.

We

have resisted that form of divestiture since the beginning and
the reason is very simple.
We are engaged in a divestiture plan, not El Paso’s
plan, but the court’s plan, in which we will receive §100
million of preferred stock.

That exchange of assets for

preferred stock will be tax free and we have a ruling from
the IRS to that effect.
Were we to follow Mr. Bennett’s suggestion and sell
the same properties for $100 million of cash, it would generate
a tax, unnecessary, in the range of $50 million.

That is a

residual complication which we consider we are entitled to
take into account.
Now, in the minute or so I have left, X would like

j

to comment on the allegations that we have been dilitory in
seeking this.

El Paso has never fought for delay.

ha3 never taken an appeal to this court.

El Paso

El Paso has never

failed to meet a deadline imposed by the court below.

to augment the court’s decree.

That proceeding has been heard, j

the record is closed, and the briefs are in, and there has been 1

no opposition from any party.

Messrs. Flynn and Stewart and

Bennett were not a party to that proceeding.

The Commission

stands ready to issue its order authorising the divestiture of
'these properties.
El Paso at this moment is ready, able, willing and
I may say without any rancor over the last twelve years, we are
anxious to divest these properties.

We can complete the

divestiture in 90 days.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. HOOPER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
(Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and Seven Others)
MR. HOOPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.

I appear here on behalf of the eight interveners
named in the joint motion to affirm the judgment of the District
Court or dismiss the appeal of the State of Utah, the brief
in support of this motion.
This raotion was served upon all parties of record in
the lower court proceedings last February, and filed on April 21
after entry of this court's order seating this hearing.
These intervenors are the three State Commissions of
Idaho, Oregon and Washington, and in addition the principal
gas distributors serving those States.
11

I

All gas so distributed and regulated is obtained from
El Paso Natural Gas Company.,

Upon completion of this divesti­

ture it will then be obtained solely from the successful
acquirer of El Paso's Pacific Northwest Divisione
Differing responsibilities and interests of these
several parties have occasioned the full individual partici­
pation by all three Commissions and. most of these distributors
in the District Court proceedings held during 57 days of trial
'
;

| over many months.
These parties conducted cross-examination of witnesses
for all nine applicants, and presentation of the affirmative
evidence.

For the purpose of simplifying the pleadings and

record on this appeal, these efforts have been united now by
their strong common interest in promptly finalizing a judgment
which will end the long period of adversity to which they have
been innocently subjected as a result of this litigation.
We urge the granting of Utah’s motion to dismiss its
appeal.

In so doing, I speak not only for the four Commissions
'

and distribution company counsel who are present today, but
also for those who were unable to be present in stating to you
that these interveners agree, first, that the District Court's
decision fully complies with your mandate in Cascade, et aL,
'versus El Paso.

I

And, second, that the District Court selected the
most highly qualified applicant to achieve the objectives of
12

5

a

such mandate in the shortest possible time.
Like Mr, Payne, we do not question this Court's

3

authority to re-examine its mandate and compliance with it.

4

We do urge, however, that your review be confined to the

5

question whether the mandate has teen carried out upon the

S

record before this court.

\

7

The allegations of so-called facts contained in the

8

all too recent pleadings of the self-styled protector of the

9

public, an amicus curiae, who have not seen fit to comply with

the rules of practice, must not be permitted a status equal
to the findings of a judge who was carefully hand-picked, if
you will*, to hear this case.
The findings based on a record of some 15,000 pages,
I
which was compiled by responsible counsel and their witnesses
representing 33 parties, and applicants.
We are highly concerned over the prospect that such

[

£ indings could be upset by these presumptuous and tardy
\
challenges, founded only upon contentions contained in Utah's
jurisdictional statement and as these persons have stated
themselves, a glance at a map of the west.
Far from being spokesman for the public, which
Mr. Bennett emphatically is not, as to any Pacific Northwest gas|
consumers, Mr. Bennett seeks to prolong indefinitely a cause
I
whose continuance can only reap further injury on those directly;
dependent on El Paso's Pacific Northwest Division.
(
.13

fl

We can only conjecture as to his reasons for this,
but it is noteworthy that he did not present evidence on the
record below to support his belated contentions»

Where was he,

we may ask, while the several interveners and others were busy
in court examining into possible conflicts of interest, possible
anti-trust implications, the extent of independence from
El Paso of the proposed acquirer, and other pertinent factors
bearing on the relative qualifications of the applicants.
Likewise, we can only conjecture as to his contentions
concerning our position in support of the judgment below.

We

do state, however, that any implications that these intervenors
were bought off are wholly without foundation in fact.
If we had any doubt about the propriety of the lower
court’s decision we would not in view of our complete dependence
upon an urgent need for adequate and increasing gas supplies,
which only a fully qualified applicant can furnish us, be here

Mr. Chief Justice,, if it p3-ease the

Court, I think I would be remiss in not noting on behalf of
the Bar our regret that this — we are told this is the last
session of this court over which you, Mr. Chief Justice, will
preside.

We shall miss you.
In terms of California Interstate Gas, I have in

my main argument several points only to make.

The first is,

we are not, we have not been a potential competitor.
In 1965 when the Cascade case was before you, in
the record in that proceeding, your Honors had proposed findings
which had been submitted by the Government to the Trial Court,
Judge Ritter.
I would like to summarize briefly two findinas which

j

the Government had proposed at that time, over 14 years ago,
.

but which Judge Ritter never passed upon.
21

22
23
24
25

The first was proposed Government Finding 60, which
'

said for several months Colorado Interstate has attempted to
discuss with El Paso a purchase of the properties to be divested]
I
but has been rebuffed in its attempts.
I
f

IS

1

The second proposed finding, Proposed Finding 61,

2

?as that Colorado Interstate would be interested in using the

3

facilities to be divested as the basis for a. project to

4

inter and serve the California marcet.,

5

It is improbable that Colorado XNterstate would by

6

.tself and without those facilities be in a position to enter

7

:he California market.

a

Now your Honors, what was true in 1965, as the

9

Sovernment stated it in its proposed findings, was true in the

10

.ong hearing subsequent to your remand, and in the proceedings

11

>efore Judge Chilson.

12

Despite the fact that there were some six months of

13

teargins, that there were 26 parties, that two sanior executives

14

>f Colorado Interstate testified, and were cross-examined at

13

.ength by everyone, including the Government, there is nothing

IS

,n the record before this court to cast the slightest doubt

17

n the validity of the proposed finding which the Government

18

.tself tendered to Judge Ritter in 1965.

19

The fact of the matter is that Colorado was not and

20

,s not interested nor capable of competing in the California

21

arkefc without the facilities which it proposes here to acquire.

22

I donst think that your Honors will find a word of

23

vidence in the record suggesting the contrary.

2.4

sartainly the findings of Judge Chilson.

I 25

indings, as you suggested should be made.

17

Those are

They are meticulous
And

Jie has made their.

i

There is nothing that X am aware of in the record to cast the

2

slightest factual doubt about it.

3

The mounting competition .to California? as your

4

Honor's opinions have pointed out? in this industry? is a very

5

expensive and difficult project? because obviously what we are

6

competing for is the incremental demand.
Pursuant to the decision below we are already at work

7

We are already at work competing tc the extent that

9

v?e can for the California market.

We have, pursuant to the

10

contract with California, a copy of which we submitted to your

11

Honors, engaged in negotiations wi:h purchasers in California.

12

We are making market studies.

We are conducting

13

feasibility studies.

14

are trying to get ourselves into a position where we will have

15

assurance of sufficient business in California that would

18

warrant us in acquiring the very great reserves of gas wthat

17

will be required and in spending some $250 million to build

10

a pipeline to get that gas to California.

19

We are making engineering studies.

How

your Honors have in mind, of course, that, the

20

California market is a very different thing today from what it

21

was ten years ago.

to go into competition in California, faces entrenched strong

23

competition from three companies, the smallest of which is

24

twice our sire.

If this

court sees fit to grant the motion of Utah to dismiss its

appeal^ we shall progress this summer with our work and hope-

fully be in a position to reach seme final conclusion that we

4

are able to go ahead, because we have the business, and we

5

are working on the acquisition of the reserves, and we are

6

fortunately in a position to contemplate a substantial financing

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TVER E. SKJEIE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA

MR. SKJEIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

3

The people of the State of California wish to make
two points today.
First, what is California5s position to the two

4

motions which are pending, and second, what is the basis on

5

which we arrived at that position?

6

First, as to California's position on the motions,

7

it supports the District Court's divestiture decree.

8

means that California urges that Utah's motion to dismiss

9

11
12

16
17

19
20

That

should be granted forthwith, and secondly that Mr. Bennett's
motion for a hearing should likewise be acted upon forthwith
and denied.
While our use of the word forthwith twice involves
a redundancy, this is intentional.

For it emphasizes what we

believe is a vital facet of this proceeding.

As I will amplify

shortly, we believe and we are convinced that achievement of
this court's objective, restoration of competition for the
sale of natural gas in California is a now perhcips or a
probablg never matter.
If divestiture is not completed in the very immediate
future: t then it appears to us that the chances of achieving
the court’s objective and California's objective will be so

21

.

i

materially depreciated that such objective will not be possible \
22
of achievement by anyone, Colorado Interstate Gas or any of
23
the other applicants in the foreseeable future.
24
Turning to the basis of California's position, at
25
20

?

the District Court’s initial hearing following the Cascade

2

decisions, the pretrail conference of June 9,, 1967, it was

3

indicated that the would be purchasers were or had been in the
I

4

oil* gas and pipeline business and could contribute their

5

knowledge and experience and that such would be a real value

8

in the divestiture proceeding.

7

This, California found to be very true.

a

Amongst other things, the trial proceedings and the

22
£3
24

evidence elicited by these purchasers and from them through
cross-examination of them, shotted several things.
First, it showed that the chances of restoring the

divestee to be named to a position where it could and hopefully
to our point of view at least would compete in the California
market were decreasing as each day passed.
For example, it showed that uncommitted gas supplies
were becoming more scarce all of the time.

Those recently

developed were proven as for example in the Permian Basis,
the evidence showed, were being bought, up and diverted to
Midwestern and Texas and non-California markets.
Secondly, the evidence made clear that for a pur­
chaser to in fact be able to compete under today's conditions
would require substantial strength or muscle, for breaking
into an established gas market is a major, a very risky and
uncertain and an extremely costly venture.
It was in the light of this type of situation that

25
21

•:

1

California, sought divestiture of not merely the assets pro­

2.

posed by El Paso, but additional assets and benefits which

3

would have afforded the divestee the strength to be aggressive

4

and to give it incentive to attempt a California project.

S

When the District Court indicated its tentative

6

choice of CIG, an applicant that vre at the outset, did not

7

choose because of its lack of past aggressive expansion, and

8

because of the possibility which had been suggested that there

9

might be a new Section 7 violation involved,

■

10

objected.

However, because of ClGEs strength and other quail'

11

fying attributes, and because of the critical need for a strong

12

divestiture now, and not months in the future, we were not

13

close minded when Colorado Interstate Gas offered a written

14

committment to attempt a California project.

15

At this point* as is indicated in the response*

I

16

the typewritten response we filed last wee, at pages 5 and 6,

17

we gave thorough detailed and intensive consideration to the

13

course of action which would best fill this court’s mandate

19

and further the interests of California at the same time.

20

!

J

II

Our Attorney General and his two top assistants
J

21

personally, and I also, had at least nine separate meetings

22

with four of the five largest California gas users, with

23

representatives of our California Public Utilities Commission,
.

24
25

and also with three prospective purchasers, including Colorado
Interstate Gas.
22

It was in light of the views expressed in these

8
2

:
meetings and our consideration of the fact that divestiture

3

now of a strong divestee was an absolute essential that we

4

proposed and by we I mean the California Attorney Generals,

5

and spearheaded negotiation of the agreement which is Exhibit A

6

to our response.

7

;]

8

And, thereafter, when the agreement was signed by
„
four of the five largest gas users in California, that we

I

withdrew the protective notice of appeal previously filed by

9

ns.

10

.

I should like to note two things concerning the

11

agreement.

12

First it is patterned on the step program contract

which Southern California Edison, an intervenor in the pro-

13

'

ceedings proposed be accepted in the proceeding by purchasers.

14

•

.

•

Second, will the exhibit appended to California's

15

i

.

response does not itself show it was signed, that is due to

16

the lack of time vie had in preparing our brief.

17

It was signed
j

by the four that we have noted.
18
It was in light of this situation, a situation where

19

j

the possibility of recreating competition in California was
20

J

fast disappearing, and with CIG a strong .and experienced gas
21
pipline operator willing to undertake the major program in22

!

■

j volved in trying to coma to California, that we dismissed our

23
| appeal.
24

.

We are extremely concerned that should the District
25
23

1

Court's decree not be sustained and not be implemented now,

2

there will be no chance left to restore competition.

3

The competition which this court

4

sought and seek.
Accordingly, it is our position and we urge the

In developing the reasons which lay behind the
position of the United States, it seams to me that it may be
helpful to summarise the process by which they were determined.

In this case, the judgment of the District Court was
rendered on August 29, 1968.

At that time I knew nothing about

25

It is not a part of the responsibility of the

Solicitor General to try cases in the District Court.

The trial

in this case had in fact begun before I had taken public
office.

24

1

The case was in charge of the anti-trust division

2

which was the appropriate place for it to be handled,, in the

3

Department of Justice.
Under the statute and rules, the notice of appeal

4
5

must be filed within 60 days after the judgment was entered.

6

That expired on October 28, 1968, and on that day a notice

7

of appeal was filed.
I knew nothing about that, made no authorization of

That would

On November 15, 1968, before the

ten-day period specified in the rules of this court, and this
was the first time that I heard about the case, an application
was presented to the Chief Justice to extend the time for
docketing the case.

|I
i
Actually, our application asked for an extention until*

January 31st, which was based upon the September 3 date when
the judgment was entered in the court’s records, but the
25

I
i

j decision of the Court was on August 29, and the Chief Justice
in granting the extension granted it. to and including
, January 26» 1969, which was the 30 days plus 60 days after
!
!
' August 29, and was the maximum extension that could be obtained «j
There was no authority to grant any further extension»

j
As a result of this application for an extension,of

I had talks with members

I read the prior decisions of this Court in

i

i

the El Paso case, and the Cascade case.

I was thoroughly
i

familiar with what might be called the traumatic experience of
the Department

of Justice in the Cascade case, and knew how

carefully, this must be handled.

1
j

I was aware, too, of the interest of a newspaper
: columnist in the matter.

It would have been an easy way out

j

for me simply to have said, "Oh, well, of course, we must

j take this appeal."
In due course, there came through from the Anti-Trust
■;

Division the recommendations with respect to the case.
Mr. Zimmerman, the Assistant Attorney General, was disqualified.!
j The recommendation came from.the deputy Assistant Attorney
I General.

It was received in my office on January 3rd, 1969»
By that time I not only was aware of the case, but I

was aware of the time problem involved in the case in connecfcion with the change of Administration, xvhich occurred on
\

January 20 th.,

If we were to file a jurisdictional statement, it had

The recommendation which came from the Anti-Trust

It then went to a member of my staff who had been
familiar with the case and who followed it, and who wrote a
memorandum on January 9th, which begins somewhat reluctantly,
"I concur in the recommendation of anti-trust that we do not

On the following day, January 10th, a supplemental

which he further supported the recommendation that no appeal

member of my staff a recommendation, "I recommend no appeal."
22

-

I took all of these memoranda, I studied them
23

carefully, and I found the question a very difficult one.
24

All of mv instincts, may I say, from the beginning were that
25

we should take the appeal.

2

I found more and more difficulties.

8

that and he presented it to me, and it then became apparent to

9

me that our position was an extremely difficult one.

I 22

In the process I examined the briefs which the
Department of Justice had filed in the District Court in this
case, the main brief, the Department said, "It has not been our
role in these proceedings or others to nominate a purchaser.
It is not our intent now to intrude in any way upon the
exercise of the broad discretion of this equity court or to
enter upon any area which has traditionally been the court's
prerogative.

It is within that limitation

that we offer the

comments which follow."

j
j

And then again on page 32 of that brief, the Government
I

j

had said, "We do not think, however, that CIG should be automatically excluded from consideration hare, because it is now

{
I

a potential competitor for the California market.
If the combination of CIG and the new company were to

23

Ij
create a considerably stronger competitor for the California

24

market than either one could possibly be alone, the Court could
25

28

j

validly conclude that such a combination is pro-competitive
rather than anti-competitive, and entirely consistent with the
mandate of the Supreme Court,
Then later following the preliminary decision of the
Court, the Department of Justice had filed a final memorandum
in which they took some exception to the fact that the Court's
findings were not adequate, but said"While we do not flatly
oppose the Court's selection of CIG, we do submit here that the
Court has not yet made findings of fact and conclusions of law
adequate to support its choice."
Thus, I was confronted with a situation where I
would have to -Q

Who wrote that memorandum, General?

United States.

s
i

Q

The Anti-Trust Division?
|

A

The Anti-Trust Division, yes, Mr. Justice.

I

was confronted with a situation where I woulS have to file a
jurisdictional statement saying that the District Court erred
because it had decided in ways which the Department of Justice

I
did not oppose.
Now, at first I found myself somewhat concerned
i
about this.

The more I thought about it, the more it seemed

to me that maybe the handling of the case in the District Court
29

j

i

had been entirely sound.
The more I thought about it, the mors it seemed to

2
3
4

5
6
1
8
9
10

me that the District Court was probably correct in saying
that CIG was the only one of the applicants who had any prospect
of producing an effective competitor in California out of this
situation.
There was further the question whether this wasn’t
anti-competitive in that there might have been two competitors
if Pacific Northwest was transferred to another company, and
CIG was left to its own resources.
It seemed tome tolerably clear that there was no

11
12

prospect that CIG by itself would become a competitor for
California.

There was little prospect that Pacific Northwest

13
transferred to another new company would become a competitor
14

for California.
15

There has been reference this morning to the embryonic
16
nature of these other companies.

It seemed apparent that all

17
or nearly all of them were speculative ventures which were
18
organized for the purpose of hoping to be able to get these
19
assets and then on them being able to realize tenough money to
2(5

develop some kind of a structure which could affectively
21

operatein the gas area, but these other companies did not have
t

22
the background or the manpower or the plans to operate and it

}

23

became more and more apparent that the best prospect of
24

effective competition for gas in California, the most likely

1ii
2

7

a

way to carry out the mandate of this court, was that which the
District judge had hit upon after the extensive trial, and
that it may well have been that the most helpful thing that
the Department of Justice could do with respect to the District
judge was to raise before him as it did, the varying factors
w hich bore upon the question whether Colorado Interstate cl­
one of the other companies would be the, provide the most
effective competition.
There were extensive discussions between me and my

B
10

11

12

associates.

The then Attorney General was aware of the situa­

tion, and understood that the decision was going to be made
before January 20.

We were aware that California had not

appealed and that the California Gas Companies had filed a motion

13
to dismiss, and the anti-trust interest was essentially in
14

California.

t

15
' We received strong representation from the States
16

and Public Utility Commissions in the Northwest that it would
17

gravely hamper their interests if there were further delay, and ,
18

that an appeal

was taken.

19
And finally on the afternoon of Friday, January 17th,
20

j

I

and I now find that I not only dated it January 17th, I
21

j

wrote 5;30 p.m. after it, and I aisnged a slip and wrote a
22
brief memorandum in which i said ‘-No appeal."
23

I should mention, too, that the Deputy Clerk of the
24
Court had issued an order in December providing that our time
25
31

1

for filing for a motion to dismiss or affirm with respect to

2

any appeal that might be taken should extend for a period of

3

30 days from the filing of a jurisdictional statement by the

4

United States, or from notice by the United States that their

5

appeal will not be perfected»

6

Since this action was taken late on Friday afternoon,

7

there was no opportunity to give notice then, Monday was a

3

holiday, and no notice was given, we were rather anxious to

keep that 30-day period open as long as possible in order that

office on Tuesday morning, January 21st, said that I didn't tell;

the Deputy Solicitor General, sent notice to all counsel in

21

the case that the Government would not perfect its appeal»
22
We then undertook consideration as to v/hat position

24
may say that I had not taken Utah's appeal very seriously into

account in determining whether we would perfect our appeal or

2

not.

It was plain that Utah had no interest with respect to

California.

interest but a very narrow one as far as we were concerned.

We worked with the Anti-Trust Division on the draft

This was approved by Mr. McLaren, the new Assistant Attorney
General.
In its final draft I approved it and marked it to go
to the printer, and it was on that day that the motion to
dismiss the Utah appeal was filed.
We understood from the Clerk’s office that a motion
to affirm would not be received, and we put our draft in our
file and did not file it.
When the Court’s order of a week ago yesterday was
issued, we brought it out and we caused it to be printed

speak, and we have filed that as an appendix to the response
which we have made.
In summary then, my position is that the best
prospect, the most likely way to ceirry out this Court’s
mandate in the Cascade Gas Case is the one which has been
adopted by the District Court in its decision in this case,

25
33

allocating these assets to the Colorado Interstate Company,
There seems to be a considerable likelihood that this may actu­
ally develop important competition with respect to gas in
!

California,
It also seems to me that this was not anti-competitive,
that neither Colorado Interstate nor the Pacific Northwest
assets in the hands of a new inexperienced company were likely
competitors in California.
In my view, the best way to carry out the decision
of this court in Cascade is to dismiss the appeal of Utah
and let the decision of the District Court go into effect.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. BENNETT, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF EL PASO NATURAL GAS COMPANY

16

MR. BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and members of this

17

Court.
18

I think it would be refreshing and helpful and novel
IS
here today to speak for the first time of the facts of the
20

case, the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, and your decisions
21

and to judge the award in that light and not so much an ad
22
hominem argument.
23

To understand this case and to know how your mandate
24

has been frustrated, it 1 is necessary to go back to the
25

35

beginning which was 1956, when there was the possibility, the
reality as you found in El Paso, of competition to California
from the Northwest»
Because of that threat of competition, El Paso
acquired the common stock of Pacific»
Now, what is relevant to these proceedings today is
that there was a meeting between El Paso and the Attorney
General of the United States in 1957, in which they were told
that there were grave anti-trust consequences in their action»
The Securities and Exchange Commission by formal letter
inquiry pointed out the anti-trust difficulties»
»

As if that were not enough, on July ?, 1957, the
Attorney General of the United States filed a complaint
entitled, "USA versus El Paso," charging that this stock
acquisition was in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.
Thereafter on August 22, 1S>57, the El Paso went
I[

to the Power Commission, filed an application there for asset
acquisition and approval, seeking to offset the effect of the
action in the District Court in Utah „
And all of this began, by the way, with an opinion
from counsel which is set forth in a prospectus on file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1956, saying in what
has to be possibly the monumental error of the decade,
"Counsel concludes that while the matter is not. entirely free
from doubt, it is their opinion that the proposed transaction
36

1

is not in violation of the anti-trust laws „t!
Thereafter, commenced proceedings before the f-iowar

2
3

Commission in which I participated for approximately eight

4

weeks, and in that proceeding in September of 1358, on behalf

5
6
7

8
9

0

of the Attorney General of the State of California, 1 filed
a motion to stay those administrative proceedings, pointing
out that it was fraught with danger to the consumers of the
West, to the shareholders of El Paso, in the event the
District Court should find this transaction violated Section 7
of the Clayton Act, which it did.
I point this out to you today because of the dis­

1

2

cussion 1 will make of the remedy I request in light of
alleged hardship or lack of notice or surprise on the part of

4

SI Paso.
They were on notice as you stated in El Paso almost

0

from the very beginning.
From the determination by the Power Commission that

i
0
9

this merger was lawful, there commenced a series of appeals
taken by California, myself having the honor to represent that
State.

In the United Stcites Court of Appeals for the District

0
of Columbua, Solicitor General Lee Lankin supported our cause
1
and told that court in oral argument, and in brief that this

t

2

merger approval by the Power Commission was improper so long
p
as there was a pending charge in the* District Court in Utah.

S

g

Thereafter came the appeal to this court, in which

37

the new Solicitor General, Mr, Cox,

•/pheld that FPC approval,

and argued against California, but y j>u found that the Federal
Power Commission could not approve '/hat merger so long as

I in

there Weis a charge pending in Utah
Nov; it is significant tc note that Justice Douglas

/

i in California versus the Federal Power Commission had this to
say, about the approval of this Merger by that Administrative

its hand until the courts hag acted,,

And that ,.s where we are today.
Following that determination in California Versus
the Power Commission, we tried the matter before Judge Ritter
in Utah, who heic there was no violation of the Clayton Act.
There came then the appeal to thiscourt, and I might add after
great pleading and persuasion, to the Department of Justice
to perfect its appeal which they finally did, almost, upon
a request made on bended knee, so to speak, in that case
Justice Douglas pointed out, having found a violation of

for acquisition.

Thera were nine applicants

The Department of Justice presented no

testimony,, no witnesses, no showing whatsoever.
It did take a position.

Its position was quite clear

for the most part. It opposed Colorado Interstate Gas Company
as an applicant, and as I have pointed out in my brief,
quoting the brief for the Government, it said it would lead

r°

n

to anti-competitive consequences.
In oral argument following the award to CXG, the

2

Department of Justice through Mr. Doherty criticized that

3
award quite clearly.

The State of Utah strongly criticized

4
that award in a brief of some 35 pages, in which it details
5
its objections, and the State of California in oral argument

before Judge Chilson concurred in the Utah criticism.

I have the transcript here in which the California

Attorney General said,

"With respect to the written objections

9
filed by Utah, I would like to advise the court that we are

convinced that they are well taken and we second it."
,1
Utah's position was quite blunt.

They said in

2
writing in that brief and orally,

"The award to CIG violates

3
the monopoly laws."

Thereafter in support of those objections made to

40

Judge ChiIson, Utah, the United States

of America, and tha

State of California filed appeals»
California dismissed first, and then the United
States, and Utah is asking to dismiss.
Now so far as Utah is concerned, you should bear in
mind that Utah in its. jurisdictional statement has told you
that the questions presented are sc substantial as to require
plenary consideration, and in the brief itself submitted by
Utah, following the argument under that topic entitled the
question is substantial, Utah again tells you that questions
presented are substantial and are entitled to plenary con­
sideration.
And plenary consideration is opposed to some re­
consideration and it means that you have before you under your
Rule 15 the complete right to give a complete review and a
complete- position since Utah has represented to you as a
sovereign state that they want a full complete review of the
matter below.
That is why they told you that questions are sub­
stantial »
Now you should also bear in mind in reviewing Utah's
request to dismiss, the consideration for the dismissal of
the appeals by Utah,

I have appended in the brief I have

submitted to you, the contract between the Governor of Utah,
its Attorney General, its regulatory Public Service Commission,
41

and the Colorado Interstate Gas Company,
It is quite plain in stating that the appeal as
dismissed in consideration of substantial bank accounts in the
State of Utah, a prominent member of the Utah community on
the Board of Directors, and a promise to purchase steel from
the steel mill of U, S, Steel at Provo, Utah,
I suggest to you that that agreement is void as
against public policy,

I can9t conceive of myself as a

California Commissioner entering into this type of contract
w ith El Paso Natural Gas Company,
I submit that the agreement to purchase steel but
i

from one mill is in restraint of trade, and as to the director­
ship all I can say about that is that there is no discernible
I3enef.it to the citizens of Utah so far as that is concerned.
But your Honors, you have before you an appeal by
a sovereign state not lightly taken.

If there were other

reasons for dismissal, we might not be here today, but the
clear stated reason advanced by the State of Utah for dis­
missing is that contract whereby these type of dubious con­
siderations are forthcoming,
I suggest to you that this court is being used so
far as Utah is concerned, that review is being sought to be
denied you, not for proper public causes but because of a
contract of this nature.
If nothing else, because of the language you set
42

oii

forth in Dixon Yates, this should be condemned for what it is,

2

an abuse of your process, a contract against public policy,

3

and something which should not be tolerated»

4

You said in Dixon Yates "A democracy is effective

5

only if the people have faith in those who govern, and that

6

faith is bound to be shattered when high officials and their

7

appointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions of

8

malfeasance and corruption."
So far as the California appeal is concerned, that

9
10

was dismissed by an agreement between the California utilities

11

and Colorado Interstate Gas Company,
I have read it and it is before you.

12

It is a

There is no escaping it.

It is as though to break up

General Motors and possibly the Justice Department by way of
example might be looking at them, we were to give General
Motors to Chrysler to compete with Ford.

Per se that v/ould

be wrong.
Or to give Southern Pacific to Union Pacific to
compete with Santa Fe.

That would be wrong, and so it is here.

Your language in El Paso quite clearly covers the
award of Pacific Northwest to CIG, because just as it was
wrong to give Pacific Northwest Pipeline Company to El Paso
in 1959, so also is it wrong in 1969 to give to Colorado
Interstate Gas company, Pacific Northwest Pipeline.

When Judge Ritter announced his plan of divestiture

7L i previously,, he was quite candid in what he was doing.

In

speaking of the proposal which he had authorized;, he said

4J

quite clearly, "You see what this plan proposes is a division

only he has failed to characterize it, but this award gives
to the Colorado Interstate Gas Company the Northwest portion
of the United States, and it gives to El Paso the Southwest
portion of the United States.
It is literally a divison of the market.

It cannot

Von5s Grocery Company.

In the Von’s Grocery Company, a mere

7 percent of market domination was condemned.
This gives to Colorado Interstate 100 percent of

Now, Judge Chilscn has done exactly the same thing,

the pipeline capacity to Northwest — not 7 percent, but 100
percent.
Under the DuPont case, that’stock ownership, not
100 percent, was struck down.

Here you have 100 percent

stock ownership and I suggest to you that under all of your
precedents, under Clayton from a literal reading, and under
45

Sherman itself, this is an unlawful award on its face — on

The payment of taxes, onerous as though they may be,

You ma.de it quite plain that where the choice is between
hardship and private injury, and the public interest and
relief and complete divestiture, you resolve it in favor of
the public interest and the tax consequences must be suffered
by the private interests, and so it is here.
And that is why I say to this court, since you meant
without delay we must view this quite simply.

It is not the plan of Colorado Interstate

Gas Company.
Other things must be said so far as Colorado
Interstate is concerned.

For 40 years they have been in

business in the Eocky Mountain area as a pipeline corporation?
and never? ever once attempted to compete for the great golden
gas market which is California.
It is almost a natural thing so to do in the pipeline

24
business? but never once did Colorado look west to California.
25
48

1

No record whatsoever of competition.
Now, so far as remedy is concerned, your Honors,

2
3

I have pointed out that the public interest is paramount

4

and the private interest is secondary.

5

to you that El Paso has known even before formal proceedings

6

going back as far as 1956 and 1957, that there would be a

7

day of reckoning.

And 1 have emphasized

8

The only way in which there can be meaning to the

9

anti-trust laws, the only way the integrity of your mandate

I 10

may be respected, is by a divestiture at once without delay

11

and so far as I am concerned by a cash sale.
Now, counsel for El Paso presented a case of

12

13
| 14

corporate hardship in terms of the terrible burdens it has had
to endure by virtue of acquiring the unlawful assets.
Let me point this out that El Paso has had the

i 15

16
I 17
:

18

income from the Northwest system ever since its date of
acquisition.

of no competition because of that acquisition.
The divestiture plan of El Paso filed on August 4,

19
20
.

21

22
| 23
34

; 25

And more than that, El Paso has had the benefit

1967, in Tab 13 thereof, points out from their figures that
the net income from the Northwest System for the calendar
year 1968 is going to be and was $3,092,000.

That is $8

million net income by virtue of having violated the Clayton
Act.
In addition to that, there is cash flow from
49

depreciation,, depletion and amortisation of $10,,123,000.
in short, a cash flow of $18 million.

Or*

And that can hardly

be described as a penalty for violating the Clayton Act.
It is a bonus.
Mow there is a certain debt to the bonus.

I assume

on it they will have to pay Federal income taxes, but other
than that it is free and clear.
So I would say to you that since El Paso has known,
ever since California versus FPC in 1962, what might occur to
it, and I am sure that they read DuPont and all those other
cases, you should make the monopoly laws effective by taking
the bonus out of violation, and not only should all of the
properties go back, all of them without exception, but as well
the income from those properties commencing with California
versus the Federal Power Commission.
Now, if that seems too harsh, you then at the very
least should begin in the year 1964, I believe it is, when
in U.S.A. versus JE1 Paso, you pronounced a clear violation
of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.
Certainly as of April 6, 1964, El Paso knew from
the Supreme Court of the United Statas that the continued
operation of the Northwest Division was in violation of the
Clayton, Act.
And we must bear in mind that but for the acquisi­
tion of Northwest by El Peso, that same income, would be going
50

to Pacific Northwest Pipeline, insofar as I am concerned in
my judgment with that income that pipeline would be in the
i California Gas market today»
I
Now, I do not say this lightly»
i

I ask you to view

i this case, lasting more than a decade, I ask you to view the
; deliberate, calculated violation by El Paso»
These are not crimes of passion.

These are knowing,

calculated acts of corporations through officers indulged
in pursuant to legal opinion, meetings, authorisations of
j directors, and all those myriad of detailed steps which must
j be gone through before a corporation decides to violate the
| Clayton Act.
If you fail to do something of this nature, then
what you are saying is that the Clayton Act is there, and the
divestiture is there, but in terms of taking the profit out
I of law violation we know of no way to do it.
The reference that I made in the brief, to the
article in that publication entitled, "Anti-Trust Law and
Economics Review" by a Dr. Kenneth G. Elzinga, has a study
therein of the unlawful acquisitions over the past three years,
pointing out that in each and every one of them there was a
purchase in one year for a certain dollar figure.
There was a divestiture three or four years later,
and a great increase in property value, and a great increase
in profit to the corporation, as well as the unlawful income

It is not harsh,

Now, if your Honors please, there is something which
must be discussed here about this case and your mandate,
and that is the history of it, the frustrations of it, and
the delays of it.
When I come here sometimes, it occurs to me that you
only see the top of the iceberg and that we are here simply

because we filed the proper pleadings, and I come before you,

address you and then leave.
But this case represents an abuse of the economic
and therefore the political power of the world's first natural
gas pipeline company,
The very appeal 1 took to you in California versus
FPC was made below on theSOth and last day.

Why?

Because of

the great influence of El Paso in my State, persuading public
officials there should be no appeal.
And but for the perseverance we would never have had
California versus FPC, and we wouldnever but for that case
have had returned to our State $155

agreement.
Wow it seems to me that in view of all I have said
about the time, the delay, the contracts, the dubious
arrangements, that this is one case in which the court should
he quite severe in its judgment, and should be quits prompt
in ordering divestiture, and should take the profit out of

profits since the decision of this court in U, S, versus

If it is

Why should we in view of our mandate, why should

we take any action on this appeal until we know what is

A

Because the only way that we can compete is

the way we are competing.

As you pointed out, competition is

for the incremental demand.
Q

I am not at that point yet.

I am thinking

about the order to get into California you have to go out and
get some gas reserves?
A

Right?

First we have to go and gat some customers.

And we are doing that.
Q

But you have to get gas reserves, too.

A

We have to do that as well.

Q

Does the gas reserves that you have, as I

understand the District Court, are sufficient to servies’ only
the Northwest properties, is that right?
A

Well may I give you a little fuller answer,

Mr. Justice, to what we have been doing.
53

Let me say in more

2

competing for California in the only effective way competition

3

can occur in this industry,,

date intensively, to see whether there is room in that market
to buy gas from us three or four years from now, if we are
in a position to deliver it.
As you know, and as you have pointed out, in this
kind of business, it isn’t like selling groceries on the corner
grocery store.

It is for the incremental demand only that we

can compete.
Wow, we have dedicated trained, knowledgeable people
which is one of the fortunate things about —Q

I am not imputing motives or anything like that,

A

I realise that,

Q

I am just saying the cold reality is that a

year from now we may end up where we started,
A

It is possible.

It may be that the competition

in California, today, which is much more difficult than it was
56

ten years ago, is so entrenched that we can’t get in there,
maybe, but 1 say if the new company is going to get in there
at all, and compete, it will be under our control and with
our help because there is no other way it can do it.
That is my point.
We stand ready, assuming we can develop that market
so that we know we have got customers for gas we can deliver
in three or four years, to go out and get the reserves.
We are negotiating very actively, very actively
for reserves right now in competition with others, which if we
get them will be ample to supply this market.
But with every day of delay our problem of getting
access to sufficient reserves to move into the California
market becomes more difficult.

The competitive handicap is

greater.
How, if we have reasonable assurances that we have
the business, we have the customers, and these people are
interested in talking with us about meeting their needs in the
future — not all of them obviously — not all of them — but
snough to make the project feasible — and we can get the
reserves on which we are currently working very hard on, then
ve are planning a pipeline 'which will cost about $250 million

zo move this gas to California.
But there is nothing we can do over and beyond what
ve are doing.

There is nothing anybody else can do.
57

There is

nothing anybody else can do»

There is no way to go in and

sign up a contract today to deliver gas in three years and
guarantee that you can do that until you know you have got the
market and you can get the gas and you can finance the pipeline.
And this is a complicated and difficult business in
which to move,

It, is very difficult to compete particularly

when you are competing for the incremental demand»
As your Honor knows, what do you do with the re­
serves in the meantime»
Q

You have to pay or take them*

I would think you would be making a strong

argument to a District Court not to approve a plan at this

why should we go out and spend very substantial amounts of
money to try to make it work»

reserves, engineering talent, and we have been at this for some
time, we have got to have some optimism, that if we are capable
we will get the rewards that comes.

I
Colorado is a hard-headed company.

They have been

: interested in acquiring these facilities because they are
58

'

convinced it is the only way they can compete in the California
market.

They have known for years,, and the record is abundantly

clear, they couldn't do it without these facilities and they
will not do it.
It is either do it this way or they can't do it at
all.

Now, obviously, the new company, Northwest, divested to

some new owner who by the way would pay "cash" for say 20
percent of the stock and then try and sell stock to raise
the money to do it,

There isn’t any other contender for these

properties who has got the wherewithal, the resources in
management, the skills and the experience to do this.
That is why Judge Chilson chose our company, and
that is why he thought we would be the most effective entrant.
But -the commitment, Mr. Justice, fee enter into this market
runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
'

So that is why we were happy to give California that
agreement, in which we outlined the particular program we
would follow to try to get as soon as possible to the con­
clusion that we could do the job.
That is the reason.

We couldn’t do it any other way.

It is impossible for anybody to do it any other way.

We

can’t go out and acquire the reserves before we have the

i
market because the reserves can become surplus and you pay and j

leave it in the ground or take.

That isan enormous financial

And the reserves required for this are tremendous*.

So we have to go forward in steps,

We have to have

an assurance of the market, and if we can deliver, and then
3

we have to go out and get the gas to be sure that we can meet

4

that market and then we have to build $250 million pipeline

5

to gat the gas to the customers.
That is the kind of competition I think, Mr, Justice,

you were talking about.

the California market, because in the feelings of the California

And the California customers today are benefiting

12

from our threat to enter the California market in their present

IS

negotiations,
It is competition at work in this complicated induetry ,

14
15

So I say to your Honor that if there is any way to set up a

m

viable competitor, a new competitor for California, it has got

the program is feasible.

It is a bold project and we are

Canada.

I don't want to mention where because we are in

competition and there are two other large companies right now
engaged in negotiating for reserves, to the extent that if
they get them, obviously we will not have access to them for
ours.
Q

Was 1 wrong today, 1 thought I heard someone

say that there had been lines built or would be lines built,
pipelines from California to Texas»
A

Well, that certainly is not part of our plan

That would be other competitors.

A

That is right.

of entry.

That would be other competitors.

You see, since the 10 years when this matter was first gone
into, when you had one company, you have now got three, and
those three companies if I can just take one minute more
Q

I was interested in that because of sending

gas to Texas.
A

The three companies who now confront us in the

California market would be El Paso.

Now El Paso, even after

this divestiture, will have five times our revenues and it is
twice our size.
The second company confronting us in California is
?exas Eastern and Trans-Western.

They have over five times

I our earnings and they are twice our sise.

They are in the

The third is Pacific Gas and Electric and Pacific

way to do it.
Q

Is the PPG now allowing pipelines to be built
i

from Texas to California and from California back to Texas?
A

I can't give you a complete answer? Mr. Justice.

There have been authorized enlargements of the facilities now

j

in California? which have been approved by the Federal Power
Commission.

.

j

We? of course? have our applications pending for
certificates to take over the operation of Northwest? and all
the FPC is waiting for there is for this court's disposition
i
of this problem.
And then I believe we shall have very promptly the
certificates and be lawfully entitled to operate the Northwest

properties .
Now, we have not filed any application yet.
Q

Those properties will take you down to Oregon,

but not. to California.
A

Yes, your Honor.

But not to California.

We are not in a position to file an application
yet for a new pipeline company because of the two threshold
questions.

!
Can we gat enough market and

can we get enough of

the incremental demand to make the project feasible, and if so,
can we get enough gas to supply it, and where is the gas
omingcfrom?
We are far enough down the road so that the California
Interstate Executives believe it is still feasible to become
a worthwhile competitor in the California market, but only
by doing it this way.
Otherwise, the program is impossible.
They could not and wouldrofc attempt to do it by
themselves without the facilities which they propose to acquire
her© with this courtes permission.
Q

You stated that you had to build a pipeline

from Canada to California,

1 think you misstated the record

a bit didn't you because your pipeline runs down to Oregon
now?
A

Well, there is a segment, Mr. Justice, if we get
63

access to the reserves we are now negotiating for.

be a segment of pipeline that will have to be built in

3

Canada as well as in the United States.

4

If

There will

ray recollection is correct, I think the total

5

line of the pipeline involved, the total mileage of the

6

pipeline that would be involved is something like 2,000 miles.

It is a considerable pipeline and it will cost $250 million.

V.

e

To get that kind of financing, obviously vie have to

lave some market and we have got to have some contracts and we

iave got to have some reserves at hand.

?

Mow may 1 just make one other observation.

2

All of the mystery that has been created about the

3

Jt&h contract by counsel and the California contract, I think

4

: can dismiss very briefly as I think the Court should, when

K

our executives testified in the District Court before Judge
Chilson they described what Colorado's policy was generally,
and what they would do generally.
They mentioned that it was company policy as it was
aid is to try and put local men on Boards of Directors, to
encourage local participation wherever the pipeline runs, and
•that they were going to do and that they had done.
The Utah contract which the Attorney General of Utah
and the Governor regards as in the local economic interest of
Utah most, certainly is, but it has no anti-trust significance.
l:hr was it kept a secret.

It was announced by the Governor

64

publicly.
The other thing is this reference to the so-called
secret California agreement by counsel is absurd.

In the

papers before this Court counsel makes much of the fact that
he couldn’t find a copy of this so-called secret agreement.
All he had to do was to call us up.

It has been on

file at the Federal Power Commission for months, and a public
record.

That is why we appended both of them to our pages.

The Utah agreement and the California agreement, so that your
Honors could see there was nothing vicious or corrupt or
wrongful about either one.
They are perfectly normal and sensible agreements.
I am sure that we take as much pride in both of them as
California does and Utah do.

Their officials are very proud

of them and so are we.
X have nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice.
Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice Warrens

Very well.

We will recess.
(Whereupon, at 11s50 a.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded, the Court recessing, to
reconvene at 10 a.m. Monday, May 5, 1969»)
