ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

No. 463, National Labor-

MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
This case presents a question of administrative law,

to
11

perhaps more suitable to discussion by a law school seminar then

12

meriting extensive consideration by this Court because I believe

13

that there are decisions of the court which, though not directly

14

authoritatively in point, point the way to the decision which

15

should be reached.
The legal problem began in 1966 when the National

16
17

Labor Relations Board decided the case of Excelsior Underwear

18

in 156 N.L.R.B.

19

This opinion appears in full twice in the papers befor

20

the court, and once as Appendix C to the Petition for Certiorari

21

at pages 14-A through 33-A, and also in the Appendix or record

22

at pages 12 to 28.
The Excelsior case involved a representation election

23
24

proceeding under Section 9(c)(1) of the National Labor Relations

25

Act.

The vote went strongly against the Labor Union petitioner
2

1

in that case and it filed objections to the conduct of the

2

election.

3

One of the objections was, and I quote from page 13

4

of the Appendix, "The employer's conduct in refusing — right

5

at the middle of the page

6

refusing to supply the Union with a list of employees and

7
3

their addresses, for the purpose of allowing the Union to
answer the letter referred to in Objection No. 1."
In due course the Excelsior case and another case

9
10

11
12
13
14
15
16

19

I quote from page 14 of the Appendix, this, too, being in the
Excelsior opinion, that the employer's denial of the petitioner's
request for the names and addresses of employees eligible to
vote in the elections in these two cases, presented a question
of substantial importance in the administration of the National
Labor Relations Act.
The Board then invited further briefs on this issue
from the parties, and also invited other interested parties to
file briefs amicus and to participate in the oral argument.
Q

came before the Board for a hearing and it determined, and here

"The employer's conduct in

Right there, Mr. Solicitor General, was it the

Board which selected this group which should receive invita­
tions?
A

As I understand it, Mr. Justice, it was.

Q

In other words, unlike a rule-making procedure,

23
24

4

this was not left open for anybody interested to file?
25
3

1

A

It says that the Board invited certain interested

2

parties to file briefs, it was not like the rule-making pro­

3

cedure where there is a notice and whoever becomes aware of

4

that notice can participate in filing briefs»
Q

3

6

I see, these were invitations to a somewhat

exclusive group?
A

7

Yes, but a rather representative group»

There

8

were two National Employers Associations and six labor unions

9

which participated»

But I agree it is not the procedure

10

prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act for rule-making»

11

If it had bean the case would not be here.
Arguments were held on May 20th, 1965, and on the

12
13

basis of the briefs and oral arguments the Board entered its

14

decision on February 4, 1966»

15

Appendix.

That appears on page 33 of the

In its decision the Board concluded that higher
standards of disclosure then we have heretofor imposed are
necessary and it established a requirement that will be applied
in all election cases, quoting from page 17 of the Appendix»
Q

Did it apply them in that case?

A

That is the point, Mr» Justice, it did not.

Under this requirement, let me state the requirement
and then state what is next.
Under this requirement, quoting, "Within seven days
after the Regional Director has approved a consent election
4

■

1

agreement the employer must file with the Regional Director an

2

election eligibility list containing the names and addresses

3

of all of the eligible voters and this information is then

4

made available to all of the parties in this caseo”
Now, in answer to Mr» Justice Harlan's question, I

5

0

refer to Footnote 5 of the Board's opinion on page 17, the

7

second paragraph of that footnote.

8

The same thing also appears later at the conclusion

9

of the opinion on page 27, but what the Board said there was,

10

"However the rule we have here announced is to be applied

11

prospectively only.

12

but only in those elections that are directed or consented to

13

subsequent to 30 days from the date of this decision.

14

pose this brief period of delay to insure that all parties

15

to forthcoming representation elections are fully aware of

IS

heir rights and obligations as here stated."
Q

17

It will not apply in the instant cases

We im­

So the affect of this was to prevent any judicial

!

18

review of the Excelsior case itself, I suppose, because the

19

Excelsior case decided in favor of the employer, didn't it,

20

and the only way you could have — in other words, the employer

21

22
23
24
25

then had no duty to bargain with the union.
A

There was no opportunity for judicial review in

the Excelsior case.
Q

Yes, that is what I mean.

A

But I see no reason why there can’t be judicial
5

1

review of the propriety of the regulation,

2

briefed it and our opponents have briefed it of the order in

3

the Wyman-Gordon case or whatever other case is taken up,

4

9

Indeed,, we have

My question was directed to the practical effect

5

of what the Board did in the Excelsior case by writing an

6

opinion in favor of the unions and making a decision in favor

7

of the employer.

8

The Board, in fact, deliberately or otherwise, good

9

or bad, rightly or wrongly, significantly or insignificantly,

10

did prevent judicial review of its opinion and ruling in that

11

case,
A

12

It precluded review in that case.

Indeed, there

13

is not generally judicial review of orders of representation

14

cases,
Q

15

IS

Well, except by refusal to bargain and here the

decision was that the employer had no duty to bargain,
A

17

That is not the representation case.

That would

18

be a subsequent unfair labor practice case which might arise

19

as a consequence of the decision in the Excelsior case, but

20

in this case there was no such subsequent unfair labor practice

21

case,

22
23
24
25

Q

But in the Excelsior case the employer could not

have been guilty of a refusal to bargain because the decision
in that case

unless I have misunderstood what you said —

was in favor of the employer that he did not have to recognise
6

1

the Union»

2

A

I agree, Mr. Justice, at a later time, a year

3

later for example, if the employer had been ordered to bargain

4

it couldhave had a review.

5
6

There is potential review in this case which arose sis
months later.
This was the background of the present case which

1
8

began on July 12, 1966, about five months after the Excelsior

9

case was decided when the International Union of Boilermakers

10

filed a petition seeking to represent the employees of the

11

respondent company.
Another union also intervened.

22

The Regional Director

23

determined that an election should be held and he directed that

14

the company as required by the Board9s Excelsior decision

15

furnish a list of the names and addresses of the eligible

16

voters„

17

The company refused to furnish the list.

The electior

18

was held and the unions lost.

29

the company's failure to provide the list of names and addresses

20

and this objection was sustained by the Regional Director and

21

by the Board.

22
23
24
25

The unions objected because of

The Regional Director again directed the company to
provide an employee list.
When the company again refused the Regional Director
issued a subpoena requiring the company to produce its books
7

1

and records showing the nantes and addresses of its employees,

2

or in the alternative, to furnish a list containing that

3

information.

4

The Board denied the company's motion to quash the

3

subpoena.

0

brought an action in the United States District Court for the

7

District of Massachusetts to enforce the subpoena or in the

8

alternative for a mandatory injunction directing the company

9

to comply with the Excelsior requirement.

When the company still refused to comply, the Board

10

And that is this case.

11

The District Court granted an order enforcing the

12

subpoena„
Q

13
14

Mr. Solicitor, 1 suppose that question is here

or whatever you do with the Excelsior?

13

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think it is here.

10

Q

Even if that rule had never been announced I

17

suppose

18

subpoena which it thinks it is authorised and the other side

19

doesn't.

20

in a proceeding like this that the Board issues a

But we have got to decide that question.
A

Well, that is one argument which I hope to

21

advance that at least the Excelsior opinion is a great dictum

22

upon which the Board can rely in making a later decision,

23

which is this case.

24
23

In this case where it is charged with an investi­
gation, as a part of the process of carrying out fair
8

1

representative elections, it has determined that this company

a

should provide a list of names and addresses and when that

3

has not been provided it has started this proceeding in court

4

to enforce its determination which, as Mr, Justice White

5

suggests, is before this court now»

6

Q

But wouldn’t this power to issue a subpoena be

7

— if you decided the same way I suppose even though the

a

Excelsior rule had never been announced?

A.

9

It seems to me you might well»

I think the

10

warning of the Excelsior rule eliminates arguments about

11

fiarness which might surprise, which might be made an answer

12

to something which came simply in this case, but I know of no

13

reason why the Board could not have made no Excelsior decision

14

but have decided in this case that Wyman-Gordon should pra'sdie

13

a list of names and addresses and have started proceedings to

16

enforce that decision»

17

Q

Would it need to operate under the rule which

10

it announced by subpoena, would it just issue an order, could

19

it itself issue an order or what?

A

20

Or is that what, a subpoena

I believe, Mr» Justice, that the only orders

21

that the Board can issue which are susceptible as such of

22

enforcement in the courts are orders in unfair labor practice

23

cases»

24
25

Beyond that it has the power to issue subpoenas,
it also has the power to make orders which it can seek to have

9

i

1

enforced in the District Courts under the power of the District

2

Courts to enforce orders made by agencies engaged in the

3

regulation
Q

4

Well then*, does having made a rule like in the

5

Excelsior case give them any more powers in that respect?

e

suppose it doesn't.
A

7

I think perhaps analytically it does not.

I

It

8

certainly provides a helpful background to sustain the pro­

9

priety of the order in that people have had adequate notice.
But I think that vie might have very much the same

10

11
12
13

case here without the Excelsior decision in which event we
would not have problems under the Administrative Procedures Act
and things of that sort.
Q

14
15
16

rule-making proceeding which no one questioned,, the Board would
still have an enforcement problem* wouldn't it?

17
18
19
20
21

22
23

If the rule had been enacted or adopted in a

A

The Board would still have an enforcement prob­

Q

Just like this one.

A

Which would be very similar to what it has here.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General* in the other cases in­

lem -----

volving the Excelsior rule, did the question arise similarly,
that is to say, as a consequence of a particularised order
issued, in the particular case?

24

A

Yes, Mr, Justice.

25
10

There are five decisions of

1

Courts of Appeals sustaining the Excelsior rule and sustaining

2

orders of the District Court to enforce it and all of them are

3

cases analogous to this.

4

Q

There has never been an attempt to enforce the

5

Excelsior rule as a rule, that is for example, has the Board

6

ever instituted,

7

for failure to comply with the rule absent an order in a

8

particular case?

9

A

To the best of my knowledge there has not been

10

such a case.

11

Courts of Appeals»

12

3
4

Q

st us say, an unfair practice proceeding

Certainly there has been no such case in the

As

understand it, is it your submission that

the failure would be an unfair labor practice?
A

Yes, Mr, Justice, I think it would, but the

5

unfair labor practice proceeding is somewhat complicated and

6

prolonged and makes it very difficult to to carry out elections

7

promptly which is the Board's duty under Section 9 of the Act„

8
9
20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

In cases so far, as I understood your answer

to Mr» Justice Fortas, have all arisen as this one did, that is
by and in all the other cases the District Courts enforced the
Board's efforts to require the employer to furnish the list»
Is that right?
A

I think there is one

District Court decision

in New Jersey which refused to enforce it»

All of those which

have gone to the Courts of Appeals the Board's effort to enforce
11

1
2

has been sustained except for this case»

This case went to

the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in an opinion by

3

Chief Judge Aldrich, the District Court was reversed but Judge

4

Coffin dissented.
The basis of Judge Aldrich's opinion was that because

5

6

the Excelsior requirement was made prospective only it was rule­

7

making rather than decision and that it was invalid since it

S

had not been promulgated in accordance with the procedures

9

provided in the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Court also held that the Excelsior Rule was not

10

II

"procedural'1 in quotation marks, but was substantive and thus

12

that it did not come within an expressed exception in the

13

Administrative Procedure Act for procedural matters.

14

Judge Coffin dissented on this point, too.
Now, we come to consideration of the legal question

15
16
17
18
19

20

21
22
23
24
25

involved.

It requires consideration of the language of the

National Labor Relations Act arid of the Administrative
Procedure Act.

Some portions of these two statutes are set out

in Appendix A of our brief on pages 55 to 60.
Unfortunately, despite the detail of these statutes,
there is nothing in them that sheds much light on the precise
problem now before the Court.
The Administrative Procedure Act does tell an agency
how to conduct rule-making proceedings.

It does tell it what

procedures to follow in an adjudicatory proceeding, but it does
12

j

1

really tell when a matter is one or the other»

2

to me, has to be determined out of more general principles»

3

5

6

8
9
10
11
12

Q

That, it seems

This was never published in the Federal Register

was it, the Excelsior rule?
A

Mo, Mr» Justice, because it didn't follow the

Administrative Procedure Act procedure»
Q

Well, on this — another alternative theory,

you are not contending that this is rule-making?
A

Mo, Mr» Justice, we are contending that it is

adjudication and therefore did not need to follow the procedure»
Q

Do you also contend that even though it is

adjudication and not rule-making that it has a self-contained

13

imperative in the sense that absent an order in a particular

14

ca.se an effected party would have to comply with this?

15
16

A

It is the background for an order in a particular

case with which the party, we submit, must comply„
i

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

0

But absent an order in the particular case you

would not contend that there is an obligation on an affected
company to comply with it, would you?
A

Yes, Mr» Justice, I think there is, just as a

decision of this Court establishes the law, the decision of the
National Labor Relations Board in the Excelsior case established
ways of administering this particular statute with whose
administration the Board is charged and we think that all
employers are under a legal obligation to comply with it»
13

1

Q

Well* then you are saying that the effect of

2

the Excelsior rule* even though it was adjudication* is the

3

same as if it were an exercise of rule-making power?

4

A

1 think I will say the same»

1 was about to

5

say much the same* but it is the same as a rule established by

6

adjudication* which is much the same as that of one established

7

by rule-making»

Q

But you don't change or amend a rule-making rule

by an adjudication* do you?
A

Were this an amendment of a rule* Mr» Justice*

it might be more difficult»
Q

Yes.

A

There is one decision of this court which in­

volves that to which I will refer later.

This is the estab­

lishment of a way of dealing with election representation cases
as a result of the Board's experience* which in our view was
appropriately adjudicatory in nature.
The National Labor Relations Board, the National
Labor Relations Act gives the Board broad powers to administer
the Act and we know from the Chinnery case of more than 20 years
ago that such powers are to be construed broadway* that they
can be exercised by decisions of the administrative agency*
reached in adjudicatory proceedings* it is true that the
decision in the Chinnery case was applicable to that case.
Indeed, that was part of the problem there.
14

It was

1

not prospective only* but there is much in this Court.5s opinion

2

in the Chinnary case which would suggest the result for which

3

we contend here.

4

Excelsior case.

There was here an actual controversy in the

There was a hearing* as required by Section 9(c)(1)

5

s

of the National Labor Relations Act.

?

briefing and oral argument and a full reasoned opinion by the

8

Board.

9

There was extensive

In its opinion the Board reached a conclusion as to

10

the appropriate rule of decision for such cases.

11

because of considerations of fairness to the parties then before

12

it that rule should be applied only to subsequent cases.

13

But then held

We submit that the Board in the Excelsior case was

14

engaged in adjudication and that the .result which it reached in

15

determining that controversy was validly arrived at in the

16

process of adjudication.

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

It was a real case* there was no feigned issue* no
effort by the Board to make rules simply because it thought
:hatu would be a good idea.

The matter was handled in an adjudi­

catory proceeding with all the care and safeguards required
for the appropriate consideration and resolution of a case.
Out of that consideration the Board came to a conelusion which it announced as its decision* with careful
reasoning to support it.

The decision represented a departure*

as decisions often do* and the Board concluded that the solution

15

1

it reached should be applied prospectively only..

2

Q

Mr. Solicitor General;, is this a unique situation

3

A

No, Mr. Justice.

4

Q

Is there anything else like it in Board practice?

5

A

As to the National Labor Relations Board I aro

6

not aware of any other thing like it.
Q

7
8

so far as you know, that has done something like this?
A

9
10

13

Q

16

Probably it may be different.

I just wondered

if you knew of anything where the same and curious situation
occurred.
A

14

15

No, but there are many courts -- there may be

administrative agencies, I don't know.

11
12

Well, is there any other administrative agency,

No, I don't know of anything either in the Labor

Board or in other administrative agencies.

Nevertheless in

determining what is adjudication, it seems to me not inappropri­
ate to look to what courts do.

17
Decisisns which are prospectixre only in their opera-

18
19
20

ion hfeve been known in this court at least as far back as the
Sunburst Oil and Refining case in 287 U.S., some 35 years ago.
In recent years this Court, has frequently decided

21

that certain decisions should and can be applied prospectively
22
only.

No.one has supposed that the Court was not adjudicating

23
and not acting as a court when it did so.

Several of these

24
cases are cited on pages 22 and 23 of this brief.
25
16

1

I haven't had a chance to study the opinions, but

2

Allen against the State Board of Elections decided this morning

3

appears to be another one.
And perhaps the cases closest to the present situation

4
5

are England against the Louisiana State Board of Medical

6

Examiners, in 375 U.S., and James against the United States in

7

366 U.S., in both of which this Court announced rules.
In the James case it was overruling an earlier case

8
9

and in the England case it was clarifying a situation which

10

was uncertain somewhat as in the Excelsior case.

In each case

11

the Court for one reason or another, reasons of fairness to the

12

parties in the particular case, announced that the rule would

13

not be applied in this case.
In the England case this Court's words were, "On the

14
15

record in the instant case the rule we announce today would

16

call for affirmance of the District Court's judgment but we

17

are unwilling to apply the rule against these appellants."
No one has ever contended that in the England case or

18
19

in the James case that the court was engaged in rule-making.

20

On the contrary, in both cases this court was acting as a court,

21

22
23

it was deciding the cases then before it, and articulating the
somewhat complicated reasons which led it to the conclusion
which it then reached.
Neither the England case rr>r the James case is dealt

24
25

with in the Respondent's brief here.

I should point out,

however, that the Respondent cites one case in his brief which

Court dismissing an effort by the Interstate Commerce Commission
to enforce an order because in that case the Interstate
Commerce Commission had made an order far broader than the
matters before the Commission.
Indeed, the Commissioner's Hearing Examiner had said
that these matters are not involved in this case and no con­
sideration has been given to them and when the matter went to
the Commission the Commission issued a broad order applicable
not only to the case but to the whole field.
The District Court refused to enforce an order based
on that and this Court affirmed it per curiam.
Q

That case arose, I gather just from reading its

description in the Respondent’s brief as though this we have
before us now, the Excelsior case itself, is that right?

20
A

No, I think not, Mr. Justice.

Q

Well, it says in that case the lower court

21

upheld the promulgation of a rule for future application, done
23

in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding.

The other parties then sued to prevent the

This Court

This would strike at the theory of the Federal

Register Act? wouldn’t it, that is to say that here the
Federal Register Act is a company subject to the National Labor
Relations Act to find out what the rules are and consult the
Federal Register and rely with confidence on what appears
there.
I am sure you as well as I remember the controversy
that led to that.

And here what you are saying is that they

also have to consult

idle adjudicated cases, not merely to find

principles, but also to find specific and detailed rules such
as this Excelsior rule?
19

1

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, 1 don't think the Federal

a

Register Act has anything to do with it.

3

upon by the Respondents.

4

It hasn't been relied

One has to look to many things besides what is in

5

the Federal Register to learn what the law is, including the

6

decisions of this Court.

7

Moreover, the Federal Register Act expressly provides

8

that its rule that an unpublished regulation is not binding, is

9

not applicable to a person who has actual notice of the rule

10

and there isn't any doubt that Wyman-Gordan had actual notice

11

of this rule and deliberately chose not to comply with it.

12

13
14
15

So, I don't 'think the Federal Register Act has any­
thing to do with it.

The problem of how you find out what the

law is, I suppose, is the lawyer's problem and 1 would suggest
fh&t anybody involved in a labor case should look to the decisions

16

as well as to the rules because for better or for worse the

17

National Labor Relations Board has never proceeded in the

18

rule-making basis and there is no material in the Federal

19

Register on this.

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF QUENTIN O. YOUNG, ESQ»

16

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

17

MR» YOUNGs

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please the

18

Court, I apologise for ray voice today, but I have had laryngitis;

19

or something for the last week and I can't speak very well»

20

I would like to direct myself to the question that

21

you asked the Solicitor General as to why the Board does not use

22

the rule-making powers»

23

I think one of the reasons is explicit here because

24

they developed the Excelsior rule in a fashion and in a manner

25

which it was not directly subject to court review either by the

21

1

Excelsior Company or by any other company in the country that

2

was involved in the various Excelsior cases.

3

The Solicitor General has indicated that the Wyman-

4

Gordon Company refused and refused and refused as though we were

5

doing something illegal in not complying with the Board's

6

Excelsior rule.

7

Actually we were doing the only thing which we could

8

do in order to test the Excelsior rule because of the way the

3

Board had promulgated it.

10

I think that the Administrative Procedure Act, and

11

the National Labor Relations Act, snake it very clear -that the

12

Board should and must follow the Administrative Procedure Act

13
14
15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

in promulgating its rules, even though it has arbitrarily for
the last 30-odd years refused to follow this position.
You asked a question as to whether an attorney
representing a client could look to the Federal Register and
find out what the Board's rules were or whether it would be
necessary for him to go into the cases.
Well actually, 1 have found across the years that
when I advise a client on Friday of what he can do under the
National Labor Relations Act, I must also advise him that on
Monday morning I may change my opinion and tell him what he
could do on Friday he couldn't do on Monday.
I think the Board, and now I am getting away from ray
argument, the Board should be required to follow the Administrat.;;

25
22

1

Procedure Act because it is the duty of the Board to stabilise

2

labor relations in this nation.

3

Actually what they have done by proceeding on an

4

ad hoc basis, they have unstabilized labor relations.

5

point that lawyers advise their client at their peril and I

6

think that if the Board would make extensive use of the rule-

7

making power all of this confusion would be

The

An order was issued against you in this specific

A

I am sorry, I didn't —

11

I say an order was issued against you in this

case,

12

13

Excelsior procedure,

14

A

Well, that order, if you call it that, sir

13

Q

Well, wasn't it an order?

16

A

Well, it was in effect that when the Board sends

17

notice that a petition for election has been filed it also sends

13

notification in regard to the Excelsior list so that the only

19

way we could test Excelsior is by refusing to give the Excelsior

20

list to the Board,

21

Q

And I suppose you would agree that you really

22

have to contest two things here; one, you hope you can contest

23

the Excelsior order as improper rule-making, but you have also

24
23

got to contest the validity of the order issued in this par­
ticular case even if it had never appeared in the Excelsior23

1

litigation?

2

A

3

1 would like to get back here to my argument.

4

In Section 6 the National Labor Relations Board is

specifically directed to use* to make front time to time amend

6

and rescind in a manner prescribed by the Administrativa

7

Procedure Act such rules and regulations as may be necessary to

a

carry out the provisions of this subcontract.

9

This is what we contend the Board did in Excelsior

10

and it has not followed the rule established in the Administrati

11

Procedure Act in Sections 4 and 5 whereby all agencies9 rules

12

and regulations of a general policy nature must be published and

13

a hearing held in accordance with the provisions of the

14

Administrative Procedure Act.

I think that what is most important ——

20

21
22
23
24
25

Mr. Young* is it your suggestion that this is

the only way the Board could proceed
A

No* that is not my position, but it is my posi-

t ion that this is a rule of the nature that, should have been
published following the Administrative Procedure Act.
Q

You say no it isn5t the only way

A

I recognise the fact that the agency has a right

to make rules in an adjudicatory fashion.
Q

Could it make this one in adjudicatory contacts

without purporting to --24

A

!

It is our contention that it is improper

2

adjudicatory rule-making here because they decided the case one

Excelsior is concerned —Q

I suppose that they certainly have decided

yours against you?
A

7

Well# they have made no decision as such.

Q

Why not?

10

A

Because they haven’t.

12

I refused to give them

the list when the soul purpose is to turn around and hand it to
the Union.

13

Q

And then what did the Board do?

14

A

Then the Board issued a subpoena.

15

18

19

20

And so -they

got out a subpoena and we had the validity of that subpoena

25

Q

invalid is because of the Excelsior rule?
A

3

We claim that the Excelsior rule is invalid,

that the list is not subject to subpoena powers of -the District

A

Mo, sir, the way the Board's order reads, it is

based solely upon Excelsior, and they have proceeded to seek
the subpoena on the basis of Excelsior, that the list con­
stitutes evidence.
It is our contention that the lists are not evidence
and are not subject to subpoena powers of the District Courts.

I suppose even if their rule they adopted was

not valid they might in this case have said, "Well, we think in

as cited by the Solicitor General* and set forth in our briefs
on April 2nd* in 1965* and this is a quote* direct quote from
the Excelsior decision* ■ the Board decided* "These two cases
presented the question of substantial importance in the adminis­
tration of the National Labor Relations Act,"
Now, if they can make a statement like that in their

13

\1
18

own decision* I don51 see how they can avoid the rule-making
requirements of Section 6,
The Board* in effect* in inviting certain parties to

19
29
21

22
23
24
25

file briefs* was giving lip service to the Administrative
Procedure Act.

I think it is interesting to review the invitees
;

who were asked to participate as amicus in the Excelsior
decision.

The Board invited* as interested parties* the

Chamber of Commerce of the United States* the AFL-CIO* the
XUE, the National Association of Manufacturers* Retail Clerks*
27

!
2

Textile Workers Onion and Teamsters Union.
I submit even on the basis of the interested parties

3

that the Board invited to file amicus briefs,, that the cards

4

were stacked against the employers.

5

The Board in its brief on page 15 argues that it is

6

impractical for the Board to follow the Administrative Procedure

7

Act because the procedure is too rigid and too inflexible for

8

it to proceed in the industrial relations field.

9

Actually this statement in the Board8s brief on page

10

15 is a gross misstatement of the law, because the Board under

n

Section 6 has specific and explicit authority to make any rule

12

and any regulation that it wishes.

13

The argument that the APA procedure is too inflexible

14

just will not stand up under scrutiny of Section 6 of the Act.

15

The Board has placed a great deal of emphasis in its brief and

16

its argument on the Chenery case.

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

But it is this exact case that Judge Aldrich in the
First Circuit found distinguishable and upon which he was able
to strike down the Excelsior rule.

The Chenery case was a

decision between an agency and an individual group.
The decision was applicable to that group and to that
case and also for future operation.

Excelsior, however, the

Board decided the case in one way, in an adjudicatory pro­
ceeding, and then used that as a vehicle for announcing an
absolutely free new rule which had never been applied in any

In discussing their failure to follow the

the Administrative Procedure Act.

I think this is a complete misstatement of their

obligations under the Act to Congress.

the Board in Section 6 to establish rules and to amend rules

and to rescind rules through the use of the Administrative

23

Procedure Act and yet the Board arbitrarily over the years has

taken no notice of its obligations under Section 6.

Congress has directed

The Board again tries to say that there was no

rule in the future rather than in the past.

advantage because the only way Excelsior can be challenged is

by the means that we have adopted here,
I think I would like to get back to Excelsior itself

and the purposes of it.
The Board claims that the purpose of Excelsior is

10

twofold.

One is to improve communications between unions and.

11

employees who may be prospective union members, and to minimise

12

the challenges that may follow a Board-conducted election.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF QUENTIN O. YOUNG, ESQ.

1

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. YOUNG;

8
9
10

I would like to discuss briefly the

Excelsior decision itself and what it purports to be and in
effect what it does.
The Board states that there is a twofold purpose in

11
12

deciding Excelsior.

13

union business agents and prospective union members? and two,

14

it is to minimire challenges to voters after an election has

15

been held.

IS
17

13
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

One is to improve communications between

And yet when you analyse it the Board has adopted
what I consider a per se rule here and it says that only in
this manner can unions properly inform the electors of the
issues involved.
Yet the Board in holding to Excelsior has refused to
admit any other means of communication.

In one case, which is

currently pending, petition for certiorari, Teledyne, the
Board refused to permit the mailing of notices or solicitations
by a disinterested third party.
In Teledyne, for example, at first Teledyne Corporation
34

1

1

stated there would be no prohibition of solicitation of union

2

membership in the plant and on working time»

3

to accept this as sufficient forra of communication.

4

The Board refused

Teledyne then offered to send each employee a

5

stamped envelope addressed to the Regional Director of the

6

national Labor Relations Board and telling the Regional Direct©!

7

that he had the right to give his name and address to the unions

8
9

Finally* Teledyne offered* through the use of the
American Arbitration Association* offered at its own expense*

10

Teledyne's expense* to mail to the union any communications

11

that the unions wished.

12

Wone of these were stifficient for the Board.

13

that their argument that this is to favor communications is not

14

exactly truthful.

15

is to encourage union business agents* union officials to

16

visit these employees in their homes and this is the sole

17
18
13

20
21

22
23
24
25

I think,

I think what they are actually trying to do

reason why they are doing it.
Yet* at the same time it has long been established
that if an employer during an election campaign visits the
employee's home to discuss union matters with him he automatically commits unfair labor practice.
I think, this dual standard strikes at the heart of
the Excelsior decision itself.
Q

By the same reasoning are you saying that they

should not permit this rule to be effective so that the union
35

1

officials would be prevented, from seeing the men in their homes?
A

2

No, I am saying this is an extension of the law

3

beyond anything that this Court has ever upheld»

It permits and

4

encourages visitation in the homes by union organizers.

5

Q

You feel that that is contrary to the Act?

S

A

I don’t think it is necessary to the Act or if

1

you are going to permit union organisers into the homes then

3

I think you ought to permit the employers into the homes.

9

think it constitutes a dual standard.
Q

10

11

13

21

Q

Is it your idea that the rule bars the employers

The Excelsior rule permits union men to visit

Q

the homes.

17

19

A

but penults union men to come into the home?

15
IS

Would there be anything that prohibits the

employers from coming?

12

14

I

By a long series of cases, other cases, it has

been held that if an employer does the same thing — this goes
back well before Excelsior — that if the employer visits the
home for the purpose of discussing union activities and union
organization, that it is an automatic, per se, unfair labor
practice.
The second purpose that the Board has stated for the

24
justification of Excelsior is that it minimizes
25

36

and reduces

1

challenges to voters after an election.

a

I think the facts in our Wyman-Gordon case —

3

Q

4
5

Are there cases that say union visitation in the

home is not an unfair labor" practice?
A

I can't cite you a specific case but I know

6

there has never been a case that says a union organiser cannot

7

I think that the fallacy of lessening of challenges
by the use of the Excelsior lists is clearly demonstrated in our

10

brief at page 4 where approximately 1750 voters there were

11

exactly six challenges.

12

1 don't know what percentage figure that, works out to

13

but it certainly indicates that challenges had no real place in

14

the Wyman-Gordon election in 1966.

15

Further, I have analysed the 30th Annual Report of

16

the Labor Board, which is for the fiscal year 1965, and the

17

Annual Report for Fiscal Year ’67, and these are the full year

18

prior to Excelsior and the full year after Excelsior*.

19

In 1965 there were some 7,776 elections.

In its

20

Annual Report they have a table 11 which lists the cases in

21

which challenges have been involved.

22

of challenges only, there are 312 elections out of the 7,000

23

involving challenges.

24

25

They list under the heading

Thus, only 4.01 percent of all the election cases held
the year prior to Excelsior involved challenges.
37

Turning then

1

to the 32nd Annual Report it shows that in fiscal year 1967,

2

8,116 elections were held, and in Table 11 it indicates that

3

under challenges only there were 371 elections in which

4

challenges ware held.
This results in a 4.5 percent of the elections held

3
6

by the Board in fiscal 857 involving challenges.

The improve­

7

ment factor, after the Excelsior requirement was put into

3

effect, is a minus .56 percent.
So the Board by its own records clearly shows that

9
10

the Excelsior rule has no bearing whatsoever on minimising

11

challenges after the election.
Another thing that I would like to point out is that

this per se rule applies to all elections.

f ication in the application of the Excelsior rule with elections
with 2, 3, 4 and 5 people involved in the unit.

I can see no justi-

As a matter practicality if there were only four

or five people they would know where their homes were, wouldn't
they?

Of course they are,

Do they know where all your people live?

2

They can find out,

How do they find out?

4

A

We ''have in the city of Worcestert greater city ofj

5

Worcester area showing that they are employees of Wyman-Gordon.

?

This I suggested as an alternate of means for the union con­

3

tacting .

10

Anybody who wants to find out Wyman-Gordon employees
can go to the Worcester Public Library and get the Worcester
li rectory and they will find every one of our employees names.

12

Q

How often is that directory changed?

13

A

On my recollection it is once every two years.

14

Q

Every two years?

IS

A

Yes.

16

Q

How much of a turnover do you have in your plant?

A

We have a relatively minor turnover.

Q

Some of them have a great turnover don't they?

A

Oh* yes* indeed* but we are the biggest employer

in the area and we have a relatively small turnover.
I would like to turn now to the question of whether
these lists constitute evidence and I believe they do not.

The

purpose of these lists is solely for the Board to take the list
in one hand and then hand it right over to the union.

It is

not used to prove anything* it is not used to disprove anything.
39

1

2
3

I submit that under the ordinary definition of
evidence the Excelsior lists do xiot come within those terms»
In actual practice the Board requests the lists when

4

everything has been done in an election proceeding except the

3

actual voting itself»

6

that is under investigation, there is no question open other

7

than the final results of the election»

3
9

So that there is no evidentiary matter

I think that the Excelsior list does not come within
the common accepted definition of what evidence is.

Corpus juris

10

31(c)(j)(s) evidences a demonstration of a fact that signifies

11

that which demonstrates, makes clear, ascertains the truth of

12

a fact or a point in issue, either on one side or another»

13
14

15

16
17
13

In legal acceptance the term evidence includes all
the means by which any alleged matter of fact, the truth of
which is submitted to investigation is established or disproved.
I don’t see how anybody can hold that taking a list of employees
and turning them over without even looking at it so faras the
Board is concerned constitutes evidence»
Q

What harm do you think it does?

20

A

X think it greatly enhances the union6s right

2?

to approach employees.

22

Q

19

23
24
25

Do you say that they shouldn't have the right to

have the addresses?
A

This is my contention because I think that

violates a right of privacy»

3

S

A

I do, indeed»

I think this is an invasion of the

6

employee's right of privacy and I cover this in my brief»

7

don't think any employer should have the to give a list of

20

21

22

Q

I know that much but

They don't obtain them

Because the company has had a long policy

What provision of the Act do you think would

support that view?

23

A

Support what?

24

G

The view that the company somehow goes contrary

25

to the Act if it has to give out the names of the employees
41

1

to the Board so they can let the Union see them?
A

2

I take that as an assitance to the union and a

3

violation of Section 8(a)(2) and a violation of Section 302

4

in regard to giving a thing of value to the Board that can be

5

t urned over to the unions.
Further, I don't think that if you compare the

6
7

language of Section 11 of the National Labor Relations Act, and

8

the language of the Railway Labor Act giving the Board authority

9

to investigate, you will find that there is any authority for

10

the Labor Board to obtain these lists and turn them over to the

11

union.■

No such authority

Act.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may I make a correc­

tion in one of my answers to a question?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, you may.

I was asked whether there -were other

instances where the Labor Board or other agencies had made
prospective determinations in adjudicatory proceedings and X
said I was unaware of them.

This was a clear slip.

On page 14 of our brief and footnote 11 there are
listed several other instances, both involving the Board and
42

involving other agencies.

This is not a unique situation»
