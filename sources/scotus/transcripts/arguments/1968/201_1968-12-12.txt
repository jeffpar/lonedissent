MR. CRAMER:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court;
This case is before the Court today on petition for

11

writ of certiorari to the Maryland Court of Appeals.

There are

which held that Maryland's constitutional provision requiring all

4

jurors to profess a belief in God or swear a belief in God was

5

in violation of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

6

Petitioner went to the trial court again.

1

He was indicted again for burglary and common lav; hous

3

breaking, and because he sought to exercise his First Amendment

9

rights, he was also indicted for larceny in the second case.

10

In the first case he was sentenced to ten years in

As a result of the second trial, the trial court

his objection on a plea of autrefoits acquit.

That's right,

Q

Are you raising the double jeopardy question only as

The original indictment had a fault,

A

We feel that the larceny conviction was such an unfair

retrial, retrial was such an unfair procedure that this vitiated

both convictions, Your Honor.

12

Q

I gather you are r,ot arguing that the second burglary

conviction has to be set aside on double jeopardy grounds?

14

A

We think it should., too.

15

Q

You say because it was affected by the trial on the

larceny count?
A

And also because of the increased penalty in the second

trial, Your Honor.

Is that a double jeopardy question?

I believe so, Your Honor,

We rely on the decision of

the Fourth Circuit on that point.

There has not been a decision in the State Court?

No, the State of Maryland has decided that Patton v.

I understood you did not raise this question of increa

punishment explicitly in the certiorari petition?

What I referred to specifically was Patton v. North

Carolina, that the second punishment is excessive.

the gambling theory, that is, that the petitionerhad to gamble

Special Court of Appeals, a court enacted to have jurisdiction

that no jeopardy attached or a prosecution based on a faulty

Tf it please the Court, it is the petitioner's position

22

that the double jeopardy cls.use of the Fifth Amendment is a

23

fundamental principle of liberty and justice and is, therefore,

24

applicable to the states either by incorporation in the Fourteenth

25

Amendment or through the due process clause in the sense that
5

1

the procedure employed by the state was violatative of basic

2

fairness.

3

Q

Was your contention overruled in Palko?

4

A

No, sir, because I don't believe that Palko sanctioned

S

this type of procedure, sir.

8

Your Honor, I respectfully submit that the Court also

7

carefully set out that in the Palko Case they were deciding only

8

one issue:

9

Does the State have the right to appeal?
On page 328 of the Court's decision in Palko, I believe:

10

that the Court leaves open the question that has come before the

11

Court today in this case.

12

13
14

Q

In what language did it leave it open?

Do you have it

there before you?
A

Yes, sir.

What the answer would have to be if the

15

state were permitted to try the accused over again, would bring

16

another case against him, we have no occasion to consider.

17

deal with the statute before us and with no other.

The state appealed alleged error

in trial.

22

course, it is the respondent's position that the double jeopardy,

23

clause did not s.pply and they pitched that solely on this Court's

24

decision in Palko v. Connecticut.

The case was reversed and new trial was brought.

In that case it would be limited to Patton.

It is submitted that the

principle for the application of the double jeopardy clause.

most basic type of decision that can be considered on the issue

of double jeopardy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD F. BORGERDING

12

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

13
14

15

MR. BORGERDING:

Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it

please the Court:
The basic question in this case is the petitioner's

16

election to be reindicted by declaring that his original indict­

17

ment was null and void under Schowgurow and his subsequent con­

18

viction constitutes double jeopardy.

19

It is the State's position that it does not constitute

20

double jeopardy in this case.

Now as my brother has indicated,

21

Mr. Benton was indicted in Maryland in 1965 on the three counts,

22

as he had indicated:

23

third count was larceny.

24

by a jury in neighboring Prince Georges County and the State

25

abandoned the second count and he was found not guilty as to the

common law burglary, housebreaking and the
He was convicted of the burglary count

8

1

Maryland Court of Appeals in September of 1965.

*

2

The following month the Court of Appeals of Maryland

•a

handed down the decision in Schowgurow.

ij

So this question of

4

double jeopardy is involved in the procedural setup and what did

5

Schowgurow provide as far as; the Maryland judictional system

6

was concerned?

7

Schowgurow held that the provisions of Article 56 of

8

the Maryland Declarations of Right requiring a belief in God as

9

a qualification for grand jury service or petit jury service was

10

in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States

11

Constitution.

12

And that was predicated on this Court's decision in

13

Torcaso a year or two before in which this Court held that the

14

Maryland requirement that a public official express, a belief in

15

God under Article 37 was in violation.

16

Nov; when the Court of Appeals of Maryland reached this

17

decision, it was confronted with possibly in the neighborhood, it

18

has been estimated, of around 3500 indictments throughout the

19

entire judicial decision of Maryland that had been rndicted by

20

an invalid grand jury, if you please.

21

the retroactivity decision in Schowgurow to the cases that had

22

not become final as of the Schowgurow decision.

23

Therefore, they limited

Now in order to implement and carry out this, and it

24

was a gigantic proposition that was confronting the: judicial

25

system of Maryland at this time, there were several, other cases

Madison,

jury had the right to have the original indictment declared null

C-»

O

6

One was State v.

The question in State v„ Madison was that any accused

and void or his case retried without showing actual prejudice.
Now, Your Honors, the question there was, should a

7

member of the so-called excluded class be entitled to raise this

8

point or was it limited only to the included class, to wit, the

9

persons who did not believe in God?

10

In Madison the Court, I think, went beyond this Court

11

and held that it applied to both the excluded class and the

12

included class.

13

and set aside his indictment, because it was brought back by an

14

invalid constituted grand jury, to wit, a grand jury that was in

15

violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

So that anyone could file a proper proceeding

16

And also you will note in that decision they held that

17

the individual did not have to show prejudice -- this was anther

18

attempt to protect the rights of the individual — that he was

19

prejudiced by this unconstitutional grand jury.

20

Then to cover another point, they had the case of

21

Smith v. State.

22

four days as they implemented this decision.

23

"There could be an intelligent and knowing waiver of the defects

24

in an indictment or conviction by such an improperly constituted

25

grand jury."

These all happened within a period c£ three or

The question here was, did some­

said that “The accused was to be brought into the trial court

"Second, the accused is to be informed of his right

2

to take his conviction and of the fact that the Court would

3

vacate the indictment or conviction if he moved them to do so.

A

"Third, the accused is to be advised that he is subject

*4

5

to reindictment and retrial if he elects not to abide by his

6

present status.
"Fourth, the accused should likewise be advised that

if he be reconvicted, any new sentence to be imposed might be

9

greater or less than the one, or ones, presently against him,

10

within maximum limits.

11

"Five, the accused is to be told that he can waive any

12

defect in the grand or petit jury which indicted or convicted

13

him notwithstanding the unlawful composition of that jury.
"Six, if the accused elects to accept the indictment

14
15

or trial jury as valid, the appeal will proceed in the Court of

16

Appeals in the usual way, on the other grounds of error claimed. ’

17

Mr. Benton was brought into the Court in Prince Georges

18

County.

He was advised of these rights in the presence of his

19

counsel and he exercised his option to declare his original

20

indictment null and void.

21

Q

Where do you find this position stated in the record?

22

A

Your Honor, I would go to the appendix.

23

It would be

in the docket entries.

24

Q

On what page?

25

A

It would be on page 2, Your Honor, where it says,

12

"The

1

defendant challenges the array of the grand jury on June 30,

2

1966 ."

3

Q

I read over on page 4, though, where he says, "It is

4

the position of the defendant that the housebreaking and larceny

5

counts, the second and third respectively of this endictment,

6

should be dismissed, should be a bar in jeopardy as in regards t

7

the present prosecution on those counts and that is our motion."

Q

9

A

That is the original motion, Your Honor, that Mr. Ben­

ton made in the lower court against the larceny count.

Then he

10

has changed it as he proceeded along the appellate road.

n

changed it now and raises the point that he is prejudiced on the

12

larceny count by the fact that he was indicted for larceny after

13

being acquitted of the same.

14

Q

He has

Do you concede this portion of his motion that "The

15

housebreaking and larceny counts, the second and third respect­

16

ively of this indictment, should be dismissed, should be a bar

17

in jeopardy as in regards to the present prosecution on those

18

counts and that is our motion."

19

A

No, sir.

Do you agree?

The State's position is that when Mr. Benton

20

exercised his right to declare his indictment null and void, the

21

indictment ab initio, it was returned by an illegally and uncon­

22

stitutionally organized grandy jury and as such, since he exer­

23

cised that right, an unconstitutional grand jury Ccirmot bring

24

back a valid indictment.

25

fore, he was not placed in jeopardy on his first trial.

The Court had no jurisdiction and, ther

13

!

Q

When is the verdict of not guilty final?

2

A

Well, a verdict of not guilty could be final upon its

3

being given, assuming that no one has any rights to appeal and

4

in Maryland the state does not have the right to appeal.

3
6

Q

A man does not ordinajrily appeeil a verdict of not

guilty, does he?

7

A

You are correct, he does not.

3

Q

When was the verdict of not guilty on the larceny count

3

final in this case?

10

A

11

Your Honor.

12

Q

13
14

I would say it was final on the day it was rendered,

If he takes an appeal from the rest of the judgment,

how does he vitiate that?

Well, to go back to our basic premise that the mere

15

Q

1

You mean in any case if a man is acquitted by a jury

2

and his indictment was not lawfully drawn, that there is no

jeopardy?

4

A

It depends on — when you use the term "unlawfully

5

drawn" and there are some cases that say "defective" and so

6

forth, but I say in the circumstances of this case where the

7

Court held that the grand jury that brought back this indictment

8

was unconstitutionally organized under the Fourteenth Amendment

9

of the Constitution, that grand jury cannot bring a valid indict­

10

ment if that is so.
Mr. Benton made it so by exercising his option.

That is true.

Aren't you here arguing because of all this void indici

ment that jeopardy never attached under that amendment?

18

A

Yes, sir.

19

Q

Even though you went through trial and appeal and

20

everything else, for the purpose of the double jeopardy clause

21

that whole proceeding is one to which double jeopardy never

22

attached?

23

A

That's right.

24

Q

Do I understand correctly that there are no rules of

23

different things that a defendant could do?

15

i

i

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

He could waive the invalidity of that indictment?

3

That is correct.

How can you waive something that is null and void?

of the defendant.

Your Honor, we have to go back to the basis of the

18

Q

The basis of acquittal?

19

A

Well, he was acquitted on an indictment that was

20

invalid.

21

Q

But he was acquitted?

22

A

Yes, sir, he was.

23

Q

By a jury?

24

A

Yes, sir.

.25

Q

So now he is reindicted by a. jury?
16

I

A

That is correct.

2

Q

For the same thing of which he was acquitted?

3

A

That is correct.

4

Q

You don’t see double jeopardy at all?

5

A

The distinction, Your Honor, is in the validity of

6

the grand jury, can an unconstitutionally organized grand jury

7

bring back a valid indictment?
Q

S
9

Have you any cases in Maryland where juries have been

found to be wrongly constituted on other grounds?

A

11

Q

The ULEE Case, on the exclusion of Negroes?

12

A

I thought that was in another state.

13

Q

Would that be another null and void?

14

A

In arriving at their position, our Court of Appeals in

15

In Maryland?

Mot to my knowledge.

the Smith Case quoted the exclusion of Negroes from grand juries

16

Q

Is that null and void?

\1

A

I believe that that would be voidable at the option of

18

the included party, to wit, the Negro in that case.

19

Q

If we have a hypothetical case where a man is convicted

20

of burglary and acquitted of larceny and it is found that one of

21

the jurors was a felon and, therefore, it was reversed, you
’

22

would retry him on burglary and larceny?

23

A

No, sir.

24

Q

What is the difference between that case and this

25

case?
17

\

A

I don't think that that case is the jurisdiction of

2

the Court.

3

still had jurisdiction to try the man in the first instance.

That goes to the illegal sentence, but the Court

4

Q

Did it also have jurisdiction to acquit?

5

A

Yes, sir.

6

Q

Did this Court in this case have jurisdiction to acqui

7

A

This Court, it is our theory and not the Court of

8

Appeals case, once this man voided his indictment, he exercised

9

his option, the Court did not have the jurisdiction in order to

10

convict or acquit.

11

Q

He was never in jeopardy?

A

He was never in jeopardy.

it, what you are really saying is that the petitioner here

waived whatever defect there was in the composition of the grand

jury.

You refer to that as petitioner having agreed that the

pointed to page 2 of the appendix, the item June 30, 1966, that

reads only the defendant challenges the array of the grand jury.

Is there someplace that shows exactly what the defendant did to

which you refer as agreeing that the original indictment was null

Do the words "null and void" appear?

They appear in the Madison Case, which was implementing

the Schowgurow Case.
Q

I am not talking about that.

You said that this peti­

12

Isn't that what you are saying?

A

Yes, sir.

Isn't that what you said?

20

A

Yes, sir, he exercised his option.

Q

I am interested in exactly what were the words used,

Honor, and this has never been challenged, that he exercised his

happened.

Chief Justice Warren asked you that question.

What did he say or what did his counsel say for him?

Is your answer to it confined to the entry that appear:.!
on page 2 of the appendix?
A

Yes, as fax* as the record here before the Court, it

would be limited to that*

Q

There is nothing else in the transcript on file?

9

A

Well, the'transcript on file was only the transcript

10

of the second trial.
Q

When you say the defendant agreed that the first indici:

ment was null and void, that is your inference of law, is it?

13

A

I don’t understand when you say "inference of law."

54

Q

I am trying to find out what happened.

What did the

15

defendant do?

What did he say that leads you to characterize

16

it as a statement by the defendant that the indictment was null

17

and void?

A

This question has never been raised by the petitioner.

steps?

5

A

It is on those six steps you are relying, I suppose,

for your submission that the defendant exercised a right to void

at his option the original indictment?

A

Q

Yes, sir.
My question to you is that there may be a difference -■

the defendant electing to appeal and trying to get the judgment

saying that or agreeing directly or through counsel, or both,

15

that the original indictment, was null and void.

16

As I Listen to your argument, you seem to put a good

17

deal of weight on that specific characterization, to wit, you

18

say the defendant agreed.

19

that is an inference or a conclusion that you urge upon this

20

Court as a result of the events listed in the firs; six items

21

appearing on pages 1 and 2 of the appendix.

But it is now my understanding that

Now do we have it straightened out?

Yes, sir, I would say this was the procedux'e set up by

said, "You set aside that indictment for larceny under Schowgurow

so that I can be retried for larceny, though I was acquitted?"

10

Does that make sense?

11

A

He has to make a choice, Mr. Justice.

12

Q

You call that an intelligent free choice?

13

A

Under all the circumstances it could be.

14

Q

I wonder if this colloquy that begins on page 3 should

not settle the matter in view of the fact that there is no tram*

point as to the larceny count itself, Your Honor, although I

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

19

MR. BORGERDING:

You may proceed.

As far as the retrial on the larceny

20

count itself, I would like to point out to the Court the first

21

count was common lav; burglary in Maryland, breaking and entering

22

in the nighttime with an attempt to commit a felony there.

23

the state evidence was produced to prove the burglary charge,

24

which also proved the larceny charge.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Cramer.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. MICHAEL CRAMER

13
14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. CRAMER:

I would like to clear up one area.

The

16

import of the state's argument is that the petitioner knew pre­

17

cisely what he was doing on the remand proceedings.

13

the material cited to this Court by the respondent refutes his

19

argument rather than supports it.

20

However,

On page 21 and page 22 of the respondent State of Mary­

21

land brief, there is cited six questions that were to be asked

22

of the petitioner on the remand proceedings.

23

note that among the six questions there is no question, "Do you

24

realize that if you. elect to be retried, your previous indictmen-

25

rnay be revived and you may be charged again on all matters, even
-

I

26

The Court will

<1

I

those of which you were previously acquitted?"
There is nothing an this record to support that, not

2
o

«■*!

specifically, not inferentially.

In fact, the State of Maryland

4

asks this Court to believe that on the remand proceedings the

5

petitioner would anticipate that the state would violate the

6

most basic principles of double jeopardy and I think it is wrong

7

to believe that a defendant would anticipate that the state would

a

do wrong.
Furthermore, and lastly, on pages 2 and 3 of the joint

9
10

appendix, we note on page 2 chat the defendant challenges the

11

array of the grand jury on June 30, 1966 .

12

that his trial i*as on August 11, 1966.

On page 3 we note

It is reasonable to infer

S3

from this that the first time he knew that he would be charged

14

again on the case on which he was previously acquitted was more

15

than two months after he made his so-called election.

16
17
18

19

Q

And on the first day of trial his counsel made the

point that he should not be retried for these other offenses?
A

Yes, Your Honor, made the point apparently when he

first knew of it.
One final thing.

20

The Maryland Court of Appeals in its
#

21

remand decision never said anything about acquittals, never said

22

anything about any charges other than the one of which he stood

23

convicted.

24

not say they were remanding anything more.

25

They said we are remanding the conviction.

I thank you very much, Your Honors.
