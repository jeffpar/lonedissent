Mr. Wright.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

[

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

10

Court, the issue here is whether or not a State is excused from

11

the duty otherwise put upon it to give a speedy trial to a per­

12

son indicted on a State charge because that person is, during

13

the pendency of indictment, in a Federal penitentiary on some

14

other charge.

15

The Texas Supreme Court, in a consistent line of cases,

16

has ruled it is not, that although it is bound to give a speedy

17

charge to a person under Texas indictment who is in a Texas

18

prison, that it is not required to have some other sovereign to

19

produce a prisoner in order that it may try him.

20

I propose to spend, unless the Court has questions in

21

the matter, very little time on the merits, in part because I

22

do not think there is an issue as between my friends for the

23

State and myself on the underlying constitutional principle.

24

do not find such an issue drawn in the brief, and I believe

25

that Mr. Moss speaks for the respondent, that it will appear we
3

I

ii

agree on the basic constitutional point.

2

Of course, the agreement of counsel cannot point an

3

authoritative instruction on the Constitution of the United

4

States, but I would think on the substantive point, your deci­

S

sion last term

this case presents, that where someone who is needed for crimi­

9

nal proceeding is in the custody of some other sovereign, that

10

at least the State has the duty to make a reasonable effort to

11

endeavor to get him back from the prison in which he presently

12

languishes. . For reasonable effort is all Page and Barber

13

requires, and that is all we contend for is the role in this

14

case, since I think it is quite clear here that Texas has made

15

no efforts to get this petitioner back from Leavenworth.

spoken through Justice Marshall in the case of

versus Barber is quite decisive that the problem decided,
and Barber is really indistinguishable from the problem

I want to call to the Court's attention a study of

16

17

this matter that is not

referred to in either of the briefs

18

because it has become available only very recently, and that is

19

the 63-page National Survey of Detainers prepared by the

20

National Defender project of National Legal Aid and Defender

21

Association,
That association made copies available to counsel for

22
23

the respondent and myself, and I am sure would be glad to make

24

copies of their very comprehensive survey available to the

25

Court.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

We would like to have them

MR. WRIGHT:

5

I am sure that they can be made avail­

I will see that that happens, Mr. Chief Justice.
There is an issue between my friends and myself.

I

6

am not sure whether it goes to substance or procedure, and it

7

has to do with the effect of the solvency of a person under the

S

State charges.

9

know when the present petitioner became indigent and that since

The State makes the argument that they do not

10

the indictment that they returned against him in 1960 alleged

11

he recently acquired by theft some $42,000; that unless he

12

notified them he was indigent, they would have no reason to know

13

he

14

finance his own way to Houston in order to stand trial.

15

was indigent and therefore no reason to think he could not

In the view the petitioner submits of that, the fact

16

of his indigency is irrelevant; that the obligation to give a

17

speedy trial extends as well to a prisoner or a person under

18

indictment who is rich as it does to one who is without funds.

19

It is a little hard to see what good it v/ould have done the

20

petitioner if ha had had funds.

21

given him a trial within two weeks, any time he shov/ed up in

22

Houston" and if he had the money to pay his way from Leavenworth

23

to Houston and said to himself, "I think I will go to Houston

24
25

The State says, "We would have

jto stand trial," I imagine the Federal prison authorities at
Leavenworth would have taken a dim view of that.
5

-

They would not

1

2

have allowed him to go unless the State had made an effort.
We are told in a memorandum of Solicitor General that

3

ordinarily the policy of the Bureau of Prisons requires a writ

4

of habeus corpus ad prosequendum from the State court, and when

5

that comes, the Bureau then is very cooperative and invariably

6

will make the prisoner available.

7

But it is not the fact that Mr, Smith did or did not

8

have funds that in my submission is significant.

9

fact that he was confined by the Federal authorities and that

10

some request of the State authorities was necessary before the

11

Federal authorities would let him out of the walls of Leaven­

12

worth to go to Houston to stand trial.

13

There are obvious problems in

It is the

this case because the

14

record is not a very thick one,

I am aware of that from the

15

outset of the case,

16

because of the skimpiness of the record that this court either

17

should dismiss the writ as improperly granted or should remand

18

the case to either the Texas Supreme Court or a State trial

19

court for further fact-finding,

And the State suggests in its brief,

20

X submit, however, that the record, skimpy as it. is,

21

presents every fact that is necessary for decision of the com­

22

paratively narrow issue that the case presents, that it would

23

be nice to have a good deal of background.

24

though I am counsel, X do not know on what Federal offense my

25

client was convicted, but*! cannot think it makes any

To this day,

1

difference whether he was in Leavenworth on one crime or not;

2

these are matters of color only, and the basic legal facts are

3

perfectly clear in the record that he was indicted in April of

4

1960 in Harris County for a crime allegedly committed in May of

5

1959; that as of that time, he was a Federal prisoner; that the

S

Sheriff of Harris County wrote to Leavenworth and was advised

7

he would not be released until 1970; that beginning at least in

8

March of 1961, the petitioner made repeated requests to have a

9

speedy trial; that he has not been brought for trial at any

to

time; that there is now a lapse of some eight years and that the

I refer to the case of N. Ray Sommers, for example,

tive action of the Illinois court.

that that letter was a sufficiently definitive act to permit

If

Q

The record does seem to show that your client

!2

was told he could be tried within two weeks, any time he made

13

himself available.

14

A

The record certainly shows that.

15

Q

As 1 read the response in this case from the

16

Solicitor General hare on pages 32 and 33 of your brief, it

17

indicates that if the prisoner himself, as is your client,

18

requests it, the Bureau of Prisons will make him available for

19

a State court trial.
1 am referring to the full paragraph in the middle of

20
21

page 33, and he further says that the petitioner did not request

22

any assistance from the United States Bureau of Prisons in this

23

case.

24
25

Is that all correct?
A

To the best of ray knowledge, it is correct,

Justice Stewart.

8

1

Q

That would seem to indicate he could

have at

2

least tried to make himself available and probably would have

3

succeeded, and then the Texas court said:

4

self available, you will be tried.

If you do make your­

3

A

6

yotir Honor.

7

that occasionally this has happened at the instance of a

8

prisoner, but that a prisoner, not lettered in law, can hardly

9

be expected to know that this procedure was available.

10

I read it somewhat differently, with respect,
It. seems to me what General Griswold said there is

He was doing the obvious things.

He was besieging

11

the Harris County authorities with motions, letters of various

12

kinds as was told in the response; that under the published

13

rules of the Board of Prisons, the prisoner is not advised that

14

''If you will ask us, we will come to your assistance,"

15

the rules speak only that a prisoner will be made available if

16

the State authorities request it.

17

Instead,

I think it would be asking a good deal to say that the

18

peitticner has waived any right he had because he did not pur­

19

sue a remedy that even a reasonably observant person would not

20

know existed,

21

Q

I have one other question.

At the bottom of

22

page 33, the final sentence of the Solicitor General's remarks,

23

is there a. "not" omitted?

24
25

A

There is a "not" omitted there.

You will see the

"not" appears on page 25 of our brief, where we quoted it, but
9

i

here in the appendix it was omitted»

2

cases, counsel do not get to proofread the briefs»

Onfortunately, in indigent

3

Q

So that should say:

4

A

That is what it should say, yes, sir.

S

Q

Do the Federal authorities indicate that if the

"It does not appear»"

0

prisoner himself requests it, they would not only make him

7

available but make him available at their expense?
A

8
9

I do not gather that, but I do not think what is

said here is definitive one way or the other.

As I read this,

10

what Solicitor General Griswold is saying is that if occasional! Y

11

a prisoner asks us, we will write to the prosecutor and say:

12

If you get a writ of hafoeus corpus ad prosequendum from your

13

State court, then we will make this prisoner available so that

!4

ybu may try him.
I do not think it is saying at all that the United

15
16

States, acting simply at the request of the prisoner, would

17

release a prisoner in Harris County and say to the State

18

authorities, "Here he is; go ahead."
Q

19

20

What if such a writ is issued at the instance of

State authorities; what happens then?
A

21

Then the practice is that the

writ x^ould be

22

honored, the State is required to pay expenses of transporting

23

him and guards.
Q

24
25

That is precisely what Texas is not interested

in doing»
- 10

I

Is it also true that the Federal officials first

2

transfer to the nearest Government facility at their own

3

expense?

A

A

It

says in some instances, to mitigate the cost

5

to the State, the Bureau of Prisons has moved an inmate close tc

S

the site of prosecution»

7

Q

Is this Federal procedure formalised in any way?

a

A

There is a statutory procedure for it, Sec­

9

tion 4035, and also there are rules of the Board of Prisons

10

that are issued from time to time in a bulletin that comes out

11

which is made available to State authorities, telling them

12

exactly what the procedure is»

13
14

Q

That contemplates that the State will make the

application, does it not?

15

A

Yes, sir»

16

Thank you, your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE S. MOSS, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

KM

3

MR. MOSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

4

Court, there is absolutely no issue here about the right of

3

this petitioner to a speedy trial.

6

the prosecution in the concerned jurisdiction of Harris County

7

of the State of Texas, have long thought it is absolutely out­

8

rageous to keep things like this hanging over the heads of

9

prisoners who are incarcerated under the jurisdiction of other

10

I, as a representative of

sovereigns, whether it be the State or Federal Government.
Likewise, I fully realize, as your Honors have

11
12.

noticed in some of your recent opinions, that it is a matter of

13

common knowledge that people charged of a crime rarely want a

14

trial at all and, if they must have one, they hardly ever want

15

it to be speedy.

16

of the prosecution and to the advantage of the defendant,

17

petitioner here, because the memories of witnesses dull and

18

that necessarily affects the burden that the prosecution must

19

bear in establishing the guilt.

Delay, as such, operates to the disadvantage

Bearing that in mind, we are here today concerned

20
21

with a remedy.

We are going to try to find out if the failure

22

of this man to have a speedy trial has denied him his consti­

23

tutional rights and, if it has, the next question is:

24

waive it, as we know is being done every day in cases gener­

25

ally.
12

Did he

1

There is an i1lustration in Harris County, Texas,

2

where there are 40 or 50 arrests a day made on the basis of

3

searches and seizures without a warrant, where a person affected:

4

gives his consent to the search and seizure, which, under the

5

Constitution of our country, he is not required to do.

6

waived his rights.

7

He

In this case, did he waive it?

Ewell, by this court some three years ago, said:

8

Whether

9

tion of right is a matter to be determined in the first instance

the delay alone amounts to a constitutional depriva­

10

in the trial court.

11

court is premature and that this court would not pass on it

12

until such time as the sentencing judge in the lower court had

13

heard the facts.

14

Any argument to the contrary in this

In this case the record, let me say, has been pre­

15

pared by stipulation only, and I certainly compliment the

16

gentleman on the great effort he made to get it here, and I

17

agree with him on every turn.

18

with any stipulation he wanted arid not at one time has he dis­

19

agreed with any I asked for, even as late as; today, in order

20

to correct an understatement in the brief.

21

Not one time have I disagreed

The prosecuting authorities of the State of Texas

22

never knew anything about this procedure in the Supreme Court

23

or in the misnamed Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas until

24

after the application for writ of certiorari was filed in this

25

court, the Supreme Court of the United States.
13

1

If you read the records, you will find that the denial

2

of the relief in the Supreme Court of Texas was on June 21, last

3

year -- the petition was filed then and the denial was on the

4

twenty-eighth, and I have a notice in my file here that I have

3

shown counsel that it was not actually mailed down there until

S

E. J. Johnson, a case worker from the penitentiary, sent it on

7

June 22»
Q

8
9

What was the writ; what was the action?

This

was a petition for writ of mandamus?
A

10

Yes, sir, to mandamus the trial judge to dismiss

11

the indictment because he did not have a speedy trial, after

12

seven years, which he, in truth, had not had and which he, in

13

truth, in fact, was entitled to if he had not waived it.

14

Now, so we know that five or six days elapsed between

15

the time this thing was filed in the Supreme Court of Texas and

16

the decision came out and we had no notice of it.

17

in the same year, the petition was filed up here and we did get

!8

notice of it and also at that time of the former proceedings in

19

the Supreme Court.

In August,

Let me say that in the appendix here prepared by

20
21

eminent counsel, the petition itself as contained in the

22

appendix does not show it is verified and it does not show it

23

contains an affidavit of indigency, or poverty, as we call it in

24

Texas.

25

The Texas court is open to indigents the same as to
14

1

anyone e3.se.

2

he must make this oath, and in this particular case, ha did not

3

do so, even though, in my brief for the respondent, X invite

4

attention of the Court to the fact that the copy furnished me

5

in my office did contain this affidavit and did contain the

6

verification of the fact.

7

jurisdiction into the courts of Texas to prosecute him for per­

8

jury by merely giving me a copy; that it has to be filed in the

9

court, which he studiously avoided doing, and that is significant.

There is no price on the remedies down there, but

But that, was not sufficient to put

10

Because he knew if he had done that, that is exactly what we

n

would have done to him, because we know of $42,000 he had in

12

greenbacks and other matters that are not in the record.

13

Even the sentence he is serving at the present time,

14

as counsel says, we do not. know what that is.

We are not con­

15

cerned with what that is, but what are we going to do about it.

16

If this petitioner had been tried in Texas at any

17

time, other than a mistrial only three things could happen:

18

could be acquitted, found guilty and his sentence run concur­

19

rently with the Federal sentence, or he could have been found

20

guilty and the sentence be cumulative with the Federal sentence.

He

21

In the belief, as a member of the bar of this court,

22

I respectfully represent to this court accumulations is rarely

23
24
25

done by the judges in Harris County.

It has to be an extreme

matter before it is done; but in Ewell, this court said they
would take that up later on and see what the judge does; so with
15

4

k

approximately five more years' jurisdiction of the custody of

9

this prisoner vested in the Federal authorities, it could be he

3

would receive a sentence that would be expired by the time the

4

Federal Government gets through with him, and he would be

5

released and

*.»

6

have no more, even if we tried him.

Likewise, the converse is true:

If we wait the other

7

five years and then try him under the laws of Texas, if he

8

received 10 years —- which is the maximum he could receive

9

under the indictment — the trial judge has the discretion to

10

give him credit for the time he already served in some other

11

penitentiary.

12

court, is almost always uniformly done -- then he has not suf­

13

fered any loss of any right, constitutional or otherwise.

14

If he did that

which, I represent to this

On the other hand, if it is cumulative, then the

15

serious question comes up, and as we said in Ewell, that should

16

be decided, whether that had any effect on it, should be

17

decided after the trial judge has had a shot at it.

18

Now, as to when to get him tried, it can be only one

19

of two occasions.

20

United States, and let us see what that is going to entail.

21

Expenses for two marshals, down there and back, exact words

22

being "for the subsistence and shelter of the prisoner and

23

deputy marshals during the entire time of their absence from

24

headquarters."

25

It can be while he is in the custody of the

As Mr. Justice White said, that is what the State of

Texas cannot afford to do.

I think, in all candor —

We just do not have the money, hut

scrapers?

6

7
8

and now there is movement on to get that rescinded, but the

9

checks are still good.

10

Q

I have not, had to discount my scrip.

I suppose if you needed a witness or two from

11

this same State to convict him, you would find the money to

12

bring him there?

13

A

The answer to your question is yes, sir.

14

Q

If you wanted to extradite a rich prisoner from

New York, you pay his expenses even if he had $42,000?

15

A

16

We went to Belgium and got one the other day.

17

We get them when we want them.

18

until we can get him.

19

.

We just don't want this fellow

Now, the day that warden says to us, "Come up here and

20

get him; you can have him," we are going to be there with the

21

money and pistols and handcuffs and we are going to take him

22

back to Texas and do something with him; that is, unless your

23
24
25

Honor says no.

But you see, there, we don't, have to feed his

quards and we don’t have to pay their expenses to and fro.

We

just can send an officer or two officers and they will bring him ,

1

and that is, of course, much cheaper»

2

It is often said there is no price on constitutional

3

rights, but in this case, there is a question of "Who is going

4

to do the paying?"

5

tioner! is it going to be the State of Taxas — or, more prop­

6

erly stated, the County? is it going to be the United States

7

Government; or is it going to be a combination of two or more?

10

What do you have to say about Mr. Wright's argu­

ment that he be entitled to this remedy whether he is a mil­

13

A

I agree with him 100 percent,

14

Q

Then what is the relevancy of the argument you

15

are just making, that he marie no affidavit of indigency?
A

16

The relevancy of the argument is that the

17

sovereign State of Texas still has control of our courts and

18

the amount of time that our judges and so on operate and work

19

and perform their duties.

20

of Texas is that a man able to do so, pay the cost of his pro­

Based on your representation here in open court,

It could well be dismissed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ESQ.
MR. WRIGHT;

I think I should speak immediately to the

3

question "What is the relief?" that has been asked,

4

relief that petitioner asked for in the Texas court was that

5

the indictment against him be dismissed.

A

That is correct.

In Klopper versus North Car,

there is not a word in the opinion about prejudice.
Q

What happened to this man to bring this to

Harris County’s attention?
A

The allegation in the petition for mandamus is

16

that on November 3, I960, petitioner filed v/ith the respondent

17

court his motion for speedy trial which motion was completely

18

ignored by respondent, County Prosecutor, and for a period of

19

six years the petitioner attempted to get a speedy trial.

The response on behalf of Judge Hooey to the petition

.

by letter dated March 17, 1961, the

petitioner requested speedy trial and in reply thereto was

23

notified he would be afforded a trial within two weeks of any

24

date petitioner might specify on which he could be present.

25

Since that time, by various letters and motions, the
28

1

petitioner has asked either for a speedy trial or dismissal of

2

the indictment.

3

No formal action; just letters?

Q

What about Mr. Moss's point, Mr. Wright, that

12

a waiver?

I suppose there could be a waiver of a right of

15

A

I am prepared to concede there can be, yes, sir.

16

Q

As I understood Mr. Moss, he was suggesting that

17

trial is necessary here to, or a hearing is necessary here in

18

which a record can be made to test out whether there has, in

19

fact, been a waiver.

20

A

Perhaps I misunderstood Mr. Moss's argument.

I

21

certainly agree that his argument is, as you said — it was

22

Justice Fortas — but I understood that to be in the context of

23

his argument about indigency, that if Smith had funds and did

24

not make himself available, that then he had waived.

25

Now, if his solvency, or indigency is real -— and I
29

1

agree there could have been a waiver and that would be a fact

2

issue -- I submit as a matter of law that his solvency has

3

nothing to do with it and that if that is correct, then there is

4

no possibility of a finding of waiver on any other ground; when

5

the respondent agrees that my client has repeatedly, for more

6

than six years, been trying to assert his right to a speedi-

7

trial, we can hardly say there has been a known involuntary

3

relinquishment of a right.
Q

9

Would this mean that every Federal prisoner could

have all State charges dropped against him?
A

No.

21

A

That, I think,

is a question, in the first

Instance, of Texas law — what is the proper remedy?

Texas law

regards mandamus from the Supreme Court as the proper way to
assert a right to a speedy trial in a criminal case.

It is a

rather confusing set of affairs, but that is the way it is.
I would think, in response to your question, Mr.
Justice Brennan, that what this court would do if it agreed with
ay brother and myself on the underlying issue, at a minimum you
tfould say you would hold that the Texas Supreme Court is wrong
Ln the proposition of law announced in Cooper and Lawrence; that
the mere fact that a person is in Federal custody discharges any
-

32

1

obligation the State has.

2

This would be the minimum you would do, and then the

*>

*y

State court, free from the compulsion of erroneous view of

4

Federal law, might be free to decide for itself whether it wants

S

to order dismissal or whether it wants to leave prejudice still

6

in.

1

I donst think that is all that this court has the

8

power to do or could do on this record.

I think that che ques­

9

tion of the proper remedy to vindicate the right to a speedy

SO

trial is ultimately a Federal question and therefore one on

11

which this court can speak authoritatively, and I think whether

12

or not a showing of prejudice is required or whether or not

13

untoward delay at some point becomes so bad that simply by

14

itself it requires dismissal is also a question that this court

15

is competent to decide.

16

But any one of those things would still in form be a

17

reversal of what the Supreme Court of Texas did, and it is

18

simply a question of how much guidance this court choses to give

19

Texas for its further proceedings not inconsistent.

20

I must say that the worse possible disposition of the

21

case — I submit this with the utmost respect -- would be to

22

say that in the light of the very commendable statements from

23

Mr. Moss here in open court, that the case could be dismissed

24

without opinion.

25

I have no doubt, in the light of what Mr. Moss told
-

33

1

us, that thereafter persons in this situation in Harris County

2

would be given a speedy trial.

when you can be acquitted, when you could have your witnesses.

his Federal term, my prisoner were to be turned over to Harris

15

County authorities and were successfully to move for dismissal

16

because of a denial of a speedy trial, that he would have been

17

adversely affected by the pendency of this charge, because that

18

is all it is — a charge against him during the time he has

19

been in the Federal penitentiary.

Q

I don't believe the suggestion was that we wait

21

until the end of his Federal imprisonment but right now, forth­

22

with, in the very near future, he be brought before the Texas

23

court where the motion is lodged there to be heard and decided.

And according to Mr. Moss's prediction, he ventured
a guess that the judge would

dismiss the indictment.

Perhaps he would, but if he were to do so with­

out more, I think it would be a surprising action on the part

of the respondent judge when the law in Taxas authoritatively-

declared twice in the last two years that Federal imprisonment

is an adequate excuse for not giving speedy trial.

Q

They might dismiss it on other grounds.

3

A

There might be other grounds,, yes, sir.

Q

It has been suggested there are other grounds.

A

It has been suggested, but I am not cognisant of

what they might be.

Q

12

If we remanded this case to Texas courts without

13

meeting the constitutional issue and they just dismissed the

14

case, this constitutional question wou Id go down the drain,

55

wouldn't it, and we would never have it determined?
A

IS

It would be right back in some other case if it

would not be determined in this case.

But we have it hare and you say it is properly

That would be precisely my submission, Mr. Chief

I would not urge this court to decide a constitutional

Q

I suppose if the Federal Government declined to

give the State the prisoner, that would be a good excuse, would

it not?

In my submission, it would be.

We think the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
