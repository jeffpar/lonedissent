MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

No. 293, Robert Eli

Stanley versus Georgia.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WESLEY R. ASINOF, FSQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

8

MR. ASINOF:

May it please the Court, T would like to

7

request the martial to notify me when 25 minutes is up.

3

would like to save five minutes for rebuttal, if I may.

9
10

Q

I

You will find a white light come up before you.

That will be the five-minute warning.

11

A

12

Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:

Thank you.
This

13

case involves the constitutionality of the Georgia obscenity

14

statute.

15

constitutionality of the statute concerned are twofold.

16

First, we raise the question that the statute

The questions raised by this appeal insofar as the

17

violates the. First Amendment because it punishes the mere

13

possession of obscene material without requiring any further

19

overt act on the part of the possessor or intent to do anything

20

with it.

21

This was a possession, if Your Honor please, where

22

Robert Eli Stanley had possession of three reels of motion

23

picture film in a desk drawer of his upstairs bedroom of his

24

home.

25

showing or attempt to exhibit or show these films

There was no allegation in the indictment of any

3

or pander

f!i

them or show them to minors.

2

The only question involved insofar as the indictment

3.

was concerned was that he possess them knowing them

4

obscene or that he should reasonably have known them to have

5

to be

teen obscene.

8

The second question of our constitutional attack

7

on this statute is the use of the language in the statute and

8

in the indictment to the effect that he reasonably should have

9

known of the obscene nature of the film removes the element

10

of scienter from the definition of the offense and,, thus, permits

11

the State to secure a conviction for possessing these

12

films on a showing less than actual knowledge on his part that

13

they were obscene.

.

14

Q

Do you concede them to be obscene?

IS

A

We do not concede them to be obscene and if

16

we took that position with the trial court then under the

1?

First Amendment insofar as possession itself is concerned

18

that there is no such thing as obscenity.

19

The reason that we took that position and now take

20

that position is this:

21

c-f press clause of the First Amendment to restrict a person

22

or to prohibit a person to possessing anythincr they want

23

insofar as its claim of obscenity is concerned.

24

25

It would be a violation of the freedom

We take the position that where a person merely
possesses an article alleged to be obscene and does not attempt
4

1

to distribute it or to show it

to any other person as was

2

the case in this case and as was the indictment in this case,

3

and as to the holding by the Supreme Court that the mere holdine

4

isn't an offense under the definition of Georgia law, that any

5

evidence in the case on the part of the State or any contention

6

on the part of the State to the effect that the evidence might

7

have circumstantially shown that he was about to have a party

8

and about to show these films to other persons would be

9

completely irrelevant for this Court to consider has no relevant y

10

here because of the fact that he was only charged with the

11

mere possession.
Now, to my knowledge this exact question has never

12

13

been passed upon by this Court.

14

a person can be prohibited by the State from merely possessing

15

obscene material or obscene writings or pictures clearly would

16

seem to me that the mere possession — that anyone would have

17

the right to say "Draw a picture" which might obviously be

18

obscene to some other person and put it in his pocket or put it

19

in

20

himself or take a picture of himself and his wife in a sexual

21

act, that this would be a matter that he could determine as

22

long as he did not attempt to pander this

23

sell it, distribute it or distribute it to minors.

24
25

The question of whether or not

his desk drawer or if he wanted to take a picture of

material, attempt to

Q

Where were these films?

A

These films were in the desk drawer.

\

5

This,

1

of course —

2

Q

Well, you couldn't tell what they were,

3

A

Could not.

4

Q

What did the officers do?

5

A

The officers — I might as well mention this

6

at the outset right here

7

is the officers were on with a Federal search warrant issued

8

by United States Commissioner on a claim that the defendent

9

was violating the Wagering and Tar Act.

10

?!
12

13

the second part of our contention

Since then, of course, this Court has held that the
provisions of that law are constitutionally ——
Q

Excusa me, what I am trying to get to is, did

the officers use the projector to see the films?

J4

A

Yes „

15

Q

Then and there?

10

A

Yes, sir.

They went in on with the search

17

warrant issued by United States Commissioner which did not

18

call for the seizure for any obscene film but called for the

19

seizure of gambling paraphernalia»

20

Wo gambling paraphernalia was seized except some

21

negligible things that I think the State concedes ware not

22

sufficient.

23

But, during their search, they searched through

24

this drawer and found three cans of film, eight-millimeter

25

film, which they testified they could not discern or know from
6
I

1
2
3

their own knowledge that it was what it was»
So they found,in the closet, a projector and they
found a screen and they showed these films and looked at them --

4

Q

Then they set up the screen and -- -

5

A

They set up the screen and they showed them.

6

Q

Is there any conceivable circumstance in which

7

if you saw film that -— could it possibly be connected with

8

gambling paraphernalia?

9

A

I would think not.

I would think not.

I

10

wouldn’t know that there was any connection between them,but

11

what happened, after they showed these films, not having a

12

warrant to seize the films, the evidence shows in the case and

13

in the record that the officer, the State Officer, called the

14

Solicitor General who is the prosecuting officer for that

15

circuit and told him they didn't find gambling paraphernalia

16

but they did find some films and it is in the record that the

17

Solicitor General then stated to him after you view the films

18

if, in your opinion, they are obscene, seize the films and book

19

the case and 1 will set a bond.

20

Q

Well, tell me, suppose, instead of these films,

21

they had found counterfeit bills, couldn't this fellow have

22

been prosecuted for possession of counterfeit bills '

23

A

I think so.

24

Q

Yes? how do you distinguish that?

25

A

I distinguish that, and I concede, that where

7

1

evidence is seized or where contraband is seized, where it is

2

not such as would be subject to a claim of the First Amendment,

3

freedom of press or freedom of speech, that the States do have

4

the right to prohibit the possession.

5

Q

I take it that Harrison would require that that

6

be counterfeit money.

7

A

I think that any case — and we concede that

3

in our brief and make that distinction — that in this particu-

9

lar case, these were films alleged to be obscene from the very

10

start.

11

14

were seised under a warrant issued by United States Commissiones
<
under the Wagering Tax Act, under a contention that the
i
defendent had not registered as a gambler.
I
Q
Was this man a merchant, a distributor or

15

anything like that?

ship.

No, sir.

There was no claim of any distributor-

He was an individual in his own home.

l

The State, of
.

.

18

course, alleged and contended that he had a record for gambling

19

in the past and that the Federal agents and the State agents

20

were going in for that purpose, that they had probably causes

21

one of the contentions in the affidavit being that he had not

22

registered as a gambler and paid his tax, which, of course

23

since then —

I
|

24
25

A

Well, in the prosecution and the actual trial

for possession of these films was there any effort to produce

8

1

proof that possession of these films was for the purpose of

z

sale?

3

A

No, sir.

4

Q

It was just naked possession of the films?

5

A

This is not a -—*

6

Q

There was one other point.

7
8
9

There were biscuits

in the kitchen.
A

This was brought up in the brief to this Court,

that there were biscuits being ready to put in the stove, that

10

there were well-dressed people who came to the house, that

11

this man was a bachelor and his girlfriend had come there

12

and that the officers had turned them away.

13

They said that the table was set for eight people

14

looking like they were fixing to have supper, getting ready to

15

have supper, and, for this reason, they said that apparently

IS

he was going to have a party.

17
18

This is now the contention raised by the State, but
I want to call the Court's attention to this, that --

19

Q

Where was this

20

A

Sir?

21

Q

Where was this

22

A

In Atlanta.

23

Q

Was there

24
25

in Georgia?

in Georgia?

anyclaim that this party was going

to include the showing of these films?
A

That is what they claim.

9

They claim

1

circumstantially -- there is no evidence of that at all.

2

defendent denied knowing anything about --

3
4

Q

The

Well, as I understood you to say, neither

screen nor projector was set up?

5

A

That is right.

G

Q

And the films were in cans in the desk drawer.

7

A

Upstairs in the bedroom of the defendent in a

8

desk drawer.
Q

9
10

he was going to have a party, including showing these films?
A

11
12

Was there any effort at the trial to show that

No, sir, none whatsoever.

No testimony

of

that at all.

13

Q

What do you do with films nowroally?

14

A

Well, I would imagine that you would show them?

15

Q

Do you keep them as a souvenir, or show them?

16

A

Well, I think that an individual could do as

17

he pleases.

18

paramount thing in here, that the State did not contend, by its

19

indictment that he had any intention to show them and this was

20

one of our grounds of demurrer in the trial court in the State

21

court.

But the point is in this case,and this is the

22

Q

And he didn't show them to somebody else.

23

A

Whether there was any intent to do anything

Q

Or even to show them to himself?

24
25

with them.

10

There was

•i

nothing, as I understand yon, there is nothing to indicate —

2

except that he had them in a drawer and in the closet, had

3

a projector and a screen?

4

A

That is right, they were for his own use.

a

Q

Or maybe he wasn't going.to show them at all.

5

A

Maybe he wasn’t going to show them at all.

7
■

He

contended by his --

8

Q

He was going to keep them as a keepsake.

9

A

He could.

In his statement he said that

I

10

have never seen these films before, that a man brought them

11

to my house on Labor Day which was about four or five days

12

before this.
The point was, that the State at no time in its

13
14

indictment charged this.

We demur, on the grounds the vague­

15

ness of the Georgia statute, the Georgia statute did not

IS

specifically make the mere possession an offense,
We asked for interpretation by the State Court and

17
18

got it.

19

sufficient to make the mere possession an offense and that

20

is why we are in this Court, because of the fact that we are

21

reinforced by the State Court decision holding that the mere

22

possession is an offense and we say that isn’t a constitutional

23

interpretation.

24
25

i

The Supreme Court construed the language to be

Q

The nub of this case, as appears on Page 69

of the appendix, doesn't it, right at the top of the page, that

11

j

1

one sentence.

2

A

3

Q

I believe so, yes.
"It is not essential to an indictment charginq

4

one with possession of obscene matter, that it be alleged that

S

such possession was with intent to sell, expose or circulate

6

the set."

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

And that is a clear holding by the highest

9

court of your State that mere possession or,as my brother says,

10

"naked possession"

11

offense.

12

A

is sufficient to constitute a criminal

That is correct.

That is the holding of the

13

Supreme Court,so the question is squarely before this Court,

14

as to whether or not under that interpretation given to it

15

by the Supreme Court of Georgia,whether or not that can be

16

squared with the First Amendment, whether mere possession of

17

material alleged to be obscene, pictures or writings, can be

18

constitutionally made a criminal offense.

19

Q

Does it say that naked possession, pictures

20

of naked persons, cannot be kept in a person’s house without

21

his committing a crime?

22
23

A

Under Georgia law.

Under the interpretation

given by the Supreme Court of Georgia, that is correct.

24

Q

What did this fellow get -- a year?

25

A

Yes, sirj he received a year's punishment.

12

That

1

was fixed by the jury, and it was under the charge of the

2

Court -- of course, under Georgia law, peculiarly, the jury

3

fixes the punishment — the Court charged the mere possession

4

as being — that that is all they had to consider, together

5

xtfifch either that he had knowledge that they were obscene, or

6

that he should reasonably have known of its obscene nature.
Mow, this gets to the scienter question.

7

Whetx^er ©x

8

not a State can withdraw the element of scienter by permitting

9

a conviction to rest upon less evidence than actual knowledge

•50

that it is obscene.

11

Q

Has your client been out on bail?

12

A

Yes, sir, he has been out on bail.

13

The second question involved in Ms case, as I

14

stated, is that this Court has held in Grosso and Marchetti

15

since this case was tried that the Wagering Tax Act is

18

constitutionally unenforceable.
This holding by the Court we say renders the

17

18

search warrant,that was issued in this case, invalid.

19

a motion to suppress in the trial court.

20

We filed

In our motion to

21

Q

When was the search warrant issued?

22

A

The search warrant was issued before Grossoor

23

Marchetti decisions.

24

it was some months before Grosso or Marchetti.

25

motion to suppress the evidence and in our motion the1

It v/as issued in 1967 but it was about —

13

But we filed a

1

allegation was made that the films were seised without a

2

valid search warrant, particularly describing the articles to

3

be seized.

4

That language, we say, is sufficient to now reach

5

back as of that time and say that that was a sufficient attack

6

upon the warrant itself.

7

Q

Do you argue at all that even the warrant was

3

valid and even Marchetti and Grosso weren't retroactive, that,

9

nevertheless, the search was invalid because the warrant

10

described gambling paraphernalia and they,

nevertheless, seized

11

the film which ■— it isn't like just running across contraband

12

that is lying out in plain sight, you have to actually look intc,*

13

the film to see what is in it?

14

A

Not only look into the film ---

15

Q

Do you make that argument?

16

A

Yes, sir.

Not only look at the film but there

17

had been no — this requires on the question of obscenity --

18

it would require at least the finding of a magistrate to

19

determine that these films were obscene.

20

In this particular case the evidence

is clear that

21

this officer called the Solicitor General and asked the

22

Solicitor General what to do and he told him:

23

opinion, they are obscene, seize the films and make a case and

24

I will set the bond."

25

"If, in your

Now, we say that this would require, before a film

14

1

or picture or photograph or anything else can be considered

2

to be obscene,, there must be some judicial finding, some

3

notice, some knowledge that these films have been declared

4

to be obscene,, at least that much.
We say that, for that reason, that

5

even though

6

officers would be authorized, under search warrant, to seize

7

contrabands not named in the article, they would not be authorised

S

to seize films alleged to be obscene.
If the Solicitor General, himself, had no judicial

9
10

powers under the laws of Georgia, had no right to, himself,

11

have seized the films, but in this case he delegated some

12

sort of judicial power to the officer making the finding and

13

told him:

14
15

"If, in your opinion, they are obscene" -—
Q

I take it you are relying on Marcus, are you?

You are relying on Marcus?

16

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

Marcus involves, as I recall it, didn't it,

18

a warehouse full of books of which there were six or seven

19

that the police had purchased and there,on the basis of police

20

examination of the books, they issued the warrant.

21

A

That was under the Missouri statute.

22

Q

We said that they had to have a determination

23
24
25

advance, but isn't this a little
just a single item.

different?

Here you hai^e

Just how would you get the film to have

a determination of obscenity before a search warrant is issued?

7 £

i

i

How would you get it?

2

A

3
4
3

8

If the Solicitor General had instructed the

officer, submit your facts to a magistrate and if he -Q

What facts?

He would have to take the films,

wouldn't he?
A

No, he could, by affidavit, submit to a

7

magistrate who was authorized to issue a warrant, he could

3

submit what these films

9
10

11

Q

revealed to him.

According to another argument, he wasn’t even

entitled to look at them.
A

That is right.

He was not even

entitled to

12

look at them, which, of course, is, again, the question.

13

say under either one of those theories, the seizure of the

14

films was illegal.

15

Q

We

Well, it wouldn't be obscene unless it lacked

36

some social and redeeming value, as I understand it, and you

17

couldn't tell that unless you saw it.

18

A

Well, of course, Your Honor, that is true.

But,

19

I think that is something that has been the subject of discussion

20

for many, many years, as to whether or not an item does have

21

redeeming social value or whether or not it could be classified

22

as obscene.

23

Q

Were these movies shown at the trial?

24

A

Yes, sir? the movies were shown at the trial.

25

Q

Did the jury see them?

16

1

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

Are they here?

3

A

Yes, sirj 1 think this Court has them and I

4

would say this, that,of course, I think and I would concede

5

to this Court that the pictures, the films, insofar as films

6

are concerned, I think

7

disgusting makes them

obscene»

I don't know that they would appeal.

8
9

disgusting, but I don't know that

appeal to my prurient interests.

They wouldn't

I don't know whose prurient

10

interests they would appeal to because I think that they are

11

sickening.

12

sickening than to show a man being tortured to death and havinc?

13

his guts torn out of him.

But I don’t think that they would be any more

That wouldn't be obscene.

It is really hard to say what obscenity is but getting

14
15

right to the point in this case, we say, that if they are

16

the vilest, the filthiest pictures that could ever be seen,

17

that a person has the right to possess them as long as he has

18

not — and this is what this Court held last year in Redrup

19

and the other cases along with Redrup — that as long as there

20

is no pandering, as long as there is no exhibition to minors,

21

and as long as there is no intrusion upon the privacy of other

22

persons who are unwilling to see them, then, of course, we

23

have nothing, and this is all we have in this case, unless you

24

want to accept the State’s theory that because there were some

25

biscuits being prepared to put into the stove, because of the

\

S

17

1

fact that the table was set for eight where they were going to

2

have dinner and against the statement of the defendent in the

3

trial of the case, nothing to refute that, that a man had

4

brought these films to him several days before and told him:

5

"I have some films that 1 would like you to see."

6

Now, we say this, if the Court please, that wherever

7

we find that a question of obscenity

Q

or not we know that something is obscene, if

9

10

is concerned or whether
A

tells

B:

"I

these pictures are

obscene."
Does that say that

11

B

cannot determine or ascertain

12

for himself whether they are obscene to him or does that mean

13

that he would have the right to himself inspect those films

14

and say:

15

whether"--

"X have a right under the First Amendment to determino

Q

Well, you don't have that case here.

Well, that

19

Q

All you have here, as I understand it, assuming

16
17

Why argue

that case?
Ls what it would actually --

20

any obscenity of these films, a question of whether the

21

22

just the possession of itself constitutionally can be made a

23

crime under the First Amendment; isn't that what it is?

24
25

A

That is right.

And that is why I say, if Your

Honor please, that because of that a man has the right to
18

i

determine for himself if it offends him? if, to him,it is

2

obscene, because it would violate the First Amendment to

3

say that if a man handed me some film -Q

S

Incidentally, is there anything in this record

to snow that he had any knowledge as to what these films were?
A

0

None whatsoever, except the fact that they

7

said —- an expert testified that the films had been scratched,

8

one of them was wound backwards, to show that someone had

9

seen them at some time in the past, but nothing to show that

10

he had seen them or he had viewed them.

11

There is nothing to refute or

12

rebutt

his statement

that he had never seen them before.

13

Q

Well, were they in his bureau drawer?

14

A

They were in his desk drawer of his bedroom

15

upstairs.

And there was no setup, nothing set up, no screen

16

set up to

show or view these films.

The difference between this and

I think that would be analogous.

So, I would like to reserve what time I have left,

I know the white light hasn't come on, I would like to reserve,

if I may, the time that is left for rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

19

Mr. Sparks.

1

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J„ ROBERT SPARKS, ESO.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

3

MR. SPARKS:

May it please the Court:

I am the

4

trial counsel who prosecuted this case in the court below,

5

Superior Court of Fulton County so the Court has the original

6

trial counsel, Mr. Asinof was the defense counsel.
Now, 1 want to point out several things to the Court,

7

8

which I think Mr. Asinof neglected to point out because he

9

was so

10

wrapped up in his own argument.
One is this:

On the question of whether or not this

11

Georgia statute contains the element of scienter, I want to

12

point out to the Court that the Supreme Court of Georgia

13

ruled on that in

14

this very case.

The Court said, I am just reading in part, just a

15

line, "It is contended that being contended that the require­

16

ment of reasonable knowledge would withdraw the element of

17

scienter from the definition of the offense and would render

18

a person guilty without actual

19

nature of the

20

knowledge of the obscene

matter."

This contention is without merit.

Now, as we have

21

pointed out in our brief the Court has consistently held that

22

where a State statute is interpreted by the highest court of

23

its State, that this Court is bound by the construction placed

24

on it by that court.

25

That happened in the Mishkin case, another obscenity
20

1

case, which the Court, of course, is familiar with, and also

2

in the last Ginsberg case.

3

the New York statute, which you find knowledge is this, "the

4

word

5

defined "knowingly" as "Having general knowledge of or reason

0

to know,"

1

"or reasonably should know, or a belief or ground for belief

8

which warrants further inspection or inquiry."

9

W
'm

Now, in the last Ginsberg case,

knowingly possess obscene matter".

The New York statute

the exact same words that are in the Georgia statute,

In other words, in the Ginsberg case, and that is
a G-i-n-s-b-e-r-g case, there being two Ginsberg cases in the
obscenity field, this

Court accepted the construction placed

12

on the scienter feature of the New York statute and said, as

13

we are bound to do.

14

Now, the Georgia Supreme Court said, in response to

15

Mr. Asinof's contention that the language of the Georgia

16

statute, "If such person has knowledge or reasonably should

\7

know of the obscene nature of the matter,"does not remove

18

scienter from the offense, but is merely a statutory expression

19

of the rule of evidence which has been in Georgia courts for

20

many years.

21

That is the only way you can prove intent

or know­

22

ledge of a person as to anything, as to whether goods are

23

stolen, or any element involving intent or knowledge, unless

24

he confesses by the circumstances as to whether a reasonable

25

man in the same position would know or would have knowledge

21

1

2

of the obscene nature.
So, we submit, respectfully, that by a long series

3

of this Court's own decisions, that you cannot go beyond or

4

reverse the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court on this

5

question of scienter because that is a State Court interpreting

6

its own statute.

7

I have cited a number of cases where this Court has

a

said that "We are bound by such expresstion".

9

also said it in the Mishkin case, you said it in the Kingsley

30

International Pictures Corporation case, in about eight cases,

11

Aero Transit, all of which are listed in our brief.

12

This Court

So that moves us onto the second facet of the

13

attack on the constitutionality of the statute.

14

most earnestly,to the Court that scienter is an element of

15

this offense as interpreted by the Georgia Court, by the judges

16

of the Supreme Court, and that this Court cannot, unless you

17

reverse your prior rulings, which are set out in our brief and

18

which I have cited to you, unless you reverse that long line

19

of cases, I don't believe the Court could, in keeping with

20

its precedence, it said, "We think the Georgia Court was wrong

21

when they said that this statute does not contain the element

22

of scienter."

23
24
25

Q

I submit,

What was the State's evidence on scienter — the

State's evidence to prove scienter?
A

It was circumstantial, Your Honor, but we think
22

1

2

it was sufficient.
These officers went in with a Federal Search Warrant

3

to seise wagering paraphernalia.

5

This man was

alleged to have

Q

What connection would that have?

7

A

That wouldn’t have^any connection with this

a
9

case, but I point out the probable cause that we had.
Q

No, I am interested in how you brought evidence

10

and what evidence there was on which the jury could find that

11

he knew the contents of these motion pictures?

12

A

One of the cans bears the label "Young Blood"

13

on it, which is certainly a suggestive title.

I would still like to know, if you don't mind,

18

what the evidence was that brought home to him the knowledge of

19

the contents of those movies?

20

A

Well, the evidence showed, Your Honor, that in

21

the upstairs living room there was a projector set up and a

22

bunch of innocuous films, slides, travel logs, things like that.

23

These films were not found with the other films,

24

the innocuous, though innocent type films, but they were found

25

in a desk drawer underneath some papers in his private bedroom.

23

The officers ran them, threw them against the wall,

2

and then went downstairs and

for what?

I think that they wanted to look at the films

He could do that just like the old story by

As soon as you

saw the first frame you thought you

were still looking for records?

No, sir, but there were three cans ■—-

They ran through all three, 1 take it.

They didn't show all three of them.

the record shows that they only showed a few feet of the second

Q

Nov/, you were going to tell us that he

went

2

downstairs and, I gathered, you were going to tell us that he

3

met the defendent — the officer did?

4

A

He went downstairs and met the defendent and

5

told the defendent that "I am arresting you for those obscene

Q

films upstairs."

7

don’t claim that you can't use his right to remain silent

8

against him.

9
10

The defendent said nothing.

Of course, 1

That is a constitutional right.

But it would still seem more logical to say "What
films" if he didn't know he had any obscene films.

11

Q

But so far you have got that he said nothing.

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

Now, what else have you got?

The officer

14

said "I am going to arrest you for those obscene films".

15

defendent said nothing.

20

A

He said, "Let me call Mr. Asinof",

and he

Q

Now, does the fact that he called his lawyer

indicate that he knew what those films were?
A

No, sir, but there is his own statement 7- he

made a statement on the trial.

22

ment law where a defendent can either be sworn or make an

23

unsworn statement.

25

did

call Mr. Asinof.

21

24

The

This is

Georgia has the unsworn state­

what he said, and while it is not in

admission, it still is significant, I think; it is very brief.

He said:

"I am a bachelor.

I live

by myself and

2

I have a girlfriend.

invited several couples out.

of mine came by and said,

He handed it to me.

It was three rolls of film.

Then he goes on to say he never looked at it.

However,

there were two people in the backyard when the officers made

the execution of the search warrant, two men; three women came

11

over later that evening, well-dressed women.

a party.

15

a party and in the connection, the context of his statement

16

telling about the party first and a friend by and saying,

17

want you to see them", I think it is a reasonable deduction

18

that the jury could have drawn that the films were to be shown

19

at the party.

20

In fact, he told the jury that he was going to have

Q

"I

Well, is there anything in what you have told

21

us that support an inference that he had looked at the films

22

and knew what they were?

23

A

Only one of the Federal agents was a former

24

professional photographer, Your Honor, and he testified that

25

the films were badly scratched, that they were dirty, that one

26

1

of the films had been wound backwards which caused the figures

2

to project upside down on the wall when they showed it and he

3

said that they had, obviously, been used before, been shown

4

before, many times.

Q

Many times, did you say?

I am not certain whether he used the word "many"

7

or not,

I know that he said that they had,obviously,been shown

I could find that for you.
