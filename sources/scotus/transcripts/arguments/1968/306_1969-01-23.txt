ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. ANDERSON, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ANDERSON;

7
3

Thank you, Your Honor.

May it please

the Court.
This is an anti-trust suit filed by me in the

9
10

Federal District for the western district of Kentucky in 1962

11

charging the respondents, United States Steel Corporation and

12

its wholly owned subsidiary, U. S. Steel Homes Credit Corpora­

13

tion, with conspiring to violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Shermai

14

Act.

15

The background of the case is that in December of

16

1959 Mr. A. B. Fortner of Louisville, Kentucky had an interest

17

in a number of coi*porations and he had been involved in the

18

real estate business, the real estate development business,

19

since approximately 1939.

29

In the period immediately prior to this December

21

1959 time, Mr. Fortner and one of his business associates and

22

another corporation had commenced development of a subdivision

23

in the Louisville, Kentucky and Jefferson County area.

24
25

They had, in fact, prior to December of 1959, built
250 conventional homes in this subdivision which was called
2

1
2

Golden Meadows Subdivision.
In December of 1959 Mr. Fortner was approached by

3

representatives of the United States Steal Corporation and

4

their Homes Division which manufactures prefabricated homes.

5

These are house packages that they deliver on a tractor-trailer

6

van and the builder has people there to erect the homes.

7

Now, when these people approached Mr. Fortner, they

0

approached him on the premise that there were substantial

9

financing benefits to be derived from this second conspirator,

10

whom we charge here in this case, what I call the Credit

n

Corporation.

\z

This was a financing subsidiary and its purpose was,

13

at the beginning, to aid the dealer-builders of the Homes

14

Division of 0. S. Steel.

15

As we indicate in our brief, this purpose got

16

extended in 1958 just before they started talking to Mr.

17

Fortner and they decided that they were going to use the

18

financing,as their own people have described it, as a tool

19

to obtain sales of these prefabricated homes.

20

So, Mr. Fortner had numerous discussions with

21

these people and financing offers, I believe, in construing

22

the evidence, of course, where we are basically talking about

23

whether a summary judgment should have been given against us,

24

that the evidence should have been construed most favorably

25

to our side and not the other side, and I think that the
3

1

inference most reasonably to be drawn from this record is

2

that these financing offers, according to Mr» Fortner's affi­

3

davit, kept getting better and batter tp the point that they

A

offered Mr. Fortner 100 percent money to buy the land and

&

develop the land that had not been developed that was left in

6

the remainder of this subdivision.
They also were going to provide the construction

7

money, all at a six percent interest in one-half points.

G

Now, there are substantial differences between this

9

financing of 100 percent at six percent and one-half point

10

and other financing available, I believe, generally, throughout

11

the eastern portion of the United States and certainly in the

12

lower Kentucky area during thi3 time to dealer-builders or to

13

builders.

14

The conventional development and land purchase loan

15

as their own documents show was a 60 percent loan, not 100

16

percent.

17

The other manufacturers, who were supposedly in this

financing business also, were offering six percent interest,

18

but 10 points.

19

So that when this offer came to Mr. Fortner, this

20

was an exceedingly attractive proposition to him.

21

Q

22

I am essentially ignorant in this general field

of financing, so that

23

I don't quite understand what six

percent interest, but 10 points is.

24

A

25

The six percent interest would be six percent

per year throughout the term of the loan.

A

Right, and has —-

6

Q

And what happens to that difference of $ 00,000?

7

A

Well, it is, in effect, if the Court please,

8
19

a form of usery, which is condoned, unfortunately, by the
Courts.

20

Q

The borrower never gets that?

25

A

No, sir.

22

and

That is why one"half of a percent

it.

As Mr. Flinn points out in his own brief, that it

11

is taken off the top.

12

Q

Okay.

13

A

So that thiswas substantially an attractive

14

proposition to this man who is in business and he has a

15

corporation in existence which is called Fortner Enterprises,

16

Inc.

17

It, as other businessmen do, has corporations available from

18

time to time.

19

That corporation had been in existence for some time.

The land that was to be the subject matter of this

20

arrangement was available in another corporation.

21

when it got to the point of this transaction being consummated

22

this corporation then had sold to it by the other corporation

23

the land on which they were going to build these homes.

24
25

So that

Now, these people started out talking to Mr. Fortner
about homes, and the whole idea of this thing was that you
6

have got our homes if you are going to borrow this money on
these favorable terms.
So, they prepared three sets of documents, a loan
agreement, a mortgage and a set of notes.

The loan agreement

is the key document here because that loan agreement specifi­
cally provides that on each lot in the subdivision which is
the subject matter of these loans that there will be erected
a prefabricated house manufactured by the United States Steel
and its Homes Division.
Now, this loan agreement, itself, was an agreement
between the Credit Corporation and Fortner Enterprises, Inc.
United States Steel is not a party to this agreement.

They

were a third party, obviously, beneficiary of the agreement.
The loan agreement goes on to provide that,if the
borrower, Mr. Fortner and his corporation, doesn't do various
things, like pay on the notes and so forth, including,, if the
borrower shall otherwise fail to comply with the tgrms of
this agreement, or with the terms and provisions of“the notes
or mortgage, then in any such event,at the option of the lender;,
all obligation on its part to make further advances on account
of the loan shall cease and the lender may enter into posses­
sion of the premises and perform any and all work and labor
necessary to complete said improvements and direct said dwelling
houses.
The said dwelling houses that they are referring to

7

1

are the U. S. Steel Homes prefabricated houses.

2

So, they entered into this transaction.

3

has stated in his affidavit, which is in this record, that

4

he would not have purchased these homes but for the unique

5

character — the attractive, to him as a consumer and business-

6

man —~ character of the loans that were Oi.fered.

7

He started his project.

Mr. Fcrtner

The record shows qui„e

8

clearly that they spent large sums of money on advertising,

9

that they did all the things necessary to get the project

10

going in a proper manner, that there were de3ays

11

that there were problems.

in deliveries,

12

A second loan was made and at the time that the

13

second loan was consummated to cover some additional lots

14

in the subdivision that became available, there had been

15

closings according the the record.

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Then, after this loan was consummated, which did get
some additional capital into the corporation, things really
began to happen.

This is where we get the damage to Fortner

Enterprises because the houses, as they were occupied, began
i

to reveal substantial defects.
They couldn91 get along and the reputation of the
subdivision started going bad.

Mr. Fortner’s salesmen started

not wanting to come out and sell the houses because of the
way the walls and the tops that would swell up.

So, Mr.

Fortner called these people and said, "Look, I will meet
8

;

1

every terra of this loan agreement, our people will pay off

2

this loan agreement, the money that you loaned us, but please

3

relieve us of the restrictive provision in the contract.

4

us build conventional homes."

5

This was refused.

Let

This was in December of 1961 or
I

6

January of 1962.

7

wrote the Homes Division a letter saying we just can’t live

8

with this thing.

9

they again, I guess you would say, formally asked the Credit

‘10

Corporation representatives there, "Let us out of this so we

11

can pay you off.

12

off in accordance with the terms of this agreement

13

relieve us of this tie-in arrangement in this loan agreement.”

14

Matters kept getting worse.

So, Mr. Hamilton

So they had a meeting, and at the meeting

We are ready, willing and able to pay you
if you will

They were again refused and told that they were

15

going to insist that they fulfill every term of the loan

16

agreement.

17

anti-trust suit was filed.

18

It was impossible to build these homes and this

This suit was filed charging, of course, violation

19

of Section 1, on the basis of the conspiracy to create the

20

tie-in, the tie-in, itself, and on the basis of the conspiracy i

21

tc mohopolisse. between these two corporations under Section 2 of
i

22
23

the Sherman Act.
v

The evidence is that,in 1960, 68 percent of all the

24

sales of the Homes Division involved loan agreements with

25

this tpye of tie“in provision in it.

9

In 1961 it was 70 percent.

3

In 1962 it was 75 percent.

2

Of the 43 people whose names are listed in the record to whom

3

loans were made in excess of

4

29 of those fell under, what they call, their special financing

5

program, which is this program where they go beyond conventional

6

means and use whatever really means are necessary to capture

7

a purchaser for these products, mainly this junk that they

Q

call prefabricated houses.
Q

to monopolize, to monopolize what, housing and the building of

32

A

Prefabricated house market, yes, sir.

This is

33

not a charge of monopolization, but a charge of conspiracy to

34

monopolize, which I view in terms of their own record showing

35

that the purpose of this program was to obtain for them a larger

16

share of the market in the prefabricated home field.

37

Q

Well, now, that is something short of conspiracy

38

to monopolize.

20

a larger share of the business.

Every businessman is always, on his own or in

Yes, sir, and there are proper ways to do it and

improper ways to do it.
Q

What is the theory of the conspiracy to monopoliz 0?

My question is to monopolize what — new housing building in
Louisville, in the Louisville market area or -—
10

A

1

Well, I regarded it, Your Honor, as their whole

2

market area, because the evidence is that this was the tool tha1

3

they were using in their whole market area to obtain sales

4

of this product.
My point, in this summary judgment procedure, is that

5

6

I had enough evidence in the record to, at least, create a

7

question of fact for trial.

3

is all about.

9

for summary judgment filed 11 days before trial after 1 had

This is what really this case

I am here being kicked out of Court on a motion ■

10

had considerable discovery over the years with my client, Mr.

11

Fortner’s deposition, for example, had never been taken.
So, that when I, in the process of getting ready for

12

13

trial, am confronted 11 days before trial wi£h this motion

14

for summary

judgment, prepared

affidavits

of Mr. Fortner and

15

of Mr. Horn, which affidavits I felt clearly established,

16

at least,questions of fact to be decided by a jury.
So, I am knocked out on my ear.

17
18

am her1?.

I think I am entitled to a trial.

That is

why I

My position all

19

along in this matter and partly as a tactical proposition

20

has been that the evidence uncontradicted evidence in the

21

22
23
24
25

record fulfills the elements of an illegal tie-in.agreement,
that we have

the necessary economic force present undery

existing case law on tie-ins to establish the requisite econo­
mic power of the respondents over the tie-in element.
We have the necessary, not insubstantial, amount of
11

1

interstate commerce in the tie-in element, ie., the prefabricated

2

houses, and we have admitted, it has never been denied that the
time itself exists.

4

Q

P

A

Yes, sir.

Q

They are not monopoly?

7

A

That is correct, sir.

Obviously, I feel, that the best thrust of my case

is the Section 1 violation.
Q

Well, under the Section 1 violation, what

additional evidence would you have that is not in this record

already on your tie-in point?

3

A

Well, I am sure that Mr. Flinn, in his brief,

4

has apparently completely changed the respondents' approach

5

to this matter and is now, I feel, more directly meeting the

8

issues that are involved.

I had other witnesses who

would testify on this element and ---

What element?

3

A

The element,. Your Honor, that financing on the

4

terms that were offered to Fortner Enterprises was not available

at least in our Louisville, Kentucky area from any other

source„

7

Q

You say they forced you to buy a tie-in.

8

A

Yes, sir.

SO

Q

Forced you to buy the prefabricated houses in

11

9

They forced us to buy the prefabricated

houses.

12

A

In order to get the loan, yes, sir.

S3

Q

And that is the argument you have?

14

A

Yes, sir.

In order to get the loan which was

15

of a particularly appealing nature to this businessman which

IS

was unique in its properties in that it was not the conventions.'

17

type loan, shall we say.
Q

18

I wonder if the

issue before us can be stated

19

this way:

20

available for funds by way of loan in the area.

21

other sources available from which you could obtain loans.

22

I suppose incontestably there are other sources
There were

According to the opinion of the court below there

23

were a great many such sources, but your point is that it was

24

only from the defendant here, the U. S. Steel's lending

25

ration or financial corporation or whatever it is, that
13

corpo­

!

Fortner Enterprises

could obtain loans on terms and conditions

that were economically possible for the company.
A

Yesr sir.

Q

So that the narrow issue we have is whether the

requirement in our Northern Pacific,and other tie-in cases of
an appreciable effect on the market, whether the tie-in has an
appreciable effect on the market or ties up the requisite
portion of the market is satisfied by that kind of a showing,
satisfied so clearly and completely as to justify a summary
judgment against you.
Is that about the issue before us?
A

Well, everything is correct, Your Honor, except

the question of whether — I think it is the converse really.
The summary judgment was against me, not for me.
Q

I know that, yes.

I tried to say that, as to

justify the entry of summary judgment, we are sitting as an
appellate court and the question is whether the lower court
did or did not err in entering a summary judgment acrainst you
or the basis of a record which you say was not complete, but
a record which, nevertheless, established that the exc-usion
or the pre-emption, if it occurred here, by reason of the tie-in,
was not a pre-emption of the total financial market, but only
a pre-emption of that portion of the financial market which
was available to you for the purpose of obtaining loans on
I
these peculiarly advantageous conditions.
i

14

A

Well

Q

I am

trying not to state this invidiously so

far as either side is concerned, but it seems to me that that
| is

the issue.
A

I cim not trying to evade answering you.

To

me the case is a situation where at least the question exists,
was there sufficient evidence on these elements of the tie-in
arrangement either to create an issue of fact for a jury
try or even go beyond that and my own feeling is that

to

the

evidence is --Q

What I ask you is, is the dispositive issue

of fact that is before us a question whether — well, it is
dispositive of law before us, depends upon whether we believe
Ui&t you can establish your case by showing merely this
qualified partial pre-emption of the market that 1 have
described.
That is to say, pre-emption of the market of funds,
of available funds, available to you under these peculiarly
favorable terms.
A

Well, I didn't — to me I am accustomed in

these tie-in cases to thinking of pre-emption of the market
in terms of the tied

product and not of the tie-in element.

To me International Salt, Northern Pacific, Loew's,
and the recent Perma Life Muffler case all teach that some
economic power must exist over the

IS

tying

element to enable

it to have the force of a lever for the purpose of creating
the tied situation.
My point is that in this case the evidence on the
unique character of these loans on these terms satisfies that
basic requirement.
Q

You could have gone elsewhere and obtained

a loan on — but not on such favorable conditions; is that
right?
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

Q

You could have gone elsewhere and obtained

prefabricated houses or could have built conventional houses;
is that correct?
A

Before we signed the loan

Q

Yes.

agreement, yes,

sir.

It is a question of whether the putting together of
these constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade under
Section 1.
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Or satisfied, perhaps, the stricter standards

of our tie-in cases.
A

That

is correct,

Q

The issue then is

sir.
whether therewas here the

kind of market pre-emption or foreclosure of loan funds availed. 4
on these peculiarly advantageous terms, whether that kind of
pre-emption or foreclosure constitutes a violation of Section 1
16

iI

when ifc was coupled with the tie-in arrangement for the pre­

2

fabricated houses.
A

3

Am I getting closer to the target now?

I really think that Your Honor is addressing

4

this in terms of the money being

Q

And this is, therefore, exactly the opposite

12

from a case that

I seem to remember, maybe it was a consent

decree, where a person when he bought a General Motors Car,

14

and I am not even sure it was General

15

the General Motors Finance Corporation to get the money.

Motors, had to go to

16

This is exactly the opposite.

17

A

This is the opposite

of that case in that that

18

is the U. S. v General Motors and I believe we cited that in

19

our brief.

In that case, the tying or the financing was the

Q

The tied element.

They wanted to make a profit

out of the loan.
A

That is correct, sir.

Q

But the court below held that funds were avail­

able to you elsewhere, except that they were not available
17

\

on these terms and conditions.

2

A

Yes, sir,

oO

Q

So the question is whether the foreclosure of

4

the availability of funds on these specially favorable terms

5

and conditions satisfies the requirements of our tie-in cases.

6

A

I cannot agree with Your Honor's language.

If

7

you were talking about the prefabricated houses, which is the

e

tying element, one of the questions is, is there not a substan­

9

tial amount of interstate commerce involved as

1C
11

far as the tied

element is concerned, which are the houses.
Here we have, I think the record shows clearly, a

12

substantial amount of money to meet that test.

13

financing is concerned, it seems to me that the question is

14

not whether other people were foreclosed as far as that element

15

is concerned, but whether by

16

conditions, this could be used in the marketplace as a lever

17

to require the tie-in, in other words, the purchase of the pre­

13

fabricated houses.

19

As far as the

cause of the peculiar terms and

To me, this case is very parallel to the Perma Life

20

Mufflers case where this Court very recently held that there

21

was a case to try on facts, to me, which are not as appealing

22

as ours, because there those people made all sorts of money

23

out of their franchises.

24
25

They accepted,because they were advantageous to them
in the business community, these franchises. Pereas, in our
18

case, the tremendous loss has occurred and no opportunity to be
relieved of the restrictive agreement.
So, I feel that our case actually is a stronger case
than the Perirta Life Mufflers case, in which this Court said,
there is evidence of a conspiracy to restrain trade here under

back for trial.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP MacDONALD FLINN, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. FLINN;

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Subject to the wishes of the Court, I plan to

5

6

devote the bulk of my argument today to what we conceive to

7

be the central legal issue in this case.
That issue turns upon the first of the two elements

3
9

requisite the proof of a Sherman Act time violation.

10

Specifically, the question raised is this:

If the

11

Court,drawing every reasonable inference in favor of the

12

plaintiff, concludes that the evidence shows that defendants’

S3

financing of the plaintiffs was on more favorable terms than

were available from any other source, does that fact standing
i
15 ! by itself establish the requisite sufficient economic power
II
over the tying element to appreciably restrain trade in the
16
14

17

tied product, here, prefabricated homes.
First, I would like to touch briefly upon the facts

18
19

and two subsidiary issues.

The plaintiff has

argued that

20

summary judgment was in appropriate.

21

and complete;to my knowlege there was never any claim by

22

plaintiff that additional facts needed to be put into the

23

record.

24

judgment motion was filed, for additional time to prepare

25

affidavits or otherwise come forward with the showing that

But, discovery was full

There was never any request,when the defendant summary

26

1

Puls 56-E requires that there is evidence on material facts

i
|
2 I in dispute»

In addition, the plaintiff has advised this Court,

O

4

as it did the court below, that all of the evidence essential

5

to its case is in the record now before the Court»

6

On that record ——

7

Q

8 I drawn on

by the court from that were not enough»

9

A

I gather that they argue that these inferences

Mr. Justice, we urge this Court to draw its

10

own inference and I am sure that the Court will draw those

11

inferences fully in favor of the plaintiff.

12

We recognize that that is the burden upon

14

Q

us.

We

On this record ——
There are conflicts of fact here.

There are

15

conflicts in judgment as

to market, I suppose, but the issue

16

may be whether, assuming all of the facts to be as the plaintif:

17

urges them to be, his most ambitious statement of the facts,

18

if you will, making that assumption, has the plaintiff stated

19

a cause of action that would entitle him to recover under

20

Section 1 of the Clayton Act.

21

A

Sherman Act, sir.

22

Q

Of the Sherman Act, I mean. And I take it from

23

reading the opinion of the District Court, which was adopted,

24

as I remember, by the Court of Appeals; is that right?

25

A

Mr. Justice, there was a percuriam affirmants

27

1

by the Court of Appeals»
Q

2

All right.

That by

reading of the opinion

*->

of the District Court, I take it

that the District Court

4

concluded that making that assumption, everything that plaintiff

5

contends for to be established, that still does not constitute,

6

as matter of law, violation of Section 1.

7

A

I believe that is a fair interpretation.

8

Q

Mow why don't you tell us as succinctly as you

9

can the reason for the District Court's legal conclusion.
A

10

Very well, Your Honor, and I would say,before

It

attempting to answer this question, we do urge that,regardless

12

of the basis

13

Helvering and Gowron and the unbroken line of precedents, in a

14

summary judgment situation, such as is urged here, where only

15

questions of law are presented to the reviewing court, both

16

the Court of Appeals and this Court, whether or not the grounds

17

stated by the District Court were right or leave doubt or are

18

ambiguous, this Court is as fully able as the District Co'urfc

19

was to reach the purely legal conclusions that are necessary

20

in these circumstances.

for the District Court's decision in reliance upon

/

2!

V

■*

v

*

In essence, I think the one aspect of the District

22

Court decision, which plaintiff has most frequently pointed to

23

as suggesting

24

the District Judge, as to what was requisite to establishe

25

cause of action for tie-in violation under Section 1 whether

that there was a misconception on the part of

28

1

embellished or not under Section 2,

conspiracy

to monopolize

2

charge, was the District Court8s reference to the amount of

3

land that

4

parties in comparison

5

in Louisville, Kentucky for house development.

was affected by the arrangements between these
with the total land that was available

6

I would urge that, clearly, that market fact by

7

itself should not be determinative in a tie-in situation.

8

would urge

9

clearly, irrelevant to the facts of these cases, where the

I

equally strong, however, that that fact is not,

10

tying arrangement is one between,

11

supplier and his dealer, a middle man, who is taking the houses

12

and then making them available to the ultimate consumers, the

13

house residents.

14

if you will, a ravz material

I submit that in terms of a full analysis of this

15

kind of a tie-in arrangement, it is appropriate to look to

16

the question where other prefabricated house manufacturers were

17
18
19
20

the sellers of conventional house building materials in any
significant way, excluded from the market whether it is
confined to Louisville, Kentucky or more broadly.
Nov?, if I may try to articulate our position so that

21

the Court, understands clearly why we urge that summary judgment

22

is appropriate on this case, I will proceed.

23
24
25

Q

Suppose the First National Bank of Louisville

had been making him a loan and they required that he, to get
the loan, had to use

prefabricated material to build on these

29

1

houses; would that have violated the law?

2

A

I woule urge not, Your Honor.

3

Q

Well, that is what I supposed.

4

A

In no way.

5

Q

6
7

You are going to argue both the:monopolization

theory as well as the tie-in; are you?
A

I am going to urge, Mr. Justice, that the

0

monopolisation theory, as I understand it

9

the petition and the

10
11
12
13

to be stated in

plaintiff's main brief before this Court,

is not properly before this Court.
Q

But assuming that we should disagree with you

on that, are you going to argue the merits of ——
A

I am going to argue very simply and succinctly,

14

Mr. Justice, that this record is barren of

15

to establish the elements of a conspiracy to'monopolize,

IS

specific intent, the relevant market; I believe that your

17

decision in Walker Process, three terms ago, indicate that

18

an attempt or a conspiracy to monopolize,the relevant market

19

is in issue.

20

requisite evidence

As I believe Mr. Justice Brennan's question suggests

21

correctly, there would be a most substantial question in this

22

case as to whether the market can be limited to prefabricated

23
24
25

houses or whether the element of

cross-elasticity of demand

does not baring conventional houses into the market.
Now, that, in essence, is my argument on the conspiracy
30

1

to monopolize,, apart from my principal argument

2

of conspiracy

3

to be urging now, was never urged before either the District

4

Court or the Court of Appeals.

3

that the kind

8

from this record are.

9

We submit that plaintiff has not shown any fact

10

material to its anti-trust claim to be in dispute, to require

it

resolution by a jury, whether in terms of witness credibility,

12

conflicting evidence or otherwise.
In fact, the plaintiff has claimed continuously,

13
14

ineed, in his main brief to this Court that on this record it

15

is entitled to a directed verdict.

16

I submit, that there can be no question but that summary judg­

17

ment is appropriate.

10

The question is, what --

19

Q

However, that may be.

Now, in those circumstances,

To establish the plaint if

4

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

5

Q

Now, as I read the opinion of the court below,

6

and perhaps I am wrong, the court below said that he had not

7

shown either of those; is that right or wrong.

8

A

I believe that .is right.

9

Q

And the question is whether that conclusion

10

made the case appropriate for summary judgment or whether the

11

plaintiff was entitled to submit

12

to a jury, have a jury decide on those elements.

If there were any disputed issues of fact, yes,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Flinn, you may

continue your argument.
MR. FLINN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

7

court, if I may very briefly return to and dispose of

8

my argument in connection with this summary judgment question,

9

I would like to briefly state some considerations which I

10

hope will assist the court, and in any event, clear the

11

defendants' position.

12

At most we have differed with the plaintiff only

13

as to some of its characterisations of the evidence.

14

brief we have tried to set forth the evidence of record

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

In our

cited by the plaintiff essentially verbatim from the record
and have compared it with certain characterizations by the
plaintiff.
I think that clearly the most, perhaps the only,
significant area where we differ with the plaintiff's
characterizations is in the connection with the evidence
relied upon by the plaintiff to establish its claim that
the defendant's financing extended to the plaintiffs was
on more favorable terms than available from any other source,
including our competitors, other pre-fabricated manufacturers.
In the final analysis, that determination is for

25
33

the court, and for the court alone, and we expect the court
to draw every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiff.
g

Let's assume for the moment there was no

argument whatsoever, which I take it is certainly the core
of your argument that there is no dispute about historical
facts in the sense of who did what to whom, or things like
that, but if there had been a jury trial, what question would
have gone to the jury?
A

Mr. Justice White, I would —

q

Wouldn't that have been just historical facts?

A

Mr. Justice White, I would answer that question

by saying that I think upon the plaintiff's own characterizatio i
of the record, i.e., that it is a record that entitles it
to a directive verdict, it is quite possible that after a
trial with a jury sitting and hearing the evidence there
would have been no submission to the jury; that the court
would have direct —
Q

You have to say definitely that there wouldn't

have been any submission, don't you?
A

Yes, sir.

I am prepared to say that.

Q

Don't you have to say that?

A

I do say it.

g

You say there could have been no other

cons^lusion?
A

That in essence is my argument, Mr. Justice,

34

1

because we are prepared to accept any inferences that the

2

plaintiffs can reasonably argue from this record and they

3

have told us, and they have told the court, that the record

4

is complete and, indeed today, I believe the plaintiffs’

5

counsel has advised the court that at most any other evidence

6

that he would have put on would have been cummulative of

7

what is now in this record before the court.
Now, for the balance of my argument I shall assume

8
9
10

If
12
13
14
13
16
17

arguendo the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant’s financing
was extended on more favorable terras than available elsewhere
is the fair inference and is the inference that this court
will araw, because as I am trying to make clear, we, in no
way, dispute the evidence and we will accept whatever the
court concludes are the reasonable inferences from that
evidence.
I would like to point only to one aspect of this
record and ask the court particularly to notice nowhere
is there any evidence that the plaintiff objected to the

IQ
19
20

uefendant's houses, or in any way found them burdensome
or non-competitive at the time these arrangements were
negotiated and entered into.

21

Similarly, there is no evidence that the plaintiff

22
would have bought houses or building materials from any other
23
source absent the financing that was made available to it
24
by the de fendants.
25

35

1

Q

2

You are assuming then that the uniqueness of

the loan satisfied the first prong of the tying -—

3

A

I am assuming, Mr. Justice, that the loan was

4

offered, the commitment was made on more favorable terms

5

than were available elsewhere to this plaintiff.

6

Q

Namely —-

7

A

I will argue that that is not the uniqueness

8
9
10

within the sense of per se doctrine spelled out -—
g

You mean that doesn't show the crucial

economic power in the tying process.

s

!1

12
13
14
15

A

Exactly, exactly.

It does not permit such an

inference, Mr. Justice.
Q

But even if it did, I take it you are arguing

you should win, because of the lack of effect on the —
A

That would be a second prong to my argument.

16

I think honestly, Mr. Justice, the more significant argument

17

is that the claim that a tying element involves sufficient

18

economic power appreciably to retrain —

19

Q

Then you do have to contend with Loew's —

20

A

Definitely .

21

g

—showing, "...the crucial economic power may

22

be inferred from the tying product’s desirability to

23

consumers or from uni [ueness in its attributes."

24
25

A

Clearly Mr. Justice, I must face up to that case.

Now, to dispose of what I believe is the last
36

1

subsidiary issue, this question of the conspiracy to

2

moncpoiize, our position is very simple.

3

plaintiff has always alleged and argued a conspiracy to

4
5

monopolize in violation of Section 2.
>
The point we make is very simple:

S

courts below, and indeed we think on a fair reading of plaintif fs S

7

brief before this court, it has always urged that that

3

conspiracy, indeed its entire case, turned upon the existence

3

of a per se tying violation either as the objective or the

We admit that the

Before both

10

means of effecting the violations of both, Sections 1 and 2,

11

to the extent that the plaintiffs' brief — and I am still

12

uncertain after listening to counsel's argument today— but

13

to the extent that plaintiffs' brief argues before this

14

court that its conspiracy to monopolize does not turn upon ,

15

does not require proof of a per se tying violation, that

t

16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

was an argument never presented in the courts below.
Now, turning to this —
Q

Do you think the statement I read to you

out of Loew's was a holding — or is there any case that
holds that?
A

Mr. Justice, my view of Loew's is that honestly

I don't know exactly what the court meant when it used the
term "unique" there.

I x^ould lice to discuss that case in

considerable detail, as well as its place against the
background of all of this court's significant tie-in rule cases.
37

1

Now, let's again come back —

2

Q

I suppose that is a question we can resolve.

3

A

No question about that Mr. Justice.

If I can

4

be of any assistance, it would be the only reason for my

3

offering argument.

6

To come back to the central contention by the plaintif !' ,

7

it is very simple.

8

extended by defendant require the plaintiff to place no

9

equity into the land portion of the loan commitment, which

10

was something less than 15 percent of the total commitment

11

extended by the defendants, this was more favorable and

12

available from any other source and, therefore, in the

13

the tying element.

It claims that because the financing

10

Our contention very simply is that as a matter of

17

logic supported by the decisions of this court, you cannot

18

infer simply from the fact that the tying element is offered

19

on more favorable terms than available elsewhere that there

20

is economic power in that tying element.

21

Now, coming Mr. Justice White to the Loew's

22

decision, as this court knows^it involved the block booking

23

of copyright movie films.

24

economic power over the tying element is presumed when the

23

tying element is either patented or copyrighted.

It held that the requisite

Moreover, as the court well knows, the tying products
there were frequently forced upon unwilling purchasers.

3

Now, outside the patent and copyright areas, I urge

4

that the court has not defined "uniqueness" and I concede

5

my inability to tell this court what it meant when it used

6

the term "unique" in the Loew’s case.
I would urge, however, to the extent that it coupled

7
8

with that a reference to desirability to consumers, I think

9

that this must as a matter of common sense been intended by

iO

the court to mean something more than desirable in the sense

It

that one consumer buys 10 cents worth of the tying element.

12

That would establish sufficient economic power in practically

13

every product sold.

14

terms of some indicium of meaningful economic power.

I think the court meant something in

Indeed, the court has never merely assumed the

15
16

existence of economic power.

And I would point to the other

17

significant tying decisions of the court.
Times-Picayune examined market share.

18

And it was

19

held there that 40 percent was not a dominant position when

20

the other two sellers each had 30 percent of the relevant

21

market.
Now, in Northern Pacific the court found substantial

economic power over the tying land on a combination of

24

factors.

Third, the land was frequently essential to the

businesses of the buyers and lessees who were subjected to

4

the tie-in conditions.

5

Fourth, the host of tying arrangements affected by

6

the defendant without any reasonable explanation for the

7

existence of the restraint.

8

And finally, this court concluded that the
defendant's purpose there obviously was to fence out

competitors and the nature of the tie was that the fencing

Leases of long terms.

Nov;, concededly there may be cases where economic

14
15

power over the tying element can be inferred indirectly

16

from proof that the buyers were economically coerced to

17

accept knowingly an inferior, burdensome, non-competitive

18

tie product.
Pointing back to the facts, or the absence of

19
20

facts, that I tried to bring to the court's attention a

21

moment ago, here in this case there is no evidence that the

22

plaintiff considered the defendant's houses the tie product

23

to be of this character when it negotiated the arrangements

24

now challeneged.
Consequently, we urge this is not a case of economic

Mr. Justice, I think perhaps you and I differ

with all due respect somewhat in our semantic use of the
phrase "economic coercion".

I am using economic coercion in

the sense of Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in the
Northern Pacific case.
Economic coercion in a tying context where a fair
inference of economic power over the tying element can be
drawn from the fact that it is obvious from the arrangement

Q

Is it the submission here that the petitioner

says he should have been allowed to present to a jury?
A

My point Mr. Justice is he never made that

contention until months after the arrangement had been entered
into, until months after he had come back for a second helping
of more of the same kind of financing.
So his frame of mind, which I believe •—
Q

Is this pari delicto?

A

No, sir, it is not.

It is an assertion, if

your Honor will, that one element which may have to be
looked at in reaching a conclusion as to economic power over
the tying element is what was the state of mind of the
buyer at the time he entered into this.
Q

That sounds like a statement on your part

that would be a most regretable error, a mistake in judgment,
for the jury to decide that this is economic coercion.

That

doesn’t get you very far.
A

My argument Mr. Justice is that the economic

21

22

coercion if it arises in a tying case exists at the time the
parties affectuate the arrangements between them.

It is only

23

in terms of the buyer's state of mind at that time that you
24

can ascertain whether or not there was economic coercion.

Now, to go on with the question.

It seems to me

if your question fairly states the plaintiff's position that he
could not have gotten into the building business through any
other financing means but for the more favorable terms obtained
from the defendants, then the case is disposed of automatically
without getting into the question of sufficient economic power.
It follows that there was no foreclosure of competition.

This

plaintiff would have been unable to buy any competitor's
pre-fabricated houses, any competitor's conventional house
building material.
Now, we fully recognize that this court approaches
tying arrangements, quite properly so, with suspicion.

Indeed,

the court has repeatedly said that they serve hardly any
purpose beyond the suppression of competition.
At the same time, even under the more easily
established standards of Section 3 of the Clayton Act, the

16
court has recognized that tying arrangements are not inevitably
17
anti-competitive.

And without going into the details, we

18
respectfully refer court to the Sinclair Refining Case,
1©
whichxwas cited in some detail in our brief.
20
We urge where tying product is claimed to be
21

unique, solely because it is offered at a lower price or
22
on more favorable terms, it cannot logically be inferred
23
from that fact standing alone, that sufficient economic power
24
over the tying element to constitute a per se violation.
25
43

i

I would ask the court to consider the following few

2

examples:

3

to paying a lower price for the tying product simply because

4

he considers the package to offer the best available terms

5

for the combination of products he wants, not because the

6

seller has economic power over the tying element or because

7

the buyer is coercised to take a tiedproduct that he doesn't

B

want.

A buyer may take a tying product as the condition

Indeed, the fact that the tying product must be

9
10

offered on more favorable terms may suggest that it lacks even

11

competitive parity in the market for the tying product.
Further, even a seller with no economic power may

12
13

use a tying product as a loss leader to promote the sale of

14

the tied product.By selling the tying product at a loss in

15

effect he reduces the price of the tied product he is selling.
Now, we respectfully submit that in Northern Pacific

16

17

this court appears to have recognized that offering the

18

tying product on more favorable terms may imply the absence

13

of economic power.

20

appears to have given woig^^ to the fact that the defendant

21

the® made no claim that the tying land came any cheaper than

22

if the tying condition had not been imposed.

23

My time is about to empire.

Specifically, the majority opinion there

Unless the seller either increases his price for

10

his goods, or recovers in the form of interest the full cost

11

of his forgoing receipt of the funds, he has reduced the

12

price of his goods.

13

If the seller offers credit or financing on more

14

favorable terms than available elsewhere, to that extent he

15

has also reduced the price of his goods.

16

We submit that such financing unique because offered

on more favorable terms than available elsewhere is price

As such, the financing

For all of these reasons we submit that the judgment
below should be reaffirmed.
If the court has no further questions, I shall
conclude, Mr. Chief Justice.
(Whereupon, at 12;50 p.m., the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.)
