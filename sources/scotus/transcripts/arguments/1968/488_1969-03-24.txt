ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONRAD K. HARPER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HARPER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.

n

This case concerns two black ladies who were refused

12

service at the recreational facility called Lake Nixon Club

13

located just outside of Little Rock, Arkansas.
The respondents are the owners of Lake Nixon Club,

14

IS

Mr. and Mrs. Paul.
Following the refusal of that facility to serve the

16
17

petitioners, black ladies, they brought a class action in

18

the District Court sitting in Little Rock for a junctive

19

relief.

20

Nixon was not a facility subject to Title 2 of the 1964

21

Civil Rights Act, specifically holding that the food facilities

22

at Lake Nixon were not embraced within the statute and also

23
24
25

The District Court following the trial held that Lake

that Lake Nixon was not a place of entertainment or exhibition
within the ambit of the statute.
The District Court also summarily rejected the claim

>3

made by respondents below that Lake Nixon Club was a bona fide

2

private club»

t

3

On appeal the Eighth Circuit affirmed on all grounds with

4

one judge dissenting» This Court granted certiorari not only

S

to determine questions relating to coverage under Title 2 of

6

the 1964 Act but additionally on the question whether the 1866

1981 and 1982 acted to bar discrimination in this facility.

Act now partially codified as 42 U.S„C» Sections

arguments.

First, that Lake Nixon food facilities were such

as to bring the whole of Lake Nixon within the ambit of Title 2.
Second, that Lake Nixon in its entirety was a place of enter­
tainment or exhibition within the terms of Title 2.

And

thirdly, that 1981 and 1982 insofar as they granted an equal
right to contract and have an interest in property granted
petitioners the right to have access to Lake Nixon.
The facts in this case are relatively simple and not
in dispute.

Lake Nixon is a 232 acre site located not far from

Little Rock, Arkansas, which has facilities for boating,
and swimming and picknicking and miniature golf.

It also has

a snack bar which serves sandwiches, soft drinks and milk,
and it also has in that

snack bar a juke box.

Lake Nixon also advertises its facilities, specifi­
cally the record shows that during its normal season which
runs from May until September every year, Lake Nixon ran in
4

\

1966;, three advertisements every week on a radio station in

2

Little Rock as well as utilised the facilities of another

3

Little Rock station for a similar kind of announcement.

4

Those announcements, incidentally,

the record

S

reflects were addressed to all members of Lake Mixon and would

6

could purchase a membership, so called, in this facility

7

simply by paying a quarter for each season.

Lake Nixon also advertised-- Q A quarter for each time they come there, each time
they visit or was it just a quarter for
A

A quarter for the entire season, ycur Honor.

In other words, from May until September and after obtaining
this admission card one then had to pay an additional money if
he wanted to buy something at the snack bar but he might not
pay anything if he went there simply to go there picnicking
or swimming.
Q

I see.

A

Lake Nixon also advertised its facilities

in a magazine distributed locally showing facilities open
called "Little Rock Today."

That was done once the record

shows in 1966, and also once in 1966 Lake Nixon distributed
an advertisement in a publication which was distributed at the
air force base located in Jacksonville, Arkansas.
Q

Are those advertisements written in the text

of those advertisements?
25

A

1

No, your Honor, what is on file with the court

2

but not printed is a copy of the radio copy used in the radio

3

announcements»
The announcements with reference to the magazines

4
5

are not printed in the appendix, are not a part of the record

6

in this case.
Q

7

It is simply testimony that such will run.
Does the record indicate whether or not those

B

ads the one in the military magazine or the publication are

9

the one in the publication distributed by the Chamber of

10
11

Commerce or whatever it was in the hotels were also purportedly
addressed to "members"?
A

IE

13
14
15

says that all advertisements are addressed to all members of
Lake Nixon.

17

19

20
21

22

25

Q

Yes.

A

Now Title 2 hcis a comprehensive scheme for

coverage for public accommodations as defined specifically
with regard to food facilities it says that a food facility
may be covered if it serves or offers to serve interstate
travelers or substantial portion of the food which it serves
moves in commerce.
The evidence shows here as we have just been talking,

23
24

What

there is is a general statement by Mr. Paul as I recall which

16

18

There is no specific testimony on that.

that Lake Nixon during 1966 advertised its facilities and the
✓

evidence further shows that Lake Nixon was open to the general
6

1

white public»

Having advertised its facilities to the public

z

in general it seems clear to us that Lake Nixon was in fact

3

offering its services to members of the interstate public

4

and therefore for purposes of Title

5

facilities were open to persons in the general public»

2,

Lake Nixon’s food

That being so the statute then provides that all

6
7

other facilities which are open to the people patronizing the

8

food facility are open pursuant to Title 2»
The District Court took a different view on this

9
10

particular question.

11

been no offer to serve interstate travelers as such,

12

believe that is a misconstruction of the statute.

The District Court found that there had
W@

Congress had

13

in mind simply an offer to serve people in general and if there

14

were not any evidence of a prohibition on interstate travelers

15

or in this case, no inquiry even as to where people came from

16

indeed Mr. Paul didn’t even know how many members there were

17
18
19

although he estimated about 100,000, we think that is sufficient
to bring this lunch counter and therefore the whole of Lake
Nixon within the ambit of the statute.
Also, with regard to the food facilities there is

20
21

22
23
24
25

the test that a substantial portion of the food moved in
commerce.

The evidence on this issue was simply that Lake

Nixon at its snack bar served hamburgers, hot dogs, soft
drinks and milk.

The District Court made a specific finding

that the ingredients used in the soft
7

drinks and the

1

ingredients used in the bread were such as had moved in

2

Interstate Commerce»

3

However, he deemed that

insufficient for coverage

4

under Title 2.

5

made an additional finding that in its view milk at least was

6

locally produced»

The Eighth Circuit not disturbing that finding

We submit that since Lake Nixon sold only four

7
8

principal items, three of which, that is, the hamburgers, soft

9

drinks and hot dogs contained out-of-state ingredients this

’50

was sufficient to meet any kind of reasonable substantiality

11

test and therefore Lake Nixon as a whole was covered by

12

Title 2.

13

The District Court took the view that that was not

'14

the case and the Eighth Circuit similarly took a view»

15

part, said the District Court, Lake Nixon was a whole facility

18

not principally engaged in selling food for consumption on

17

the premises»

18

In

We, of course, disagree with that on the grounds that

19

Lake Nixon's snack bar at least principally was engaged for

20

serving food for consumption on that premises and therefore

21

the whole of Lake Nixon was covered.

22

An additional ground of Title 2 is the claim that

23

Lake Nixon was an entertainment facility or place engaged in

24

giving exhibitions.

25

We specifically note here that the Juke

boxes were found by the District Court to have been acquired
8

1

1

outside the State of Arkansas.

2

to us the juke box was naturally a source of entertainment for

3

persons who may listen or perhaps dance to it and therefore

4

this was sufficient for purposes of coverage to say that

S

Lake Nixon was place that had entertainment or exhibitions,

6

which moved in commerce.

1

That being the case it seems

Additionally, however, the evidence shows that Lake

8

Nixon had so-called surf boards or yaks

8

from an Oklahoma company and furthermore that from the same

10

Oklahoma company Lake Nixon had leased certain paddle boats.

11

We think this is sufficient again to show that Lake Nixon8s

12

sources of entertainment had affected commerce and therefore

which were purchased

13

Lake Nixon as a whole was subject to the ambit of Title 2„

14

And we would mention here as another and further

15

ground for showing that Lake Nixon was a place of entertainment

IS

or exhibition that local peoplemight well come there to be

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

entertained either by their family, by their friends or
exhibiting their prowess in any given area of Lake Nixon's
facilities.
For the Fifth Circuit sitting an banc

in the Miller

case this kind of activity was sufficient to define a place
of entertainment and we submit the same is true here.
Q

Didn’t one of the advertisements indicate there

was an orchestra there, music at least on the week-ends?
A

That is right.

Dances were given every Friday
9

1

or Saturday at Lake Nixon.

2

further that the musicians that played live at those dances

3

apparently were only from Pulaski County, or were not in

4

commerce within the meaning of the statute.

5

6

7
8
9

Q

The evidence, however, does show

No, I was just thinking about whether or not it

was a place of entertainment.
A

Oh, yes.

We say that was an additional source

showing it was a place of entertainment.
That being so with regard to Title 2 we turn then

10

to possible coverage under the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

II

was specifically pleaded in this case in the complaint.

12

of the courts below passed upon it because this court's

13

decision in Jones versus Mayer Company was not handed down

14

until after the Eighth Circuit denied rehearing in this case.

15

We think it manifest that this was an ordinary kind

1981
None

16

of contractual arrangment, one paid money and in return had

17

the option of availing himself of services located at Lake

18

Nixon and the evidence is uncontroverted that the petitioners

19

in this case were denied that right, that contractual right

20

if you will on the grounds of race.

21

clearer as violative of 1981.

22

We think nothing could be

With regard to 1982 which provides for equal property

23

rights and no denial thereof on the grounds of race, we think

24

it clear also that what really was involved here was one had

25

the opportunity to use the property of Lake Nixon, either its
10

juke boxes or its miniature golf or its sxfimming facilities

1

2

-

and therefore the rationale of the Jones case would indicate

3

that this kind of property should not be denied to persons on

4

grounds of race»

S

Q

1982 was not relied on in the pleading was it?

6

A

That is right»

It was not pleaded below and

7

none of the courts below ruled upon the issue.

8

court granted certiorari and we think that there is ample

9

authority for this court to dispose of the* case on that ground

10

of it wishes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRIS LEONARD, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES- AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. LEONARD:

7
8

the Court.
I suppose that the first question that would corse

9
10
11
12

to anyone's mind at our appearance here is why the central
Government should be interested in a case which might appear
to be of relatively minor importance.
It may well be on the facts as such it is, but there

13
14

IS
16

17
18
19
20

21

22
23

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

are three very important reasons why the FederalGovernment is
cmcerned about not only the issues in this case but the case
itself.
First of all, Little Rock, Arkansas, has an air force
base located there which there are some 15,000 military
civilian personnel and the dependents of those people.

In a

j county the size of Pulaski County which is roughly 285,000,
according to the census figures, this is a rather substantial
population and it gives to the Federal Government a rather
substantial interest in seeing to it that the people that work
for the Federal Government are in fact accorded all their due
according to Federal law as Federal law applies so we have that
12

1

2

kind of an interest in our employees»
Secondly* Title 2 specifically section 204 cf the

3

Act of '64 gives some unusual obligations to the Attorney

4

General with respect to the question of public accommodations.

5

And we are, therefore, interested in the case because of that

6

admonition in Title 2»

7

Thirdly, we are eoxicerned and interested because we

8

believe that the principle in this case is one on which we

9

would like to have some settlement, some opinion, a decision

10

by this court, so that we will get some guide to future action

II

in this kind of case»

14
15

20
21

22
23

24
25

We feel very strongly that our nation has made and
is making great progress in the area of bringing equal voting,
equal employment, equal housing and other equal opportunities
to our Negro citizens»
Negroes in greater numbers than ever before albeit
there are still too few in number, are beginning to share the
fruits of our free economy»

But first class citizenship doesn’t

mean just a good job or the right to vote, or sending your
youngster to a desegregated

school»

We think that first class citizenship means much
more than that.
our free society.

It means the sharing of in all the fruits of
It means taking mama out to dinner on

Sunday and be able to sit anyplace in the restaurant or go to
any restaurant or taking the kids for a swim on a hot Sunday
13

1

or taking your daughter out to begin to teach her the basic

2

golf at the Lake Nixon miniature golf course.

3

So from the philosophical point of view we have a

4

very deep interest in what the Court decides in this particular

5

case.
Let me just briefly analyse what our feeling is

6

?

with respect to the opinions below.
The District Court we feel got hung up so to speak

8
S

on the issue of the single enterprise, the fact that these

10

were not the enterprises at Lake Nixon were not separate units,

11

that the snack bar is not owned by someone else, the swimming

12

facilities and so on.
We would submit to the Court that that is immaterial

13
14

to a customer.

15

the facility or whether a group of people each own each one

16

of the separate and individual facilities and that further

17

t hat that concept finds no rationeil basis in Section 201 of

18
19

He doesn't care whether one person owns all

the Act.
There is nothing in there that indicates that

20

Congress had that intent and if it did it could have put some

21

verbage in it which would have very easily delineated that

22

intention such as principally engaged in this or under separate

23

ownership or some verbage that would have given a clue that

24

one could come to the kind of conclusion that the District

25

Court came to.
14

1
2

And thus we feel the District Court was in error in
the way it applied the law to these particular facts.

3

The Circuit Court of Appeals,it used the hook that

4

there was no effect on Interstate Commerce.

3

submit to the Court, that this runs contrary to common knowledge

6

and common understanding.

?

Well, I would

Little Rock, Arkansas, is not a sleepy little hamlet

8

back out in the woods somewhere.

9

installation in it.

It has a major military

It is the hub of a great State, it is

iO

on traffic routes both north and south and east and west, so

11

it isn't very back in the woods.

12

And the issue whether or not there was an offer to

13

serve any of these facilities assuming that they are covered

14

under the

15

of Appeals took the view that it wasn't going to consider that

16

question because it did not feel there was any affect on

17

Commerce and then it labored over the issue of what percentage

18

of the ingredients in the food or soda water or whatever else

19

might come to Lake Nixon pursuant to Interstate Commarce.

20

•,’provisions of Section 201(b) but the .Circuit Court

We would ask. the Court to reject that idea.

There

2?

is ample evidence this Court, can use its knowledge, its

22

common sense, things that are of common knowledge to come to

23

a very ready conclusion that advertising three

24

on the radio station in Little Rock, Arkansas, with 15,000

25

people just at the military installation alone plus the
15

nights a week

1

travelers that there were bound to be people who were attracted

2

by the ad.

3

Common knowledge also would tell you that a family

4

staying at a motel might well ask the motel proprietor whether

5

or not his motel has any arrangement with Lake Nixon to use

6

its facilities and certainly it became knowledge, common

7

knowledge around the air force base that transient or not,

8

if you were white you could use the facilities at Lake Nixon

9

but if you were black you couldn’t, and I submit to this Court

to

that now common knowledge tell us that there were, that most

11

of the people who were at Little Rock Mr Force Base were

12

transients, not in the sense that they were there for a few

13

l.

days but in the sense that they were residents of another
State and they are just as much in Interstate Commerce as are
the people who are driving through, the truck driver the family
on vacation, the salesman, what have you.
And they are entitled just as much to the protection
of the law and the Constitution.
Now then let us get to the more difficult issue.
The issue of whether or not we can in fact find coverage in
Section (b).

In either 3 under the entertainment and exhibi­

tion provision or under 4 as what I term a combined enterprise.
I believe this Court can find justification in this case under
both these theories and I would urge the Court to consider the
possibility of finding its decision on both of these theories
16

1

because both will then become useful»
Look at the decisions in the Evans case which the

2
3

Circuit Court of Appeals below used to rule against the

4

plaintiffs»

5

that Fazzio, that the Miller case are amusement cases and what

6

they in effect say is that Congress when it enacted this

?

section used that particular and specific verbage in 201|b)(3)

8

or other place of exhibition or entertainment meant that a

9

roller skating rink was a place of entertainment»

I would point out to you that the Evans case

A bowling alley was a place of entertainment, that

10

11

a golf course was a place of entertainment.

12

at the Evans decision particularly the District Court said I

13
14

15
16

j
find that because that this is a place of entertainment and
that because a team comes once a year from Washington, D„ C.,
to Virginia to play golf, that brought it within the purview
of the Act.
I say that the District Court v;as really saying and

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24

ZB

And when one looks

really doing was saying that a golf course was a place of
entertainment because it seems to me not logical to assume
that there is going to be very many people who come to watch
an amateur golf team play its counterpart from the Laurel
Golf Club»

That is not going to attract any droves onto

any of the fairways except maybe some of their friends who
may be waiting at the 18th hole»
So I say that that is not an exhibition in the term
17

1

that we ordinarily think of a football game or basketball game

2

and the like and that Section 201(b){3) specifically assumed

3

and those cases clearly indicate this kind of entertainment,

4

the entertainment one gets out of participating as opposed

5

to exhibit.
1 urge the Court to consider also finding that the

G
1

provisions of 201(b)(4), the combined establishment theory

8 clearly apply here.
The Congress could have used different verbage if it

3
10

didn't mean that if you have one of the facilities that are

11

covered under 2 in 4 the whole thing is covered and that makes

12

sense. I think that is reasonable to believe that Congress

13

wanted to do that, at least say a whole line of cases whether

14

it be department stores or bowling alleys or what it is.

15

on that theory also we believe that there is coverage.
Mr. Harper went into the issue of the coverage

16
17
18

under the 1866 Act.

Q

23
24
25

I suppose you would make the same argument if

there was just a vending machine there vending candy bars?
A

21

22

We would simply urge the Court to consider

that.

19
20

So

I don't see, your Honor, how you make a contract

with a vending machine the way you do with somebody selling
hot dogs.
Q

I know but it is —

Q

You don't get your dime back.
18

1

A

Well? I suppose you would have a right to sue.

2

Q

But you think the volume of merchandise at

3

the lunch counter sold is wholly irrelevant don't you?

4

A

1 think it is an either-or situation.

5

Q

Under your combined enterprise theory it could

6

have sold 1/iOOth of 1 percent of the total gross and you

1

still would make this argument?

8

10

A

Yes, I v;ould because you either have to sell

merchandise which moves in Interstate Commerce or you have
to serve people.
\

11

Q

This is the theory in the lower court wasn't

12

it that the establishment didn't really amount to much in

13

terras of the overall gross?

14

A

The overall gross was 23 percent but the District

15

Court did not attempt to find nor was there evidence offered

16

at the District Court level with respect to wrhat percentage

of that actually moved in Interstate Commerce.
Q

Didn't it make the point that the eating estab­

lishment really wasn't, very important in terms of the overall
operations of the club?
A

Oh, your Honor, please I would like to point

out two important statements that the trial court judge said
that this was a necessary adjunct to this business.

Mr. Paul

himself testified at page 85 of the appendix.
No, I am sorry.

It is in the District Court record.

He said that this* that the lunch counter was a necessity.
Q

Did the Court of Appeals say this was a

covered establishment under Section 4?
A

The Court of Appeals didn't answer that question

S

because they simply said it had no effect on commerce* it did

6

not offer to serve interstate travelers and therefore it

7

wasn't necessary to decide.

•
i

8

Q

How about the District Court?

9

A

The District Court said that it was not a

10

covered establishment under either category 3 or 4 or category

11

2, the lunch counter itself was not covered so it never got

12

to the issue of whether or not there w?as an affect on Interstate

13

Commerce but the District Court said let us recall that it is

54

of page 57, of course, it is probably true that some out of

15

state people spending time in and around Little Rock have

56

utilized one or both facilities.

17

I think that combined with the Air Force Base

18

combined with the nature of Little Rock, the nature of the

19

advertising, and by the way I would like to just close on

20

that point -— the Court if anything should use the ad it seems

21

to me against the defendant because o the fact that they had

22

the audacity to advertise this member situation knowing full

23

well it wTas a sham.

24

admitted under oath that it was a ruse and a sham. They didn't

25

put it into effect until after the time the 8 64 Act came into

It was a ruse and a sham and they

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
Lake Nixon used to be called the Nixon farm.
232 acres mostly of hillside.

It is

You get to it by following a

10

street called 12th Street out of Little Rock which becomes a

11

country road, paved, and at a point if you know exactly where

12

it is, you can turn right without the help of a sign, you can

13

dirab a steep hill and you can come down and you can find

14

Lake Nixon.

15

Q

Is it a natural lake, Mr. Gallman?

18

A

It is made by a dam put in a small creek which

17

doesn't run the year round, and the roadway traverses the top
of the dam and this is how you arrive at the Nixon farm.
Q

You say there is no sign?

A

Not on the highway.

Q

The highway.

A

There is a way to come in from the back and

perhaps that road is paved now.

The last time I was there

you could not get in from the rear, that is from the west and
north because the road was too rocky, and you just couldn't be
21

5

sure you would make it.
Now this narrow little valley between two hills

comes down to a small lake which is a swimming area, is perhaps

two acres.

I wouldn't stick with that but it is a relatively

west from where the creek comes that is usually kind of green

8

and mossy and not attractive.
After you come in on the dam you can turn right and

record about 1962.

Since then it has been operated by Mr. and

Mrs. Paul.
It, as I say, is a shallow little lake.

It has a

place where you dress, a rather small little building.

This

lunch counter or dining room we are talking about is I would
guess 8 by 12 feet perhaps.

It has, now I have never seen

the miniature golf course that they have there, but I assume
it does, but mostly there is a little spit of land that runs
out into this two acres of water on which people sun and from
which they can hop off and get wet.
Now7 except near the dam the water is not to my
knowledge over your head.

As I say it is a shallow lake.
22

It is

particularly unattractive in the late summer because of health

reasons and because of a lack of fresh water coining into it.

Is there any estimate of how many people go

The record says 100,000 which surprises me.

I haven't seen it since the Pauls have had it.

How do they get in there, by helicopter?

They sure would have to come in there bumper

incidentally I have no apprehension that anyone from Little

In the first place it is 15 miles from the city limits
of Little Rock.

Little Rock Air Force base which should make somewhere near
45 to 50 miles before you get from the Air Force Base to this
little farm.

You go through Little Rock and then you go

northwest of Little Rock some 1Smiles further to get to the

they could.

It only operates from some time in May until school

But it was advertised in a publication?

A

I understand that from the record it appeared

at least once a year in the Air Force magazine or newspaper
at the Air Base.
Today.

I understand it appeared once in Little Rock
