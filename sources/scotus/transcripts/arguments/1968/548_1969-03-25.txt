MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Simon, you may proceed

with your argument.

ARGUMENT OF J. MINOS SIMON, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

6

MR. SIMON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it plea£?e the Court:

7

The case presents for the consideration of the Court

8

the validity of a State statute enacted by the 1967 Legislative

9

Session of Louisiana.

10

The issues presented are composed and framed by the

11

pleadings, inasmuch as the lawsuit instituted by the plaintiff

12

was dismissed in connection with a motion to dismiss filed by

3
4
5

24

the defendants in this case.
The decision relies upon the holding of this Court in
the case of Hannah versus Larche which involved an interpreta­
tion of the Commission on Civil Rights, or the Civil Rights
Commission, that was enacted by Congress recently, and also
partly relies upon a decision of the highest court of the State
of Louisiana interpreting or giving its own interpretation of
what this Court held and what is the effect of the particular
statute in question.
That decision was rendered in Marfcone versus Morgan,
which is before this Court on rehearing.

It is docketed under

No. 216 on the docket of the 1968 term of the Court.
The plaintiff, in substance, complains that the Act,

25
2

1

as a matter of law, is unconstitutional, .and also, as admin­

2

istered against him, the plaintiff allegas that he is a member

3

of a trade union, and that the Act in question has been admin­

4

istered discriminatorily against him and members of the union in

5

question, resulting in repressive actions.
I submit to Your Honors that the Hannah decision did

6
7

not involve the type of legislation that is involved in the case

8

before you»

9

tial structure of the commission that was created by this Act,

I think perhaps a very quick reference to the essen­

10

as well as its function, will illustrate the point that I am

11

emphasizing at this time.
The Act was passed as an emergency act in the State of

12
13

Louisiana, apparently resting under the allegation that there was

14

some labor strife in the community of the State Capital of

15

Louisiana.

16

created what is designated as a "Labor-Management Commission of

17

Inquiry."

18
19

20
21

25

The Legislature, in the enactment of this statute,

Significantly, this agency, or this commission, operates
on an ad hoc basis.

It operates only when the Governor of the

State demands or requests that it operate, and it investigates
only in that area outlined and delineated by the Governor him­
self in requesting the investigation.
It is significant to point out that all the officials
of State Government., from the top to the very bottom, every
employee, every agency, every department, every commission, are
3

v

1

impressed into cooperative service with fch© members of this

2

commission, by virtue of the provisions of Section SSO.SCd).

3

We should also like to emphasize that the investigative

4

forces of the commission can be assigned to the State Police and ,

5

during that assignment, they have all the powers of State Police.

6

The commission itself has endowed itself, or been en­

7

dowed, with plenary powers of subpoena»

It can take depositions

8

anywhere in the United States»

9

to its orders through the process of contempt proceedings.

And also, it can compel obedience

10

Equally significant is the fact that this commission

11

expressly does not have any power or authority or jurisdiction

12

to investigate, to hold hearings, or seek to ascertain the facts,

13

or make any reports or recommendations as to any of the strictly

14

civil aspects of any labor problem or dispute.
*

15

It is limited exclusively to investigating and deter­

16

mining the existence of any criminal law violation, both of the

17

State and the Federal laws, that may occur in the area of labor-

18

management relations.

19

Not only this, but it must conduct public hearings as

20

to any such inquiry.

21

but then only on the request of one commission member who, in

22
23
24
25

It can conduct or hold Executive Sessions,

his opinion, may feel that there may be a defamatory content or
incriminatory content to th® investigation®
However, it has full power, as X stated, to bring all
witnesses before it, to interrogate these witnesses as to the

4

1

existence of any crime, whether they are of Federal or State

2

origin,,
These hearings must be public, and furthermore, it is

3
4

charged with the responsibility of making findings, and these

5

findings relate to the existence of, or probable existence of,

6

criminal law violations, and also to pronouncing official judg­

7

ment on individuals who may be involved in the criminal law

8

violation in question, relating to labor-management affairs.

9

Not only is this commission under the mandatory duty

TO

of making these public findings, but in addition to that, this

11

commission is under the mandatory duty of publicizing these

12

findings.

13

Then furthermore, after it has conducted these public

14

hearings, after it has made these public findings, and after

15

it has publicized these public findings, it then becomes its

IS

mandatory duty to report its findings and recommendations, to

17

18
19
20
21

22

23
24
25

“proper Federal and State authorities charged with the responsi­
bility of prosecution of criminal offenses."
I submit to Your Honors that this piece of legislation
establishes a public body that has (1) an accusatory function;
(2) that it must make and it can pronounce official judgments
on individuals; and (3) that it must publicise both the findings
as to the existence or probable existence of criminal conduct
*

and as to the individuals who may be involved; and that further­
more, this is a part of a criminal process.

Now, essentially it is an inquiry into brain worthi­

ness.

responsibility of instituting criminal proceedings themselves

4

should not decide to do so, the commission has the authority

5

to direct the chairman to proceed directly to the filing of such

6

criminal charges, both with the Federal and the State authori­

1

ties.

If the authorities, or the authorities charged with the

Also, the commission may request that the Governor

request the Attorney General to utilise all the powers of his

10

office in the supervision of all the districts attorneys through­

11

out the Stata, to carry out the recommendations and the findings

12

made by —
Q

13

I take it then, as far as the filing of charges

14

is concerned, that the action of the commission is only a recom­

15

mendation?

16

file a complaint with a law enforcement officer, I suppose, like

17

any citizen can, but they can't officially launch a criminal

18

action.

They can't, themselves, effectively file — they can

19

A

Not in the technical sense of the word.

20

Q

The law enforcement officer still has to make his

21

decision as to whether to actually file the charge and institute

22

a criminal proceeding„

23

A

24

My position is that by then, that is somewhat anti-

25

That is correct, Your Honor.

climactic, because the individual involved has already been
6

1

guilty by the commission, and his guilt was preceded by a public

z

hearing.

3

Q

Well, the commission has arrived at its opinion

4

of the matter, I take it, but it certainly doesn’t bind the

5

lav/ enforcement official.

6

A

7

official, technically.

8

Q

It doesn’t even

bind him to

file the charge.

9

A

It doesn’t even

bind him to

file the charge, but

10

I am sure it doesn‘t bind the law enforcement

I am sure that in the ordinary affairs of public government,
where that same District Attorney, by virtue of the provisions

12

of the statute, himself is impressed cooperatively as a member

of this commission.

4

commission.

In other words, he must cooperate with this

Every State officer, every employee of the State of

15

Louisiana, is impressed cooperatively into service with this

IS

commission.

7

Q

Does Louisiana use a Grand Jury?

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

20
21

22
23
24
25

I suppose there are some crimes that require

indictment by a Grand Jury.
A
require that.

Murder is one of them; I mean capital offenses
Otherwise, the District Attorney may file charges

involving anything short of a capital offense.
Q

I suppose, then, that

the Grand Jury might

reject indicting someone, even though the commission has

7

1

recommended it»

2

.

A

3

I am sure that is a possibility, -.'Your Honor»
As a practical matter, with all the prior pub­

4

licity, with the public condemnation that attaches to the indivi

5

dual and to the crime involved --

6

Q

You suggest that as a practical matter, no pro­

7

secutor could afford to reject one of these recommendations

8

insofar as filing the complaint is concerned»

9

A

It would be my judgment that it would be a hasard

10

ous position for him to assume.

11

couageous, independent-minded, public prosecutor to resist the

12

force that would be generated by all this prior publicity, be­

13

cause this is an open hearing.

14

He would have to be a very

.Hhiie the commission may conduct executive hearings,

15

it cannot refer to that or use that evidence as part of its

16

findings unless all that evidence heard in executive hearing

17

is heard anew in a public hearing.

18

public hearings, you have the television people there, xvith

19

their cameras grinding away and publicising all that is going

20

on before the commission; and furthermore, there are no effect­

21

ive rules of evidence, meaningful rules of evidence.

22
23
24
25

And, of course, in these

The com­

mission hears everything — hearsay evidence, opinion evidence,
innuendos, just anything it chooses to hear, it hears, because
there is nothing to regulate the scope and the character of the
evidence which is brought before it.

t

Q

Was Mr. Jenkins summoned before this commission?

2

A

Mo, sir? he -wasnst summoned.

3

The companion party

in this litigation was, in the lower court.

4

Q

What is Mr. Jenkins1 interest in it?

5

A

Mr. Jenkins interest is;

Number 1, he is a merabe

6

of the labor union which has been singled out by the officials

7

who have administered this Act.
Q

8
9

Is there anything in the record to indicate that

they were interested in Mr. Jenkins as an individual?
A

10

The pleadings would indicate that, Your Honor.

11

As I stated, the issues are composed and framed by the pleadings

12

This was dismissed on a motion by the defense, to dismiss.

13

Q

What did the pleadings say about it?

14

A

The pleadings state that he is a member of

15

Teamsters Local

IS
17
18

Union No. 5.

Q

It alleges that he is in fear of being investi­

A

Yes.

gated?
Not only investigated, if Your Honor please

19

he has been charged with four separate offenses in connection

20

with the investigations.

9

21

Q

Charges by whom?

22

A

The charge was in the name of the District Attorr ey

23

of one of the parishes in Louisiana; however, it was initiated

24

by the Attorney General, who was acting in cooperation with the

25

Labor-Management Commission of Inquiry.
9

1

q

Did those charges originate with the commission?

2

A

Yes, sir.

3

Essentially, yes, sir.

They origi­

nated on the entire investigation, if Your Honor please»

4

Furthermore, he charges that these charges against him,

5

if Your Honor please, we re filed by the officials when they knew

6

they ware false charges, and they knew that he was not involved.

7

He has attempted to get a hearing before the State Courts in

8

Louisiana, and he has been unsuccessful.

9

this matter.
Q

10

That is all recited in

Is there anything in the record to show that this

11

man has ever been called, ever been summoned, or that he will be

12

summoned?
A

13
14

that he will be.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

I think the implicit import of the pleading is

Q

What is the explicit allegation with respect to

A

Well, he didn't allege that he had done something

that?

or something had happened which actually did not occur, if Your
Honor please.»

But what he does allege, which is of great sig­

nificance, I think, is that this commission has embarked

upon

a course of conduct designed and purposed to destroy the labor
union to which he belongs by maligning it, by maligning its members, scandalizing them, by attempting to destroy this labor
union and discredit all of its members.
Now, I think Your Honors have recognized in your
10

1

several decisions that the right to belong to a labor union is

2

a constitutionally protected right under the First Amendment,

i'
3

Furthermore, I think you have held that the right to belong to

4

an association and the right to be free from defamation is also 1

5

a constitutionally protected right that one has.

6

To that extent, then, we show injury to a constitution­

7

ally protected right,

8

Q

9
10

j

It is the other way.

It is the right to defame

that is constitutionally protected,
A

I don't know that I interpret the decision of this

11

Court that way, but in the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee decision

12

of this Court, I think the Court expressly held --

13

Q

Did Mr. Jenkins hold any office in the union?

14

A

It is not alleged, but I think he did at one time.

15

Q

But it is not alleged.

16

A

No, sir; it is not alleged.

17

Q

Well, is his interest any greater than all of

18
19
20

the members of the union?
A

It is greater in the sense that he has been

directly attacked.

21

Q

Have others been attacked?

22

A

Yes, sir? very many of them.

Q

Well, then, how is his interest so great that it

23
24
25

gives him standing to attack this statute?
A

Because he has individually been attacked, Your

11

\

Honor.

Because his right to belong to a union has been im~

2

paired.

3

tion in his economic existence has been impaired and is threat­

4

ened to be destroyed.

5

Q

That is in this allegation?

6

A

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

7

Q

i

8

His right to have the collective security of associa­

Well, that is all right.
Q

10

12

17

22

A

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

Q

The complaint appears in the appendix, page 1

there, the interest or the impact of this plaintiff with respect
to the commission.

To resume a little more the line of inquiry of

20

Never mind.

you say this case was on the pleadings, as I understand you.

14

16

I will find it.

my brothers Marshall and Harlan, the complaint in this case —

13

15

Where is that, other than

generalities?

9

11

1 didn't see that.

A

We have a supplemental complaint, also.

Q

Maybe I missed it, and I certainly don’t want to

cause you to sit there and thumb through the brief and not find
it, but that is, at least for me, a rather important factor in
this case.
A

Paragraph 10 of the original complaint, the com­

23
plaint alleges that there is no factual or legal basis whatever

24
for the filing of such criminal charges against the complainant.

25
12

1

The complainant alleges that such criminal charges were filed

2

against him to inflict summary punishment upon your complainant

3

solely because he is a member of Teamsters Local Union No. 5.,

[

I

f

4
5
6
7

and et cetera from there.
Q

But those are criminal charges, initiated in the

ordinary way by the State of Louisiana.
A

No, sir? it is not in the ordinary way;: it is as

3

a result of the alleged conspiracy among the employees and repre

3

sentatives of this Labor-Management Commission of Inquiry, whom

10

it is alleged have singled out this particular union for repres­

11

sive action.

12

13

Furthermore, we allege in the supplemental petition
that they have singled out six officers of the union for murder.

14

C

For murders

15

A

Yes.

Then we have a supporting affidavit from

16

an undercover agent of the Labor-Management Commission of In­

17

quiry that we attach to the supplemental petition.

18

Q

Who were the members of this commission?

13

A

I can't recall them by name, Your Honor.

20

Q

Was the Dean of the Law School one of,them?

21

A

One Dean of the Law School, I think the chairman

22
23
24
25

was another Dean of a Law School.

There was a banker.

In fact<

the lower court commented on the fact that they were involved,
and the implication was that because of their position, it was
unlikely that they would engage in the conduct described in the
•a

1

complaint.

It would suggest that

1

Q

It is not an everyday occurrence, is it?

3

A

Well, of course, we speak also of vicarious

4

liability, if Your Honor please, because under Monroe versus

5

Pape, Your Honors have applied the civil rights statute vicar­

6

iously, or the liability of it vicariously, and we speak in that

7

context.

8

directly involved, but we have serious charges and I am satis­

9

fied that the plaintiff can substantiate these serious charges

to

with credible evidence in support of
Q

11

12

We didn’t necessarily speak that the officers were

them.

You don’t contend that your client’s own right

to be represented by counsel was violated here, do you?

13

A

I am sorry; I didn't understand, Your Honor.

14

Q

What constitutional rights of your client were

15

violated here?

16

examination?
A

17

His right to counsel?

His right to cross-

He was not called before this commission, and it

18

didn't become a past fact that he was denied this, but he is one

19

who has been singled out for this repressive action.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

What constitutional provision do you invoke here,

A

We invoke this constitutional provision:

then?
Because

of his material interest in this litigation, because this State
agency seeks to destroy his union and his membership in it and,
consequently, his right to economic security, and because they

14

1

ara daily defaming him, as such, in that capacity, he is being

2

denied a constitutionally secured right, and therefore, he has

3

been enabled to challenge the statute, and the challenge is

4

this, if Your Honor please —

5

Q

What?

6

A

The challenge is that this commission is author­

7

ized, Number 1, to function as an accusatory body? Number 2,

8

to accuse him, and anyone else, of being a public enemy»

9

to
11

Q

What is the constitutional right that is invaded

A

He is without the right to the assistance of

here?

12

counsel, without the right to examine or cross-examine witnesses

13

appearing before that commission, without, of course, the right

14

of having definable standards of guilt or innocence before they

15

pronounce him guilty of any offense, and without the right to

16

have the application of meaningful rules of evidence»

17

I think implicitly in the Hannah decision is a conclu­

18

sion by this Court, and certainly the Joint Anti-Fascist Commit­

19

tee, that no public body can defame an individual in this manner >

20

can destroy him, unless you accord to the individual the right

21

22

23
24
25

of confrontation, the right of cross-examination —*
Q

Well, the Grand Jury can indict somebody and neve c

have him .before it, or let him cross-examine witnesses»

Are you challenging the Grand Jury?

It is that there is

One is branded as a public

due process, there are no meaningful rules of evidence.

11

After ha is found guilty, as such, and that guilt is

12

publicized, and that finding forms part of a process of crimi­

13

nal prosecution, because the whole objective, the whole aim,

14

the whole purpose of the hearing is to bring about the criminal

15

prosecution of an individual after he has been found guilty of

16

the charge that ultimately is lodged against him.
Q

17

Suppose this investigation had been undertaken

18

by the Louisiana Legislature rather than this commission?

19

would your position be?
A

20

21

ence.

What

I don’t think it would make a substantial differ­

I think that any time —

22

Q

May I intervene?

I beg your pardon.

23

Suppose the Legislature said "We are conducting an

24

investigation not for lawmaking purposes, but for the purpose

25

of making a determination as to whether somebody has violated
16

i

1

the criminal law."

2

here, that this committee set up not merely to investigate, but

3

to make and publicise a determination as to criminal offense,

4

and then they report that.

5

that, doesn't it?

6

A

Isn't tha the gravamen of your complaint

In so many words, the statute says

I think the statute goes one step farther than

7

that, if Your Honor please.

It not only states that this is

8

what this commission is set up to do, to investigate whether or

9

not laws have been violated; but furthermore, this commission

10

must make a public finding.

It must make findings that directly

11

affect the rights of individuals.

12

Q

Naming persons.

13

A

Naming persons.

14

Q

Now, to get back to Justice Harlan's question,

15
16

17
10

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

suppose a legislative committee were set up for this precise
purpose; that is, to ascertain whether criminal laws have been
violated and to name specific persons for that purpose.

Do you

or do you not consider that that would be within the Legislature 1 s
constitutional prerogative?
A

I believe in that context, where there is no

purpose to gather evidence for the purpose of enacting legis­
lation of a remedial character, where the sole function is to

Yes, sir»

9
10
11

It is an inescapable,, mandatory duty.

They must publicise their findings, and all the evidence upon
which t&eir findings are based must, themselves, be public»
Q

I think this Court has rejected that argument in

12

connection with the Un-American Affairs Committee, where they

13

allege that they were being investigated in order to publicise

14

them and to bring them into humiliation and disgrace.

15

this Court has rejected that, over my protest.

16

A

I think

I think it has.

I think this goes one step further than that.

17

They actually have the power to say who is guilty and who is '

18

not guilty.

19

Q

Well, that was alleged in that case, that the

20

committee was to go out and pick up people and point out if they

21

were guilty, and publicize it, merely to publicise them and

22

bring them into disrepute and disgrace.

A

No, sir.

Well, in the preamble it is shown that

there was a shutdown of the industrial complex in Baton Rouge

5

there was an emergency created and this commission was created.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ARGUMENT OF ASHTON L. STEWART, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

8

MR. STEWARTs

9
10
11

Mr. Stewart?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The preamble of this statute provided that there had

12

been a shutdown in construction work in the vicinity of Baton

13

Rouge and that because of the great need for statev/ide investi­

14

gatory powers, which they did not have at the time, and to aid

15

and assist the District Attorneys and Grand Juries and law

16

enforcement officers, they enacted this legislation in order to

17

create this investigatory commission.

13

First off, it specifically provides that the commis­

19

sion should not make any adjudication as to the guilt or inno­

20

cence or as to any man's property rights, just as was held in

21

Hannah versus Larche.

22
23
24
25

Q

By "adjudication" do you mean assertions or do

you mean a legal adjudication?
A

A legal adjudication.

Q

In other words, they couldn't convict someone.
24

They could make findings.

1

A

No, sir .

2

Q

Were they limited in any way in their accusatory —

3

A

They had no authority to accuse anyone, just as

4

in the Civil Rights Commission, that commission had authority

5

to make findings, and so did this commission have the authority

Q

to make findings.
In addition to that, they went further and spelled out

7

8

the words that counselor plays on.

It says it "may include in

9

its findings general conclusions or particular inclusions as to

10

particular individuals."

I may not have the exact words, but

n

that was what it could include in its findings.

12

Q

Are they required to publish those findings?

13

A

Yes, sir.

The statute does say so, but, of

14

course, all public reports such as this report or the Civil Rights

15

Commission report would have been filed and publicised by being

IS

made public.

17
58

with the Legislature and the Governor, and, of course, that would
have made it publicized also.

25

This report of this commission was to be filed

What is the object in publicizing them, if not

to punish them or to hold them up to public humiliation and
disgrace?
A

The only object I could understand from the

statute, if it please the Court, is that they especially wanted
everything in the public eye with reference to this.

It em­

broiled the community in such a tremendous manner that they
25

1

wanted everything out in the open and public.

2

reason they required all the hearings to be heard in public.

3

Q

That is the

As a matter of fact, all civil matters in the

4

labor-raanagemenfc field are expressly excluded from the jurisdic­

5

tion of this commission, are they not?

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

And the commission's jurisdiction is limited only

8

to violations of the criminal law in the field of labor-manage­

9

ment relations, is that right?

10

A

Yes,

sir.

11

Q

Withthe express exclusion of civil matters.

A

hearings

14

and make a public report, identifying individuals, and making

15

findings that they have violated the criminal laws of Louisiana

1G

or the United States; is that right?

17

A

They were supposed to make findings, and the Act

18

provided that they may include in those findings particular

19

individuals.

20

Q

Only on violations of the criminal law.

21

A

Yes.

22

Q

And if they come across any labor-management

23

problem which is not a violation of criminal law, they are sup­

24

posed to exclude it from the scope of their operations.

25

A

Yes.

That is exactly so.

26

Is that the same as the Civil Rights Commission?

i

Q

2

A

3

Well., I wouldn't want to answer that right off, but

Yes, sir»

4

the Civil Rights Commission statute does provide that they make

5

findings, and I am reading from 1975 —

6

7
Q

Q

But is it limited in its jurisdiction to nothing

but criminal cases?
A

Yes.

The Civil Rights Commission is limited to

3

voting denials and in that respect they are similar? yes, sir.

10

It is investigation, and in Hannah versus Larche there was the

11

same contention made, that they would publicize and hold these

12

people up to scorn because of having committed some crime with

13

reference to the voting thing, and that is the same identical

14

argument being made here.

15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

Q

You are not saying, are you, that the Civil

Rights Commission involved in Hannah versus Larche was supposed
to confine itself to violations of the criminal law?
A

No, sir? I didn't attempt to say so.

Q

I didn't think you said that,

A

No, sir? if I did, I am sorry.

Q

As I understand it, what you have is a State

proceeding in which you have no judge, no court, to call wit­
nesses in to examine to see if you can find particular indivi­
duals who have been guilty of a crime, and then the duty to
publish it, so the public will know about it.
27

Is that what it : s?

1

Is it not that?

Q

Charging people with being guilty of a crime.

Are they entitled to an attorney?
A

Yes# sir.

Under the statute, they are entitled

to# just as in the Civil Rights Commission# be accompanied by

15

an attorney# but he is not given the right to cross-examine the

16

other witnesses without —

17
10

Q

You cannot cross-examine any witnesses.

It is nc t

anything like a court proceeding.

19

A

No.

20

Q

Well# Mr. Stewart# as I understand it# they hold

21

these hearings and they air everything in public# and then they

22

find that they have violated (a)# or several criminal laws of

23

the State of Louisiana.

24

A

Yes# sir.

25

Q

That is right?
28

1

A

Yes, sir»

2

Q

And then they refer it to a trial court, the

3

prosecutor? right?

4

A

There is an authority of prosecution? yes? sir.

5

Q

What is the purpose of sending it to the court

6

when you have already found them guilty?
A

7

8

Well; this commission cannot do anything to de­

prive him of any of his rights.

9

Q

Except to find him guilty without a trial.

10

A

The same way with a Grand Jury? yes, sir.

that what they do?

12

Well, if we have a situation, as we have here,

with these conditions going on, and the jurisdiction of the

14

District Attorneys and Grand Juries limited to parish limits,

15

they needed something because this industrial complex encompasse d

16

far more than one or two parishes.

17

were they to do?

20
21

The public, of course, could judge very well if someone was
doing something unfairly.

23

25

I think that was one of the salutory

features of the statute; that it was public and not private.

22

24

What

They certainly publicized by making everything public.

13
19

They needed some help.

How is the commission selected?

are identical with the Civil Rights Commission.

said the procedures were drafted with the Civil Rights Commis­

Would it be relevant as to why the two Deans

retired from the commission?
A

No, sir; I do not

think so.

My understanding is

that Dean Morgan was already retired from another position, and

he wanted some peace.

He doesn't allege that he was an object of the

There is nothing in the record about it?

A

Well, I won't say that.

Mo, sir.

He has said that the

Labor-Management Commission, in conspiracy with the District

5

Attorney, filed these charges against him.

6

out of that that that was the commission's doing, that is some­

7

thing else, but that is the only allegation —

Now, if you can eke

Was there any allegation in the record, or any­

thing to reveal whether or not any witnesses were called to
testify against him?

11

A

No, sir; there is nothing to that effect here.

12

Q

No indication in the record that, he was the

13

object of any commission hearing?

14

A

Nothing in the record.

15

Q

Or the object of any findings by the commission?

16

A

Nothing in the record.

He is a stranger to these

7

proceedings, and if the Court were to grant the injunction, it

13

would not help him in accordance with the record.

He says he is a member of the union, and the con­

other charges such as someone being arrested by an arrest war­

that he has any causal connection with the administration of the

statute.

It is some connection.;, isn't it* if he is a

member of a union and he alleges a conspiracy to destroy the

union of which he is a member?

I would think that my recollection — that is

not in the record, but my recollection is that one of the big
problems was the jurisdictional problem between the electricians
and the teamsters* and he was a member of one of those unions?

He is a member of the Teamsters»

Yes* sir? the Teamsters.

There is some connection.

Yes* sir? on that basis.

On the question of whether he has been complained

I notice on page 7 of the transcript it says, "Furthermore, com-'

13

Caseo, while acting in concert with defendants herein, and acting

under cover of law while functioning as District Attorney, filed

in the 18th Judicial Circuit," and then he goes on to recite two

16

charges of assault with a deadly weapon against him.

17

So he does actually charge that they have engaged

10

unlawfully in law enforcement actions against him under the powejrs

19

of this commission, doesn't he?

Ho, sir,

My understanding is that the commis­
