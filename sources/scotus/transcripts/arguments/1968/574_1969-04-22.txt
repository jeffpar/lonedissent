Mr. Solicitor General.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, this is an estate tax case which comes here from
the Court of Claims.
Before startinq to discuss the merits of the case, I

12

would point out that the Respondent has raised a question of

13

jurisdiction of the Court and it is discussed in the reply

14

memorandum which we filed in connection with our petition for

15

certiorari, and I want to discuss it now very briefly, only

16

to make it plain that I do not think there is appropriately a

17

13

jurisdictional question here.
It starts out, I think in the way it starts out can

19

best be seen by looking first at page 123 of the record, where

20

the Court of Claims on April 18 said, "Upon the foregoing

21

findings of fact which are made a part of the judgment herein,

22

the Court concludes as a matter of law that the

23

are entitled to recover and judgment is entered to that effect.

24
25

plaintiffs

The amount of recovery will be determined pursuant to Rule 47(c)
And I would also point out there is on page 2 of the
2

?!

1

record a pasted in correction of the record because the

2

respondents felt that the record as it had been submitted was

o

not accurate, and that shows April 19,

4

with the amount of recovery to be determined by further pro­

5

ceedings „ "

'‘Judgment for plaintiff

And then there was a stipulation and the final order

6
7

of the court appears at page 125 of the record.

3

therefore, ordered that judgment be and the same is entered

3

for the plaintiffs in the sum of $419,221.05, together with

10

interest thereon from July 14, 1954, as provided by lav/."
And that was entered on June 23.

The Government's

petition for certiorari was filed on September 26, which was
within 90 days.

We believe that this question has been several

times passed upon by this court and perhaps most clearly and
effectively in connection with the case of United States
against Bianke and Company, where there is nothing in the
opinion, but where substantially the same question was raised
in opposition to the Government's petition.
The Government responded on the jurisdictional

19

20

"It is,

ground.

The Court granted the petition and decided the case

on the merits.
Now with respect to the merits of this case, it is
a question of the taxability of one of two reciprocal trusts
created by husband and wife within 15 days of each other at the

24

close of 1931.
25

1

The question involving reciprocal trusts was one

2

which most people regarded as settled nearly 30

years ago by

3

an opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Lehman

4

against the Commissioner, an opinion by Judge Patterson which

5

was concurred in by Judge Lerned Hand Judge Chase.

6

A petition for certiorari was filed and this Court

7

denied certiorari and the status of things as followed after

8

that case is I think exemplified by the title of an article

9

which was cited in our brief and was published in 1948, Colgan

10

and Molloy, Converse Trusts--The Rise and Fall of a Tax

11

Avoidance Device.

I think it was Lord MacNaughton who said that it is
one thing to put Shelley's case in a nutshell, and another
thing to keep it there.

And this case illustrates the fact

that it is one thing to get an

estate tax decided and another

thing to keep it decided.
What then are the facts of this case?

The case as

I have said comes from the Court of Claims and the findings
of fact of the Court of Claims begin at page 87 of the record.
They show in substance and effect that Joseph P. Grace and
Janet Grace were husband and wife, that they lived happily
together, that the husband was quite wealthy and frequently made
gifts to his wife, from time to time asked her to return property
which he had given to her which she always did, and on page 88
of the record we have a finding (5).
4

1

The decedent exercised supervision and control over

2

and he made the decisions that were involved in the management

3

of the business affairs of the family.

4

sentence in that paragraph, "When the decedent decided that

3

some formal action by Janet

G

with the management or disposition of a piece of property or

?

a financial interest that was in her ownership, the decedent

3

customarily would have the appropriate instrument prepared for

9

his wife's signature and would then have her execute such

10

And then the last

Grace was required in connection

instrument."
In the latter part of 1931, Mr. Grace became con­

11
12

cerned.

13

to him of ways to minimise taxes, at least gift taxes which

14

he thought would become effective in 1932, as they did in fact

13

become effective.

16

There was some indication that there were suggestions

And on December 15, 1931, Mr. Grace created a trust,

17

the essential terms of which are set forth on pages 92 to 94

13

of the record in the court's findings.

19

They provided that certain property was transferred

20

to trustees upon trust for his wife for life, with remainder

21

as she might by will appoint with power in the trustees to

22
23
24

25

convey the principal to her and with gifts in default of
appointment to his heirs.
And then the findings show on page 98 to 100, that
15 days later on December 30, 1931, Mrs. Grace executed a
5

1

trust instrument which was essentially identical except re­

2

ciprocal; that isf it was a trust by which she transferred

3

certain property, including the family residence, to trustees

4

upon trust for her husband for life, with power in the trustees

3

to convey the principal to him with remainder subject to his

S

appointment and gift in default of appointment to her heirs.
Mrs. Grace died in the 1930!s; Mr. Grace lived until

7

8

1951.

When Mr. Grace died, the Government contended pursuant

9

to the Lehman case that the trust which she had created was

10

one which should be included in his gross estate as a trust in

11

which he had reserved a life estate.

were filed.

Claims for a refund

When they were not acted on within the six months,

this suit was brought in theCourt of Claims.
The difficulty arises, I think, largely from the
fact that in the Lehman case four trusts were created by two
brothers, two each for the other, as a result of an agreement
between them.
There is as a consequence some talk in the Lehman
opinion to the effect that one trust was created in consideration
of the other.
There is more talk as appears in page 27 of the
respondent's brief where there is an extensive quotation from
the Lehman opinion.

There is more talk of how the decedent
6

1

by transfer of his share to his brother,, caused the brother

2

to make a transfer of property in trust.

IS

And could there be a clearer case than this one that
the decedent caused his wife Janet to make this transfer.

He

drew up the instrument, he made the plan, the Court of Claims
has found the final finding on page 122 and 123 of the record,
the Joseph Grace trust and the Janet Grace trust were created
by or at the instigation of Joseph P. Grace as parts of what
was essentially a single transaction.
Q

Was the property, Mr. Solicitor General, that

the subject of her trust, her own property?
A

It was at that time her own property.

It had

come I think in large part of entirely originally from him.
Q

Does anything turn on that?

A

I do not believe so, Mr. Justice.

Perhaps

something could have been made to turn on it at an earlier
stage in the case, but no contention has: been made that this

17
was anything other than her property which she transferred in
13
19

trust for him in connection with or almost contemporaneously
with a transfer of property which he made in trust for her.

20
Now the court below seized on this concept of con­
21

sideration as some of the other courts have following the

22
Lehman case and the respondent bases his whole cirgument upon it.
23

If I am caught by the consideration argument my
24

path may be somewhat more difficult, though I do not think that
25

7

1

even then it is hopeless for consideration must be interpreted

2

in the light of the actual facts of the case.
But I don't think the question in this case ought to

3
4

be made to turn on any questions of whether there is con­

5

sideration in the contract sense.

S

bargaining here.

8

related question as referred to as trading harangues.

9

12

15

spouses do not, short of a divorce settlement, and there there
was never a divorce and no property settlement of that kind.
As the Court of Claims has found, these two trusts
were created as part of a single plan which was devised and
actuated by Mr. Grace.
In the Court of Claims there is a dissenting opinion

16
17
18

by Judge Davis who deals extensively with this problem.

21

He

uses a good many other words.
Page 75 of the record, interconnected," page 76,

19

20

This

These spouses did not operate on that basis as most

13
14

There was nothing of what the Fifth Circuit

was a question of mutual gifts, not of bargain, at arms length.

10
11

Of course, there was no

mutuality.

And farther down on the page, related, connected

and interdependent.

Page 78, he refers to — well it is on

page 80 — he refers to cross trusts are seen as interdependent.
Page 84 he refers to the true reciprocity and interdependence
and says

that if the cross trust arrancement was mutual and

interdependent, there is such a transfer.
8

And on page 85 he

1

refers to the crossing was not haphazard, but part of a single

2

interdependent transaction.
Reciprocal trusts are in fact outside the direct

3
4

language of the statute.

But the court in the Lehman case

5

and in many other cases has uncrossed the trusts, relying on

S

the fundamental rule repeatedly reaffirmed by this court, the

7

tax consequences flow from the economic substance and effect

3

of a transaction, and not its form.
I
This is rather like a converse of the Gregory situa­

9
10

tion.

There the transaction came within the literal language

11

of the statute, but this court held that what was done was a

12

mere device, not within the substance or the purpose of the

13

statute.
This recalls other expressions of this court at this

14
15

1G
17
18

period, in Burnet and Wells the court through Mr. Justice
Cardozo referred to the record of the Government's endeavor
to keep pace with the fertility of invention whereby taxpayers
had contrived to keep the larger benefits of ownership and be
.

19

20

21
22
23
24
25

relieved from the attendant burdens, and shortly thereafter
in Griffith against Commissioner the court referred to a lawyer'(b
ingenuity devised a technically elegant arrangement whereby
an intricate outward appearance was given in that case to make
the thing look to be a sale rather than the payment of a
dividend.
Our submission is that the existence of consideration
>

9

2

the existence of a bargain for quid pro quo is not the touch

2

stone of the Lehman case, but it is simply a question of whether

uJ

o

there are mutual gifts, whether the consequence of the transaction

4

as it was carried out is essentially the same as it would be

5

if Mr. Grace had created a trust for himself and Mrs. Grace

6

had created a trust for herself.
And this construction of the reciprocal trust situa­

7

8

tion has been confirmed by Congress.

9

Changes Act of 1949, following this court’s decision in the

10

This was in the Technical

Church and Spiegel cases.

11

.

Congress then provided for tax free release of

12

powers reserved in reciprocal trust, of powers reserved in

13

reciprocal trust, effective until December 31, 1950.

14

a little over a year after the statute was passed.
This did not provide for tax-free release of retained

15
15
17
10

19

life estates or reciprocal life estates, unless the trust
had been irrecoverably established before March 3, 1931, and
that would not apply in this case because the trusts were
established in December of 1931.
In connection with this 1949 statute, the committee

That was

reports are explicit.

The Senate report which is essentially

the same as the House report is set out on page 23 of our
brief, "Prior to 1940" the Senate report says, "certain re­
ciprocal trusts were established with fch® apparent intent of
minimizing estate taxes by what were then considered effective
means."

10

I
!

1

And going to the end of that paragraph, "By this

2.

reciprocal device it was thought that two persons could

o

O

transfer property to their heirs without diminishing effective

4

control during life but still paying the gift tax rather than

5

the estate tax.”
'

6

And then the last paragraph on that page, "However,

7

in 1940, in Lehman against Commissioner, the Circuit Court of

8

Appeals for the Second Circuit, held that where trusts are

9

found to have been created each in consideration of the other,

10

And the Congress went, on to provide that there should

12

be a limited period when persons who in a sense had been

13

caught by that could release powers, but made

14

for releasing life estates or transferring life estates in

15

reciprocal trusts unless the life estate had been created before;

10

March 3, 1931, which was the date of the statute which Congress

17

passed explicitly making taxable the reservation of a life

13

estate.

There is the simple factual statement, "An individual

might establish a trust at the same time or short time after the
husband set up the trust his wife would also establish a trust,'1

accomplished.

created is the one w7hich is included in his estate.

with the plan of the decedent, and were parts of what was

On this record it is plain that these trusts were

11

12

intimately connected in their inception and that is enough to

13

invoke the rule of the Lehman case as Congress as confirmed.

We submit that the judgment of the Court of Claims

18

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. DOWNArd;

Mr,, Downard.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.

I

‘"
Section 811(c)(1)(b)

of the 1939 Internal Revenue

Code under which the Government seeks to impose a tax in this
case, authorizes inclusion in the taxable estate of a decedent

[

of property, and I believe that the language of the statute is
important in imposing a tax when it describes a transaction to
13

|i

1

which the tax applies.
It says to the property to the extent of any interest

2
3

therein of which the decedent has made a transfer under which

4

he has retained a life estate.
Now this law clearly permits and has always been

5
6

held to permit any husband to place property in trust for his

7

wife for life, with the remainder to their children and that

8

trust would not be subject to

9

wife because she only had a life estate in it.
And it was not a retained life estate.

10

The same is true of any wife.

11
12
13
14
15

18
19

20
21

22

There is certainly no

discrimination on account of sex in this statute.

Any wife

may create a trust for the benefit of her husband for life with
:he remainder to their children, and that triist is not taxable
on the death of the life tenant.
Now here the Government is trying to tax a trust on

16
17

estate tax on the death of the

the death of the life tenant to the life tenant's estate.

It

tries to justify that position by reliance on the Lehman case
and the many other cases following it.

And yet in the Lehman

case which involved a clear case of this economic equivalence
of the two trusts where two brothers that each had a half
interest in certain securities, each transferred their half
interest purportedly in trust for the other brother and his

23
24

children.
And there was no way to tell which half interest went

25

14

1

2
3

into which trust except that the papers said so.
Q

What extent was their economic equivalence here?

As to the sise of the corpus?

5

your Honor,

Q

facts of this case and hoi* they will not tally with the

7

Government's argument that substance must prevail over form.

10

11

I think that is the critical thing in this case,
There was none,

Wow let us go into the actual

That is what we are asking the Court to do is to let
substance prevail over form in the substance of these trusts
was quite different.
Wow the property that the wife transferred to the

12

trust that the Government now seeks to include in the decedent's;

13

estate consisted of the family homestead, which was a large

14

167 acre estate on Long Island, that had a big expensive 65

15

room mansion on it.

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

That property had originally been given to the wife
back in 1911, and she had owned it for 20 years before she
created this trust with it.
In that trust with the homestead property she placed
40 shares of stock in a personal holding company which were
calculated to be the amount of stock necessary to produce
enough dividends to pay the local ad valorem taxes on the
homestead property, just as support for the homestead.
So essentially the nature of that trust that the wife
created and that the Government now seeks to tax to the

15

1

decedent's estate was a purely noncommercial interest in a

2

homestead and by virtue of the creation of that trust the Court

3

of Claims found that there was no change whatever in the

4

possession, use or enjoyment of the property, so that there

5

was — and that none was intended, and in fact as noted in the

Q

Government's brief in a footnote, the decedent did immediately

7

after the creation of this wife's trust, exercise a power of

8

appointment that he had to appoint it back to her for her life.
And specifically provided that she would then have

10

the successive life estate in case he predeceased her.

a thousand acre tract of land out in a remote section of Long

pieces of real estate.
Most of these properties had been inherited by the

But he transferred to that estate commercial invest- j

ment properties that had a financial significance.

And

certainly as a result of the creation by his wife of this
16

trust, placing the homestead in trust as a device for pre­

2

serving it and maintaining it for the family and their children,

3

the decedent didn't get any sort of economic equivalence.

As far as any real substance and effect is concerned,

the Janet Grace trust accomplished nothing that could not have

11

been accomplished had she provided a testamentary life estate

this decedent, because he was a very trust-minded man, because
he had created 26 trusts for his children in the ten years
before this, and he was convinced that trusts were a good way
fca do things, he happened to select this way of doing it, this
trust instrument and it just happened that because he was
creating this other financial trust for the security of his
wife and children at the same time, he used the same form of
trust instrument, but the similarity in forms of the trust
instrument is purely a superficial matter of form.

It seems to me paradoxical that the Solicitor General

2

argues that substance must prevail over form and that we must

give recognition to the economic substance without ever facing

4

up to the fact of what the economic substance of these trusts

5

really are.
And in any real sense of economic substance, there

Finish your sentence.

When her estate was under examination

taxed Joseph Grace's trust to Janet Grace’s estate.

It didn't

do that.
They compromised.

They entered into a compromise

agreement whereby 55 percent of the Janet Grace trust was
included in Janet's estate, and in this case they are trying
18

1

to include it again in Joseph's estate and impose two estate

taxes on the same trust and no case has ever held that the

reciprocal trust doctrine should result in double taxation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. DOWNARD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MR. DOWNARD;

9

Mr. Downard, you may

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please tha Court.
I want to digress a moment before

10

continuing my

11

argument on the merits of the case to take up the point men­

12

tioned by the Solicitor General on the serious question of

13

jurisdiction.
We strongly believe that this petition was out of

tang.

It was filed on the 160th day after this decision was

printed and announced by the Court of Claims, formerly a §5-pageij
document which contains as the Solicitor General read to you,
the statement that the findings of fact which are made a part
of the judgment herein.
The basic court conclusion that the plaintiffs are
entitled to recover, and states judgment is entered to that
effect and a docket entry was made that judgment was entered
on that day, the findings of fact which are incorporated ex­
pressly in the judgment state the amounts and date from which
interest runs, everything necessary to determine the Amount.
20

There had never been any question as to the amount

and it was recently stipulated and a subsequent one-page type­

3

written ordered entered that merely confirmed the amount as

the time runs for filing a petition, according to all of the

standards set forth in this court's cases, such as Minneapolis

8

Honeywell, and the Shafer Brewing case, and the last case I

9

believe which the court has addressed itself specifically to

10

a Court of Claims' case of this sort was the Adams case cited
in the Government's brief in response»

12

That case clearly indicated a second judgment, unless

3

it were inextricably linked with the issue dealt with in the

4

first judgment, that sought to be reviewed, is not the measuring

5

time from which the time for filing the petition begins.

25

Well, after that digression, let me get back to the
merits of the case.
The Solicitor General has presented the Court with
the paradox that while he concedes that consideration must be
interpreted in the light of the actual facts of the case, he
has not come to grips with the actual facts of the case as
found by the Court of Claims.
Instead, referring only to certain language out of the
d issenting opinion, the dissenting judge simply did not agree
with the facts as found by the Court and the Court did find
2

1

the facts and the facts as found hj the Court should be accepted

2

as the facts of this case»

3

Those facts, pertinent to the question of whether

4

these trusts were created in consideration of each other which

5

has always been the test, are as follows:

6

purely subjective facts»

7

And they are not

There are objective facts set forth in detail in the

8

record, detailing a long history of gifts by this decedent

9

of large and valuable property, not inconsequential gifts.

10

They were properties worth considerable sums of

11

money, that he had given to his wife.

12

such gifts either to his wife or in trust to his children, in

13

every year over a 25“year period, from 1917 through 1942, with

14

the exception of 1921, and except for the few years immediately

15

after the creation of these trusts in December of 1931, he

16

didn't create any trusts.

17
10
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

He had made one or more

The obvious reason being that in this December 1931
trust as shown by the evidence and found by the court, he was
anticipating the enactment of a gift tax law in 1932.

There

was no gift tax at that time, and a gift tax law was indeed
enacted in 1932.
And the only stated reason for the decedent's acting
at this particular time was the fact that he heard a gift tax
law was going to be enacted and he said anything further I am
going to do, in my program of giving, 1 should do before the

1

gift tax comes in because if I postpone it I will have to pay

2

a gift tax»

3

that is not an evil tax avoidance motive»

4

of common sense saying I have been giving away property all

5

ray life and this is my means of expressing my affection for my

S

dependent loved ones and if I postpone it I will have to pay

7

additional taxes, so why wait»

8
9

If I go ahead and do if now I won9t have to, and
It is just as a man

So he was anxious to go ahead and do it and this is
the full explanation of the reason why these two trusts

10

happened to have been created at the same time* because he was

11

anxious to get things done before this gift tax came in»

12

Certainly if these two transactions had been done

13

with different forms as easily they could have been, or if

14

they had been done at different times,, if the decedent had

13
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

carried out his program of giving in his usual manner and gi\yen
away one of these properties in 1931, and another one in 1932,
and another one in 1933, and another one in 1934, and so forth,
and if Janet Grace at any other time had placed her homestead
in trust to preserve and maintain it for her family and
children, nobody would

say these trusts are reciprocal»
..

It is purely the superficial appearance created by
the timing that gives the Government any argument that these
trusts have any appearance

similar to those that have been

held reciprocal in any cases»
And that factor of timing is fully explained by the
23

1

2

decedent8s anticipation of the gift tax law.
Certainly that fact that his concern about the gift

3

tax law was his prime worry at the time merely serves to

4

emphasise that these trusts were really donative in nature

5

and he certainly considered that he was making a gift or he

6

wouldn't have been worried about the gift tax,

7

8

If he thought that he were making some exchange for
considerations with his wife, but the Court has expressly
l

9

tried this case through a long trial and very comprehensive

10

record and analysis of the facts and the trier of the facts has

11

to determine that these were gratuitous gifts that were made.

12

The Solicitor General has indicated that consideration
f

13

should not be the test in this case.

14

based on cases such as the Lehman case that is expressly based

15

on consideration.

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And yet, his argument is

In the Lehman case it was certainly one in which the
Court could have completely omitted the consideration test and
just said the economic substance of these transactions is the
same as if each brother had created a trust for himself, but
it didn't stop there.
The Lehman case went on to say and to point out that
this was not a significant point and said that the decisive
point in this case is that by transferring his own property to
hi3 brother, he caused his brother to make the other trust for
his benefit.
24

And then it went on to talk about consideration and

1

2

quid pro quo.
■

3

Now, the Solicitor General has picked up only one

4

phrase out of that sentence and said, "In the Lehman case one

5

brother caused the other brother to make the trust."

S

But it wasn't the fact that he caused him to make the

7

trust by asking him to, requesting him to, suggesting that he

3

do it or advising that he do it or planning the trust instru­

9

ments, the case specifically said that by transferring his own

10
11

property he caused it.
And then in the Hanauer case, in the Second Circuit

12

which followed on the Lehman case, the Second Circuit explained

13

and reiterated that it was the furnishing of a consideration

14

or a quid pro quo whereby transferring his own property the

15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

decedent had caused the other transfer to be made.
And so the consideration test is a causation test,
but it is a causation test based on whether one transfer of
property causes another transfer of property.

It is not a

question of whether one person such as a husband, causes a
donor to make a gift to him by requesting it.
A donor is nonetheless a donor and a donee is nonethe­
less a donee, sim.ply because the donee requests, suggests,
advises, recommends, wheedles or cajoles; if a son asks his
father to give him a piece of property because he wants it, if
the father gives it to him it is still a gift.
25

1

If a husband asks his wife or plans and arranges for

2

his wife to give him a piece of property and puts the deed in

3

front of her, she owns the property and it is only she that

4

has the right to say, "Wo, I won't give it," or "Yes, I will,"

5

and all she has to do to make a transfer in terms of the estate

S

tax and the gift tax is to sign that deed»

7

And that is what Janet Grace did.

8

You may draw an analoay to the community property

12

interest in it, and that half interest passes to somebody else,

13

even without her knowledge and consent, it is held that she made

14

a taxable gift for gift tax purposes, for

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

tax purpose

nothing to say about it and so the Government's argument athat
the wife, because the wife was merely compliant or acquiescent
to her hxisband's wishes, somehow means that she didn't make
a transfer of her property to this trust, seems aside from the
point and contrary to the whole established concepts of estate
and gift taxes.

And the Court was interested in that and said well

now, if these were a tax avoidance device that may affect our

disposition of the case so they remanded it for a further trial

19

on the issue of whether the decedent was motivated to avoid or

20

lessen estate taxes with reference to creation of these trusts.

21

And another full trial was had.

22

The conclusion of fact was reached that there was

23

no motive to avoid gift taxes in this — there was no motive

24

to avoid estate taxes in this case, and that there was no

25

showing of any motive of any tax avoidance of any kind.

27

1

And the evidence clearly supported that for the

2

decedent created these trusts in a routine and cavalier fashion/

3

done very hurriedly in December of 1931, not considered

4

a long time and never consulted any tax attorney, any tax

5

advisor of any kind with reference to the tax consequences of

S

these large trusts that he was creating, which is almost

7

inconceivable that a man would create trusts of this size

8

without consulting a tax advisor, but he did because he wasn’t

9

:oncerned about taxes.

10

for

He was concerned about providing for his dependent

11

loved ones as he had been doing all his life.

And the Court,

12

of Claims found as a fact that these trusts were merely part

13

of this long pattern in history of gifts, that these parties

14

had been making.

17
10
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now, on the question of what the law is in this case,
the Solicitor General read to the Court excerpts from the
Committee reports, including the following:
"However, in 1940, in Lehman against Commissioner, the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that where
trusts are found to have been created each in consideration of
the other, the nominal grantors would be interchanged."
i

And then he said right after that, that there is
no reference to consideration in the committee reports.

And I

ask you to again read the language that ha read to the court
which specifically does mention where the trusts are found to
28

1

have been created in consideration of each other, so Congress

2

was confronted, vras fully apprised of and recognized the

3

existence of the consideration requirement as set forth in

4

Lehman andthe cases following it»

5

It chose not to legislate any different rule and,

6

therefore, accepted that rule, and certainly the Lehman rule

7

that the Congress expressly approved of in the 1949 committee

8

reports, when it chose not to do anything but grant some relief

9

legislation was the very test that the Court of Claims used in

10

the decision below and that is, as stated by the Eighth Circuit

11

in the Moreno case, perhaps one of the most recent cases on

12

the subject, that whether this doctrine applies is simply a

13

question of fact, whether one trust was created in consideration

14

for the other trusts.

15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And where trusts have been found not to have been
created in consideration of each other, factually, the courts
have held in case after case that the trusts are not taxable
reciprocal in the absence of consideration.
In case after case which have held trust taxable
reciprocably, the courts have clearly set forth the rule and
discussed the matter as a factual test of whether these trusts
were created in consideration of each other.
Now that is what all of the previous cases have held.
But even meeting the Solicitor General on his own
battleground and saying there is no consideration test, despite
29

J

I

what all the cases have said, despite what Congress said,

2

let us assume there is no consideration test and that we con­

3

front this matter merely as a question of whether the economic

4

substance and effect is the same, whether the consequences

5

are the same as the Solicitor General said, is if Mr. and Mrs.

6

Grace each created a trust for himself, and when you confront

7

the realities and the facts of this case you find that those

0

economic consequences were not the same and could not be the

9
10

tl
12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

same because of the nonequivalence in the whole nature of the
two different trusts.
Now, let me call attention to one further thing.

In

even approaching the form of these transactions as the Solicitor
General does, that in form even these trusts were not reciprocal
and nonreciprocating in their taxable incidents, for in each
trust the settlor named himself as trustee and retained a
taxable power to terminate the trust by distributing it to the
life tenant at any time.
These parties did not carry out the reciprocal trust
arrangement of giving taxable powers to each other.

Rather

each one kept a clearly taxable power for himself and under
this court's decision in Lober and Holmes cases cited in our
brief, those trusts would be taxable each to the settlor who

22
created it.
23
And Janet Grace's trust should have been taxed to
24
Janet's estate.

We admit that.

25
30

It was taxed to her estate

1

and now the Government is trying to tax it again.
The Joseph Grace trust would have been taxed to his

2

3

estate* except that that trust terminated and passed irrevo­

4

cably and outright to his children in

5

and the only reason he is not taxable on the property that went

into that trust is that it vested in the children ipassed

ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

12

3

937,

937 when his wife died

MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court.

There is one point which I would like to clarify,
and that is the suggestion that the Janet Grace trust is being
taxed twice.
I think it also bears on the argument of consideratior
and rather shows that when you are dealing with mutual gifts
the question of the meaning of consideration can be clarified
by thinking of it in terms of value.
It is the Treasury's practice in the case of mutual
gifts to say that they are reciprocal or crossed to the extent
of mutual value.
And if one of the trusts is bigger than the other,
then the excess is treated as a gift, independent of the other.
31

1

Now what happened here was that when Mrs. Grace died, the ques­

2

tion was, what should be included in her estate.

3

that what was included in her estate was the Joseph Grace trust,

4

but to the extent of the mutual value.

And I think

5

As the Janet Grace trust was the smaller trust, the

6

mutual value was determined by finding the value of the Janet

7

Grace trust.

8

trust which is measured in value by the Janet Grace trust which

was included in Mrs. Grace's estate.

And thus it was that part of the Joseph Grace

12

55 percem. of the value, but the significant thing I think is

13
14
15
16
17

18

that it is mutual value, it is analogous to consideration in a
case like the Lehman case, it is appropriate to talk about the
consideration; it is, of course, quite true that the committee
report which I read uses the word consideration, but there
still remains the question of construing or interpreting what
that means.
I do not think it means a bargained for item, some­
