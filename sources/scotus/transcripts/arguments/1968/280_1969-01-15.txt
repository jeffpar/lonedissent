ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This is a Federal tax case here on a writ of

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

7

As I was saying before the recess,

8

this case involves two payments, aggregating $505,000, made by

9

the Respondent in 1958, which represented repayments of excess

10

charges for gas which it had sold in the years 1352 to 1957,

11

for which it had received payment and against which payments it

12

had deducted the statutory precentage depletion in the amount

13

of 27-1/2 percent.

14

-

The taxpayer's contention is it is entitled to deduct

15

the entire amount of the repayments made in 1958, despite the

16

fact that depletion had already been deducted with respect to

17

them.

18

There is some discussion in the briefs as to whether

19

this deduction is under the deduction for a loss or the

20

deduction for business expense.

21

that the Government has changed its ground on that.

22

think that that is the case.

23

page 18, the last line on the page, of the Appendix, simply

24

says that they took a deduction.

25

There is a suggestion made
I do not

The stipulation in the matter, at

But I spend no time on this, because I do not think
5

m

i

it is important or of any consequence,, in any event.

2

The District Court agreed with the Government’s

3

argument and entered judgment for the Government, based on the

4

position that the deduction for 1958 would be reduced by the

5

amount of the percentage depletion which had already been

6

allowed as a deduction with respect to the payments.
On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit

9

rehearing, but after the rehearing the Court adhered to its

It then granted the Government’s petition for

10

earlier decision by a 2-to-l vote, Judge Hill writing an

n

extensive dissenting opinion.

12

Now, with respect to the law, I think that it can

13

fairly be said that what is really involved here is basic

14

questions of proper tax accounting, and it was because of the

15

undesirability of having clear principles already established

16

by this court made confusing that we felt it was important

17

to seek a review here.

18

19
20

The case involves Section 1341 of the Internal
Revenue Code, and I will turn to that in a moment,
I think it fair to say, though, that even though

21

Section 1341 must be considered, the proper conclusion is that

22

on consideration one could come to the conclusion that

23

Section 1341 is in fact bypassed in this case and that the

24

case should be decided exactly as it would be decided if

25

Section 1341 had never been enacted.
6

Now, the relevant portion of Section 1341 is set out

«
i

>

2

on pages 10 and 11 of our brief»

It is also in the Appendixes

3

to both briefs and elsewhere.

4

Government’s brief we find that it starts out with "If-—and

5

then there are five numbered paragraphs.

6

conditions to the application of the section,

Looking at page 10 of the

The first three are

7

I would point out that paragraphs (1) sayss

8

59If an item" — and I would call attention to those

9
10
11

12

13

words, t3an item” — ”was included in gx'oss income for a prior
taxable year (or years) because it appeared that the taypayer
had an unrestricted right to such item” — now, that is the
payments which the Respondent received in the years 952 to
J57 —
M(2) a deduction” *— now, I call your attention to the

14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

fact that that is not the same word.

It is a different word.

It does not follow that the deduction is in the same amount as
the item.

The deduction is whatever is the appropriate amount

of the deduction, in the light of the fact that an item was
received ~ 85a deduction is allowable for the taxable year
because it was established after the close of such prior taxable
year {or years) that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted
right to such item or to a portion of such item” — and that
condition is met here —
And ”(3) the amount of such deduction exceeds
$3,000” —* that condition is met ~

25

7

"then the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable

*

3

2

year shall be the lesser of the following" ■— and now there

3

are the two numbered paragraphs,

(4) and (5)»

I think it is convenient to say the taxpayer has his

4
5

option of proceeding under one or the other«

6

statute says that the tax shall be the lesser of these two,
"(4) the tax for the taxable year computed with such

■7
i

8

deduction"

9

in ~ the word in paragraph (2) .

10

Actually, the

and you notice the deduction goes back to the item

"(5)"

and (5) is fairly long, but it says in

11

substance that the other matter which is to be computed

12

determining which is the lesser is, in effect, to take the

21

22

24
25

amount out of the prior taxable year, reducing the taxes for
this year by the taxes which were, as it now develops,
improperly paid in the earlier year.
Nov/, the fact is that Section 1341(a)(5), the
language on page 11 of the Government's brief, was not utilized
by the taxpayer here,

This cases arises with respect to

Section 1341(a)(4), which provides that the tax for the taxable
year computed with such deduction is the amount which is to
be taken into account,

I suggest that that leaves the

situation exactly where it would have been if Section 1341 had
never been enacted, because the tax for the taxable year would
be computed with such deduction prior to the enactment of
Section 1341

1

The taxpayer here simply found it desirable not to

2

use the relief which Section 1341 provided through paragraph (5)

3

because that would have been less advantageous than its claim

4

under paragraph (a)(4)0

5

Interestingly enough, this was expressly recognized

6

by the court below in its first opinion.

7

of the Appendix in Judge Seth's opinion, beginning the first

8

full paragraph on that pages

9

This is on page 42

"Thus, it appears that Congress by Section 1341

10

enacted the existing rule as to current-year deductions and

11

added another and new provision.

12

the existing rule, the rule that would have been applicable

3
4
5
6

But 1341(a)(4) is simply

if 1341 had never been passed.”
Then later in the same paragraph, a little below the
middle of the paragraphs
“Thus, it must be concluded that Congress sought to

7

make no change in the current-year deduction remedy but only

8

added the recomputation provision."

9

In our view the Court was thoroughly sound in saying

20

that, but simply did not pursue it through to its conclusion,

21

because the majority of the court below reached its result, in

22

effect, by construing Section 1341 and saying that the word

23

“deduction" in those several provisions must be read as having

24

the same meaning as the word "item" in paragraph (1).

25

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, is the law there that if

1

the other alternative that has been used* namely* recomputing

2

the prior year's tax* that in computing that tax you would

have just excluded the item of income but still retained the

depletion?

that it will be after this court has decided this casa»-™

At the present time it is somewhat clouded by

9

the decision of the Tenth Circuit.

That is under a different way of approaching

11

I mean at least* as you say* there are two ways

of approaching it.

17

the earlier year and reducing the tax for this year by the

18

amount of tax which it had paid.

If it had done that* though* would it — you

20

say the law is unclear that in so doing all it would have done

was to exclude the item of income for the prior year?

Q

Then they wouldn't have paid any tax at all.

2

A

Suppose they had had a smaller loss.

Or* putting

3

it another way* Section 1341 is very much a consequence of this

4

court's decision in the Arrowsmith case.
The Arrowsmith case involved a situation where the

5

6

taxpayer received an amount in liquidation of a corporation in

7

one year and returned that as income as a capital gain.

8

later year it was required to make a payment with respect to

9

that on the ground that it was a transferee from the

JO

In a

corporation and the corporation owed money.
There was no suggestion that they were not entitled

11

12

to deduct the amount in the later year.

The only question in

13

the Arrowsmith case was whether the deduction was as a capital

14

loss or as an ordinary loss.

15

the repayment in the later year arose out of the capital

16

transaction* it was to be treated as a capital loss.

And this court held that since

That is a case which we think supports our position

17

18

here.

19

losses are subject to severe restriction as to their

20

deductibility* and they might have included the amount in the

21

earlier year in income* be entitled to deduct it as a capital

22

loss in the later year but get very little benefit from it.

23

But the problem which it presented was that capital

It was for that reason that 1341(a)(5) was enacted*

24

to say that if they got little benefit from it in the later

25

year* they could reduce their tax for the later year by the
11

]

amount of tax which they paid in the earlier year.

2

You also get similar situations where there are

3

changes in the tax rates.

4

rates were exactly the same in each year.

5

that affected the situation, no carry-overs, so that the only

S

reason the taxpayer wanted to use 1341(a)(4) was because it

7

thought, as the Tenth Circuit held, that such deduction in

0

in 1341(a)(1) and allowed the taxpayer to deduct the entire

io

amount of the payment, despite the fact that 27-1/2 percent

n

had already been deducted with respect to the same payment.

12

Nov;, we contend that that is wrong as a matter of

when it is rightly construed, it leaves the well known decision

17

of this court in full operation, which would require the

18

adjustment for which the Government contends.
Now, in some ways the closest of these cases is one

that was decided long ago, United States against Ludey, decided

21

in 1927,

24

time of Solicitor General Mitchell, and I was much interested

25

in reading that brief to find that the argument which he then

opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis, who had a very

Brief for the United States was written in the

12

1

I

made is essentially the argument which we are trying to present

2

here, and it was the argument which was accepted by the Court»

3

The Ludey case involved the determination of the

4

amount of gain on the sale of a mining property»

5

with respect to the year 1917, which was before there was any

5

provision in the statute providing for the adjustment of basis

7

of property on the sale of property»

8

explicitly that the basis of property shall be its cost or its

9

March 13, 1913 value.

10

The statute provided

In that case the taxpayer had deducted depreciation

11

on its machinery.

12

its oil which had been taken out.

13

It arose

It had deducted depletion with respect to

When they came to sell the property, they computed

14

their loss by taking the full cost with no adjustment for the

15

depreciation and depletion which had been sustained.

16

Court of Claims supported the taxpayer in that and said that

17

there was no basis in the statute for the adjustment.

18

was some controvery as to the amount of the adjustment if it

19

was to be made, namely, whether it was the amount which the

20

taxpayer had actually deducted or depletion and depreciation

21

or whether the adjustment to basis should be the amount which

22

they could have deducted if they had taken all that they could

23

and should have taken»

24
25

And the

5

Claims to determine that amount.

Now? the next case chronologically which provides a

7

part of this basis for determining sound principles of tax

3

accounting is Charles Ilfeld Company against Hernandez in

9

292 U. S,

That is a case where a parent company had some

10

subsidiaries? and it filed consolidated returns with those

11

subsidiaries.

12

years involved? and the effect of the consolidated return was

13

that the subsidiaries9 losses were deducted against the

14

parent’s income? which was entirely right and appropriate and

IS

is the function of a consolidated return.

18

The subsidiaries had losses in nearly all of the

But in the year 1927? which was involved in that

17

case? the parent liquidated the subsidiaries.

13

19

little out of the subsidiaries when it liquidated them.

20

sought to deduct on its tax return the amount of the loss

21

which it sustained on the liquidation of the subsidiaries.

22

And since the

Here again there was nothing in the statute 'which

25

this area.

There was a statutory provision

The Commissioner had made regulations? but none of
14

i
*2
2

them really quite fit this particular situ uation.
In the Ilfeld case, in an opinion by Justice Butler,

3

the Court held that the loss could not be taken because, in

4

the Court5s language -*- and this is quoted on page 19 of the

5

Government's brief;

6
7

8
9

"If allowed, this would be the practical equivalent
of double deductione”
That, of course, is exactly the situation which is
involved here.

If the taxpayer here is allowed to deduct the

10

entire amount paid in 1958, it will with respect to this

1?

transaction have deducted an aggregate of 127-1/2 percent of

12

the amount paid, because it has already deducted 27-1/2 percent

13

as percentage depletion.

14

Q

Is it also accurate to say, in effect, that the

15

depletion which was actually taken in the prior year with

16

respect to a certain amount of income from mining, if you then

17

deduct some of the income in a later year and leave that

18

depletion taken in the prior year, you will have taken a much

19

higher percentage of depletion as against the remaining income?

20

Is that the same idea?

21

A

You can say, in effect, that they have deducted

22

27-1/2 percent twice with respect to the same mineral.

23

a little complicated to answer because we are dealing with

24

percentage depletion, and it has—

I understand that.

If that is so, 1341(a)(4),, read simply and literally,

seems to say that for '58 the tax v?ould be computed with the

deduction, namely, the deduction described in paragraph (2),

Mr. Justice, that is pretty close to the

wrong.
It seems to me that

14

maybe the results are a little startling.

But, to my mind,

Let me just take the language, 1341(a)(4)s

17

3the tax for the taxable year computed with such deduction.*8

18

That doesn’t say how much.

19

obviously refers back to 1341(a)(2) as "a deduction."

It says «such deduction.”

That

20

Q

Then what is the deduction under (a)(2)?

21

A

It seems to me that in the statement which you

22

have made, you have taken the next leap, which is to say that

23

"a deduction9’ means in this case $505,000.

24

is nothing in 1341(a)(2) which says that "the deduction" to

25

which "a deduction" refers is $505,000.

I suggest that there

two words* "such deduction.”

Just reading this literally it

A

Clearly it does.

9

Q

And subparagraph (2) would mean that the amount

10

of $505*000* if *— is that the amount of the overpayment?

11

A

That is the amount of the overpayment.

12

Q

Then it would seem to refer to that amount here.

13

Can you tall me why it doesn't?
A

14

Because I think that "a deduction" does not have

15

the same meaning as the words "the amount repaid*" does not have

16

same meaning as the words "an item" in paragraph (1).
Now the "item" was $505*000.

That was what was taken

into income.
Q

19

But* Mr. Solicitor General* paragraph (2) defines

"a deduction" as being the amount allowable for the taxable

to such item or to a portion to such item.

Only, Mr, Justice, if you take the position,

2

which I think is not warranted, that the “deduction" referred

3

to in 1341(a)(2) is the same in amount as the amount of the

4

"item" which was paid out, x-zhat I have been trying to suggest

5

is that the amount of the deduction to which the taxpayer is

6

entitled, under cases like like Ludey — and I repeat that

7

Ludey is the closest case of all — is not the amount paid but

8

is the amount which is properly deductible,
Q

9

I beg your pardon, sir, but if you will bear

10

with me a moment, look at (2).

clearer.

It is to define one of the three conditions

upon which Section 1341 becomes operative.

You mean it defines the circumstances, that is

That is exactly our position.

Are you saying that the taxpayer never did pay

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. CASEY, ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17

MR. CASEY:

May it please the Court:

18

I think that this present discussion points up

19

exactly the problem between the Solicitor General and myself.

20

The "deduction" allowable under subsection 1341(a)(4) is in

21

fact described in 1341(a)(2).

22

included by the taxpayer in gross income in the year of

23

receipt.

24

25

It is the amount which was

We agree with the answer to Mr. Justice White that,
in fact, the taxpayer had a percentage depletion allowance,

21

*£

but with respect to this $505,000, and therefore the $505,000

2

did not drop down in tax into taxable income*

3

But 1341 says it is the amount included in gross income which

4

prevails*

That is true*

Now, we have heard argument here looking to the

5
S

Luday and Ilf eld cases, which further point up the problera

7

which percentage depletion introduces into this specific area*
Mr* Justice White asked a question which I thought

8
9

was going to lead to a discussion of whether there is any given

to

amount which will be recovered from the mineral property*

11

answer to that would be, if the question were asked of meg

12

"Mo, there is no amount to be recovered*"

My

Mow, our attention was directed to the Ludey case,

13
14

where there was in fact a specific dollar basis for property*

15

Ludey dealt with the cost depletion»—»
Q

16

If this so-called "item” had not been included

17

in the previous year9s income, would your percentage depletion

13

taken in that year have been the same?
A

I
I

Mo, sir, it would not.

It would have been 27-1/2 percent of the item

That is absolutely true*

left?
But the problem which

23

that question brings in is, in fact, the finally determined

24

principles of fax accounting which this court has laid down,

25

that is, the annual accounting concept.
22

Q

1

Do you think Congress actually thought in these

2

terms and decided to give a full deduction for the item and

3

leave the depreciation in the previous year intact?
A

4

I can’t tell you that Congress was looking

5

specifically to a depletable income item»

6

that in their own words Congress said if the item is included

7

in gross income—
Q

But I can tel.1 you

But do you think these words, construed as you

say they should be construed, mean that it actually had in

It is difficult for me to imagine that this

would have escaped the attention of the Congress»

passed by the House, it did not include the exception that

14

brings us here under its umbrella»
Q

When 1341 was

But you don't think it is surprising that

Congress would say you may reduce your income, in effect, the
previous year without reducing your depletion?
A

18

I think that is the office of percentage

20

Ilfeld to this case is that in this case talk about two

21

separate and distinct deductions»

22

24

mineral property.

The difficulty that we have in applying Ludey and

It is admitted that the mineral was severed and sold

What would have happened if you had elected to

use (a)(5)?

Then you would have recomputed your tax for the

1
j

;
10
11
12

13
U
15

prior year, wouldn’t you?
A

We would have recomputed the tax for the prior

year by excluding the amount from gross income?
Q

You don’t think you would have had to change

your depletion deduction?
A

This case isn’t before us, but in my opinion we

16

would not, because percentage depletion is predicated upon

17

gross income from the property, which is an entirely different

18

concept of gross income»

19

Q

If you had made the refunds in the same taxable

20

year, then you would not have gotten the benefit of the

21

depletion allowance on those.

Isn’t that right?

22

A

That is exactly right»

23

Q

Isn’t it a little difficult to think the

24

Congress really intended to establish a different rule just

25

because the refunds were made in a subsequent year?
24

i

i

A

I don't think so.

2

Q

There isn't anything in the legislative history

3
4

that 1 have noticed in your brief.
A

We know that Congress enacted Lewis and Healy.

5

They codified it.

6

which says that as of the end of any given taxable period the

7

tax is imposed regardless of advantage or disadvantage to either

8

the Government or the taxpayer.

9

This is the annual accounting principle,

We also know that there are other areas where the

10

time sequence has to some taxpayers and sometimes to the

11

Government disastrous results.

involved in the Gordon case had taken place within one

14

calendar year, the distributions would have qualified for tax

18

different for the taxpayer.

under the code.

This is the problem which is always inhered in the

20

annual accounting method.

21

conjecture whether we wouldn't all be better off using a

22

transactional or an open-account approach to tax computation.

23

But this court has decided, and rightly, that the needs of the

24

Government for annual income preclude that.

25

It always has been the subject of

Now, it is not unusual — in fact, it is rather

usual, and it is what prompted the enactment of 1341 — that

2

when a taxpayer receives claim-of-right income and is required

3

to restore it in the context where in fa,ct he incurs a

deductible expense, the deductible expense incurred in this

case in the year 1958, which, as the Solicitor General says,

6

is the only year before the Court, was not percentage depletion

It was the payment of a lawstiit of the damages in

As though the depletion were an allowance based

on the amount by which physically a reserve is exhausted?
A

17

No, sir.

You shouldn’t compute it that way

18

because that is not the thrust of the percentage depletion

19

allowance.

20

Q

I know, but you are asking us to treat as

21

though the percentage depletion allowance was a fixed amount,

22

based upon, say, the tonnage or the gallons, or something.

23

A

No, that is not my position.

I hope I have not

24

left you with that impression.

I am saying that this taxpayer

25’

incurred a business expense in the years 1952 through 1957,

26

/
1

that is. the reduction of his mineral properties by reason of

2

the severance and sale of the mineral,,
That deduction in those years was computed not on the

3

4

basis of the taxpayer’s cost, not on the basis of a discovery

5

value, but on an ad hoc formula basis which the Congress has

6

proposed,

7

a

50 percent of your taxable income from the property,

settlement of the litigation, which occurred in the year before

11

12

Q

But, again, as Mr, Justice Fortas suggests, if

13

this settlement had been made in the year, your income from

14

mining would have been reduced?

15

A

Yes, sir,

16

Q

And your depletion would have been reduced?

17

A

Yes, sir,

18

Q

Do you believe that if this matter had been

19

specifically presented to the Congress that the Congress would

20

have said that in these circumstances you are entitled to take

25

a double 27-1/2 percent as depletion allowance?

22

A

I don’t think, Mr, Chief Justice, that we can

23

assume for a minute that Congress was unaware of this

24

possibility,

25

Q

I didn’t ask you that,
27

I asked you, if it had

!

been specifically presented to them and discussed in their

2

committees, do you think that they would have arrived at any

3

such conclusion.

4

A

Yes, I do.

5

Q

Can you tell me why they would give 55 percent

6

Number one—

deduction in circumstances of this kind?
A

7

If I could amend the question to be asked of the

8

Congress, not to say, "Would you allow a double percentage

9

depletion allowance," because they haven8t.

We have taken

10

one percentage depletion allowance in each of the years of the

n

receipt of the money.

12

Now, that percentage depletion allowance came to us

13

not because of a successful lawsuit, not because of any other

14

business operation except the severance and sale of our

15

minerals.
Now, Congress clearly had before it a right to do

16
17

what the Government would propose in its case, and that is

18

equalize the tax.

19

parties hold, it had in fact before it a Court of Claims

20

decision which had been decided in 1953, in the Perry case,

21

in which the Court said the only fair way to handle matters of

22

this kind is to go back to the year of receipt and recompute

23

the tax.

25

If all it wanted to do was to make the

are going to strike the balance in the year of restoration.

But they didn’t do that,
I would like to ask you this.

By amending the

8

question that I asked you, does that lead you to the conclusion

9

that this is not a double taking?

10

A

Yes, indeed it does, sir.

Yes it does, because

n

what the Government would propose to do here is take dollars

12

which this taxpayer garnered in the ordinary course of its

13

business and trace those dollars to the settlement, of a

14

lawsuit which took place, in some instances, six years later,

What does this deduction amount to in the

current year, $505,000, according to you?

And what do you

We deduct it from ordinary income-—-

19

Gross income?

20

A

From gross income,

21

Q

Will they let you deduct it from gross income

22
23
24

froEi mining for the current year?
A

I don’t think it is properly deductible from

gross income,
Q

If it were, of course, you would have the
29

I

1

same — your percentage depletion would go down this year?

2

A

Yes, it would*

But*, of course, it isn't really

3

an expense of the current year’s operation of that particular

4

property*

5

Q

I suppose if you were permitted or required to

6

deduct the income from mining for this year, you would have the

7

same effect, roughly, that the Government is contending for.

I guess—

You would reduce—

Yes, you would reduce—

12

A

Percentage depletion, yes, sir.

13

Q

But accounting-wise you may not do that in this

14
15

year, or you don't want to do it?
A

Well, accounting-wise it really isn't a factor

16

that goes into bringing gross income from the property down to

17

taxable income from the property. It is an expense of the

18

business generally, the settlement of a lawsuit, just like

19

compensation to--

20

Q

In any event, in this

particular case the way

21

you deducted it for the 1958 taxes did not go to reduce income

22

from mining, income from the property for purposes of figuring

23

depletion in 1958?

24

A

That is true.

That is right.

25

Q

And you would not w’elcome that suggestion?
30

Yes, sir.

I don't that it

3 ; property.
4

I also would suggest that if Congress wanted to put

5

the parties back where they were \i?ithout the receipt and

6

restoration, it could so easily have done so.
It is very difficult for me to see how an argtimenfc

7

a

could be made* as the District Court found in this case, that

9

all Congress wanted to do was equalize the tax burden, because

!0

it specifically requires that the current year's deduction, as

11

in Lewis and Healy, or the recomputation of the prior year's

12

tax was occasioned solely by excluding the amount from gross

13

incomeo

14

It gives the taxpayer the better of those two worlds,
Q

May I ask you, Mr» Casey, the Solicitor General

15

has for the moment, anyway, clarified my view of the meaning

16

of subparagraph (2)„

17

about that?

18

explained to me that paragraph (2) states the circumstances in

19

which the deduction may be allowed, but it does not purport to

20

describe or define the amount of the deduction,

Is there anything that you want to say

In other words, the Solicitor General has now

21

I take it you disagree with that.

22

A

Yes, I do.

23

Q

Is there any authority one way or the other, or

24
25

what do you have to say about it?
A

When you look to deductions — and the
31

; t

4

1

Government0s brief in this case notes — you can't take a

2

deduction for an item unless you have included it in gross

3

income.

4

The pre-1341 case law was clear on that»
There was a suggestion in a Tax Court case that

5

perhaps taxable income might be the criterion,

6

a tax-benefit rule with the benefit running to the

7

Government.
It is our position that 1341 makes it perfectly

8
9

in other words,

plain that the basis for the deduction here is only inclusion

IQ

of the item in gross income.

The fact that that inclusion

n

gave rise to a tax is immaterial.

12

in gross income was the Government's reward from that

18

inclusion was

14

is immaterial.

The fact that the inclusion

derogated from because of deductible expense

15

We feel that 1341 tells us specifically, if an item

IS

is included in gross income, if the repayment of that item in

17

a subsequent year is a deductible event, as opposed to a non­

18

deductible event, a personal item, for example, if it is

19

deductible, then the measure of the deduction is the amount

20

included in gross income.

21

case lav; prior to the enactment of 1341, that question must now

22

be taken be laid at rest,
Q

23

And if there was any question in

I understand your position, and I have under­

of the property, but then also some other depletion amount

because it doesn't relate to cost or discovery value or any

11

other stated amount, gives rise to conditions which are

12

probably not reconcilable with established doctrine in other

13

areas, with Ludey, who had a cost basis for its property and

14

who recovered that cost through cost depletion and

15

depreciation, with Ilfeld, who had a cost basis in the stock

16

for its subsidiary companies and effectively recovered that

17

basis through the absorption of the subsidiaries' losses

18

against its income.

19

That is the thrust of our argument.

If Congress had

20

intended the results contended for by the Government here, it

21

would have been simply done.

22

I referred earlier to the Court of Claims case

23

decided in 1953 which showed how simply it could be done,

In that case the taxpayer donated

]

the year of the donation and. recovered the property in a later

year, to a tax detriment»

The Court of Claims thought that the fair way to do

4

it would be to look back and see what tax advantage did he

5

get from the donation in the year he made the donation, and

6

it said that should be the measure of his tax detriment in the

7

year of recovery.

But the very Government that is here urging that
approach to the Skelly case prevailed upon the Coourt of

10

claims to overrule the Perry decision, pointing out that the

11

annual accounting concept so ingrained in the tax law by the

12

decisions of this court made that result impossible under the

13

law.

14

recognized its error, went to the annual accounting concept,

15

even though the taxpayer in the Alice Phelan Sullivan case

IS

suffered tax-wise drastically.

17

And on the urging of the Government, the Court of Claims

It is a two-way street. If there is going to be tax

18

equalization, it has got to be equalization for the Government

19

and for the taxpayer.

20

there cannot be tax equalization.

21

this court to overrule the decision below are more properly

22

advanced, we submit, to the Congress.

entitled matter was concluded.)
