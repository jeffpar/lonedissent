issued by a three-judge court in the Northern District of
Illinois, which order for purposes of this appeal held un­
constitutional one subsection of the Illinois Intimidation
Statute, Illinois Revised Statute, Chapter 38, Section 12-6(a)(-).
Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by a

title 28, Section 1253 and 2281.

Probable jurisdiction was

noted on the 9th of December 1968.
The posture of this case in the lower court is as

Mr. Chief Justice, your Honors.

This is an appeal from a permanent injunctive order

Mr. Butler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD BUTLER, ESQ.

7

11

Counsel are present.

follows:

A complaint was filed by the plaintiffs purportedly

alleging a conspiracy to violate the plaintiff's constitutional
20
21

22

rights and setting forth that by the use of unconstitutional
statutes on their face or the misuse of statutes which would
be otherwise constitutional, that the plaintiff's constitu­

23
24

tional rights were violated.
The defendants filed a motion to dismiss initially

25

1

alleging four basic grounds.

First, lack of jurisdiction;

z

second, no relief upon which a claim can be granted; third,

3

as to those subelassifications of plaintiffs who had been

4

arrested prior to the filing of the complaint for Federal

5

equitable jurisdiction, the bar. of of 28 USC 283; and lastly,

6

as to those class of plaintiffs who had not been arrested

7

but who were plaintiffs in the case, the claim that the lack

&

of specificity in the complaint takes jurisdiction away from

9

the District Court»

i

10

The single trial judge dismissed the motion to

U

dismiss filed by the defendants.

12

the plaintiffs did have proper standing, that the question of

13

2283 was a premature question because that statute was not

14

jurisdictional, that a three-judge court would be convened

15

and the first order of business upon convening the three-judge

16

court would be to determine the threshold questions of

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

In doing so he stated that

constitutionality with respect to the five enumerated statutes
which the plaintiffs have challenged.
The appellants thereby filed an answer denying the
material allegations of the complaint, and specifically J.n an
affirmative series of affirmative defenses setting forth those
statements which we made in the motion to dismiss.
How the statute in question reads as follows;

A

person commits intimidation when within intent to cause another
to perform or to omit the performance of an act he communicates
3

j

!

to another a threat to perform without lawful authority any

2

one of the following acts and subsection 3 commit a criminal

3

offense.

4

The lower court held that the statute in question

5

was overbroad because it prohibited insubstantial evil.,

6

They said that the Commission of offenses against public

7

order only is not such a substantial evil that, the State may

8

prohibit the threat,

9

And they further stated that the prohibition of

10

insubstantial evil is outweighed by legitimate political

11

discussion on the wide berth»
There are two issues presented for review in this

12

13

case»

14

standing to entitle them to a determination of the constitu­

15

tionality of the intimidation statute, and two, if they do

S6

have such standing whether the First Amendment prohibition

17

against abridgement of speech is violated by a State statute

IS

which prohibits threats to commit a criminal offense where

19

the intention is to force another to surrender his freedom of

20

choice»

21

One* whether the plaintiffs have sufficient requisite

Now as to the standing point the complaint shows

22

the constitutional validity of five Illinois statutes.

23

mob violence statute, resisting arrest, aggrevated assault,

24

aggrevated battery and intimidation»

25

There are seven subclasses of plaintiffs.
4

The

Six of

i

1

subclasses had been arrested in incidents prior to the filing

2

of the Federal declaratory complaint and whose cases were

3

presently pending at the time that the Federal declaratory suit

4

was filed.

5

Q

Were any of those suits under the intimidation

A

None were under the intimidation statute, your

statute?

6
7

Honor.

8

Now as far as the complainants who were not arrested

9
10

but who were party's plaintiff the complaint as the appellant's

11

view it show no specificity with respect to any factual

12

allegation which can be shown to depict a deprivation of

13 i constitutional rights.
■

In my view, reading the 37 paragraph complaint there

14
15

are six paragraphs which have anything at all to do with the.

16

intimidation statute and with the subclassification of the

17

plaintiff's who have challenged the statute under it.

18

was paragraphs 8, 24 and 25, paragraphs 34, 37(b) and 37(f).

That

But in each of those six paragraphs the complaint is

19
20

devoid of any specificity of effect.

21

elusionary allegations.

All we see are con4

I am intimidated because of the

intimidation statute.

22

Now the purported foundation for this case lies in

23

two cases, Dombrowski versus Pfister and Zwickler versus Koota.

24

Both of those cases, your Honors, there were specificity effects

25
f

5

1

at least in Dombrowski there were affidavits filed*

2

offers of proof made*

3

situations where there were prior arrests even though the

4

arrests were not pending at the time of the Federal declaratory

5

relief and lastly there was in the complaint the specific

3

intention shown by the defendant to futur harassment,,

violation of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights*

precept of Dombrowski and Zwickler but rather falls within the
concept of DuBois versus Clark and the recent case of Golden
versus Zwickler*
In DuBois, this Court declined to hear a situation

In both Dombrowski and Zwickler we had

this Court said that no specificity at all

In Golden versus Zwickler we had a situation where

the Court stated that the complaint failed to present probably
because of the lack of specificity of the complaint failed to
present an actual case or controversy.
It is our opinion that the present complaint fails
both the show specificity or to show an actual

case or

controversy.
Q

Now is the situation different at the time of

22

the judgment do you recall in Golden we felt that the three
judge court had erred in making this determination of case

Is this an argument that even on the face .of

a live fight alleged within the four corners of the complaint?
A

17

Well, I know, but this argument based on Golden

this is what I am trying to get clear.

13

15

We would be in

That is our allegation, yes.

Unless this Court

is prepared to allow that much more wide of a latitude than
it seemed that the intendment of Dombrowski was designed to
protect.
Q

Yes.

A

Secondly, as to the issue on the merits, the

appellants contend that a statute which prohibits threats to
commit a criminal offense where the threats are intended to
force another to surrender their freedom of choice is not
7

1

within the purview of the First Amendment.

We contend this

2

upon two factors.

3

statute and secondly the scope of thaFirst Amendment with

4

respect to threatened conduct where the intention is to force

5

another to surrender their freedom of choice.

First, an analysis of the thrust of the

The lower court in this case in a very fine opinion

6
7

found that the intimidation statute as a whole was designed

8

to protect communications intended to compel another to act

9

against his will.
The court defined a threat then and they said a

10
11

12
13
14
15
16

threat was an expression of an intention to inflict harm or
evil against another.

intention, however, that it was a menace, that it must unsettle
the mind of the person on whom it operates and that it must take:
away from his acts that free and voluntary choice which would
alone constitute consent.
They said further that the expression of that threat,

17

18
19

20

They said that it was more than a mere

it must have a reasonable tendency to be carried out by the
threatenor according to its tenant.
of threat.

This is the definition

This is the definition we abide by.
Now yet when the lower court approached the sub­

21

section involved, it shifted its emphasis from the substan­

22
23

tiality of the threat to the substantiality of the crime.
This we feel is what precipiated the error in the lower court's

24

decision.
25
8

The lower court itself stated earlier that the sub-

1
2

stantiality of the crime was not really the important thing

3

because they said that a mere expression of intent to commit

4

a criminal act was not itself sufficient under this statute.
We need the final element of extortion which com­

5

6

pletes the prohibitive act which is the taking

away of that

7

free and voluntary action which alone constitutes consent, so

a

the substantiality of the evil must go to the threat and to

9

the fear committed by that threat as far as the object of the

10

threat is concerned, the victim, and not to the substantiality

ii

or the insubstantiality of the crime threat.
The court made three illustrations to justify their

12
13

proposed opinion.

14

following:

15

'.Q
17
18

IS
20
21

22

25

In the three illustrations were the

A group of dissidents who asked for certain things
or will commit disorderly conduct.
People in a high crime neighborhood who ask for more
police protection or failing to get it threaten to carry
concealed weapons.
And finally, a group of mothers who threaten to block
a highway should they not get a traffic regulatory signal.
And the lower court was of the opinion that since
those crimes that they threatened were so insubstantial when
measured against legitimate political discussion on a wade
berth, that the First Amendment should then protect those
9

I
2

statements.
In those examples the Court in looking to the crime

3

threat failed to observe the main purpose and spirit of the

4

statute toward the person threatened.

5

he threat could be great and the substantiality of the crime

6

need not be great, need be insignificant, can be insignificant.

?

The substantiality of

One example of this would be a threat by an individual

8

to burn two pieces of lumber placed together in the form of a

9

cross in an open field next to a school which is to be inte­

10

grated the next day.

11

threat but yet an insubstantial crime.

12

A situation involving a substantial

A further example, indxvidxaals on a campus who

13

approach the chancellor and tell the chancellor that unless

14

their demands are met within five days that they are going to

15

disrupt classes, that they are going to take over his office,

16

they are not going to threaten him personally or physically,

17

they are not going to destroy a building, but they are just

18

going to make it impossible for the school to function.

19

This

would be a situation where the threat would be

20

very substantial but yet the critrie might be nothing more than

21

disorderly conduct.

22
23

It is appellant's contention that these type of
examples along with the examples cited by the lower court would

24

fall within the purview and concept of this statute and that

25

this statute is valid,
'

10

i

In essence then, what the lower court seems to be

1

2

saying is that the threat of an insignificant crime when they

3

say that the threat of an insignificant crime should not be

4

punished they are really saying that a little bit of illegality

5

is not so bad and can be protected by the First Amendment

6

so long as speech is involved.
Yet examining this issue in the light of First

7
8

Amendment protections it doesn9t seem to meet the category of

8

the First. Amendment precepts.
An extortion by threat is not the edificacy of ideas,

25

it is not the teaching of ideas, it is not the exposition of
ideas, it is not legitimate political discussion on a wide
berth.

The entire history of the cases of this Court from

Baldwin versus Robinson in 1896 to the statement made in
Carroll versus President and Board of Commissioners of
Princess Anne County late last year seemed to indicate that
speech uttered in a context of violence or speech uttered
to follow an illegal course of conduct are not prohibited,
are prohibited rather by the First Amendment.

The First

Amendment should not protect that type of conduct.
In our brief on page 18 and 19 we have set forth
a myriad of cases respecting this point.

I should just like

to mention a few.
In Bridges versus California, where this Court —
a contempt case where this Court reversed a contempt
11

1

convictions this Court was very clear to point out that under

2

no construction therefor — and I am quoting — that under

3

no construction therefor can we take the telegram of Bridges

4

to be a threat to follow an illegal cotirse of conduct.
In Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire where this Court

5
6

said fighting words are no essential part of any exposition of

7

ideas.

8

majority said the Government may cut off a speaker only when

&

his views are no longer views but threaten clearly and

In American Communication versus Douds where the

right to protect.
Even Roth and Smith in the concurring and dissenting

12

13

15

16

opinions, the dissenters, or the individuals who concur stated
that freedom of expression can be suppressed if and to the
extent it is so closely brigaded with illegal action as to be
an. inseparable part of it.
Your Honors, the approval of a little bit of ille­

17
18

gality constitutes the doctrine of permissive lawlessness which
t

19

20
21

22
23
24

this Court has never sanctioned and which I hope it never* will.
How can we allow individuals or pressure groups to
exact gain from others based upon the threat to commit a
criminal offense and at the same time maintain that we live
under a system of order, under a system where First Amendment
rights are protected under a system where individual rights
are first and foremost.

sanctity of free expression of ideas.

Since the protection of

the right of another as freedom of choice stands upon as
equal a footing as the right of the speaker to say it.
Q

May I ask you a question, going back to your

standing point, is it your statement that the complaint on its
face fails to show any charge formal or informal under the
particular statute that the District Court held was uncon­
stitutional, a particular section, is that challenged by
your opponents?
A

Yes, ha challenges it, yes.

Did you ask if my opponent challenges it?
Q

Yes o

A

Yes, he says that there is sufficient standing.

Q

I understand that but I understood your

statement was that as to the group of defendants who were
charged, formally charged, of something this particular statute

and there are no facts to

They said that they were threatened, yes.
My recollection of the complaint is and perhaps

12

I am wrong, is that in one general allegation at the beginning

13

they list this intimidation statute among the others, they

14

come down to saying what the specific defendants are complaininc

15

about this intimidation statute is not referred to.

16

A

That is correct.

17

Q

Am I

18

A

That is correct. Although

right?
they later on restate

19

in conclusory fashion that they are intimidated and harassed

20

by the intimidation statute.

21

Q

Yes.

22

Q

But they don’t allege

23
24
25

that anyStateofficer

actually threatened them with prosecution under the statute?
A

Wo, they don’t.

Q

Of anything?
14

t

A

That is correct,

2

Q

They allege that they feel threatened and

3

intimidated?

4

A

Yes, that is my reading of the complaint,

5

Q

And as a matter of fact they say they are

6

deterred from exercising their free speech?

7

A

Yes, that is correct.

something along the lines of Dorobrowski in the sense of when
and how and where, how did this happen?

Can you just say I

have bean intimidated?

Can you say there are some demonstrations that

I would engage in except for these statutes?

Is that too

general for you?
A

I think there are many demonstrations that one

could engage in and still with the statute.
Q
A

No, how about my question?
Maybe I didn't understand it.
Well, they say there are some demonstrations

that we would engage in except for these statutes.

Is that

too general an allegation to satisfy you?

I think it is, yes.

Q

You want to say on there that there was a

demonstration on such and such a date?

void in that it violates the due process clause of the

And that this is not equivalent to a holding

That is correct, it would have to come under

one of the other sections and may I state to the Court that
there are other specifically enumerated crimes such as bribery,
perjury, theft, anything as far as concealed weapons are
concerned, which would be within the confines of subsection
(a)(3) but not within the confines of subsections (1),
(4), (5),

(2),

(6) and (7) which would fall as well along with this
17

legitimate political discretion.

Q

2

Do you think that these crimes that once

bothered American cities so much like the garage extortion

racket and the cleaners and dyers racket and all those others,

do you think so far as this subsection is concerned those prose­

6

cutions would be wiped out?
A

7

I believe so, your Honor.

I think the legis­

8

lature tried to make specific wherever they can in each of

S

the subsections and then they put in the final section which
was narrowly limited to the prevention of threats to commit

10

a crime and still take in the areas which were not covered by

11

the other subsections.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIS E. REID, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

3

MR. REID:

4

Basically to begin with, I would like to point out

5

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the Court.

and quote from page 8 of my brief:

6

"Legitimate political expression intended to

7

secure changes in society’s legal, political,

8

social, or economic structure frequently takes

9

the form of expressions about future events or

10

conditions.

11

of promises, predictions or warnings, or threats

12

of lawful action."

13

Now apparently the basis of this quote is that the

14

court below deemed it inappropriate to circumscribe a threat

13

of miniscule illegal activity.

16

17

Such expression may be in the form

But what we have here is really a collision between
the right of certain individuals in this society to exercise

18

what has been historical and classical First Amendment free­

19

doms and the right of the State to protects itself and to

20

protect the ordered liberty, without which we would not have

21

any freedom of speech.

22
23
24
25

So we always will have a conflict in this area and
this court has on many occasions tried to resolve that conflict.
But. now we have a statute before this Court which the State
contends is an extortion statute in the classic sense.
19

It is

1

not„

This statute does not require the defendant to take or

2

to attempt to take anything of value from the purported victim.
1 say it is not an extortion statute.

3

It is over­

4

broad.

5

the State against that evil and in fact you have Section (a)(1)

8

of that statute which is not here on appeal and which will

7

remain valid which says, of course, the threat of inflicting

8

physical harm on the person threatened or any other person or

0

on property.

An extortion statute could have been drawn to protect

Now if they want to protect people from extortion
I say well and good the State has an interest in that which is
substantial but when you deal with what they term as the right
of a public official to have freedom of choice,

I say you

have made the statute so bread as to really put a five-year
noose or a $5,000 fine around anyone's neck who have the
temerity to publicly utter that we will march around Mayor
Daly's house and violate let us say an ordinance which maybe
would cause us to pay $100 fine at the most.

Now we must face

five years in the penitentiary or forfeit $5,000.
This is the real guts of this particular case.

The

statute also makes criminal the threat to commit a criminal
21
offense without regard to the degree of the threat.

This is

22
23

the point I am making.
In other words, if you carry out the threat in its

24
final analysis and its going to violate a misdemeanor and it

25
20

I

would be punishable only by fine? why then will you take it

2

one step back and say I am going to

3

you face five years in the penitentiary.

do this tomorrow.

Now

4

X suggest to you that this is the reason that the

5

Court below struck this particular portion of this statute.
Q

6

Don’t you have to have another element under

7

this statute which is, take your example. Mayor Daly, unless

8

you fire the Superintendent of School we are goxng to commit

9

this misdemeanor around your house?

10

A

Yes.

11

Q

And that element of the threat is not part, a

12

That is correct

necessary part of the supposed misdemeanor?
A

13

That is correct.

In other words, in every form

14

of let us say direct action protest, there is always an evil

15

that you are trying to get rid of or there is always some

16

change in the society that you are trying to bring about so

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

I am saying that this statute when you take just historical
direct

action protest it elevates what has been the exposure

of using misdemeanors and punishment by fine or short detention
to the area of a felony.
And I think that it puts a chill on legitimate free
expression of ideas, and a chill on the right of individuals
to determine that they will do something in a way to bring
about legitimate change.
Q

To get around to the first question which X
21
i

1

assume you are going to meet has there been any threat of

2

invoking this statute against an 7 of the plaintiffs here?

3

Against any of the appellees here?
A

4

Yes.

In the complaint we allege a scheme and

5

we alleged a conspiracy and we allege the chronology of events

6

most of whichj in fact all of which took place in 1967.

7

were a series of mass arrests in Chicago involving about three

e

or four incidents, separate and distinct incidents.

statute but we allege they threatened to do so and it would
be a question of whether or not we could prove that they in
fact threatened to use this particular statute but we were
going to prove that there were meetings of officials and they
had set about a scheme of high bonds and to use everything at
their disposal, including the statute.
Q

Did you specifically allege a threat to prose™

cute under this statute?
A

I believe we did.

Now whether or not it is a conclusion as my opposing
counsel said, I would say that we alleged it as a fact.
Q

I missed that if you did and I haven't seen that.
22

!

I would like to be directed to it if there is such an

2

allegation.

Pursuant to, this is page 17 of the appendix

and this is paragraph 34 of the complaint.
Pursuant to the aforesaid plan or scheme defendants

6

have threatened to continue — no strike that —* have

against the plaintiffs herein for the sole purpose of harassing,
intimidating, subjecting and causing to be subjected, plain­
tiffs and their members.
Now I suggest to you that this statement met all of
the statutes including intimidation statute, and I would like
to point out I think at page 18 also which is paragraph 37(a)
where we alleged as a result of those threats — now we never
really got down to the factual issues because we felt that
we could prove that there were meetings of the chief judge,
meetings of the States Attorney's Office and that they had gone
over all of these statutes and we didn't just pull these
statutes out of a hat.

These were the statutes that we had on

information and belief that they were going to use in the
scheme of dealing with so-called mass arrest situations.
Now we allege that.

Now we didn't name names or

dates and meeting places -Q

Your books would have gone only so far as to

25

23

1

show that there had been as I understand you* meetings of
t hese various law enforcement authorities where there had been
discussions of each of these statutes.

That is corrects

Q

That they in the event certain things happened

6

they would bring to bear these statutes?

A

That isI correct»

Q

But was there ever anything in the way of

B
10

coming to any one of these appellees and saying this is what
we are going to do if you do that?
A

11
12

Well* I would suggest no — no one ever pointed

a finger and said they were going to do it directly to us.
Q

13

And you don't have any allegation in here do you

14

that a threat out of the kind that I have just suggested was

15

ever made?
A

16

Wo, not a direct threat but I suggest to the

17

Court that a threat can be just as obvious if it is indirect

18

and. it gets back to you by a third party as if the finger

19

was pointing in your face and said we are going to do this to

20

you.

21

22

Q

Well, I would suppose that law enforcement

authorities would be doing this sort of thing every day in

23

the week, aren't they?

But. fche question here is one of standing and

one of chill and one of -Q

3

Well, frankly, what I am thinking, 1 am not

4

thinking to those so much as I am of the issue which of

5

course we dealt with here only in Golden,

6

A

Yes.

7

Q

And the issue we are on I don't see how you

8

frankly, how this alleges within the principle of Golden, a

9 | case of controversy.

A

10

Well, in Golden the language that I have picked

11

out of Golden states that the difference between an abstract

12

question and a controversy contemplated by the declaratory

13

judgment act is necessarily one of degree, and it w'ould be

14

difficult if if would be possible to fashion a precise test

15

for determining in every case whether there is such a contro-

16

versey.

17
18
'19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Basically the question in each case is whether the
facts alleged under all of these circumstances show’ that there
j
| is a substantial controversy between the parties having
adversely interest of sufficient immediacy and reality toward
.

the issuance of a declaratory

judgment.

Now I am asking this Court to take into account the
fact that you have to look at all of the facts and circum­
stances as to what is alleged in the complaint.

Here we have

had experience with the circumstances that we contended with
25

in the mass arrest circumstances.
We had undergone the mass arrests of 60 people,
some of which were on their front porches»

with the enforcement of this statute which was declared
unconstitutional in this case?
A

With the intimidation statute only.

Actually

no one was ever charged so we had no experience other than let
us say an indirect threat that the next time around we will
not only use mob action but we are going to use the intimi­
dation statute as well.
Q

An indirect threat?

A

Yes.

Q

That is sufficient to declare a statute

unconstitutional?
A

I would say whether or not the threat is

indirect or direct it is still a threat and either I am going
to be chilled in my feeling that I can go out and exert my
first Amendment freedoms or not.
Q

Could you be chilled by rumor?

Well, I would suggest this was more than a rumor.

end as to which statutes we were going to sit down and try to
get the Court to define to be unconstitutional.

I suggest

that in light of what was happening and in light of what we
felt was going to happen to our plaintiffs below and appellees
here that we said in light of these statutes where they have
already taken action and we have this history behind us now
and in light of the fact that we are being threatened in the
future by intimidation statute, let us file a complaint taking
care of what has gone before the mob action, disorderly conduct
27

?

as well as intimidation because we want perspective relief

2

as well as„ you knowf dealing with history»
Q

3

But every one of these cases so farf Mr» Reid,

4

I think this is right* isn’t it -- in Golden, Zwickler had

5

been arrested and convicted* on one occasion for violation of

6

the statute involved.

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

In Cameron and Johnson after the statute was

9
10

enacted the police came down and they arrested all the
picketers.
In Dombrowski we had raids on the plaintiff's offices

and you recall and taking all their papers and all the rest
of it.

And I guess actual indictments of them under some of

those Louisiana statutes.
Now you are carrying this pretty far aren't you to
suggest that merely because officers get together and decide
that they are going to cope with this developing situation by
applying this and that and the other statute but no threat of
any kind to any particular individual, none of your clients
was in fact threatened with a prosecution under this or in
fact threatened that this statute would be brought to bear if
he carried on this conduct.
We don't have anything like that hare.
A

I am suggesting to the Court that your Honors

and from your question I take the attitude or the idea from
28

1

that, that you feel that a police officer must first come down

2

or a State8s attorney and say I am going to charge you, Ellis

3

Reid.
Q

4

No, what I am suggesting, Mr» Reid, is that the

5

cases where this issue has arisen have all been cases where on

6

the fact the statute was actually applied against the plaintiff

7

who sought the relief, declaratory relief.

e

A

That is correct.

And here at least we don't have that factual

situation.

But I am suggesting that even though that is
y
a difference and I recognize that to be a difference, I am not
trying to minimize that — I am saying you can’t try this case
in a vacuum.

Surely if you said nothing else had happened

before you might be right it would be pretty remote but when
you have the chronology and the dealing with the plaintiffs
below with the other statutes that were in fact applied I
think that the threat became so eminent and immediate and there
was an. actual controversy between live litigants at that point
although the indictment had not followed them and no one had
come down to make an arrest I still think although we were in
Court perhaps early I don't think we were in Court too early
as to make the issue one that would be not an actual case or
29

11

controversy and 1 am asking you to really look at the facts

2

and. circumstances involving the mass arrest situation where

they used other statutes and

Well, did this case come up on a motion to

dismiss?

8

A

It did.

Q

Was it after an answer?

10

A

11

No, they came up on a motion to dismiss before

Judge Will alone and it was denied.

12

Q

And he denied the motion to dismiss?

13

A

That is correct.

14

He felt that there was sufficient allegations to

15

IS
17

state a claim and, of course, now at that point we were not
s plit off between intimidation, nob action, disorderly conduct,
resisting arrest.

18

Q

But there has never been any facts in this case?

19

A

Other than in some other circumstances what

20

Judge Will termed ad hoc hearings involving whether or not he

21

would enjoin particular prosecutions which came at a subsequent

22

point in time.

hearing dealing with the threat or the nature of the threat

But there has never been an evidentiary

I involved in —Q

Now I take it that the State is saying that
30

1

your allegation in paragraph 34 which is an express allegation

2

that the defendants have threatened the plaintiffs was not a

3

sufficient allegation to survive a motion to dismiss?
A

4

That is what they are saying, and, of course,

the court below sought our way that it was substantial and

6

it is a question of semantics whether or not this -- Q

I know, but whatever the actual facts were is

The question is sufficiency of these alle­

10

A

That is correct.

II

Q

The question is whether you must not only say

12

yon have been threatened but then go on and allege

13

how you have been threatened on a certain day or by a certain

letter or by words or telephone call or what.
A

15

16
17

19
20
21

22

25

That is the issue, and, of course, we contend

that in the totality of the complaint that we have made out a
case on the pleadings.

When you read the complaint as a whole

not picking out certain portions and forgetting others but
when you take it on a whole that we have stated a cause of
action upon which relief could be granted, that is the way the
case was presented below and I would urge the court to deal
with it in that fashion here.

specifically

Q

What do we do with the State's specific denial

A

Well, I would say —•-

of 34?

31

Q

What do we do with that?

A

At that point we did not really get to an

evidentiary hearing because basically the court ——
Q

You say you were threatened and the State says

you were not threatened.
A

That is correct.

Q

On the basis of that* that is all the court had

A

That is what the court had before it, yes.

to go on?

But specifically, though, I have raised the point
in my brief, and I like just to point out to the Court now
that I see that the Court has a great deal of interest in this
point probably in light of Golden, but perhaps I was in error
when I pointed out that this matter comes here really on a
direct appeal and in their jurisdiction statement it is our
contention that this issue was not fairly comprised within
that jurisdictional statement and, therefore, this particular
issue is not before the Court.
Mow I understand that if the

Court wants to deal

with this as a jurisdictional recquisite then the doctrine of
waiver may not apply but it is our contention that this
particular standing argument has been waived because it was
one wherein an appeal should have been taken directly to the
Court of Appeals because it was based on a decision of a
single judge.
32

1
2

Q

Well? you don’t waive»

That is a jurisdictional

irsatter4. isn’t it?
A

3

Well, that is why I am saying that if that is

4

a matter of jurisdiction

5

be one that could be waived but I don't feel that under the

6

circumstances here that it would be a matter of jurisdiction.
Q

7

Did the State ever move to dismiss for want of

jurisdiction or did they just move for failure to state a claiml

Q

I know but the motion to dismiss before Judge

Wills as a single judge that was just a motion to dismiss for
failure to state a cause of action?
A

Correct.

Q

And for those purposes they admitted your

allegations?
A

That is correct, but for those purposes.

Q

And they never moved to dismiss for want of

jurisdiction?

We challenged the disorderly

We challenged the mob action statute.

We challenged the intimidation statute and I believe the

And there were some few others

which we — I don't have a copy ■— where we withdrew more or
19
less a challenge for the court below.

Basically it was two

ordinances and two statutes that were challenged.

Which two?

The two statutes were mob action and the

basis in threats of enforcement you see against you whether you
can just go through the statute book and pick out statutes
which might conceivably be used by the police in a civil rights
demonstration, and then bring an action based on Dombrowski
seeking relief or whether you have got to have a specific
basis and specific threats and specific harassment, specific
action taken under a specific statute before you can utilise
Dombrowski.

I think whan I say look at the totality of

Q

58

And that is the issue I am trying to impress

Yes, but the question perhaps is whether you

have just by general allegation, listing some general statutes
and then inserting a general allegation that you are threatened
with harassment under those statutes — that is your paragraph
34

whether you made out a basis, whether you made out or

whether you have got a complaint that really comes under
Dombrowski.

Now Dombrowski is quite a different kind of case

and it is at least arguable that Dombrowski is quite a different
kind of case than you have been presenting to us with respect
37

1

to the intimidation statute because all you have alleged here

2

is very general statement embracing a number of statutes without

3

any particularization and embracing and alleging a general

4

danger of prosecution again so far as this statute is concerned

5

without any particularization.

6

A

Yes, I can see your concern but again I am

7

saying that had nothing occurred, had no one been arrested,

8

rather than the many, many people who were arrested, perhaps

9

you would be right.

But here we had a series of arrests, mass

30

arrests and here we had albeit other statutes and ordinances

11

used that showed a scheme to deal with this type of protest

12

activity in a certain way.

I think then we are in a different position and we

then perhaps, and I urge upon the court, I think we would have
the right to then allege they are not only going to use the
ones they already arrested us on, but you might call it pendant
jurisdiction or whatever you want to deal with, but I am saying
to get away from circuitous litigation let us deal with the
total problem now because they now are threatening not only to
use mob action and disorderly conduct, they are threatening to
use intimidation, too, so we, therefore, put it in as part and
!

t
parcel of this complaint.
Therefore, I feel that the court below had jurisdiction
and I feel as I stand here now I have standing to sue and the

i

right to attack the intimidation statute also, as well as the

i

1

ones that we attacked below with proper standing and I would

2

say with no allegation below that we did not have proper

3

standing.
Basically for those reasons I would like to urge that I

4

the Court affirm the law because unless we have a basis for

6

dealing with these matters within the framework of the Courts,

7

all of those things that we urge about taking to the streets

8

in a riotous way may come to pass and I would suggest that when

9

we tighten the noose around people8s necks and they become

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD BUTLER, ESQ.

MR. BUTLER:

Several short points on rebuttal, your

Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
MR. BUTLER:

Very well.

First of all in answer to Mr. Justice

White's question with respect to the pleadings on page 30 of
the appendix, first point under the motion to dismiss is that
this court has no jurisdiction and it has been realleged.
Q

Was that argued in the context of case and

controversy?
A

It was argued in the context of case and

controversy in the memorandum thctfc was filed, yes, which is
39

■f

1

not a part of this„
Q

2

It doesn’t appeal: on this,, Judge Wills' opinion

3

of a motion to dismiss that he ever dealt with this in the

4

context of declaratory judgment rather than an injunctive

5

relief?
A

6

He dealt with it in the context of Dombrowski

7

generally, your Honor, where there is a statement, I believe,

8

on page 487 of Dombrowski which said that the minimum require­

9
10
11
12

ments of standing have been lessened and the court, the three
judge court, on page 64 of the appendix, footnotes 25 and 26
repeated that statement in a manner in which it seemed to
indicate that the standing requirement was lessened.
Q

13
14
15

specifically to the elements of either injunction or declaratory
judgment with respect to this threat statute?
A

16
1?

18

21

22
23
24

Yes, I believe in all fairness to him, I believe

he tried to attribute it toward the declaratory judgment phase,
not the injunctive phase.

19

20

But at least he never did address himself

Q

I don’t see it even mentioned the declaratory

A

Well, no, well, maybe not in the opinion.

phase.

Probably not in the record, but I was cognizant at least ——
Q

But either declaratory or injunctive was not —

in either aspect he didn’t talk about that particular-- A

No, that is correct.

25
40

But we must remember that.

1

Zwickler versus Koota had been decided at the time of this and

2

he was cognisant of it although it doesn't appear.

3

Also, as far as paragraph 34 is concerned, your Honor,

4

I see no difference between the allegations which I contend are

S

conclusory in that respect or in a civil case where I state

6

that someone else was negligent and someone else committed a

7

tort against me.

8

that has any kind of even quasi-specificity.

9

I think that is conclusory.

I don't think

I think I could take paragraph 34, as it had been

10

pointed out by one of the Justices earlier, and include every

11

single State of Illinois Criminal Statute in paragraph 34

12

because all I have to say is I am in fear.

13
14
15

16
17

Q

Thirty-four says more than that; 34 "says

defendants have threatened.
A

Well, I think the same allegation could be made.

Defendants have threatened to use every single statute.
Q

Do you think that on a mbtion to dismiss for

18

failure to state an equitable claim that you could say that

19

you hadn't threatened these people?

20

A

I think so, yes.

Because a motion to dismiss

21

admits all pleaded allegations but the question is whether

22

that is well pleaded.

23

Q

24
25

So you wouldn’t admit it by that motion to have

t hreatened anybody?
A

No, I would admit only well pleaded allegations
41

1

and if something says I have been threatened it is the same as

2

saying I have a tort committed against roe.

3

negligent,

4
5

Q

Someone has been

This says defendants have threatened and con-

tinue to threaten.

6

A

When someone says a defendant is threatened,

7

that is a conclusion.

£5

a conclusion based upon something else with something else

9

not involved here.

How did the threat come about.

That is

10

Q

That is just a general description of the facts.

11

A

I respectfully disagree with you as far as

12

that is concerned.

1 think it is not.

13

Q

What do you think a conclusion is?

14

A

I think a conclusion is something that is based

15

upon a series of other statements.

16

committed a negligent act against you and have a complaint

17

withstand a motion to dismiss.

18

as far as a certain time and a place in an automobile when you

19

went into the back of my automobile.

20

I can't say that I

I can say that you injured me

I could make a conclusion from the basis of those

21

statements but I can't j\3st make the statement and expect it

22

to withstand the motion.

23
24
25

Q

Do you have any cases indicating that this kind,

of an allegation is insufficient?
A

No, I have no cases, your Honor.
42

1

Q

Anywhere?

2

A

No, Dombrowski and Zwickler and the rest of the

3

cases have been quite difficult and up until Golden versus

4

Zwickler was taken I didn’t know myself whether a standing

5

argument would be sufficient in this case.

6

Q

How about a civil tort action in which the
I

7

allegation is made that the six defendants threatened me with

8

bodily harm.

Do you think that would stand up?

9

A

10

your Honor.

11

Q

Like what?

12

A

Like time, like place.

13

Q

Which is evident, which you don't usually plead.

14

A

It can, yes, it can be evidence at times.

Q

Why do you run off the point that you filed an

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23

I think there would have to be something more,

answer and you keep running away from it?
A

No, I am not running away from it, your Honor.

I am not running away from it at all.

The answer was filed,

there was a denial.
I have nothing more.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Very well, Mr. Butler.

(Whereupon, at 1:55 p.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
