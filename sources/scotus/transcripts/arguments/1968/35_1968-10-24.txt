When the Ci~cuit Courts, now the Courts of Appeals,
were created certa\nly they ob~a1ned no greater power of

4

1

review than thii: court !:>ad, when it itself w2.s passing on

2

appeal3 from the District Courts.
And the hiFtory or the Circuits in the early days

3

4

was early acceptance of this ru::.e which h""d been promulgated 'Jy

5

this cou1•·.; - that trere was no power under the Seventh Amend-

6

ment to 1.nter 'ere on the ba::.,•~ of the e:<cessiver,es6 of a

7

verdict.
That early acceptance gradually, 1.n the Circuits one

8

after another, pas,ed to arguments wh'ch constituted a

9

rationalization of reasons why they should have some power of

10

interference.

11

And finally, in the last twenty years, specifically

12

before 1948, each of' the Co•ir•ts of Apr,eals h-is made -~he state-

13

ment that it has the inhere"lt p011er to in;;erferP. and overrt.le

14

i on the basis of excessiveness alone.

:: II

Th• Courts of Appeals have made three approaches to

the statement of this power which they tave that the Supreme

17

Court did not have vhen it was hearing aopeals itself.

n

First, some of the Courts of Appeal~ have said that

20

the common la11 history which 1ras lookeJ to by the Seventh

Z1

Amendment does not support the position that the early Judges

22

of this court took on these ei_uestions; that, as a matter of
i

23

i fact, when we look to the hi.1tory of tr,e common law procedure be

24

I fore

1791, when the Dmendment was adoptea, that the British courts

20 ldid in fact review, in sort of an appellate procedure, the
5

1

quantum of a verdict a~ well as the weiP,ht of evidence.

2

I think is completely erroneous and has no basis whatsoever.

3

This,

It is based entire).y upon the f~ct that the Engli~~

4

Court of Queen's Bench deci~ed en bane motions for new trial

3

which may have been tried before one of' the•r judges at th:

6

assizes.
But Justice Story ln the Parsons v. Bedford case

7
8

realized that as well as all of the early judges of this cou,:>t

9

when he said •·hat there couJ.d be no rev1.e\1 of questions of

0

11 f'act except in the court in which the case was tried, or to
I

which it was returned - cert~1nly, recogniz1.nP, the fact chat

11

12
13
14

II

Queen's Bench sat as a court en bane.

I' today

And so any rationalization that the Court of Appea'..s
is like Westminster sitting 1n Queen's Bench en bane

15

because some of the history books tel 1. us sometimes the triaJ.

IS

Judge did not sit in the cot.rt en bane cer',ainly has no basis

17

historically.
The fact is, and the 1ri ters have said and we have

f8
19

studied every one of the cases which have been referred to by

20

any of the Courts of Appeals, there is no case reported prior

21

to 1791 in the English books in which a ne~1 trial was granteo.

22

except for e~ror of law in which the trtal judge did not uit

23

24

Westminster upon the hearing of a motion.

Ii
11

I' ta1cen
.,

Now, a second tack which has been taken, and which was
by the S rood Circuit in the early cases upon which our

6

t

court relied, was that true it is, and this court has held,

2

tHat a review of a quantum of the evidence may not ordinarily be

3

made by an Appellate Court under the Seventh Amendment because

4

this is the review of a que~tion of fact, and that this court

5

has said time and time again - but, said the Second Circuit

6

and others fo"o111ng it, th•re must be

n upper limit.

That is, a verdic,.; may be somewhat excessive.

But it may l'each

udge in pa, sing upon that verdict

No pffort :l.s made by any or tre Courts of Appeal to

13
14

explain how this question of fact, the excessiveness of a

15

verdict, is transmuted tnto a question :>flaw by saying,

16

"We are not reviewing the verdict; we are revtewing the dis-

17

cretion of a trial judge and whE'trer he has abused that

18

discretion."

19

And if that be true, that discretion may be reviewed

20

and may be set aaide because of abuse, on what basis should it

21

be made?

22

Appeal except to say that each case rr.ust he decided on its own

23

facts,

24
25

I

This has never been explained by any of the Courts of

We w11:i. not review for mere excessiveness.
But this particular case looks like one 1n which t1

trial Judge was way out of Line, even trough he saw the witne<J,e.!
"i

1

1

he heard all the evidence, he was 1n a much better position

2

than we, nevertheless he was so far out of line that we say he

3

abused his discretion, and that then becomes a question of law

4 ! but wi'ch no explanation as l;o how this may be transmuted into

j

i:.

6

question of la11 ancl com~ outside the purview of the Seventh

Amendment.

I

I

j
And the third rationalization has been that modern
!
a j times require a re-interpretation of the Seventh Amendment, and
7

that t':lis prohibition against the review of fact in modern times,

must b? re-examined, and since this couPt has ~one so far a~ to

M • ment may now be re-interpreted and we may now say that although
15

1G

judge has approved them, that in this type of case where there

17

is an excess! veness involved this is an exception, this court

ta

should now re-interpret the amendment to say that here we will

ID

permit it.
This court has never done this.

20

'rhe Courts of Appeals

21

have, on various occasions, looked to some of the expressions

22

that this Court has made in refusing to pass on this question

23 ' since 1879, the latest one llein.-s i,1 the Neese v. Southern Rail- '

way in 1955, where the specific question was posed on a pre-

24

1.o !cisely similar situation, and w~at this Court said was,

I

I

8

"We

will

1

not reach at this time the con,;titutional question because

1

viewing the rs-cord, we cannot Gay that this verdict was not
without support ir> the record," and therefore reversed the

3

Fourth Circuit without going to the constitutional question.
And that may well be the position that this Cour•t

5

s

will decide to take in this case becai.se, as we have pointed

7

out, there in no justification in ~act for the interference by

a

the Second Circuit with this verdict.

There is; no Justification

in fact for the Second C1rc..iit in a vo•e of of;wo judges to one
to decidl' that the trial jud~e who saw the witness and heard
the evidence abused hi:; dis~retion in permitting this verdict

'

to stand.

12

The Second Circuit majority d:!.d not even take t~e

3

troubJ.e to review in its opi~ion the evidence to determine

14

whether in the language of th:tr; Court, in the Neese case, this

5

verdict was without support in the record.

s

It contents itself

with saying that this verdict appears to us to be grossly ex-

11

e

cessive, and it; used another phrase which is difficult to

0

rationalize at all.

..o

It said that we cannot find ourselves - and I am
paraphrasin~ - I do not hav,? the precise words before me - able

21

to reach a verdict greater than so much, and therefore directed
a remittitur.

It appears that this constitutional question never

case, where the question was raised but no resolved, the Court

20

so stated in a brief opinion.

21

24

25

As to the cases before Neese ther.e are certainly, it

i must be conceded, sta·~ements in cases of' this Court, particularI

23

In 1955, in the Neese

ly in the last century, which tend to support the viewpoint that

I the petitioner has suggested here.

In no case in my judgment was the kind of review that

1

2

the Appellate Court has performed here before the Court when

3

any sort of statement bearing on this question was made.
As to the cases, more 1•ecent cases in this century,

,i

5

none of them deal directly with this problem but I think they

ti

bear heavily on the problem in that they sugi~est that the test

7

to be applied in apply:i.ng the Seventh lunendmen·~ is really one

8

of substantial justice without principal regard for the forms

9

and practices of common law.

•o
11

12

wbat the Seventh Amendment does do is first to pre1

serv~ the function of the court and juvy as they exist in

I' common

law and ,;he essentials of trial by jury, which the court

13

has said consis, of the jury of twelve presided over b;I," a judge,

14

and a unanimous verdict.

And I think that is the teaching of

the cases which would come to bear in this case.

15

As petitioner has said, all eleven of the Circuit

IS

Courts have considered this constitutional question, some before

17

Neese, some after Neese.

18

All of them have considered in some

measure the very arguments presented here.
Each of the eleven Appellate Courts has concluded

:i.O

that the Court of Appeals does hz.ve constitutional power to

21

review a determination by a Dlstrict Judge which refuses to

22
I

order a new trial on the grou·1d of a ver.d'.ct being excessive.
In addition, a case decided by this Court last term,

25

Neely v. Eli Construction Cornp~-,y, 11hile not directly in point,

13

I

I think by close analysis establishes the power of the Appellate

2

Court to determine that a new trial shall be given.
In that case the cour•t rejected the contention that

3

4

the Court of \ppeals was wi• hout constitutional power either

5

to grant a ju'i;;ment n.o.v. to direct a new trial.

6

it specifically stated that so far as the i-estriction of the

7

Seventh Amendment was concerned, it really was not any greater

e

restriction on the right of jury trial whether a trial court

9

or an Appellate Court were to enter the judgment n.o.v. or a

In so doing

new trial pro\Tided they applied the proper test.

10

The argument is advanced in support of petitioner 1 5

11

12

contention is essentially historic based upon the practice

13

that at common law it was the King's Bench or Queen's Bench

14

which seemed to have plenary power over tr.e amount of the

15

verdict.

16

position petitioners suggest, either as a matter of history or

17

as a matter of constitutional analysis.

I submit that that argument does not support the

First, as a matter of history, the argument really

18

19 : proves too much because at common law 1.t l'o'as not the judge who

I

20 i presided over the trial that had the authority acting alone to
21

determine whether the amount of the verdict was excessive or

22

inadequate.

23

That power did not reside in the single judge who

24

presided over the trial.

Rather the power over verdicts, the

25

amount of verdicts, resided in the full ~ourt of King's Bench
111

t

sitting en bane in Westminster consisting of the four judges,

2

three of whom ~ould not have participated in the trial at all.

3

I submii;, therefor·e, as far as substance is concerned,

4

th:ls re-examination, if you wish,

s

that King's Bench did, which consisted of four judges, really

6

gives in essence the k::.nd of appellate review that we are

7

talking about here, because you had participating in that

a

review three judges who had not been exposed to the tempers of

9

the courtroom, and who brought an element of detachment and

10

O"'

revieu of the jury verdict

objectiveness to this.

11

Furthermore, the right to look over the jury verdic!t

12

was never given solely to that one judge who had participateG

13 /in the trial ?nd who quite possibly had been exposed to the
14

Itempers of the trial.

IJ

Q,

Could that be review by a higher court?

tG

A.

My information is that it could not be reviewed by a

17

higher court.
Q,

In prior law it was only the court where the case was

Hl

tried, even though some 01' the judges pai•ticipated who had not

20

presided at the trtal.
A.

21
22

I think it is formalistic to say it was only the

court before whom the case was tried because three of the men

23 ,sitting on the court had not tried the case.
24

j

Q,

I ask you - - was it not the same judges and the same

25 , court meeting together whlch was compoe>ed of the judges who

15

1

tried it and the other judges who did not try it?

2

A.

That is right.

3

Q

That is the fact of the common law procedure,

4

A.

Those are the facts.

It was not subject to appeal.

My suggestion is chat those

5

facts, particularly the circumstance of the three judges tfho

G

did not si~ in on the trial, had not revie11ed the demeanor of

7

the witnesses, and were looking at it from afar, in effect, did

0

pai,tic,.pate in the examination of the challenge to the jury's

9

verdict as being excessive.

I

It is for that reason that I suggest the cases in this I

10
11

at common law without regard to the formalities of the common

This, I submit in line with the decision of the

Neely case, is simply a matter of dist~ibuting the function of

16

the court as l>ettfeen trial court and an appellate court and

17

does not _go to the division of function or the province of the

18

jury on the one hand and the court on the other.
Nor, I submit does it have any effect on the real

19
20

vital parts of trial by jury as this cou1•t has noted.

12

Q

What about Pennsylvania?

14

A.

I am sorry, I do not know.

I kno·..,

Do you know about that?
If the court please, the

15

petitioner also contends that even if the Court of Appeals can

1G

constitutionally review a trial court's refusal to order a new

17

trial on the ground that the verdict is excessive, that this

18

court erred in exercising that review.

19

The~e are two aspects to this problem, one of which

20

the standard of review 1·1hlch was applied by this Court I think

21

goes to the question of the constitutional power,

22

It is not argued here by respondent that an appellate

23

court has exactly the same kind of power that a trial court has

24

in dealing with the challenge to a verdict as being excessive.

25

The standard of review that this Court applied,and
J7

1

has been applied by the other ten Circuit Courts, is that

2

every benefit of the doubt must be given to the trial court's

3 ; examination of the jury verdict.
4 I·

II

Every deference must be paid to the fact that the

5 1 trial court had a superior opportunity to examine the witnesses

6 '.I and knc,w mox•e about the case.
1

It is only when, after giving every benefit of the
doubt to what the trial court has decided, that the appellate

9

court has the authority, the constitutional authority, which we

•o say the court has here to set aside the action of the trial
11

court as being either without support in the evidence or an

1"

abuse of discretion.

13

The Second Circuit, in perhaps the most detailed ex-

14

amination of this problem in the Dagnello Case in 1961, in which

15

this Court denied cert, went into great deGail as to the limits

16

of appellate court review of a determination by a trial judge

17

n

not to grant a new trial.
That decision of t·rie Second Circuit was written by
Judge Medina, rho wrote this opinion here, and he incorporated

20

the views expressed in Dagnello in'~o his decision here and said

21

he was applying the teaching of that case.
The Dagnello decislon elaborated on the number of

23

wo.,.ds which had been used to describe the kind of a determina-

24

tion that the appellate court must come to before it was

25

Justified in rejecting the determinations of the District Court.

18

t

I think 'chat the words "overly excess! ve,"

2

"monstrous," w:l thout any support in the record all seem to me

3

to mean about the same thing, and that :ls giving what the Dis-

4

trict Court has decided as to be excessiveness charged in the

s

verdict, giving them every benefit of the doubt, nevertheless

6

the court concludes that the amount or -~he verdict simply does

7

not comport with standards of justice.

a

Maybe abuse of' discretion 1s as good a term as ca:-: be

9 1used but in any event appellate court is givin~ the District
10

rI, Court,

the trial court in these circumstances, I suggest,

II

exactly the same kind of benefit of doubt that a District Court

12

mi.st g'-ve to a Jury verdict in considering whether the evidence

13

is sufficient to go to the jury.
Every benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor

14
15

I of the petitioner.

I this

case here - g1 ving every benefit of the doubt, as he said

to the petitioner, his conclusions joined in by the other member

l7

ta

That is precisely what Judge Medina did in

1

01' the court, was that nonetheless the jury verdict was outside

19 1. the

bounds of ..:ppropriateness as set by legal standards and not

20 !simply by subjective standards.
'

Am I right in thinking, Mr. Gribben, that the verdict

21
22

23

was some thousands of dollal's more than the amount sued for?
II.

Your Honor, you are right.

Let me deal with that now,

24

and I would like to suggest orierly, at J.east four different

25

elementa that r believe fully i:.upport the determina·cions by ':-h'l

1

2

excess of any legal standards of reasonableness.

The second point, and this, too, was considered by

While such a handicap as thiF is admittedly serious

8

I suggest it is not worth, in the parlance of damage awards,

10

Q,

11
12

There is no such analysis 1n the Court of Appeals

'opinion, though, is there?
A.

The Court of Appeals did not draw the comparision that

14

I am drawing.

15

No.
A.

1G

The Court of Appeals just aaid this 1s too much.

'rhe Court of Appeals did refe.• to the right foot

18

injuries.
The Court of Appeals at pages 65 and 66 of the record,

19
20
21

22
23

did relate the circumstances of the injury and gave what in the

I judgment of the Court
I

of Appeals was an accurate, factual

description of the injury and of plaintiff's suffering.
Q,

There was no attempt at analysis in the Court of

24

Appeals.

I do not know how you tiould go about it if that is

2.,

part of the probJ.em of the case, how you would go about saying

1

that this man's suffering is figured at $5.00 a second or

2

something like that, and would have been entitled to so much

3

and no more.

4

Appeals here made no attempt to do it, as I see it.

5

said that it is too much.

G

A.

I do not know how you do it.

But the Court of
They just

They made no attempt to compare the $200,000 which

7

the court concluded was the maximum that would be perm1.tted

8

under the law with the $305,000 which the jury had brought in

9

and which the judge had approved.

But they did state his

10

damages and his sufferings in some considerable detail so it

11

was perfectly clear that the Cou,•t of Appeals considered this.

12

I do not think it is incumbent upon them to go out

13

and say, "We think Judge Cooper 11as wrong in assessing it at

14

this, that and the other."

15

the aggregate.
What standard did the Court of Appeals use in

16
17

We think it has to be considered in

determining what his damages were for suffering?

1e

A.

They did not put a dollar amount on suffering.

1D

Q

They just said, "We think it's too much."

20

A.

"We think the whole verdict is too much."

21

Q

Not the whole verdict.

22

23
2/l

25

They said they thought this

was too much, didn't they?
A.

What they said was $126,000 was suggested to the

jury by his own counsel as being the amount involved for loss
of )ast wages and future wages.
22

Th~ difference between $126,000 and $305,000 presumably is for pain and suffering, and I think it is fair to

2

say the Court of Appeals said that shocked them.

They thought

it was too much.
They didn't aay it shocked them, did they?
A.

They sa1d they didn't th1nlc anything over $200,000

would be adeauate.

7

That is just placing themselves :l.n the position of the

')

jury, is it not?

l.l

Saying 'We don't think he suffered that much.'

Mr. Chief J·ustice, I th:l.rk the Court of Appeals took

10

t ' every pain not to put itself in the place of the jury.

,2 II
I

Why?
A.

13

Because of what they said here.
In the opinion they didn't.

14

,

A.

In the opinion, yes.
But in their subjective judgment they d1.d.

1A.

1/

No more so, I think, than any other court in con-

sidering whether evidence should go to a jury or whether
n.o.v. should be granted.

1

There is a problem here in making allowances for what 1

,:.,)

somebody else could possibly think, as for example, what a
jury could think as to whether certain things amount to negli-

?

gence, and yet concluding that no reasonable jury could come
to that conclusion - - not Just that you, the Court, cannot

2

come to that conclusion but :>ealJ.y that no reasonable person

,,

1

could come to that conclusion.

That is the kind of determina-

2

tion made by courts in directing verdicts and entering judgment
n.o.v. all the time.
The Appellate Court did its very best, and I think

the results it had here do indicate

They incorporated by reference their elaborate dis-

cucsions in Dagnello and in which just a few years previously
J·udge Medina had gone into th.ls ve,•y thing about how necessary

1

it was to give every benefit of doubt to the injured party.
In that case, w~th a jury verdict of $97,000 for a

1
!{j

leg that was amputated above the knee, he concluded that was

1·

not in excess of the bounds of reasonableness.
Presumably trial judges see a lot of these cases and

1
<)

l

have some sense of what sort of a going ra~e is for pain and
suffering, to put it in tho~e horrible terms, which we have to.
But this Appellate Court here, w~.'chout saying - we

2

don't believe any reasonable man could have arrived at that 2

2
2

without using any of the conventional magic of our profession they just said - we will set this aside.
A.

It's too much.

I wonder if the court had not exhausted its use of
2

1

the words in the earlier Dagnello opinion.

2

1

When we exhaust the ui,e of words like that we are in
a pretty pickle.

4

Then the Judge went on and described the nature of the

14

difference between the trial Judge's characterization of the

injuries based upon the plaintiff and the doctor's testimony

1G

and the testimony itself, and there is a conaiderable difference

17

between what these candid witnesses said as to their injuries
