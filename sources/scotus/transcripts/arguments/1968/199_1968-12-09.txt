ARGUMENT OF J, STANLEY POTTINGER, ESQ,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, POTTINGER:

3
W>

'

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case presents the question of whether or not a

11
12

District Court has the power or the authority to order the use

13

of discovery interrogatories in habeas corpus proceedings.
This particular question stems from a habeas corpus

14

IS

proceedings below instituted by the petitioner, a Mr. Alfred

16

Walker.

17
IS
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Mr. Walker was arrested and his premises were searched

on the basis, and solely on the basis, of information supplied
to the Oakland police officers by an informant, a lady named
Miss Frances Jenkins.
The record indicated, however, so serious a question
as to the reliability of th© informant, which is the sole basis
which could sustain, constitutionally sustain, probable cause,
that Chief Judge Harris ordered counsel to be appointed and an
evidentiary hearing on this sol® question to be held.
Shortly prior to the evidentiary hearing, petitioner
3

«8

Walker propounded a short set of interrogatories to the respon­

2

dent, inquiring into the possible record that would either

3

establish reliability or unreliability on the part of the in­

4

formant.
The respondent objected to these interrogatories, not

5
3

on the ground that they were inappropriate, but on the ground

7

that the District Court had no authority for permitting their

j
i

3

use in a habeas corpus proceeding.

3

Chief Judge Harris ordered answers to the interrogatories.

iso

The matter was argued and

The respondent immediately sought leave to file a

ii

petition for mandamus or prohibition in the Ninth Circuit, and

12

such leave was granted, thereby postponing the evidentiary hear­

13

ing,

i4

and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did, in fact,

15

order vacating Chief Judge Harris' order.

16

The matter was briefed and argued in the Ninth Circuit
enter an

Petitioner Walker then petitioned for a writ of

17

certiorari and the case is now before you on the basis of a

18

writ issued to the Ninth Circuit,

19

In considering any applicability of discovery pro­

20

cedures to habeas corpus, I think it is essential to bear in

21

mind one indisputable premise: that is that the constitutional

22

and historic validity of the writ of habeas corpus today depend i

23

in large part upon the District Court’s ability to fulfill its

24

duty, to inquire into disputed issues of fact.

25

As this Court stated in the landmark case of Townsend
4

1

against Sain, determination of fact issues in habeas proceed­

2

ings today is the typical and not the rare case.

3

Given this duty# the question arises in this case# an i

4i

in other habeas proceedings, as to what rules, what guidelines,

5

what procedures a District Court can look to in order to ful­

6

fill this fact finding task.

7

We have suggested two basic guidelines, two basic

3

areas, two grounds, which the court might look to.

The first

9

is the application of suitable or appropriate Federal Rules of

'jQ

Civil Procedure, and the second is an application of appro­

11

priate procedures pursuant to the Court's inherent power.

12

I should first like to discuss the applicability of

‘6.3

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, since we believe that

‘s4

the controlling rule, that is, Rule 81{a)(2), supports such an

15
'io

17
18
19

20

application and because we believe that an application of appr-1
priate rules is preferable and clearly preferable to a use of
procedures pursuant to the Court's inherent power.
Q

May I ask you whether there is any indication

on the record here as to x«?hich theory the District Court used
in ordering that the interrogatories be answered?

21

A

No, there is not, Mr. Justice.

22

Q

You do not know in this case whether

23
24
25

the Court

felt.,compelled to do so by the rules, or whether the Court was
acting as a matter of discretionary power?
A

No.

There is no indication whatsoever.

5

All

1

that we can surmise from the record is that the interrogatories

2

were initially propounded pursuant to Federal rules.

3

at the argument on this matter, the Court did not make a ruling

4

on the Federal rules.

5

mission, rather than ruling from the bench, and when the order

“j

7

However,

The Court did take the matter under sub­

of the Court was entered, it deleted any reference to the
Federal rules»

3

The order simply states that interrogatories are to

.{?

be answered, and it did not say pursuant to the Federal Rules
or pursuant to inherent power.

We believe, of course, that,

II

therefore, the ruling of the Court is sustainable on any valid

12

ground.
My understanding of the jurisdiction of the writ of

S3
14

prohibition is that it can only issue if there is no jurisdic­

IS

tion whatsoever to sustain the order in question.

16

that there are two interpretations that Rule 8lCa)(2) will sup-

17

port.

We believe

j
One is the interpretation given by the Ninth Circuit I
18
19

and which is urged upon this Court by respondent, and the secon *

20

is a broader interpretation which is urged upon the Court by

21

petitioner.

22
23
24
25

Rule 81(a)(2) provides that there is no doubt that
some of the rules of Federal procedure are applicable to habeas
corpus, but, it provides that only those rules will be appli­
cable to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is

1

not set forth in statutes of the United States, and, secondly,

2

that the practice has heretofore conformed to the practice in

3

civil actions.

4

The first requirement is not an objection that we con

5

cede in this case because there are no statutes governing the

6

practice presently before the Court and, indeed, the Ninth

7

Circuit did not have a problem with this first requirement.
It is the second requirement that is in issue.

3
9

Under

the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, the Court has read the rule

10

here to require a showing that there is an actual use of the

11

specific procedure, in this case the discovery interrogatories,

12

in civil actions prior to 1938,

13

cedure was reported and. used in habeas corpus proceedings prior

14

to 1938.

15
16

17

and that the exact same pro­

In that event, and only in that event, says the Ninth
Circuit, can appropriate rules be applied today.

We believe

that there is no reason to read the rules so restrictively.

18

Indeed, the language does not necessarily dictate this inter­

19

pretation; nor does the statutory history, which actually is

20

very unelucidating on the entire question.

21

tate this interpretation either.

22
23
24
25

It does not dic­

The language of the statute, frankly, doesn't make
sense under this interpretation, because the result is to make
only those rules, or only those procedures, applicable which
were already applicable prior to 1938, and to that extent, of

1

1

course , that procedure would continue on anyway after the promu L-

2

gation of the Federal rules.

3

The alternative under this narrow interpretation is

4

to make no rules applicable, in which case there was no reason

5

for the provision to be placed in the Federal rules in the

$

first place.

7

not make sense.

3

d

So even on its face, this interpretation does

But a more important reason for rejecting the inter­
pretation is the result that would flow from this interpreta­

■iO

tion.

11

available in habeas corpus to those procedures available in the

12

year 1938, and the entire history of the writ of habeas corpus

13

has been one of growth, of flexibility, of permitting the

14

courts to meet the expanded needs of the writ itself, and cer­

IS

tainly those needs have greatly expanded under the aegis of

16

this Court, under the habeas corpus statutory scheme provided

17

by Congress.

18

The result would be to freeze all procedures which are

We believe it would be an intolerable restraint upon

m

the District Courts to be restricted simply to the narrow and

20

rather formalistic procedures available in the year 1938.

21

Under our interpretation of Rule 81(a) (2), we read

23

the statute to require only a showing that there was a practice
*
in habeas corpus conforming to a practice in civil actions in

24

a more general sense.

22

25

We read it to say that if there was a

general format applicable in habeas corpus, similar to the
8

I

general format in civil proceedings, then those rules which

■>

are suitable to or which facilitate that general format are

3

available today under the rules.

4

In other words, the general format that did apply to

3

habeas corpus prior to 1938 and to civil proceedings prior to

•3

1938 was the development and trial of issues of fact by a court

7

Those two practices were identical or did exist in both civil

8

and habeas proceedings.
We feel that to that extent, rules in the Federal

9
10

Rules of Civil Procedure which facilitate that practice should

21

be available.

12

civil rules governing trials by jury, since there never was a

S3

trial by jury in habeas proceedings and there should not be

14

such a trial today.

This, of course,, would exclude, for instance,

But those rules which are suitable we believe are

15
16

supported by the statute and sound policy dictates their use

17

today.

13

practice that I mentioned on the part of the Ninth Circuit, the

19

expanded duties under the habeas corpus decisions of this Court

20

would require the Court to utilize appropriate rules to that

21

end.

22

For the same reasons as the obverse of the restrictive

Indeed, w© point out in our brief that the vast

23

majority of courts in this country which have utilized rules in

24

habeas corpus have indeed adopted this interpretation, and

25

that no fewer than six circuits in this country, over a period
9

|

of 20 years, have adopted various rules of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure appropriate to the task before them, five
circuits of which have adopted discovery rules.
All of the discovery rules of civil procedure have
been used in habeas proceedings and reported other than, I
believe it is,requests for admissions.

I don't believe we

found a case on that particular proceeding, but all other rules
have been used, including Rule 35.
Q

Do you mean a full sweep of the discovery rules?

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Every discovery rule other

than, I believe, one has bean reported in use in District Court
or in Circuit Courts.
Q

A full sweep of the rules as ordinarily appli­

cable to a civil cause.
A

The full extent of the rules.

But when you say
i

"full sweep/’ it doesn't necessarily mean it would work the
same way in a civil proceeding.

In other words, there are some

distinctions in habeas and civil proceedings which exist and
which, once the rule is applied, would not necessarily let it
be applied to the full extent.
Q

Can you illustrate that?

A

Yes.

This particular problem arises from the

argument by the State that abuse would occur if certain of the
rules, the discovery rules, were permitted in habeas corpus.
I think that the basic objection by the State is one of abuse.
10

1

The State contends that most habeas petitioners today

2

are proceeding in the form of paupers.

3

That is true.

4

a person who is unrestrained by litigation costs would have the

3

ability to use discovery rules, he would greatly burden the

6

State out of an attempt to embarrass them, to burden them for

7

its own sake, to use the rules in bad faith»

'4

We don’t dispute that»

They are indigents„
They contend that if sue i

For this reason, the State contends that it will be
forced to attend hearings to obtain protective orders that it

10

would not otherwise be required to attend or to seek under the

11

present habeas statutory scheme»

i2

simply does not hold water.

But this particular argument

53

First of all, if you look at the habeas corpus —■

‘4

Q

15
16

That is not an unfamiliar argument anyway in the

matter of discovery generally, is it?
A

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

It is not an

17

unfamiliar argument.

18

argument has been met in the last 30 years, it can be met here.

19

That is that the rules themselves provide completely adequate

20

protection, specifically Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil

21

Procedure, which permits the court on its own motion, by an ex

22

parte motion, or by an argument to the motion, to enter fully

23

objective orders.

24
25

We think that initially, the way that

Fully aside from that, it is important to note that
the habeas corpus statutory scheme and the Federal rules, when
11

integrated as they presently exist, would still not permit any
discovery by any petitioner until the matter has been reviewed
by a District Court under present law,

This occurs for a simple

reason.
In section 1915, Title 28, it provides that a form
of pauper’s proceeding cannot commence until an order of the
Court permits it to commence.

Normally, that order is entered

in a show-cause order when the District Court has reviewed the
rquest for the proceeding along with the petition itself.
Rule 33 provides that there can be no discovery with­
out special leave of the Court for 10 days following the com­
mencement of the action?

in other words, following a determi­

nation by the District Court that the action does or does not
have merit in the entrance of a show-cause order.
Rule 26, incidentally, covering depositions, provides
an even longer moratorium of 20 days before any discovery can
commence.

The result is that any petitioner who submits a

petition in the form of paupers or otherwise, cannot even have
the action commence under Pule 33 or the Federal rules until
the District Court has looked at the merits.
Of cotirse, if it is an unmeritorious, frivolous or
burdensome petition, it will be dismissed, as it is today, and
discovery cannot ensue.

If, on the other hand, the Court issue;-

a show-cause order, Title 28 provides that the statements are
filed in return of five days of that order and a hearing on
12

‘i

the entire matter is to be held three days thereafter.

2

if the matter proceeds, there will be a full hearing within the

3

10 days that Rule 33 would commence, within eight days.

4

At that particular hearing, and again

So even

we point out

5

that there can be no discovery even attempted at this point, fch

3

Court will he permitted, in fact, will have, several choices:

7
v

It can either issue the writ, at which point discovery will be

3

immaterial? it can deny the writ, at which point discovery

3

would be immaterial? or.it can order an evidentiary hearing.
Q

10

ti

I gather that in the habeas corpus indictment

it imposes the restraint that you have been mentioning.

52

That is correct.

15

13

A

19

Q

There aren't any comparable restraints in the

That is right.
In the ordinary civil case, one files the

20

complaint and the other side just goes ahead and proceeds in

21

discovery.

22

A

That is exactly .right.

Under the present statu­

23

tory scheme, there are already built-in reviews and restraints

24

on the use of discovery wholly aside from what we believe is a

25

completely adequate restraint in tha Federal rule itself,
13

s

Rule 30„

2

will preclude the kind of abuse that the State will suggest

3

will occur in habeas cases.

4

So we have two separate built-in restraints that

In addition to this, we have to note two other exper­

S

iences with the rules.

6

gated , a prisoner has been permitted to bring a civil rights

7

action, and under that, he has been permitted to invoke the

8

entire spectrum of civil discovery, so that if a prisoner is

9

really interested solely in burdening the State, as the State

to

suggests the bad-faith prisoner supposedly would be doing, he

a

could have done so for the last 30 years.

12

decisions and have been unable to find any number of decisions

13

reported where this kind of abuse took place.

14

Since 1938, when the rules were promul­

Yet we have scoured

In addition to that, we have to point out that severa L

IS

circuits have, for many years now, applied discovery rules

16

directly to habeas proceedings, and yet over these past few

n

years that this application has been available, wa find no

18

cases reported where prisoners have abused the availability of

19

the Federal rules.

20
21

22
23
24
25

So not only does the statutory scheme preclude abuse,j
but experience that has already been had with the rules, both
in habeas and civil rights cases, indicates that abuse simply
is non-existent.
Q

How much discovery do you think in a habeas

proceeding is available to the State?
14

1

A

Welly I think that in habeas proceedings the

2

issue is not one of guilt or innocence and, therefore, does not

3

involve the self-incrimination privilege»

4

often one that even involves the testimony of the petitioner»

5

It is not really

In our case, the petitioner couldn't perjure himself,

6

even if he were so inclined»

7

We are dealing with the process by which one is incarcerated,

B

rather than guilt or innocence.

He will not testify on the issue»

I think the State will have just as much discovery

)
10

available to it as the petitioner will»

For instance, it will

11

be available to the State to inquire into any of the matters

\z

surrounding probable cause that it feels appropriate to a par­

13

ticular case,
I would like to point out on this ground that this

14
15

is the second objection tendered by the State; that is, the

18

State feels that it is incongruous to have discovery available

17

in a habeas corpus proceeding which is not to the full extent

13

available in a criminal proceeding.
But we wish to point out that that objection also is

19

20

invalid.

21

by which one is incarcerated rather than with guilt or inno­

22

cence»

23

in criminal cases simply doesn't apply to habeas corpus cases»

24
25

For one reason, because we are involved in the process

The reasons for limiting discovery in some instances

The reason for limiting it in criminal cases has
traditionally been not the belief that discovery would not lead
15

1

to the objective discovery of truth, but, rather, that there

2

are counterbalancing considerations:

3

defendant could tamper with witnesses who he discovered through

4

the discovery process? and, second, he could use the self-

3

incrimination privilege to deter the State from discovery again st

S

him.

7
S
9

Q

Number 1, that a guilty

California has liberal discovery provisions in

its law, doesn5t it?
A

Yes, I believe that is correct®

California does

10

have perhaps the most liberal discovery provisions of any State

11

in the Union.

12

Federal habeas corpus, I think it is important to point out in

S3

addition to that that in any State in the country the reasons

<4

for limiting criminal discovery in some cases simply do not

15

apply in habeas corpus cases,

But since we are dealing here, in addition, with

18

In addition to that, it is important to note that

17

where criminal Rule 16, which has greatly expanded criminal

<8

discovery, does not fully compliment civil discovery, the in­

19

herent power of the Court does»

20

criminal Rule 16 has not permitted complete discovery to the

21

same extent it would be under the Federal Rules of Civil Pro­

22

cedure, Courts have quite frequently exercised their inherent

23

power to go that last mile.

24
25

In other words, even where

We have cited cases in our brief, the Shores case,
the Nolte case, and other cases, where the Courts have
)

16

1

complimented civil discovery.

2

a valid objection to extending discovery devices in habeas pro­

3

ceedings on this ground.

4

objection which should control in this case.

5

Q

So we don't feel that there is

At any rate, it is certainly not an

Of course , in an ordinary criminal case, the

6

parties are the State as prosecutor and the defendant as the

7

person under indictment or against whom information has been had.

3

Habeas corpus is slightly different in that the plaintiff, the

3

petitioner, the applicant, is the man in custody and the defen­

30

dant or respondent is custodian.

33

dian knows the answers to these questions.

12
33

How would he know?

I don't know'that the custo­

How would the warden of a peni­

tentiary know anything about Frances Jenkins?
A

Mr. Justice, what happens is that in this par­

15

ticular case the warden will not know of his own first-hand

16

knowledge much information.

17

not know much information about Frances Jenkins.

At least to my knowledge he will

development of the writ, the

21

interest is the State.

22

respondent has always been named

Just as the use of civil discovery has been permitted

23

against nominal parties, where the real party in interest

24

comes forth with the real information in question, so it would

25

be in our case, and so it would be in habeas cases generally»

17

The warden is still going to be the nominal party»

2

Since it is the State who represents him, . the same attorneys,

the real parties in interest are those witnesses who are State

witnesses and who, therefore, should furnish the information.

I am not attempting in my question to be tech­

habeas corpus case.

It was not construed as such, 1 believe, by the

Court or any of the parties, Mr• Justice.

12

Q

Pursuant to what power?

13

A

Of procedures, either through the Federal rules

14

15

devices could be applied to habeas corpus proceedings by a

16

The one is the inherent power

It would be a lot better for you, wouldn't it,

if you could hang onto some act of Congress?
A

n

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that we would much

16

81(a)(2) as opposed to having this order sustained below

pursuant to inherent power.

18

That is

We would prefer to have the rules extended pursuant to

Because while we believe that there is no question

19

that the Court in habeas proceedings in particular has the

20

inherent power and the discretion to act to the ends of the

21

duties before the Court, in this case to try issues of fact.

22

We believe that it is preferable to have the rules applied

23

where appropriate, because the rules are codified, they are

24

available to all attorneys, they are available to petitioners

25

and the entire body of law that has grown up around the practice
24

set forth in the Federal Rules of procedure would be available

2

throughout the country.

3

On the other hands, if procedures were to be adopted

4

pursuant to the inherent power of the Court,, and if that

5

were the sole ground for sustaining the District Court's

6

order in this Court, then we would find that various District

7

Courts throughout the country would adopt appropriate procedures

on an ad hoc basis.

9

various reports.

Their decisions would be scattered through

There would be a lack of uniformity.

And

10

while it is important that, as an alternative, inherent power

11

is an important ground and a valid ground for sustaining

12

the order, we have no doubt that it would be preferable to have

1.3

the Federal Rules apply.

14

Q

Maybe no one else would be bothered by the

15

Court, but it gives me troubles talking about inherent power

16

to do what is practical in legislation.

17

Q

You do have an act of Congress explicitly

18

applicable to habeas corpos, don't you, and I am referring to

19

2246, which says that on application for a writ of habeas corpus,

20

evidence may be taken orally or by deposition or, in the dis­

21

cretion of the Judge, by affidavit.

22
23

24
25

If affidavits are admitted

any party shall have the right to propound written interroga­
tories to the affiants or to file answering affidavits.
A

Mr. Justice Stewart, that provision, however,

most definitely does not deal with discovery.

25

It deals strictly

1

with evidentiary matters»

Q

7

It simply is not relevant to the

Well, it does regulate and control depositions

8

9

actual hearing in a habeas corpus case and does provide in

these terms that such a hearing need not always conform to the

11

nore formal requirements of a criminal trial, that is evidence

12

may be taken by affidavit, for example, in the discretion of

13

the Judge.

14

And, at least arguably, this means that when Congress

15

las provided this much with respect to interrogatories,

IS

lepositions and affidavits, it did not mean to provide for

17

anything further by way of discovery.

18

A

Well, I suppose that is arguable.

Certainly

19

respondent has argued it.

But we believe that it should be clear

Eroxn decisions which have construed this provision, decisions

Incidentally which have been favorable in the ultimate result

26

for a habeas proceeding and not. for dealing with pretrial

3

Q

There is

one argument of that habeas corpus

4

that I am not sure you made.

5

and it might be more inherent power in connection with the

8

constitutional remedy which is given to the Court than it would

7

in connection with other matters.

8
0
10
11

12

13

A

That it is a constitutional remedy

I believe that is true.

I think that that would

support our position that inherent power is a valid ground for
sustaining the order below.
Q

That gets up close to the questions as to whether

Congress could do away with habeas corpus.
A

I believe that is impossible, if I read the

14

suspension clause correctly in the Constitution.

15

that could be dona.

16

Q

I don’g believe

Mr. Pottinger, I am having a little difficulty .

17

understanding why the written interrogatories procedure would

18

not be effective for you here.

19

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would not be available to

20

petitioner here until he had filed his application for a writ,

21

would they?

22

A

They would not be available even then.

23

Q

I know, and then there would be a lapse of time?

That is correct.

Q

That is right»

A

I think that that is a correct interpretation

2246?

of 2246, insofar as it . applies only to evidence, however.
Q

Whatever it may be, because if a person should

proceed by written interrogatories under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, the interrogatories, presumably, would be

17

18
19
20
21

available, they ordinarily are available to both parties.
A

That is correct.

Q

And the state could introduce whatever the

prisoner does not introduce.

It is a little hard to see that

there is any real operative difference here when you relate the
two procedures, 2246 in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures
to the habeas proceeding, except for the element of power the

22
Judge, under 2246, to say, "No, I am not going to proceed
23
by written interrogatories here,"
24
A

No, I don't believe that is correct, Mr. Justice

25
28

'1

Fortas, because rule 2246 provides for interrogatories only as

2

a means of cross-examining an affiant of an affidavit.

reason to believe that we would have the right or the ability

16

to obtain an affidavit from the State.

17

Q

In this particular case there is no

But the chronology in the peculiar situation of

18

a habeas case, chronology works out so as, I think you very

aptly and very well put it, sir, chronology works out so that

if you don’t have the usual difference between discovery,

21

pre-trial discovery, and the use on trial that you have in a

22

civil proceeding.

23

A

Well, certainly not up until — it is true that

24

the procedure differs greatly until an evidentiary hearing

25

is ordered.
29

At that point, I believe that the procedures are

1
2

directly paralleled, because once an evidentiary proceeding is

3

ordered, then we find ourselves confronted with precisely the

4

same type of determination that

5

with in a civil proceeding and that is to find, develop, present

and draw conclusions of facto

a Gourt and counsel are confront:.ec

proceedings today under, first, Brown against Allen and then

under the mandatory provisions of Townsend against Sain»
We are contending that given that requirement the

11

Court must have the tools to fulfill it and the only tools

12

that it can use to fulfill it are provided either pursuant to

13

its inherent power or preferably pursuant to the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure.
Briefly, there are three other objections that the

15

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

State has tendered»

One is we believe to be somewhat curious.

They have contended that the summary provisions of Section
2243 require a speedy hearing and for this reason discovery
would actually slow down the hearing and be contrary to the
2243.
As I have already pointed out, discovery, on the
contrary, will facilitate and speed the hearing by permitting
the exclusion of the double hearing.

And, secondly,

I think

we need only point out that any delay that is occasioned by a
petitioner's use of discovery is delay of his own choosing.

30

1

Thirdly, I think it is important to point out that

2

the summary provisions of 2243 require the Court to quickly

3

review the matter and not ultimately dispose of the matter

4

quickly„

5

In other words, the review process must get underway

6

quickly after a petition is filed, but if it is in the interest

7

of the petitioner' and Court to develop fact? ultimately to be

8

determined at the evidentiary hearing, certainly the summary

9

provisions of Section 2243 would not suggest that the Court or

10

parties should sacrifice the ultimate justice to be

11

accorded the petitioner through this fact-finding process

12

simply for the sake of speed.

13

If I may, I will reserve the few remaining moments
for rebuttal,

Q

What are the changes in 2241 and 2254?

A

2241 relates essentially to jurisdiction and

provides that when you have a state with more than one Federal
Judicial District that a habeas petition can be entertained
either in the district within which the petitioner is confined
or the district within which his state criminal conviction and
sentence occurred.
2254 provides significant changes with respect to the
presumption of correctness which is to attend a state factual
determination reached af^er a hearing and reflected by written
indicia or findings.

22

Q

And both those amendments were made in the 1960's:’

23

A

1966, yes, Your Honor.

24

Now 1 believe that this policy decision reflected

25

in Rule 31(a)(2) as of 1938 is a very sound one.
33

That it was

1

2
3
4

5

6
7
3

9

to
11
12

sound when made and remains sound today.
First of all, pleading procedures in habeas corpus
.s completely inconsistent with pleading procedure as it exists
tow under the conventional rules of practice for civil litigatio
tnd a habeas petitioner is required to allege with particularity
;hose facts upon which he relies and which if established would
justify him to relief.
When Congress introduced the discovery procedure fchrou fh
:he Civil Rules in 1338 it affected what this Court referred to
is one of the most significant innovations of those rules.

Yet

:hose rules came in along with substantial chaxiges with respect
:o pleading in civil actions as well, simplified pleading,
tnd part of the justification for the change in pleading exists

13

14

.n the fact that discovery techniques are afforded to the
•arties to be exercised by the parties for the purposes of

15
defining issues for fact revelation and such similar purposes.

16
17
18
19

20

Now the justification with this discovery procedure
ias certainly,

in part, in these pleading changes which occurred

is well, simplified pleadings, streamline pleadings.

Yet

.hese pleading changes have no pertinence whatsoever with
■espect to a habeas proceeding.

21

22
23

Now I believe a second sound reason why the framers
bought that not to extend these civil rules with respect to the
iscovery mechanism or habeas proceeding is this:

it is completely

24
nconsistent with the summary nature of a habeas proceeding.

appropriately recognized that the provisions with respect to
civil discovery have no applicability to criminal cases.
Finally, I believe that this policy decision made
bcick in 1938 was sound and remains sound for a further reason.
When I balance the potential for abuse which exists here against
the value potential of the procedure to petitioners, I think
it becomes perfectly apparent that the increase in litigation,
increased burden on Stated attorneys, the danger of harassment

Judicially in the 9th Circuit, and I refer now to
Wilson versus Weigel, the Court has indicated that depositions
as the term

is used in 2246 includes also depositions on writtet

interrogatories»

Wow that is not an acceptance of the

applicability of the civil rules.

It is simply a recognition

that one appropriate way of taking a deposition is by written
interrogatories.

Of course this follows a procedure very much

akin to that set out in Section 31 of the Federal Civil Rules.
Eut in any event 2246 limits depositions to evidentiary

It adhereed to the decision

v/hich Section 2246 regulates deposition and interrogatory
practice.

And, in fact, that this was enacted, 2246 was added

in 1948, a full ten years after the Federal Civil Rules had
been adopted.

Yet not only do we have the

inconsistency

between Rule 26 through 37 of the Federal Civil Rules and 2246
of the habeas act that depositions, interrogatories and so
forth are not permitted for discovery in habeas actions, but we
also have inconsistencies with respect to the use which may be
made of depositions taken or interrogatories, if you will, for
purposes of evidence at a trial.
Under 2246, the section provides simply depositions
may be taken for use as evidence, may

be utilized in taking

evidence at the habeas proceeding.
Rule 26(a), on the other hand, provides a number
of conditions with respect to the utilization which can be made
at the trial of depositions taken pursuant to it.

Again, when

Congress added 2246 in 1948, I submit, it specifically rejected
38

any suggestion that discovery techniques such as those found

in Civil Rules should be applicable in a habeas proceeding.

to make any showing prior to discovery practice in a habeas

9

proceeding, prior to 1938 that is, is extremely significant.

10

Certainly this absence of authority v;as viewed as one

n

of the factors which led this Court to conclude in Minor versus

12

Atlas that there

no traditional inherent power, if you
\

13

were, to order depositions or to authorize deposition for

14

discovery purposes and in admiralty proceedings.

noted specifically that there was no indication of traditional

practice in this regard.

This Court

Turning to the argument, apart from the Civil Rules,

18

the Court has some sort of inherent power to authorize and.

implement and sanction and fashion, if you were, a discovery

20

procedure akin to that found in the Civil Rules, I submit that

21

this is not an appropriate area for an exercise of inherent

22

power.

23

One of the justifications that has been offered

te

24

this Court by petitioner is that such a power can be found

25

within the habeas statutes themselves, the hearing requirement
40

1

imposed by Section 2243 to be heard and resolved.

2

that that affords no basis for implementing or for permitting

3

District Courts to implement, if you ware, discovery practice

4

akin to this.

S

I submit

Now, certainly 2246 within the habeas statutes affords

s

no basis for implementing a discovery practice akin to -this.

7

The time provisions found in 2243, the time requirements, are

8

completely at odds with implementing a discovery procedure

9

akin to that found in the Federal Civil rules.

10

We have argued earlier the pleading requirements with

a discovery procedure.

I would like to add a word as to our view on the
question of power independent from the rules.
W® do not think that question is necessarily raised

24

in this case by virtue of the 9th Circuit, as we read the

25

opinion, essentially finding that there was no authority under
58

1

the Federal Civil Exiles and no specific authority under 2246,

2

The . opinion did not touch beyond that»

3

the issue has been argued and briefed and we have indicated in

our brief that we have a position on this, we believe such a

5

power does assist.

6

Nevertheless, since

I would summarily like to state our views in this

7

regard.

8

the sentencing or habeas judge that this Court has recognised

9

in Fay and Noia and Brown against Allen and in the language

to

that, this Court has used in recent decisions in Sanders and

11

Townsend against Sain, that the Judge is "Free to adopt any

12

appropriate means through inquiry into the legality of the

13

prisoner's detention and the power of inquiry on Federal

14

habeas is plenary."

15

We think this power is part of the equity power of

In answering your question, Mr, Justice Fortas, the

16

Government's position is that the power exists, however, we

17

think that the power should be used quite sparingly only in

13

the rarest of circumstances, since the 2255 route provides the

19

basic framework for resolving these issues.

20

An illustration of a possible fact-finding situation,

21

I think, is Machabroda, where the facts, 368 U.S., where the

22

facts were that claim was made that a defendant had spoken to

23

Government counsel on three occasions in prison.

The Government

24

counsel, in effect, coerced the plea of guilty.

And the question

25

rose whether the prisoner was needed to be present at a hearing.
59

I
?

And Mr, Justice Stewart pointed out that the sentencing Judge

2

could use his common sense.

3

the facts were not in dispute, were outside the record hut

4

easily available and the prisoner would not need to be at

5

such a hearing.

6

That was the kind of thing where

This is the kind of fact-finding, I think, that exists

7

in the sentencing Judge under 2255,

For example, there might

8

be a case where some very extensive scientific records or

9

examinations,

physical examinations, on a claim of mental

10

incompetency.

And the sentencing Judge may feel that, while

11

these may be or not in the actual record, he may feel that the

12

opportunity of defense counsel to examine them prior to the

13

actual hearing might be appropriate to advance the purposes

14

of the hearing.

15

What we are really saying is, yes, there is power

16

sparingly to be employed, very sparingly to be utilised and

17

under the direct control of the sentencing Judge,

18

emphasise that we recognise the dangers of extensive deposition

19

and other interrogatory pre-trial proceedings.

where a sentencing Judge or a habeas Judge deems it appropriate
for that particular case, in the interest of justice, and finds
it

essential to hold some pre-trial discovery.

A

Beyond anything that is authorised.

That is what I thought you said.

But 2255 doesn8t have to prescribe any pro­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. STANLEY POTTINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
7

Mr. Pofcfcinger?

MR. POTTINGER:

May I first correct Mr. Feit in

S

his assertion that there is nothing in the record, at least

9

that he has seen, to indicate that the inherent power authority

10

&as raised below.

11

brief of respondent below, that is Judge Harris below, and it was

12

so interpreted by the State and in the second part of their

13

brief in the 9th Circuit, their supplemental brief, they have

14

dealt with the issue by citing the statement that an examination

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

In fact, it was raised and cited in the

of all authorities other than the rule indicates that there
was not appropriate power.

So the issue is presently and

properly before this Court.
The respondent has suggested that there is a need
for the special Congressional authorisation for the use of
discovery techniques in habeas corpus.

But I think he fails

to recognise that Congress has already dealt with the subject.
He tends to argue, I read his argument to say that
there is no room for any application of any of the rules of
civil procedure to habeas corpus, that this was the intent of
the framers that

’ .
69

X

Of course Rule 31(a)(2) on its face shows very clearly

2

that at least some of the rules are to apply because very

3

clearly it says) to the extent , that certain conditions are met

4

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are to apply to habeas

5

corpus.
The question is not whether any of the rules are to

6
7

apply or not to apply, but which rules are to apply»

And that

0

is the test that we have addressed ourselves to here and in our

9

briefso
Secondly, I think it is important to note that Congress

10

11

has never attempted to regulate the whole of habeas corpus by

12

statute»

13

On the contrary, Sections 2241 through 54, that the

14

habeas corpus statutory scheme has a very skeletal framework»

15

Essentially it codified the common lav? procedure which was a

16

very widespread and well developed procedure in habeas corpus»

17

But it does not pretend to regulate all the procedures»

18

If it did and if respondent’s position were adopted this Court

19

would have to find, for instance, that the appointment of

20

counsel in habeas corpus is no longer permitted, because there

21

is nothing in Congressional authority to suggest that counsel

22

can be appointed in habeas corpus»

Finally, respondent relies on the case of Miner

7

against Atlas for the proposition that this Court should look

8

strictly to Congressional authority because in that case'the

9

Court looked to Congressional authority before extending the

10

use of discovery depositions in admiralty proceedings»

ii

it is perfectly clear from the face of Miner against Atlas

12

that there was in ^admiralty proceedings a blanket exclusion

13

adopted in the rules, that is to say a blanket exclusion of all

Yet

On the contrary, in habeas corpus such a blanket
exclusion was considered by Congress, by the framers of the
rules and explicitly rejected»

And we have put in our addendum

to our reply brief the indication that this was the case.

And

in place of this blanket exclusion Congress did adopt 81(a (2)
which clearly does extend appropriate Federal rules to habeas
corpus proceedings„
There are other reasons why this Court in Miner and

On the contrarye as I have just mentioned, it is

clear that 81(a)(2} does extend certain of the Federal Rules

of Civil Procedure.

10

Finally, I think it is important to note that we

11

consider this case of the utmost importance to habeas corpus

proceedings and petitioners throughout the country.

13

clear that Townsend against Sain and the other decisions of

14

this Court which have interpreted the common lav? practice

15

and the skeletal framework that Congress has set forth require

16

a Court to develop issues of fact, it is clear that interrogatories

17

should be permitted in this case and appropriately in other

18

eases as well.

For if it is

I would like to close by pointing out that in this

20

particular case there is no doubt that the evidentiary hearing

21

that Mr. Walker will ultimately come to will turn greatly upon

22

the information that we have requested in these interrogatories.

23

Without this information it will be virtually impossible for

24

counsel to know what witnesses to call at that hearing.

Why can’t you get all that right at the hearing?

A

Yes, that is correct,

Q

Why do you need to get all of this in advance

of the hearing?

Why isn’t the hearing the place for that

under the provisions of 2246?
...

A

The short answer to that, Mr, Justice, is that

we need the information for all the reasons that civil litigants
need discovery to prepare a trial in a civil case,
Q

The issue here, as I understand it, is whether

or not there was probable cause for a search of a hotel room
across the bay, across San Francisco Bay?
A

That is correct,

Q

Whether or not one Francis somebody or other

was a reliable informant,
A

Right,

Q

And that issue can be developed right there in

1
2

the hearing, can't it?
A

No, I don8t believe it can for this reason^

3

And it is important to look at the reasons that exist in this

4

case and which were argued to the District Court, because Chief

5

Judge Harris asked precisely the question you are asking

6

now and was convinced that interrogatories were essential*

7

The reasons are these;

The preliminary hearing for

8

Mr* Walker, there was testimony by the arresting officer

9

that they had 29 prior arrests and convictions and on that grounl

10

and explicitly on that ground the Court found reliability and

11

therefore found probable cause.

12

same officer could only testify to two such occasions.

13

of those occasions turned out to be a lack of conviction.

14

fact, it indicates that perhaps the information was unreliable

that was given by Miss Jenkins,

herself has sworn under penalty of perjury she did not give

17

information to the police on it.

18

At the petitioner's trial that
One
In

The other occasion Miss Jenkins

Now we have this direct conflict.

And for that

19

reason the Court saw that it very well may be that the informant

20

who now contends, in effect, that she was not reliable to

n

the same extent that the police contend the Court find that

12

that issue must be resolved.

23

police officer is called at that hearing, which is the last

24

chance for Mr, Walker, and ask .him at that time for the first

25

time the same questions which we asked in those interrogatories,

it.

If he says,

I will have no way to know how to rebut

I will have no way to know how to impeach

him if necessary.

I will have no way to know what other witnesses he should call

or I should call.

Q

I would suggest that you are even going to be

more limited on your interrogatories because when you are asking
■the Warden these questions, the honest answer to your questions
is, "I don't know."
A

Perhaps if that defect, or that technicality

is controlling, we will have to resolve it by addressing the
interrogatories directly to the state under the theory that
the stats is the real party in interest»

And for that reason

we will nonetheless secure these answers directly from the
police officer.
But I consider the law to take care of that particular
question at the present time because the real party in interest j
theory would seem to us to allow us to get behind the Warden
to the real party in interest under present standards»

suffering under that rule of discovery than any other civil
rule that has been adopted.

It

is a question of policy,

isn't it?
A

X believe in the initial instance it was.

Q

You don't think it is now?

A

Well, X believe that the policy question has

been answered with regard to habeas corpus,
Q

It has been answered in reference to those it

has bean answered in reference to, yes,
A

Which includes habeas corpus.

Q

Wall, you say then that the rule applies?

A

That is correct.

Q

That is your argument that the rule applies

76

i

1

and we don't have to make up any out of our inherent power

2

to legislate?

3

A

We don't believe so, Mr,, Justice Black, but we

4

believe that in the event that the Court is of a different

5

mind that certainly inherent power is a second alternative,

5

one that is undisputed and on© which flows not only from

7

ess parte Peterson, but from the explicit nature, the implication 3

a

©f Townsend against Sain, which was to command the Court to

9

inquire into issues of fact and to give the petitioner a

10

n

full and fair hearing»
And we believe that in this case, as I have just

12

explained, and in other cases, it will be impossible to give

13

him a full and fair hearing without appropriate discovery»

14

Now, I believe that ---

15

Q

You have made a good argument for him,

16

A

I believe with regard to the civil rules, however

!7

to answer your question directly, that the policy decision was

18

made in 1933 when rule 81(a)(2) was adopted and that decision

19

did include not only an application of the Federal Rules to

£0

general civil proceedings, but also to habeas corpus.

21

properly interpreted, the language of Rule 81(a)(2) would

22

lead the Court to that conclusion.

Thank you.
