Mr. Martin.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

court, I would like to move the admission for the presentation

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. LACOVARA;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court before I begin the statement of the Covington case,
which is now being considered, I would like to clear up a
misapprehension which may be left with the Court.
The tax imposed on the transfer of marihuana to a
non-registrant is $100 per ounce or fraction thereof.

So

while it is possible, according to the Bureau of Narcotics
Statistics, to obtain between 85 and 100 cigarettes from each
ounce of marihuana, the transfer of even a cigarette which
would have perhaps one hundredth of an ounce would still be
subject to a $100 tax, because any transfer of marihuana, no
2

matter how slight, if to a nor “-registrant is subject to the
$10 0 tax o
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Is there anything in the

record to indicate how much the Government did obtain in taxes
from this lav,'?
HR. LACOVARAs
record.

Yes.

That, is a matter of public

In the fiscal year 1967, that would be July 1, 1966,

through June 30, 1967, $177,000 was collected under the
Marihuana Tax Act for calendar year 1967.

The figure is about

$270,000.
Q

That is the hundred dollar and one dollar?

A

This is all revenue collected under the tax.

It

includes the special occupation tax and transfer taxes in the
amounts of one dollar and $100.
Q

Doesn't the Government content that the $100

has never been collected?
A

Absolutely not.

Q

You mean that if I want to transfer marihuana

illegally, illegally under state law, that is, that I would
pay the $100 tax to the Government?
A

If you are not eligible to comply with state

law, you cannot register with the Director of Internal
Revenue under the Marihuana Tax Act.
It is our contention if you are not eligible for
Federal registration, you cannot prepay the tax or obtain

3

(

1

Federal order forms.

2

Q

When do you pay the tax?

3

A

Not always after conviction.

4

After conviction?
After the illegal

transfer has taken place.

S

Q

Then the Government will accept the $100?

6

A

The tax is levied by an assessment.

7

Q

You mean levied by assessment?

8

A

In a civil suit, yes.

&

Q

A

11

Q

If a person is delinquent, is there a penalty

13

A

I am not sure whether the 50-percent surcharge--

14

Q

There is interest, anyway?

A

Yes, there would be 6-percent interest.

IIow do you really distinguish this from Grosso,

So there is liability for the $100 tax?
There absolutely is,

involved?

the payment of the tax itself?
A

1 think there is a very critical distinction.

In Grosso the individual was required to come forward and pay
the tax on his own initiative.

If he failed to do so, he was

subject to criminal prosecution.
Q

You needn't pay the tax yourself, but we can

collect it from you?
A

If the Government bears the burden of proof,

there is nothing

Q

1

Thera is no pressure on the person.

It is just

2

if he doesn't pay the tax* he doesn't break the law.

3

the——There is no additional criminal violtation.

A

4

But if

3

Mr. Justice* there is no additional criminal violtation in not

6

paying the tax after the transaction has occurred.
Q

7

8
9
10

13
14
13
16

The point is that

paying the tax and liabilities for the tax indicates he has
already broken the lav;.

He gets an order form.

He has

illegally transferred marihuana.
A

11

12

That is not the point.

Yes* and the Government is not punishing him

for failure to waive the Fifth Amendment right.

The Government

is saying that we have information you illegally obtained
marihuana.
In practical effect we suggest that there really is
no Fifth Amendment difference in this situation.

The penalty

that is being imposed in the civil assessment is something that
i 13

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

the court expressly in Grosso and Marchetti and Haynes said
was allowable.

The court expressly said the tax is not

invalid in these situations and the Government can take steps
to collect it.
Q

The only thing that the Government may not do

is prosecute the man criminally for not having come forward
to pay the tax.

This act is different from the Firearms and

the Wagering Tax Act.
5
iI

Q

i

Don't you think the Government would get some

2

clue that I transferred narcotics illegally if I have to come

3

forward and pay a tax?

4

A

1 don’t,

Q

Because the only reason I have to pay $100 is

that X transferred it illegally,

What we are saying

Q

And it may be the first thing that the Government

is-™

heard of it* that I transferred it illegally, if I come for­
ward and pay the tax.
A

fir. Justice, I have to reiterate that the way

the statute was drafted and the way it has been interpreted
under the regulations for the past 30 years, an illegal
acquisition, a person acquires marihuana illegally, that is,
in most situations, someone who is not a non-registrant is not
expected to come forward and pay the tax.
Q

lie is expected to pay it—-

A

If the Government brings suit against him and

a judgment is rendered establishing his civil liability, then
the tax is collected as any assessment is.

But it was never

contemplated by Congress,and the administrative agencies have
22
23

never expected it,
Q

On the face of the law is there some criminal

24

liability for not paying the tax?
25

A

2

What we contend the statute says and what it means

Yes.

3

is that any transfer, any receipt of marihuana by an individual

4

who cannot obtain Federal authority for it is a criminal

5

offense because the tax is set up in a way to make it a crime

8

for a person in the course of a taxable transaction to obtain

7

marihuana without the authority to obtain it.

On the other hand you are saying that a man who
Is there anything

If we say this tax law doesn’t exist,, if we look at

15

it as if it didn’t exist or didn't mean what it says, wasn’t

16

counsel in the preceding case correct, that what you are

17

really doing is asking us to write a criminal statute?

18

A

No.

Congress wrote the criminal statute.

We

IS

have cited in our brief, both briefs, the clear legislative

20

history indicating that Congress did intend to achieve an

21

absolute prohibition upon any transfers of marihuana kept in

22

what this court in Sanchez called "legitimate medicinal

23

scientific and industrial channels,85 because there had been

24

four dissents in Doremus and three dissents in Nigro about the

25

ability of Congress to enact complete prohibition by illicit

There still are not,

Q

Is this a tax or fine?

A

I would call it a prohibitory tax as the

constitutional doctrine has developed on that.

It is a tax

which is designed to end a certain sort of conduct like the
selling of state bank notes or the sale of yellow
oleomargarine.

Q

It v/ould have the same effect as a fine.

A

Not a fine.

It is a deterrent rather than a

This never comes up until after you have
Then they file a civil suit to collect the fine.

A

No, to collect the tax.

It is a civil suit rather than a forfeiture
proceeding in form.

When we say it comes up only after you

have violated the law, we are talking only about transfers
that by definition are illegal.

The tax is due and payable and

is paid at the time of the transfer or at the time of acquiring order forms for lawful transactions.
I think that we should not lose sight of the fact,
either, that the regulations which the court has frequently
held, especially when dating from the time of enactment and
when promulgated by the agencies which are to give life to a
statute as in this case, have from within two months after
the passage of the Marihuana Act clearly indicated this is
i

exactly what Congress was intending.

The regulations that were

promulgated on this point under the Marihuana Tax Act are
identical to the regulations under the Harrison Act.

They

provide that, only people who are lawfully registered can
9

1

obtain the order forms for the lawful acquisition of

2

marihuana.
Under the Marihuana Act that is the time that the

3
4

tax is to be paid by those who are lawfully entitled to

S

obtain marihuana.
Counsel in the previous case suggested that this

6
7

was an ingenious and novel construction that the Government

3

invented only after Grosso and Marchetti and Haynes suggested

9

there were constitutional difficulties with this statute.

These regulations date from 1937

e

long before there was any

suggestion that statutes,, which operated even differently as
the wagering and firearms statutes, did involve Fifth Amendment
problems.

This is by no means a novel inventive rejoinder to

resent constitutional development.
The administrative agencies had ample foundation in
the legislative record, including statement on the floor of
the Congress and in the committee reports

„

that this bill is

designed to stamp out illicit marihuana transfers.

Yet it is

designed to prevent marihuana from coming into the hands of
those who would use it for smoking or for addiction.
With this type of legislative background the
Secretary of the Treasury promulgated regulations to effectuate
that objective so that the only transfers of marihuana that
can be made are transfers that are lawful or to lawful
registrants who are complying with state law.
10

These are the

1

only people who are expected to register.

That is what the

The standard for whether the

privilege against self-incrimination prevents prosecution for
violation of a statute focuses on whether compliance with the
statute would have presented real and substantial rather than
imaginary hazards of incrimination.
Q

If that were so, then you would have to defend

this statute, would you not, on some constitutional power of
Congress other than the taxing power?
A
Q

No, sir.
In other words, what you are saying is that this

taxing statute here is not in reality a tax statute.

It is a

prohibitory state, but that x^e should regard the taxing power
as a constitutional basis for the Congressional prohibition.
A

No, sir.

Let me say that this case follows

£

3

5

e
7

e
9

io
ii
12

a fortiori from the case that this court has already decided,,
in Dorenus, Wong Sing»

This court upheld as a legitimate

exercise of the tax power the absolute ban provided in the
Harrison Act for transfers to non-registrants, even though
there is no tax even on the transfer of narcotics under the
Harrison Act,
They said it was enough to say that these prohibi­
tions were designed to keep the transfers aboveboard where the
commodity tax was subject to collection.
0

A little while ago you told us that Congress

didn't follow the Harrison Act model here in order to avoid
the frightful prospect presented by the fact that there were
dissents in Doremus.

13
A

To make it clearer that this was a legitimate

U

exercise of the tax power they imposed the transfer tax.
15
16

The legislative history is clear on this.

This is why they

thought there would be absolutely no constitutional problem
17
under the tax power because these transactions are subject to
18
the taxing pox-zer.

They are subject to a tax.

19
20

It was thought obvious that Congress in its exercise,
of the tax power can legitimately distinguish between types of

2!
taxable transactions and make determinations as to how the
22
transactions must be carried on. if at all.
23
But I would like to say that, as the legislative
24
history does relate in the House committee report, this
25
12

f

naturally being a revenue bill originated in the House , it

2

was expressly stated that insofar as the tax power might be

3

argued not to support a complete prohibition such as was

4

being enacted, the report states it is clear that the

5

commerce power and the other powers of Congress, for instance,

6

power over the District of Columbia and the territories, would

7

also support this,

13
14

15
16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

I mi^ht point out that we have today even a further
support for a complete prohibition such as this,

I think it is

standard constitutional doctrine that even if Congress
misapprehends the power that it is relying on, the statute is
not ultra vires, if there is some constitional support, even
if it is not the clause that Congress relied on to sustain the
statute, the U. S. is now a party to an international
convention in force with some 67 other states, nation states,
which expressly obliges the United States to impose maximum
controls on heroin,

opium and marihuana.

We think that the interplay of all these
constitxitional clauses is more than adequate authority to
sustain the absolute prohibition on illicit transfers that
Congress has enacted and the administrators have implemented.
There was also a claim made that this is a novel
contention because it is inconsistent with what the Government
has advised the Court or Congress in the past.

The petitioner

in the Leary case cited our Sanchez brief, which was the case
13

in which the court sustained the constitutionality of the
$100-per-ounce transfer tax in a civil assessment proceeding»
Nothing we said in Sanchez is in any way inconsistent with
what we say here»
The two sentences quoted in the reply brief by
petitioner in Leary are in the course of a discussion in which
we said Congress went beyond what it had done in the Harrison
Act.

In the Harrison Act it simply enacted a direct prohibi­

tion unrelated to the tax power.

In this act, the Marihuana

Act, wa said in Sanchez, and the court ultimately agreed, it
was constitutional to do it this way.

Congress didn't fashion

a direct prohibition without doing more.

It went beyond this.

In addition to achieving that same effect, it also
provided that there would be revenue raised through the course
of transferring marihuana.

For that reason, as I suggested

before, the controls that were imposed on the transfer of
marihuana were thought to be valid a fortiori from those that
had been sustained, albeit by divided courts in Doremus,
Alston, Webb, Song Sing, and Nigro»
The same thing is true with respect to the memo­
randum by the Treasury relating to the Guam Organic Act.

I

think that is quoted in the amicus brief filed on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union.

That memorandum reflects that

the Marihuana Tax Act is not a complete prohibition on the
transfer of marihuana, as it is not because there are still
14

ii

1

lawful uses for marihuana at least in the United States»

2

still possible to deal in marihuana lawfully.

It is

The Treasury memorandum said there are no lawful

3
4

uses for marihuana in Guam»

5

conducted.

8

preserve the possibility for some legitimate dealings in

7

marihuana in Guam, where it is necessary we will substitute for

a

it a direct categorical prohibition, so that no one in Guam

9

can lawfully deal in marihuana.

10

There is no research being

It is not grown for hemp purposes.

In the U, So that is not true.

Rather- than

There are 90 Federal

11

registrants, who, having complied with state requirements for

12

handling marihuana, are eligible to register under the Federal

13

act and can lawfully transfer marihuana upon payment of the

14

one-dollar-an-ounce transfer tax.

15
16
17
18
13

20
21
22

23
24
15

The essence of all this is that as the act was
drafted with the clear objective of stamping out the transfer
to illegitimate addicts and as the administrative agencies
have consistently administered the act, there is no real
problem of incrimination because those whose obtaining of
marihuana would violate state lav/ are not expected to come
forward to register.

They are not allowed to register.

They

are not expected to come forward to obtain order forms or to
prepay the tax.

They v/ill not be allowed to do this because

Congress was not, unlike the Firearms Case and unlike the
Wagering Case, Congress was not willing to provide Federal
15

sacfcions for this type of conduct with the intent of exposing
it to prosecution under state law.
The Federal and state provisions in this area are in
complete tandem.

Only lawful dealers under state law can

comply with the Federal act.

Anyone who can’t comply with state

law cannot comply with the Federal act.
So we have Federal enforcement power to reinforce as
a matter of Federal law the ban on the transfer of marihuana
for smoking or addiction.

We suggest this is radically

different from the Wagering and the Firearms Cases and that the
reason that people don’t comply with this statute is not that
there is any fear of incrimination.

It is because they are not

eligible to comply because there is a prohibitive tax that is
imposed and a tax which Congress did not contemplate could be
paid before the transaction took place.
I would like to save any remaining time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Davis,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. DAVIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF iiPPELLEE
MR. DAVIS;

Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Members

of the Court, I have not been admitted to the Supreme Court
Bar, and I would request that I be admitted for the purpose of
this suit, since I have been appointed by the Court to
represent the indigent.

I hope to perfect my membership

later.
16

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARRENs

You may proceed with the

argument in this case., Mr, Davis.
MR, DAVISs

Thank you.

First, I want to apologize to the Clerk's Office
and the Court for any problems arising in my presentation of
this case, probably because I was notified in October of 1968.
I was at that time notified that because the Leary case was
coming up at the same time, it was desirable that this case be
argued at the same time.

And I was asked if I could meet the

deadlines.
I was reluctant to try to meet the deadlines because
I am somewhat of an anachronism.

I run a one-man law office.

I however realized the importance of this case, and I almost
took on more than I could chew.
We did manage to get in a brief, and. it is a brief
brief.

I do not apologize for the brevity of the brief, but I

do apologize for the small print.

Just like my Texas colleague

yesterday, I would like to say the brief only cost $1.10 a
copy, so we did save some money, but it might have to be used
for a microscope in order to read the print, it is so small.
It is my hope that I can amend for this in my oral
presentation of this case.
Now, the Covington Case, which is before you,
delineates very sharply the question of the tax because, as the
Government admits, and I was, of course, counsel below, as the
17

1

Government admits we interposed our objection to the statute

2

in a timely manner»

3
4

My client was indicted on. or about September 1967 or
sometime thereafter»

The indictment reads as follows?

"U. So of America versus Henry Preston Covington.

6

That on or about. August 11, 1967, within the Eastern

7

District of the Southern District of Ohio, Henry Preston

8

Covinton, being a transferee of marihuana required to pay the

9

tax imposed by Title 26, U. S„ Code, Section 4741(A), did

that we raised this.

This was not accidental

We had been following the Costello Case

and the Gambling Case in the advance sheets, and we were wait­
ing for the decisions to be reached.
Fortunately for us, the decisions were reached before
we had to answer the indictment.
When, the cases came out, Haynes, Marchetti, and
Grosso, in the same volume of the law decisions, we relied on
these cases to meet this.
So to answer Mr. Justice Stewart's question of
yesterday as to the time of the case, our case did come after
18

1

Haynes, Marchetti, and Grosso,

So there would be no problem

2

of retroactivity if the court desired to follow its decisions

3

in those cases.
Of course,, one of the things that impelled us to make

4
5

the objection to the statute, and I think one of the things

6

that influenced the Federal Judge, Judge Joseph P, Coneri, in

7

sustaining our motion was the dissent of the Chief Justice in

8

the Grosso case, in which he said that;
”... is opening a door to a new wave of a tax on a

9
10

number of Federal registration statutes wherever the registra~

11

tion requirement touches upon allegedly illegal activity,"
Of course, 4722, those engaged in dealing with

12

primarily on the question of the administrative construction of

20

this act to the effect that no person who was illegally

though it is in a tax oriented statute.
We note that the Haynes, Grosso, and Marchetti

I might also indicate one of the statements thht was

made by our Federal Judge below.

After the Judge had struck

down the statute and construed this statute to be unconsti™
tional as applied to this defendant, Covington, the Government
again asked for reconsideration.
On reconsideration it emphasizes the argument that
this man couldn't obtain the narcotics and, therefore, the tax
doesn't apply to him.
The court below made an alternative ruling.

In

23

24

addition to ruling that the statute compelled self-incrimination,
the court answered the Government's argument in the following

25
23

1

manner, and he said:

based explicitly on Section 4741(A),

We feel this is a commendable construction of the

answer to the Government’s argument, and we feel that it is too

does state that the Internal Revenue District is to take an

application for an order form and compare the signature on that

file, that is, those that have paid their occupational tax.

That is all the Government can hang their hat on.

that it is easily explained, that is, if you want to come in

with an application for an order form and pay a dollar-an™

and plenty against it.

In connection with this rather subtle point that you

can*t prepay the tax and that all that an unlawful possessor

7

can do is postpay the tax and go to jail# that is really what

3

the Government is saying.

The statutes themselves expressly

provide to the contrary.

The order form speaks prospectively.

name and address of the proposed vendor and the proposed

The regulations reiterate

The crime, it is interesting, is in 4744 and it says

10

it is unlawful for any person who is a transferee required to

pay the transfer tax imposed by 4741 to acquire marihuana

without having paid such tax.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP Aa LACOVARA, ESQ.-

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

3

MRo LACQVARAs

Mr. Chief Justice,, in answer to the

4

question that you asked Mr, Davis, the Government did argue and

5

assert that illicit transfers of marihuana are taxable

6

civally.

7

On page 17 of tie buff“colored appendix, where a

8

motion for reconsideration in the District Court is set forth,,

9

footnote 3 says, after saying it is impossible to pre-pay the

tax and to obtain an order form, if the prospective transferee
is a non-registrant, of course, the Government is not fore­

12

closed from collecting the $100 tax after it has been estab­

Q

How did the tax to the rater dizzy heights that

are given to us by counsel, something like $2,900-*—

There are 737 grams, which is approximately

29 ounces of marihuana.

There was only 28 cents interest.
