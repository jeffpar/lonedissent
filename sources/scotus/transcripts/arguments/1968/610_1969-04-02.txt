ARGUMENT OF F. MICHAEL AHERN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. AHERN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This appeal has been taken by the State of Connecticut

11

from a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,

12

affirming a lower court ruling.

13

cation of sales and use taxes to the purchase and use of property

14

by nonresident servicemen in Connecticut to be in contravention

15

of Section 514 of the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act.

That ruling held that the appli*

16

This case was instituted by a Naval Lieutenant named

17

Schuman and the United States of America in the District Court

18

for the District of Connecticut, claiming immunity fi^oni the

19

application of the tax to a boat, a pleasure boat, purchased by

20

Lt. Schuman in Connecticut, on the basis that Section 514 of

21

the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act granted that immunity from

22

sales taxes.

'i

23
24
25

The District Court dismissed the claim of Schuman for
lack of jurisdiction, from which no appeal has been taken.

It

granted summary judgment to the United States, which judgment
O

1

was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on July 10, 1968.

2

of Intent to Appeal was filed July 30th, the case was docketed

3

on October 7th, and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on

4

January 13, 1969.
The jurisdiction of this CGurt rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254,

subsection 2.
I should like to state at this time that the State of

7
8

Texas has filed an amicus brief in which 30 other States have

9

joined.

The State of New York and the State of California have

10

each filed independent amicus briefs.

11

fornia in its brief.

Illinois has joined Cali­

We commend these briefs to the Court and. thank the

12
13

States for their interest and efforts in our behalf, smd at the

14

same time I should like to commend to the Court the second part

15

of the brief of the appellee in this case, the United States of

16

America, starting at page 37 through 43, which does not subscribe

17

to the arguments which are presented in the first part of the

18

brief.

19
20
21
22

25

The issues in this case are whether the lower court
erred in determining the Section 514 of the Soldiers and Sailors
Civil Relief Act prohibits the application of sales and use
taxes to the private purchase transactions of servicemen station
ed in the States throughout the country under military orders;
and further, whether Section 514, as interpreted by the Court of
Appeals, is an unconstitutional infringement on reserve powers
3

1

of the States to tax under Article X of the United States Con­

2

stitution.

3

The facts in this case are brief.

The parties to the

4

action stipulated that the everyday purchases of tangible per­

S

sonal property by servicemen are made at PX‘s on military instat

6

lations and are, therefore, not subject to taxation, so they arc

not a part of this case.

1?

This case is involved with purchases of larger
by servicemen, such as pleasure boats, cars, television aets..
and so forth, which they cannot get at PX's.
In the lower court, the District Court, the United

12

States Government presented several affidavits which allegedly-

13

set forth facts illustrative of the situations in which r.fea y;c- .

14

of Connecticut was assessing sales or use taxes against service

15

men in Connecticut.

16

17

18

IS

I should like to address myself to one of

those affidavits at this time, the affidavit of Commander Willie
Foster, which is printed in the record appendix at page 21A
4

through 27A.
Commander Foster was a Texas domiciliary stationed in

20

Connecticut who purchased a car from a Connecticut retail da ale:-::

21

and. paid the tax thereon*

22

claims to have paid a use tax on the transaction.

23
24
25

Commander Foster, in his affidavit,
That state­

ment is in error.
At page 6 and page 23 of the Government brief, it
refers to the Commander

Foster affidavit, and in each instance

4

.

I

it states that Commander Foster paid a use tax to the State of

2

Connecticut»

3

These statements are in error.

The purchase by Commander Foster was from a Connection

4

retail dealer.

5

his sales tax to the dealer.

6

The sale took place within the State and he paid

I direct the Court's attention to page 21A of the

7

record appendix on which is reproduced the invoice covered in

8

the transaction,, and on the invoice it very plainly steifces that

9

sales taxes were paid to the dealer.

Significantly, at page 41

10

of the Government's orief, and this is in the second part, which

11

doesn't agree with the first part, a reference is made to this

12

affidavit, and the reference is that Commander Foster paid a

13

sales tax to the State of Connecticut.

14

In this connection also, my friends from the Attorney

15

General's Office in the State of Texas tell me that I have com­

16

mitted a grievous error in my brief at page 6, wherein I refer

17

to Commander Foster's affidavit and state that after paying a

18

sales tax to the State of Connecticut, Commander Foster was re­

19

quired to pay a use tax to the State of Texas before registering

20

the vehicle.
The Attorney General's Office in Texas advises me that

21

22

since XS61, Texas has had a reciprocity provision in its statutes

23

granting credit for any sales or use taxes paid to another juris­

24

diction on a motor vehicle which is brought into Texas for use

25

therein.

5

?
2

I would ask this Court to take judicial notice of the
laws of the State of Texas in that regard»

o

Or

One final reference to the Foster affidavit;

4

lower court, when the motion for summary judgment was heard, the

5

Government presented three affidavits to the court for its con­

6

sideration.

7

At that time I filed a motion to strike the affidavit from the

8

record on the basis that Commander Foster had arrived at the

9

misapprehension that he had paid a use tax rather than a sales

The District Court noted my objection, but did not

12

rule on that objection.

13

objection at this time and claim that the court erred in not rul

14

ing on the motion, and I would ask that this Court disregard the

15

Foster affidavit in its deliberations.

16

Under the circumstances, I renew that

1 would like to emphasize to this Court that this is a

17

case of first impression before the Court.

18

since the 1944 amendment to the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Re­

19

lief Act, no claim has been advanced that Section 514 encompasse

20

sales and use taxes.

21

22
23
24
25

In the last 25 years

It wasn’t until April of 1967, when this

case was filed in the District Court for the District of Con­
necticut, that the claim was made that Section 514 encompassed
sales and use taxes, so this is the first opportunity any court
has had to consider the issue.
It is the position of the State of Connecticut that
6

1

Section 514 was designed and intended by Congress to grant im­

2

munity to servicemen from property taxes, income taxes, and cer­

3

tain annual motor vehicle taxes in any State but his home State.

4

The statute accomplishes this by removing the juris­

5

dictional grounds for the imposition of those taxes, that is,

6

residence, domicile, and situs of the property.

7

The legislative history of Section 514, and the 1944

8

amendment and the 1962 amendment thereto, supports this position

9

In the legislative history of this section, and the clarifying

to

amendments -- and that is how they were characterised at the

It

time they were proposed to Congress, as "clarifying amendments",

12

not a broadening of the tax immunity already granted by Con­

13

gress —■ the committee hearings and the reports of committees

14

contained not one single reference to sales and use taxes.

15

ever, those committee hearings and the reports are replete with

16

references to income and property taxes.

17

How­

We submit to the Court that the silence of the commit­

18

tee hearings, and the silence of Congress as to sales and use

19

taxes, is indicative of the intention of Congress in this regard

20

It might be pointed out, too, to the Court, that in

2?

1940 the Buck Act was passed, which specifically granted the

22

States the right to collect sales and use taxes on transactions

23
24
25

taking place on Federal enclaves, so that Congress was well awar
of the sales and use tax phase of taxation at the time it passed
Section 514 and its amendments.
7

It is interesting to note that the District, of Columbi4
which is governed by a subcommittee of Congress , I understand,
has had a sa3.es and use tax on its books since 1949, a period of
about 20 years, and just two years less than the State of Con­
necticut has had its tax.
The Government in the lower court, and. in its argument,
and in this Court, is strangely silent as to the position taken
by the taxing officials of the District of Columbia in this re­
gard.

Certainly if any taxing officials in the United States

should be aware of the intention of Congress and the mood of
Congress, it would be the taxing officials of the District of
Columbia.
I think from the Government’s silence in this regard,
we can infer that the District of Columbia does not grant tax
immunity on sales and use taxes on the purchases of servicemen
in this area.
We submit that the lower court erred when it equated
a sales tax to a property tax in its decision.

The only reason

for equating it to a property tax was that the ultimate burden
of the tax ultimately fell on the consumer.

We submit that this

is true of almost any tax? that the ultimate burden will fall on
the consumer.

That is hardly a reason for equating two distinct

types of taxes.
The Court of Appeals compounded this error by followinj
the same reasoning.

We submit to this Court that a sales tax is

8

1

not a property tax and, conversely, a property tax is not a

2

sales tax,

3

a recurrent annual demand based on capital value of property;

4

whereas, a sales tax is based on the purchase price or is based

3

on the cost of acquisition or the purchase price of property,

6

and it is only taxed one time — the date of acquisition of that

7

property.

A property tax differs from a sales tax in that it is

A property tax is an ad valorem tax, and in 51 American

8
9

Jurisprudence at page 53, which is not in my brief, Section 26,

10

it states it very succinctly, and I would like to quote for the

11

Court;

12

"An ad valorem tax is a tax on a fixed proportion of

13

the value of property

14

assessed, and requires the intervention of assessors or

15

appraisers to estimate the value of such property before

16

the amount due from each taxpayer may be determined.,s

17

with respect to which the tax is

To that definition must be added that the statutes pro­

18

vide a means of appeal from the assessed valuation placed on

19

property by an assessor to a Board of Tax Review, and ultimately

20

to the courts.

21
22
23
24
25

So an owner of property, being assessed by a tax

assessor, has recourse to a Board of Tax Review and the courts.
The appellee concedes the difference between a property
tax and a sales tax in his brief at page 20, but he argues that
such difference should not be of real consequence in this case.
We strongly disagree.
9

1

At page 14 of its brief, also, it claims that Congress

2

intended that the tax exemption should be applied to any tax

With this we must also

The value in taxation, or the word ''value'* in taxation

It does

8

not have the same meaning as "purchase price" in sales taxation.

9

As stated earlier, in ad valorem taxation of property, a value

0

is placed on property by an assessor, who is usually a public

\

official, before the tax is levied, and the ower of property has

2

the right of appeal to a Board of Tax Review or to the courts

Each owns the same model and

For local property tax purposes, the tax

assessor places A*s automobile on the tax list at the value of
$2,000.

He places B’s car on the list at $4,000.

In this case,

B has recourse to the Board of Tax Review and the courts to have
his valuation of $4,000 reduced to equalise his base with A.
?

10

In the same manner, when A arid 3 acquired these vehicles;

2

A very well might have had connections in the automotive field

3

which allowed him to buy the automobile at the wholesale price

4

of $3,000. The sales tax would apply to the purchase price of

5

$3,000.
In the same manner, B, who didn’t have the same con­

6
7

nections, might have to pay the full retail price of $5,000. In

8

this case, the sales tax would be applied to the $5,000 figure,

9

and neither B nor A could complain about the price.

10
11

or

The tax is

the actual purchase price of property.
We submit that the Court should give short shrift to

12

the arguments of the Government in this regard.

13

in its brief, places great emphasis on the two leading cases

14

under Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors’ Civil Relief

13

Act which were decided by this Court.

16

Brodhead and California versus Buzard, both of which are cited

17

in all of the briefs submitted to this Court.

18

The Government,

They are Dameron versus

We submit, however, that rather than support the

19

Government's position, these cases support the State's position.

20

For example, in Dameron versus Brodhead, which involved an ad

21

valorem property tax on the property of a serviceman serving in

22

Colorado, he was a Louisiana resident at the time, this Court,

23

in striking down the ad valorem property tax stated, and I quote

24

from page 326 of the decision;

25

"In fact, though the evils of multiple taxation may
11

1

have given rise to this provision, Congress appears to have

2

chosen the broader technique of the statute carefully, freeing

3

servicemen from both income and property taxes imposed by any

4

State by virtue of their presence there as a result of military

5

orders»

6

original residence, whether or not that State exercised the

7

right*"

8

It saved the sole right of taxation to the State of

Again, in California versus Buzard, in which the issue

9

was the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of Capfc. Buzard for

10

driving an unregistered motor vehicle on the highways of Cali­

n

fornia, this Court, at page 387, opened its decision with the

12

following paragraph, and I quote again;

13

"Section 514 of the Soldiers* and Sailors* Civil Rs-

14

lief Act of 1940, 56 Stat, 777, as amended, provides a non­

15

resident serviceman present, in a State in compliance with

IQ

military orders with a broal immunity from that 5 :ate"s

17

personal property and income taxation*"

18

The two percent license fee which was involved in the

13

Buzard case was a substitute for an ad valorem property tax

20

which California had found difficult to administer, so .in both

2!

the Darneron case, which involved an ad valorem property tax,

11

and in the Buzard case, which involved a 2 percent license fee,

23

a substitute for an ad valorem tax, this Court emphasized that

24

it was dealing 'with an immunity granted by Congress from income

25

and property taxes.

12

i

Again, at page 393 of the Buzard decision, this Court
states, and I quote;

5

"The very purpose of Section 514, in broadly freeing

J

the nonresident serviceman from the obligation to pay

>

property and income taxes, was to relieve hint of the burden

;

of supporting the governments of the States where he was

f

present solely in compliance with military orders.

The

i

statute operates whether or not the home State imposes or

)

assesses such taxes against him."
Again the .reference is to property taxes and income

}

I

taxes.

The appellee, in his brief, places great emphasis on

this reference to the Buzard case, the latter statement concern-

I

ing income and property taxes.

j

26 of the first part of its brief.

.

leaves out the reference to income and property taxation, so

He quotes it at pages 12, 19, an 1
However, it conveniently

that the out-of-context phrase that is quoted, by the Government
at the top of page 12 is, and I quote,

"The very purpose of Sec­

tion 514* * *was to relieve* * *the serviceman of the burden of
supporting the governments of the States where he was present
solely in compliance with military orders."

The three asterisks

denote the deletion of the reference to income and property taxes.
At pages 19 and 26, the same out-of-context quote is
made,,

However, it is extremely interesting to note that at page

39 of the brief, which is the second part, which does not

13

1

subscribe to the arguments in the first part? a further referenc a»

2

is made to the case of Californici versus Buzard

3

case the quotation is given in full, so that the proper context

4

of the quotation is given, referring to income and property taxa ts o

5

,

and in this

In any event, we submit that the two cases leave no

6

doubt that the opinion of this Court was that the immunity

7

granted by Congress was for property and income taxes, and not

a

sales and use taxes.

9

At page 37 of its brief, in Note 27, the appellee ad­

10

vances a novel argument that servicemen who are furlough are no

11

longer absent from their home State by virtue of military orders

12

In effect, this means that a Texas serviceman, stationed in Con-

13

necticut, who is given a 3-day pass, as soon as he is given the

14

3-day pass, his status immediately changes so that he becomes

15

subject to sales and use taxes in Connecticut and any other Stat

16

that he might visit on his furlough, under the decision of our

17

lower court in this case.

18

At the end of his furlough, the mantle of tax immunity

19

immediately falls on his shoulders, and he again becomes immune

20

from sales and use taxes until he obtains his next furlough from

21

his commanding officer.

22

to an already confusing situation.

23
24
25

This, we submit, is adding confusion

The effect of the lower court decision, as we view it,
is to foster a discriminatory situation which we claim is, it- self, unconstitutional.

For example, California, at page 2 of
14

1

its amicus brief, states that there are 345,000 servicemen sta­

2

tioned at the various bases in California.

3

45,000 of the servicemen are California residents.

4

nonresident.

5

anywhere in California, the 45,000 resident servicemen are re­

6

quired to pay sales and use taxes, while the 300,000 nonresident

7

servicemen purchasing the same items for their personal use are

8

not obliged to pay sales and use taxes under the rationale of

9

the above decision.

300,000 are

General of these 34 States are competent to determine the effect

10

of the decision on tax revenues and tax administration in the

,

13

that the addition of just four words after the words "personal

property" in Section 514» that is» "or the use thereof»" clearly

shows an intention on the part of Congress to exempt servicemen

A

I was about to say, Mr. Justice Stewart, my pur-

you not?

3
6

pose here is to advance the arguments and support, the arguments

7

set forth in Part 1 of our brief, the arguments on behalf of the

8

serviceman.
As Part 2 of the brief indicates, the Solicitor Gen­

9
10

eral and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Tax

11

Division do not: subscribe to those arguments and are of the

12

view that the decision below should not be sustained.
Q

13

Well, there seem to be no fiscal views of the

14

Solicitor General and the Assistant Attorney General in charge

15

of the Tax Division.
A

16

I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the way to

17

put it is that we are here, for all practical purposes, as the

13

representative, in effect, as the guardian ad litem of the ser­

19

vicemen.

20

ments put forth in Part 1, and these are the arguments I pro­

21

pose to advance hers.

Q

This is how the suit was brought.

These are the argu­

Yes, but what I am trying to get at is, does the

Government support the serviceman or not?
A

I think this is a situation where the Government

wears, perhaps, more than one hat.
18

To the extent that the

1

Government's function is to formulate a litigating position on

2

behalf of the Department of Justice, which represents the United

3

States, as such, that, of course, is formulated by the Solicitor

4

General, taking, of course, the counsel of the Assistant Attorne /

5

General,

6

primary function is to advance a position of the United States,

7

as such,

8
9

But I do not think this is viewed as a case where the

Q

Mr. Weinstein.

Well, that depends on what you have just said,
The inference I draw from that is that the

10

Solicitor General, and the Assistant Attorney General's position

n

is the official position of the United States Government, and

'«2

that you just, on behalf of the servicemen, have responsibilities

13

under the statute to enforce rights of servicemen, but that the

14

official position on a legal issue is that expressed by the

15

Solicitor General.

16

A

Is that right?

Yes, I think that it is clearly the function of

17

the Solicitor General to formulate what you are describing as

18

the official position in this Court.

19

Q

So that is what we are to understand, then.

20

A

Yes, I think that i3 right.

21

Q

Mr. Weinstein, are there only two points of view

22

in the Department of Justice?

23

who have a third or fourth point of view?

24
25

A

Aren't there some lawyers there

I think the two views are. that the judgment below

should be affirmed, which I should like to advance here, and the
19

?
2
3
4

other view is that the judgment below should be reversed.
Q

In an oral argument, is anybody for the Government

going to present the view that it should be reversed?
A

No.

I third: that reliance is placed on Mr. Ahern

5

to advance that position, and I think that Part 2 of our brief

6

indicates that it is not intended as a complete development of

7

those views, but, rather, a summary of them, and principal re­

8

liance is placed on the briefs of the appellants and of

9

amici curiae on their side of the case.

10

11

Q

the

Well, is there a case in controversy now between

the United States and the State of Connecticut?

I think there is, Justice White.

A

Well, I think to the extent that my personal views

23

are pertinent, and I am not sure that they are, I support the

24

arguments I would like to advance.

25

Q

Mr. Weinstein, I want to hasten to say that I am
21

1

eager, and i am sure we all are very eager, to hear your argu­

2

ments, and your arguments are always very able and very cogent.

3

The perplexing problem for me is that we are here confronted

4

with a case which is rather unconventional, since we usually

5

have adversary parties*

6

there is a specific view of the United States which the United

States is advocating,

I believe that if the Court examines the briefs there,
the Court will find a comparable kind of situation,
Q

Is that a conflict within the Department of

Justice, because this apparently is a conflict within the Depart
merit of Justice*

It is not like a situation where partly or

wholly as a result of statutes, the ICC for example takes one
position, and the Department of Justice takes another.
A
ment of Jusfcie

I don’t think there is a conflict in the Depart­
in the sense that the officials charged with the

responsibility of formulating the position of Presidential
appointees are in agreement and their views are stated in Part 2
of the brief.

1

In the Kornhauser case* I will say the situation was

similar in this way:

of Justice and what I think was then called the Bureau cf In-

4

a brief filed in two parts.

Here we have no statement of the position of the

Department of Defense, do we?
A

No, but I think you have a position of the United

States in its capacity as representative of the servicemen.
Q

Who is their representative here?

It just seems

19

to me that this is an anomaly that we shouldn’t give furtherance

20

to, to have a Deputy of the Solicitor General come here and seek

21

to override the opinion of the Solicitor General as to what the

22

public interest is, and. ask us to follow the Deputy as against

23

the head of his office.

24
25

A

Now, that I cannot understand.

Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t think that the Solicitor

General assigned me to appear here with that purpose in mind.
23

1

As I understand my assignment, it proceeds from the Solicitor

2

General's view that this case should receive an adversarial pre­

3

sentation and the Court should have before it an adversarial

4

development of the arguments on both sides.

5

pose that the Solicitor General has assigned me to come here and

6

to present the arguments on behalf of the servicemen.

It is for that pur­

It is not that it is a matter of a deputy attempting

1

to override him? it is a matter of having been assigned to appea

Q

Well, if the United States had decided not to

1

come here at all, I suppose the Court might have been interested

z

in having this argument, anyway? is that your idea?

A

3

I should think so,

I should think it is com­

parable, as I said before, perhaps a step behind, but comparable

to a situation of a confession of error when you asked me, Mr.

The fact is that even if the United States offi­

cially agreed with Connecticut, there happens to be a judgment
of the court below, isn't there?

A

That is correct, Justice White,

2

Q

Mr. Weinstein, is it your submission that it is

neither necessary nor appropriate to push the statute beyond so

as to make it applicable to the ordinary retail sales tax and

5

the concomitant use tax now imposed by most of the States, end

of quote, on the last page of your brief?

7
8
9
10
11

A

That is the view that is expressed in that part

of the brief and it is not the view that I wish to support here.
Q

Is that in complete agreement with the Court of

Appeals for the Second Circuit and the petitioner?
A

No, that is in complete disagreement with the

12

Court of Appeals and in agreement with the appellants, with the

13

position taken by the State of Connecticut,,

14

Q

It is entirely opposite to the Court of Appeals.

15

A

The Court of Appeals ruled in this case in favor

16

of the servicemen.

The District Court ruled in favor of the

17

servicemen.

A

That is correct.

Q

Well, what do you want us to do?

4

A

I would like to be free to argue, if I may, that

5

the decision below should be affirmed, and present what we con­

6

ceive of as the arguments on that side of the case.

And you want it affirmed.

A

Myself and the other gentleman who are assigned

to work on this part of the case, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

You mean all of them from the office who worked

on it are against the Solicitor General?
A

I would like to think, Mr. Chief Justice, that is

14

not pertinent; that the pertinent thing is that in the view of t le

15

Solicitor General this issue should be developed before the

16

Court in argument in an adversarial way,

17

Q

Are we entitled to approach the case in this way:

18

that the Solicitor General of the United States, and the State

19

of Connecticut, both are of the opinion and are urging upon this

20

Court that the statute is constitutional, but that his deputy

21

argues that it is not, and we decide it one way or the other?

22

A

Mo, it is not.

23

Q

Why is that not fair?

A

Because the constitutionality question is the

24
25

other way around, Mr Chief Justice, and the basic issue is as it
26

1

has been argued below and as 1 would conceive it is not one of

2

constitutional law, but of interpretation of a specific part of

3

the Soldiers® and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act.

6

Q

The supremacy cla se would be involved, wouldn’t

it, if the Soldiers1 and Sailors3 Civil Relief Act applies to it?

Yes, of course, but my difference with you wasn’t

to the extent that Connecticut and the Solicitor General agree

8

that the decision should be reversed.

That Section 514 is an unconstitutional abridge­

Civil Relief Act.

19

A

That is correct.

Q

I thought you were talking about the Tax Act.

A

No.

There is no question here of the constitutio

The argument in. Part 2 of the Government's brief goes

He decided not to defend, and we assigned, as I re­

12

call it, Stanley F. 'Reed, Jr., to present the argument on that

13

side of the case.

4

I gather what you are saying to us now is that while

15

the Government's position, to the extent you have just related

IQ

it, is that expressed by the Solicitor General, you are in much

17

the same position on behalf of the servicemen that Mr. Redd was

8

in behalf of the servicemen in that case.

Is that it?

19

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

20

Q

And we didxi'fc appoint you, but —

21

A

Yes.

I also call the Court's attention to the

22

Tellier case, which I think was decided the same term.

28

My

hope here is to present only the one side , the one side that
has not been presented by Mr. Ahern.
Q

Aren31 we entitled to know what the Government

represents is the public interest in this case, and if so, I
again say, who are we to take that conclusion from, from the
Solicitor General, or from his deputy who appears here in the
nature of a friend of the Court?
A

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that the position of

the United States before this Court must be taken to be that
formulated by the Solicitor General.
Q

That is Part 2 of your brief.

A

I would think so; yes, sir.

Q

Which you argue against.

A

Yes.

Q

Why don't you go ahead as an individual and pre­

sent the best argument that you think can be put forward in be­
half of the servicemen.

I would like to hear that.

A

Thank you.

Q

I think we are entitled to know.

I don't think

the Government can eat its cake and keep it, too.

I think we

are entitled to know what does the Solicitor General's Office
represent as the public interest in this case?

If we take the

view of the Solicitor General, as we invariably do, as to what
the public interest is, by what right does his deputy come here
and say the opposite?
29

1

Now, if you appear as a friend of the Court, I would bo

2

perfectly willing to grant you permission to do that as an indiv:.

3

dual, but I don31 see how you can corne here and speak for the

4

Government as a Deputy Solicitor General, when the Solicitor

General himself has the opposite view and expresses it to this

Court.

Q

I understand what you are doing is representing

these people as a guardian ad litem, or whatever you choose to

call it, in putting forth the best arguments that you can muster

in support of their position.

9

A

10

Q

Isn’t that all there is to it?

Yes, sir.
Mr. Weinstein, I am sure you are going to make

11

every argument that can be made on the side that you are repre­

12

senting.

13

basic embarrassment is that I think this procedure presents, and

14

that is that servicemen might very well feel that this case has

2

A

I understand your concern, Justice Portas.

Perhaps

3

it ought to be made clear that, as 1 understand it, my assign-

4

rnent is to present that side, and in terms of one being a sub­

any difficulty except if I failed to present the serviceman's

side as well as I could.

Yes.

The Solicitor General, Mr. Justice Black.

A

Yes, sir.

I think the best discussion of our authority is

in the Fourth Circuit decision in United States v. Arlington

It isn’t until this Court, in Mr. Ahern’s argument

It
12

here, that he has been told that he didn’t have to pay both

14

this kind of situation; that it was intended to create a situa­

15

tion where the only jurisdiction which could tax a serviceman

16

in this position would be his home State.

The language that we are interested in here

20

I would suggest that the basic problem is whether the

21

language, or the policy, or the bases of the statute in any way

22

allow a distinction to be drawn between ad valorem taxation,

23

annual ad valorem taxation, which everyone agrees is forbidden

24

by the statute, and sales and use tax.

25

The starting place, I would suggest, should be the
35

1

language of the statute»

It refers, in its terms, to what is

2

called "taxation in respect of personal property."

3

would seem to be the broadest possible language.

4

valorem taxation.

5

specific type of taxation, but taxation in respect of personal

6

property.

Now, this
It is not ad

It is not seemingly restricted to any one

This would seem to catch any tax that has to do with

7
8

personal property that depends or is triggered by the existence

9

of personal property.

Any such tax under Section 514 is sup­

10

posed to be forbidden, except when imposed or exacted by the

11

serviceman's State of residence or domicile.
The way this mechanism works is to create what might

12
13

be called a fictional location of the serviceman’s personal

14

property.

15

State where he appears and is not a resident or a domiciliary,

16

in any State where he is taken solely by his military orders,

17

The personal property is deemed not to be in any

I don't think anyone has suggested exactly how this phrase can

18

be read in a way that would describe only ad valorem taxes, but

19

would not describe sales or use taxes,

20
21
22

23
24

25

I think this is particularly clear with use taxes.
Use taxes require the physical presence of property within a
taxing jurisdiction.

It can be imposed only when property is

used in the jurisdiction, and that cannot occur in the case of a
nonresident serviceman, because of Section 514.

His property

can never be deemed to be in a jurisdiction other than his home
36

1

State for purposes of local taxation

2
O

This is also true, I think, of sales taxes»

The Con­

vJ

necticut statute, which I think is typical, doesn’t just, as the

4

say, tax the privilege of a sale; the tax comes into being only

5

when there is a sale of personal property, and furthermore, it

6

only happens when possession of the personal property is taken

7

in Connecticut.
Under Section 514, that possession has got to be con­

8
9

sidered as taking place in the serviceman’s home State.

10

Q

Is that section printed in the brief?

1?

A

Yes, Mr. Justice Black; in our brief at pages 2

12

to 4, and also in the Connecticut brief, I think in the appendix

13

The particular language —

Q

What date was that brief filed?

A

The brief?

Q

A

Within the last three weeks, I believe.

19

Q

March 20th is your brief.

20

A

Yes.

21

That is my trouble.

A

The language of the statute is this, Mr. Justice

17

it.

25

I don’t seem to have

Black;

I don’t have it.

resident serviceman, shall not be deemed to be located or pre­

to be his home State and not the State where he goes on military

orders.

4

The situs of a serviceman's personal property is deemed

So the language and the mechanism of the statute don't

5

seem to allow any distinction between these types of taxes.

6

would suggest the same thing is true of the policies of this

7

statute.
The purpose of the statute, as expressed by Congress

8
9

I

and by this Court, was to avoid any real threat, any possibility

10

of double taxation by multiple jurisdictions.

11

this not by some manner of trying to find out which State should

12

grant a credit for the other State, which is the kind of thing

13

v;hi.ch has happened in Commander Foster's case, and has never bee a

14

really resolved? rather, the purpose of the statute was to leave

15

the sole function of the tax, the sole ability to tax, to the

16
17

home State, to the serviceman's residence or domicile.
^'
Q
In the case of a sales tax, supposing Connecticut

18

can collect this sales tax, what risk of double taxation is ther

19

in that?

20

A

I think,

It was to achieve

Justice Harlan, the risk of double tax­

21

ation comes out of the complimentary functions of the sales and

22

use taxations.

23

really separate taxes? they are. merged into one.

24

isn't so much a matter of raising revenue by itself, but it is

25

As the two courts below said, they are not
The use tax

a compliment and a means of enforcing the sales tax.

38

1

I would suggest that this is double taxation when a

2

serviceman buys a car in one State and is charged a sales tax,

3

and he goes to another State where he is then charged a use tax,

4

which use tax would not have been imposed if he had originally

5

bought the car in the second State and paid a sales tax,
Q

6
7

Would there be a use tax imposed on this trans­

action in the domiciliary State by the domiciliary State?
A

8

In one or two situations.

If, as Commander Fos­

S

ter tried to do, a serviceman seeks to register his car in his

10

home State, generally the home State will seek to impose a tax.
The other thing, which comes to the potential of doubl

n
12

taxation, which is also within the purposes of this statute, is

13

that ultimately, I would assume, the serviceman is going home.

14

When he goes home, he brings back his property with him, what­

15

ever he has acquired, and at that time he is going to be sub­

16

jected to a use tax on this property.

17

double taxation is almost certain.

This is the point at whicjh

I would suggest really in terms of potential for doubl

18

19

taxation, this ought to be compared to the structure of the ad

20

valorem taxation.

21

imposed any more frequently than the use tax and sales tax struc

22

tures.

23

switched from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within one year, and

24
25

Ad valorem taxation isn8t going to be doubly

It would really depend on the accident of a man being

being in one State on its ad valorem tax day, and then in anothejsr
State later in the year, or earlier, on its ad valorem tax day.
39

1

Q

Mr, Weinstein, do I understand that the basic

2

thrust of your argument is that since Congress has said that

3

possession shall be treated, as in the case of a serviceman's

4

personal property, as possession in his home State, that there

5

is not that possession, which is the incident upon which the

6

sales tax in Connecticut turns?

7

A

That is right.

0

Q

That is the basic thrust of your argument.

9

A

That is right.

10

Q

So double taxation and all the rest of it is

11

really quite irrelevant.

12

gress has said no, you have to treat his personal property as if

13

it were in Texas, his domiciliary State, whatever Texas may do

14

is Texas’ business as to sales tax, but in any event, Connecticu

15

can’t impose a sales tax because there is no possession of the

16

car in Connecticut.

17

A

If you are right about that, if Con­

That is our position.

I think that the other sid

18

argues that the phrase, the initial phrase of the statute, "for

1S

purposes of taxation in respect of personal property," means onlf/

20

ad valorem taxation in respect of personal property, and it doesh'

21

catch any other tax,

22

Q

What is the part of the statute on which you relyj?

22

Go back to .page 2 of your brief, because as I read that, it say

24

that "Such person shall not be deemed to have lost a residence

25

or domicile in his State solely by reason of being absent there40

1

from in compliance with military orders, or to have acquired a

2

residence or domicile in the other State.

3
4

S

Now, somev/here in that part of the statute do you find
support for your position?
A

In speaking of personal property, Mr. Justice

6

Fortas, I think there are two potential bases for imposing a

7

tax, and they are dealt with in two separate sentences here.

8

One is a tax that proceeds on residence or domicile and taxes

9

personal property —

10

Q

That is not applicable here? would you agree?

11

A

NO.

12

Q

What is the other one?

13

A

That is the first sentence, Justice Fortas.

14

Now, the sentence that begins on the top of page 3,

*

15

in the middle of the first line, which again begins "for the

16

purposes of taxation in respect of" and it doesn't say "person"

17

now, but "personal property, income, or gross income."
\

18

Q

Of any such person.

19

A

Of any such person.

20

Q

21

22
23
24
25

It indicates property, personal property owned by

the person, doesn't it?
A

Yes, and that would be, I think, a reference to

"any person" in the first sentence, perhaps modified, I suppose
modified by the language "a person being absent therefrom, from
his home State, in compliance with military or naval orders" in
41

1
2

the first sentence.
Then, as you go on in this sentence, first it describes

3

the source of income and says "Military pay shall not be deemed

4

to be from within the home State," and then for present purposes,

5

the language is "Personal property shall not be deemed to be

6

located or present in or to have a situs for taxation in such

7

State, Territory, possession, political division or district."

8

9

Q

Just reading that plainly, in the commonplace

manner, it does seem to support the State's position, rather

10

than yours, doesn't it?

11

depend upon doing a little magic with the words, doesn't it, in

12

taking what you deem to be the sense of the provision, rather

13

than its specific language,

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

A

In other words, your position has to

I think that whether that is so depends on how

the sales and use tax statutes work.

Use tax statutes are

applied only when property is within and used within —
Q

No, but a use tax in this sense, as I understand

it, is a part of a sales tax in the sense that it is ecmplir
mentary to the sales tax for the purpose of trying to plug what
would otherwise be an obvious hole in the sales tax.

Isn't that

the kind of use tax we are talking about here?
A

Yes, but the sales tax also depends on physical

presence of the property in the taxing jurisdiction.
Under the Connecticut statute, and while the language
is different in other States, the effect is the same.
42

The tax

1

is imposed only when there is a sale and when physical posses­

2

sion is taken in the taxing jurisdiction,

3

Q

Where is the legal instance of this tax?

4

A

This is the same kind of tax that was before the

5

Court last term in the Massachusetts bank case and it is a

S

vendee tax.

7

is given an action in debt and is directed to pass the tax on

8

to the buyer.

The legal incidence is on the buyer.

The seller

It is clearly a vendee tax,

9

Q

Cut the seller is directly liable to the State.

10

A

The seller is liable to the State.

11

liable to the seller.

12

labeled a vendee tax last term.
Q

13

The buyer is

It is the same structure as this Court

The tax purports, at least, to be imposed on the

14

transaction, doesn’t it, rather than on the property?

15

the transaction, the sale, measured by the value of the property

16

sold.

17

A

It is on

Well, it is imposed on the sale of, first,

18

tangible personal property.

19

but it is not just the sale alone.

20

personal property.

21

in the statute, in the Connecticut statute, in words that are

22

quoted in pages 28 and 29 of the brief here.

23
24
25

So it purports to be on the sale,
There must be tangible

The word "sale" and "selling" are defined

It says "mean and include any transfer of title, ex­
change or barter," and so forth.

Now, transfer of title, under

the general rule of the Uniform Commercial Code, which applies
43

1

in Connecticut * and I think almost all States by now, is the

2

title is transferred when the seller3s responsibilities as to

3

delivery are completed»

4

a concept of a transfer of physical possession»

5
6
7

So this definition of sale incorporates

So you can't view the sales tax as simply being on
some abstract privilege of selling.
Q

Well, not necessarily; that is to say, you could

8

have a transaction in Connecicut -- I have had some —• in which

9

there is no transfer of physical possession but the sales tax

10
11

is collected.
A

If there is no transfer of possession, if the

12

property is supposed to stay where it is, this brings into play

13

a different part of the Uniform. Commercial Code which would

14

transfer title at that earlier time.

15

talking here about movable chattels, boats, cars, appliances,

16

things of that sort, they are things that contemplate transfer.

17

20
21
22

25

Q

But I think where we are

What we are talking about here mostly, I think,

is food and drink.
A

Food and drink, under the stipulation, I think —

the stipulation says that everyday purchases are made in the
Post Exchange or Commissary, and those under the Buck Act, which

I think is Section 107 of Title IV, are explicitly exempt from
sales and use taxes.
Q

How about, is it stipulated here — I notice it

is stipulated, at least I think I remember it is stipulated --

44

1

that no attempt would be made,, that there is no opposition to

2

the collection of the sales tax with respect to groceries bought

3

in a grocery store in New London, for example, by a soldier.

4

What about that?

5

6

A

I didn't understand that to be in the stipulation.

I just understood that while —
Q

7

Is it the Government position that when a soldier

8

goes into a store in New London to buy a pack of cigarettes that

9

he is exempt from the sales tax?
A

If I can avoid the cigarette tax, which is a dif­

12

Q

I am talking about the sales tax on a carton of

13

cigarettes.

14

A

15

toothpaste.

16

Q

All right.

17

A

I think the position on this side of the case

10
1!

ferent —

I will take the sales tax on, say, a tube of

18

would be that the exemption applies simply because there is no

19

way of parsing either Section 514 or the Connecticut tax to

20

apply only to, say, big-ticket items and not to small ones.

21

Q

That is what I thought.

In short, your position

22

is that the sales tax ought not to be collected on a purchase

23

of toothpaste by a soldier in a store.

24
25

A

Yes.

I think the impact — I am saying that is

the thrust of the legislative judgment in this statute.
45

The

j

1

function of the stipulation, I think, is to show that that kind

2

of impact is not likely to exist because purchases of this kind

3

are not made in stores that are generally subject to the State

4

tax, but are made in official installations where the tax does

5

not apply.
Q

6

I think I remember in your opposing counsel5s

7

brief that Connecticut imposes a sales tax on the rental of hote ..

8

rooms.

Is that correct?
A

B
10

Yes.

I think whether that would fall under

Section 514 --

1?

Q

It hardly would fall under the language, would it‘*

12

A

I would like to start by saying I don11 think

13

that is in this case.

14

Q

At least it hasn't been up until now.

But I think counsel for the State makes that poinn

15

to emphasize his position that the tax is imposed on the trans­

16

action, rather than being a tax on property.
,A

17

I have struggled with the problem of how do you

18

characterize the right to occupy a motel or hotel room for a

19

night.

20

can characterise this right as intangible personal property.

21

it is, it would be exempt.

22

more in the nature of a real property interest, which would not

23

be caught.

24

different problem than these admittedly tangible items which have

25

physical location, that do move around, where a hotel room does

Under Section 514, the problem comes down to whether you

I suspect it isn't.

If

It seems to me

But whether that comes under Section 514 is a rather

46

1

notf and certainly seem to be the type of objects that Section

2

514 was intended to deal with»

3

There are other points that I think are adequately

4

covered in Part 1 of the brief, which is a discussion of the

5

Buck Act, the supposed administrative problem, and the consti­

6

tutional attack,, which I think this Court put to rest in the

7

case of Dameron against Brodhead some years ago,

8
9

SO
n

Q

Before you sit down, Mr. Weinstein, may I ask

you one more question about the matter we were discussing at
the outset of your argument.
I have looked at this Arlington case.

Apparently this

12

is the rationale of the Government's standing to bring the suit.

13

I am quoting from it:

14

"Here we find that the interest of the national govern-

15

ment in the proper implementation of its policies and pro­

16

grams involving the national defense is such as to vest in

17

it the non-statutory right to maintain this action.

18

these circumstances, the incapacity of the individual plain­

m

tiff to maintain his action is immaterial, since he may find

20

shelter under the Government's umbrella."

2?
22
23
24
25

Now, my question is:

Under

I gather the policies and pro­

grams of the United States when this action was brought were on
the side of the servicemen, and that would be the justification
and the defense as an issue of the right of Government to maintain the suit had been raised.
47

1

But now here, when you come to this Court, apparently

2

the Government5 s policies and programs have changed.

3

have a bearing on whether or not we have a case in controversy

4

before us?

5

A

Does that

1 would think that the existence of the contro­

6

versy — again, I would like to go back to confession situation,

7

because in the confession situation, the Government is clearly

3

saying "We don't think now, in a criminal case, this man could
have been prosecuted or should have been prosecuted in this way.

0

Q

No, but it seems to me, Mr. Weinstein, that by th

1

time it gets here, if there is a change of policies and programs

2

why isn’t this moot?

3

down the line that the whole action be dismissed as moot?

4

Government now no longer insists that it is enforcing its

5

policies and programs in this case.

6
7

8

A

Why don’t we just vacate it and direct all
The

The very least there is here is a controversy

between the servicemen and the State.
Q

I know, but there can't be in the Federal Court.

The individuals were dismissed here,

just as they were in this

Arlington County action.

:f

js

We have the same situation here that

its policies and programs, and now it is not.
A

The difficulty I have is in distinguishing betwee \\
48

1

this case, as I said, and I guess I am not adding anything new

?.

to what I said, in any instance of confession of error, I think

3

that what you are saying would lead to the route that if there

4

is a confession of error, that would moot the controversy.

5

tainly if the confession went to the propriety of the charge,

6

say, that was brought, as opposed to ~~
Q

No.

Cer­

As I see it now, I don't think it is any

issue of confession of error at all.

When

this got before the Court of Appeals, as I read that opinion,
they said only the United States can be hare, if the United Stat

can be here»

2

A

Are you talking about the Arlington County case?

3

Q

Yes.

4

A

I am sorry»

5

I am not certain of that.

I was confused,
I assume it is reasons simi­

6

lar to this case, where one man would not ordinarily have the

7

$10,000 jurisdictional limit.

8

Q

Yes.

$121 was involved.

9

A

But if I can just try once more on this analogy,

10

suppose a criminal charge is brought and the claim of the defen­

11

dant is that this charge is barred by the Constitution, and this

12

is the manner in which the case is litigated, and in this Court

13

there is a confession of error, to wit: a statement that it is

14

the then position of the United States that this charge is, in­

15

deed, unconstitutional.
Q

16

But there is no question in that case about your

17

standing.

13

are doing, and this statute is a matter between the State and

19

the serviceman.

20
21
22

23
24

25

The statutes give you the authority to do what you

In the criminal case, it is between the United

States and the defendant.

Just because the United States says

that they are confessing error doesn't necessarily mean that the
court has to accept that, or that there isn't any case in contro
versy.
A

It seems to me that the United States, which clean •ly

has a function as a guardian, for certain purposes, of servicemen
50

1

in that capacity would have a capacity that is different and

2

distinct from it's general position as sovereign.

So that is a separate rationale from the Arlingto

A

Yes-, but I think that it is part of that because

the serviceman's interest --

Q

Well, may I put it this way, Mr. Weinsteins

8

pose the position of the United States, when this suit was

9

brought in the District Court, was that which is now presented

10

to us by the Solicitor General, and that were to appear.

I would suggest the District Court and the Court of

19

Appeals jurisdiction has to be viewed in terras of what the sifcua

20

tion was at that time.

tainly, of this case if it came up through the State system, and

22

if you were to argue that the case or controversy has disappeared

23

as between the United States, I think in terms of this Court's

24

jurisdiction it still has to be considered in terms of the

existence of a capacity on the United States to appear as a

Which is only to say the issue is the standing of

the United States to maintain this suit in the Federal Court.

5

thing that developed after the decision in the District Court

and Court of Appeals.

problem in this case if what you are arguing to us was the posi­

9

tion or is the position of the United States Government.

But

10

this is an adversary suit between the United States and the

11

State of Connecticut and we come into this Court and we don't

12

have an adversary proceeding at all.

13

all on the part of the United States in this Court as to what it

14

believes the public interest is, or the rights of these veterans.

We have no arguments at

15

We have a contrary view, a view that, is the opposite

16

of what the Government says officially, and we close this case

17

without any argument at all from the Government as to why it

18

agrees with the State of Connecticut in this particular matter.

19

Isn't that a strange situation?

20

A

As I said, it is uncommon.

As I said earlier, I

21

do not think it is unprecedented.

22

is a, case that I might have cited that would somewhat better for

23

this purpose than the Kornhauser case, and perhaps I should have

24

cited it first, and I think this is Burnett against Northern

25

Trust Company, again a tax case, I believe, from the 1930's and
52

It occurs to me now that thers

it may be in 283 United States Reports.

I am not certain.

But this was a situation where the brief had one part

3

prepared by the Treasury Department and the other half by the

4

Department of Justice,, and the Treasury appeared to present its

5

case, although the controversy was as much there between the

6

Government and the taxpayer.

7

Q

But there is a different situation.

That is two

3

agencies of the Government.

9

is that the official position of the Government is that the

But here all we have, as I see it,

10

statute of the State is constitutional, and this is an internal

11

fight in the Department, and the Solicitor General, having taken

12

the official position for the Government, does not appear, and

13

those in his employ come here and argue the opposite way from

14

the way he comes out.

15

16
17

We are left without any argument at all on the part of
the United States.
A

I suppose the case would have been closer to the

18

Northern Trust situation if this case had been brought in the

19

name of the Secretary of Defense, as the Northern Trust case

20

was brought against the Collector of Internal Revenue.

21

Q

That might be different, but we have had that witi

22

the ICC, we have had the Solicitor General on one side and the

23

ICC on the other.

24

We have had it with a number of them.

25

because of an internal difference of opinion in the Department

We have had it with Selective Service recenti/.

53

But vie haven't had it

over the Solicitor General? although he states his opinion in

general terms, the deputy comes in here and argues against that

position»
A

5

I hope I didn"t characterize my function in that

way.

I tried to put it in terms of being assigned to come here

for an adversarial presentation.

A

No, I cannot say I did.

Then you are hardly giving us a balanced view of

There is no need of arguing it.

I think I have said what I can offer on this,

Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

It bewilders me and

Very well.
Mr. Ahern, did you have

anything further?
