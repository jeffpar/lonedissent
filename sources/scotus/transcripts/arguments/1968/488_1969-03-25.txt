MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Doris Daniel and Rosalyn

Kyles, petitioners? versus Euell Paul, Jr., at cetera.
Mr. Gallman, you may continue with your argument.
FURTHER ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. GALLMAN, ESQ.
AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GALLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
Yesterday we were discussing the Nixon farm which,
under the Pauls, was improved and became more of a place of
business, as we observed from the record.
With the advent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
\

Pauls chose to operate their establishment under the guise of
a private club.

As is evident from the record here, this was

rejected out of hand by the District Court.

It was not even a

serious question in the District Court.
It does have one surprising effect on the case, though,
that I think has followed it all the way through'.

If we look

at the record and the commencement of the case, we see that
counsel for the plaintiff, or for Mrs. Daniel and Mrs. Kyles,
intended a trial based upon the private club exemption of the
1964 Act.
This fell flat, to gain their point in this regard,
and thereafter I think the record reflects that adequate proof
was not brought in concerning the connection of this business
25

1

with commerce, so that the Act would apply.
Wow, the District Court took the view that, Number 1,

2
3

there was no coverage under the Act because this was not a place

4

of entertairanent.

5

exercise, or such as that, and not one where one is entertained,

6

and it assumed that perhaps some of the items at the place of

7

business had moved in interstate commerce.
Q

tion

It considered it a place of participation or

Mr. Gallman, do I understand it to be your posi­

as amicus representing the position of respondent in this

to

case that the private club exemption of the 1964 Act does not

11

apply here?

12

A

That is correct.

13

Q

Since that was the finding of the District Court,

14

affirmed by the Court of Appeals, first of all, that that find- ■

15

ing is erroneous,

16
17

IS
19

20
21

22

23
24

25

A

That is correct.

Q

So that is out of this case.

A

I believe so.

There was further the question of what connection the
so-called lunch stand, snack bar, or what have you here, had
with the establishment; that is, would it come under 201(b)(2),
a restaurant, cafeteria, lunchroom, lunch counter, soda fountain
and so on, principally engaged in selling food for consumption on
the premises.
The lower court felt that this business was one of
26

1

swimming, sunbathing, and so on, and that the food was strictly

2

incidental and not a major enterprise of the business.

3

rejected the idea that there were two establishments, so as to

4

say that under sub-subsection (4) that there was no covered

5

establishment that would bring the entire establishment within

6

the coverage of the Act.

It also

When this case got to the Court of Appeals, the reason

7

a

ing was not the same, so the Court of Appeals looked at the two

9

requirements for coversige under the 1964 Act? namely, the com­

10

merce connection or the offer to serve interstate travelers.
Now, again, I advert to the fact that the record below

1?
12

was not developed with respect to the offer to serve interstate

13

travelers.

14

that it could be inferred from the testimony of Mr. Paul that

15

they v7ould serve any white person without inquiring about their

15

origin, but there is no searching inquiry at all as to whether

17
10

[l
22

that is, would leave the interstate traveler to go elsewhere.
This really is, considering the geography of the mat­
ter, a remote and isolated lunchroom, if that is what we are
talking about.

It is some 12 miles from the city.

It is hard

to get to and, as I explained yesterday, hard to find.
The Court of Appeals then approached it from the

»3

14

It is true

19

There is simply no questioning about it.

standpoint of what did the record show with respect to commerce.
/

*5

I know that Court had in mind, just as the Assistant Attorney

27

1

General had here, that common sense-wise, the business must nave

2

some connection with interstate commerce, but are we dealing wit i

3

the question of whether there is sufficient connection in the

4

area for Congress to legislate, or are we dealing with the ques­

5

tion of whether, under the provisions of the Act, a substantial

6

part of the food served at the lunchroom, which is serves, has

7

moved in interstate commerce?
Now, there were four items mentioned

There was

The District Court, without any evidentia ry

He said that there some of the

ingredients obviously came from out of State, I am guraj, it is
a matter of common knowledge, but it is not in the record,
I am satisfied, or I feel my common sense tells me,
that this establishment sold cigarettes, that it sold candy,
that it sold some other items — gum, mints, and items such as
this — but it is not in the record.

As a matter of fact, the

record indicates the opposite.
So this is what we get to when we look for coverage

under the Act:

there would be a serious contest on the private club exemption,

11

No.

that clearly.

12

Q

They didn't have a liquor license.

13

A

No,

there is no liquor.

It is indicated that nc

Of course, Arkansas is a package-type State and

15

they cannot dispense liquor by the drink.

A

But this place has always been noted for no

13

alcoholic beverages of any kind.
So the Court of Appeals approaches this:
dissented in the Court of Appeals.

Judge Ifeaney

He wasn’t quite so sure that

Judge Mehaffey, the majority judge, was wrong about this lack o1
evidence concerning movement of the food in commerce.

He wantec

to look at some Arkansas statutes that permitted, or might be
used, to prevent so-called integration or admissions of Negroes
to this sort of place, as saying, "Well, there is an omnibus
2

1

enforcement act in Arkansas that might be used to prevent this

2

sort of thing, so we can say that this practice, this discrimi­

3

natory practice of the Pauls, resulted from State action»"

4

So he buttressed his disagreement with this conclusion

5

and contended, all the while, of course, that there was suffieie

6

evidence that interstate commerce had furnished the goods that

7

were sold in the lunchroom»
Now, the other question, I think, that, deserves coxniaen t

here is the question of what about this place of entertainment?

Here our record concerning the equipment used for

boating, and boating only did the evidence go to, is not clear

13

as to where that came from.

19

they had about a dozen boats.

20

I don't know what they are exactly, except I think they are the

21

kind where children get in them and they have some pedals they

22

push and the paddle in the rear of the boat makes it go.

that is what it is»

reason they ought to say that the entertainraen: here, these boat 3 o

We suggest that it is not anywhere near like the

20

that the evidence concerning movement with reference to amuse­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CONRAD K. HARPER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. HARPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
With reference to Mr. Gallman's last point concerning
the disposition of the Lake Nixon property, a rumor came to our
attention some time in December, after this Court had granted
certiorari, that the property had been disposed of? whereupon,
I called the former attorney for the Pauls, Mr. Robinson I be; lieve his name was.

He indicated he was not then their attorney.

His understanding was that they did not wish to pursue this case.

\

However, he recommended that since he didn't

know anything more, I might talk with Mrs. Paul and Mr. Paul.
So I took this extraordinary step of calling Mrs. Paul directly
and asked her whether she had, in fact, disposed of the property.
Her answer was no, that they thought it was under contract, but
the deal had not been consummated, and that is as much as I know.
That was as of late December 1968.
With reference to the other principal question I would
like to address myself to now, that is, the food that was sejrvec
at Lake Nixon, I think it is sufficient for this Court, if it
wishes, to undertake to look at this case the way it looked at
the case of Hamm

versus Rock Hill.

There, there was r»o evidence as to the origin of the
food involved, and yet this Court, in a divided opinion, or as
38

a. divided Court, undertook to say that the facilities in Hamm,
as well as the companion case, were in fact open to the public.
They were located in either a five-and-dime in South Ci.voli.na,
or in a department store in Arkansas, and that was suf Lcie-t,
the Court felt, to demonstrate that in the ordinary c-T
interstate connections could be shown as to the oric.n of the
food,,
We think that situation is particularly apt here be­
cause the District Court sitting at Little Rock, /ary close to
Lake Mixon, undertook to say that as far as he us concerned,
there was sufficient connection with interstate commerce to
demonstrate that some of the food, at least, fad originated out­
side the States»

'

Therefore, our position, of course, is that the case
is not moot,

and the complaint, 1 might mention in conclusion,

does run against successors, in addition 10 the Pauls.

I believe

that might be' the situation here.
I have no further comments, urless the Court has some
questions.
Q

Did the District Judge's conclusion that it did

involve interstate commerce rely on evidence or did it rely on
common knowledge?
A
dence.

With reference to the food, there was no evi­

What the Court found was that some of the ingredients

in the bread had originated outside of the State as far as he
39

1

was concerned, and ingredients in the soft drinks had similarly

2

originated outside the State, but there was no testimony with

3

reference to

4

Q

Which ingredients?

5

A

He did not specify ’which ingredients, although I

6

might indicate that on file with the Court are some 20 photo­

7

graphs of Lake Nixon, some of which show Coca-Cola signs.

8

may have had that in mind when he said "some of the ingredients

9

in the soft drinks originated outside of Arkansas."

I would like to point out to the Court that there is

4

an error in the printing of the appendix on page 50 which, if

5

not caught, could lead to a bit of ccr.fusion in along about the

6

tenth line where it is setting out tie provisions of Section 201

7

(c) .

8

It says "’(2) In the case if an establishment described
in paragraph {!)„'’

That should be ’’paragraph (2)” and that is

10

the important part of this, becausf if it is an establishment

11

described in paragraph (2) , and then also as covered in the fourth

12

paragraph as a combined establishcent, then that language of

13

201(c) applies.

14

It need only of:.er to serve.

May it please the Court., I would submit, with 100,000

15

people a year coming to this establishment, advertising three

16

nights a week on the radio station in Little Rock, with a

"It is probably true that some out-of-State people

I woild like to point to just a couple of decisions»

8

In a Ninth Circuit case in 1966, in which this Court denied

certiorari, 361 ?. 2d 567, Capital Insurance, that was an actior

involving automobile negligence at Guam»

The Ninth Circuit

II

Court said there that it is well known that the population, of

12

the territory, the military personnel and others, has been

13

unusually transient in its nature»
I submit to the Court that logic tells us that the

14
15

personnel at a military base are transient, and that it would

16

be easy to assume that far less than 50 percent of those people

Q

You are going one step further, aren’t you, and

saying that we have to assume, without any proof, that all or a
great many of the people who were in the military establishment
there were ''interstate travelers"?
A

Is that right?

I think, Mr» Justice Fortas, that logic would

tell us that when the Congress was drafting this particular
section, that they may have been focusing on interstate travelers
42

1

in the usual sense? that isf people who are traveling today

2

and tomorrow from one state to another.

here is its effect on commerce.

Q

Well, maybe; but on the other hand, Congress has

1

said what part of commerce it wants to be protected under this

2

Act, and so far as relevant here, it used che phrase "interstate

3

travelers”.

5

Am I right?

A

That is correct.

Q

And your submission, then, must be that we should

5

assume from the fact that, by assumption, people who are station­

7

ed at this base came up to Lake Nixo:<, that they were interstate

travelers.

that far.

I think, Mr. Justic* Fortas, my argument would gc
However, I would also /ubmit to you that interstate

travelers in the narrower sense, because of the fact there is
a Federal establishment there, are also in and out of that Air
Force Base, both private people serving the military government
there, military people passing through.

I think the point I am

trying to create, as I indicated yesterday, is that this isnst

is a main-Xine community and, thus, under the terminology "offer 3

4

its authority of applying common sense, come to the conclusion

5

that there were offers here to serve interstate travelers.

6

Q

This

Is it your argument here that every place in the

7

United States where there is an army encampment, that it must

8

be considered that if somebody serves them, they are serving

9

interstate commerce?

10

A

I wouldn91 put it, Mr. Justice Black, just that

11

flatly, but I think you have to look at some of the other cir­

12

cumstances surrounding the situation, also.

that there would be a small encampment of some kind up in Alaske

I don't think it taxes the logic to make the

19

assumption that where there is a Federal military establishment

20

that there are bound to be people traveling to and from that

21

establishment from someplace outside of the State.

2.2

is a reasonable assumption.

23
24
25

Q

I think that,

If you want to go as far as —

Why would you consider somebody bound to be

there traveling from outside of the State?
A

Because I would presume that the people who are

44

at that establishment are not residents of the State? that is,

2

the vast majority of them would be coining from other parts of

3

the United States.

ing on this mainly in your case?

No, I am not, Your Honor.

is an army encampment, that the places around it are serving
interstate commerce* alone.
A

As I indicated, I think there is more in this

particular case than that, but the reason that I can go that
far is because these are nonresidents of that particular State,
people on the Federal payroll, the community in which that en­
campment is located is getting the benefit of Federal spending^
and to me this puts it in commerce.
Q

What has that to do with interstate commerce?

Everybody is getting the benefit of Federal spending.
Q

Do I understand that, through advertising, there

was a direct solicitation of patronage from this military
installation?
A

Your Honor, that is correct, except I would want

you to understand that the ad does use, the ad which is shown
45

1

on page 88, does say ''Attention All Members of Lake Nixon.”

2

However, further in the ad it says "The Villagers play for the

3

big dance Saturday night and, of course, there is a jam sessson

4

Sunday afternoon.

5

That is Lake Nixon.

Also swimming, boating, and miniature golf,"

Now, I point out to the Court that the Pauls them­

S
7

selves admit that the membership provision was a sham and a

3

guise? therefore, everyone in the community knew that what

9

"Attention Members” meant, was "Attention White People" in the

community, and not Negroes.
