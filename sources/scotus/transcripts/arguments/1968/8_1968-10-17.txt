FURTHER ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRL B. BARIS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BARIS:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

3

Court, yesterday afternoon I was asked a question, I believe by

9

Mr. Justice Fortas.

In the press of the recess I didn't get a

10

chance to finish.

11

is necessary to be included in an affidavit for a search warrant

12

and with particular reference to the previous reliability of

13

informant.

14

It related to the information which I feel

I have here a handbook on the law of search and seisure

15

to be distinguished, of course, from the handbook by which we

16

are talking in this particular case.

17

I would say.

18

This is a legal handbook,

This was published very recently by the Government.

I note that on page 4, for instance, these are instrue-

19

tions to law enforcement officers as to what should be included ij31

20

an affidavit.

21

ant is undisclosed, it is necessary to back up the other person's

22

trustworthiness by showing prior dealings with him which were

23

reliable to back up your belief that the information he is now

24

giving you is reliable."

25

They say specifically on page 4, "Where the inform

z

particularly noteworthy, because these examples are based upon

information by reliable informants.

five times within the last four months.

Three of them, I think,, are

In the first one it says

Example No. 2 says informant has provided reliable

7

information about robberies on two occasions during the last

8

three months.
Example No. 3 says a reliable informant who has given

9
10

reliable information on narcotics offenses on three occasions

'11

within the last two months.
I also would like to draw the Court's attention to the

12
13

various cases decided by this Court in which there have been

14

information, supplied by informants.

15

cases where the search warrant has been sustained there is sub­

IS

stantially more than was included in the affidavit that we have

17

in the instant case and in those in which the search warrant was

18

not sustained, we have a comparable situation.

I think in each of those

For example, in the McCray Case* which was not a search

19

20

warrant case but an arrest without a search warrant, one of the

21

officers testified in support of his probable cause that he

22

received information from the undisclosed informant on 15 or 16

23

oases in the past which resulted in numerous arrests and convic­

24

tions.

25

ais informant on 20 to 25 occasions.

A second officer said he had received information from

-

11

-

1

In the Riggan Case, which was a per curiam decision of

2

this Court involving a search warrant and in which the search

3

warrant was held not to be good, it merely stated that informa­

4

tion from the sources believed to be reliable which I consider

5

to be very comparable to what we have here where they sais ,!a

8

confidential reliable informant."

7

In the Ventresca Case, a seax*ch warrant case in which
.

8

the search warrant was approved, there was no informant involved

3

but only Government investigators.

I think the Government inves­

10

tigators are in a different category than an undisclosed inform­

11

ant .

12

|

In the Beck Case, not a search warrant, b\it in which

13

the arrest and the subsequent search was held to be invalid, the

14

officer had information, but there was nothing said in his testi­

15

mony concerning the credibility of the informant.

16

In the Aguilar Case, the search warrant or the applica­

17

tion said, "reliable information from a credible person," which

18

I think is practically what we have in this case.

19

search warrant was held to be not good.

20

Again, the

In the Rugendorf Case, involving a search warrant, there

21

were three informants.

22

had found to be reliable or who had furnished reliable informa­

23

tion to the FBI in the past or who had supplied the FBI with

24

reliable information in the past.

25

As to each of them it says whom the FBI

In the Kerr Case, not a search warrant case but involving
12

-

I

probable cause on an arrest, the informant had previously given

2

information leading to at least three arrests.

3

In the Jones Case, the second Jones Case at 362 U,S.,

4

the informant gave information on previous occasions which was

5

correct„

6

search warrant was sustained in that case„

That case was reversed on other grounds, although the

In the Draper Case, which was relied upon heavily by

7

a

the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case and

9

which is relied upon by the Government in their brief, there was

10

a special employee of the 1?BI who had been serving four to six

n

months and had previously given information which was found to be

12

reliable.

13

Upon the authority of those cases, it is my conclusion

14

that merely to say that the informant is a reliable confidential,

15

informant does not satisfy the requirements of the probable

16

cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment»

17

In addition to the other reasons which we have alleged

18

and indicated in our brief and which we discussed yesterday, I

19

feel also that the search warrant here was improper because the

20

affidavit did not relate the time when the alleged informant

21

gave this information to the Government nor when he allegedly

22

obtained this information»

23

There is a case of the United States Court of Appeals

of the First Circuit, the Rosencram; Case cited in our brief,

12

We have also indicated two other points in our brief,

13

me with reference to the fact that more items were seized than

14

;he search warrant required.

15

justify the seizure of a pencil sharpener, a radio, and adding

16

machine, a watch, eye glasses all under the general heading of

17

'gambling paraphernalia.

18

The Court of Appeals seemed to

ground of gambling paraphernalia makes it a general warrant and

20

.s improper.

22

23

:wo telephones are two telephones, but the other three telephones

25

In fact, we are in the anonymous situation that the
They

With reference to a final point that we have brought up
-

14-

1

in our brief, that is, with reference to the execution of the

2

search warrant.

3

after the agents received the search warrant, they apparently

4

went back to their office for a certain mechanical equipment and

5

walky-talkies apparently, and then, went out to the scene of the

6

search.

7

entrance into the premises, they went to an apartment next door

8

and waited from 4:55 in the afternoon until 7:05 in the afterrioor

9

a period of two hours and ten minutes.

The facts in this case are that immediately

But instead of breaking into the premises or obtaining

They, insofar as the record shows, did nothing during

10
11

that period of time except to wait and when the petitioner exited

12

from the subject apartment, they then came out of the apartment

13

next door and which was right across the hall, and immediately

14

placed the petitioner under arrest, and then by virtue of a key

13

which they obtained from his possession went into the subject

16

premises.

17

It is our belief that this is not forthwith execution

18

of a search warrant as is required by Rule 4, that “forthwith"

19

means under these circumstances immediately.

20

course, there is the provision in Rule 4 that a search warrant

21

must be executed within a period of ten days after it is issued.

22

Otherwise, it loses its validity.

23

the officers have the search warrant, were at the premises, had

24

everything available to them for getting into the premises, inclu 3

ing the right under Section 3109 to break the doors, that they

Q

We have found no case which directly is in point wit

Do you claim that this delay indicates that the officer;

are not relying on the search warrant, but on search and arrest?
A

I don't know, Your Honor.

They have not attempted to

1

11

justify it on that basis throughout this case.

12

they were giving themselves an opportunity to do so if the Govern­

13

ment decided to do that on the basis that the search warrant wouljd

U

be held invalid.

I think perhaps

I am merely speculating as to the Government's position

IS
10

Perhaps they were giving themselves an ace in the hole, so to

17

speak, that if the search warrant were declared to be invalid,

18

then they would have as an alternative the question of an arrest

19

and a search incidental to the arrest.

20

Q

Did they make a return on the warrant?

21

A

Yes, they did make a return on the warrant.

22

It is our position, therefore, that the search was not

23

executed forthwith and that the burden is not upon the petitioner

24

to show prejudice, because the burden is not on the petitioner tc

25

show prejudice in incidents where, for instance, under the Wong

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. CONNOLLY

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. CONNOLLY:

9
'10

Mr. Connolly?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case is whether the United States

Commissioner reasonably found on the fact contained in this affi­

13

14

Indian Circle Drive.

16

statement failed to supply certain information which also would

17

be relevant to the Commissioner^ finding of probable cause.
By adding up the alleged deficiencies, petitioner con­

18
19

Petitioner's argument proceeds by separat­

cludes that there was no probable cause.
But that analysis is not fully responsive to the ques­

20
21

tion here.

The prior inquiry is not what the affidavit did not

22

contain, but what it did contain, whether there were enough facts

23

on which the Commissioner could make his own independent judgment

24

of the grounds for his search and whether that judgment on the

25

affidavit taken as a whole was reasonable.

17

-

-

1

Cause for reversal lies not on whether a judge on review

2

would not have issued the warrant because of absence of certain

3

particular information, but whether there was such a complete lacik

4

of information that the Commissioner’s apparent finding was nothirjg

B

raox'e than a rubber stamp to the police.

Petitioner's counsel has discussed what

did not contain, but I would like to set out briefly what it

question;

Mr. Justice, the affidavit, first of all, didn't say

16

that the apartment at 1108 Indian Circle Drive was his apartment.

17

From the face of the affidavit, it appears that he lived in Illi­

18

nois, came over to St, Louis.

ID
20
21

Q

His apartment, whether he lived there or not, what is

there incriminating about that?
A

The incriminating aspect of it, Mr. Chief Justice, is

22

that that apartment contained the two telephones specified by

23

the informant, that he was a known bookmaker and that a known

24

bookmaker making regular visits to an apartment 'with two tele­

25

phones itself provides some suspicion.

3

you get back to that one. fact to support your affidavit?

4

A

Don't you get to that?

Mr. Chief Justice, the petition correctly points out

j

5

that the finding of probable cause does depend upon there being

6

adequate assurance of trustworthiness of the hearsay information.

7

In Jones v. The United States

the Court held that a

8

valid affidavit may be issued on the basis of information suppilet

9

by an unnamed person as long as there is a reasonable basis for

10

II

corroborating the hearsay.
In the Jones Case the Court found a reasonable basis

12

for corroborating the hearsay in the officer's statement that the

13

informant had previously given accurate information, that his

14

story was corroborated by other stories of information and that

15

the suspect was known by the police to be a user of narcotics.

16

Petitioner relies heavily on the Aguilar Case, the

17

subsequent case in which the Court considered the

18

say "presumed to rely on hearsay information," because there is

9

A

Yes, it does.

10

Q

Why don’t you stay with it?

11

A

Mr. Chief Justice, to go back to perhaps the source

12

of the statement in the handguide, legal search and seizure, is

13

that the requirement in Aguilar that there be some underlying eii

14

cumstances to justify believing the informer was generally

15

reliable, I believe, is misconstrued by petitioner.

16

nothing in the Aguilar Case

Q

You are talking about the Aguilar Case.

There is

I am talking

18

about your own bulletin that tells your people what they ought tc

19

20

A

I will take off from my own bulletin.

Suppose the

2!

informer is not an informer with whom the agents had had any

22

prior dealings at all.

23

Q

Couldn't he say that he is a businessman in the com­

24

munity who had a good reputation and was a resident and this man

25

has told him that this is true, he is investigated and he knows
-

23

-

?

2

that his word is reliable and so forth?
A

They could put that in, Mr„ Chief Justice, although I

3

think there rarely would be situations in which a businessman or !

4

a bank president or someone like that would be getting informa-

3

fcion about gambling»

6

Q

j

Suppose they just don't know?

Why do you say that, that a good citizen and a business

7

nan might not do such a thing?

Suppose he had an apartment in

8

the same building and he didn't want gamblers to be in there and

Would that be abnormal?
No, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

Mr. Justice, I think there would be a very natural reserj-

Two telephones?

Q

What, are those?

Isn't it relevant circumstances that there are two

telephones among others?
Q

Quite relevant, but from what facts do you deduce or

8

is it reasonable to conclude there is gambling going on at that

9

address?
A

Because the informant has said that gambling is going

u

on through the use of two telephones, because the two telephones

12

are both in operation and are both at this address.

13

Q

It is that statement about gambling?

14

A

If the Justice is referring to the statement in Aguilar

15

which says that there must be some showing of the underlying cir­

cumstances on which the informant based his statement, is that

17

the part of Aguilar that the Justice is referring to?

I am talking about the part of Aguilar that refers

to the underlying circumstances, yes.

Wa admit that there is nothing in this affidavit which

meets that particular requirement in the Aguilar formula.

But

22

in response to your question, I would like to say two thingss

23

In the first instance, Aguilar itself established the

24

basis for a material distinction between this case and Aguilar.

The

Do you think all that is necessary, then, is that the

police somehow support the veracity of the informer?

7

I think that is what you are arguing, that as long as

8

someone's information has been verified, that proves that he is

9

a reliable person and, therefore, we may accept his blank state­

10

ment that there is gambling going on without any reason or with­

11

out necessary explanation as to why he thought gambling was going

12

on?

13

A

In the first place, that is what the footnote in Agui­

14

lar seems to say.

15

situations — I can't think of any right now — can a surveil­

16

lance supply the deficiency which we are talking about right now.

17

That is, that the affidavit doesn't tell you how the informant

got his information.

What is so difficult?

There must be some practical

reason for the Government not saying in their affidavit, the

22

informant said he saw gambling, or some other circumstance?

24

suggests that the only satisfactory showing of the underlying

circumstances in which the informant gained his information was

I agree with that»

Is there some reason why the Goverr. -

meat doesn't make the affidavit say what the source of the inform­

5

A

Just as in the casas in which the Government chooses

6

not to identify the informant by name, there is some risk that

7

the circumstances in which the informant gained his information

8

will serve to identify him and that there may be incriminations

9

against him.

10

To go on with our discussion, I would also like to

point out that the information in this case, that is, the intrin­

12

sic facts of the hearsay information, deserve some weight.

13

are not really an empty vessel that are given probative value on]y

They

The informant told the agents the type of glambling

16

activity petitioner wa3 carrying on, the way it was being con­

17

ducted and specific telephone numbers being used.

18

From our reading of Aguilar, we believe that the pri­

19

mary concern which prompted the Court to require some of the.

20

underlying circumstances surrounding the informant's acquisition

21

of his knowledge was the concern that an individual's unfounded

22

or ill-founded suspicion could be endowed with the appearance of

23

fact merely because that individual appeared in the affidavit as

24

a reliable informant rather than as the affiant himself.

23

We think that that risk is substantially reduced in
28

1

this case because the details of the information showed a workinc

2

familiarity with the way petitioner carried on his business.

details greatly reduced the risk that the information was the

product of the informant's own suspicion.

of those questions,

May 1 call your attention to page 27 of the record.

A

Yes, sir.

Q

It is implied at least on page 5 of your brief that

whether or not they knew that that is anybody's residence, they

certainly knew it was not his residence because on the fourth

line on page 5 you say, in stating the facts, they saw him

depart in the late morning from his residence in East St. Louis,

8

Illinois, and drive to St. Louis, Missouri, and in the afternoon

enter an apartment building and so on?

10

A

Yes, those are the facts, Mr. Justice.

The only reason

11

I was hedging is that the affidavit picked him up not at his home,

12

but as he was starting across the east side of the bridge into

13

St. Louis in the morning.

So I have in order to defend the affi­

The references on page 5 of your brief, pages 58, 59,

70 and 71, that is the original record rather than the appendix?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.
If the Court please, I would like to try to tie up our

21

argument with respect to this affidavit and the trustworthiness

22

and hearsay by referring to the policies enunciated in this

23

Court by the Court in United States versus Ventresca.

24
25

The Court's opinion by Justice Goldberg, who was the
author of the opinion in Aguilar, stated that where the affidavit
33

-

-

1

sets out facts where the magistrate can make an.independent

2

determination on the ground for search, the Court cannot set as xc

3

the magistrate's finding of probable cause by interpreting the

4

affidavit in a hypartechnical rather than in a common sense

5

manner„

6

The Court recognised in Ventresca, as it did in Jones,

7

that the circumstances under which affidavits are normally drafted

8

by policemen in the mid-city of a criminal investigation without

9

assistance, that the affidavit is found to leave some questions

10

unanswered.

11

which might have occurred to the Commissioner.

12

bean more confident if he had been told to the extent which the

13

informant had been provided information in the past.

14

been curious as to whether the agents who have been able to deter­

13

mine the volume of calls or where there were other questions.

The affidavit hare does not answer all questions
He would have

He may have

IS

But the teaching of Ventresca is that the affidavitfe

17

failure to supply certain facts is fatal only if it undermines

18

the reasonableness of the inferences which may be drawn from the

19

facts which the affidavit does — or put another way, only if the

20

inferences rest too heavily on the officer's good faith rather

21

than the magistrate's own independent judgment.

22

The critical issue in this case is the trustworthiness

23

of the hearsay.

24

provided the basis on which the Commissioner could find the

25

hearsay trustworthy without relying on the agent’s good faith.

The corroborating information in the affidavit

34

-

-

1

The reasonableness of that finding is not undermined

2

by the defects which petitioner alleges.

3

also cautioned that a grudging or negative attitude by reviewing

4

courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers

5

from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.

6

The Court in Ventresca

The concern which prompted that statement, I believe, is

1

illustrated by the facts of this case.

8

Binder did have at least a reasonable option to decide whether tc

Q

The affidavit here does show surveillance by the FBI?

It does.

13

Q

In Aguilar, there was no surveillance by the FBI shown

14

by the affidavits, is that right?

IS

A

The affidavit showed no surveillance.

16

Q

The Court in footnote 1 to which you have referred did

17

emphasize that point?

A

Yes, sir.

Suppose they have it under surveillance for a month and

No, Hr. Chief Justice.

I believe the footnote 1 in

tiad been presented to the magistrate, it vvould have been a dif­

25

ferent case.

Mr. Connolly, I think you do read that this one agent

15

:hafc the narcotics were where they were claimed to be?

16

A

That's right, Mr. Justice.

Q

Is it sufficient in that case?

You claim that the

18

ffidavit is good, that the informant is shown to be credible and

19

eliable?

20

A

We think the affidavit is good on the basis of the poli

ies of the entire line of cases in this area.

.22

Q

I take it that that is to be followed and be overruled?

Yes.

3

attempting to supply one element of a Federal offense, the inter­

4

state travel..

5

Q

What actually happened here is stated by the Government

3

on page 4 of its brief»

7

But the Government says that what actually happened is that

a

agents in another apartment overheard a bookmaking operation bein g

9

conducted over the telephones in the apartment in question here.

That was not set out in the affidavit»

to

They allege that this was not assisted by any mechanical amplifi­

11

cation.

Somebody had very good ears in this.

12

A

They said there were no carpets in

the apartment.

13

Q

Then thereafter they conducted a surveillance for

14

about three weeks.

What the affidavit does here is to pick up

15

the point of surveillance and it talks about the interstate

16

features of petitioner’s activities and it does surveillance in

17

the interstate activities, and then it has the information in it

IS

about the telephones that may not be meaningful — the reputa­

S3

tion of the petitioner which may or may not be meaningful — and

20

that is about the sum and substance of it.
But whatever that may add up to in one1s mind, it cer­

21

22

tainly is a great deal more, I should think,

23

gation and the naked statement of the search warrant in Aguilar.

24

A

than the naked alle­

I compare Aguilar with this case on the basis of the

meat of the informant’s information.

The informant in Aguilar

1

and the informant here was the only indication of any illegal

2

conduct on the part of the defendant in each of those cases,

3

I would say that the other information about his travels

4

is certainly not illegal unless it is combined with other illegal

5

conduct.

6

was merely a state violation and did not supply all of the elemers fcs

7

of the alleged Federal offense.

0

But we have a situation where what the informant said

The other elements of the alleged Federal offense came
in from this surveillance showing his interstate travel, but ther

m

was nothing to tie those two in as part of a Federal offense,

ii

and nothing to corroborate the surveillance, on the one hand, and

12

the informant's information, on the other hand.

13
14

They were completely disjointed.
Q

It comes down, I suppose, to a question of how strict

15

the standards for probable cause in an affidavit must be under

16

the Constitution in order to justify the issuance of a search

17

warrant.

10

nore difficult than Aguilar.

1

A

But perhaps this case does present a problem that is

Yes, I will agree with Your Honor on that.

Also I beli< ;ve

20

this case does involve an extension of the Aguilar rule, but. in

21

ny opinion, based on the Aguilar and other cases, this is a logi­

22

cal extension of the rule of the Aguilar Case.

23

Q

Suppose a defendant had been put on trial and the Covers

24

nent had put them on the stand and there had been a challenge to

25

iis reliability and character.

Could the Government had offered

particular instances of the past to show that he had beer, truth- 1

ful?

A

I would think that on the question of the admissibility

of such evidence at the trial, it would not be admissible.

S

Q

It would not be admissible, so that is not the way you

8

prove reliability.

7

knows it?

8

A

You prove it by a statement of somebody who

At the trial, if that became an issue, yes, sir.

In

9

this instance, I might point out that the man who made the affi­

10

davit had not had any contact with this alleged reliable inform­

11

ant.

12

cated.

13

Q

His contact was with another agent who, in turn, communi. I
1
What you have here is whether the Government, in order i

14

to show probable cause when it has somebody that just testifies

IS

that he believes this man to be of good character, is it neces-

16

sary for the Government to go further in the probable cause case

17

than it would in a trial case?

IS

A

|

I believe the Government is under that requirement.

I I
'i

19

think on the issue of probable cause there is a more basic issue j

20

than what appears at the trial.

21

Q

The basic issue is guilt or innocence, .isn't it?

22

A

At the trial, it is, Your Honor, but I think in the

23

Commissioner's state the basic issue is one of probable cause.
(Whereupon, the above-entitled oral argument was con­

24

25

cluded.)
