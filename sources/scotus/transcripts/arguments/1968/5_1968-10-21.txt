ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. GOLDSTICK:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR . CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

MR. GOLDSTICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this is an appeal from a conviction of the Criminal
Court of the City of New York wherein appellant was convicted
for malicious mischief in that he defiled and cast contempt
upon and burned an American flag in violation of section 1425
(16)(d) of the New York State penal law.
The charge was that he did willfully set fire to and
burn the American flag and shout, "If they did that to James
Meredith, we don’t need an American flag.”
The judgment has been unanimously affirmed by the
Appellate Term of the Supreme Court of the State of New York
and in turn was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals,
2

1

Judge Fuld rendering the opinion.
The statute in question is set. forth on page 5 of

2
3

appellant's brief.

4

completely with Justice Fuld when he states that the central

5

issue in this case is whether or not the deliberate act of

6

burning an American flag in public as a protest may be punished

7

as a crime.
Parenthetically, we believe there is another issue

0

0

I might at. the outset say that we agree

that was raised then and we raise here today that assuming that

10

New York State may punish such an act as a crime, may it do it

1!

under the statute in question.
The facts are really undisputed.

12

On June 6, 1966,

13

at about five-thirty in the afternoon, Sidney Street was sitting

14

in his apartment listening to the radio and he heard a news

15

broadcast that James Meredith while marching through Mississippi

IQ

was shot.

i

He went to his drawer, took out an American flag,
went out of his apartment, to a street corner, put a piece of
paper on the street, holding the flag in one hand properly
folded, put a match to it and set it on fire.
A police officer testified at the trial that he saw
the smoke, came over to find out what had occurred, saw on the
street corner a flag partially burned and folded lying on the
ground, heard a man shouting -— he couldn't quite make out what
he was saying at the other street corner across the street,
3

1

heard a man shout, "We don't need no damn flag."

2

identifying who the man was who turned out to be the defendant,

3

he asked him if it was his flag, the appellant said, "Yes, it

4

was my flag," and he said the words, "If they did that to James

5

Meredith, we don't need the American flag."
Q

6

Upon

Mr. Goldstick, Judge Fuld, in his recital of

7

the facts in his opinion for the Court of Appeals, does

8

have a little minor error in his factual recital, does he not.,

9

when he says that your client told the small crowd which had

10

collected that, "if they let that happen to Meredith, we don't

11

need an American flag"?
A

12

Well, we don't know if there is a factual error

13

there or not, and I will tell you why, Mr. Justice, because

14

the officer testified that he came over after the burning and

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

that he questioned the person there at the street corner.
Now, I don't know whether when he questioned him, if he
questioned him loud enough for the crowd to have heard the
questions.

I think we may assume that he did.

Certainly, we

may assume that the crowd did hear, "We don’t need no damn
flag."

That is without question.

record just isn't quite clear.
Q

The other words, the

You are quite right.

No, I went through the record pretty carefully

yesterday, and I didn't see that there was anything to support
the statement that your client, as he was burning the flag,
told the small crowd, before the officer came, told the small
4

1

crowd that had collected

2
3

A

Oh, that is quite right.

after the burning was done.

4

Quite so.

The statement was made
Quite so.

Let me ask the Court if they will turn with me to

5

page 5 of my brief so that we may examine the statute together,

6

and that I might point out what appellant3s contentions are

7

concerning the infirmities of the statute.

8

I turn to the subdivision (d), in which it says,

9

"Shall publicly mutilate, deface, defile, or defy, trample

10

upon, or cast contempt upon either by words or act..."
At the outset, it becomes obvious that the insertion

11

12

in the statute "by words or act," shows us that the statute on

13

its face restricts freedom of speech.
Secondly, I would like to point out that the words

14
15

"cast contempt upon," the word "defile," the word "defy,"

16

have speech meaning as well as act meaning.
As a matter of fact, I find difficulty in seeing

17
18

19
20

2!
22
23
24
25

where this statute does not on its face have an absolute
restriction on the form of verbal speech that somebody may use
towards the American flag.

And this is borne out, I might say,

in the district attorney's brief in which he so interprets the
statute.

Even in the Court of Appeals decision.

I ask the

Court to turn with me for a moment to Judge Fuld's decision on
page 8 of the record, about 12 lines from the bottom of the
page.

We see the observation by Chief Judge Fuld that
5

i

subdivision 16 of section 1425 is designed to prevent the

2

outbreak of such violence by discouraging contemptuous and

3

insulting treatment of the flag, and I infer from the word

4

"treatment," that certainly eontemputuous treatment of the

5

flag may be by word as well as by act.

6

opinions of the Attorney General of the STate of New York as

7

cited in the District Attorney’s brief seem to indicate that

8

the statute is prohibiting words as well as acts.

9

seems to go farther even than the Court of Appeals decision.

We find that the

In fact it

10

The Attorney General seems to feel that all

disrespect, of

11

any kind, shown to the flag is illegal under the statute.

12

Now, the point that I am trying to bring to the

13

Court's attention is that this is not a fanciful observation.

14

The convictions that we have had in New York over the past two

15

years are very real.

16

conviction in the Radich case that is waiting appeal in the

17

New York Court of Appeals, where an owner of an art store

18

displayed in his art store and in the window some 40-odd

19

constructions of an artist's protest against the American flag.

20

And as Judge Basil observed

in his dissent, the artist is

21

conveying by his pictures

what you or I might be able to

22

convey by words, but that this is the way he can convey it

23

best.

Besides Street's conviction, we had a

24

You will notice in our reply brief we have a picture

25

of a poster, and I notice that Mr. Justice Stewart is taking a
6

1

look at it, and I think that all of us should take a look at

2

it together,

3

for violation of the statute for showing an American flag in a

4

bookstore window and replacing on the field where the stars are

5

the doves of peace and the signs of peace.

6

Two weeks ago a police officer issued a summons

Now the question has to b® asked, "All right, what

7

does that have to do with this case?"

There is no question that

8

Street did something that isn’t all speech.

9

speech, and, all right, suppose the statute goes too far, but

It is act as well

10

we should still be able to convict Street because, unquestion­

11

ably, New York has the power to outlaw this kind of conduct.

12

It is our position, Your Honors, that even if this Court took

1.3

that position, which we do not agree with, but assume for the

14

moment that we agreed that the State of New York could outlaw

15

this type of conduct.

16

Q

Do you really argue that the STate of New York

17

could not constitutionally outlaw the defacing of the flag by

18

physical acts?

19

20

A

I do not, Mr. Justice Fortas.

I do not take

that position.

21

Q

You don't take that position?

22

A

I do not.

23

Q

It is the speech element here that, or the

24
25

so-called symbolic speech, that bothers you here?
A

It bothers me very much, and it also bothers me

7

3S

1

that a statute on its face is so restrictive gaesfar beyond the

2

limited powers that Mr. Justice Fortas is referring to, and tha

3

even if we assume that it could do what Mr. Justice Fortas says'

4

I quite agree with you, in all likelihood it probably could—

5

it can't go as far as the statute, and Mr. Street is in a

6

position to attack the statute.

7
0

Q

Mr. Goldstick, I didn't quite understand.

What

position do you not take?
A

9

I do not take the position that the State of

10

New York cannot regulate conduct towards the flag.

11

that the State of New York may in certain circumstances with a

12

properly drawn statute narrowly construed for the purpose

13

intended prevent certain acts of flag desecration.

14
15

I am saying

Q

I didn't understand your brief to take that

Last night I really struggled with this problem

position„

16

17

myself, because I have been struggling with it for two years

18

now.

19

and forth on the power of the State to regulate conduct towards

20

the flag and I have had to take the position that in this case

21

it makes no difference, whether or not we were to decide that

22

the State of New York does have such powers.

23

concede for the purpose of this argument that it does have

24

that power.

25

Q

And I must confess to Your Honor that I have been back

I am willing to

As to this branch of your argument or to your

3

1

whole case?

2

A v

I am willing to concede for the entire case

3

that there is a limited amount of power that the State of New

4

York has to regulate conduct towards the flag.

5

Q

I take it, though, you would say that that power
J

6

ends as of the moment that the conduct is communicative.

7

A

Absolutely.

8

Q

And that it ends as soon as there is a claim

9

that it is communicative?

10

A

Well, I would say, first, we may not have to

11

reach that point, because the statute on its face obviously

12

restricts communicative acts, and that even if we had, for

13

example, a statute like the Federal Government has recently

14

enacted which omits any reference to speech, except, I might

15

point out, the word "defile" 'which

16

having speech connotation. Assuming that that word was out

17

and we had the Federal statute in question we would then have

18

to reach the question as to whether it was constitutionally

19

applied.

20

tc speak on it, because I think even if we had the Federal

21

statute in New York, the particular facts in this case would

22

net allow a conviction.

23

has an interpretation

But we can avoid that problem, although I am prepared

But assuming for a moment that was the statute we

24

had, you know this goes far beyond the Federal statute.

25

know, I might point out that the honorable Ramsey Clark and I
9

You

1

realize it is not binding on the Court in any manner whatsoever

2

he still made a very apt observation to Congress when they were

3

adopting the statute that the words as used in the New York

4

statute a'nd in the proposed statute before Congress was very

5

much like the New York statute.

6

Q

Let me see if 1 follow you.

Of course, your

7

concession does not dispose of this matter for this Court, but

8

I want to get your position clear,

9

Suppose you have here a statute, the statute of New

10

York, that said it shall be unlawful for any person in public

u

deliberately to set fire to and burn an American flag.

12

all the statute said, and that's all Mr. Street did.

13

indicted for that, and there is no speech element whatever.

14

You do not take the position that that would be a violation of

15

the United States Constitution?

16

A

17

C

IS

That's
And he is

I do not.
If in addition to that, if he uses some language,

do you claim that that purges him?

19

A

20

Q

I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.
But if in addition to burning the flag he uses

21

some language, such as he does here, do you claim that that

22

purges him of burning the flag?

.

23

A

j

That is the nub of the problem, because that is

24

exactly what we are saying.

25

this circumstance of Mr. Justice Fortas which he pointed out,

We

10

are saying also that even unde:

1

that the act could then be coupled with other acts that in and !

2

of itself now brings it out of the simple due process problems

3

of a criminal statute and cloaks it with First Amendment

4

problems.

5

6

Q

Don't you think that there would be any First

Amendment problem in the case put to you by Mr„ Justice Fortas?

7

A

Not necessarily, because on its face there is no

8

restriction of speech, but there may be, for example, as

9

applied, a person may be doing the burning and shouting, "This

to

United States does not belong in Vietnam.”

11

Q

What if he is not saying anything?

12

A

No words?

13

Q

Don't you think this is a First Amendment

A

No, I don't think there is.

14

problem?

15
16

There has to be a

communication.

17

Q

Don’t you think that is a communication in and

19

A

Not necessarily.

20

Q

Could it be?

18

of itself?

He doesn't say a word.

He just
»

21

burn$ the American flag in front of public places like this.

22

A

Could it be?

The answer to that —

23

Q

You mean that if Street had not said a word, that

24

if he had not said a single word, that he just burned the flag,

25

than you wouldn't be here?

11

1

A

If Street had not said a word — not

2

necessarily.

3

If the burning of the flag took on a secondary meaning ~~ for

4

example, if this were a protest where people realized that the

5

burning was £©r a purpose, a protest, was a communication.

I ani trying to get to the "not necessarily" part.

6

Before Kleenex was on the market, for example, the

7

word Kleenex had no secondary meaning for a number of years.

0

But it got a meaning because people started using it.

9

thing with draft card burning.

The same

Today when a fellow burns a

to

draft card in public, we very well know what he is doing, that

n

he is communicating a protest against the Vietnam war.

12

burning hasn6t gotten that secondary meaning, but I submit it

13

may very well get to that point.

14

But that is not our problem at this time.

Flag

I am

15

willing to concede right now that the simple act of burning the

16

flag in New York, but not under the statute because the

17

statute goes far beyond that problem.

18

Q

i
Yes, but my question to you, which you answered,j

19

I postulated that the statute did not contain any reference

20

to verbal statements, but the New York statute does, as you

21

pointed out.

22

A

I agree with Mr. Justice Fortas.

23

Q

I am not indicating any attitude.

24

A

I understand.

25

Q

That the language of the New York statute in this
12

I might point out --

1

2

respect does not make a difference, but your answer to my
question was very carefully restricted.

3

4

A

Thank you.

I might —

Q

I will ask you, in connection with the precise

5

argument you are now making what you say about this statement,

5

“But it has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of

?

speech or the press to make a course of conduct illegal merely

8

because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or

9

carried out by means of language, either written, spoken, or

!G

printed."

11

A

Mr. Justice Black, I hope by the time I finish

!

12

today, and after this Court has seriously considered the merits

13

of the case, that that statement would not be the law of this

14

land.

15

Q

In other words, we would have to overrule that?

16

A

I am not saying that, because we don't even have

17

to reach that question, because we have a statute on its face

18

that abridges the freedom of speech, and you don’t even have to

19

reach that problem.

20

Q

What I am saying, however —

Why don't we have to reach it if you say if the

21

conduct itself does not violate the Constitution, but it does

22

violate it because of the language in the statute.

23

A

The reason , Mr„ Justice Black, that I say we

24

don't have to reach it is because Street stands convicted under

25

a statute that was unconstitutional on its face as being an
13

1

obvious restriction on verbal speech that says you can't use

2

words, and that he has a right, I believe, to attack that

3

statute and thereby attack his conviction, even though New York

4

may well have the right to outlaw exactly what he did.

5

think Thornhill v« Alabama is exactly that type of a situation.

And I

6

But to get back to ycur question, Your Honor, I would

7

like to feel that the issue here on an act as well as words is

8

whether a communication was made, and whether the communication

9

was understood, because isn't this truly the problem of a

10

freedom-of-speech case?

A communication of an idea to the publjJc

11

and the receipt of that communication by the public, and this is

12

the nub of the issue that Mr. Justice Black referred to, and

13

this is the nub of the other issue in this case, which I freely

14

admit does not have to be reached, but if reached, should be

15

decided on drawing criteria for us to know when act and speech

16

is speech, and when act and speech is not speech, and therefore

17

not entitled to First Amendment protection.

18

If I might digress just for a moment —

19

Q

2.0

21

22
23
24
25

I notice that Judge Fuld’s opinion doesn’t deal

with your argument, which I gather is an argument of over breadth!,
that because the statute deals both with conduct and words, thisappellant has standing to attack the constiti
statute on its face.

ality

of the

Is that your argument?

A

Yes, it is.

Q

Now, why is it Judge Fuld’s opinion didn’t deal

14

1

with that?

2

A

He deals with it only in a footnote-»-

3

Q

1 raise this because I gather the States are

4

going to contend it does not abridge free speech. And that it

5

was not considered because you did not raise it,

6

A

We did, and it was considered, Your Honor, at

7

page 4A of the decision, footnote 1.

8

argument of overbreadth and vagueness in the Court of Appeals.

We raised the entire

9

Q

How about the trial court?

10

A

Well, at the trial court, I might point out,

11

that on an examination of the record, as I was making my

12

motion, I was politely asked really to sit down.

13

really got to finish making our motion, and not only was the

14

issue discussed at the trial court, but it was also discussed

15

at the Court of Appeals and dealt with in that motion.

We never

16

But I might point out, Mr. Justice White, that the

17

overbreadth argument is a First Amendment argument and not a

18

14th Amendment argument.

19

It would be my understanding that provided any issue on First

20

Amendment infirmities raised in any manner whatsoever, whether

21

it be overbreadth or on its face or improper application of the

22

statute, it would still be a First Amendment objection and

23

properly raised.

24
25

Q

We raise First Amendment questions.

Well, what would you say if we thought we had to

read Judge Fuld's opinion as not treating the question because
15

1

as a matter of State law your failure to raise it at the trial

2

precluded any right to have it considered in the Appellate

3

Court?

4

stand?

If we had to read it that way, then where would we

5

A

Of course, if you read it as if I did not raise

6

it.

7

raised a First Amendment objection,

3

for First Amendment problems, and Judge Fuld passed on First

9

Amendment problems and the whole question of overbreadth is a

But it was raised, and in my motion at the trial court I
I said the statute is void

10

First Amendment problem and not a vagueness or due process

problem,

12

Q

What if the Court disagreed with you on that

13

and said simply that you had to raise it a little more

14

precisely?

15
16

A

I have no argument with Mr. Justice White.

that was the decision, certainly, under the rules of the court—

17

Q

The First Amendment raises all the issues.

18

A

I would believe, sir, that it does.

19

Q

Do you have to rely on that?

20

A

In this case?

21

22

If

If I haven't raised — as far as

the overbreadth, I would say yes.
Q

But as far as the—

As far as the overbreadth, you would have to

23

rely on that position?

24

A

Yes, I would,

25

Q

Do you think, then, that it is the rule in New
16

1

York that, is it the general rule that the Appellate Court

2

does not consider things that are not raised in the trial

3

court?

4

A

Not so, because the Court of Appeals considered

5

the vagueness question, which was not raised at the criminal

6

court level.

7

footnote, was still considered.

statute was vague, because they never said what flag they were

There is something else that bothers me, Mr.

12

Goldstick, and that's the reason I asked you about your answer

13

to Justice Fortas' question.

14

Judge Fuld, in footnote 1, appearing on page 4A of

15

the appendix in this case seems to say for the highest court of

16

New York that this statute simply prohibits public mutilation

17

of the flag.

And that is the way he construes the statute.

Of course, we have to take that construction as though

19

the statute were written that way.

20

to take that construction as though the statute were written

21

that way, under accepted conventional doctrines in this Court.

22

A

And, of course, we have

In due deference to Your Honor's observation,

23

I again refer back to page 8A of the opinion as to the construc­

24

tion of the statute, and it seems to me that the language by

25

discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment of the flag
17

1

in public is the construction given to this statute by Judge

2

Fuld.

And I might —

public mutilation of the American flag.

I can't answer that question.

7

Q

It means something, obviously, you and I would

8

9

have to agree.
A

Of course it means something, but I think there

10

is another answer to your question, and that is simply that

11

the construction of the Court of Appeals was not available

12

to the criminal court judge when he tried the case.

13
14

Q

Tell me, Mr. Goldstick, is the whole of your

motion at page 13A in the trial court, the motion to dismiss?

15

A

Page 13A?

IQ

Q

Is this it?

17

"Before we plead to this case, I

would like to make a motion to dismiss."

Is that it?

18

A

Yes, Your Honor, that is it.

19

Q

And what is it in that motion that you say raises:

20
21

22

23

the overbreadth question?
A

Simply the reference to the First Amendment,

that we were engaged in First Amendment activities.
Q

"Under the First Amendment, I feel —" This is

24

the only reference, isn't it, to the First Amendment?

25

the First Amendment, the Constitution of the United States,

and of the New York State constitution that freedom of speech

may provide for protest in many forms, whether it be by burning

This is a form of

5

Is that what raises the question?

6

A

Absolutely, Your Honor, and I might say —

7

Q

I would say, on the face of it, Mr. Goldstick,

3

that that would be something like an argument based on symbolic
speech.

10

There is conduct, but that the conduct has the

protection of the First Amendment,

11

A

I might add, Your Honor, that we also handed in a

12

trial memorandum when we made the motion, and the trial

13

memorandum had a full point on overbreadth.

14

part of the record, but it was certainly — and I direct you

13

to page 2, when I was very abruptly requested by the judge,

1G

"Sorry, Mr. Goldstick, no more motions.

17
13

That isn’t a

Let's sit down,"

The issue was raised and argued all the way up, and
I am concerned that it wasn't fully treated by Judge Fuld.

10

There is just one other point that I would like to

20

make, if I may, and that deals with the problem of the statute

21

as applied.

22

was charged with disorderly conduct and with breach of the

23

peace.

24

nothing in the record,not a scintilla of proof, that there was

25

disorderly conduct or that a breach of the peace occurred, or

You will notice in the record that Sidney Street

He was acquitted of disorderly conduct, and there is

13

1

that a breach of the peace was likely to occur,

2
3
4
5

6
7
3

9
10

Now, Judge Fuld bases his decision on the right of
New York, under its police power, to restrict acts that would
cause a breach of the peace or likely to cause a breach of the
peace.

But it is our contention, Your Honor, that there was

no breach of the peace, no evidence of a likelihood of a breach
of the peace, and the only way, therefore, that Street could
have been convicted under this theory that this is a statute
that prevents a breach of the peace would have to be that
there is something inherently dangerous

in this type of conduci;

11

and so that therefore the State of New York has a right to

12

prevent conduct that is inherently dangerous.

13

Q

Mr. Goldstick, I thought Chief Judge Fuld's

14

had to be read somewhatdifferently, that is to say that

15

assuming this is within the ambit of the First Amendment, the

10

statute, and prosecution here are within the ambit of the

17

First Amendment, the conviction was nevertheless justified

13

on the clear and present danger principle, that is to say that

19

there was, in the circumstances of the case, a clear and

20

present danger of public disorder, and therefore, according to

21

Judge Fuld, the conduct was not protected by the First

22

Amendment.

23

A

Mr. Justice Fortas, this Court, I recommend to

24

your reading the record, and, of course, under your powers you

25

have the right to review the record, with regard to the findings
20

1

of the Court of Appeals, and I simply submit that Judge Fuld5s

2

observations are not supported by the record»

3

Q

Let9s go into that»

In your judgment, is my

4

reading of what Judge Fuld was saying incorrect?

5

advanced a different theory which is that Judge Fuld misread

6

this as a disorderly conduct statute, or breach of the peace

statute, and that reading it that way to arrive at his conclu­

sion,

was recognizing that there was a First Amendment problem

engaged in this analysis for the purpose of demonstrating

11

his satisfaction, anyway, that the First Amendment did not

12

protect this particular conduct,
A

13

to

Well, his analysis, if I understand it, would

14

be based upon the power of the State to make some regulations,

15

even though they may fly in the face of the First Amendment

16

problems, and the issue then becomes, Where is the line drawn

17

between what the State can do with regard to First Amendment

18

problems?

19

of a statute, if it comes under the breach of the power of the

20

State to prevent public disorder, then the analogy must follow,

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY BRODBAR, ESQ„,

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. BRODBAR:

15

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

It is the State's contention that the appellant

17

was convicted only for the act of burning; that any reference

10

to language is mere surplussage.

20

is language that is usually set forth by a police officer to

indicate intent on the part of the participant in the crime.

The officer set forth some

It is also significant that the officer did not make

17

that part of his complaint? that he ignored that statement,

10

against strengthening the State8 s position that the arrest was

19

for the act.

20

In passing, I might say that the words "damn flag"

21

would be considered contemptuous under the case of Chapinsky

22

versus New Hampshire, where the statements"damn Fascist" and

23

"damned racketeer" were held to be words which might incite

24

retaliation, and the court there unanimously affirmed the

conviction.

I find it

very difficult.
A

There is nothing inthe statute in regard to the

7

word "public."

We must accept the dictionary meaning of the

a

word "public," that it connotes a reasonable, sizable amount of

9

persons, who are present at a scene, and who might bring

10

disturbance because of an act committed by a person.

11

even two persons present at a scene might justify conviction of

12

Mr. Street.

I think

TV

13

If this court should in its wisdom determine that the

14

language "defile by word" is unconstitutional -— what I mean

15

to say is this: In Chapinsky against New Hampshire, the court

1G

did not go into the second portion of the statute.

17

portion dealt with words and names, and the second portion

13

dealt with sounds and noises.

19

the second portion, and convicted Chapinsky for the use of

20

names, epithets hurled upon the persons in the area.

21

our view that this Court, although the appellant was sentenced

22

for the act of desecration, it is our view and our hope that the

23

Court also determines the validity of the expression "words in

24

the statute."

25

The State of New York, then, may prohibit

permits it, then the State cannot with that legal language create

13

a statute so overbroad that anyone burnixsgthe flag who might be

It is our opinion that the proscription of the

the use of language, which also defies or casts contempt upon

Q

We have to read Judge Fuld's opinion as being

broad enough to include wha.t you say?

3

A

Yes, your Honor.

4

C

You think it does go that far?

5

A

It appears that way, because Chief Judge Fuld

6

makes this statement:

designed to prevent the outbreak of such violence by

3

discouraging" —

"Subdivision 16 of Section 1425 is

9

Q

Where are you?

10

A

That is on page 8A of the record.

11

"... is designed to prevent the outbreak of such

12

violence by discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment

13

of the flag in public."

14

It is our opinion that this was mere dictum in a case,

15

but it shows the inherent feeling of Chief Judge Fuld in

10

speaking for the entire court, that even if this case had just

17

words in it, that the decision might be the same.

10

Q

Does treatment necessarily include words?

19

Yes, treatment is a broad term that includes
\

20

conduct, it includes words, it is an attitude, it is a behavior.
Q

May I say something?

Suppose there was no

22

burning at all and I just say something contemptuous of the

23

flag, is that treatment of the flag?

24

A

Yes.

Fuld starts a case, we are concerned with the

I am here not to defend my flag

12

That is my purpose.

13

Your view, 1

judge is, if a man says something

14

makes a speech about his views he has committed a crime and

15

that the First Amendment doesn't excuse it?

In other words, contempt.

25

A

If the case deals with only the appellant's act

of burning the flag, but it is our wish, the wish of the State
of New York that this court would determine the entire statute,
and if it should hold that the words are in violation of the
First Amendment, that the act be divisible, that the statute
50

1

be divisible, and that there be left for the State of New York

2

to enforce desecration by act.

3

Q

Does it contain a separability clause?

It does not, but the logical reading of it, the

could stand alone.
Q

7

I am not talking about the Federal Statute, I am

talking about yours.

There is no language in the statute.

10

Q

Do you have any general rules that courts con­

11

struing things as separable, that they are two separable trials

12

in New York?
A

13

No, but there is a strong presumption of

14

constitutionality and there is also a presumption that if a

15

part of the statute falls, that the rest may remain, unless it

16

is impossible to keep the remaining part of the statute.

17

Q

What is that, you say that is a presumption?

13

A

Presumption of constitutionality is the strongest

'i

19

presumption.

20

the statute is bad, then there is also presumption that the

21

remaining part of the statute could stand, unless it is im­

22

possible to consider it so.

However, if the court should feel that part of
