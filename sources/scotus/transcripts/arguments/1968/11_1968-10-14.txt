MR„ CHEIF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

conspiracy to commit espionage against the United States under

Title 18, United States Code, Section 794.

His conviction was

Circuit.

11

detailing the intermediate pleadings between the filing of the

12

petition for certiorari and this oral argximent, sxaffice it to

18

say that pursuant to the order in the Kolod case, the Govern-

14

merit conceded that certiorari should be granted, that there

15

should be a remand to the District Court for an in camara ex

16

parte hearing with respect to electronic surveillance conducted

17

in this case.

18

A petition of certiorari was filed here.

Without

In the brief filed in this Court in Ivanov, the

19

Government says that conversations of each of the petitioners

20

in these cases were overheard by the use of electronic surveil­

21

lance equipment and footnoted is this statement, "In some of

22

the instances, the installation had been specifically approved

23

by the then Attorney General.

authorisation."

2

Experience would indicate to us* 1 submit, that that

3

is a concession of both wiretapping and eavesdropping in this

4

case.

5

This case is significantly different from the case

6

just argued at bar because the Government seriously avers in

7

this case that there is a National security consideration to

0

be weighed in the balance of competing and social interests.

9

1 think it is equally significant, if the Court

10

please, if I may say so at the outset of the agrument, that

11

the Government by that reason does not ask for different treat-j

12

ment between Alderman and Ivanov.

13

the same treatment.

14

with respect to the logs, electronic logs, memoranda and records

15

of the electronic surveillance in each.

i6

It asks for precisely

It asks for in camera ex parte proceedings

Now, first of all, it is our position, if the Court

17

please, that the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution does

10

not make a division among the various kinds of crime.

19

not draw a line of demarcation, and the founding fathers, when

20

the Constitution was written and when the American Bill of

21

Rights were forged, understood quite clearly that there is a

22

difference in the various types of crime.

23

It does

They gave recognition to this in Article 3, Section

24

3, of the Constitution when they defined treason, and they

25

prescribed the quantum and quality of proof necessary for a
3

for a treason conviction, but they didn't make any exception
in the Fourth Amendment with respect to spy catchers or sub­
versive hunters.
It is next our position, if the Court please, if the
Attorney General of the United States certifies to the Court
that there is a National security consideration which shou.1I
excuse the United States from making a disclosure with

>rovided he consents to a dismissal of ’prosecution unce.<.
the time-honored prinicple of

Coplo-

against the United

States, which was decided in 1950, At an opinion by Judge
Learned Hand, which was foursquare w:.th the facts in the case
at Bar, there was electronic ?.urvei loanee, an espionage case,
an alleged spy, n convicted spy, and the premise

was articu­

lated that the.'.e the Government had a choice of making a
full disclosure to the defendant, for the vindication of her
constitutional! rights or dismissing it.

The Governme.no

dismissed.
Now, that case, and 1 think it is significant to note,
has stood unassviled by the Government for 18 years until
argument was heard in this case last Term.

That

Co.se was

simply a repetition of the doctrine articulated also by the
Second Circuit in the United States against Andolschek.

So,

if the Court please, it is reduced to essence that the concept
- 4 -

• JO

1

of National security should not be the talisman for a pro

2

tanto suspension of due process of law or of any of the rights

3

guaranteed to an accused in a criminal case.

4

If, in the conduct of relationships between govern­

5

ments in our time, it has become the custom or it has become

6

a necessity to engage in wiretapping or eavesdropping or

7

dissembling or purloining or burglarising or even killing.
It is not our argument in this Court today that the

8
9

Executive Branch should be manacled or impeded or harassed

10

in the conduct of relationships with other governments.

It

11

is our argument here today that at least the Federal Courts

12

should be a sanctuary in the jungle, and that these morals

13

mores should not be imported into the American Judiciary

14

System, and that the fruits of this kind of conduct should not

15

become evidence in a criminal case brought by the sovereign

16

power against an accused, nor should these derived from these

17

kinds of conduct be available to the prosecutor in a criminal

18

case brought by the sovereign power.

and

In essence, as I understand the Government’s position

19

20

in this case, it is asserting its right to be let alone and to

21

that we say

22

in a Federal criminal proceeding.

23
24
25

Q

Amen, so long as the evidence is not offered

That is not quite the issue, unless I misunderstood,

Mr. Williams.

The issue is how should it be determined whether

the evidence is being offered or the fruits of the unlawfully
-

5

-

1

obtained evidence is being offered.
Perhaps I misunderstand, but I thought the Govern­

3

ments position was not to depend on the use of such evidence,

4

but that the Government's position was to insist that whether

5

such evidence is being used and the fruits thereof are being

6

used, should be determined by the Judge in camera,

7

'wrong about that?

8
9

A

Am I

I think that is the Government’s position.

The

Government's position is the same in this case as it is in

10

the Alderman case, and we say just as it is impossible for this

11

kind of determination to be made in the Alderman case, it is

12

equally impossible for this kind of determination to be made

13

in camera ex parte by the Judge even though the issue may

14

affect National security.

15

But the Government has argued in its brief at great-

16

lengths that we are seeking to impede the Government in assur­

17

ing the National security, and I say that we are not.

18

I say that we are not asking that any rules be

19

fashioned to impede or harass -the Government in the conduct

20

of its affairs with other governments, or in the conduct of

21

its duty to preserve the National security.

22

We are asking for a much narrower rule.

23

ing that this kind of evidence not. be offered in Court, and

24

we are saying that, .the same rules should pertain to this kind

25

We are ask­

of evidence as pertains with respect to any other kind of
-

6

-

1

evidence, that there should be a disclosure.

2

may be made under Rule 16 as the disclosure may be made as

3

in any other kind of case to eliminate unnecessary dissemina­

4

tion of the information.

A disclosure

5

So# our position# if the Court please# is that the

6

defendant has the right to disclosure under appropriate pro­

7

tective orders# and he has the right to disclosure to his

8

counsel under appropriate protective orders# regardless of

9

what the nature of the information may be and regardless of

10

whether or not it is contended by the Government that it

11

affects National Security# unless the Government is willing

12

to dismiss the prosecution in which case we agree that it

13

should be excused.

14

Q

You don't mean the Government is saying even if in

15

Alderman s disclosure to the defense# protective orders to take

16

care of the problem were held to be in that kind of case

17

sufficient — You don't mean to say that nevertheless in a
■r

13

National security case there are other considerations of a

19

National security case which argue for the in camera situation?

20

You don't believe the Government is making that distinction?

21

A

I don't read them as making that distinction# sir.

22

1 read them as asking for the same kind of proceeding in each

23

case.

24
25

Q

They are# but you do not read it as saying even if

we loose out in Alderman, nevertheless there are elements in

7

1

in the National security case which justify an in camera

2

proceeding?

3

A

I don't read it that way.

They may contend it orally,

4

I read them as asking for the same kind of hearing,, and 1

5

read them as saying the protective orders can be fashioned

6

here just as in the Alderman case.

7

unhappy conclusion that the alleged spy goes free, then I thinkj

8

we can draw soma consolation from the history of the last

9

three decades; that in the three decades of recorded Federal

If we are driven to the

to

jurisprudence,, during which there were three wars, we have

11

only one instance of an averred spy going free in this frame

12

of reference, and she was the defendant in the case to

13

which I alluded, the CopIon case, and I think we can also

14

get a measure of consulation from the fact that of all of the

IS

crimes in jurisprudence,

16

in the area of espionage he is by and large defused.

the amount of recidivism takes place

Q

Weren't there two others involved in that case?

A

Yes, sir, there are two petitioners in this case.

Q

Were there not involved in this whole episode others?

A

There were

three others who were Soviet nationalists

who had status enough to go back to the Soviet Union with
out blessing.
Now, Your Honor, with respect to the problems that
this Court has propounded on standing in this case, and the
Court has propounded some hard questions with respect to the
-

8

-

1

subject of standing in this case, for the purposes of standing,

2

we do contend in capsulized form that a person aggrieved within

3

the purview of Rule 41 is one against whom the illicit search

4

is directed, whether he is known or unknown at the time.

5

We say, for purposes of standing, that the concept

6

must be considered under the Rule describing an aggrieved

7

person.

8

against the background of an age in which electronic surveil­

9

lance has become a widespread investigative technique, and we

10

must consider in the light of the philosophical rationale for

11

the Federal exclusionary rule.

We say, if the Court please, it must be considered

Now, the rationale of the Federal exclusionary rule

12

13

has been articulated many times by many courts as being simply

14

that the courts recoil at the philosphic

15

end justify the means

16

that the exclusionary rule is designed to discourage it and

17

affect compliance with the acts of the sovereign power with

IS

the law.

19

concept that the

in the administration of criminal justice,

It is our position that' the rule on standing for whici

20

the Government contends is archaic and that it is ineffective

21

against this background.

22

under the Fourth Amendment, by and large we were concerned

23

with cases where the defendant's constitutional rights had been

24

invaded by virtue of the search of his premises, and of

25

seizure of his papers and his effect, so that in the great

During the early evolution of cases
■*

-

9

-

1

majority of cases there was not a serious problem of standing,

2

but we have passed that era and we now have an era where

3

electronic surveillance is used in the following manner, as

4

illustrated in many ways in our papers <>

3

The Government does not listen to the suspect.

It

6

does not invade his premises electronically by planting an

7

electronic bug there.

3

manner, it listens to the conversations of his relatives and

9

friends and associates and it invades the premises of Ms

Rather, in a very careful, selective

10

relatives and friends and associates, and it gathers criminal

11

intelligence by this fact, which it indexes and computerizes

12

and makes dossiersuntil such time as it has by utilizing these

13

leads developed a situation where in an indictment can be secured

14

by the presentation of some of this evidence, a Grand Jury,

15

and subsequently a conviction, can be obtained by the use of

16

the same evidence.

17

And, the suspect, the defendant is left without

18

a remedy because the Government contends he has not been

19

victimised because he was not heard and because no premises

20

in which he had a proprietary interest was invaded.

21

I suggest to the Court that the Governments position

22

on standing in this case with respect to electronic surveillanc

23

is like Solomon's approach to the baby.

24

the Government,

25

that the culprit should not go free.

"Cut it in half," says

There are two competing social interests:

-

10

-

(1)

Society has a major inter

:St

The other is that there should be a deterrence

2

posal would satisfy neither competing social interests.
Why?

5
8
7
8

The Government's pro­

Because it says that a selected class of cul­

prits should go free — those who fall within their concept
of the term standing, but, on the other hand, the green light
should be flashed for a continuation of illicit electronic
surveillance because this kind of activity can remain tremen­

3

dously fruitful and beneficial in the gathering of criminal
10

intelligence without giving the ultimate victim a status to
11

object.
12

Now, we say, if the Court please, that the time has
13
come for standing to be given vis-a-vis electronic surveillance
14

to the following:
15
1.

To those whose conversations are illicitly

16

listened to, and the Government does not gainsay this.
17

2.

To those persons whose premises are illegally

18

invaded by electronic eavesdropping equipment, and as I read
19
the Government's brief, at page 21, in the Alderman case it
20
clearly does not gainsay this because as I previously read to
21

the Court, the Government says it adheres to the position that,
22
a defendant, though not a participant, if the overhearing occur
23

-

red on premises owned by him or in which he had some interest
24

he has a standing.
25
11

1

Now, I suggest to the Court that one who is the

2

subject matter of an overhearing illegal in nature must have

3

standing if illicit electronic surveillance is to be deterred

4

by Federal agencies.

S

Finally —

6

Q

The subject matter of the conversation and so forth?

7

A

Yes, sir, and finally, I say this and this sounds

8

very much like a simplistic approach to the problem and I

9

assure the Court that it is not a simplistic approach to the

10

problem,

I assure you that consideration has been given to

1!

all of the social and legal interests in making the statement,
I believe that standing must be given to a co-defenda it

12

13

in a criminal case whether he be named as a co conspirator

14

or not, I say this first of all because it is hard to conceive

IS

that defendants can be joined in a criminal case in the Federal

16

Courts under Rule 8, which provides for joinder of defendants

17

unless there be what could have been averred to a conspiracy.
Why?

18

Because the Rule provides that they must have

19

been engaged in an act or a series of acts or transaction

20

or series of transactions constituting an offense.

25

Q

Suppose he is a defendant being separately prosecuted

22

in connection with the same tranactions and he is not a co­

23

de fendanc?

24
25

A

That is why we are driven, Your Honor, in order to

avoid this kind of circumvention, to say that the overall
-

.12

1

position of the defendant is that he has standing if the search

2

was a search directly against him,

3

Q

So, you don't want us to understand your statement

4

as a category precluding you from suggesting its expansion at

5

a later date?

6

A

I don't want, if the Court please, for anyone to

7

do by indirection that which is inhibiting directly.

8

prosecutor, by the simple device of not joining two persons

9

in the same prosecution, could subvert the proper concept of

10
11
12

13

standing, then I would be opposed to that.

If the

Thatis why I

suggest, Your Honor, as an umbrella under which to gather alg
of the kinds of electronic surveillance, the fruits of which
should be excluded, the rule that a person aggrieved within

14

Rule 41 is a person against whom the electronic surveillance

15

was directed.
We all know that when an electronic surveillance

16
17
13
19

is directed against, a person, it is not only against him but
it is against those engaged in the illicit enterprise with him
whether identified or unidentified at the time.
When there is a monitoring, the Government is not

20
21

22
23
24

25

just interested in what it hears about "X", it wants to know
about his business associates and friends and acquaintances.
Q

You don't go so far as to suggest that all rules of

standards in this area should be abolished and the interest
and deterrence of illegal enforcement activity should lead us
13

1

to say that the Government never uses anything that it has

2

obtained.

You don't go that far.

3

A

In this case I don't have to go that far,

4

Q

Where do you stop short?

5

A

I believe in People versus Martin*, which was decided

6

by the Supreme Court of California, is a proper ruling.

7

been adopted by California.

8

because I do not believe the Court lends itself to illegal

9

conduct on the part of the prosecution.

That abolishes all illegal evidence

10

Q

Where are the rules you suggest?

11

A

I am not asking the Court in this hearing to

12

13

adopt that rule.

It has

I am asking this Court to adopt a rule

which is something short of that but which I believe —

14

Q

IIqw far short of it?

15

A

But I believe it will be an adequate determination

16

to illegal eavesdropping.

17
18
19

Q

How far short of it?

A

It is this far short, Your Honor, that before a

defendant could come in and compel the kind of disclosure that

20

we are talking about in this proceeding here this morning,

21

he would either have to have been the participant in a con­

22
23

24
25

versation which was invaded or he would have to have been the
owner or occupant or have a proprietary interest in premises
v/hich

were invaded, or he himself would have had to have been

the. subject matter of the conversation which was illicitly
-

14

?

overheard.

2

Finally.» he would have to be a co~conspirator

3

or co-defendant of the person who fell within the purview of

4

that particular rule or standing.

5

Q

Whether or not named?

6

A

Whether or not named because I think we have to

7

go that far because otherwise there can be a ready and easy

8

circumvention of the rule.

3

Government suggests, a rule that would permit indiscriminate

10

rummaging through the Government’s file to some illicit con­

11

duct on behalf of some Federal Agency.

I do not contend, however, as the

I am confining it to this, and I say the best capsul™

12

13

ized sommary that we can fashion to cover all of those things

14

in one short business phrase, and I hope it is not an over

15

simplification, is to give standing to one against \tfhom,

16

whether identified at thetime or not, the search of the

17

Government agents is directed.

18

Q

Plus his co-defendant?

19

A

I said that if the search is directed against him,

20

21
22

he is the co-defendant.
Q

It was not directed against him, but he was a co­

defendant.

23

A

Yes, sir, whether it was named or not.

24

Q

Suppose out in San Francisco the Government illegally

25

bugs a place and they hope to overhear a conversation in which
-

15

-

1

John Jones name is mentioned.

2

Jones,, but out of something they heard, they look into John

3

Jones and find he has been guilty of income tax evasion, and

4

they prosecutis him for that.

5
6
7
8

9
10

11
2

A

They were not looking for John

Would he have standing?

It wuauld have to be turned over to him for the rule

he contended.
Q

Even though he was the subject matter, otherwise

the Government was innocent?
A

Otherwise you cannot get effective compliance of the

rule outlawing electronic surveillance.
Q

That is why I asked you how far you are going to

abolish old rules or standards.

3

A

I am not asking that, Your Honor.

14

Q

I know you are not, but I wonder if it isnot tanta­

5
6

mount to that.
A

I am asking the Court to fashion a rule of standing

7

which encompasses the interests which I believe need to be

8

served if we are to have an effective exclusionary rule with

9

respect to electronic espionage.
I say to the Court that it will be used because it

20
21

22
23
24
25

will still be fruitful and beneficial to Federal agents --Q

It really sounds to me in the area of electronic

surveillance what you are suggesting is that the only really
practical way to make deterrents meaningful is just to bar
the Government from using any electronic surveillance legally
6

obtained in any case.

1
2

A

Except that we are not going to stumble into the

3

pitfall suggested by the Solicitor General that we are asking

4

to go through the Department of Justice and rummage through

5

all of the files which can be classified as garnered illegally.
We are saying that before we have a right to have

6

7

a disclosure of those materials, we must be in one of the

8

categories which I have gone into.

9

Q

Take the case I have put to you.

Jones, in fact, was

10

come upon through this lead in the overheard sample conversa­

It

tions, but Jones knows nothing about this,

12

19

20

A

In all of this discussion we had today, ctnd in all

of the discussion we had last Term, and we are at Ills mercy
of the good faith of the Department which we do not impugn
that they will come forward under the doctrine of Eolod and
say we heard John Jones by using an electronic surveillance
conducted in San Francisco.
Jones.

Here is the conversation of Mr.

Make the most of it, if you can relate it to your pro­

secution, we are willing to have any evidence gleaned there­
from stricken.
Of course, it goes without saying that Jones has

21

22
23
24
23

no way to vindicate his constutional rights.
Q

What you are saying is that Jones would not have

any right to insist that the Government turn over information
to him as to whether or not it had obtained the information

'

-

17

-

i

1
2
3
4

that way?
A

He would have the right to insist on it, but he would

get it entirely dependent upon the good faith of the Government ”
Q

Does this mean that in every case the defense hires —

5

we don5t know where the Government got its evidence, but maybe

6

it got it through some lead through illicit electronic surveil­

7

lance?

3

A

We want the Government to tell us what it did.
The Government, under the Kolod case,has an obliga­

tion, as I understand, to come forward with any evidence which

10

relates to the defendant, any evidence relating to the

11

defendant which has been ssired by electronic surveillance.

12

Q

Of course, the Government had initially come out with

13

the information, but what I am asking is in the Jones case

14

does Jones' lawyer initiate some proceeding to have the Govern­

15

ment say whether any of this evidence came in?

16

A

If Kolod is complied with, the Government would

17

admit, but I would say out of an abundance of caution, it

13

would behoove Jones’ lawyer to ask the question of whether

19

there was any eavesdropping, whether his premises were invaded

20

or whether he was the subject matter of conversation of others.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Then this would be standard procedure in every crimin al

case Government brings?
A

I am. afraid it has to be if we are going to effect­

ively deter electronic surveillance.
I think the same results would apply to wiretapping

case.
Q

But in the non-wiretapping? nonbugging cases? you

would not favor this?
A

No»

I am confining all of

my suggestions and

5

contentions to the areas to which we are concerned? Mr. Justice

6

Harlan? electronic eavesdropping or electronic surveillance.

7
8

Q

But can you make the same kind of rule on the basis

of your argument?

3

A

Yes.

10

Q

But you don't want to go that far?

tl

A

I am not asking the Court to go that far.

12

Q

It is right around the corner.

13

A

As did the Supreme Court of California.

I am asking

14

the Court to go only so far as I have contended in cases

15

involving electronic surveillance.

Thank you very much.

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Solicitor General, you

may proceed with your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.
CM BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, this is the case of Igor A. Ivanov, who, with John
William Butenko, was indicted in the district of New Jersey.
The indictment is in the record and on Page IX the

11

Grand Jury charged that they and three other persons did

12

unlawfully, willfully and knowingly conspire and agree to

13

communicate, deliver and transmit to a fore-sign government,

14

which i© named, and to representatives and agents thereof,

15

directly .and indirectly, information relating to the national

16

defense of th® United States of America, and particularly,

17

information relating to the command and control system of the

18

Strategic Air Command of the United States Air Force with

19

intent and reason to believe that the said information would

20

be used to the advantage of a foreign natiion which is named. x

21

22
23

The other three persons had diplomatic immunity, being
members of a delegation to the United States.
Ivanov is a citizen of the Soviet Union.

E© was an

24

employee in the United States of America of the Amfeor Trading

25

Corporation and as such did not have diplomatic immunity.
20

1

Butenko is a citizen of the United States and the

2

question with respect to him which is essentially the same

3

was with respect to Ivanov is involved in Humber 197 , which

4

is the next case on the argument list, the problem here in

5

many respects is similar to that in the Alderman and Alderisio

6

cases.

7

as

Most of Mr. Williams9 argument in this case was in fact

e

directed fco the issues in the Alderman and Alderisio case with

9

respect to standing.

I will not undertake to discuss that

10

any further except to point out that the statement that the

11

overhearing in Alderman and AXderisio was on Alderisio's

12

business premises is one which has been made by Mr. Williams

13

in the Petition for Rehearing prefaced,, of course, with "we

14

15

been filed by the Government, except one filed by Mr. Spritzer

that question?

The position of the Government today is what is

stated in Footnote No. 1 on Page 2 of the Government*s brief

in the Alderman cases

4

Alderisio*s conversations were overheard were not his own, but

5

business establishments owned by associates of his or firms

that employed him, and that Alderisio himself did not have

office space in the subject premises."

What do you mean by "advised"?

Did the Court

below assume or take the position that this was his business
property?
A

Mr. Justice, this issue has never been

12

considered in any way, shape or manner by the Court below in

13

this case.

14

The problem with respect to electronic surveillance

15

of Alderisio did not get into this case until after -this Court

16

had denied

17

Q

IS

certiorari.
I take it there must be a remand of this case.

I gather this is going to be an issue on the fact, isn’t it?

19

A

I assume that.

20

Q

Does the Government think that depending on how

21

22

that, issue is resolved there may be a question of standing?
A

The issue of standing may be effected by that.

23

It would still be our position that even if it is found that

24

Alderisio has standing, the judge ought to decide in camera

25

whether the material is relevant in any way here for the
reasons developed.

22

1

Q

Is there a difference as to what is relevant

2

that turns on whether or

premises?

not this was or was not. Alderisio’s

4

A

I really donst 'think so, Mr. Justice*

This is because, I gather, the Government would

allow him only the access to tapes of the conversations of

Q

This was irrespective of whether it was at his

home or elsewhere., or business premises?

12

A

If it was at his home or business premises or

13

Mancus©'s which is a place %/her© he has regular desk space

14

he may have a larger place of standing.
Q

15

He may be entitled to more of the tapes?

In

13

other words, he may b© entitled to something more than the

17

tapes of conversations to which he was a party?
A

18

He may have standing, but it would still be our

10

position that the judge ought to make a preliminary determina'

20

fcio.n as to whether the material has any conceivable reference

21

to the particular case, particularly as it involved third

22

parties.

Q

If there is no standing or if there is no

violation of the Fourth Amendment in the first place?

3

A

That is correct.

4

Q

I am still confused.

Is it or is it not the

5

Government3 s position that all of the tapes of all conversa­

6

tions must be turned over to the judge if it is Alderiaio's

7

place of business?

8

A

It is, yes.

9

Q

If if is not,then how much of the tapes are to

10

be turned over, assuming that there are two years of tapes at

11

some place, not Alderisio'e place of business?

12

A

In this case they are not packing cases.

13

Q

You know what I am trying to get at.

14
15

I wish you

would help me with it.
A

I will try to.

I think that, if he has standing

18

there ought then to be turned over to the judge any records of

17

conversations in which he was a party on either side.

18

inclined to think, myself, any conversations which took place

19

while he was present.

20

and I am groping on it.

21

Q

I am

I don't know of any authority on that

To what extent does

whether or not the bugging

22

was at his placa of business or not at his place of business

23

change the Government's position of what should be turned over

24

to the judge?

25

A

If it was at

his place of business I would think
24

1

there was greater standing and greater need to turn the

2

material over.

read that first paragraph meaning this: that in the Alderman

15

in premises owned by him or in which ha had some other

interest at the time.

You understand that paragraph to mean that the

18

Government agreed that in either of these events, not that the

19

material was to be turned over to the judge for

20

examination, but that th© defendant was entitled to have it

21

turned over t© him.

I think you are wrong, Mr. Justice.

X think

the following case will illustrat® that to some- extent.

Q

Is there any instance in which the Government

says th© defendant is entitled t© have material turned over to

him instead of the judge for in camera examination?

difficult to make a general answer to your question»
Q

1 am asking yon, is there any case, forget

Bo you mean bypass the

A

Yes, Mr. Ji^stice.

We are taking the position that

18

any conversation, leaving out the national security now, too,

19

between the defendant and his counsel must be disclosed.

20

Q

I thought you were baking the position that any­

21

thing determined by the trial judge in camera to fall into that

22

category must be turned over.

that is the objective of turning it over

Q

The problem arises

On the question of standing alone, what is the

n

minimum interest in the premises that the defendant might be

12

•able to show that would entitle him to standing?

13

A

X don’t know, Mr. Justice.

I think the

14

variations in the facts are unlimited and it will probably

15

have to be worked out.

16

In the Jones case the defendant had small interest in

17

the premises.

Hcs was a licensee at will, I suppose, to use

the old lingo.

He was a guest in the premises, but he was

there- at the time.

right, for the time-being, arid others where he is simply

Even though A has consented; just as though the

telephone company consented in the Kata case, I don't think

11

that would have made any difference.

11

However, in non® of these eases did the overhearing

12

have anything whatever to do with the evidence which was

13

actually produced at the trial.

14

that and the problem with which 1 am concerned her® is the

15

appropriate protection of the Executive Branch of the Govern­

16

ment in carrying out the President5s responsibility to

17

conduct the foreign relations of the United States and his

18

responsibility as Commander-in-Chief of th® Army and Kavy.

Th© question as to what is reasonable obviously varies

was the only one in all the years since, but

12

14

were dismissed "in the interests of national security."

Mr® Williams said that
in the brief for
United

There have been other cases which have not been

16

brought because the evidence was in fact obtained through

17

illegal surveillance and the officers of the Government felt

18

that they could not appropriately proceed in those cases.

19

But here we have a United States sitisen and a

20

Russian citisen not entitled to diplomatic immunity, and we

21

have a situation where disclosure has been made that there was

22

electronic surveillance and the suggestion is made -that that

23

electronic surveillance iss entirely irrelevant to anything that

24

has appeared in the prosecution and it is our position, and 1

25

think I should be frank to say that this is the case with which

30

1

we are concerned, not Alderman and Alderisio, we can live with

2

that, of course.

3

Q

Do you mean by that that if we were to come out

4

contrary to your position in the Alderman, case you would still

5

urge that there are other reasons why we ought to require in

6

camera inspection?

7

A

Yes,

exactly»

The whole relation of the Execu­

8

tive power here and the whole question of the balance, which,

9

it seems to ass, is clear and important»

10

Q

Suppose we cam® out contrary to your position in

11

Alderman, how would you suggest the issue of national security

12

be brought to the attention of a trial judge in a case like this,

13

by representation of an assistant U. S» attorney?

14

A

Yes, Mr» Justice.

That would b© enough?

much higher authority than a 0. S. attorney.

A

The question would b® undoubtedly considered by

people with higher offices in the Department of Justice.

1 am just

wondering how it would b© brought t© the attention of a trial

judge, by an assistant U. S. attorney?
A

That leaves the impression that the assistant

3

United States Attorney is acting on his own in the provinces

4

someplace and maybe he will and maybe he will not.

S

these matters are closely watched by senior officers in the

6

Department of Justice and the U. S. Attorney acts on instruction

7

Q

Actually,

This Ivanov and Butenko Casa, you are proposing

8

that the material be submitted to the judge during an in

9

camera inspection, are you not?

10

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

11

Q

Maybe I didn’t follow you and Justice Brennan,

12

but you don’t refuse to submit it to the Judge for in camera

13

inspection the issue is whether it should be turned over to

14

the defendants or defendant’s counsel for their inspection

15

without first being sifted by the judge to determine the

16

relevance?

17

A

That is exactly our position here.

I might say

18

I had a good deal of difficulty getting it established that we

10

could take that position here.

20

taken in a case of this sort in any other country that I know

21

of is that neither this court or anything else would have

22

heard anything bout it.

The view which would be

23

We have not taken that position.

24

disclosure that there was electronic surveillance.

25

We have made the

Following the order in the Kolod case we have sought
32

1
2

to get that order modified so that although there will be

i

disclosure it will be disclosure to the district judge.

3

Here all the protective orders that Mr. Williams can

4

devise will not help because if it is disclosed to counsel and

3

the parties it is disclosed to a man who has direct contact

6

to the place where it is not desirable in the national interest

7

that there be disclosure.

3

9
10

Q

Are you asking us to decide here or to leave open

on remand the question as to whether this violates, this
bugging in this particular case, violates the Fourth Amendment?

11

A

Our position would be the same had it

or not.

12

We are not arguing that it did not violate the Fourth Amendment,

13

We are suggesting that there is ground when it could be argued

14

and there may be soma future day when another party comes

15

along where it may be said that it could be developed that

IS

evidence was developed against German saboteurs who landed on

17

our shores and it may b© that the evidence was obtained by

13

wire-tapping and electronic surveillance and that that is the

19

evidence which there was and. which the'Government chose to

20
21

produce.
X frankly would not want to foreclose on such a case

22

that may be made in time of war.

23

saying that any evidence obtained was so inadmissible, we are

24

only contending that, when the position is that the electronic

25

surveillance did not in any way lead to the evidence which was
33

In this case we are not

?

used in the court, that the decision of that question should

2

be made by the district judge in camara without disclosure to

3

the parties or their counsel»

4

Q

In other words, the premise in which you are

5

proceeding here is that you admit for the purposes of this

8

case that this was illegal bugging?

7

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

S

Q

But certainly the case would not even be here if

9

there were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

10

A

I still, Mr. Justice, would like to reserve at

11

soma time the right to argue that there has not been a viola­

12

tion of the Fourth Amendment, but we are proceeding for the

13

purpose of this case

14

Fourth Amendment.
Q

15
16

that this was taken in violation of the

And you are going to remain free to argue to

the district judgefc that there was no violation?

17

A

No, sir.

18

Q

You want to leave it open for another case?

19

A

X want to reserve it for another case at another

20

time under different circumstances involving the national

21

security.

22

Another thing that turns up in the national security

23

issue is that people just wander into the surveillance.

Thirty years ago, X am told, when Mr. Simpson, became

Secretary of State — almost forty years ago, he determined the

20

activities in the State Department by which there was surveil­

22

other people's mail."

and under President Roosevelt,that rule has been changed.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General,

I am not quite clear on

6

the Constitutional distinction you make between national

7

security cases and other cases of illegal espionage»

8
9

A

Speaking in Constitutional terms, I would rely

on the power of the President to carry on foreign relations

10

and the power and responsibility of the President as Commander-

11

In-Chief of the Army and Navy»

12

this court which have recognised the importance of these powers

13

and which have said that the — well, for example, in Kennedy

Thera are numerous decisions of

Similarly, in the Chicago and Southern Airlines case,

10

the Court referred, to the fact that the President, both

19

Commander-in-chief and as the national organ for foreign affairs,

has available intelligence services whose reports are not and

21

ought not be published to the world»

22

powers expressly granted by the Constitution which in my

23

submission must be interpreted together with the Fourth

24

Amendment which does not forbid all searches and seizures, but

25

only unreasonable ones»

It is because of these

1 would argue that in this case,vhile we are not

z

seeking to bring the material into evidence, but are seeking

3

merely to show that it has no conceivable relationship to the

4

prosecution, that a determination by the fact by the independent

5

district judge adequately protects the interests of the defendant»

Q

I assume that the core of the distinction you

7

draw between Alderman,on the assumption that yoixin camera

3

position doesn't prevail in the Alderman case,1s that a

9

protective order there may suffice to protect the interests of

third parties whereas in a national security case protective

orders have

That would be a substantial part -of the distinction.
Q

Are any of those cases you just cited to us

15

premised on the illegality of the Government's action?

Does

1©

it flow .from that that any action that the President takes whicl

17

bears upon his duties as Commander-in-chief

16

affairs, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal, must

19

ba sustained by the courts?

or in foreign

20

A

Certainly not, Mr. Chief Justice.

i

21

Q

Where do you draw the line?

22

A

I think it is very difficult to draw the line.

23

If it

is a question of balance, in this case when the materials

24

are seen by the district judge it will be perfectly apparent

23

that it baars no relation to the prosecution.

38

When the alterna--

1
2
3
4

tive is that it either must foe disclosed directly to the
foreign nation or that the prosecution must foe dismissed.

It

seems to me appropriate to draw the line at a place where it
says that there need not foe further disclosure when there has

5

been an independent determination by the district judge of the

6

question of relevance, particularly when that type of question

7

of relevance is one that judges habitually make and in which

0

they make in a number of other situations which, although not

9

the same, are analogous to this, such as those with respect to

10

the Jencks Act, such as disclosure of Grand Jury minutes,

11

discovery of evidence and things of that sort.

12

Q

What stage of the proceedings should this

13

information be brought to the attention of the Court and

14

counsel?

15

A

Mr. Chief Justice, that is again a difficult

16

question.

17

say that it should be before the trial.

13

at that point it is very difficult for the judge to have any

19

ideas as to whether the material is relevant to what will foe

20

brought out at trial.

21

One might think that in many situations one could
On the other hand,

In most cases it seems to me that it is best to have

22

the disclosure made after th© conclusion of the trial, at

23

which time the judge knows what th® evidence was and has some

24

basis for determining whether it had any source in the

25

material.
39

I

That has two effects.

z

the evidence was tainted, then there must be a new trial, but

3

the other is that because of that the Government prosecutor is

4

going to be extremely careful to see that he does not introduce

5

evidence which can be regarded as tainted because he does not

6

want to be regarded as going through the process of having a

7

trial and then having it set aside.

8

On is that if the judge decides that

In most cases it would be my view that as in this

9

case it is wiser to have the disclosure made after the con­

10

clusion of 'the trial rather than beforehand,

II

Q

12

The maximum that the Government really has to

suffer in any of these cases is dismissal of the prosecution,

I believe so.

That is the same whether it is national security

That, in an aggregate, can be a serious matter.

Q

The interest of the defendant is the same and the

or not.

18

interest of the Government prosecuting is the same.

19

just that the reason for not disclosing is the barrier.

other words, in any of these cases, the maximum harm that can

21

come to the Government is 'the dismissal.

I believe so.
