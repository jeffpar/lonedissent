ARGUMENT OF GEORGE C. PONTIKES, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

1

MR. PONTIKES:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice.

0

May it please the Court:

This matter comes before

9

the Court on a writ of certiorari from the Sixth Circuit Court

w

of Appeals, which affirmed a judgment on conviction for will­

it

fully and knowingly failing and neglecting to report for in­

12

duction in violation of section 462, Title 50 Appendix.

13

The court below found, that is, the trial court,

14

found that the petitioner could not raise a defense of invalid

15

reclassification because he had not exhausted his administra­

16

tive remedies.

1?

Court of Appeals, and when the writ of certiorari was granted,

to

as petitioner understood it, there were two questions to be

19

presented before the Court.

20
21

22
23
24
25

This position was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit

One was whether or not petitioner was required to
exhaust his administrative remedies under the circumstances?
and the other is whether or not the interpretation of section
456(o) of Title 50 Appendix, namely, the sole surviving exemp­
tion provision, whether or not the interpretation of that pro­
vision by Selective Service was correct.

The facts in this case really are simple and are not

i

2

in dispute.

3

The petitioner was horn February 15, 1943,

4

first classified by Local Board No» 9 of Butler County I-A on

5

February 26, 1963.

6

examination on March 23, 1964, the examination to take place

7

April 21, 1964.

He was ordered for a pre-induction physical

He did not respond to that examination, or didn’t show

8
9

He was

up.

He was then classified as a delinquent by his Local Board

10

and on May 1, 1964 they ordered him to report for induction on

11

May 11, 1964.

12

On May 10th he wrote a letter to the Board indicating

S3

that he disagreed with the whole concept of Selective Service

14

and at that point the Board replied and asked him whether he

15

wanted to apply as a conscientious objector.

16

cations, he indicated that he did not.

17

In later communi­

The Board also inquired as to why he checked the box

13

on his original classification questionnaire indicating that he

19

was a sole surviving son.

20

pondence and it came to light that his father had died as a

21

navigator in the Air Force during World War II.

22

Thereupon, on July 27, 1964 he was classified IV-A

23

by his.Local Board.

24

until February 14, 1966.

23

There was some additional corres­

That classification remained in effect

On January 30, 1966, Local Board Wo. 9 came into the
3

i

information that Jack McKart’s mother had died, the petitioner’s

a

mother had died.

3

meaning that he had no sisters and both of his parents were now

4

deceased.

That left McKart without a "family unit/'

On the basis of that information, the Local Beard con­

5
6

tacted the State Director for Selective Service of Ohio, who

7

determined that because there was no "family unit" the petitioner

8

was no longer eligible for the sole surviving son exemption.
Therefore, he was reclassified on February 14, 1966„

9
10

On February 24, 1966 he was ordered for another pre-induction

11

physical examination on March 17, 1966 *

12

he wrote and told the Board he would not respond.

He is not respond and

\

Thereupon, he was again classified as a delinquent

13
14

and, as a delinquent, on March 31, 1966, he was ordered to re­

15

port for induction on April 21, 1966.
The trial of this matter was held on May 16, 1967

16
17

where he was convicted by the lower court and given a sentence

18

of three years in the custody of the Attorney General.
Now, Your Honors, before we proceed into the main

19
20

question, I think, that is of interest to the Court, I want to

21

say, first of all, we, as petitioners, understood that both the

22
23
24

25

question of the exhaustion of the administrative remedies and
the question of the correct interpretation of 456 was before the
Court.
The respondent, the United States of America, has
4

i

chosen not to brief the question of whether or not Selective

2

Service9s interpretation of section 456 is correct.

3

not argued that at all.

4

have, in effect, conceded our position, but I will allow them

5

to speak for themselves.

We would, therefore, maintain that they

Therefore, I will deal exclusively with the exhaustion

6

Further, I feel that this is a question that is of

7

question.

8

major impojrtance in this case.

9

They have

Let me start off by saying that contrary to

10

Q

The Court of Appeals never reached the merits?

11

A

They did not. Your Honor, and neither did the

12

District Court, because they felt it was rot. necessary, given

13

the posture of the case.

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We would like to make clear that we are not asking
this Court to overrule its position in United States versus
Falbo or Estep versus the United States.
The first part of the Government *s brief treats our
position as if we are asking the Court to overrule Falbo arid
Estep, and we are not.
Secondly, we do not think that the fact that, the
petitioner in this case was, in the words of the Government's
brief, deliberately and flagrantly avoiding Selective Service
and refusing to have anything to do with Selective Service,
really has any bearing on the question of whether or not he had
to exhaust his administrative remedies.
5

1

1 think the question of whether or not he had to ex­

2

haust his administrative remedies is a question to be decided

3

entirely apart from his own particular attitude toward Selective

4

Service.
Now, then? as to the exhaustion question, I think first

5

6

we have to take up the question of whether or not the petitioner

7

had to appeal his original reclctssificafcion, and on that question

8

our position is as follows:
First and foremost, if the classification or the re­

9
10

classification on February 14, 1966 was based upon a completely

11

erroneous interpretation of section 456, we would maintain that

12

this was an act beyond the jurisdiction of Local Board No.

13

On that basis, as has often been said in this Court, there is

14

no need to exhaust»

15

the Board»

16

on that basis we would maintain, first of all, that there was no

17

need for him to appeal»

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

9.

This is an act beyond the jurisdiction of

It is an act totally prohibited by the statute, and

Secondly, and concomitantly, we would say that this was
a pure question of law? that is to say, the Local Boards and the
State Appeal Boards are not competent to make legal judgments»
I believe as recently as the case of Oestereich versus the
Selective Service System, No» 46 in this Court, Justice Harlan
very properly and very incisively pointed out. that the nature
of Selective Service Boards are such that they are not equipped
to deal with judicial questions»
6

1
2

Q

What about the appellant process within the

A

I believe, Mr, Justice, that you will find that

system?

3
4

the Appeal Boards are made up of the same types of persons as

3

the Local Boards are made up? in other words, if you take Local

0

Boards, then the State Appeal Boards, and finally the National

7

Selective Service Board, which is made up of three members, all

8

three Boards do not have persons who have any judicial compe­

9

tence.

10

They are net equipped to render any kind of judicial

decisions whatsoever,,
These are persons who are uncompensated.

11

They hold

12

no formal hearings.

13

as Justice Harlan pointed out in his concurring opinion in

14

Oestereich, no lawyers are allowed.

15

ally prohibited by Selective Service regulation to appear be­

10

fore the Local Boards.

They require no legal briefs# and again,

In fact, they are. specific­

On this basis, we would maintain that the Boards both

17
18

cannot, in fact, make any judicial decisions# and furthermore,

IS

because they cannot., they generally do not, and follow -Q

20
21

fact„

Well, judicial decisions include findings of
N

22

A

23

Q

That is a judicial function, isn't it?

24

A

That is a judicial function, I would agree.

23

Quite correct.

Per­

haps the word "judicial" is a little bit broad for our position.
7

1

I would say they are not qualified to make interpretations of

2

law, statutory constructions, or constitutional decisions,

3

would say that both are the types of judicial functions that

4

they are not competent to engage in.

5

Q

1

What makes these Boards, the Presidential Board,

6

for example, different from an ordinary administrative agency?

7

I suppose in an ordinary administrative agency, you would say

8

that the agency should have first shot at even a pure question

S

of interpretation of the statute,,
A

10

I would say so, Your Honor, but I think there

11

you have an entirely different apparatus»

12

an adversary process which you do not have in Selective Service.

13

The Selective Service System is not intended to be an adversary

14

process„

15

You have, for example,

The reason it is not intended to be an adversary pro­

16

cess is because it is geared to mobilise manpower in a short

17

period of time, so it simply is not equipped, on that basis.

18

Secondly, as part of the adversary process, you have lawyers

19

appearing for both parties, for a number of parties, before an

20

administrative agency.

21

Q

You don’t have that in Selective Service,

I don’t understand the difference in the first

22

aspect of your argument where you stated that they didn’t have

23

jurisdiction, and the second that they were incompetent because

24

this involves a question of law.

25

A

What is the difference?

Well, I would say that whc.t we are saying is that
8

1

the act? the decision on their part to reclassify on February 14 ,

2

1966 was an act beyond their jurisdiction? because we contend

3

that the petitioner was entitled to his sole surviving son exemp­

4

tion? even though his mother had died»

5

Our contention is to the statutory construction ques­

6

tion? which is that that was a completely erroneous .interpreta­

7

tion of the law and that? therefore? the reclassification was an

8

act beyond their jurisdiction»
Q

9
10

That is our position»

That presupposes that we decide the statutory

construction question here»

11

A

That is correct»

12

Q

I see,

13

Q

What would you say if the statute said expressly

14

that before one may raise a matter in a criminal case? he has to

15

have exhausted his appellate remedies within the Selective Serv­

16

ice System?

If the statute made that requirement? I would say

No,

You are making a statutory construction argument.

Q

What do you think the Court was doing in Falbo —

saying —

4

just saying you have to exhaust, or that the statute required

5

you to exhaust?

6

A

No, I think the decision in Falbo was based, if I

7

may say, on two points:

8

Court will recall, Nick Falbo was seeking a XV-D classification

as a minister and this is essentially a factual question within

11
12

13

One was the fact that in Falbo, if the

the competency —Q

You think this was just a judicially imposed

exhaustion doctrine, or was it a statutory construction case?
A

I would say, myself, that it is a judicially

14

imposed doctrine.

15

sions of the boards of Selective Service shall be final.

16

was the law up until July 1, 1967, at which time was added the

17

now section 10(b)(3), which this Court has had occasion to con­

18

strue recently, where it is said that there will be no review

19

until there has been a response to an order to report for induc­

20

tion, either affirmatively or negatively, and then the review

21

will only encompass the question of whether the Board had juris­

22

diction as a matter of basis in fact.

principle on the general grounds, applying to all administrative

agencies.

appeal process — they were drawing a distinction between

4

Selective Service and other agencies.
Q

5
6

I don't think on that point -- that is, as to the

You mean you don't think the Court was saying fcha

Congress intended the registrant first to exhaust his remedies?
A

7

In my recollection of the reading of the Falbo

8

decision, Your Honor, I don't think that question specifically,

0

as to fcha intent of Congress, was ever raised.

I do feel that

10

in Falbo the primary motivation of the Court, and the primary

11

thinking of the Court, was based on its conception of the reason,

12

for Selective Service, the theory being that because there was

13

mobilization, and this was a system to mobilize manpower, it

14

was necessary that you require an exhaustion; and further, that

15

you require a completion of the administrative process before

16

there could be a defense raised in a criminal prosecution.
You will recall, Justice White, that prior to Falbo

17
18
19
20

21

and Estep, the courts throughout, the Nation read Selective Serv­
ice as to allow no defense whatsoever to criminal prosecutions.
Sc this was at that time an opening up of the original statutory
scheme„
Our position as to the exhaustion is based --

22

25

Q

You mean what was thought to be the statutory

A

Correct; what was thought to be the statutory

scheme.

11

1

scheme»

2

I stand corrected»
Our position as to exhaustion is really based on the

3

fact that, Number 1, this is a pure question of’lav;,, and coupled

4

with the fact that the appellate exercise here would be a pure

S

futility.
The National Director had already indicated his con­

8

cated his position»

9

For the petitioner to be required,, under these circumstances, to

10

The State Director of Ohio had indi­

engage in these appeals would have been pure futility»
The Government makes, or attempts to make, the argu­

11
12

ment that the State Appeal Board does have the duty under the

13

requisite regulations and statutes to classify de novo.

14

the theoretical duty? that is no question about that.

15

would say, as we said in our reply brief, it would be a departure

16

from reality for the Government to contend that as a practical

17

matter this occurs when the issue is one of statutory construc­

18

tion»

19

That is
But I

If the issue were one of a factual determination, there

20

might be grounds for disagreement between the National Director

21

and the appellate processes, but where the Local Board, or the

22

State Appeal Board, or even the National Appeal Board, is faced

23

with the question of pure statutory construction which this case

24

involves, then there is no question in my mind that in 99 out

25

of 100 cases they will follow the National Director»

12

As a matter of fact, it was recognized by the Court

1

2

in Sicarella versus the United States, where a State Appeal

3

Board had before it a determination not by the National Director

4

but by the Justice Department in its Conscientious Objector

5

Sector, an opinion that Sicarella was not a conscientious objec­

6

tor because he was not opposed to theocratic war.
At that time the Court found that this was an error

7
8

of law in the determination by the Justice Department, and then

9

concluded that the Appeal Board probably followed this recom­

to

mendation because it was an authoritative source and, thereby,

1!

reversed the conviction.
Certainly if a State Appeal Board is going to follow

12
13

the Justice. Department, it most certainly will follow the legal

14

opinions of the National Director.
Q

15

Is there any lav/ or regulation that requires any

16

of these boards to follow anybody else"s directive other than

17

their own?

18

18
20
21

A

No, there is not.

As a matter of fact, the theory

of the lav/, Justice Marshall, is -Q

Well, the second question is, is it not true that

on these boards there are lawyers?

22

A

There may or may not be lawyers.

23

Q

What do you mean, there may or may not?
/

24
25

A

Not as members necessarily.

'7

A

I can!t assume that none of them are, Justice

8

Marshall.

1 can say, however, that on the basis of the way in

9

which the boards operate, and on the fact that they are required

A

Oh, no; we are not saying that at all.

We are

12

saying you don’t have to exhaust, your administrative remedies

13

because, as we have pointed out, this .is a pure question of law.

14

The agency had already made its determination and there was no

15

question that the appeal process would be a futility,

16

Q

It is sort of an afterthought, isn’t it?

17

A

No, I would say it is the x’eality of the exper-

18
19

20
21

ience of the agency,
Q

Well, if it had been a fact decision, he still

wouldn’t have appealed, would he?
A

No, that is true.

But a fact decision is a dif­

22

ferent matter, as we heive pointed out, and that is really the

23

point at which this case is distinguished from the Falbo and

24

Estep kind of rationale, the doctrines embodied in those cases.

25

In those cases, both of them, the boards had to determine

15

1

whether or not a person was a minister , and this is essentially

2

a factual determination to be made upon the evidence presented

3

by the individual registrant.

4

Here, in the case of McKart , the matter is strictly one

5

of interpretation of section 456? namely,, was McKart to be de­

6

prived of his IV-A exemption because he had no family unit left.

7

We would maintain that where that is the issue, and where the

8

agency — in this case Selective Service

9

its mind that McKart was not entitled to the exemption, that for

had already made up

10

him to be required to go through the appeals process would have

11

been a complete futility.

12

Now we go to the other aspect of the Government.8 s posi

13

tion, which is that independent of McKart having failed to ex­

14

haust his administrative remedies, he ought to at least have

13

been required to take a physical examination.

16

As to that, I call this Court's attention respectfully

17

to its recent decision in Oestereich versus the Selective Servlet!

18

System where, in a case very similar to this one, the Court did

19

not require Oestereich to take a physical examination.

20

Court will read the decision carefully in the Oestereich deci­

21

sion, you will see that there Oestereich was not told that before

22

he could obtain his remedy by way of civil relief, that he was

23

required to go in and either fail or pass a physical examination

24

As a matter of fact, as far as we can determine — and

23

If the

I have checked the appendix in Oestereich? I haven't been able
16

1

to read the complete record — but as far as I can determine,

2

in the Oestereich decision, Oesfcereich never did take the

3

physical examination.
I would say that if Oestereich is not required to take

4
5

a physical examination as a precondition for giving him civil

6

relief, then certainly I do not think that Jack McKarfc ought to

7

be required to take a physical examination where it would other­

8

wise be futile for him. to exhaust his administrative remedies .

9

Secondly, I think the requirement in Selectiva Service

10

law that a physical examination be taken loses its force in this

11

kind of case.

12

men like Falbo and Estep, where there are essentially factual

13

determinations to be made by the boards.

14

Court, in the interest of maintaining the speed and mobility of

IS

Selective Service, and in the interest of not flooding the

that it is, as we pointed out in our brief, an irony that Jack

of a reclassification that we consider patently invalid, because

without that reclassification, under the existing Selective Serv

6

ice regulations, he could not be required to take a physical

7

examination.
He was not I-A and he was not shortly to be inducted,

8
9

which are the only two grounds upon which a physical examination

10

can be required.

11

a most anomalous situation that he ought to be barred from rais­

12

ing the incorrect statutory interpretation by the fact that he

13

did not take the physical examination which, in itself, could

14

not have been required had the reclassification not been made.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. BEYTAGH:

25

Mr, Beytagh?

ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. BEYTAGH, JR., ESQ.

18

22

Thank you

for your kind attention.

17

21

So on that basis it would strike us as being

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
At the outset, petitioner's argument strikes us as a
somewhat curious one because he wants us to assume, as I under­
stand it, that a question of statutory construction either has
been or will be or should be necessarily decided in his favor.
18

1

Then he builds upon that assumption.

2

I should state that, as we pointed out in our brief,,

3

Footnote 10 of the Government's brief, it was not our intention

4

to concede, as petitioner suggested, anything regarding the

5

construction of the sole surviving son exemption? rather, as we

6

pointed out, neither of the courts below reached this issue and

7

it seems to us that, in light of that fact, and in light of the

8

fact that it is a question of first impression on which no other

9

court has passed, that it is not an appropriate issue that peti­

10

tioner can assert and raise here.
Both of the courts below, as petitioner has noted,

ii
12

found it unnecessary to reach that issue because they decided

13

the case on the exhaustion question.
I think that it is apparent, despite petitioner's

14
15

strenuous efforts to avoid it, that what he really seeks here

16

is an overruling of Falbo.

17

that he has points in his case that are distinguishable from the

18

situation involved in Falbo and Estep; and that, therefore, the

19

Court doesn't have to reach the question of whether the.Falbo

20

doctrine is still good law.

He says that is not what he wants?

It seems to us that, at the outset, the grounds the

21

22

petitioner seeks as making his case a peculiar or unique one

23

are readily answered.

24

two:

25

These grounds, as we understand it, are

One is that the question involved here is a matter of law

or statutory interpretation, and that the agencies of the Selective
19

1

Service System, as I take ifc» from the Local Board through the

2

State Appeal Board» all the way up to the National Appeal. Board,

3

are either incompetent; unqualified; or for some other reason

4

unable to pass on such question.
It seems to us that this is simply not reflective of

5

6

the fact.

7

lawyers on Selective Service Appeal Boards,

8

is that the regulations themselves require that one member of

9

each State Appeal Board be a lawyer.

10

11

The question was raised about whether there are any
The answer to that

As a matter of fact, as to the National Appeal Board»,
the Chairman himself is a lawyer.

He is a Probate Judge.

12

Moreover» it is a little bit difficult to understand

13

how you can say that certain issues are simply matters of law.

14

Every question of classification involves questions of law» what

15

the boards are seeking to do is, pursuant to the regulations in

16

the statute as they interpret and construe them» to give each

17
18
19

registrant the appropriate classification that Congress has deter­
mined that he should have.
They work against the background and in the framework

20

of the Selective Service Act and the pertinent regulations.

21

is no other way they can operate.

22
.23
24
25

The3re

Insofar as the statute itself is concerned» it is not
silent on this subject.

It says that Local Boards shall have

the power within their respective jurisdictions to hear and
determine» subject to the right of appeal to the Appeal Boards
20

1

herein authorized, all questions or claims with respect to the

.2

inclusion for, or exemption or deferment from training and serv­

.3

ice of all individuals within the jurisdiction of these boards.

4
S
6

There are similar provisions that relate to the de
novo classification by the Appeal Board and the National Board.
So it seems to us that for several reasons, petitioner

7

is not on sound ground when he suggests that matters of law are

8

wholly without the competence of these boards.

9

fact, this Court in Cox versus the United States, in 332 U.S.,

10

noted that questions of classification are matters of law for

11

the courts to decide, not the jury.

12

As a matter of

It seems to us that it is logical to conclude from fchai

13

that when these Local Boards and the State Appeal Board and

14

the National Appeal Board are passing on these questions, that

15

necessarily they are involved in legal issues.

16

there is a continuum that exists here.

17

peculiarly factual in nature, and some questions more appro­

18

priately legal in. nature.

19

20
21

I realize that,

Some questions are more

But what I am seeking to point out is that as a Local
Board faces a question of classification, it has to face that
issue against the backdrop of the Selective service Act and the

22

pertinent regulations.

23

can determine.

24

to pass on these matters, it seems to me,.is simply wrong.

25

Those are laws insofar as I know and

Therefore, to say that they have no competence

Petitioner also suggests that on that point, as was
21

1

noted by Mr. Justice White, in conclusion on the point of pass­

2

ing on the question of statutory interpretation or law, it does

3

seem to us that it is not inappropriate hers to give the admin­

12

the Selective Service System.

15

A

Yes.

Q

But certainly in other contexts, it is the usual

22
23
24
25

rule, isn't it, that the administrative agency view should be
obtained?
A

That is what I ant suggesting should obtain here?

yes, Your Honor.
The question of first impression that I referred to is
the statutory question of the proper construction of the sole
surviving son exemption which, fox' the first time in 1964, in­
cluded a reference to fathers, which it had not included befox*e.
Q

I misunderstood you.
22

A

Nor do we see anything in the cases that indi­

cates any distinction in this regard.

We submit that, therefore;

it is not inappropriate that the Ealbo doctrine be construet, to
| require that on all matters of classification, the administra-

1

tive agencies and the administrative process be given an oppor­
tunity to consider these questions in the first instance.
They weren’t given this opportunity hare.

Petitioner's

position is simply that he didn't want to have anything to do
with the Selective Service System.

The record makes this clear.

He repeatedly said that he just didn’t want to have anything to
do with it and wrote the Board and told them so.
He didn’t claim sole surviving son exemption himself.
The Board conferred it upon him.
Q

Perhaps he just inadvertently mentioned that his

father had been killed in World War II.
A

He mentioned this, Your Honor, and the Board then

responded and sent him a conscientious objector form because he
had also indicated that perhaps he had some reasons for filing
that sort of claim.

He wrote back and said no,

he didn’t, and

then wrote back and also said that he didn't even know if he was
a sole surviving son, but. his father had been killed in Wox*ld
War II.
The Board then proceeded to inquire further and ob­
tained information that confirmed the fact that he was a sole
surviving son because his father had been killed, as petitioner
23

t

stated.

2

Q

And his mother was still then alive.

3

A

And his mother was still then alive; yes,, Your
i

4

Honor.
Q

5

Then there is the suggestion that the construction

6

of the statute might depend upon whether or not there are other

7

relatives alive -— grandmothers, grandfathers.

8

the facts are in that respect?
A

9

It is not wholly clear.

The other aspect of petitioner's position, that there
is no need to reach the validity of the Falbo doctrine here, is
that it would have been futile in any event to pursue his admin­
istrative remedies.
24

1

We think that is simply not accurate on the facts.

The

2

administrative remedies that were available to him were, in the

3

first instance,, an appeal to the State Appeal Board.

4

from that decision, an appeal to the National Appeal Board if

5

(1) the State Appeal Board had been divided? or

'6

not been divided, he could have asked the State Director to take

7

the case to the National Board on his behalf.

8
9

Further,

(2) even had it

As the Court may recall, this is the situation that
exists in the Clay case, and there has been a consistent posi­

to

tion taken by the National and State Directors that questions of

11

importance in the System will be taken to the National Board on

12

behalf of registrants, even though they don"t have an appeal as

13

a right.

14

It seems to us that it would not have been futile here

15

for petitioner to seek to exhaust his administrative remedies.

16

He refers to the fact that advice was given by the National

17

Director and the State Director to his Local Board in response

18

to an inquiry to the effect that the pertinent section of the Ac!:P

19

section 60, should be construed as not allowing his statutory

20

exemption under the circumstances.

21

Well,

that is true.

But it is also true that the

22

National Director and the State Director are different people

23

from the State Appeal Board, .and certainly from the National

24

Appeal Board.

25

Board is an independent body, responsible only to the President,

It is clear by statute that the National Appeal

tion.

They are required under the law

So it seems to us that the fact that informal advice

9
10

was given by the National Director and the State Director on this

11

matter is not convincing.
There is one other aspect that petitioner seeks to

12
13

rely upon.

14

letin in August of 1964# shortly after the enactment of the

13

amendment which included for the first time fathers within the

10

category of those persons whose death may trigger the sole sur­

17

viving son exemption.

18
19

The National Director promulgated an operation bul­

That operation bulletin essentially took the position
that petitioner here argues as to the substantive issue.

20

Q

That the petitioner here what?

21

A

That he argues on the substantive issue; that is#

22

that the basic theory is one of preservation of lineage rather

23

than of compassion, or comfort, or whatever.

24
25

It seems to us that this is not convincing# either.
The very fact that the bulletin was withdrawn so promptly indica ;
26

1

that there was considerable uncertainty on the part of the

2

National Director, and moreover, all of the considerations that

3

I have mentioned just previously regarding the respective roles

4

of the National and State Directors and the State Appeal Board

5

and the National Appeal Board are applicable here as well.

6
7

Q

This conviction was for a failure to report for

induction or failure to report for a pre-induction physical?

8

A

Failure to report for induction.

9

Q

With respect to the physical exams, the system

10

is changed since the days of Estep and Falbo, has it not?

11

A

That is correct.

12

Q

In those days you didn't gat any physical until

13

you went down to report for induction? isn't that correct?

That is correct.

So the system since that time, with only minor

physicals roughly 60 to 90 days prior to the proposed induction
date and then if a man passes it, he is given an order to report
for induction.
Q

If he fails it, of course, he is classified IVThen at the time of induction there is another

That is correct.

That is pursuant to Army regu­

4

Q

That is an Army regulation.

S

A

At the induction station; yes, Your Honor.

6

Petitioner here received two orders to report for pre­

7

induction physicals.

He reported for neither one of them.

We

8

point out that one aspect, at least, of the Falbo doctrine is

9

that an individual potentially subject to the draft is required

10

to appear for a physical examination simply because a result of

11

that examination may be to preclude his induction.
Petitioner, by failing to report, failing to complete

12

13

the administrative processing that is required, precluded any

14

possibility of that aspect of the Falbo doctrine being relevant

IE

here.

16

We think, then, that petitioner’s challenge has to be

17

to the Falbo doctrine itself.

That doctrine, as the Court well

18

knows — it referred to that doctrine, as we understand, with

19

apparent approval in the Oestereich case, and Mr. Justice Harlan

20

also referred to it in his concurring opinion in Oestereich,

21

Falbo and Oestereich were also cited in the recent

subsequently to report for induction.

2

The premise on which this doctrine is grounded is not

3

one foreign to administrative lav/ generally.

4

that it has peculiar applicability in the Selective Service con­

S

text because the basic,, underlying notion of the Selective Serv­

cation.

14

vided, and in a time of national emergency, in a time of war, it

seems to us that if Falbo is overruled, there are some real

within the system itself, in the Wills case, which the petitioner

ground on which the Court of Appeals said, that it could excuse

exhaustion. In the Wills case, the notice of delinquency was not

sent to the registrant at the appropriate: time, and, therefore,

15

he was in a disadvantaged situation with respect to his classi”

16

fication because he wasn't apprised in a timely fashion.

17
18

As we read it, that is the basic

That sort of procedural irregularity has also been
allowed to excuse the exhaustion of administrative remedy.

19

In the Wolff case, the Court o£ Appeals for the Second

20

Circuit discussed at some length the Falbc doctrine, the exhaus­

21

tion of remedies doctrine in the Selective Service context and

22
23
24
25

found it inapplicable where serious First Amendment questions
were involved.
That involved an attempted delinquency reclassification
of registrants for sitting in at a Draft Board in Ann Arbor,
32

I

Michigan, and the Court there found that questions that they

2

raised under the First Amendment were comprehended under this

2

Court's doctrine in Dombrowski versus Pfister and, therefore,

4

an appropriate exception to the exhaustion rule could be per.

imitted.
Another exception that has been noted has to do with

whether the individual is aware of his administrative remedies,

as will be developed at greater length in the subsequent case,

The procedure that is established here is one that

seeks to make registrants amply aware of what rights they have.

I should note that subsequent to the operative facts
in this case, the pertinent regulations have been amended so
that now the registrant has 30 days instead of 10 days within
which to take an appeal to the State Appeal Board, the feeling

20

being that some.of these oases relating to exceptional circum­

21

stances have perhaps resulted because of the short period of

22

time that had previously been given.

23

We make a separate point of his failure to report for
pre-induction physicals.

As I noted, that is a precise aspect

of the Falbo holding itself.

5

A

I think it is important, as Justice Stewart

pointed out subsequent or shortly after Falfoo,

that the system

was changed so that pre-induction physicals are now required.
The purpose of that is so that each board will know ahead of
34

time what individuals it has available, physically qualified
individuals available, to meet each monthly call as it occurs»
So it seems to us that it is an important aspect of the system.
Otherwise, the board has no way of knowing what this individual's
situation or status is.
Therefore, we think there is an independent ground hers.
As petitioner notes, he wasn’t charged with failure to report
for a physical exam.

We realise that.

But in the context of the

applicability of the exhaustion doctrine, our point simply is
that this is another aspect that we think should be taken into
account.
Q

What is the chief disadvantage that you see would

result should the petitioner here prevail?
A

If petitioner prevails on the broad ground that

the Falbo doctrine should be overruled and, thei’efore, that
exhaustion of administrative remedies is no longer required, it
seems to me that there are at least two principal disadvantages
that would result.
One, the operation of the Selective Service System
itself would be subject to serious disruption because individual.1!
would not be required to pursues remedies through the system.
This elaborate machinery that Congress and the President have
established to consider and pass upon claims to classification
could be deliberately and effectively bypassed.

Indeed, that is

what petitioner sought to do here, we think? simply deliberately

35

11

bypass this whole system.

2>

Q

Would that greatly delay you?

3

A

It seems to us that it could very well create

44

very serious delays and disruption because there would be no way

5

of knowing if individuals did not pursue fcheir administrative

6t

remedies and if individuals did not report for pre-induction

T

physicals, from month to month those individuals who were avail­

8i

able .
The system is sat up not to put people in ja.il and to

9
10

prosecute them for violations of the Act* but to properly classi :y

11

and induct them into the service.

12

administrative machinery is directed toward that purpose of

13

insuring a proper classification and insuring that there is a

14

steady, continuous flow of manpower when needed for the Armed

15

Services„

16
17
18

It seems to us that the whole

It seems to us that if the exhaustion doctrine is
abandoned, that will be interfered with.
The other aspect, it seems to us, of this is simply

19

that when the administrative agencies are bypassed, the load of

20

litigation in the courts is commensurately increased.

21

are going to be forced to pass on these questions without any

22

gloss of administrative interpretation or construction, and with­

23

out screening and weeding out of cases that would be taken care

24

of through following the administrative process.

25

Q

The court:;

In Falbo and Estep, they were dealing with a

36

1

section of the statute which is quoted in Estep, 10(a)(2), which

2

says that "Decisions of local hoards shall be final except where

3

an appeal is authorised in accordance with such rules and regu­

4

lations as the President may prescribe."

5

Would you say Falbo and Estep really construe this

6

language to mean that at the very least, before you get judicial

7

review, you should exhaust these appellate procedures that are

8

prescribed by the President?
A

9
10

I think that is essentially what the court did

in those cases.
Q

Is that section still in the statute and remains

13

A

As I recall, that section is part of a long pro­

14

vision that

15

Q

But that language is still in the statute?

16

A

That is correct.

11

12

17

unchanged?

It was, of course, amended,

the whole long provision, 460(b)(3).

18

Q

But this language was left identical.

19

A

Yes, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, the Con­

20

gress ratified this Court's construction of that language in

21

the B’albo and Estep cases by providing that the no-basis-in-fact

22

standard should be the one that is applied in judicial review

23

here.

24
25

That, of course, is the provision that,the language that

Estep adopted in delineating the standard.
Q

If that suggests that the exhaustion doctrine

37

i

under Falbo and Estep is simply an interpretation of a section

2

that Justice White referred to, why isn't that the end of this

3

case?

4

interpretation of statutes that Congress can change overnight

3

if it chooses to.

Ordinarily, we don't overrule cases that turn on our

(6

A

I would like to think that that is the end of

8

Q

Why isn't it the end of the case?

9

A

As I understand it, it is not the end of the

the case.

10

case because over the years certain exceptions have been carved

11

out to this doctrine, and petitioner suggests that his case

12

fits within some of these exceptions.

13

Q

I see.

14

A

Our position is twofold;

One, these exceptions

15

are not applicable here,» and in any event, the Falbo doctrine

16

should be upheld.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Pontikes?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE C. PONTIKES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19
20

MR. PONTIKES;

21

May it please the Court, I just want to cover some of

22

.

Thank you.

the matters that were raised by the Government.
Again, I must insist to the Court that we are not seek

23
24

ing to overrule the position taken by this Court in Falbo and

25

Estep.
38

V

It seems to us fundamental that there is a crucial

2\

distinction to be drawn between the Falbo-Sstep situation where

31

a local board snakes certain factual determinations, comes to a

M

conclusion, and then there is a requirement that there be an

S:

exhaustion and the taking of a physical.,

8

In that particular case, you do not have a question of

7

pure statutory construction that you have in this case»

8

no factual dispute in this case whatsoever.

9

decision that the system had to make at all.

10

There is

There is no factual
It ti?as a pure ques ­

tion of law.
'Further, as the courts have recognized, where an admin­

11

IE

istrative process, or the taking of administrative appeals would

13

be futile, then the aggrieved party is not required to take

14

those administrative processes.

15

Now, for the Government to tell us here that the State

1G

Appeal Board is going to operate independently of the directions

17

of the National Director is really to fly in the face of reality
I call your attention to the Wolff case.

18

Specifically,

ID

in the case of Wolff, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found

20

that the national — as you recall, in that case the registrants

21

who filed the suit asking for pre-induction relief had not ex­

2E

hausted any administrative remedies whatsoever.

23

reclassified by their local boards, and they thereupon went in

24

asking for a declaratory judgment to declare that their classi­

25

fications were invalid and based upon unconstitutional considera­
tions .

39

They had been

In Wolff, the Court fo>’ *o. that the National Director

1

2

lad clearly stated his position and they round other condi ‘-ions

3

:o .indicate that the system had already maae up its nund,,

4
5

rould say the same conditions apply here.

The system had made

ip its mind, and for the Coverto tell us now —
q

(6
7

he

is with respect to who is a sole surviving

ion.
£

8

correct.

Very much, Justice Stewart.

I would say

:nat the possibilities of a State Appeal Board overturning or
10

:lying in the face of this construction of the statute would be,

11

„f not impossible, certainly practically impossible.
Secondly, as far as the case reaching the National

12

13

14
15
1G

Selective Service Appeal Board, I would point out to the Court
that by ths statistics of the Government itself, there were only

479 split decisions heard by the National Selective Service
Appeal Boari.

A split decision is a decision where there is a

disvent on . State Appeal Board.

This is in the first six

of 1158.

1£

~n hi;cal 1967, the State Appeal Boards heard 119,167

IS
2C

cases.

21

you get an idea of how possible it is, first of all, for this

22

case ever x> have reached the National Appeal Board.

23
24
25

8c if you tales those two figures and put them together,

Secondly, even though the cases indicate some dis­
agreement with the National and State Director, there is no show
ing that thr; cases decided by the National Board were decided on
40

1

questions of legal interpretation of the statute.

We would rath?

2

assume that they were questions in which there were factual

3

determinations made in disagreement with the National Director

4

and the State Director.
Q

.5

Dees it have any bearing that all of the points

©

that are being argued now, in the actuality of this situation,

7

as far as your client is concerned, were purely beside the point:

S

He just said he was washing his hands of the whole Selective

©

Service System.

10
11
12

.

A

That was the point that I made at the outset.

Q

I realize that.

Is that ;just an ad hominem argu­

ment , or has it got soma bearing on this?
A

13

I don’t think the fact that the petitioner dis­

14

liked the Selective Service or had moral convictions about its

15

operations and felt compelled not to cooperate with it, that

16

that fact has any bearing on whether he had to exhaust his admin­

17

istrative remedies, because it seems to me the question of ex­

18

haustion is dependent on issues that are wholly unrelated to his

19

particular attitude.
Furthermore, as far as forcing some kind of compliance

20
21

by not upholding the petitioner's position in this case, peti­

22

tioner was not reading Supreme Coiirt decisions.

23

not to cooperate was based wholly upon his own moral considera­

24

tions.

25

that is the reason I don’t think the two are related at all, in

His decision

It had nothing to do with what might happen to him, so

41

1

any sense, either practically or legally,

2

Q

Let us assume that his mother was still alive

3

but he just didn't do anything, didn't even inadvertently inform

4

his Local Board that his father had been killed in World War II.

5

A

All right.

There I think we have the Pickens

6

versus Cox situation.

7

Q

What is that?

8

A

Which is a sole surviving son drafted into the

8

Army without giving any information to his board whatsoever,

10

and thereupon, after court martial, seeking by way of habeas

11

corpus to be released on the grounds that there was no juris­

12

diction to take him into the Army in the first place.
There I think the Pickens court rightly held that under

13

14

those circumstances he had waived his right.

15

the Court here —
Q

16
17

!8

I point out to

Let us say even here, if he had not gotten so

far as Mr. Pickens or Mr. Cox, whichever it was, but had simply
refused to be inducted, had refused an. induction order, and had

19

then been criminally prosecuted, as your client was, and then

20

had said, "Look, I am a sole surviving son,"

21

would have responded, "Well, you didn't pursue any administrative

22

remedies."

Then the Governmen ::

23

What would the story have been there?

24

A

25

I think there it wouldn't be a question so much

of exhaustion, but of the fact that he had completely waived his
42

1

right to even claim that exemption because he had not supplied

2

the information at all.
Q

3*

•

4»

Isn't this pretty close to that kind of a case

in the light of my brother Harlan's question?
A

S'

I would say no* for the following reason:

When

©

he was asked to supply this information, he did not feel that

7

this was a violation of his moral principles, so he did supply

8

the information.
If you will look — I don't have the exhibit number

9
10

handy — but you will note when he was sent a specific ques­

11

tionnaire asking for the name of his father, the date of death

12

and other relevant information, all of this he readily supplied

13

because he felt this wa.s not a form of cooperation which would

14

violate his moral position.

15

it and, therefore, I don't really think the issue is in the

16

case here.

17
18
19

20
21

22

25

Q

So in that sense he did not waive

What worries me is that you say you are absolutely

certain that an appeal would be futile.

Do you also say that

it is absolutely certain that the examining doctors will find
him physically fit?
A

Certainly not, but this Court fated that same

position in Oestereich, Justice Marshall, and there .they did not
require Oestereich to take a physical.
Q

I just wanted to know whether you were going to

go that far.
