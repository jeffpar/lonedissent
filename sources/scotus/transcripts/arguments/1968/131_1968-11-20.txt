This hearing is on a writ of certiori to the Supreme

Court of Florida.

By way of background, on February 6, 1965,

11

at about 7:30 in the morning a small grocery store in Dade County,

12

Florida, was robbed.

13

that they had about one to two minutes' time to observe the

14

robbery.

One of the prosecuting witnesses indicated

before a magistrate.

23

3, 1965, some eight days later, at which time the petitioner was

again identified by the son of the manager of the grocery store.

For ten days the petitioner was held without being

benefit of counsel and not until petitioner had secured counsel

5

with armed robbery.

At the trial of this case the sole evidence used against

him was this lineup evidence, this illegal lineup evidence of the

made a lineup where there were no small people in the lineup

except the petitioner.

20

he picked out the smallest person in the lineup which, we say,

goes to the dubious reliability of the lineup.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Goldman, you may

continue your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP PHILIP GOLDMAN, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER (eonfc’d)
MR.

gOLDMANs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, I believe we recessed at the point where the
defendant had b«en convicted by the trial ■«©»■*“ •:,

Appeal was

taken to the First District Court of Appeal, which would in
Florida be the final appellate court.
That court's opinion, after reviewing the sequence
of events, showed on the face of it that it was upset with
the wrongs done the petitioner.
Without attempting to be facetious in any manner,
that court concluded that under the doctrine, they had
previously approved matters where men had not been taken before
a magistrate timely while evidence had been gathered against
them.

They were firm on that basis.
They had some reservations and under the Florida

constitution, Article

5t

Section 4f they certified the

question to the Supreme Court of Florida on the question of
great public interest.
The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed again and
they answered the question that had been propounded to them
S

i

!

1

and this court also reviewed the sequence of events and

2

concluded that the petitioner had been wronged.

3

The Supreme Court of Florida went on the basis that

4

it was harmless error that he had not been harmed or had not

S

been prejudiced anci I really do not understand how this result

6

could be reached in the face of the fact that all of the

7

evidence adduced at the trial was evidence that was developed

8

during the unlawful detention.

9

The court also noted that the petitioner had not

10

requested to be taken before a magistrate and based its

11

decision in part on that.

12

is silent and* as this court has stated in the Carniey •

13

decision* waiver cannot be inferred,, is not permissive from

14

a silent record, and the record here is silent.

15

Actually the record on this point

Also, in the Carniey " case the court pointed out

16

itfifch respect to assistance of counsel, the assistance of

17

counsel dees not turn on request, and I respectfully submit

18

that by analogy, the right to a hearing before a magistrate

19

should not turn upon a request.

20

Actually in its brief before this court the state

21

continues to rely on the fact of a lack of prejudicial

22

error and, as X submitted before,, if this man had been taken

23

before a magistrate as required by law under Section ©01,23

24

of the Florida statute or if it became a constitutional

25

mandate, he would have had to be turned loose because all of
9

/

1

the evidence used against him was gathered after that took

2

place.
The only other point is the point suggested by Mr.

3
4

Justice Stewart that perhaps there had been misidentifieation.

5

As I pointed out, in this record there was no identification

6

of a photograph of this particular individual.
Q

7

It is not part of your submission, however, as 1

8

understand it, that this arrest was made without any proper

9

cause, is it?

11

A

using the case.

12

13
14

It is not a part, in other words, we are not

Q

You do not claim this was an illegal arrest,

A

That's right.

do you?
Our major point is that the

15

McNabb-Mallory rule should be applied to state court

16

proceedings as a constitutional mandate.

17

As this court knows, the McNahb-Mallory rule stems

18

from a decision of this court which holds that if a defendant

19

is unlawfully detained in violation of rule 5(a) under

20

criminal rules of procedure, evidence gathered during that

21

time cannot be used and conviction based upon such evidence

22

will be reversed.

23
24
25

Similar provisions in the form of legislation
requiring that an arrested person being taken before a magis­
trate exist in practically every state of the union.
10

I have a

collection of footnotes of those in our brief.

Interestingly

enough, as I pointed out in ray brief, many,, many states ignore
this as the Florida case does.

As a matter of fact, 1 am sure

the Attorney General can tell us since this decision, the
Supreme Court of Florida has in a number of cases continued to
ignore the provisions of 901.23.
Although the McNabb-Mallory rule has been a rule
applicable to Federal court proceedings,
interesting

I think it is an

coincidence in the case of Milton versus Cochran,

which is a Supreme Court of Florida case, the Supreme Court
recited that if it didn't start to do something about stopping
these failures to take men before a magistrate, this court or
some other Federal court would adopt the Me Na bb-Ma11ory rule
and, without attempting to be facetious,

I respectfully

suggest the time has come to make a profit out of the Supreme
Court of Florida because the McNabfo-Mallory rule is an
essential part of due process.
In the McMabb case Mr. Justice Frankfurter makes
an eloquent exposition as to the rationale of that case the
public policy behind the rule.
Certainly due process requires that the police must
with reasonable promptness show a legal cause for retaining
an arrested person.

This is an important safeguard not only

to constricting the innocent but toward actually constricting
the g-uilty in an enlightened society,

11
i

This rationale of these cases apply certainly to
state court proceedings.

1 think it is also interesting that ir

both McMabb and Mallory decisions this court did not reject
the constitutional concept.

It says it wasn't 'getting to it,

in other words, it didn't reach the constitutional question
and decided it was a question of legislative intent and
construction and interpretation of rule SC®5.

G

Mr. Goldman, even if the court should accept

completely your submission that the McNabb~Mallory rule
should become a constitutional rule, that would not automatical!
win your case for you, would it, because it is necessary to go
one step beyond that?

McHabb and Mallory themselves involved

admission of statements made by a mart in custody before and
who was not brought before a magistrate within a reasonable
time.

Are there any Federal cases?
A

The Krapholz case cited is in Second District

Court, which this court denied search and seizure.
an argument made by the state, too.

This is

It is true that both

McHabb and Mallory were confession cases but in fairness,
because I am an advocate, but in attempting to be objective
in reading it, the rationale of those decisions is unlawful
detention.

In other words, this court has never held that

confession per se is illegal.

It is only confession

gathered under certain circumstances which is illegal and
the circumstance of McNabb-Mallory is violation of rule 5(a).
12

Certainly there is nothing in either of those
decisions that indicates that if the tainting was something
other than a confession* that a different result would be
reached,, but there is that difference in the cases, yes, your
Honor.
How 2 think, as this court knows, the purpose of a
preliminary hearing is to weed out groundless or
unsupported charges of grave offenses and to relieve an
accused of the degradation and expense of a criminal trial.
Certainly a quick determination of probable cause
is a necessity in any scheme of due process.
hearing also serves another purpose.

A preliminary

It gives an opportunity

for bail 'which is, of course, a constitutional right.

It

gives an opportunity for counsel being appointed or being
retained V7hich is also a constitutional right.
The fact that so many of our states, practically
all of our states have enacted legislation in effect adopting
rule 5(a) as part of their ovm statutes is indicative of the
extent to which this is engrained in our concept of due
process of law.
We respectfully submit that under decisions of
this court certainly the due process provisions require that
a state afford a defendant due process of lav?, not only during
the period of the formal trial but throughout his entire
accusatory period.

I think that was the Escobedo case.

13

We are suggesting it is a part of that due process
which requires that a man be taken before a magistrate within
a reasonable period of time.

In some cases you might have an

exploration of outer orbits of what constitutes a reasonable
period of time.
I submit you don't have to decide that now because
ten days is certainly an unreasonable period of time.

The

record here reflects when counsel asked the police officer,
he said, "Are you aware of the statute requiring you to take
him before a magistrate?"
"Why didn't you do it?"

And he said,

"Yes, sir."

He said,

He said, "Well, it was 2s30 in the

morning."
The record is silent as to why he didn't do it the
next day or the next day or the next day after that for ten
days when they still didn't do it.
This idea of a constitutional requirement of the
McNabb-Mallory rule is not as unique as it might sound at
first blush.

This court has in many instances in cases we

cited in our brief reversed state court convictions where
the persons were unlawfully held incommunicado without advice
of counsel or friend.
That by analogy is also appropriate here.
was actually held incommunicado for ten days.

This man

The case of

Watts versus Indiana, which Mr. Justice Marshall will
recognise, although this court did not expressly apply the
14

McNabb-Mallory rule, it came very close to it in reversing
the state court conviction and one of the grounds cited
was that a preliminary hearing as required 'toy laws of
Indiana had not been given»
We respectfully submit that this should be a part
of due process.

It will probably be urged that the application

of the MoNabb-Ma1lory rulein state court proceedings is going
to hamper effective lav; enforcement.

That seems to be the

present cry these days.
I respectfully submit that nothing could foe further
from the truth.

As this court knows* the Federal Bureau of

Investigation has had to live with the McNabfo-Mallory rule
for over 15 years and they still remain one of the most
effective law enforcement organizations in this country.
Actually with respect to the lineups, the language
of this court in the Wade case is singularly appropriate here.
In that case the court points out the vagaries of a witness
identification.

Here there was from one to two minutes an

opportunity to observe,
The case points out the fact that criminal law
history is rife with

instances of mistaken identification

and difficulty with identifying strangers.
I think the part that is singularly applicable hare
is the part where this court points out that it is a matter
of common experience that once a person has made up his mind.
15

nothing can change it, so identification takes place
actually at pre-trial rather than trial.
We respectfully submit that under this case the
McNabb-Mallory case should apply end I think it fits.

In

I fairness to this client, 1' wish to urge that if this court
in its wisdom does not think the McNabb-Ma1lory rule should
be applied, then 1 suggest the totality of circumstance rule
which this court has applied in other instances requires
a reversal under mandate of the 14th amendment to the
constitution.
Certainly the facts in this case, the taking of the
man from his home at night, Is30 in the morning, over a
month after the crime was committed, subjecting him to two
lineups over a ten-day period without counsel, without benefit
I of a magistrate, all of these facts together constitute in my
judgment a monstrous affront to the dignity of man and this
conviction should be reversed,
Q

What was the conviction for?

A

Armed robbery conviction, 20 years in prison.

That completes my submission.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD MEKDELGW, ESQ.
OK? BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR,, MENDELOWs

Mr.- Chief Justice and may it please

the court, I wish to apologise to Mr. Justice Stewart if at
16

any time

in reading the factual declaration by the state in

its brief he has come to the conclusion that the State of
Florida meant to say that the photographs shown to the victim
in this case were identified by him as the petitioner.

If we

did say that* we apologias.
Q

I think 1 understand you to say on page 10 of

your brief.
A

Yes, sir, we did say that and we wish to

apologias to the court at this time for that statement.
Q

What is the fact?

A

The fact is that he did pick out a picture and

that is the extent of the record, your Honor, but we feel and
in our argument we have so stated that the—
Q

He picked out a picture?

A

A picture but it does not designate that he

picked out a picture of the petitioner in this matter.
Q

What you are telling ns now is that the picture

he picked out was someone other?
A

We do not know, sir.

The record is not clear.

Q

The record simply doesn't show, am 1 right in

my understanding, that at no time has there been any claim
that the arrest was illegal?
A

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart, and at no

time was it raised on direct appeal and at no time was it
raised on the certified question culminating in the petition

17

1

for certiorari.

2

Q

For that reason there was no canvassing of the

3

issues as to what probable cause there might have been with

4

respect to the knowledge of the arresting officer?
A

3

Other than what is reflected in the record per se I

S

and v;e submit that from this record it can be gleaned that

7

there was sufficient probable cause to make an arrest.

requires the state to show what he was being held for?

I would think it would, your Honor.

3

Q

And in this case it does not show if?

4

A

Mot specifically per se in the record,

5

Q

What in the record helps you on this point?

6

A

The fact that he was arrested and 25 hours after

7

his arrest a lineup was held and the victim of the particular

8

robbery that he was arrested for came in and picked him out of

9

a six-man lineup.

10
11
12

Q

Did he pick him out or did he pick the shortest

man out who was there?
A

Mr. Justice Marshall, there were two lineups

13

held in this case.

The first lineup was the six-man lineup

14

held 25 hours after arrest of the petitioner.

15

nothing in this record that depicts exactly how many short men

m

or tall men or fat men or skinny men were in this lineup.

record is completely void of any reference to the description

18

of any of the particular six men in this particular lineup.

There was a subsequent lineup held six days later

There is

headquarters and picked the petitioner out of a lineup

illegal arrest in this case?

That is correct.

There still isn’t as far as

We feel that the record

thing that 2 can safely say that the record reflects.
i wish to also take issue with one fact that has

been insisted upon by petitioner.

evidence, the sole evidence that petitioner's conviction

16

was based upon was the identification that occurred at the

That is that the sole

This identification was then made in court based on

19

that description and based upon seeing the petitioner in

court.

21

Q

What I am trying to get at«were the facts of the

22

lineup brought out on direct examination or on cross

23

examination ?

24
25

A

Initially they were brought out on direct

examination and then they were brought out on cross
22

examination but they were brought out, we submit, on direct

2

examination merely for corroboration and not for the primary-

3

identification of the petitioner in this manner.

I will submit, Mr. Justice Fortas, that nothing

other than two lineups we re held.

n

Q

Two lineups?

12

A

That is correct.

13

Q

Is there any evidence in this record of

14
15

prolonged questioning?
A

There is no evidence in the record, in the

16

record in fact and the appendix which is before the court,

17

that indicates any questioning in any way, manner or form,

18

nor was petitioner’s conviction based upon any inculpatory

19

statement or exculpatory statements or any admission or any

20

statement whatsoever made by him while in custody.

21

Q

That is what is sort of baffling about this

23

that a man was kept in jail for ten days in apparent violation

of a Florida statute which requires him to be taken before

I would like to address

4

myself a little later in my argument concerning the violation

or the technical violation of Florida statute 901.23.

S

Q

Am 2 correct or incorrect in recalling that the
!

7

court below seems to agree that it is a violation of the

3

Florida statute but says that, number one, it indicates that

9

maybe the remedy is not to set aside the conviction; number two,

10

that it is not projudicial?

11

A

Basically you are correct, Mr. Justice Fortas.

12

1 will try to refine that a little bit in the course of my

13

argument, if 2 may.

14

Q

Thank you,

15

A

Petitioner asks this court to extend the

16

McNabb-Ma1lory rule and make it applicable to the states and

17

also make it applicable to confessions, we submit that this

18

would be a double extension.

19

Q

You mean make it applicable to a lineup!

20

A

Excuse me.

Make it applicable to a lineup.

1

21

am sorry.

22

a rule that was initially promulgated by Congress as a Federal

| 23

We submit that this would be a double extension of

rule of criminal procedure and treated by this court in its

24

supervisory powers over the Federal courts and criminal

25

procedure requirements of Federal prosecutions.
24

The rule as

1

effectuated by the cases of McNabfo versus United States

2

and Mallory versus United States make it clear that its prime

3

purpose was to alleviate the evils arising out of secret

4

interrogations* secret interrogation,

5

cases that 1 'have been able to research decided by this court

6

has the rule been used other than in confession cases.

7

Nowhere in any of the

Nowhere have I been able to determine that this

8

rule has ever been made applicable to the states.

9

this court many times and in many cases has stated that this

10

11

In fact*

is a rule of Federal criminal procedures and it is not
applicable to the states.
Further* we say that the void* which there is a

12
13

void* that is created by not making this rule applicable to

14

the states has been filled* the breach has been filled by

15

decisions of this court whereby the constitutional rights of

16

the accused have been looked after and made applicable to

17

state prosecutions and has protected the accused in every

18

stage that would be applicable to this case* and we cite to

19

the court starting with Ashcraft versus Tennessee which this

20

court stated that the detention in a confession case is

21

inherently dangerous in a confession case.

22

Then we have the Mapp case which protects the

23

accused in illegal search and seizure cases* even if the

24

illegal search and seizure is during detention.

25

Wong Sun

We have the

case where if there is primary illegality and
25

i

1

taint has not been purged, that any evidence secured as a

2

result of that primary illegality is excludable.

3

We have the Escobedo case* the Massdah case, the

A

Miranda case:. Which certainly afford the accused the protection

3

of the 5th and 6th Amendments to the United States

8

Constitution in confession cases.

7

We have Wade and Gilbert and Stovall that are

8

particularly applicable to this case where the only evidence

9

secured is that of identification by lineup.

And both

10

petitioner and respondent do agree that the right to counsel

11

in lineups is here today and it has been here since

12

June 12* 1967* but that ruling in the Stovall decision makes

13

it only prospective and not retroactive.

14

Q

Mr. Mendelow* do you know of a case where the

15

Supreme Court of Florida has said that failure to comply with

13

the statute requiring that an accused be taken before a

17

magistrate is ground for reversalof a criminal case?

18

A.

Eo cases, to my knowledge* has ever been

20

Q

What good is the statute if it is not followed?

21

A

Your Honor* the Supreme Court of Florida has

19

decided.

22

consistently held that a preliminary hearing is not a

23

critical stage in a criminal prosecution case* and may I

24

explain why.

23

Tine Florida criminal procedure statute which
26

i

requires an accused who is arrested without a warrant to be

2

taken before a committing magistrate without unnecessary

3

delay, that preliminary hearing resulting from that statute

4

would only be a preliminary hearing according to our

5

statute to decide probable cause of the charges.

8
7
3
9

Q

No question about appointing counsel or

A

I assume that is what the magistrate would do

anything ?

when accused is presented before him.

I am only

10

interpreting the literal expression of the statute, but I

11

would assume a magistrate who has an accused brought before

12

him would advise him of his right to bail, hi-s right to

13

counsel, and his right that anything he might say would be

14

used against him.

15
16

17

Q

I don't know the answer, but Mr. Goldman said

that this man was held incommunicado.
A

I don’t believe the record reflects that.

He

18

was held pursuant to lawful arrest and that is all I can say

19

to this court and that is all that I feel the record reflects.

20
21

22

Q

On what charge was he booked?

Was it for

investigation ?
A

Mr. Justice Marshall asked me that question a

23

little while ago.

1 am afraid 1 didn’t have the answer, Mr.

24

Justice Portas.

23

booked for the crime for which he was ultimately tried.

I can only assume from the record he was

27

1

Q

You don’t know whether that is so or not?

2

A

Well,

I do not know, but the only thing 1 can

3

infer from the record is that 25 hours after his arrest he

4

was placed in a lineup and the victim of this particular

5

robbery that lie was arrested for was called down to identify

6

someone.

7

Q

You also said in response to Justice Marshall's

3

question, as I understand it,- that there are no cases under

9

this Florida statute?

10

A

Yes, there are.

11

Q

What is the maximum period of detention?

12

long can a person be held without being charged or taken

13

before a magistrate?

14

the Florida case law?

15

A

How

Is there any indication as to that in

I just do not have the answer for you, Mr.

16

Justice Fortas.

circumstance this particular statute has not been held to be

IS

a critical part.

19

critical part in my understanding is where at a preliminary

20

hearing the accused has pled guilty and then had withdrawn

21

his plea of guilty prior to trial and that evidence was

22

sought to be introduced against him, the guilty plea at the

23

preliminary hearing, and that the Florida Supreme Court has

said this was critical.
But as far as the time or amount of time after

23

1

arrest and before arraignment} to my knowledge or at least

2

at this time I cannot cite to you a case which would say how

3

much time would be allowable.

4

Q

A while ago you indicated that the issue of

5

illegal arrest had not been raised.

6

raised before the trial judge both in the oral motion and

7

•written motion?

I gather it really was

8

A

Yes» it was before the trial court.

9

Q

And it was denied.

A

On direct appeal.

Q

I don't find a mention of it in the District

Where did that occur?

I
12

Court of Appeals® opinion.

13

A

That is correct, because it wasn't presented.

14

Q

Was that point raised anywhere in those courts?

15

A

Not to my knowledge.

The point raised in the

16

District Court was the detention and sufficiency and the

17

certified questioning to the Florida Supreme Court was

18

merely on the detention aspect of the case.

19

0
21

Q

In Florida, if at a preliminary hearing it was

found there was no probable cau.se to hold a person over for
trial, does that prove he was illegally arrested?
t

22

A

No, because there are many, many circumstances

3

why a magistrate would say there would be no probable cause.

4

However<j 1 would like to discuss with the court the factor

5

that even if petitioner was brought before a committing
9

1

magistrate and he was released toy this committing magistrate!

2

under the Florida procedure and under procedure approved by

3

this court in Beck versus Washington! the assistant or the

4

state attorney’s office or state prosecuting official for

5

Florida would still bring formal charges against the

6

petitiones.

7

I don’t know what would happen at the preliminary

3

hearing but suppose additional evidence was brought in.

9

on the same evidence I would make that statement»

10

Q

But they couldn't be arrested?

11

h

They could be arrested.

Even

We could arrest them*

12

yes* sir* on capias issued by the state attorney's office

13

after he had been discharged toy the committing magistrate.
Further, counsel for petitioner has stated that

14
15

there was no probable cause and surely the committing

16

magistrate would have released the petitioner.

17

this is a point that X think is very important under a due

!8

process argument, let us suppose that after the petitioner

19

was arrested, he was brought before the committing magistrate

20

and this victim who had given such a clear and precise

21

description to the officers in the case had appeared at the

22

preliminary hearing and had pointed to the petitioner and

23

said,

24
25

I say, and

"Yes, this is the man who robbed me."
We ask the court, which would be moresusceptible to

suggestive identification, that one-on-one confrontation
30

1

before the magistrate or the procedure that was used in the

2

instant case where the victim had to point the particular

3

petitioner out of a six-man lineup.

4

We feel that due process was not violated here by

5

requiring the petitioner to stand in a six-man linup 25 hours

6

after his arrest.
Q

7

Wouldn’t this language in the Opinion of the

8

Court of Appeals indicate that they did challenge the probable

9

cause for arrest?

It says:

"Xt is urged that if the directions of the statute

10
11

had been followed; the magistrate would have been required

12

to release the defendant for lack of probable cause to retain

13

defendant in jail.

14

against the defendant was procured at the jail subsequent to

15

the time at which appellant would have been released if he

16

had been taken before a magistrate."
Wouldn't that indicate that it was raised in that

17
13

19

It is pointed out that the evidence

court ?
A

It was raised in that court the same way that

20

it was raised here; your Honor, and in the Supreme Court of

21

Florida on the basis that speculatively the petitioner would

22

have been released.

23
24
25

Q

It is pure speculation and nothing more.

2 understood you to say that it was not raised

except in the trial court.
A

The actual lawfulness or illegality of the arrest
31

1

per se was not raised except in the trial court»

2

We submit, respectfully so, that the petitioner

3

was not prejudiced in any way, manner or form by his not feeing

4

taken before a committing magistrate immediately after his

5

arrest.

6

arrest still existed and he could have been charged and

7

rearrested by the state prosecuting officials, and, number two,

8

a prosecution could have been forthcoming based on that

9

information, and, number three, his conviction, and this

One, because the probable cause necessary for his

10

perhaps is the most important aspect of the case, his

11

conviction was not based on the lineup identification solely.

12

His conviction was based on the in-court identifi­

53

cation independent of any lineup identification that was

14

subsequently made after his arrest and that is clear from the

15

record,

16

Therefore, if his prosecution was not dependent

17

upon the lineup and his conviction was not dependent on the

18

lineup, how can we say that the petitioner was prejudiced by

19

not being brought before a committing magistrate?

20

There is just no cause or connection between the

21

prosecution or the conviction and his not being brought before

22

a committing magistrate in the opinion of the respondent in

23

this matter.

24

Therefore, we respectfully submit that the McMabb-

25

Mallory rule to be extended to the states under this factual
32

1

circumstance and situation would be a double extension

2

and not necessarily called for by the factual situation in

3

this case.

4

Further* we respectfully submit that the

5

petitioner's conviction was not in any way based upon his not

6

being brought before a committing magistrate.

7

ask this court to affirm the decision of the Supreme Court

8

of the State of Florida in this cause.
