MR. HENDERSON:

Mr. Henderson.

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
I am Philip Henderson from Houma, Louisiana.
In this case, there is presented the issue of whether
the Death on the High Seas Act is the exclusive remedy for
wrongful death occurring to one of the workers on the artificial
islands, the fixed platform, in the Outer Continental Shelf off
the coast of Louisiana in this case.
Actually before the Court today are two cases that
came here on a joint petition

for writ of certiorari.

The two

cases present exactly the same issue.
In the Paulette Boudreaux Rodrigue case she is suing,
she and her children are suing for the death of her husband.
Butley Rodrigue fell from the top of a derrick to his death on
the drilling platform floor.
It is alleged that the death was caused by the neg­
ligence of the operator of the platform and the drilling company
2

1
2

In the Dore case, let me continue and bring the
Rodrigue case up to the Court»

3

For the death, Mrs. Rodrigue brought actually three

4

suits o

5

Act.

6

She brought one suit under the

Death on the High Seas

This suit was broad in admiralty. (?)
She brought two civil actions claiming that the

7

Lotiisiana Death Act which was the adjacent state in this case*

8

the Rodrigue death occurred on a platform which was 28 miles

9

seaward of the coast of Louisiana.

10

In the civil actions, Mrs. Rodrigue contended that

11

the Louisiana Death Act was extended to these artificial islands

12

by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which specifically

13

provides that the law of the adjacent State shall be extended

14

to the artificial islands in the Outer Continental Shelf and

15

shall be applied when not inconsistent with Federal law.

1G

The cases were consolidated.

Motions were filed by

17

the defendant to dismiss all of the claims actually contending

18

that one or the other was an exclusive remedy.

19

denied all mentions.

20

to hear the civil actions, the judge to hear the admiralty

21

action concurrently.

22

The Trial Judge

The case was fixed for trial with the jury

On the morning of the trial after the jury was im­

23

paneled, the Judge changed his mind and granted a motion to

24

dismiss the civil actions.

A

Now, when the trial judge dismissed the two

6

civil actions he held that the exclusive remedy for death on

7

the artificial islands was the Outer Continental Shelf Lands

8

Act»

Excuse me»
Q

9

Was the Death on the High Seas Act,

Is there any question — is there any issue

10

between the parties here as a matter of fact that as to whether

11

or not this artificial island was within the contours of the

12

Outer Continental Shelf geographically?

13

A

Hone whatsoever»

14

Q

Ho dispute?

15

A

Ho dispute about that as to either the Boudreaux

16

Rodrigue case or the Dubois Dore case.
Now, both platforms were within the Continental Shelf

17
18

and both were adjacent to the State of Louisiana.

ID

was taken for the dismissal of the civil actions to the Fifth

20

Circuit.

21

An appeal

In the Dubois Dore case, Mr. Dore was a crane operator

22

on one of these artificial islands or platforms, the crane

23

collapsed, Mr. Dore fell to his death.

24
25

For his death, his widow and children brought suit,
a single action, claiming as one cause of action a right under
5

1

the Death on the High Seas Act and also claimed rights under

2

the Louisiana Death Act.
The Louisiana Death Act allows recompense for not

3
4

only the pecuniary losses but also recompense for loss of love,

5

affection and companionship.
The Death on the High Seas Act only allows a recom­

6
7

pense for pecuniary losses.
In the Dubois Dore case the defendant at the District.

a
3
10

Court level filed a motion to strike the Louisiana cause of
action and to strike all claims for non-pecuniary damages.
The District Judge granted this motion and then

11
12

certified the questions raised in the motion to the Fifth

13

Circuit so that actually the Dore case reached the Fifth

14

Circuit before the Rodrigue case though both involved exactly

15

the same issue.
In tha Fifth Circuit, the Court held that the ex­

1G
17
'18
10

20
21

clusive remedy for death was the Death on the High Seas Act.
This Court has granted certiorari.

followed the Dore case very promptly.

24
25

Accordingly, the

Rodrigue case issued a procuring opinion and said simply refer
t;o our decision in the Dore case.
It is our contention that the Fifth Circuit erred

22
23

The Rodrigue case actually

in holding that the Death on the High Seas Act is the exclusive
remedy.

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act specifically

extends the law of the adjacent State to the particular islands
6

1

and it is to be applied where not inconsistent with Federal

E

law.

3

Now, the holding that the Death on the High Seas Act

4

was an exclusive remedy is clearly in error because the Death

5

on the High Seas Act specifically provides that it is not an

6

exclusive remedy.

7

Section 7 of the Death oh the High Seas Act reads,

3

"The provisions of any State statute giving or regulating

9

rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by

10

this chapter."
Now, it is hard to see how anything could be clearer

11

12
13

than that.
Now, at the time of the adoption of the Death on

14

the High Seas Act there were state statutes which were con-

15

strued as giving rights of action for death on the high seas.

«6

The most famous of these cases was the Hamilton.

17

happened to be a case, the E„ B. Ward, Jr., which was a Fifth

13

Circuit Court

19

Death Act that is at issue here to a death which occurred in

20

a collision between two vessels in the Gulf of Mexico.

21

Also, there

of Appeals case applying the very same Louisiana

Both of these cases were on the books at the time of

22

the adoption of the Death on the High Seas Act.

23

this specific statement in the Death on the High Seas Act that

24

it shall not affect the rights given by State statutes is

25

highlighted by legislative history.

7

The clarity of

f

At the time of this bill, it was a Senate bill when

2

it was in the House just before passage, at that time there

3

was debate as to whether the Act should be an exclusive remedy»

4

At that point, Section 7, which I have just read to

S

you, provided that the provisions of any State statute giving

6

or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not

7

be affected by this act as to causes of action accruing within

8

the territorial limits of any State»

0

Now, that made it clear that there was a limitation

10

upon this, what the Act was going to affect»

11

last words as to causes of action accruing within the limits

12

of any State were deleted after arguing and after debate»

13

were deleted so that the Act would read that the provisions of

14

any State statute giving or regulating rights of action or

15

remedies for death shall not be affected by this act, without

1G

any limiting feature»

17

However, those

They

13

people who debated said that this Act

19

Some said that it shouldn't»

20

amendment was 201 in favor of the amendment to 75 against it»

21

should be exclusive»

Actually, the final vote on the
/

Counsel for Respondent seemed to take comfort from

22

the fact that some of the persons who debated gave some reasons

23

why they thought the amendment shouldn't be passed or if it

24

passed, it didn't make any difference, but the fact is that

25

there were 201 as opposed to 75 of the legislators who voted
8

1

for this amendment so that the Act would plainly read that the

2

provisions of any State statute giving os: regulating rights of

3

action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this Acte

4

It couldn't be plainer.

Q

I wonder how far you carry that»

Suppose 20

G

miles out at sea from the Coast of Louisiana, but on a direct

7

line, say disaster occurred and there was a death on the high

seas at that point.
A

On one of the islands?

Q

No, no, no.

Not an island at all, just collision

or ship or something of this sort.

It had nothing to do with

the Continental Shelf, way outside of the Continental Shelf.
Would yo\i say that Death on the High Seas Act had the
effect of giving cause of action also under Louisiana lav??
A

Wall, nov7, the Death on the High Seas Act, of

course, gives its own cause of action.
Q

I understand that.

A

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act would not

give a cause of action because the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
Act applies only to these islands.
Q

I am talking only about the argument you have beer

making here with respect to the Death on the High Seas Act.
22

A

To the old cases that were in existence?

Q

No, no.

23
Death on the High Seas Act.

You say

24
that Death on the High Seas Act expressly reserves State causes
25
9

1

of action.

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

Now, I am asking you whether that would apply in

4

a situation I put to you, say far beyond the Outer Continental

5

Shelf there was death on the high seas and somebody claims a

6

remedy under Louisiana Lav/ saying that Death on the High Seas

7

Act saves remedies under the State law and this death occurred

8

on direct projected line from the middle of the State of

9

Louisiana»

10
11

12

And, therefore, the contention is that we have a
cause of action under Louisiana law»
A

Oh, 1 don't think in that circumstance, your

13

Honor, that the direct line from the State of Louisiana really

14

has any bearing,

15

direct line from the State of Louisiana has any bearing is

1G

under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act because ——

17

Q

I would think that the only time, in which the

All right.

So it is essential for you to

13

demonstrate not oily that there is a possibility under the Death

19

on the High Seas Act but also that the Outer Continental Shelf

20

Act does provide for the alternative uapplicability of

21

Louisiana law?

22

A

I call it supplementary, your Honor.

23

Q

All right»

24

that right?

25

A

1 donst care what you call it.

Wot necessarily.,
10

Is

?

Q

You have got to show that this , that Louisiana

2

has jurisdiction by reason of the place where this death

3

occurred.

4

A

In the instant cases, your Honor, that point is

5

clearly met because the Outer Continental Shelf Act does

6

specifically say that as to these platforms involved, because

7

they are adjacent to the State, th&t the Louisiana law does

8

apply there now.

9

Q

Yes, but that is only as Federal law?

10

A

As an adopted Federal law, yes, sir,

11

Q

It does not involve Louisiana law?

12

A

Correct, sir.

13

Q

It does not give Louisiana any jurisdiction over

14
15
1G
17
13
19

the Outer Continental Shelf?
A

That is correct.

Jurisdiction, it is Federal

jurisdiction,
Q

Nor does it, as Louisiana law is relevant only

as part of the Federal law?
A

Yes, sir, it is adopted Federal law, Federal

20

jurisdiction.

It is adopted to be applied where not inconsistent

21

with Federal law, but, Mr. Justice Fortas, to get back to your

22

original question, your question could be phrased to be whether

23

the State Death Acts in a situation in which the Outer

24

Continental Shelf is not involved might still be applied

25

according to my argument.

That is the question.

11

1

Q

Correct»

2

A

Now, I point out first that that is not particu­

3

larly at issue here but my question — but the answer is, I

4

think, yes»

5

legislators.

G

They discussed ——

I think that that is the clear intent of the
They discussed that in the legislative history.

7

Q

Wasn’t that of the Death on the High Seas Act?

8

A

No, sir.

9

The Death on the High Seas Act, they

discussed the case of the Hamilton and they noted

that because

«0

hete was a Delaware ship involved, the defendant was a Delaware

11

corporation, and I believe that the plaintiffs were citisens of

12

Delaware, that with those facts, that the Delaware law could

13

apply.

14

Conflicts of Laws Rules of the State of Dela'ware would have to

15

be looked to and if they gave a remedy in those circumstances the

1G
17
10

The law of Delaware would have to be looked to, the

remedy would be available.
Now, it was also pointed, out in that debate that the
State of Massachusetts had different Conflicts of Law Rules and

19

they discussed one of the men from Massachusetts got up and said

20

in such and such a case there w'as a collision, but the ship was

21

22
23
24
25

owned by a Massachusetts corporation but the other ship was not,
was owned by a different State and that the rules were hope­
lessly in conflict and they gave no remedy.
And so, to answer your question il would think that if
a Delaware ship, if the Delaware law had not changed, if a
12

?

Delaware ship with a Delaware corporation with a Delaware

2

plaintiff were involved, yes, Delaware could give its citizens

3

a cause of action under its laws for a Death on the High Seas

4

in addition to or supplementary to what would be available to

5

that person under the Death on the High Seas Act.
Q

6

7

But th&fe would be in a Delaware court, perhaps

in diversity of citizenship, would it not?

3

That would not be as a matter of Federal law?

3

A

That is true.

!0

Q

It would be a matter of additional Delaware law?

11

A

That is right.

12

13
14

what these legislators were discussing when they amended this
provision so that the provision would read, that the Death on
the High Seas Act shall not affect State remedies.

15
13
17
10
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

I think that that is certainly

Q

State remedies.

A.

That is precisely what they had in mind and they

went through that discussion just exactly as I related it to
you.
Now, in the instant cases we really don*t have to
see whether Louisiana in this day and time would apply its
Conflict of Laws Rules so as to in a given situation allow7 a
cause of action, out there, because the Louisiana law as adopted
Federal law is specifically extended to these islands.
But the crucial and important point is that the Death
on the High Seas Act does say in plain terms that it is not an
13

1

exclusive remedy.

2

doesn’t say.

3

Gillespie decisions — the statement of this court was that

4

Congress in enacting the Jones Act intended to make a uniform

5

remedy„

6

That is different than the Jones Act which

The Jones Act — I am certain the Lindgren and

However, the Death on the High Seas Act is different
i

7

from the Jones Act in that the Death on the High Seas Act

8

specifically provides that the remedy is not exclusive.

9
10
11
12

Now, actually
Q

Not exclusive but the legislative history also

shows that the intent was to make a uniform remedy?
A

Uniform basic remedy.

Q

Yes.

they used the word basic in this

The man from Massachusetts says,

”1 want to be sure I get something»"

So, all right you have the

Death on the High Seas Act but the man from Delav/are says, "I
don’t want you taking away what might be available in addition
under my law."
Of course, there is nothing unusual whatsoever in
allowing cumulative remedies for the same wrong.

Suppose that

a man has a chattel or suppose that a man is using someone else8 ti
chattel in damages, why the man who has suffered the damage,

If not, he can collect under tort.

Conflict does not mean

Different.

A

Different. Exactly.

In other words, your Honor,

if conflict meant different — in other words, if the only
Louisiana law that could apply out there was law that was
exactly and precisely the same as the Federal law that was
already in existence out there, what were the legislators doing
in saying that the Louisiana law lias to be applied out there.
They were doing a vain and useless thing.
Q

You would say that in this death case that, if

contributory negligence were proven —-™
A

Yes, sir.

I have lost my cause of action under Louisiana law.

Q

Mr. Henderson, may I ask before you start?

A

Yas, sir.

Q

Do I understand, are you claiming the right of

recovery under both statutes?
A

Of course, I am claiming no double recovery.

I

am saying that I could have a right under either statute just
like a seaman has a right under Seaworthiness and the Jones Act.
Q

In other words, I take it that on the basic

issue of negligence there would have to be a determination of
the issue of negligence under both statutes?
Right?
A

Yes.

Q

And one by the Judge and Admiralty, is that it?

A

It could be, yes.

The Death on the High Seas Act would definitely have
22

to be by the Judge and 2^.dmiralty.
23
Q

And the other would be by a jury?

A

If requested.

24
In other words, if I could bring

25
19

1

myself within the terms of that law.
Q

2

Now, which comes first, are you concluded that

3

if there is a finding against you on negligence say by the judge

4

of the High Seas Act, dees that throw you out of court on the

5

second one, too?

6

A

Yes, it would.

7

Q

Yes.

8

A

In other words, if I can bring myself within the

9

terms of the other I can come and have its benefits.
answer Justice White*s argument •---

17

A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

The Higa case, is that, what you call the Dore

A

No, sir.

The Dore case is one of the cases at

Thera are two cases which have come before this

Q

But there was an earlier decision?

A

Yes, the Higa case I say is in my favor.

Q

Yes,

How do you visualise that case being tried.

Are

there some issues that will be tried before a Judge Admiralty
and other issues before a jury?
A

24

case?

that is true.

No, I think the whole matter could be tried

If the party wants a jury trial under the Louisiana

negligence, why, of course, there is no cause of action under

4

Louisiana law»

And if the jury finds contributory

There would, of course, be special interrogatories

5

6

to the jury, with the plaintiff negligent»

If they answer yes

7

to that, why then the jury case is out.

8

why then it would go on to answer quantum and everything is as

9

ordinary as in a jury trial.

But if they say yes,

But there would be interrogatories to the jury.

10

It

11

would pose no procedural problem.

12

that is done.

13

under both the Death on the High Seas Act and under Japanese

14

law as a matter of fact, as one cited on my brief, District

Court case.

I say in response to Justice White's question that the

16
17

There are cases in which

Jones Act is not in conflict with or inconsistent with unseaworthiness or damages under the Jones Act for unseaworthiness
are not in conflict with or inconsistent with Maintenson Cure (?)
They are overlapping and supplementary remedies, just as my
analogy in a man that might have a remedy for both contract
and tort.
They are not inconsistent.

It is just the rule rather

than the exception to have the possibility of two or three.
Q

Your action in either case would be for

negligence which is your privilege and is different than between

2

the Jones Act and Seaworthiness»

3

situation»

It is a completely different

You have a different cause of action»

4

Here you are claiming that you have to have a cause

5

of action for negligence in Admiralty and you have a cause of

6

action for negligence under the Louisiana law»
Now, would you say that if we decided contrary to

7

8

your view that under the Continental -- within the meaning of

9

the Continental Shelf Act the Louisiana law is in conflict with

10

Federal law, namely the High Seas Act that, you have lost your

11

case?
A

12

No, I wo^lld say that as to the issue at issue

Q

You are just again arguing

that it isn't in conflict»
A

Yes.
Yes, if you would say that the two laws are in

There is no Federal remedy, no yea or nay as to

conflict, yes, your Honor, I have lost»
Q

You have lost your case, in spite of the ressr-

vation of the High Seas Act?

No, I would say that then the case which I

It isn't our practice to have documents like

A

I apologize if I was out of order, your Honor»

I merely meant it as a visual aid as a benefit to the Court»
Q

You did argue the Submerged Lands issue?

A

Yes, your Honor»

Q

Very well, proceed.

A

Thank you, Mr» Chief Justice.

I may point out at this time, sir, that I use the
term Submerged Lands Act because that is the title which the
United States Code annotated has on top of Section 1333 which
I understood it to be the popular name as the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act.
I may be in error on that, Mr. Justice Stewart, and I
wish to state here

though that my argument here is with

reference to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.
Q

When was that enacted?

A

Your Honor, I believe in 1948.

Q

Yes.

And the statute which we know of as the

Submerged Lands Act was enacted in 1953, if 1 am not mistaken.
However, we are talking about the Outer Continental Shelf?
A

That is correct.

One of these Louisiana trained judges, they held that
on deaths occurring on stationary platforms, that

23

25

Death on the

1

High Seas Act is the applicable law, is the Federal dispositive

2

law.

3

cannot apply and is superseded.

That where there is Federal dispositive law the State law

4

And, thirdly, that the State law, the elements of the

5

cause of action provided by the wrongful death action of the

6

State of Louisiana, these elements are inconsistent with the

7

elements of the cause of action provided under the Death on

8

the High Seas Act.
The issue here before us is narrowed down to the

9
10

question as to whether the Death on the High Seas Act which

11

restricts recovery to pecuniary loss can be supplemented by the

12

law of the adjacent State.

13

Before proceeding to give a little more detail ---

14

Q

15

exclusive or not?
A

1Q
17

Isn't there also a question as to whether it is

Yes, your Honor, that is the correlative issue

involved.
1 would like to mention in the Rodrigue case, there

13
19

were two civil actions filed and there was an Admiralty action

20

filed.

21

dismiss by Judge West and those are the only two decisions

22

which are here before the Court today.

23
24
25

The two civil actions were dismissed by a motion to

The Admiralty action was tried on the merits and
judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff on pecuniary
loss and that action is not before the Court here today.
26

1

Wow the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the

2

Boudreaux Rodrigue case as it affirmed the Dora cases.

3

two cases have in common the fact that both occurred on the

4

Outer Continental Shelf more than a marine league from shore

5

and the actions of both against third parties, nonemployers»

6

These

The plaintiff's attorney has attempted to use two

7

avenues by which to incorporate the State law»

3

avenues are the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Death

9

on the High Seas Act»

10

Those two

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides as

11

set forth on page 7 and 8 of our briefs

12

that the laws applicable to these artificial islands are the

13

Federal Constitution and the Federal laxtf»

14

In Division (a)(1)

It then provides that to the extent that the State law

15

is applicable and to the extent that the State law is not in-

1G

consistent, then, these State laws may be applied»

17

And it also provides that the Executive Department

13

of the United States is to define by extending theoretical

19

boundaries into the ocean what adjacent laws are to be applied»

20
21

22
23
24
25

To my knowledge the Executive Department has not
projected these State boundaries out into the ocean and out
into the Gulf of Mexico»
Insofar as the Submerged Lands Act which unquestion­
ably applies here, the Plaintiff's attorney in order to have
the State law adopted as a Federal law, must, meet these three
.27

requirements»

The first requirement is* does the State law

apply.
One of the first things 1 learned in Constitution
law is that where there is Federal legislation in a field that
the Federal legislature is competent to legislate upon? it
supersedes those State laws which have been previously incorpo­
rated by Federal law in order to provide a remedy»
This court in limiting,, in the Lindgren case and also
in the Gillespie versus the United States Steel Corporation
case in which Justice Black was the organ of the Court? there
reiterated the precedent that where the Federal legislature has
pre-empted the field previously occupied by State law and can
competently do so? than the State law is superseded»
Now the Lindgren case is very apropos to this case»
Because in that case a seaman was killed as a result of an
accident which occurred in Virginia waters and he was survived
only by a niece and a nephew who were not dependent upon the
seaman.
The plaintiff’s attorney stated that he had the right
to recover for general damages under the Virginia Wrongful Death
Act as a supplementary law to the Jones Act which is exactly
what is being argued here»
And the Lindgren decision? the United States Supreme
Court held that the Jones Act had been legislated in order to
provide this field of law previously covered by State law»
28

1

And? therefore, that the Jones Act superseded the Wrongful

2

Death Act even to the extent of ruling out general damages«
Thirty-four years later this Court in the Gillespie

3
4

case again affirmed the Lindgren decision,,
But separate and apart from the general field of

5
G
7

Federal pre-emption is the question that there are three de­
cisions by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which are the

8

Loffland Brothers versus Roberts( Ocean Drilling and Exploration

9

Company versus Berry Brothers and Pure Oil Company versus Snipes

10
11
12

13
14
15

cited on page S of our brief in which the Fifth Circuit, has held
and this court has approved since writs of certiorari were
denied in each one of these cases has

held that on the.Outer

Continental Shelf under Section (a) (1) of Title 1333,, it is a
Federal Maritime law that is to apply to personal .injury
litigation and that the State lav; has no application whatsoever.
So that a personal injury litigation, insofar as the

1G

stationary platforms? the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
17
13

as adopting Federal Maritime law governs.
There? this State lav; applied.

19
20
21

The State lav; does not

apply because it has been superseded by the Federal Death on the
High Seas Act.
Even if this court were to hold that State law is to

22
apply.
23

The second requirement written into the Outer Con­
24
tinental Shelf Lands Act is that the State law? before it could
25
29

1

be adopted has to be consistent with Federal laws then existing,.

2

Now? I have set forth in this visual aid as I did in

3

my memorandum* as to a comparison of the various elements of

4

the causes of action provided under Louisiana law and under the

5

Death on the High Seas Act»
The beneficiaries are different.

6
7

8

The damages are

different»
Kow, the Plaintiff's attorney says that there is a

9

hiatus in this particular field of law because no general

10

advantages are provided by the Death on the High Seas Act»

11

submit to you that the Legislature in 1920* that the Legis­

12

lature that enacted the Death on the High Seas Act specifically

13

contemplated the granting of

14

I

general damages.

Judge Putnam, Chief Judge Putnam of New York, author

15

of the bill, provided in his original letter to Congress that

16

the damages were for fair and just compensation.

17

Legislative Judicial Committee modified and qualified that

18

language by saying that it was restricted to pecuniary loss

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

In 1914 the

and this concept of restricting damages to pecuniary loss is
not only applicable in the Death on the High Seas Act but in
the companion case of the Jones Act which was enacted by the
same Legislature in 1920.
I, therefore, submit to you, that the Death on the
High Seas Act does not provide an incomplete remedy for damages,
it provides for the complete remedy as intended by the

30

1
2

Legislatures, so that there is no hiatus»
Therefore,, the two principal requirements cf the

3

Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for the adoption of State

4

law, first its application of State law and secondly the fact

5

that the State law could not be inconsistent, have not bean

Q

complied with in this case, and, therefore, the State law has no

7

application whatsoever»

8

9

Q

What do you do with the savings clause in the

Death of the High Seas Act?

10

A

Yes, your Honor, I am coming to that»

11

That is the second avenue that the Plaintiff6s attorney

12

has sought to use the wrongful death action of Louisiana,

13

Death on the High Seas Act legislative history shows that they

14

intended, at least Judge Putnam did, intended for the Death on

16

Then, Mr. Mann of Illinois, in 1920, made an amendment
because he was concerned with this.
Illinois constituent in Illinois,

He says, "What about an
Does he have to go to

New York to a Federal District Court to assert her remedy?".
He says, "I want to preserve to the State courts their
jurisdiction under their own laws, for my own constituents
to proceed under a State law,"
I think that the legislative history and the arguments
that were presented by the legislature in pages 20 through 23
of our brief, your Honors, show that their intention was not
31

1

to give concurrent jurisdiction, not to give concurrent remedies,

2

but to give alternate remedies.

or the Continental Shelf Act?
A

The Death on the High Seas was in 1920, your

Honor, and the Submerged Lands Act was —*Q

Well, under the High Seas Act and before the

Continental Shelf Act there
law, wasn't there?

was limited applicability of State

With the coming of the Continental Shelf

Act certainly that Act said Federal law should apply on the
High Seas,.or on these islands, artificial islands, right?
A

That is correct,

Q

Mo State law, no State law as State law,

A

That is correct,

Q

Only State law as Federal law,

A

Only State law as adopted by the Federal lav/,

Q

So the State law was put aside and that Act

said that if there is a Federal Act that is in conflict with
State lav/, why it will be the Federal statute that will apply?
A

That is correct,

Q

Are you arguing that the savings clause then in

the High Seas Act is in effect repealed or set aside by the
Continental Shelf Act insofar as these artificial islands are

25
32

1

2

concerned?

That, is the effect of your argument, isn't it?
A

That is correct; that is why I say that you need

3

not decide whether the Death on the High Seas Act is the ex­

4

clusive remedy because the specific legislational point is the

5

Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

6

So that even if the State law could be supplemented,

7

which we deny, but even assuming it could be supplemented under

3

the Death on the High Seas Act, the specific act in question,

3

the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act would not permit it

10

because the State law would inconsistent with the applicable

11

Federal law.

12

Q

Would you mind repeating to me precisely what

13

you believe to be the remedy of people bringing suits like this

14

for death at this place?

15

A

The idea, your Honor, is that the survivors of

13

a decedent have a right to proceed in a. Federal form under

17

Federal lav;.

Now, I believe that is the case on the Outer Continental Shelf.
Q

What about the Louisiana lav; which permits

suits against insurance companies?
A

In a direct action statute?
33

1

Q

Yes.

Welly it is involved in it because some things

we could hold would affect it.
A

That is correct, your Honor. Of course, I believe

that the direct action statute is inimical to maritime law,
inimical to the limitation of liability concept and should not
be applied in maritime cases at all.

And these cases ---

Q

Well, it does, doesn’t it?

A

Your Honor?

Q

It does, doesn’t it in some maritime instances?

It has been applied, your Honor.

What I am

saying here is that it should not be applied.
Q

Well, has it been applied?

A

Yes.

Q

Well, why should that be taken away from them?

What reason is there to take that law away from them?

A person

to have a suit in Louisiana, simply because they live in
Louisiana, why should they not get the advantage of a suit like
that which might permit them to recover something, that without
it they could never recover a penny?
A

What I am saying is, you could not then

incorporate under the Death on the High Seas Act the State law
which you could not do under the adopted provision of the
Outer Continental Shelf.
You cannot, do indirectly what you cannot do directly
because the parent act is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
and you have to look at that primarily.
If you cannot incorporate State law under that Act
you certainly cannot incorporate it under the Death on the High
Seas Act which in itself is incorporated in the Outer

Mr. Mann and Mr. Sanders who were part of the Legislature in

competent, as in the Hamilton.

They could either go into Federal form, with Federal

Q

You mean the same person would have two kinds

of injuries depending on whether he went into the State court
or the Federal court?
A

I am of the opinion that the Death on the High

Seas Act should be given as exclusive remedy, but if we are to
give any effect to Section 7 of the Death on the High Seas Act,
let us apply as Mr. Mann intended to preserve to his con­
stituent, his right to go into a State court with a State
court remedy.
Q

Yes, but Mr. Mann wasn't dealing -- he wasn't
36

also dealing with the Continental Shelf Act»

He was dealing

2

only with Section 1 of the Act he was promoting, and the

laws and Constitutions of the United States shall govern these

artificial islands»

I see what you mean„

Yes.

Q

I understand the opinion of the Court of Appeals

on the analysis that Justice White has just suggested the
Court of Appeals held to answer Mr» Justice Black's question,
the only remedy .is the Federal remedy, the Death on the High
Seas Act»

There is no State remedy under Section 7 or otherwise

of the High Seas Act,

The only remedy is the Federal remedy»

Isn't that what the Court of Appeals held?
A

Yes, your Honor»

Q

I am surprised to hear you suggest that neverthe­

less there may be a State remedy if the proceeding is brought
into a State court»

Hr» Justice Black,

I had understood his question as to the inter­

pretation of Section 7 as to Death on the High Seas Act outside

of the contents of the Outer Continental Shelf and

7

Q

Oh,

A

And that is what 1 was arguing there.

9

Those are

my — my position is that the application of State law in this

10

insofar as

1?

the application of State law is inimical to the Outer Continenta 1

12

Shelf Lands Act and, therefore, could not be applied,

Q

Well, there just isn’t any recovery under State

A

That is correct.

Q

Now that there is a Federal statute, the Death

law,

on the High Seas Act,
A

Yes.

Q

May I direct your attention a bit more specifi­

cally to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Section
1331(a)(2),

Now, merely reading that, I suppose it is at least

arguable that after the enactment of that provision, Federal
law applicable to a tort or committed on one of these artificial
islands on the Outer Continental Shelf, the Federal law would
include not only the Death on the High Seas Act but also such
38

1

legislation in the State of Louisiana relating to this tort

2

as is not inconsistent with the Death on the High Seas Act,

3

Isn't that right?

4

A

That is correct,

5

Q

And so you get down to the question of whether

6

the Louisiana law as in question here* that is to say, Louisiana

7

law providing for recovery in the case of wrongful death, not

8

only for pecuniary loss but also for loss of affection,

9

consortium or whatever it may be, whether those Louisiana laws

10

11

are inconsistent with the Death on the High Seas Act, is that
right?

12

A

Yes, your Honor,

13

Q

And that I take it is the issue before us,

14

because if we find •— if we should conclude that the Louisiana

15

tort law in respect that I stated is not inconsistent with the

16

Death on the High Seas Act, then by virtue of 1331(a)(2),

17

that Louisiana law is incorporated into the Federal law and

18

becomes a Federal law available to these petitioners.

19

Is that right?

20

A

Mr, Justice Fortas, I agree with you in part.

21

But I think that Section (a)(2) has two conditions preceding.

22

One is that there is no Federal dispositive law on the subject

23
24
25

matter, and secondly, that if there is no Federal dispositive
law, the State law may be used provided it is not inconsistent
with other Federal laws.
39

1

Well* that is your argument in this* that is

2

your submission and your adversary says the opposite* 1331(a)(2)

•3

does not specifically refer to those two pre-conditions as you

4

would have us construe them to be?

S

A

Yes,

That is correct* your Honor, and 1 am

6

saying that the Fifth Circuit also held that on the basis of

7

the Berry Brothers and the Pure Oil versus Snipes»

8

That there were two conditions preceding the death»

9

As an alternative argument* your Honors, my principal

10

position is that the State law cannot be applied whatsoever

1?

under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

12

argument* if the Death on the High Seas Act does allow a

13

supplemental remedy* I submit to you that the case cited by

14

opposing counsel* Higa versus Trans-Ocean which he says is in

15

his favor supports our proposition because in Higa the Court

16

held* the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held, as affirmed by

;

Q

But as an alternata

this Court in a writ of certiorari that the State law may be
applied only where its wrongful Death Act provisions give it
extraterritorial effect.
If that is the case* and that is the case we follow
here* I submit to your Honors* that there has been no showing
nor can there be any that the Louisiana Wrongful Death Act
does not have extraterritorial effect.
Opposing counsel has cited E» B» Ward* Jr.
say this to you in connection with that.
40

Let me

1

The E» B* Ward, Jr. does not hold that Louisiana

2

Wrongful Death Act has extraterritorial effect.

3

the time of the Death on the High Seas Act was not in effect,

4

that because of the fact that the ship, the E. B. WARD was a

5

Louisiana ship, it was Louisiana territory so that it could

6

be governed by the laws of the State of Louisiana.

It held at

that the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals be

affirmed because the controlling statute is the Outer

12

That there are patent inconsis­

As to beneficiaries, statute of limitations, contri­

So if we are going to take this cause of action pro­

elements

is inconsistent and contradictory to the elements of the cause
of action provided by the Death on the High Seas Act.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

-™-~•

Mr. Henderson.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP E. HENDERSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. HENDERSON:

Meiy it please the Court, I will take

the discussion of the Higa case first,
In the Higa case, Mr. Higa died on an airplane enroute
41

1

to California to Hawaii»

He died when the plane crashed in

2

the middle of the ocean.

His dependants, survivors filed suit

3

under Death on the High Seas Act and also claimed a civil

4

action as we are here.

5

The Court,, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the

8

Higa case first said, "We are looking to see whether the

7

Conflicts of Laws Rules of Hawaii apply,"

8
9

And it says, they took special note that the airplane
was owned by a California company.

10

Said "No,"

11

They then said, "There is no statute that would apply

12

the Hawaii Death Act to this area and there is no decisional

13

law that would apply under Conflicts of Laws Rules, the Hawaii

14

Death Act to this death.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now, in our case we have both.

We have a statute.

We have the Outer Continental Shelf X^ands Act and we also have
our Death on the High Seas Act,
Snipes in Loffland Brothers cited as Fifth Circuit
holdings did not hold that Federal law is an exclusive remedy.
They only held that State law was not exclusive remedy.
In both of those cases the defendant said, "The
man's action must be dismissed under State law because he was
contributory negligent in one case and the State Statute of
Limitation had run in the other,51
The Court, said, "Mo, that is not true, that the State
42

1

remedy is not his exclusive remedy, he does have a Federal

2,

remedy."
Q

3

What other factors would you suggest, Mr,

4

Henderson, would it take in order to make these two conflicting

5

-- you have quite a number of things here -- statute of

6

limitation, different parties, and theamount and everything

7

else.

0

those conflict at a minimum?

9

Now, what other factors would it take in order to make

A

I think that the word conflict, the approach is

10

wrong in trying to see where they are not identical.

11

think that the word “consistent* meant not identical.

12

nothing could have been extended by that Act.

13

I don't
Otherwise

1 think conflict means opposed to one another.

For

14

instance, if the Federal rule was that the minerals extracted

15

from these artificial islands are the property of the Federal

16

Government and the State law said that the minerals extracted

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

are the property of private citizens, they are in conflict.
So, obviously, the State statute would have to give
way, but as to a tort action or death action, why these are
cumulative supplementary remedies.

Cumulative remedies for the

same incident is the rule rather than the exception in law, as
my example where a man may have a right of contract ©r quasi
contract or tort for the same incident.
They arenot in conflict with one another.
Q

Sir, I know your time is up, but I want to
43

1

follow the Chief Justice0s question to you by this question,

2

A

Yes, sir,

3

Q

Please assume with me for the moment that the

4

Death on the High Seas Act provided a remedy for all of these

5

factorse that is to say* not only for loss,-

6

direct pecuniary loss but also for loss of consortium, love,

7

affection and whatnot, just as the Louisiana law does.

8

Please make that assumption.

But let us suppose that the Louisiana law fixed a

10

higher limit on the aggregate recovery.

Nov?, would you say

1!

that the Louisiana law was still available to you or in those

12

circumstances would you agree that the Federal law and that the

13

Death on the High Seas Act and the Louisiana State law are

U

inconsistent within the meaning of the Continental Shelf Act?

15

1 say that for a man whose chattel is damaged, if he has an
avenue to get recovery under tort that does not mean he cannot

Q

2

Well, let me ask you this.

Suppose the Death

on the High Seas Act said expressly there shall be no recovery

4

for any damages whatsoever of any kind or nature as the result

5

of wrongful death and let us suppose the Louisiana statute did

provide a remedy.

There are many

differences.
Q

A

Beyond the two years.

All right.

Actually, as

a matter of fact the Louisiana Act has a one-year statute but
if we assume that the Louisiana has a three-year statute, then
if the person can bring himself within the terms of the
45

Louisiana Act as adopted Federal law he. can have a recovery„

in other words, if he brings it within three years he can do

Your approach is destroying the Continental

Shelf Act, word by word, line by line conflict?
A

Mo, sir, the only real, the only question is

the word inconsistent.

If inconsistent with means opposed,

why then that is one thing.

If it means not identical, why

then, of course, that is another thing, but I say that the word
inconsistent cannot mean identical or there could be no law
whatsoever extended out there.
Q

Why can't you say that inconsistent means 'this

much — that if you would get different results under the two
regimes there is
A

Because, then the Legislature was

wasting its

breath and ink in extending the law and saying that the
Louisiana law shall be extended out there, because it has got
