ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOMINICK L. MANOLI, ESQ=
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

12

MR» MANOLI;

10

13
14
15
16

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
These cases, No. 573 and 691, are here on writs of
certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the Fourth Circuit.
The Labor Act requires an employer to bargain with a

17

union or a representative which in the words of the statute

18

has been designated or selected by a majority of the employees

19

in an appropriate collective bargaining unit.

20

;

»1

For more than 30 years this Court and the Court of

21

Appeals both under the original Act as well as the present Act

j

22

have enforced Board orders which required an employer to bargain|
j

23

with a union which the employees had designated as their

24

bargaining representative by means of authorization cards and

25

the employer did not have a good faith doubt of the union’s
3

i

!

majority status.

2

The court below which in the past had accepted
\

|

3

authorisation cards as adequate proof of a union's majority

4

status for purpose of a bargaining obligation under Section

5

885 of the statute now holds that these authorisation cards

6

are inherently unreliable and that an employer when he is

7

confronted with a demand for recognition by a union whose

8

representative status is based solely upon these authorisation

9

cards that the employer may assert a good faith doubt of the

10

union’s majority status, refuse to bargain, insist upon an

11

election, and all of this irrespective of the fact that, con­

12

currently with his refusal to bargain, to recognize and

13

bargain with the union as a majority representative concurrently

14

with that action he is engaging in serious unfair labor-

IS

practices which may either belie his reliance upon his good

16

faith doubt or preclude a fair election.

!?

Hence, the central question in these cases, and not

18

only these two cases that are up here from the Court of Appeals,

19

but also the Sinclair case which, from the First Circuit, which

20

will follow these cases, -the central question in these cases

21

is whether the Board may require an employer to bargain with

22

a union whose representative status is based solely upon

23

authorisation cards from a majority of the employees in a

24

particular unit.

25

And th© employer’s concurrent misconduct at the time

4

i

1

that he refuses to bargain with the union on the basis of

2

those cards, the concurrent misconduct, demonstrates that he

3

is refusing to bargain with the union, not because of any

4

assertive doubt of the union's majority status, but in order to

5

gain time, in order to dissipate the union strength and avoid

6

bargaining at all.

7

Q

Is there a question about whether a subsequent

8

election changes any* of this?

9

question?

10

A

Do we have to decide that

The Board's — I think you are getting at what

11

the Board calls a Bernel Foam rule — in other words, if a

12

union comes to an employer,.goes to an employer and demands

13

recognition on the basis of cards and the employer engages in

14

unfair labor practice at that particular time the Board will

15

nevertheless permit the union to go to an electione

13

If the union loses that election because of the unfair

17

labor practice committed by the employer during the pre-election

13

period the Board will permit the union then to go ahead under

19

an unfair labor practice charge and on the basis of the cards

20

demonstrate that it had a majority.

21

22
23

Q

,

Do we have to decide that in this case?

These cases?
A

You don't have to decide that in the Fourth

24

Circuit cases but that issue is present, however, in the

25

Sinclair case, the one from the First Circuit — excuse me for
5

one moment.

i take that back.

In one of the cases here, in one of the cases here
there was an election which the union -■—-

4

Q

So we do have to decide that here?

5

A

That question is here.

6
7

That is right.

And it

is also in the Sinclair case as I recall it.
Now obviously in the time that I have at my disposal

8

I will not be able to go into the details of all these cases

9

here but I think I can fairly say that the factual framework

10

in which this question arises in all three cases is not

n

essentially dissimilar.

12

In each case you have the union which engaged in an

13

organizing campaign among the employees and in the course of

14

that organizing campaign it obtained cards authorizing it,,

15

unqualifiedly.

16

is no ambiguity about these cards here which are reproduced

17

in our brief, which unqualifiedly designated the union as their

18

bargaining representatives.

19

There is no question about the cards.

There

In only one of these cases from the Fourth Circuit

20

and I believe that is also true in the. Sinclair but I don’t

21

want to get into that one, in only one of these cases was

2Z

any question raised as to the validity of the cards in the

23

General Steel case a claim was made that these cards were

24
25

obtained by virtue of misrepresentation as to their purposes.
The Board on the basis of the entire record, upon
6

<*i

the basis of the evidence before it rejected that claim and

2

found that all of these cards here, all of these cards her®

3

unqualifiedly designated the union as a. bargaining repre­

4

sentative and that there was no impropriety in the procurement

5

of these cards.
Now armed with these cards the union went to each

6
1

of the three employers in these particular cases here and asked

8

for recognition.

9

the cards questioned the union’s majority status, refused to

10

bargain with the union and insisted upon an election.

25

Upon what ground did he question him?

A

Oh, I think that it varied from case to case.

on cards, we think they are unreliable because the circum­
stances under which they may have been procured.
In another case an employer said I don't think I
should recognise you because four years ago there was an
election in which this particular union had participated and it
lost.
And still another case an employer said simply no

20
21

Q

In some of them the employers in effect said we don't rely

m
v/

The employer questioning the validity of

comment.

No comment.
:

And still another case the employer when asked to
recognize the union on the basis of the cards said we think
that you ought to go to an election.
And I think there is one case

7

here where the

I

i

employer really never questioned the cards and his answer was

z

no comment»

3

here that the employer actually knew that a majority of the

4

employees had selected that particular union.

5

And there seems to be some evidence in the record

Q

What is the Board's view of what the employer

&

must say, what is the position that he must take before the

7

Board that will recognise that he may insist on an election

3

rather than to a card recognition?
A

9

Your Honor, if a union goes to an employer and

10

says to the employer we have cards here from a majority of

11

your employees which designates us as their bargaining repre­

12

sentative the employer may say ■—■ the Board has said this —

13

the employer may say, ”X don't like cards» I don't wish to

14

rely upon cardi and I do insist that you go to an election»
.

■

15

I think that that is the proper way to resolve this question,

16

this representation question.”

-

'

;

17

If he does know more than that he may even engage

ia

— during the pre-election period — he may engage and make

19

speeches to his employees.

20
21

22

Q

That may not get him ■—■ the union may just file

885 charges on him then?
A

The Board — the general counsel will not issue

23

a complaint in that kind of a situation where the employer

24

says to the union I don't wish to rely upon cards.

25

Q

I don't care how many cards you have got, I
8

t

just don’t like them»

2

A

That is right.

3

Q

That is what the position of the Board is?

A

That is righto

As long as what?

approach to these cards, your Honor»
Q

Quite a bit.

9

?

A

But it has not been a recent change really*

z

your Honor»

I think that this began back some time in the

3

early 60Ss.

At one time the Board would take the position

4

and incidentally i might say that we sold virtually all the

5

cards with this proposition that an employer when a union came

6

to him and said we want to be recognise on the basis of these

7

cards* it was not enough for him to say I don't like the cards.

8

He had to have — or not enough for him to say that I have a

9

good faith doubt in your majority status — he also had to

10

have some objective evidence which supported his good faith

11

doubt»

Today the Board does not insist that when an employer
is confronted for demand -—Q

Where is this articulated in the Board's opinioni

Somewhere* could you --A

1 think you have to take the Aaron Brothers case

which is cited in our brief.

And that one there has made it

18

very clear -- and also you might take a look at page 22 of

19

our brief where we indicated that it is not in every case

20

even where the employer permits some unfair labor practice —

21

excuse me I am getting away from this thing.

22
23
24
25

Even where the employer may commit some unfair labor
practice when he refused to accept the cards.
Q

Well* is the key* Mr. Manoli* that he has no

right or rather the Board will not recognise that he should
10

t

not be concluded by cards, except in situations where there is

z

some kind of unfair labor practice that is connected with

3

his refusal to

4
5
6

A

Yes, that is right, where it is contemporaneous

with refusal to bargain.
Q

1

And even then his right to insist on an election

7

is lost only, if I understood you, if his unfair labor practice?

8

are of a serious nature?

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

And is that, what this case is all about?

n

A

That is what we think is the narrow issue as

12

we see it as presented in this particular case, because I didn't

13

get through with my facts.

14

Q

Mr. Manoli, just so I can be sure that at this

is­

end of the bench I heard you correctly, the cards are obtained

le

by the union?

17

A

Yes.

le

Q

An employer says I won't recognize these cards

18

and he petitions for an election.

No acts of — no unfair

20

labor practices.

21

union submits its cards and the time the election is held?

22

Does the employer have to bargain with the union then?

Now, what happens between the time that the

23

Or does he not?

24

A

No, sir.

25

Q

You are saying he does not have to bargain?

11

t

A

No, sir»

He does not have to bargain»

2

Q

I did .not get that either»

3

A

He can wait for the election and again I want

4

to emphasize,, your Honor, that, of course, this is the case

S

in which there has been no misbehavior»

3

Q

I said that.

7

A

Yes.

8

Q

I didn't understand that from your brief, either.

A

No, there is no obligation of bargaining.

9
m
ii

the law the employer can say X want to go to election.
Q

18
19
20

21

A

Wants an election, that he doesn't wish to rely

Q

Can X ask you just a supplemental question to

on cards.

16
17

He can get it any time he asks for it as long

as he doesn't do any more than say X want an election?

14
15

The

union confronts with the cards and under the Board's view of

12
13

I said that, remember?

that?
Assume an employer hears that an organization campaign
is going on and that employees, some employees are interested
and are signing authorization cards.
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Does the employer have the same right in that

22
context to speak or state his views about the union as he does
23
if an election is ordered?
24
A

Yes, he does.

A
&

1

Q

He has the same right of free speech?

2

A

He has the same right of free speech»

3

Q

4
3

Then he can say just as much but no more than

he can during an election?
A

That

is right.
r

6

Q

That is the

Board's position, too?

7

A

That is the

Board's position.

8

Of course, what is free speech and what isn't free

9

speech you will hear more of that in the Sinclair case.

ia

Q

ii

A

Yes.
But he is and the Board will permit him to

12

speak his peace to the employers who are trying to dissuade

13

them not to vote for the union, not to support for the union,

14

Q

Or not to sign authorization cards?

15'

A

Or not to sign authorization cards, that is right.

16
17
18
19

He can do that.
Q

X don't like to keep repeating myself, but this

X think is quite important, Mr. Manoli, at least to me.
Now I correctly understand the Board8s position to

20

be that the only time that an employer is not bound to a

21

court recognition based upon cards —• in every other situation

22

he is entitled to an election — is that situation in which he

23

24
25

has been guilty of serious unfair labor practice?
A

That is correct.

foot onto that. kind, of a case?

May I just add a very small
It really doesn't »•- but in

13

?

order to be completely accurate,, the Board had a case in

2

which the employer when the union demanded recognition on the

3

basis of the cards, he did not question the cards, he did not

4

raise any question about the union’s majority, but he refused

5

to bargain with the union because you see he thought that

6

he was not subject to the Labor Act,

7

Subsequently as an afterthought you might say he

3

said, "Well, I don’t want to recognize you because I don’t

9

rely on cards,,"

That is really an off-beat kind of a case

10

but in that particular case the Board would not permit the

11

employer, after having refused to bargain with the union on

12

the basis that he did not come under the Act, would not permit
i!

13

him to resurrect or inject into the picture his good faith

14

doubt of the union's majority status.

(
i

But as I say, that is a kind of an off-beat type of

15
15
17

!
a case.
Q

But the employer may say 1 don’t believe in

18

cards and I don’t recognize the union until it is certified

19

and then he may just sit there and then the union will ask

20

for the election?

ai
22
23
24
25

I

A

Right,

Either he or the union under the statute

will ask for the election,
Q

And the unfair labor practices which would

affect this would apparently not be those committed before the
union asking him to recognise, it would be unfair labor

practice afterward?
A

No, there are unfair labor practices that inay

take during the course of the union organizing campaign»
Q

But even if they didn’t, if the first he ever

heard of the campaign was when the union came into him?

6

A

Yes.

Q

And ha said

A

Yes»'

I want an election»

And then if he goes and commits an unfair labor

practice why the same rule applies?

then if the union has a majority of the cards which are other­

wise valid he will be subject to a -—

22

24
25

Q

Is there any magic in what words he says when

he rejects him?
h

No, I don't think so, your Honor.

The Board

has never had a case in which the Board just said well, when
the union asked him to recognise him and say, "Go away/' or
said no more than that, or said, "Go away and I want an
election," usually,

of course there are cases where the

employer says I don't trust cards, I don't thank they are
reliable, I think we ought to go to an election.
But although the Board is not dealt with the first
case I don't think that any meaningful distinctiori can
15

i

1

be drawn between the two.

t
3

0

Well, in these cases here there is nothing on

the language that was used in rejecting the cards?

4

A

Sir?

S

Q

There is nothing significant about the language

6

in these cases that was used in rejecting the cards?

7

Is that right?

8

A

9

10

Well, I think you would find without spelling

out which particular case in which the employer did say we
don’t want to rely upon cards, we want to go to an election.

11

Q

12

A

That is right.
And another — I think there were two of those

13

cases ~~ there was another case here where the union actually

14

put the authorization cards in front of the employer and the

15

employer took a glance at them and said, "I don’t want to go

16

on the basis of the cards. I want to go on an election."
So as I say I wouldn’t draw any narrow distinction

17
18

as to whether the employer would be articulate enough to

19

say "Well, look I have heard all of these stories about cards

20

not being very reliable.”
But if he simply says, "I want to go to an election,"

21
22

I think that is the way the union should establish its

23

majority status is by election, then I think the Board will

24

permit it.

25

The Board will permit him to refuse to bargain

with that union to recognize him.
16

1

2

Q

Or even if he said, "Don't waste my time, go

to an election?"

3

A

Yes, I think so.

4

Well, I think we have pretty much gotten the facts

3

of these cases out so I won't spend any more time with that

6

and I have already indicated what the Fourth Circuit's opinion

7

is as to the unreliability of the cards.

8
9

10

Now, 1 wanted to go into the two arguments that I
think ought to be brought out in connection with these cards.
Our analysis, of course, begins with Section 8(a)(5)

11

of the Act.

12

for an employer to refuse to bargain with a representative

‘13
14

15
16
17
18
19

20
2!

22
23
24

Section 885 makes it an unfair labor practice

of his employees as defined in Sections 9(a) of the Act.
Section 9(a) of the act in turn defines a repre­
sentative as one which has been designated or selected by a
majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit.
Section 9(a) does not specify how the employees will
designate or select their employees and both under the
original Wagner Act as well as the present act the Courts
of Appeals have consistently recognized that a union could
establish its majority status not only by means of an election
but also by other means including authorization cards.
And this Court, in the Arkansas Oak Flooring case
which was decided

some nine years after the Taft-Hartley

Amendments of 1947 and I will come to those amendments in just
25

17

1

a moment, the court in that particular case said that a union

may establish its election but that an election was not the '

cards.

of the Courts of Appeals and practically all of the Courts of

By at least one union.

A

Right.

Q

And prior to 1947 was there explicit statutory

provision for Board-supervised elections at the request of a
union?
19

A

1

Under the Wagner Act there was a provision

2

in Section 9 there which empowered the Board to ascertain

3

whenever a question concerning a representation arose to

4

determine that question either by means of an election or

5

if I can remember the exact language of the Wagner Act or by

6
7

other suitable means for ascertaining the employees and the
47th Amendment knocked that part of it out.
By other suitable means and the 47th Amendment made

a

a Board election the sole basis of formal Board certification,

from the Board certification which issues follows.

13

Were there ]

many elections?
A

14
15

What was the practice prior to 1947?

Yes, there were.

There were elections.

X

thought your Honor was going to ask me if the Board certify
a union since all the suitable methods were also available to
it that it often certified a union on the basis of something
other than an election.

19

Q

Well, you framed my question better.

A

The Board did that until 1939, it would certify

20

a union on the basis of cards or some other basis, usually
21
22

cards, or some other written proof of the union’s majority
status.

23

In 1939 the Board abandoned that practice.

But the

24
Board, however, continued to serve by a union on the basis of
23
20

1

cards where the employer and the union both agreed to have a

2

cross-check of the cards against the payroll in order to

3

determine the authenticity of the cards and in that particular

4

situation the Board continued after IS39 — not many of those

S

I would suspect — 1 really don’t know how many * probably not

6

many but nonetheless the Board would continue to issue certi­

7

fications on the basis of that kind of a cross-check where

8

both parties agreed the cross-check was correct a certification I

9

was issued»

10

11

amendments, the 47 amendments do longer permit the Board certi­

12

fication to issue on anything but an election.

m

Q

Mr. Manoli, let me just ask you one final

question on that.
Assume the union representatives come to an employer

16

and present some cards to him and say here we have a majority

17

and the employer looks at him and says well, it certainly

18

appears you have a majority and I have no question about the

19

cards and it looks to me like you have a majority of the

20

workers with you.

21

But I want an election.

22

A

23
24
25

The Board will permit him to go to an election

as long as he does not misbehave.
Q

The test you state in your brief is whether or

not the employer has a good faith doubt about the majority
21

j

!

status of the union and that unfair labor practice is only a

2

material element in judging whether or not he had a good faith

3

doubt.
Now you are stating a considerably different rule

now.

It is the Board rule in Aaron Brothers.
Q

But the employer says I have no doubt at all

about your majority status.

I have no good faith doubt.

But

I just want an election.
A

Let me put two different type cases in order to

answer your Honor.
Q

How about that one* just that one?

The employer

does no more than that and he says I have no good faith doubt
that you have a majority there but I am not going to recognize
you without an election.

A

I want an election.

Is he saying — if I can put the question in

return — is he saying* I have no doubt* I have no doubt that
you have cards here signed by a majority?
Q

He says I have no good faith doubt.

A

I have no good faith doubt that these cards

have been signed by a majority of my employees but I still
don't like cards and I want to go to an election.
Q

;

He doesn't say I don't like cards.

He says I

been guilty of 8(a)(5) violation?
A

That is correct,

Q

That seems to me a considerably different thing

than you have in the brief but you want, us to accept it, though?
A

Let me put this case ——

Q

Right?

A

Yes, that is right.

You want us to accept the statement?

Let me put this case — suppose that the employer
when faced with these cards he would say, I have made my own
independent check of the employees and I have discovered from
my own independent check of the employees and independently
of your cards that they do want you as their bargaining
representative.
Now in that case there he will be required to bargain
with the union even though he may not engage with any unfair
labor practice,

I want to make that clear.

Even the Fourth Circuit in that kind of a case would
23
enforce a bargaining order where the employer has made his own
24
independent poll of the employees and on the basis of that the
25
23

1

employees have told him, "Yes, we want this union,” the

2

majority of them.
Q

3
4

Then even the Fourth Circuit —-

You mean if he has a mass meeting of the

employees and said, 51Do you fellows want this union?”

5

And unanimously they say, "We sure do.”

0

Then he has to recognise?

7

A

That is right.

8

Q

Well, you draw the line then between him saying

19
20

21

22
23
24
25

that I have no good faith doubt that these are the signatures
and him saying that I have no doubt that you do represent a
majority.

You draw a line between those two?
A

If he says yes, I think you would draw a line

between those two.
Q

If he says I have no doubt that these are the

signatures of 51 percent of my employees and I have no doubt
that 51 percent of the employees wants you but I still want
an election?
A

Put that way he cannot insist upon an election.

Q

You say he can or cannot?

A

He cannot, insist upon an election.

Because there he is not merely saying in the case
Mr. Justice Marshall has put to us he is not merely saying I
know you have got cards here but he is also saying that he
knows, he knows independently of the cards that a majority
of the employees have designated that view.
24

}

I
2

Q

But his only evidence of whether he knows or not

is the cards?

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

He can have the election?

3

A

Yes, that is right*

6

Now, to go on with the legislative history, as I

■

7

have indicated the courts that uniformly interpret both the

8

Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act to permit the use of

9

cards for a union to demonstrate its majority, its majority

status, 47 amendments did not change either Section 8(a)(5)
which was 8(5) in the original Wagner Act or Section 9(a),
In fact the legislative history of the 1947 amendment
shows that the Conference Committee specifically rejected the
House-passed amendment which would have relieved the employer
of any obligation to bargain with a union which based its
majority status on cards.
Congress specifically rejected that proposal which
would have amended Section 3(a)(5) so as to permit the Board
to issue a bargaining order only where the employer was either
refusing to bargain with a union that he was currently recog­
nizing or a union which had been certified by the Board after
an election.
Congress, as I say, rejected that amendment, and
retained the language of Section 8(a)(5) and Section 9(a) which
from the very beginning of this statute had been covered both
25

1

by the Board and by the Courts as permitting the use of cards

2

to establish a union majority status»

3

The 1959 amendment when there was discussion, when

4

there was the legislative consideration of the 1359 amendments,

S

Congress again took note of the fact that the bargaining

6

obligation, Section 8(a)(5), that the issuance of a Board

7

bargaining order was not dependent upon a Board election»

8

9

It took, specific note of Board cases where the Board
had required an employer to bargain with a union whose repre­

10

sentative status was based on cards and where the employer had

1?

engaged in misconduct which belies good faith doubt,

12

Nonetheless, the 1959 Congress did not amend the

13

basic language of Section 8(a)(5) or Section 9 which as X

14

repeatedly ha\re said is the beisis for the use of cards as a

IS

means for establishing a majority position of the union.

IS

Now it is argued very strongly that cards because of

17

the circumstances that may attend their procurement are

18

inherently unreliable and an election is the only proper way

19

of safeguarding the employers and permitting them to

20

vote their convictions,

SI

ji

X would think that the fact, that the Congress must

22

have discounted this argument when in 1947 it rejected the

23

House-passed amendment which had relieved the employer of any

24

obligation to bargain with the union whose representative

25

status was based on cards.

puts that burden upon the general counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT GORE, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
FOOD STORE EMPLOYEES UNION, LOCAL 347
12

MR. GORE;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.

IS

20
21

22
23
24
25

this court to argue a case in conjunction with the Board with
some slight differences and now in the position of having to
take the position almost diametrical to that which has been
argued today.
The statement of Board counsel in respect to the
responses of respective questions of your Honora do not, in
my view, suggest the rule that the Board is now following,
nor do they suggest the rule that the law lays down.
The inherent interpretation that can be predicated
upon counsel8s responses to the questions is that cards are
28

1

unreliable because he argues as we do that there are two ways

2

to gain recognition, there are two ways to impose a duty to

3

recognize upon an employer, i.eM the route by way of the

4

election and second, the route by way of authorization cards,

5

Unambiguous, unequivocal signed by a majority of the

6

employees, without restraint or coercion, it was this rule that

7

was approved by Congress in 1947, it was this rule which has

3

been approved by Congress in 1959, it is this rule which

9

certain members of Congress have attempted to change un-

10

successfully.
{

n

The rule as we see it is that when as in Gissel

12

Packing the case in which we are the Petitioner, a majority

13

of the employees signed clear and unambiguous cards saying

14

I authorise this union to represent me for wages, hours and

IS

conditions of employment.
And when this majority of cards are tendered to the

13
17

employer in one form or another and in the instant case they

18

were tendered to the employer himself, not to a third party

19

and they say here are the cards, we represent a majority.
At that point as we view the law, the employer is

20

21

under a duty to recognize.

Oh? yes.

Why would he get it?

If the employer files a petition because the

18

one amendment in 1947 that has some relevance to this case was

19

the amendment in Section 9(c) (1) (b) ? and the way this came; up

20

was that Congress was concerned with the fact that a union

and at that point the union can say,

"Yes, we agree,” and

Whereas, the employer sits on his hands and says,

17

are going to disagree with, we are going to raise an objection

Q

Mr. Gore, the difference between your position

and that of Mr. Manoli is that Mr. Manoli -- you say that

after the union presents the authorization cards to the

employer, the employer is under a duty to bargain with the

S

union unless and until the employer files a claim for e, hearing.;

Mr. Manoli says that when the union presents

10

the authorization cards to the employer, if the employer Says

n

I don*fe believe in cards, and I refuse to accept these cards

12
13

,

and does not engage in unfair labor practice, then the employer
is not, is not under an obligation to bargain with the union.

14

A

Yes.

15

Then there has to be an election presumably

on the petition of the union?

That is his position, yes.

Unquestionably Mr. Manoli is in a better position to

Q

How about yesterday?

A

Yes, yesterday's position I thought I understood.

Q

Are there any eases that you know of which

articulates the view that Mr. Manoli has?
A

Well, the Aaron Brothers case that Mr. Manoli

suggested articulates a view that an employer may refuse to

recognize under certain circumstances when there are no unfair
labor practices.
It also articulates the view that the employer has

Gissel Packing Case.

The Board accentuated the fact and relied in great
measure upon the fact that the employer did not file a
petition under Section 9(c)(1)(b).
41

X should, however, add

i

that this case presents in addition numerous unfair labor

2

practices engaged in by the employer, including discharges

3

which were obviously inconsistent with a desire to give the

4

employees a free choice.

I think it is crucial to find that when the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E, JENKINS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
GISSEL PACKING COMPANY, INC. ET. AL.

13
MR. JENKINS;

If it please the Court.

16
Perhaps it would be helpful to the court having heardJ

17
this general discussion of the principles involved in the issues;
18
in this case if we take Gissel as an example from a factual
19

standpoint and see how the application of these principles came

20
up with one little sausage maker back in hills of West Virginia.

21
Back in the early 1960 es, about '61, this union.

22
started a massive organization campaign in the retail food
23
24
25

industry there and it attempted to organize the Logan Packing
...

Company, the Gissel Packing Company and many other companies.

44

1

Petitions .-were filed, cards were taken up and the

2

union claimed it had a majority of the employees and in 196.1

3

the National Labor Relations Board came in and pitched its

4

tents on 1 these company premises and ordered the employees to

5

vote without the president of the company hanging over their

6

shoulder or without the union organiser hanging over their

7

shoulder in a free expression of their wishes.

On whose petition was that?

And when this occurred and the union having

12

represented as it must of necessity that it had a majority

13

because it had demanded recognition before that in these cases,

the employees in all of these companies rejected the union.
Three or four years passed, and the union was still

under great pressure from its main clients, A£P, Kroger and

17

the big chains to organise this industry.
This was no spontaneous rising of union interest of

18
19

the employees in this company.

They started in with the new

20

technique which the Board had developed for them that is on

21

trial before this court today, the authorization card technique
And in January of 1965, they contacted Gissel, my

Bargain with us or we will file unfair labor practices against
you.

We got some cards.

Q

No, I say, why would you now in response to my

question whether your rights could be protected in that manner?
Why would you fight for the other position if it made no
difference?
A

Well, it seems to me that an employer's rights

13

14

in this situation should not be dependent upon his filing a
paper.

Either he has an obligation under the .Law to recognise

15

this union or he doesn't.

this matter are dependent upon whether he files a paper or

who files a paper.

That is what happened here.

There were no

Well, of course, there is a six-month's statute

of limitations on that.
A

That is right.

The Aiello doctrine which

formerly existed up until 1964 for a period of ten years, under
that doctrine the union, if it knew about unfair labor
practices had to make up its mind whether or not those practices
72

1

were sufficient to interfere with an election»

not allowed to go through a futile election knowing about

unfair labor practice charges.

The union x-i&s

Does it have to be an 8(a)(5)?
A

No, sir»

Q

Just any kind?

A

Any kind

of an unfairlaborpractice

brought by the union against theemployerpending

charge

theelection

will result in the elections being held up unless the union
also files a waiver saying ws won't use these charges to set
aside the election.
Q

We would like to go on and hold it.

Let us assume they resolve the unfair labor

practice against the employer and then will they order him to
bargain automatically no matter

what kind of an unfair labor

practice charge it was or does it depend on whether the unfair
labor practice charge might have tainted the election?
A

If the election is held and the union loses,

the election must be set aside before the Board will entertain
an 8(5) charge.

23
Q

Suppose there is apetition for an election»

24
The union files an unfair labor practice charge.
25
73

Accept the

t

hypothesis that the charge does not necessarily bear upon the

z

fairness of the election.

3

Board hears the charge holding any action on the election.

Suppose it is found that the charge is sustained but that it

is not conduct on the part of the employer that will interfere

with the conduct of a fair election.

As i understand the practice, the

What does the board do then?

11

dissipate the effect of these unfair labor practices, it goes
ahead and holds an election and that is what I am saying the
Board ought to do in almost all of these cases.
Q

12
13

16
17
18
19

You have competing unions in a plant and the employer
commits an unfair labor practice by let us say demoting one
of those opponents of

22
23
24

one of the unions.

But the union that

gets the card is the other union and it is the one that
then seeks recognition and the employer says no, I will have
an election.

And he does.

Then there is an unfair labor practice charge in

20
21

I am just thinking of a situation that could

happen some time.

14
15

It goes ahead after there has been a chanc© to

connection with the demotion of the employee active for the
union that lost out with the employee.

You mean if they find

in that situation that the unfair labor practice charge is
sustained there will not ba an election involving the other
union?

The election will only be thrown out where it

it is any ofchesr sort of charge, if it is an 8(15, 8(3) charge

to bargain?

12

I think the Board’s remedies are ample to control

13

these situations.

The Board has the contempt power of the

court at its disposal.

15

It has a 1Q-J injunction built into

the Act, at its disposal.

It need not destroy the employee’s right to an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK F» HOLROYD, ESQ,
22
ON BEHALF OF HECK’S, INC»
23

MR. HOLROYDs

Thank you, sir.

Gentlemen,

24

You have heard all of the confusion here about the
25

75
l

If

t

state -df the law»

In the minds of the experts here I think

2

there is little wonder that my client when approached by a

3

union in light of all this will say I have no comment,

4

And this is what he said.

5

Q

What did he say, I have no what?

8

A

No comment.

7

The union presents to a company and I think we have

8

to be realistic about this, gentlemen.

We can get up on the

9

level that we like to speak and say that this is the way the

10

law is and this is the way it ought to be but I think we have

11

got to get down and put ourselves on the level of the employer

12

standing there when the union official comes out of the blue

13
14
15
16
17
18

and presents cards to him as to what should he do and what can
he do.
And I think we also have to put a more — more
importantly I think we have to put ourselves in the position
of fcte employee when a union official comes to his home and says

I would like for you to sign a union card.
The employee says, for example, "Well, what is this
all about?"
The union official says,

"Well, we are trying to get

in over the company."
Well, the employee says, "Has everybody else signed?"
"Yeah, most everybody else has signed."
So he signs his name.

25

Or a friend next door comes

over and says, Jim, how about signing this for te.

signs his name.

many instances not understanding at all what it is that he is

doing, the Board through, its rules have limited the evidence

which can be presented in the appellate . court in this regard

news to me.

rejected the petition based on the unfair

the union had a majority.

You have got to remember, gentlemen, in this one
case, in the''Heck's case, in the warehouse case, the union
79

1

came to the company, they had 13 cards and there were 26

2

employees in the bargaining unit said we represent a majority.,

3

They did not represent a majority and the Board so held.

4

Now the next day they came up and got another card

£

and then sent a letter to the union without relating the fact

6

that they had secured additional cards, sent a letter to the

7

union or to the company said, confirming our conversation of

8

yesterday or last week we demand

9

rights„

recognition and bargaining

Well nothing has come to the mind of the company

10

11

which would indicate that the union had later secured its

12

bargaining rights.
Now, one more point that I think is very significant,

13

U
15

gentlemen.
And that is this matter of good faith,

The mere

16

fact that a company commits unfair labor practice before,

17

during or after a demand for recognition in my judgment has

18

absolutely nothing to do with his state of mind in declining

1©

to recognize a union on his doubt that the union represents

20

a majority.

21

22
23
24
25

The union says and the Board says that if unfair
labor practices occur after the demand he could not have had
good faith when he denied it.
This doesn't make sense.

Now if you want to punish

the company for this, then this is all right.
80

This is a

punishment„

But if you want to say that because he committed

How about if he immediately fires or discharges

all of those who were active in the union?
A

He could still have a good faith doubt that the

union represents a majority and fire their.,, yes,, sir.
Q

In this case the day after the company was

notified they fired the principal union worker,, didn't they?
K

They fired a man that the company was under the

impression he was a supervisor.

It turned out that the Board

held he was not,
Q

They also told other employees, did they not,

that they would lose their bonuses and various other things if
they persisted and they did take away at least one signature
didn't they?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Now you don't think those things bear on whether

it is good faith or not?
A

This is a good, point, your Honor, because ------

Q

I thought so,

A

Well, when the union in this case made its

oral demand for recognition it did not present a majority and
23
the Board so held.

So the good faith is bound to have been

24

there because the fact was there.
25

81

And nothing came to the

1

company as I say which would indicata that the union later

2

mustered up another card to get it that one over one-half»
But now, if you want to punish the company because

3
4

of their subsequent unfair labor practice by throwing this

5

plumb to the union, that is the employees and these are whose

6

rights the National Labor Relations Board is supposed to be

7

protecting, if you want to throw this plumb to the union as

8

a punishment to the company, then, of course, this is one thing»
But merely to say that their subsequent unfair labor

9
10

11

practices negate the possibility of good faith in the first
instance to me is not sound reasoning at all,
Q

12
13

this may depend in part on which proposition, you stack with»
On the one hand it is possible to look at this problem

14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

Well, I suppose that the way you come out on

on the assumption that the cards are valid and that they are
operative and effective to require the employer to recognise
the union unless the employer in good faith soubts that they are
authentic«
Now that seems to be the position of the Board» In
other words, they start with the proposition that the cards,
authorization cards, are valid and effective unless there is
some reason to challenge them»
The other way to look at it has been expressed on
the other side is that the cards, you start with the proposition

24

that cards are not affective and that it is only if the
25

82

1

employer does something that may make an election, the holding

2

of a fair election in fact impossible.

3

only if the employer does something to make the election

4

impossible will the cards then be given some vitality and life.

That the employer,

*

But as I understand it, the Board9s position as

3
3

expressed Mr. Manoli here is that the cards are effective to

7

require their acceptance and recognition by the employer

8

unless he in good faith doubts, unless he has some basis for

8

doubting in good faith their validity.
And it is not just the effect of the unfair labor

10
11

practice on the possibility of holding a fair election.
A

12

13
14

time is up, that cards are valid for the purpose of nomination
but they are not valid for the purpose of election.

Q

You would say that it is, that it would be

11

the rare unfair labor practice that wouldn't vitiate the

12

possibility of a fair election?

13

A

That is quite right.

As a matter of fact in

14

our brief we suggest to the court that there are many alctivi-

IS

ties engaged in by employers that are.not unfair labor practices

16

that still affect and vitiate a free election.

!

17

Unfortunately the law cannot be written which will

18

be able to take care of all of these things because of the

position of the employee vis a vis the employer* the life and

20

briefly to the comments of Mr. Jenkins.

There was some argument

17

as regards the record with respect to certain other cases

18

with respect to what happens to petitions.

19

I would like to read to the court from a decision

20

of the Fourth Circuit in the Sehon Stevenson case which was

21

called to your attention and it relates to the petition.

22

It says as follows;

23

You may have three minutes

Your time was taken up by questions.
MR. GORE;

The employer9s petition for an election

1

was denied because of the pendency of the unfair labor practice

z

charges,

3

of violation of Section 8(a)(1), (3) and (5)..

4

A hearing held on those charges resulted in findings

This is indeed what the fact is.

The Board will set

5

aside a petition be it a union petition or an employer petition

8

if the charges are valid.

7

are not valid, the charges are dismissed and the Board goes

8

forward with'the election.

On the other hand* if the charges

It is simple as that.
Q

So the petition is really held in suspense, are

you saying?
A

As a matter of fact, the petition under Board

rule is in some 90 to 95 percent of the cases held in suspension
There are a few unusual cases.

Pandit Terminals is one,

Marston Corporation is another where the Board has gone forward
in spite of the existence of unfair labor practices.
Q

And have the election anyway?

A

Yes.

Q

And this is without first deciding the unfair

labor practice?
A

They have gone forward, to make it clear, they

have gone forward with the processing of the representation
case, which they normally hold up and I do not recall the case

23
where they actually held the election.

I think they wait

24
until the charges are resolved one way or the other before
25
87

I

the election is held»

2

But let me point out„ in 90 to 95 percent of the

3

cases the processing of the petitions is held up pending the

4

processing of the charges.
Now., I think that we ought to note that in Gissel

5

6

Packing andll think in Heck’s — I know less about General

7

Steel Products —■ the cases involve serious unfair labor

8

practices, engaged in simultaneously, the request to bargain

9

and the tender of cards.
In Gissel Packing several months before the union

10
11

tendered the cards but when the company knew the union was on

12

the scene the company threatened the employees with discharge

13

if it found they had talked to the union agents.
This threat of discharge continued from before the

14
15

organizational activity began andcontinued from its inception

16

to beyond the point when the demadd was made.
There was a crescendo which followed the demand of

17

18
1©

20
21
22
23
24
25

the union,
I would like to end by saying one thing,.

It is clear

that the purpose of the law cannot be to restore the wrong
doing to as good a position as he would have occupied before
he engaged in such serious violations.

(Whereupon, at 1:55 p„m. the oral argument in the
