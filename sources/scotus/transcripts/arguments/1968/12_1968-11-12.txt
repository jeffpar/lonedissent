ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM GLASSER, ESQ.

1)

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

I

MR. GLASSER:

Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justice:

v

the certiorari here is to review a judgment of the Second

n

Circuit which confirmed a narcotic conviction, a rather notable

u

narcotic conviction, as I think Your Honors know.

u i

It involved the largest shipment of pure heroin ever
captured in this country, familiarly known as the French deep
freeze case.

The narcotic was brought over and secreted in

a hollowed-out deep freeze structure.
Our petitioners all have very heavy jail sentences.
The shortest sentence is 10 years, and that is Sutera.

Dioguardi

has 15 years, Desist has 18 years, and the two French defen­
dants have 20 years with a $5,000 fine.
I am purposely emphasizing these sentences at the
outset, and another factor which I will mention in a moment,
for reasons I will mention momentarily.
2

1

These men have now served

Nebbia and LeFranc have

2

been sitting in jail since about the end of December of 1965,

3

the year that this situation was broken open, so they are in

4

now nearly three years, and the others — that is, Dioguardi,

5

Sutera and Desist — were out on bail for a while, and then

6

they have been in for a little over two years.

7

The Government has the heroin.

This heroin was

S

not marketed.

9

ment now has been paid out by these men a certain amount of

10

The Government has the batch, and the Govern­

jail service.
I am mentioning that because we all know that in the

1!
12

briefing over the question of retroactivity of Katz in this

13

case, the Government has expressed concern that there would be

14

something alarming to the sense of law enforcement in giving

15

this type of defendant the benefit of a case like the Katz

16

case on retroactivity.

17

So

I am saying that it isn't altogether a dead loss

18

in realistic, down-to-earth, day-to-day law enforcement policy

19

terms.

20

served a good bit of jail time.

The Government has the heroin, and the men have already

21

Q

Was none of this stuff marketed at all?

22

A

No.

In fact, Your Honor, the deep freeze —

23

this is according to the Government theory of the case — was

24

received in the hands of a fellow named Conder, an Army Warrant

25

Officer in Georgia.

He, according to Government theory, was
3

I

told one night to unpack it, and he had it unpacked, and in

2

suitcases, and felt very gingerly about it and wanted to be

3

rid of it and he was rid of it because the police came and got

4

it.
None of the defendants who are the petitioners here

5
6

are shown to have had any contact with this heroin.

Conder,

7

of course, says that Desist supplied him with the deep freeze

S

and then hollowed it out.

9

hollowed out the deep freeze, but except for that contact of

It isn’t even definite that Desist

10

Desist with the alleged preparation of the structure, this

11

isn’t even a possession case, incidentally.

2

matters at this stage, but it may be of interest.
Q

13
14

It is not that thai

When you say none of these petitioners had any

contact with this heroin, I suppose you mean physical contact.

m

A

Physical contact?

16

Q

And you don't mean contact in arranging for it

17

or anything of that kind.
A

18

22

25

rupt.

I go further, although I didn't wish to inter­

I would go further, and this is all under the proofs.

We are talking about what the proofs show.
The proofs show not only no contact, but the proofs
don't even tie in these people with the heroin except circum­
stantial evidence, that Conder said that Desist gave him money
to bring the deep freeze over, and Conder claiming he didn’t
know it was heroin, so there is no proof or no tie-in there.
4

1

2

Q

Now you are arguing to us a sufficiency of the

A

Not really»

evidence.

3

I am arguing the atmosphere of the

4

case in case you leave these fellows go, that you shouldn't

5

ieel too badly about it if you apply Katz»
Q

6

Wall, $9 million worth of heroin is quite a

7

■isable project, as you might realize.

8

/ou was this;

9

with the heroin.

But what I was asking

You said that these defendants had no contact
j
You meant by that, I assume, the physical

!0

contact and you did not mean that this was a Louisville versus

tl

Kentucky case, and there was no evidence in the case?
A

12

This is not a Louisville versus Kentucky case.

13

If it had been that, you would have had a brief from me on

14

it, because I think I briefed nearly everything else in this

IS

case.
Shall I continue?

16

Q

17

$9 million.

As a matter of interest, the Chief Justice said
I read somewhere that the value of this was $100

million.
A

That figure I have read also.

That depends on

how they cut it up, and so on.
If I may continue, there are, of course, the other
aspects of this case.

We all had the impression about the

aspect which caused the grant of certiorari, and that was the
electronic monitoring.
5

1

We all have the impression that by far the forefront

2

issue in this case is the electronic issue, and the issue of

3

retroactivity of Katz.

4

Now I would like to say something that I hope won’t

5

startle anyone.

6

it, which was, frankly, just a few days ago, after I read the

7

Court’s Fuller versus Alaska decision, and felt dismay at the

S

sudden sinking of our chances in our case, but the dismay, as

9

sometimes happens, provoked me to re-think the whole situation

to

n

It startled me a little when I finally realizec

very hard.
I suddenly saw this, and I would like to convey this

12

to the Court;

We don’t need in this case a ruling that Katz

13

is retroactive.

14

to it on correct law — what we need is a ruling that Katz

15

declared pre-existing law.

All we need — and I believe we are entitled

Katz didn't make new law.

16

I have read Katz again very carefully the last few

17

days, and, in fact, I put in another brief last Friday which

18

is called the Joint Supplemental Reply Brief, which I trust

19

Your Honors have received.

20

That brief is largely devoted to arguing that Katz

2!

did not make new law, but that Katz merely gave expression to

22

pre-existing Fourth Amendment lav;.

23

rect, this analysis I have just offered -- if that is correct,

24

there is no retroactivity problem here at all.

25

If that analysis is cor­

It becomes

Tike the situation in Stovall where rir. Justice Fortas in his
6

*£

separate opinion in Stovall noted that he would not reach the

2

retroactivity issue., but he would treat the issue as one of

3

due process.

4
5

It was pre-existing due process.

We are not making new law that requires a decision
on retroactivity.

We are applying the law as it existed,

I would invite Your Honors to focus especially on a

6
7

re-reading of Katz whan you undertake your own deliberation in

S

this case.

9

that it is not a retroactivity decision at all.

10

Read Katz closely to see whether I am not right;

Q

I suppose the position that you are urging would

II

be that Katz was always the law and was consistent with the

12

decisions of this Court.

13

A

I see Your Honor is smiling, and I am not smilinc

14

in mutuality, because I have a very pleasant thing to say.

15

have excellent authority, I almost said for the notion,

16

n-o-t-i-o-n -- for the position that Katz was always the lav/.

17

I

Mr. Chief Justice, in the Butanka argument, as re­

18

ported in the Criminal Lav; Reporter a few weeks ago, the

19

Solicitor General said something about what the men in Katz

20

did, the agents did, that it was legal at the time that they

21

did it, and Your Honors said if that were so, wouldn’t we have

22

abided by the precedent?

23
24
25

Anyway, Your Honor was apparently suggesting to the
Solicitor General there that what Katz says is wheit the law
always was.
7

1«

Now, there are other reasons why we don’t believe or

2

we do not stand or fall — our fate does not depend upon the

3

question of retroactivity or prospectivity of Katz.

4

a whole other half of this case.

5

There is

We contend that what the Government did, or what the ]

6

narcotics agents did — by the way, it was done at the Waldorf-

7

Astoria Hotel.

8

agents installed an electronic type of listening device in a

9

room adjoining a room occupied by petitioner Nebbia.

At that hotel in December of 1965, narcotics

Then over

10

the next couple of days, the agents heard various things which

11

were testified to at the trial, and which, if believed, were

12

damaging.
Now the agents say that they put their bug in their

13
14

own room rather than in Nebbia's room, and they didn't pene­

15

trate Nebbia's enclosure in any way; that they laid the micro­

16

phone or listening device at the bottom of the door of their

17

own room where there was a small aperture, and beyond that door

18

v/as an air space of a few inches, and then a door to Nebbia1 s

19

room.

20

It was a typical double-door arrangement.

21

it was completely non-trespassory, a non-physically intrusive

22

type of monitoring.

23

They said

This is only the second time I have ever argued before

24

this Court, and the last time was more than 20 years ago.

One of those shows a

What it was draped over, as the

7

Q

Were these exhibits in court?

S

A

Yes.

9
10

I have something else that wasn't in court

which I hope Your Honors will look at, but that is a general
publication.

11

I might mention that right now, as a matter of fact

12

there was intense dispute at the trial, and even more intense

13

dispute at the appeal as to whether the agents had told the

s4

truth as to how they put in this listening device.

13

the trial, at the pre-trial motion to suppress, the District

10

Judge ruled that he believed the agents and there was no tres­

17

pass and no illegality of any kind in monitoring.

However, at

18

Then on the appeal, in re-studying the whole thing for

19

the appeal, we saw that where was more, that there was just not!

20

smoke, but fire.

21

items in Idle record that really required further scrutiny.

22

I

Q

We felt that we were discerning suspicious

Except haven't you left out the fact that on the

23

motion to suppress before Judge Palmieri, the Judge himself

24

went up to the Waldorf-Astoria and they reinstalled the listen­

25

ing device, and recontructed the whole thing and he saw it with

9

1

his own eyes * and he spent two or three days canvassing all of

2

this?

3

A

I did leave, that out? and I am sorry»

But, of

4

course, we don't think that that matters.

S

that hurts our case, that Judge Palmieri did that, because we

6

think the agents didn't show Judge Palmieri what they had done

7

the preceding December.

S
2

m

Q

We don't think that

We are hardly in a position to decide whether you

are right or wrong about that.

That has been decided against

you, has it not?

n

A

Yes, it has, but we have briefed it here in a

12

way that we think entitles us to have this Court consider it

13

on review.
Now, I was saying when we got to appeal time in this

14

15

case, in the Court of Appeals, we went out and we hired for the

16

first time electronic consultants, and we hired the one that,

17

after inquiring, we thought was the best

one in the country.

The Government has disparaged this man's qualifica­

18

19

tions, and his name is Bernard Spindel.

I have here, if the

20

Court would \vish to receive them, three issues of a Life maga­

21

zine article about a year ago, or rather, two years ago, featur­

22

ing Spindel as the top, Number 1, electronic expert in the

23

country.

24

whether the Court would wish to have it, but if they do, I

25

would like to hand these to the Clerk also.

The article is interesting anyway, and I don’t know

10

1

Q

Is that in the record?

2

A

This is not in the record,

3

Q

4

Then we will hear from the Government on that

before we accept it»

5

A

I will give the Government a copy.

6

Our point in offering something like this, and my

7

point in arguing it, is that there is not much doubt in my mind

3

that one of the reasons we didn’t get more credence to our demo?

9

strations of dubious truthfulness on the part of the agents was

10

that our electronic expert was not credited as being an expert.

11

It seems to me there was just a bit of —■ I don’t mean

12

to use an impertinent term — but a bit of stubborness about

13

conceding that a fellow with a flamboyant style like that, and

14

a flamboyant place in society, could be an authentic, scien­

15

tific expert, which we maintain he is*

16

Q

Mr. Glasser, may I ask you, are you arguing to

17

us the credibility of those witnesses as against the finding of

18

the courts below?

19

A

I am arguing the credibility of the narcotic

20

agent witnesses in the motion to suppress hearing, and I am

21

arguing that to this Court because we consider that the indi­

22
23
24
25

cations are overwhelming that the agents could not have been
telling the truth.
In the Schipani review procedure there is always
open the duty and the possibility of new appellant scrutiny
11

1

where there has been trespassary eavesdropping.

i'

been for these prior decisions,, and the Department of Justice8 s

o

own very gracious program which was started during Mr. Justice

If it hadn91

i

4

Marshall's time

5

been for Schipani, we would have very faint hope of interesting

6

this Court in this point.

I see he is not on the bench — if it hadn't

But with Schipani in the picture , we think it would

?
0

be perfectly normal and right and necessary for the Court to

9

hear us in that argument, and determine whether our argument

10

has carried any persuasion.
Q

11
52

On evidence that is not in the record?

You want

us to decide on evidence that is not in the record?
A

13

We would be content — we made a motion and

54

filed affidavits in the Circuit Court of Appeals during the

55

pendency of the appeal asking them to pick up the Schipani

16

test.

Schipani had come down in December of 1966.

17

We were arguing before the Court of Appeals during

18

the months of January, February, and March, and we were bom-

59

barding them with motions and affidavits, asking them to enter­

20

tain a Schipani review.

21

22
23
24

25

Q

Wasn't Schipani a case where the Government came

forward and said, "Yes, frankly, this is illegal bugging”?
A

The Government acknowledged illegal bugging.

Q

Here the finding of illegal buggins is against

you, unless we are going to re-try the case.

A

I guess I have to really call a spade a spade,

2

then.

3

ceived the Department of Justice. We are sure that the Depart­

A

ment of Justice is not in complicity with anything wrong here;

5

we are positive of that.

6

matic.

7

You see, we think the narcotics agents must have de­

I am not just saying that to be diplo­

We are convinced of that.
But we do think there has not been, or we think the

8

presumption of official irregularity is not justified here.

9

the showing we have made, I think —-

10
11

Q

On j
i

On the Findings of Fact here, assuming that we

accept those, there is nothing to your bugging claim, is there?

12

A

Nothing to our claim?

13

Q

That this was a trespassory intrusion.

14

A

If you accept the findings of the Judge, there

15

is nothing to this, of course. We are asking that the Court

16

apply the Schipani and general Fourth Amendment scrutiny powers

17

that tiie Court brought into operation in those cases during the

18

second half of 1966, and where the Department of Justice has

19

been cooperating with the Court.

20
21

22
23
24
25

I might at this point interject that there is Presi­
dent Johnson's order of June 30, 1965.

There have been refer­

ences to such an order in papers filed by the Solicitor Gen­
eral's office in this Court, in a number of certiorari situa­
tions, reference to the President's order as having called upon
the entire Federal establishment to review whether they have
13

1

been engaging in any illegal electronic activity.

A,5

about, so far as one can determine from the Government's deseri^

3

tions of the President’s order, what that order contained.

That is

Now, we have been trying for a long time to get the

4
5

content of that order.

The Government has still not told us

G

the content of that order.

7

order which was disobeyed by narcotic agents, that they were

8

acting ultra vires,

9

instance of violation of due process of law than to be under

We think if there was a Presidential

and that there couldn't be a more classic i

10

process which has no law in it whatever, that is a usurpational

11

subordination of the Federal branch, invading privacy, vio­

12

lating not only the Fourth Amendment, but due process of law.
We hope that this Court will see fit to ask the

13
14

Solicitor General to disclose the contents of the President's

15

order.

16

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

Now there, again, off the record, I have a copy of
what purports to be the President's order,
last December,

I have had it since

I want to be frank with the Court,

know if I am allowed to have it.

I don’t

It reads to me as if it has

perfect similitude, it is authentic,

I know Government writing,

and I have been in the Executive Branch as a writer, and it
sounds real.
Now, if the actual order is like this one that I have
there will be another brief filed, still another brief filed in
I

this case by us.
14

1

2
3

Q

I don't think that I quite understand.

What is

this order that you are talking about?
A

President Johnson is said by the Solicitor

4

Gere real in the Black memorandum and the Schipani memorandum,

5

and one other memorandum filed in this Court, in which the

6

Solicitor General is working out his own approach in connection j

7

with monitoring — he said there is a Presdential order of

3

June 1965 addressed to the entire Federal establishment calling

3

us all to different standards of conduct in connection with

13
11

electronic monitoring.
There are a few other clues, and one clue is that the

12

President really only wanted it done where national security

13

was at stake, and he only wanted it done with advance permis­

14

sion and approval in each instance from the Attorney General,

IS

and he didn’t want any wiretapping, apparently, at all.

16

Q

What is the significance of all of this?

17

A

The significance is that the President’s order

18

is June 30, 1965, and the bugging in our case is December 1965.

19

The significance would be that the bugging disobeyed the Presi­

20

dent's order.

21

Q

And if it did?

22

A

It is usurpational, and we would practically

23
24
25

tender a Federalist Paper on that point.
Q

What do you mean? usurpation of what?

A

Executive power of the United States vested in
15

1

a President»

2

of his subordinates has it except as it is delegated.

3

exercise the power to see that the laws are faithfully executed,

4

and the power to enforce the laws in the President's name, and

5

in any enforcement action which the President has strictly for

6

bidden them to take, aren't they usurpers?

y

call names,

3

Q

9

The President has that Executive power, and none
When they

I don’t want to

I am trying to understand that.

This is an

argument independent of your Fourth Amendment argument.
A

10

Oh, yes? entirely so.

It has been pretty heavily

11

briefed.

I am sorry I keep talking boat it, arid I am aware of

12

my time.

I would like to save my remaining five minutes for

13

rebuttal, if I may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. 3EYTAGH, JR., ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BEYTAGH:

17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

18

the Courts

19

feel that the retroactivity of Katz is a question involved here

20

We have thought in our brief, and in the petitioners* briefs

21

heretofore -- this question has been brief extensively — this

22

question has been briefed extensively and we have thought that

23

this was the central issue involved in the case.

24

it is.

25

I am a bit surprised to learn that petitioners don't

I still think

As I understand it, petitioners8 contention is that
16

1

Katz somehow decided this question.

I don't quite know whether

2

that is what he means or whether he simply is saying that the
law always was that way, and in the light of some suggestions

4

made from this end of the bench, it seems to rue that is fairly

5

close to the accepted common law theory, which the Court in

6

Linkletter and subsequent decisions found it was not bound to

7

follow.
Well, it seems to me that that doesn't advance the

8
9

inquiry here very far because the question is whether this is

10

one of those situations in which the approach taken in Link-

11

letter and Stovall, and Johnson and Tehan, and several other

12

cases, should be followed; that is, that a decision changing a

13

constitutional rule of criminal procedure should not, for a

14

variety of considerations, be given retroactive effect to prior

16

Q

There is another way of looking at this case,

17

isn't there?

18

the police knew what they were doing was a constitutional vio-

19

lation, under Wolf against Colorado.

20

and the question was whether the sanction of evidentiary exclu­

21

sion should be applied.

22
23
24
25

In cases like Linkletter, and that whole area,

They knew it was wrong,

Here it is at least arguable, is it not, that the
policemen who relied in good faith upon their understanding
of the state of the law were not guilty of a constitutional
violation at all, because, after all, the Constitution makes
1?

1

illegal and illegitimate only unreasonable searches and seizures,,

2

and policemen who in good faith were relying on Goldman against

3

the United States, and their understanding of Silverman against

4

the United States in their conduct of electronic surveillance --

5

that arguably at least is not an unreasonable search or seizure,

6

isn't that correct?

7

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

3

Q

That is an argument available to you in this

2

case that was not available to the Government in the cases like

10

Linkletter.

11

available in Linkletter; isn't that correct?
A

12

Perhaps it was available in Tehan.

It was not

As I am sure Your Honor is aware, and this is

13

what you really refer to, the Court has not had this fact in

14

subsequent cases, holding decisions not to be retroactive, that

15

in the Linkletter situation the law enforcement officials in

16

the light of Wolf knew what they were doing, and State offi­

17

cials were wrong, and they went ahead and did it and the Court

nonetheless found that case —
Q

13

Analyzed as I have tried to suggest in my ques-

20

fcion, it isn't a question of retroactivity.

It is a question

21

of whether or not there was a constitutional violation in this

22

case.

23

A

Yes, Your Honor.

24

Q

Now, if the policemen did this tomorrow, they

25

would do what they did in the light of the Katz decision, and

their reasonableness and their conduct would have to be con­

stitutionally measured against the standard of the Katz deci­

3

sion,

decided, and since the Constitution talks about unreasonable

5

searches and seizures, it is arguable that we are not talking

6

here about retroactivity at all, but we are talking about

7

whether or not there was a constitutional violation at all?

0

isn't that correct?

But this surveillance took place long before Katz was

A

9

Yes, Your Honor, but the reason we ahven't

10

pressed that argument at length is that it seemed to us that the

11

Katz opinion itself suggested that it was not sufficient, and,

12

therefore, we haven't felt that we could press that argument

13

here,

14

Q

And Stovall suggested that this Court is con­

15

stitutionally charged with the duty of deciding cases.

16

policemen acted in the light of the state of the law.

if Linkletter applied, this case would have to be reversed.

20

22
23

A

That is not our understanding of the situation.

This is not consistent with the approach in that case,
Q

I thought you simply said if Katz was retroactive,

which is saying something different —

24

A

Yes, sir,

25

Q

I would like to hear you distinguish Linkletter.
19

i
2

A

I em not sure in what respect it would be in

my interest to distinguish»

3

Q

I am not sure, either»

4

A

The only point of distinction that is suggested

5

by petitioners is that in Linkletter the Court held Mapp to

S

be partially retroactive; that is, the Court held that the

7

Mapp decision would be applicable to cases on direct review at

S

the time that Mapp was decided, but not on collateral..

9

Now, as the Court itself pointed out, in the Johnson

10

opinion and again in the Stovall opinion, those decisions were

ii

made "without discussion" and they were made in per curiam

12

decisions without consideration or an opportunity to evaluate

13

and weigh these arguments, so we don't get really very much out
\

34
35

of that point»
It seems to rae that the Court has moved beyond that

16

in the evolution and development of this doctrine of non­

17

retroactivity and inappropriate circumstances,

18

can't see any point of distinction with Linkletter, and it seems

19

to me that that point is not —

20
21

Q

Beyond that I

What bearing, if any, on the issue in this case

25

does the recent decision of the Court in the Alaska case have?

It seems to me that it has a pretty direct
20

1

bearing.

2

sound argument», if you follow the analysis that we do» and

3

not the alternative analysis that you suggest» for holding the

4

Katz decision not to be retroactive.

5

I think that we have in our briefs developed a

It seems to us that the decision in Fuller, which

held as Your Honors know» Lee versus Florida» non~retrcactive,

is awfully close to the situation that we have here.

from a quick reading» there is soma discussion there.

admit that the Florida decision may cause them some difficulty»

12

and the suggestion is» because the statute was involved and

13

not the Fourth Amendment» and because it was a telegram and not

14

a telephone, that somehow this makes the difference.

15

They do

It seems to me that what the Court said in Fuller was

16

that all of the considerations that have been developed in the

17

previous cases are applicable in this situation.

18

is to enforce Federal law.

19

Linkletter opinion of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule»

20

and, of course» Katz is a Fourth Amendment case and develops

21

an exclusionary rule itself, to deter police from acting in an

22

unconstitutional manner.

23

The purpose

The purpose is delineated in the

It is clear that if that is the purpose, that pur-

24

pose can't be served by retroactively invalidating convictions

25

that have been based upon evidence obtained which, under the
21

1

new rule? would have been inadmissible.

2

So I think that the Fuller case is quite pertinent?

3

and I think all of the analysis applied there is applicable

4

here.

It seems to me that that confirms the approach that we
\

5

have suggested be taken to the retroactivity question,
Q

S

Except? again? if you concede any validity in

7

the theory I suggested by my question,, you have an a fortiori

8

case from Fuller? because in Fuller the police authorities

9

knew what they were doing? and it was violative of an explicit

to

Federal statute.

Isn't that corx*ect?

t!

A

That is correct.

12

Q

Whereas? here, by hypothesis? the law enforce­

13

ment agents, their conduct was measured by their knowledge of

14

the existing case law? and they did not? therefore, I assume?

13

knowingly violate the law? but in contrast with Fuller against

16

Alaska.
A

17

The problem for me? quite honestly? is that

sure.

have to assume that the agents were acting in accord with their

knowledge of the existing law, which was expressed in Goldman

4

and Silverman, and so on.

i

5

A

In this case» by contrast, I suppose we

I think adding to that point, as we pointed out

6

in our brief, although petitioners appear to dispute it, I

7

don’t know how they have the information, and I frankly don't

S

have the information, but it is not altogether clear if the

3

agents had known what the law was going to be, that they would

10

II

not have been able to get a warrant.
They followed, as far as we can tell, and in the con­

12

current findings of both courts below, it seems to me refute the

13

suggestion made that this Court ought to somehow seek to over­

14

turn these findings and this evidence.

15

The courts below both found that the installation was

16

made without physical intrusion into a constitutionally pro­

17

tected area, under the Goldman and Silverman, distinction.

18

Now, it seems to us that the reason the agents went

19

about doing it that way was because of the very reason that

20

they were trying to comply with the law as they understood it.

21

Whether they could have gotten a warrant or not had they known

22

that Kats was going to be decided and required a warrant, I

23

don’t know.

24
25

We point out in our brief, there is a case called
Pardo-Bolland versus the United States, decided by the Second

adjacent to an opening in a door between hotel rooms, but not

at all penetrating into or under the door.

That

6

It seems to us, as I indicated earlier, that all of

7

the considerations that the Court has developed applicable in

a

deciding whether a case should be retroactively applied or not

9

are pertinent here.
I discussed the purpose.

10

We discussed briefly the

11

question of reliance.

It seems to me it is quite clear that the

12

agents here did rely, and that other agents have relied on the

13

Goldman and Silverman distinction,

14

get a warrant.

Katz now requires that they

If we accept the findings that the installation here

15
16

was not trespassory, it seems to me that it was lawful under

17

the law that existed and because they relied upon that law and

18

because other agents in similar installations have obviously

19

relied on it, there is every reason to maintain that that factor

20

argues in favor of non-retroactivity.

21

Q

22

If your view as to Stovall prospectivity is accepted,

23

does that leave any vitality to Linkletter and Johnson?
A

24
25

Could I ask you a question, Mr. Beytagh?

I am not quite sure that I understand the

question.
24

Q

1

As I understand, what you are arguing here is

eu

the Stovall rule, which says that if a rule is made, and a new

3

rule is made, it is to be applied only perspectively, that is,

4

to cases arising after the decision, namely, that the man to

5

whom it is applied has had a lucky constitutional chance.

6

room does that leave for the Linkletter type of retroactivity,

7

meeting cut-off dates or Johnson-type retroactivity at the time

8

of.-the trial, beginning before the decision?

8
10
11

What

A

I think that it leaves very little room, Your

Q

That is what I understood you to say.

Honor.
I under­

12

stood the thrust of your retroactivity argument really was that

13

in the developing of this new doctrine, and, of course, every­

14

body would recognize it as a new doctrine, beginning with Link-

IS

letter and following through to Johnson and Stovall, that really

m

where the Court had come out on this thing in its last expres­

n

sion was that new rules are to be perspective only in the sense

18

19
20
21

22
23
24

25

of applying only to cases arising after the rules were announce^,
Am I wrong about that?
A

I just question whether those cases are pre­

cisely accurate.

Our view of STovall is that at the time of

the conduct, as compared with the time of the decision, any
conduct occurring thereafter would apply.
In the DeStafano case, which involved non-retroactivity
of jury trials, the Court necessarily related that to trials
25

<i

commenced , but the only way that you can ---

2

Q

What you really are saying, as I understand. itp

is that on your submission, the Katz rule would apply only to
actual baggings after the date that Katz was decided.

4

5

A

That is correct.

6

Q

And for that reason, I gather you come out with

7 i au affirmative view, and you say these petitioners are not enj
tilled to the Katz rule, and only Katz was entitled to that,

But Katz gets the benefit of the rule which was

are concerned, if your view in this case is settled, as to

I think as a practical matter, it is doubtful

that there are any.
Q

So the question here is, shall we adopt the same

14

rule that we adopted for Linkletter and Johnson, or shall we,

IS

rather, this being a new rule on your submission, should we

16

adopt the tests we laid down in Stovall?

17

A

That is correct, although Johnson is much closer

18

to Stovall and Tehan in the second case than Linkletter.

John­

19

son moved beyond that, and made it the date of the commencement

20

of the trial, and Stovall was on the conduct of it.

21

Q

This is a Fifth Amendment case, isn't it?

22

A

I don’t think so.

23

Q

The man’s own words were picked up.

24

A

That is correct, but it seems to me that there

25

is no compulsion involved here.

It has been suggested that

I

somehow this is involuntary confession, and we don’t quite under-'

2

stand that»

3

I don’t know that he was compelled to do anything.

I would like to turn ju3t for a moment to the re-

4

peated references to the President’s directive of June 30, 1965,

5

Petitioner has referred to this repeatedly, and the only reason

6

that it has not been made public is that it was specifically

7

indicated by the White House that it should be an internal

8

Government matter and kept confidential.

9

All of us who have worked with these theories of

10

cases, Schipani, and Black, and whatever in this case, and the

11

Attorney General in promulgating the directives that he has

12

promulgated, are completely familiar with what the directive

13

says and what it requires.

14

In the main it discusses wiretapping, and it dis­

15

cusses electronic surveillance only in a short and passing way,

16

and it simply directs that the Attorney General and the other

17

agencies be assured that the Federal Government and all of its

18

agencies are acting in compliance with existing law.

19

acted consistently on. that basis.

20

We have

We have informed the Court in any situations involving

21

trespassory bugging, and it seems to us that the whole thing

22

is much ado about nothing.

24

ment of Justice, or indeed the whole Federal law enforcement

28

and in conflict with a Presidential directive.

2

so, and I don't know what else really could be said about it.

3

It is simply noi

I would like to turn to several of the arguments made

4 | by petitioner that are really subsidiary in nature.

One of

5

them he views as a very important argument and he says that

6

even if you hold Katz to be non-retroactive, so that Katz does

7

not apply to his case, the bugging here was in violation of

e

existing law.

9

We don't quite understand that.

He seeks to get

io

something out of the Osborn case.

11

first place, was decided after the bugging occurred here, but

12

more importantly, in Osborn all we understand the Court to have

13

done was to say it was unnecessary to wrestle with the ques­

14

tion of whether LopeJ^ was still good law because in the Osborn

15

situation there was judicial sanction for the recording which,

16

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

The Osborn case*, in the

as Your Honors recall, was what was involved there, of a conver­
sation engaged in by the defendant and another person.
So it seems to me that Osborn doesn't advance the
I inquiry anyway. He suggested that Silverman decided this.

In

that case, the Court specifically refused to consider the ques­
tion of whether Goldman and Olmstead was still good law and
found it unnecessary to do so because it found a physical intru­
sion there, and the Court, as Your Honors know, concluded that
it would not extend Goldman even by a fraction of an inch.
But it seems to us that it is quite clear that the
29

fi

Court was still talking in ter,

2

tion »

of this trespassing distinc­

Now, further, it seerns to me am indication that the

3
4

law that existed prior to Kata was as we say it was.

5

the lower courts understood it to be this way, and we have

e

cited a number of Court of Appeals decisions which seek to

7

apply this distinction, and we cited them, and there are many

8

more.

9

In these, the Court denied certiorari»

All of

occurred during the time prior to Katz,

n

case itself, in which the Court decided that New York5s eaves­

12

dropping stitute was not sufficiently precise and definite to

13

be upheld constitutionally, the Court there said, in its

14

opinion, or repeatedly referred to trespasscry intrusions, and

15

that it could not allow a statute that was that broad and that

16

sweeping and that ill-defined to be a basis for sanctioning

17

trespassory intrusions into constitutionally protected areas»

But in the Berger

19

to us that it reflected the Court's view and notion of existing

20

law at that time»

21

that in Berger if that wasn’t its understanding of the law»

22

So it seems to me that petitioners are off base when they sug­

and that pre-existing law back to some point in time that I am

The finding of fact, as

Your Honors know, was not printed as an appendix in this case,

SO

so it is a little difficult to make references, but in the

11

appendix to the petition which was filed, the judge on page

45a, in Appendix B, made this finding:
"After en camera examination, the Court finds that

Exhibit 103 truly comprises all of these portions of

Government Exhibits 100 and 102 in which any defendant, in

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM GLASSER, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
i
MR. GLASSER: The call-out problem in our case would

13
14
15

exist only in relation to the Florida bugging.

We agree with

16

the Government that there is no real issue on Florida.
But there is a very severe issue, we say, in con­

17
18

nection with an allegedly abortive additional bugging in Georgia.

19

I haven't spoken of that today, but we briefed it pretty com­

20

pletely, and I would ask the Court to watch for that item, since

21

there was some mention here about the call-out problem, which

22

I think is before the Court.
Q

23

They didn't make any tapes at all, or get any

24

recordings, did they, in that second incident to which you

25

refer?
36

1

A

The agent who ran it said he didn't get the

2

tape , and 1 think one other agent who was in the car with him

3

said that they didn't get any effective, audible result.

4

again, we had a very hard, pushing hearing in which I, for one,

caxne away feeling that I was entitled to make a strong appellate

point against the credibility of those agents on that issue,

too.

What did the Alaska court hold?

They never touched this probleir that I am talk­
