ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. B. MILLER, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

6

Proceed, Mr. Miller.

CResumed)
Q

You may not b© able to answer this question, but

7

there must be about twenty «seven different interpretations, *>u

8

I was wondering9 number one, in a very few brief words what

9

the case is about, and secondly, to what extent are you

10

relying on my vain protest in the second California -case,

ii

to sustain your case?

12

A

13

I will answer the first question first.
As you know, the Court held in the first Louisiana

14

case that Louisiana owned none of the marginal sea, that

15

our title stopped at the inland waters, that we own the

16

inland waters under the doctrine of Pollards v, Hagen, and in

17

that case, and in the California case it was limited to

18

inland waters, with the result that we own nothing beyond,

19

the inland waters, and none of the territorial sea.

20

Following that, the Congress passed the Submerged

21

Land Act, by which they confirmed and granted to the States

22

a three-mile belt of marginal sea lying outside of its inland

23

\
waters,

24

belt, but in cases where the State.®s historic boundary

m

extended beyond three miles, it confirmed, it out to

it not only confirmed the grant to the three-mile

15

its

!

historic boundaries
The second Louisiana case held that we aid not

a
3

have a historic boundary extending three leagues as

4

contended, although this Court held and the Government con­

5

ceded in that case that we did own the islands within three

6

leagues of the coast; and that we also owned the water between

7

8

those islands and the shore because they ware so situated
as to enclose inland waters.
Now this case is to determine where the limit of

S
10

11
IE
13

14
15
16

17
18
19

the inland waters of Louisiana are* the inland waters that
belong to this State under Pollards v, Hagen.

22
23
24

Once you

determine where the inland waters are, then we measure three
miles outside of those inland waters for the purposes of
the Submerged Lands Act.
Q

Is that a part of the second California case?

A

Your Honor; we have felt that we must accept the

California case in holding that the Geneva Convention applies.
We may not agree with that, but that was the holding of
this Court.
Now, if you will remember, tMs Court in the Texas

20
2!

»?e haa

case and in the Florida case awarded both Texas and Florida
their historic limits.

Texas goes out three leagues and

Florida goes out three leagues.

But Alabama, Mississippi,

and Louisiana are brought into -their inland waters.
Q

But you certainly have a first point which we

25
15

1

argued yesterday

2

A

Yea if sir , but the inland waterways which we argueu

3

yesterday is the limit of our inland waters»

4

to do with our historic boundaries»

5
6

Q

It has nothing

You said that you conceded that the Chicago cases

and the Geneva Convention applies?

1

A

I didn’t say that we conceded that.

I say for the

8

purposes of our alternative coastlines, we have assumed that

9

this Court will follow the California case.

10

A

1 want to make it clear that nothing that I say

11

should be construed in any manner as detracting from our

12

primary argument.

13

in opposition to the restrictive? and narrow interpretation

14

of this interpretation that the Justice Department put on it.

13

They have come up with a line that virtually is a shoreline,

16

and it is my purpose to point out to this Court, that

17

or not you accept the inland waterways that Mr. ‘Sach.se

18

advocatesf there is no justification for the line that the
)

19

Government contends.
Q

20

We filed an alternative motion primarily

Your assertion is not limited»

whether

It rests primarily

21

on the argument which is practically -the same that I made

22

in the California case?
A

23

Yes* sir, to a great extent, Mr. Justice.

We feel

24

that the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and particularly

25

Louisiana, are so shallow, and they are so changing, and
17
>

t

1

there is no way for foreign commerce or any ocean-going

ff’i

&

commerce to go anywhere in Louisiana because of the shallow

3

waters.

4

Government has spent over $300 million dredging channels

S

into the ports of Louisiana.

6

and there would be no port but for these dredged channels.

7

We have had to dredge a channel.

The United States

There could bs no commerce,

This is a gently sloping shore, and it is of no

8

value at all to foreign commerce.

9

factors which this Court must take into consideration in

We feel that these are

10

determining what are the inland waters of Louisiana and

11

the Gulf of Mexico.

12

Mow, I have already alluded to the disagreement

13

between the Government and ourselves over the interpretation

14

of the Convention.

15

Convention is a general document, that it could not possibly

16

be held to cover every complexity and every detail of every

17

coast in the world.

Louisiana takes the position that the

We think it is like the. United States Constitution

18

19

and it must be interpreted liberally in order to make it

20

work.

21

stick to Idle letter of that document, that we can't go beyond

22

its four corners, and where it is silent it is prohibitive.

23

It denies to us principles of international law that were

24

well established.

25'

The Government, on the other hand, said wa have to

Q

What do you say that the Government says?

18

1

h

Where the Convention is silent, it is prohibited.

2

For example, the Convention is silent on whether or not

3

islands may be used to form the perimeter of bays or to

4

enclose inalnd waters.

8

The Government takes the flat position that 'that

6

means it prohibits, and we may not use the islands to enclose

7

inland waters.

8

that they have recognized along our coast, they do in. fact

9

use islands to form the perimeters of those bays.

10

Yet in every single instan.ce of every bay

As a result of this type of narrow interpretation

I'i

of this Convention, the Government has arrived at what we

12

consider as a shoreline.

13

inland waters of Louisiana from inland to the high seas.

14

It has changed the status of inland waters which have been

15

recognized by th±3 Court to be inland.

16

It has

A typical example of this is in

17

and Breton

18

Chandeleur Islands and by Breton

19

changed the status of the

Sounds.

Chandeleur

These waters are enclosed by the
Island.

The Government concedes, and listen to this, that

20

these waters are inland, but they say that they are inland

21

only because of the concessions they made in this prior case

22

where they admitted and conceded,when we were arguing for a

23

three-league

24

within three leagues were within the territory of Louisiana,

25

and all of the waters between the islands and main1ana

limit, they admitted that all of the islands

19

t

was so situated as to enclose inland waters.

2

This Court recognised this in the first Louisiana

3

case, and pointed out that these waters had become vested

4

in Louisiana, at the time it was admitted into the Union

5

and with our territory under the doctrine of Pollards v.

6

Hagen.

7

In the California case , this Court again recognized

8

that these waters were inland.

9

the Santa Barbara channel "which the Court had held connected

fo

two areas of the open sea, and in distinguishing these waters

II

from the Santa Barbara channele it pointed out Breton Sound

12

was a cul-de-ssc, that Chandeleur Sound led only to Breton

13

Sound, if it led anywhere, that neither served as a rout©

14

©f passage between two areas of the ©pen sea, and both were

15

s© shallow as to b© not navigable.

This is what makes it

20

so difficult to apply this

!

Now, these waters not only were recognized in the

2

first Louisiana case and in the California case, they have

3

been recognised as island wafers of Louisiana in a case in

4

1905 before this Court involving a dispute between Louisiana

3

and Mississippi.

6

of Interior drew in 1950 as the most landward position that

the Government could claim in these -waters recognised that

these ware inland, and enclosed the waters outside of the

They were again r@eogn.iaed by this Court in the

10

supplemental decree in 1965, because we were awarded title

12

to waters lying outside of Breton Sound.

13

Government says the Convention has changed all of that, that

14

there is now no legal basis for holding these waters to be

13

inland, that the Convention has reclassified them into the

16

high seas.

Q

Is that a Constitutional provision?

18

A

The Constitution provides. Your Honor, in Article IV,j

that Congress may not take away part of one State to form

another state, and that it may not add territory to the

21

out that the contraction of a State8 s boundary in the name

Q

The Government's claim rests at all on the Submerged

A

The Government's contention as I understand it,

is by virtue of the adoption of the treaty that there is now
no legal basis for these waters remaining inland waters,
but since they have conceded that they were inland, waters
in the earlier case,that they do not feel -that it is in the
public interest to withdraw that concession,

Mr* Millar, as I understand it, I thought you were

going to argue the case on the assumption that the Convention

did apply.

-Now what you are saying is that even if the Conventior

does apply, it should not apply in respect of these particular

points that you are raising t3uch as East Bay?

You are saying that even

if you apply the Convention, that is your alternative

argument, and 1 understand that —= if you apply the Convention
!

8

then you donJt apply all of the definitions in the Convention.

3

You take Louisiana's historical inland waters in

10

the case you were just discussing, which relates to East Bay.

n

If you take this Convention literally with respect to the

12

definition found in Article 7, wouldn't that rule out East

13

Bay?

14

Wo, sir. Your Honor.

Tell me why it would not?

2 think -that I can clear that up for Your Honor

right now.
We do not depart from the Convention.

We say that

23

the Government's interpretation of fchs Convention is wrong,

24

but that if you do follow the Government's interpretation,

25

then you must, hold the Convention to be unconstitutional.

Q

Just a moment, you must hold the Convention to

A

If you adopt the Government8s interpretation of it.

If you adopt our interpretation of it, you do not.
.Article 7 excepts the category of historic bays

from these mathematical formulae.

It is our position that

?

if a body of water has qualified as inland waters throughout

8

thehistory of this country , and if it has been the inland

©

waters and territory of a State throughout the history of

10

this country, then it is historic inland waters, and it is

ii

excepted from the mathematical requirements of this brand

12

new semi-circle test.

13

Q

Maybe I didn't understand you.

What you are

14

saying is that you accept th® Convention in this branch of

15

the argument except where it conflicts with what you argue

16

to b© Louisiana's historical territory?

17
18

A

No, Your Honor.

the Convention itself.

Historic bays ar© excepted in

Article 7 of -the Convention provides

19

that the foreoging provision shall not apply to so-called

20

historic bays.

21

Q

Then where does your argument about unconstitutional.!

22

play a role?

23

A

The Government says that they are not historic bays,

£4

that they are no longer inland waters, and that they are

25

high seas.

We say if that is a proper interpretation of

29

!

this Convention, than the Convention must be unconstitutional.

2

But we don't think it is unconstitutional.
Q

3

You say if you ignore what you say is the exception

4

in Article 79 the exception of historic hays* if that is

5

ignored^ then the result would be unconstitutional?
A

6

In East Bay that is true, yes, sir.
i

7

Mow Louisiana claims East Bay as historic waters,

8

not only in the legal sense we have just been talking about

9

as having qualified as inland waters previously, but also
in the historical sense of exercise of sovereignty.

10

At the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803,

11
12

and when Louisiana was admitted to the Union in 1812, there

13 J

was no mathematical requirement for a bay. There was no

14

limitation upon the closing line.

Th© only requirement was

I

15

j

that th© bay have the general configuration aid characteristics

18

of a bay and that its depth of penetration be such as to

17

enclose inland waters along its sides.

18

Certainly East Bay met this test, and this map

19

of 1838 shows the configuration of East Bay at that time.

20

Earlier maps show the same general configuration, and we can

21

assume that this was a configuration in 1812..

22

that its depth of penetration was sufficient to enclose

23
24
25

It is obvious

inland waters, and it therefore qualified as inalnd waters
of the State of Louisiana when it was admitted to the Union
and became part of the territory of this State under the

30

doctrine of Pollards v„ Hagen.

8

an attitude of general toleration among foreign states.

10

Nowe the Government said we have exercised no

11

sovereignty, but it confuses ownership with sovereignty.

12

It seems to imply that the United States must have openly

3

and expressly asserted a claim that East Bay was a part of

4

the territory of this nation.

Sovereignty does not mean ownership.

5

17

This is not necessary.
Sovereignty

is authority, it is the exercise of power or control.
It is less than complete territoriality.

This is made clear

by the

necessary for this classic type of definition of historic,

But it is not necessary that all acts of sovereignty

It is only necessary that they exercise some

Now, it is not inconsistent with the concept of

2

high seas to exercise limited control which is permitted

3

by the Convention within the contiguous zone? as,for example,

4

to prevent the infringement of your custom laws, the infringe- j

5

ment of your immigration laws, or your sanitary laws.

8

There is a fringe around the territorial sea over

7

which you may exercise limited control to prevent violation

8

of a nation’s laws within its own territorial sea.

j

;
9

But w© are not talking about that here.

We are

10

talking about the freedom of the seas, and the freedom of

11

the seas is where a nation may not exercise sovereignty unless

12

it is claiming these waters as its own, and the freedom

13

of the high seas which is set forth in the Convention on

14

the high seas are freedom of navigation, freedom of fishing,

IS

freedom of flight, and freedom to lay pipelines.

18

j

If sovereignty is exercised in any one of these

17

spheres, it is absolutely inconsistent with the concept of

18

high seas .

It can be justified oily on the basis that the

nation is claiming the waters as its very own.

I would have to presume that if Congress and the

16

President so chose, they could do it as long as it did not

Now, we have discussed the classic definition of

10
11

exercise of sovereignty.

W© have shown that East Bay has

12

qualified geographically as inland waters of this nation

13

since 1803, and in the Louisiana Purchase, and when Louisiana

14

was admitted to the Union in 1812.
This fact alone presupposes that all kinds of

13
16

sovereignty were exercised over those waters.

18

is a presumption that sovereignty was exercised over these

19

waters.

It is impossible at this late date to determine

21

every single act of sovereignty that has been exercised

22

by this nation, by this State, by the local authorities and

23

everybody else, but w@ will mention some of them.

24
25

Now, Mr. Sachs® has already discussed the Act of
1895 as a basis of the inland water line.

38

The Government

1

has objected to this, and contends that this Act is limited

2

to navigation, that it has no effect whatsoever upon anything

3

else except navigation.

4

interpretation, but for the purposes of our discussion ©f

2

ARGUMENT OP .ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

Mr. Cox.

j4

MR. COXs

Mr. Justice Black, and may it please the

)

5

Court, I think it will be helpful in the beginning if I go

6

back to the fundamental question in this case.

7

As we see it, the ultimate question is, where is

8

the coast line of the United States located in the general

9

area of Louisiana for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act?

10

The exact location of the coast line is important,

11

because the Submerged Lands Act conveyed to each State the

12

title to the resources not only up to the coast line, but also j

i3

for three miles beyond.

u

Consequently, while we are fighting about where

IS

the line is three miles beyond the coast line, that is neces­

16

sarily determined by the location of the coast, line itself.

17

It is more convenient to talk directly about the location of

m

the coast line.
Q

19

20

j

And you think about the coast line of the United

States, rather than the coast line of Louisiana, do you?

i

A

2!

We say that the coast line for the purposes of the

22

Submerged Lands Act means the coast line of the United States,

23

yes,

24
25

The two would be the same for all purposes, so far
as I can think, but we do mean for national purposes, Justice

55

'I

Stewart, and that is why I emphasized the coast line of the

2

United States,

3

Section 2(c) of the Submerged Lands Act defines

4

the coast line as the line of ordinary low water along the

S

coast which is in direct contact with the open sea, and the

6

line meriting the seaward limit of inland water.

7

There is no dispute, of course, about the first part

8

of the definition in this case.

9

mark along the coast where the coast is in contact with the

I

That is to say, the low water

10

open sea, although Louisiana denies that their coast is ever

11

in contact with the open sea.

I3

i2

The critical question, then, is about the second

13

part of the definition in 2(c) of the Submerged Lands Acts

14

Where is the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters?
In other words, what are the inland waters of Louisiana,

15

16
17

and where is their seaward limit?
Now, in answering this question, the first step is

ie

to determine ttfhere one finds the definition of inland waters,

19

inhere one finds the standard that he applies to the physical

20

features of this coast in order to find the inland waters,

21

22
23
24

25

Our view is chat you find it in the Geneva Convention
of 1962. defining the territorial sea and the adjacent water,
Louisiana’s answer is that you find it, her first
answer, in the regulations issued by the Coast Guard for the
purpose of telling vessels where they are to follow the

1

international rules of navigation, and where they are to follow

2

our own domestic inland rules of navigation»

3

The differences are illustrated on this chart

and

4

also on the small charts which 1 believe the clerk has handed

5

to each Member of the Court»
The green area is the area which was confirmed to

G
7

the United States by the Decree entered late in 1965, the

e

Supplemental Decree, which was virtually by consent»

9

other words, it is the area more than three miles from the

io

in

Coast Guard line.
The red areas here, and a little bit here, and then

ii
12

a bit over here, and another area in East Bay, are the areas

13

that were conferred to Louisiana by the Supplemental Decree

14

entered in late 1965«
Now, the pink area we concede goes to Louisiana,

15
16

There is no dispute about it.
I

Consequently, one comes down to the white area between

17

The dispute i.s over

Mr. Cox, did the red used to be pink?

If it weren’t

red, would it be pink?
A

Not in all cases.

It became red for several reasons.

It became red partly because of more accurate surveys
than had been available at the time the Interim Agreement was

57
]

1

drawn up* and it became red partly as a result of the Decision

2

of this Court in the California case, which as you will recall

rejected some of our claims with respect to the meaning of

dispute.
The pink area we now concede.

11
12

Q

As being inland Iwaters?

13

A

Yes.
I am sorry.

14

IS

We condede it belongs to Louisiana,

nad it is the territorial sea.

16

Q

As being within three miles from inland waters?

17

A

As being within three miles from the coastline, in

IS

some instances from inland waters, and in some instances from

IS

the shore, yes.

20
21

This map, in other words, Justice White, is a map that
deals in terms of boundaries and not in terms of the coastline.
Wow, I should make one other point about the map

22

23
24
25

:

clear.

Back of the pink line there is a lot of white area,

which is of course water.

That goes to Louisiana, too, but

there has never been any dispute about it.

58

i

There have been no funds impounded from it, and con­

1

z

sequently we didn't think it was worth coloring on the map,

3

Q

Where is that one?

4

A

These white area back here»

Those clearly are

5

inland waters, and I didn't want the fact that they are white

6

to mislead the Court»

is

Now, the first issue in the case deals with the

1
8

entire white area outside of the pink and the red lines.

9

The issue about the Coast Guard line will determine that,

10

11
12

Q

New, is that line on the top of the chart, there,

is that the Coast Guard line?
A

No, the Coast Guard line doesn't hardly show.

If

13

you look sharp, you will see about three-quarters of an inch

14

inside the yellow line.

15

line is the Coast Guard line.

16

17
18

That is three miles, and that dotted

I come next X think to answering the question that
was bothering you, Justice Brennan.
The second part of the case, that is, assuming that

19

we are right, that the Coast Guard line does not control —

20

the second part of the case, then, concerns that we would get

21

22

i

the white area outside of the blue line.
f
The second part of the case involves the area inside
i

23
24
25

the blue line, between it and ths pink and red.
In other words, Louisiana says they own out to that
blue line, under the Submerged Lands Act, under their

59

j

!

alternative, whereas we say they don't, go beyond what is pink

2

or red.

3

Q

That line istheir application?

4

A

Yes, so that

in the second part of the case what

S

you have is a series of disputes about, specific areas within

S

the fingers coming out# and then again this area here# and

7

again here,CallIon Bay, and another application here, and

8

getting around each of these, here is East Bay, and so on.

S

There are a series of specific disputas about the meaning

10

and application of the Convention, which really have to be

11

worked through one by one# although certain common questions

12

apply.
1 plan fce devote the first part of my argument to

13
14

15

the question of the Coast Guard line»
Q

As I understand it, Mr» Cox# looking

16

the line which you say

17

primary line is that

18

three miles out»

19

20
21

22

A

Yes.

is the seaward limit of

at your chart#
Louisiana's

line parallel to the Coast Guard line

In other words, the seaward linit of their

primary claim is the edge of the green.
Q

That is parallel to the Coast Guard line three miles

to sea?

23

A

Precisely.

24

Q

Just so I am cl%m: again, Mr. Cox, if that position

25

j

does not prevail, then what we are concerned with are only those

60

1

itfhite segments inside the heavy blue line from one end to the

2

other of the chart?

3
4

A

That is correct.
You see,, these are tremendous -- perhaps "tremendous"

5

is 'coo strong — and this is 27 miles, here, and they say that

6

the sea never comes within 20 miles from the spot, 15 and 10

7

in others, so as I say, I plan to deal first with the Coast

8

Guard line, and then second \^ith such of the more specific

9

disputes as I have time for.

10

With respect to the Coast Guard line, we urge first

11

that the United States against California should be decisive.

12

There the Court held that Congress used the term ‘'coastline,"

13

and "inland waters," in the international sense, as it had used

14

it in prior decisions, namely, the First California case.

15

Second, that Congress intended the Court to fill out

16

the meaning of "inland waters" and "coastline," by choosing

17

the best and most practicable definitionsr

18

'ted third, the Court held that the best and most

19

practicable definitions were those in the Geneva Convention

20

ratified by the United States in 1961.

21

22
23
24
25

Now, those three rulings, it seem to us, were dis­
positive of these issues in these white areas.
Louisiana argues, as I understand it, that the
decision in the California case was merely sort of permissive,
that a State could assert a right out to the line fixed under

C.

“i

1

the Convention, or it could, if it wished, assert a line out

2

under some other set of rules going beyond the Convention,

3

That seems to us to be inconsistent both with what

4

the Court said in. the California case, and also inconsistent

5

with what it actually did in its decree,

6

7

In the California case, on page 165 of 381 U*S.,
the Court saidr..

8
©
10

n

"It is our opinion that we best fulfill our responsibility by giving content to the words which Congress employed"
that is, in the Submerged Lands Act ---■ "by adopting the
best and most workable definitions available,
"The Convention provides such definitions,

12

13

:

We adopt

them for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act."
Then the Court went on to point out that this estab­

14
15

lishes a single coastline both for the administration of the

16

Submerged Lands Act and the conduct of our future relations.

17

This certainly doesn't sound permissive.

18

"It estab­

lishes a single coastline," and, "We adopt these definitions."
It doesn't sound as if they were to be Used on some

19

20

occasions and then not on others, if the State happened to

21

prefer.

22

O

Of course, the Court later on in its opinion rejected!

California's claim to Santa Monica Bay and San Luis Obispo

5

When it came to the decree which the Court entered

6

following the decision in the California case, the decree

?

recited as used herein, "Inland 'waters means," and I emphasize

8

the "means," "waters Xandvrard of the baseline of the terri­

9

torial sea, which are now recognised as internal waters of

10

the United States under the Convention on the territorial sea

11

and the contiguous zone."
If the word means what it says, there is no alterna­

12
13

14

tive.
Furthermore, in the second paragraph of the decree,

15

where the Court listed certain waters that it adjudicated to

16

be inland waters of California, it used the words that the

17

inland waters of California include specific areas that were

18

in litigation in that case.

19

Obviously, it didn’t i*ish to pre-judge California"s

20

claims as to areas we didn't talk about in that case, up

21

along the northern part of the coast.

22

1 think again the constrast between "includess"

23

in this paragraph, and "means" in the other paragraph, empha­

24

sises that the word "means", when adopting a general formula,

25

was deliberate, indeed as it was pointed out in the Supplementa!

63

1

Briefs to the decree»

2,

Louisiana's other argument, as I understand it, is

3

that the United States against California does not apply

4

because her coast has unique features»
Of course, the characteristics of all of the coastal

5

6

States are in some degree peculiar»

On the Alaska coast, it

7

is entirely unlike the North Carolina coast, and the Maine

8

coast is unlike the Louisiana coast, and the Connecticut coast­

9

line would be different from Oregon’s, and so forth»
If one said that a State may get out from' under the

30
11

Convention simply by calling attention to particular character­

12

istics, then every State’s coastline is thrown open to litiga­

23

tion.

U

The very purpose of the California case was to have

IS

the same coastline for international purposes and for the pur­

16

poses of the Submerged Lands Act.

27

The Court and the Congress incorrectly, I suggest,

28

would be put in the position of playing favorites among the

19

States if it used the Convention rules in one case, and some

20

other set of rules in another case.

22
22
23
24
25

So we think, as I say, that the California decision
is controlling.
I should in that connection mention one small point.
There are Coast Guard lines near some of the bays
in California.

There is none along the whole coast as there

64

1

is in Louisiana.

2

Neither party in the California case thought it

3

appropriate to invoke those lines»

4

invoked, but both parties thought that they were irrelevant, and

5

we so stated to the Court, as I remember it, during oral

6

argument, mentioning the existence of the lines»

7

They might have been

Moving along —
Q

8

Has there ever been any complete coastline there,

as in Louisiana?

9

A

10

Mo, and of course, Mr» Justice Black, there never

11

was any complete coastline drawn in Louisiana, until after

12

the Submerged Lands Act was passed»
The line has varied from time to time.

13

At some

}

14

times it has run along the east side of the delta, here, down

15

along the east side of the delta»

16

Q

Who drew it, then?

17

A

It was to begin with the Secretary of the Treasury,

18

and at one stage the Bureau of Navigation, and ultimately it

19

came to the Coast Guard»
But this whole expanse here that they now rely on

20

2!

wasn't drawn until after the Submerged Lands Act was adopted.

22

It didn’t exist at the time the Submerged Lands Act was passed.

23

Indeed, at the time that the Submerged

was passed, Louisiana's charts didn't mention this.,

j didn't even include East Bay.

65

The line

It ran a little bit up here, and

1

down around the Chandeleur Island-

2

where the edge of the green is now,

and then down roughly

3

That was the only line from 1935 until 1953.. a

4

period of almost 20 years, according to our study of the

5

records.
So that the line Louisiana is now invoking was pro­

6
?

mulgated after ‘the Submerged Lands Act was passed,

8

G

Was it drawn under the 1895 statute7

9

A

Yes,

10

That is, with changes due to the governmental

reorganisation, but it was basically the 1895 statute,
Wow, we say that even as an original question, for­

11
12

getting the California case, that the Coast Guard line would

13

be utterly unacceptable as a definition of inland waters for

14

the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act,
In other to put the two in proper relation, I think

IS
16

it is important that I go back azzd give

17

explanation of the history of the legislation dealing with the

!S

Coast Guard line and the various lines that have been promul­

19

gated from time to time under that legislation. •

I have it firmly in mind to refer to them.

3

In 1864f Congress enacted a statute later incor­

4

porated in the Revised Statutes, that promulgated certain

5

rules of the road, that is, navigation rules, for all United

6

States vessels anywhere, the kind of statute that Justice

7

Portas referred to as applicable earlier to vessels sailing

0

the high seas.
This applied to both naval vessels and to the merchant

9
10

11

[

marine.
In the 1.880s, there were a series of international

12

conferences on rules of navigation, and they came up not with

13

a treaty,but with recommendations to the nations who partici­

14

pated in them.

15

In 1890, Congress enacted a new statute which required

16

all U.S. vessels upon the high seas, and in all waters connected

17

therewith, navigable by sea-going vessels, to follow the new

18

international rules.

19

That was to take effect, some years later, and in the

20

interval, it became apparent that there was going to be some

21

confusion, because the old statute adopting the inland rules

22

still applied somewhere, and the nev/ statute still applied to

23

soma vessels somewhere.

24
25

In 1895, having been advised of this problem,
Congress enacted the statute that we are talking about.
67

It

I

appears on pagas 150 and 151 of the Government's Brief.

2

It said that the old 1864 rules, the inland rules,

3

should be followed on inland waters, and than it went on in

4

Section 2 and empowered the Secretary of the Treasury, and that

5

is the authority which has come down to the Commaneant of the

6

Coast Guard — it empowered him from time to time to designate

7

and define by suitable bearings or ranges, with light houses,

a

light vessels, buoys, or coastal aides, the lines dividing

9

the high seas from rivers, harbors, and inland watesrs.

10

Q

What does that mean, that is, Section 2?

11

A

It means that the Secretary, and later the Commandant ;

12

of the Coast Guard, is to provide or to define where the inland

13

rules are to apply, and where the international rules are to

14

apply.

15

Q

Why isn't that binding?

16

A

I think this definition is binding for the purposes

17

of this schedule.

18

Q

For the purposes of what?

19

A

For the purposes of this statute? binding for the

20

purposes of navigational rules.

21

Q

Just the rules?

22

A

Just the rules, yes,

23
24
25

Q

But it was to mark the boundaries between the inland

waters and the sea?
A

Which was to be done for a specific purpose, as

68

1

provided in the title of the Act, on page 150.

2

It is an Act to adopt special roles for the naviga­

3

tion of rivers, harbors, and inland waters of the United

4

Statas.

3

j

That was,the only purpose ever explained.

6

Q

I don’t quite understand why that was not the line.

7

A

It certainly is a line, for the purposes of this

Q

For the purposes of navigation?

10

Yes.

to develop them in a moment, Justice Black.

14

Q

All right.

IS

A •

It would be handy to indicate them.

IS

You can do that later.

First, we think that it is most implausible for

17

reasons that I will state to suppose that this Act authorised

18

the Secretary of the Treasury to define the terrioritial limits

19

of the United States for international purposes.

20

Secondly, we say that even if the Act should be con-

21

strued as having told him to lay out these lines in terms of

22

where our boundaries for international purposes were, he

23

plainly has never done it.

24
25

He has never done that.

He has never tired to do it.
he hasn't done it.

69

We say, consequently,

S

!

Q

This line was drawn?

2

A

This line was a line that the Secretary thought,

3

and later the Commandant of the Coast Guard thought would

4

be a good line tcraake the place where you shifted from the

5

international rules to the inland rules, and he has said so

6

over and over again, that that was the only thing he was

7

doing.

Q

0

Where did he say that?

9

A

The history is covered beginning on page 26 of

10
11
12

13

cur Brief, and riming on t© page 41.
Q

Where did he make the statement that you just

referred to?
A

Well, it was first made by the Coast Guard in a

14

publication in 1943, referred to on page 33 of our Brief,

15

toward the bottom of the page.
The Coast Guard Admiralty Law Enforcement Manual

16

17

at that point begins by explaining what is meant by inland

Q

What page are you on?

He saids
"Now let us consider another line of demarcation,

You find this repeated in the Coast Guard publica­

It simply marks hhe area within which the inland rules

I call attention to perhaps the most significant

13
14

of alls

In 1953, when the Commandant for the first time pro­

15

mulgated any line along the part of the area from here to

26

here — shown here — he said in putting out that regulation

17

that it was drawn solely for purposes connected with navigation

18

and shipping.

19

Q

That is on page 35?

20

A

Yes, that is on page 34.,

21

"And not to define or not for the purpose of defining

22

Federal and State boundaries, nor to define or describe Federal

2,3

or State jurisdiction over navigable waters."

24

from the Treasury Department references to the various Coast

\

72

1

Guard lines, and he explains in the letter, and I don't quote

2

it all, but he explained in part of it that different depart­

3

ments had adopted different rules for their purposes in the

4

United States, and sent the Coast Guard regulations among

3

them, and then after that, he went on and said, and this is

0

the part that 1 rely on particularly:
"It should be understood that the foregoing lines

?

8

do not represent territorial boundaries, but are for naviga­

9

tional purposes, to indicate where the inland rules begin

and the international rules cease to apply."
There again there is a clear recognition of the very

11

12
13

limited purpose of these definitions under the Act of 1895.

valid, even though that is not. inland waters, and in some parts,

20

of course, it is not territorial sea.

21

Q

Your position would raise chat question?

22

A

It raises that question.

23
24
25

1 would think that the Court would not pass judgment
upon it, and let me answer in two steps.
First, we do think it most unlikely that the 1895

73

]

1

statue was ever intended to give the Secretary of the Treasury

2

power to fix the territorial limits of the United States.

3

It just seems inherently implausible that in a little

4

Act dealing with navigation a section would have been put in?

5

the only explanation was that it was done at the request of

6

shipping interests in New York Harbor,, and that it would be

7

for this limited purpose.

3
9

10
11

12
13

We think it is inherently implausible that Congress would
have said that the Secretary is now

to fix the territorial

limits of the United States.
Q

Why is that strange?

Doesn’t the Government have

to act through somebody?
A

Yes, but it seems to me strange that it would have

14

been given to the Secretary of the Treasury, and second, that

15

it would be strange that it would be given simply in an Act

16

entitled An Act To Fix the Kules of Navigation.

17
18

ID

Q

The Secretary of the Treasury has the Coast Guard

under his jurisdiction?
A

Yes, but the questions of international law which

20

determine the territorial boundaries at he United States are

21

primarily under the Department of State.

22

Then there is one more point about the Act.

Of

23

course it provides that the Secretary 3hall issue the regula­

24

tions from time to time.

25

This doesn’t sound like fixing territorial boundaries

Q

It. interfered with it, and it was different from what

it was before.
A

We wars asserting authority under it, and I suppose

17

the structures that came up might interfere with navigation,

18

although there has always been a privilege to erect structures

19

in the high seas for light houses and other things of that

20

kind, without their becoming part of the territory

21

the United States.

22

of

That, in any event , today, is covered by International

23

Convention, but it is quite possible, I think, that what was

24

contemplated originally was that the Secretary of the Treasury

25

would be guided by the territorial boundaries, and that he
75

i

was instructed for the convenience of navigation not to fix

2

them, but to find them„ which are, I suggest, two different

3

things .

4

One is to apply the international rules, and trans­

5

late them into bx.ioys and light houses and the like, and the

6

other thing is to determine them.

7

But in point of fact, as I have suggested, whatever

3

the original intention was, neither the Secretary of the

9

Treasury nor anyone else has ever done this in terms of inter­

10

national law.

n

But from the very beginning, as we elaborate in our

12

Brief, the rules have been laid down in ways that do not con­

13

form either to this country or any other country's conceptions

14

of international law.

15

Q

Has the United States asserted jurisdiction over

1®

those waters for any other purposes, other than international

17

rules?

IB

A

We have taken positions in international conference

f9

after international conference quite inconsistent with our

20

saying that this is international waters.

21

22

Q

Let us say a ship of a foreign nation came within

three miles of the edge of where the white joins the green.
We would not say it was within United States territorial

24
25

waters?
A

No.

Indeed, Mr. Justice, so far as anyone knows,

76

1

we have never asserted against any ship flying the flag of

2

another nation, nor applied in any admiralty proceeding involv­

3

ing a ship of another nation, the inland rules, because of

4

a collision or sailing in this area,
I cannot say that a Coast Guard boat hasn't ever

5

hailed a foreign vessel»

But so far as this goes, this is a paper thing»
Q

8

Neither can anyone say it has»

Let me make sure that I understand that.

10

have never attempted to enforce domestic regulations against

foreign vessels?

on ■•many aspects of the case.
As against our own nationals, there is in Florida

a clear power to regulate shipping and shrimping and anything -

else.

17

Q

Of course, it may be that ships are going to observe

18

these rules.

19

A

I take it that they undoubtedly do, and I take it

20

that we have the power to ask them to do it, and if they

21

acquiesce,, then that is that.

22
23

All of the charts on any ship would show that the

Along the side of this line, it says "Use inland

rules," yes.

And they no doubt do conform.
Now, I am just speaking about the status of the rules

today.
First, I want to emphasize that under Louisiana's

7

8

view, and any view of Justice White, that the validity or

9

effectiveness of these rules depends upon these being inland

20

waters in the international sense.
They are plainly invalid today, because the Geneva

21
12

Convention as of today plainly fixes rules consistent with the

13

inland rules.
That Convention, which we have ratified, undoubtedly

14
25

takes precedence over anything that the Coast Guard has done,

16

so that the rules cannot be sustained today on the theory that

17

they somehow are fixing the territorial boundaries of the

18

United States in the international sense.

IS

be invalid under that theory.

21

22

24
25

Q

They are bound to

Well, without reference to the international rules,

let us take the domestic rules.
A

If they are to be limited for domestic purposes,

they apply only to our vessels.
Q

What is the boundary of this country?

But that is an international question.

78

That boundary

of a country is an international question.

means by the boundary of the country.

It depends on the force that the government can

exercise to fix its own boundaries.

That is what one

The theory was that the three-mile limit was a cannon

Q

It really is difficult to find the intent of Congress,

and all of this talk about the international rule is just as
a means toward that end?

11

A

That is correct.

12

Q

Plus the fact that we have decided a case on that

13

subject?
'

14

IS
16

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
23

A

You have decided a case on that subject, and it seems

to me that the reasons behind it are very sound.
I just want to give one more answer to Justice
White, and then I will come directly to that point.
There are decisions, Justice White, particularly
the English case of the Annapolis, which suggests that a nation
has the power to set rules of navigation, or requirements of
navigation for vessels approaching or leaving their ports.
I don't want to over-state it, but if that is sound
law, then that v;ould validate these rules simply as require­
ments of navigation, because for all practical purposes, vessels
coming in here are going to be foreign vessels going to the

79

1
2
3
4

ports of Louisiana.
Now, I come to the question raised by Justic Fortas:
What about Section 2(c) of the Submerged Lands Act?
We say that it cannot have meant the inland water

5

line as laid down by the Coast Guard or the Secretary of the

&

Treasury, for a number of reasons.

7

First, the evidence is very persuasive that the

8

term was us®d in the international sense, with reference to a

9

general body of international law.

m

This was the flavor of the debate.

There are

n

specific references

12

California case, where it clearly indicated that it referred

13

to and used it in the international sense, and there is

14

specifically legislative history which Justice Harlan asked

15

me about earlier with respect to the Coast Guard line.

15

to the Court’s use of the term in the earlj

There was testimony from Leander Peres of the Delta

17

area, and an Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana, which

18

referred to the Coast Guard line.

19

Remember, at that time this line did not exist.

29

Indeed, under the regulations, East Bay wasn't even behind the

21

Coast Guard line, and this was referred to in the testimony

22

pretty much, I think, in passing.

23
24

25

Did I say hearings on the Submerged Lands Act?
Because if I did, it was wrong.
It was referred to two Congresses earlier in hearings

80

'j

on previous bills»

2

the hearings before the Interior Committee of the Senate on

3

the bill that became the Submerged Lands Act, and Senator

4

Anderson cut in and said:

5
6

‘

Then the matter was brought up again in

"Well, we have been all through that, and we found
that that line wouldn't help us,"

7

It was the end of the discussion»

8

Of course, for any number of reasons, it might not

9

help, and one of them was that it affected very little of the

10

coast, and it seems to me it is most unlikely that Congress

11

intended to give some official in the Coast C4uard the power

12

to draw lines that would be decisive for the purposes of the

13

Submerged Lands Act.

AFTERNOON SESSION

1

2
3

MR. JUSTICE BLACKi

4

MR. COXs

We will proceed.

Mr. Justice Blacky and may it please

5

the Court*, the core of our position with respect to the

6

Coast Guard line comes down to these three sentences?

7

First# that when Congress spoke of the coastline

8

of inlands in the Submerged. Lands Act# it used those terms

9

with reference to international law and the territorial

10

u

boundaries of the United States.
Second# that whatever may be said about the original

n

purposes of the Act of 1895# or the meaning of the original

13

instructions to the Commandant ©f the Coast Guard or the

14

Secretary of the Treasuryf that he has not for years defined

13

a line in terms of international law or the territorial

16

boundaries of the United States.

17
18

Consequently# the Submerged Lands Act was talking
about one thing#and the Secretary of the Treasury and the

19

Commandant were talking about another thing# and that other

20

thing is irrelevant for the purposes of this statute.

21
22
23
24
25

Inland waters isn't a word# I might add# that in­
variably must have one meaning.
Louisiana in a statute enacted in 1948 defined
the term “inland waters'8 to cover only waters where the tide
ebbs and flows# end excluded all others from that.

82

1

We are not going to argue that that is -the meaning

2

of inland waters , but I simply show that this term, like

3

others, must be construed with reference to its context and

4

what was intended to be done»

5

I move on, therefore, t© the second part of the

6

case, to the areas behind the blue line, which is Louisiana’s

7

outermost claim, and offshore of the red or pink which we

8

concede is Louisiana»

9

Our position is -that the status of those waters

10

is to be determined by applying the Geneva Convention in a

11

practical and common-sense manner, in accordance with its

12

terms, and that if something does not qualify as inland

13

waters under the Convention, then it is not inland waters

14

for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act, ana that this

15

is true of all our coasts and therefore specifically true

16

of the coast of Louisiana,

17

In that connection, I think it is worth looking

IS

at the Geneva Convention, and calling attention to a few

19

things in support of my proposition that it is intenaeu to

20

be universal and exclusive.

2!

Since we omitted to print the full text, it may

22

be fairer to use the text as printed by Louisiana, which is

23

in the appendix, the third volume of their briefs, beginning

24

at page 127,

25

I would call the Court3s attention, first, to
83

3

1

Article 3 on page 12 8 —

2

“Except as otherwise provided in these artic3.es, the normal

3

baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea

4

is the low water line along the coast as marked on the large-

5

scale official charto™

6

limits of the territorial sea;

So that, unless one can bring himself within an

7

exception elsewhere provided in these articles;, the coastline

8

is the line along the coast, the low water line along the

9

coast as marked on the large-scale official charts»

10
11
12

We are not this explicit, that that is the line,
except as provided elsewhere in the Article»
Lest any question arise, I should call attention

13

to the word "normal", which it seems to us is quite clear

14

in this connection and means the line according to rule,

15

the line according to standards, and not some word like

16

"generally" or "ordinarily" or "usually»'’

17

This is very clear from the history»

18

At one stage, without attempting to quote exactly,

19

20
21
22
23
24
25

the predecessor of Article 3 did include words like "generally'"
and the word "normal" baseline was in the title»
Then for the specific and explained purpose of
making it clear that there was no discretion except as pro­
vided in the Convention, those words "generally18 or "usually"
were stricken, and the explanation was given that the purpose
of the Convention was to provide exclusive uniform, sets of

84

1

rales „

2

Q

3
4
5

You say the word "normal™ doesn°t mean more or less

the same thing as "generally speaking" would mean?
A

That is right»

I think it means according to

standard,, or according to rule.

I point out that this,
\

6

through many versions,, did not have normal in it.

7

"normal" was put in only by the drafting committee, and only

8

when it was decided to give up titles and for some reason

9

it was put in -there, and I think it simply means the baseline

10

according to rule.

11
12

The word

In other words, the drafting committee wouldn't
have been authorised to make such a major exception.

13

Now, there are other articles that make it; quite

14

plain that the Convention was defining the territorial sea

IS

and contiguous zone of the

16

exclusively.

17

Q

coastline, both inclusively and

Your submission is that Article 3 would have the

18

same meaning as it does have if the word "normal" were not

19

there at all?

20

A

Absolutely.

I think history shows that without

21

any question.

The whole purpose of the Convention was to

22

establish a uniform set of rules applicable to all nations.

23

Indeed, another incident that tends to show this

24

is that at one time there was an effort in the preparatory

drafts fc© state whafc was international law, and then new

It leaves that to each

The draftsmen were very careful to avoid saying

11

it is three miles, leaving anybody to claim more if he wanted

to, so as to leave in question what, was the breadth of the

14

that it is no more than three miles.

We have always taken the position,

Q

How does the three league situation square with

the Geneva Conbention?

?8

A

Geneva just defines where it starts.

19

Q

And you say the United States never claimed more

20

21

than three miles?
A

That is

true, and I think that we would not recog­

22

nise the Texas three leagues for international purposes.

23

We have to recognise it for rights in the continental shelf,

24

but not for international purposes.

25

Q

You don’t think that was a historic boundary, then?

86

t

Well, it was a historic boundary of Texas as used

A

2

in the Submerged Lands Act, but of course it was found that

3

Louisiana's historic boundary did not oo out three leagues.

4
5

6

Q

I wondered whether it was in the Geneva Convention,

the three“league provision.
A

If the United States chose to say three leagues,

j

7

it would not be in violation of -the Geneva Convention, because j

8

it doesn't decide it.

9
10
11

s

That is the difference between the three miles

Q

(

and the twelve miles?
A

That is correct.

What I was stating was not our
i;

12

interpretation of the Convention, but what I understand

13

the position ofthe State Department to be.

14

that Article 7 not only defines a bay by inclusion but by

IS

exclusion.

16

n
18

Q

I was saying

j
Could I just ask you, does Louisiana rely to any

extent in any of yor arguments on Article 4?
A

They certainly refer to baselines from time to

19

time, and I am not sure whether they do or whether they

20

don't.

21

didn't, but as I read their brief they from time to time

22

say that the Coast Guard line should be regarded as the

23

baseline.

24

25

Q

;

I thought I heard Mr. Sachse say yesterday that they

In the negotiations between the United States and

Louisiana, have any of their agreed-upon locations of the

87

coastline rested upon agreements under Article 4?

2

A

Oh, no.

We have always asserted, and the State

3

Department has always asserted that it is contrary to the

4

policy of this Government to draw a straight baseline.

5

Q

You mean even where the Geneva Convention permits

it?
We have never drawn straight

baselines0 although there are some places perhaps where we

could„

10

Q

But if it permits them., you canat rely on the

11

Geneva Convetnion as precluding it for purposes of this

12

lawsuit?

13

A

Well,, the Geneva Convention says that a .‘Straight

14

baseline shall be the boundary where it has been drawn a

15

certain way, and as Justice Harlan said in fch© California

16

case* the United States hasn't drawn any straight baseline,,

17

and therefore there are no straight baselines for the

18

purposes of this case,,

!

19

20

Q

If one had been drawn, the situation would be

different?

21

A

Yes,

Perhaps it should be insisted that one be drawn

23

if one had been drawn.

in this lawsuit.
A

But it is not for this Court to settle that matter

of foreign policy, whether we should exercise the permission.

policy.

Q

You say that the United States as a litigant in

1?

this lawsuit has the option of precluding any resort to

12

Article 4?

13

A

I would say the United States# which is a litigant,

14

which is also concerned with its foreign policy# has the

13

option of deciding whether to draw a straight baseline.

13

This was adjudicated.

17

Q

So that your answer is, "yes", that the United

18

States can just say, nWa elect not to permit any resort

13

to Article 4 in this lawsuit'1?

20

A

That is the effect of our position.

We state

21

something that is much more important than that.

22

part of the foreign policy of the Government is involved.

23
24
25

Q

An important

It is an important part of this lawsuit eis far as

we are concerned.
A

That is right# but I suggest if this Court should

89

1

say that we elect to draw a straight baseline, that that

2

would have a very important and unfortunate effect on the

3

policy that the State Department has been consistently

4

following.
If the Court does it,the State Department will

5
6

have to live with it.
Q

?

That may be true.

I -j-ust wondered whether or not

3

there was any issue in the lawsuit under Article 4, and

9

I understand there is not,
A

10

I tried to say honestly I wasn't clear about

11

Louisiana's position on that, and 1 can't say that there is

12

none.

13
14
15

We say that there is none.
Q

But, as 1 understand it, if I understand it, if

you rely on 4, it is only as to the Coast Guard?
A

I think that they do make the suggestion

that

15

Justice White made, and it slipped my mind, that maybe the

17

Court should draw some baselines, which we object to for

IS

the reason I stated,,

19

20
2!
22

Q

And your answer is that it is beyond the power

of the Court?
A

Yes, and I would further answer that the Court

has already decided it in the California case.

23

Q

When did they decide it in the California case?

24

A

I don't have the language directly in front of me,

25

but there is a passage in Justice Harlan's opinion -chafe

90

I

1

recognizes that only the United States,and apparently he

2

is speaking in terms of the Executive Branch of the Governmnet, j

3

can draw straight baselines, and they had elected to draw

4

none, and he said that straight baselines were not applicable

5

in that case»

6

Q

I have the opinion here and I will check it.

7

Q

But you said that baselines didn8t apply?

8

A

I thought he was referring to it, and. he might

9
10

be referring to the Legislative Branch, too.
the Judicial Branch.

But it is not

Thank you very much.

1 was arguing that the exclusive rules must be

|

j

13

found within the Convention, and it is the sole determinant

14

of what is the. coastline of the United States for the purposes ;

15

of the Submerged Lands Act.
I want to emphasize some of the implications of

16
17

what I was saying, so that there could be no mistake about

18

it.

19

j

First, I implied that arguments based on geological

£0

phenomenon, or economic uniqueness, are irrelevant either

21

in general or as applied to specific instances.

22

Th© Convention deals with what one might call

23

cartographic phenomena, and the thing as shown on the charts

24

of mariners, and other considerations are irrelevant under it.

25

j

Second, I imply that the mere former theories of

91

f

1

the United States with respect to international law or the

2

rule as to islands and so forth

3

to time advanced

4

lias been frozen in the Convention»

which we have from time

are no longer applicable because the matter

5

Specifically, Louisiana9® argument;, that under

S

some rule espoused by the State Department at periods in

7

our history before the Geneva Convention,is simply irrelevant

8

for the purposes of this case, just as our theory with respect

3

to Monterey Bay and the ten-mile bay was held in the California

10

case to be irrelevant, because it was simply something that

11

we had propounded at

12

Submerged Lands Act, but was not embodied in the Convention»

the time of the enactment of the

Next, 1 specifically mean to-imply the point I

13
14

touched on before, that there is no basis for claiming

15

straight baselines under Article 4 because neither -the

16

Congress nor the Executive Branch has ever promulgated

17

straight baselines under Article 4.
Certainly there has been none by the President or

18
13

the State Department, and the Coimnondant would hardly be

20

the apporpriate official»

21

Q

Has he done it?

22

A

But he has not done it, we aay,and we say that

23
24
25

for several reasons»
First, when he put out his lines, he expressly
said he was not claiming anything for territorial purposes»
92

i
2

3
4
5

So he can't have been promulgating straight baselines under
Article 4.
Q

Whatever the purpose was, has he outlined any

straight line base?
A

He drew the line three miles inshore of this yellow

8

line for the purposes of defining which rules of the road

7

should apply.

8

had attempted to draw it as a straight baseline under

8

Article 4, would be invalid for two reasons.

10

He

certainly did that.

His line, even if he

In the first place, no ona can argue that this

11

part of the coast is deeply indented or cut into or has a

12

rim of islands along it, within the language of Article 4

13

which limits the places where you can draw straight baselines.

14

Secondly, Article 4 limits the points between which

15

you can draw straight baselines and they don't include buoys,

16

light ships, and ranges bearing on underwater shoals and

17

things of that kind.

18

So that it is clear again that he couldn’t have

19

done it even if he tried, and of course what he did quite

20

plainly wasn't an effort.

21

j

The fourth thing that I mean to imply by saying

22

the Convention applies and is the exclusive standard is

23

that it is a very sharp limitation on both historic bays

24

and the evidence that will constitute a historic bay.

25

first I want to emphasise that Section 6 of Article 7 applies

93

But

!

|

3

only to historic bays.
It doesn't speak of other historic waters.

2

It says

3

historic bays.

4

nature of a bay before this exception could possibly apply.

5

But the kinds of evidence that will be sufficient

6

7

One,, therefore, must have something in the

i

to constitute a historic bay are very limited,
Q

Excuse me, if you don't mind being interrupted,

8

I notice that Section 6 of Artie1© 4 says that a coastal

9

State must clearly indicate straight baselines on charts,
so due publicity must, be given. How is that to be read?

j

•.

10

If there is a line, is it that it must be stated

11
12

13
14

is
16
17
18
19
20
21
22

23
24
25

by the State that it is a straight baseline?
A

I should suppose that the State must assart, “We

are claiming this as our territory."
Q

It is not that we are drawing this line as a

straight baseline?
A

1 would think that it was satisfied by saying, "We

are drawing this line and claiming that all of the waters
behind it are our inland waters," but I think that it must
mean at least that the State that draws it is giving notice
to all of the world that it is claiming it as its waters.
Of course, the Coast Guard has always indicated
that we weren't claiming it as our waters.

All it has said

is that you shall follow our inland rules, and asserted the
limited purpose, and not a claim of territorial sea.

94

Now, the other point X was going on to make was

2 ;

that the kind of

sufficient»

?i

any more than we had to rest on it in the California case»

12

The evidence that Louisiana invokes here for the purposes

13

of claiming historic bays rather plainly seems to me the

14

point of anyone advancing jurisdiction»

15

But X don’t have to rest on that point here

20

>

i

Even more clearly, old maps like the Commerce

21

Department maps, to which you were referred this morning,

22

which were drawn for limited purposes, do not constitute

23

an assertion of jurisdiction as against other states in the

24

international sense»

and ostensibly applicable in these waters are not sufficient*

3

as the Court held in the California case* because they do

not involve an actual enforcement of jurisdiction against

5

a foreign nation.

s

Now* the only specific things that Louisiana refers

to anywhere are a series of criminal prosecutions under some

8

of their natural resources laws«

9

those points.

10

There are three answers to

First* so far as we know* all of those offenses

'II

12

territorial sea* the three-mile strip within the bay.

13

of them* one can tell from the records* were within that

Second* all of the defendants so far as the in­

16

stances they gave us were concerned were residents of

17

Louisiana* and therefore presumably are citizens of Louisiana*

18

and under this Court's decision in Sceriotas in Florida*

19

Louisiana has the power to regulate their conduct on the

20

high seas just as much as anywhere else.

21

22
23

j

The third point is what one of our fifty States
does*in our view* is irrelevant.
Now, against the background of those generalizationsf

24

1 would like to take what time I can on some of the specific

25

areas that are in controversy.

We are talking now about, the material between

Q

I start at

Hasn’t Louisiana argued that at least to the ex

5

tent of what ia an exercise, surely the drawing of the

8

Coast Guard represents such a baseline?

7

A

I think that they did,

I would say that the drawing

8

of a line with the statement we ar® not exercising sovereignty,

9

we are doing it for a limited purpose, is not an acceptable

10

assertion of jurisdiction, because we are saying that we are

11

not asserting territorial jurisdiction over this,

12

Although you, yourself, indicate, I gathered,

that even this assertion was questionable?

15

enforce it.

16

Q

17
18

I indicated that the question of whether we could

It was an assertion of something,o£ soma

significance?
A

We never did apply it, and as a pronouncement

19

we always limited it, so that what it is I insist or suggest

20

isn’t anything more than it purports to be, which was a

21

statement we want and

22
23
24
25

wq

will require you to follow our

inland rales.
This was never challenged, and there has been no
violation which was tested in the courts and so there was
a case in an admiralty suit or something of that kind.

97

Q

1

2

"We will require you to follow" — wouldn't that

be an assertion?
A

3

If limited to the statement that, "We will require

4

you to follow", and it was never applied, I wouldn•t think

5

that was an adequate assertion of jurisdiction, because

6

there has been no bringing of it to bear.
Actually, so far as I can see, the only area where

7
8

this can come into

play is at East Bay, because that is

3

the only thing that could be called a bay, and I don’t mean

10

a strict bay, but a bay in the loose sense, and this area

11

certainly could never be called a historic bay.

12

no bay about it, and Article 7„ paragraph 6 is limited to

13

bays.

14

There is

I was about to start at the west end of the coast­

15

line and take the segment which runs from Sabine Pass here

16

to Tigre Point, which is on the coast about here.

17

You will note that our line and the Louisiana

18

line, when it applies the Convention, follows the coast

19

except for these fingers reaching out? curiously they even

£0

reach out into the area which has already been adjudicated

21

to be ours, and those are the dredged channels, to which

22

Mr. Miller referred this morning and which Louisiana claims

23

are pat of her coast under the Convention.

24
25

These channels appear not only her® at Sabin® Lake,
and Calcasieu Pass, and at Freshwater Bayou, but there are
98

'i

other points along the coast where such channels exist, and

2

consequently this is a recurrent problem, and it seemed well

3

to deal with it at the outset.

4

First I want to point out that last statement on

5

page 336 of the brief, that the Congressional history of

S

the Submerged Lands Act clearly shows that both the Senate

7

and House of Representatives considered dredged ship channels

8

to be part of the inland waters of the United States, that

9

that is not applicable.

10

The facts are theses

History does show -that at

11

one stags the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular

12

Affairs considered, and there was in the bill, a definition

13

of inland waters which included all estuaries, ports, harbors,

14

bays, channels, straits, historic bays and sounds,,

'

15

Whether this included dredged channels or not is

16

anyone's guess.

17

of English Channel, or some other body of water, between

18

an island and the mainland, rather than something leading

19

out perhaps 20 miles into the ocean, but I can't say that

20

I am right.

21

My guess would be that it is in the sense

But certainly I am as right as they are.

The next thing that is clear is that this language

22

was deliberately struck out of the bill in an effort to

23

leave the definition of inland waters antirely to the Court,

24

so that no one can infer that there was any intention to

25

include these areas.
99

■

1

2

tod we come to consider the question, like ail
other questions* in terms of the Geneva Convention.

3

The question turns on Articles 3 and 8 of the

4

Convention.

5

provided in these Articles, the normal baseline for measuring

S

the breadth of the territorial sea is the low water line

7

along the coast.63

8
9

Article 3 we noted before* '"Except where otherwise:

Mow I ask you, keeping that in mind* the low water
line along -the coast, to jump to Article 8 which begins at
the very bottom of page 130 in the Louisiana appendix,
"For the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the

12

outermost permanent harbor works which form an integral

13

part of the harbor system shall foe regarded as forming a

14

part of the coast."
So that the question we have to ask ourselves is

15

IS

whether a dredged channel leading out from & port is a

17

part of the permanent harbor works within the meaning of

18

Article 8.

19

We submit that such a channel * even though marked

20

by aids to navigation, and buoys, and in some places day

21

beacons and lighthouses and the like, is not a part of the

22

permanent harfoor works* that the term harbor works refers

23

only to raised installations, like piers and jetties and

24

breakwaters, but which,although man-made, are a physical

25

part of the coast.

100

j

1

I rest that conclusion on several things.

2

In the first place,, 1 don’t think just a matter

3

of the ordinary use of words , one would normally think of

4

a dredged channel or of a channel that has not been dredged

S

that leads out from a port, which was secured by a river,

as part of the harbor works.

7

usage.

8

Q

What about the steel towers we were shown?

9

A

I would say that those were like any lighthouse

It seems to me an extraordinary

10

on a reef offshore, and both prior decisions show that those

11

are not part of our territory, and the discussions in the

12

Convention show that a lighthouse was not to be treated as

13

part of the territory of the literal state unless it was

14

fixed to the shore.

15
16
17
10

Q

Mr» Miller says that the material that is dredged

up is piled on the side of the channel.
A

It never gets up above the water or, if it does,

it isn’t connected to the coast.

IT is all under water.

19

Q

It is not connected to the coast?

20

A

Well, when I say coast, I mean land or physical

21

structures above water.

22

neath, you could find some connection,

23

the land above water, and this is not above water.

24
25

Q

I suppose that if you were under­

3

A

If these were banks, and by banks I mean something

4

that was consistently or continuously above the water reach-

5

ihg out from the coast, then we would have a harder time of

6

it? but they aren’t,

7

Q

Excuse me,

How do you think that we ought to

decide that, Mr, Cox?

9

A

10

-How do I think you ought to decide it?

I haven8fe seen

11

■these, and the Court hasn’t seen them, and we don’t have an

12

evidentiary record before us, do we?

13
14

A

I don’t think anyone contends that there are

banks that run continuously above the sea level,

15

Q

Perhaps I have misunderstood Mr, Miller then,

16

A

Certainly I don’t understand Mr. Miller to foe

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
23

saying -that.

1 am prepared to assert that they do not,

I am not prepared to assert that soma little pile of earth
doesn’t occasionally get up there.
Q

You think we ought to decide, for instance, on

the basis of a general proposition of law that unless
these mounds show up above the water 'they don’t fit within
the definition?
A

X think you should say that an area of water is

not to be assimilated under Article 7 to something that is
102

1

spoken of as permanent harbor works, forming, part of a coast,,

2

because the coast means in the Convention and in usage in

3

this area something abov© water.

4

If the notion was to make these water areas

part
3

5

of the inland waters, the place to have dealt with that

6

was in the sections on bays or inland waters.

7

likely place to have dealt with it would be in the area of

8

roadsteads, because there the Convention, and there is

9

in .article 9, was dealing with areas of water off the coast

The most

10

in the sense of something above the land, and the Convention

11

said that, "Well, we will make these part of the territorial

12

sea,"
They didn3t even make them inland waters,

13

They

14

said it would be part of the territorial sea, even though

15

they lie more than three miles offshore.

18

rna that if there had been any intention to treat these areas

17

of tester with their lighthouses and towers to distant points

18

along there as belonging to the literal state, that was the

19

place to have done it.

And it secans to

Now, there was a proposal to make buoyed channels,

20
21

and it didnet say anything about whether they were dredged

22

or rott, to make buoyed channels and give them the same status

23

as roadsteads, and the International Commission rejected

£4

that.

25

l

We think,while not conclusive,

it points in the
I

103

1

direction of showing and confirming the inference that I

E

would otherwise draw., that these water areas were not assimilates

3

to something that is above water.

4

Q

I thought the question was whether this:-was an

5

outermost permanent harbor work or integral part ©f the

6

harbor system.

7

A

But one finds Article 8 saying that that shall be

8

regarded as forming part of the coast.

9

ing it as part of the coast strongly suggests that the

10

I suggest that treat­

draftsmen had in mind things above -the water.

11

Otherwise, it would have, been extraordinary to

52

say something was nothing but a water area but it should

13

be treated as if it was something out of the water.
It just seems to me an exceedingly odd way to

14
15

coma at it.

56

Q

\7
18

The history I refer to I suggest confirms that.

The structures along those dredged channels along

■the side — these-are not just buoys?
A

Some are buoys and some are tripods, and they are

19

not connected to one another? they are just like many lights

20

and fixed buoys and fixed lights along the New England coast.

21

22
23

Q

Every few hundred yards.

If there was something

anchored along the bottom, that would be the same thing.
A

Not unless they are connected above the water.

24

They are not as frequent as every 100 yards, and they are

25

essentially like many aids to navigation, that they put in

104

the high seas, maintained lighthouses.

privileges.

Q

They have certain
I

Would there be a harbor at either place along the

dredged channel?

5

A

Oh, yes„

It would be very hard for vessels of

6

any size to get into the harbor, 1 presume that there might

1

still be a harbor.

8
9

Q

A

j

They were built to give vessels of greater draft

than could previously get in access to the harbor.
Q

12

13

I think that -they were built to make possible in

each instance a harbor.

10
11

There certainly would be inland waters.

If they extend the harbor system at all* they

surely would b© a part of the harbor system.
A

14

I would say harbor system means fixed structures

15

above the water.

16

thing that there can be a low water line on.

17

have a low water line on an area sticking away out here.

18

It is a physical impossibility.

For one thing we are talking about some­
But you can't

I would like to ask you before you go- on, do you

20

agree with Mr. Miller there is no need for a master in this

21

case?

22

A

I have thought a great deal about that, Justice

23

Harlan, and I would like to divide my answer into several

24

parts, always directing myself, I think, to your question.

25

First, it is entirely clear t© me that the initial

issue,

2

resolved by the Court now»

the effect of the Coast Guard line, should be

But, second, there are a very considerable masher

3
4

of other issues which can't foe elucidated by any further

5

factual evidence, and I think that those should foe decided

&

by the Court new»
Also, 1 recognize that it might be

1

of some aid

8

to the Court to have an experienced master, an expert master,

9

go through them and winnow them out»
But despite that, 1 am very sure they would all

II

b© back here with as long briefs and much -the same arguments

12

if we all lived long enough»

13

they would foe back before the Court»

14
13
13

Q

The Court would foe here, and

You are posing all of these questions and you

want us to decide all of them?
h

I was going to say as against the advantages of

17

sending it to a master,from the Court's point of view, in

18

terms of the total administration of justice, if this case

19

went to a master with nothing decided on the Coast Guard line,

20

no one would know whatever to put in or what not to put in,

21

and the result of course would foe everybody would dump in

22
23

24
25

all of the evidence that he could find»
I think the total effect would be a worse morass
and the Court would have it all back here»
Mow, the last part of my answer. Justice Harlan,
106

1

is that there are some points of the argument where there

2

appear to be some questions of fact»

3

are real questions, but on the face of the briefs they seem

4

to be here»

work of resolving the questions of law now, it would turn

6

out that there were no significant factual differences

7

among us„

1 do think that if the Court, were to do the

Court must face a large number, I think all of these ques-

10

tionSa

But i don't want to pretend it isn't a difficult

11

matter of balancing»
What I do want to urge very strongly is that w©

12

13

be given all of the guidance and that the master be given,

14

if the Court decides to send it to a master, all of the

IS

guidance it can.
The question that I am talking about is one that

16
17

can be resolved here, and many of the other questions can be

18

resolved herea

19

we could get part of -the money distributed and We could

focus on specific issues in subsequent proceedings, and I

2!

think it would be a more efficient way to administer justice»

22

Q

If there remain some others, then at least

Mr. Cox, if I felt comfortable that there were

23

no issue of fact that has been posed between you and

£4

Mr» Miller with respect to the dredged channels, I would

25

feel more comfortable about your last observations.

He has two minutes, and perhaps he will enlighten

you on it.
Q

Do I understand you correctly, that those red

areas are mors than three miles from the coastline?

9

A

HO

Q

They are all within three milas?

1?

A

They are all within three miles of the coastline

12

Ho.

as we interpret the coastline.

13

Q

Is that true of that little red area in East Bay?

14

A

Yes.

The reason is that you will remember when

15

you draw the coastline, you swing a three-mil© arc from

16

any low tide elevation.

17

Q

And any island?

18

A

But it is not so much the island here as it is

19

j

low tidal elevations within three miles of the mainland.
Q

And the United States sticks to its concession

on the east there,, on that string of islands?
A

I don’t know whether I am trespassing too much,

but we don’t claim that.
Q

That would be another, I suppose, assertion of

the United States beyond the three miles?

103

II

A

Well, at one time

Q

In terms of the Geneva Convention.

At one time -the State Department was asserting

4

that a rim of islands within perhaps six miles or later

5

perhaps ten miles of each other, an area like this, did

enclose inland waters*

7

8

the view of the Government was that we should apply the posi-

9

tion of the State Department in 1953.

10

It was.the position of the United

Until the decision in the California case,

So we applied it here*

Now, we learned two things later, first that that

11

wasn't international law, and it was our claim, but it wasn't

12

international lav/, and second that we weren't governed by

13

the position of the United States in .1953 but by the Geneva

14

Convention, as the Court held in the California case*

15

Now, the result was that if there was nothing

16

more than that, we would have applied the Geneva Convention,

17

but a lot of things have happened.

18

We had said the opposite to this Court and the

19

authorities relied on it, and there had been leasing, and

20

people had relied on it, and we had repeatedly dealt with

21

Louisiana in these terms, and it seemed to ms that it was

22

not suitable and becoming to the United States, having gone

23

that far, to suddenly say, “Well, we made a mistake, and

24

we are sorry that we led you all into this, but we insist

25

now on backing out."

MR,, SACHSEs In the short Lima left to me, if

Honors that Mr, Cox is in error about East Bay,
The navigation laws of the United States, pub­

13

inland waters of the United States at the time of its publi­

Q

Could you give me -the beginning of that?

A

Navigation laws of the United States, of 1940,

published by the Department of Commerce of the United States.
Q

Does it have a line?

A

It describes tha line just as it was described

before*

:•

It is not a chart, it is a book, but it is there.
He is in error,in our opinion, in his reference

to the Annapolis, which I think is so important in relation
to Justice White's question, because there the British
said precisely that their right to regulate foreign vessels

110

I
1

i

was limited to their own jurisdiction* so they are ini ana

waters .

'■i

We think it is perfectly clear that Justice Stewart

3

4

raised a proper point with reference to the word, "normal"

5

in the Geneva Convention.
It couldn’t have been put there meaninglessly by

6
7

all of the' people who went to that Convention when the wora

8

"normal” indicates that if an abnormal situation, exists* a

9

different treatment is to be accorded.
I have one final word.

10

The State Department may

11

have the right*for our Government * to act in determining

12

whether our boundary is three miles, or three leagues* or

13

14
15

IS
17

a greater number of leagues from our coast*but the Congress
confided to the Secretary of the Treasury not to the State
Department the right and the duty to mark the outer limit
of inland waters.

20

21

And he did so by these lines

which have been on published charts for years.
And when I asked the Commandant of the Coast Guard

13
19

He did so.

last year* when he proposed to change these* if - any foreign
government or any foreign vessel or anyone else had ever
protested that line* he said* "If there is such a protest*
we will advise you."
Q

And none such has been given.

Did you say that these existed on charts for

years?
A

Yes* there have been large charts which showed all

of this line starting back from 1895.

I would certainly think so,Justice Black. If not,
