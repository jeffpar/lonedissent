MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

No. 645/ John Davis,

petitioner; versus the State of Mississippi, respondent.
Mr. Zarr, you may continue with your argument.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELVYN ZARR, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ZAR.R:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

I would like to summarize the major points I made

yesterday and then say a few things about the record. The major
points were these:
1.

That the petitioner was caught up in a police

2.

That the two detentions of petitioner yielding

dragnet.

the two sets of fingerprints were illegal arrest because, in
the first place, in neither case was there a warrant or any
attempt to show exigent circumstances excusing a warrant; and
secondly, even assuming that the warrant requirement could
somehow be excused in this case, there was no attempt by the
State to show probable cause for arrest.
Next, the fact that these arrests were for investi­
gation only explains, but cannot excuse, the failure to comply
with these constitutional safeguards.
Last, that fingerprints are not excepted from opera­
tion of the exclusionary rule.
Now, counsel opposite stressed to the Court yesterday
27

i

that the Decembez' 3rd detention, the first detention, was not

z

an arrest, and apparently relied upon the court below's ruling

3

which in relevant part appears at page 59 of the record, which

4

I shall just briefly read.

B

The court below said this:

"The officer said that he arrested appellant, but

6

the evidence, which is in no way contraverted, shows that

7

appellant was merely escorted to headquarters for inter­

8

rogation as, in fact, were numerous others in the course

3

of an investigation by police of an unsolved major crime»

510

It is clear from the record that there was no intentio

11

arrest within the accepted legal meaning.of the word»”

to

12

Of course, there are two answers to this:

13

clear from the record that that statement is wrong; that the

14

only testimony in the record about the December 3rd arrest is

15

that of Officers Griffin and Thompson in which they say they

16

arrested the petitioner and there is nothing to contravert that.

17
18

The second answer, of course, is that this was an
investigative, arrest and

that, as we have argued, is illegal.

19

I have two evidentiary points.

20

1.

I want to stress that the petitioner had done

21

yard work for the woman.

22

makes that clear.

On page 17, the interrogation there

Next I want to stress that even though Mr. Justice
Stewart yesterday correctly observes that she testified that
*

"There was no doubt in ray mind about it that Johnny was the one.
28

fi

i

1

at other placas she was not quite so positive.

At page 22„

2

previous to that, she says, "I recognised it was Johnny.

3

thought it was, but I wasn't perfectly sure right chan, but then

4

I knew that nobody else had been in the house but him.

5

him to carry a table through the kitchen where he threw the

6

light where the meter was."

I

I asked

7

On page 30 of the record, on cross-examination, she

8

says in response to the question, "But by light of the flash­

0

light, could you see his face?”
"Answer:

m

Yes, sir? true.

He had that fascinator,

if

which is a headpiece, over it and I could see through that

12

crocheted part his face and I recognized him, or at least that

13

is who 1 thought it was.
Q

14

Going back to the first three points you made

in summary, the last of which was, or the third of which was,

15

that fingerprints are not excepted from the exclusionary rule,

16

there is the Bynum in the District of Columbia.

17

Are there any other cases on that point?

18

A

19

Not that we could find, Your Honor, that dealt

exclusively with fingerprints.

20

Q

£1

That is what I am talking about.

Thank you.

(Whereupon, at 10s10 a.m. the argument in the above-

22

entitled matter was concluded.)

23
24

I was pretty sure it was.”
