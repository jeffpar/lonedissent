ARGUMENT OF ANDREW A. VANORE, JR., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. VANORE:

7
8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
I am Andrew A. Vanore, Jr.

I am a member of the

10

staff of the Attorney General

1i

represent the petitioners, the State of North Carolina and

12

1-3
14

18

in North Carolina and I

Warden R. L. Turner in this particular case.
The single issue involved in this particular case
is upon retrial for the same offense which has been set aside
on appeal for first conviction proceeding due to a Constitutional
defect in the first trial.

The second trial court imposed

a harsher punishment upon the defendant.
The facts, briefly stated, are:

Clifton A. Pearce,

19

the respondent in this particular case was initially tried

20

at the May 1961 term of the Superior Court of Durham County,

21

22
23
24
25

North Carolina on the capital charge of rape.
Upon arraignment the prosecuting attorney, or the
solicitor, announced that he would not seek a verdict in excess
of assault with intent to commit rape.

The jury found the

defendant guilty of assault with intent to commit rape and the
3

1

judge imposed a sentence of 12 to 15 years upon the defendant.

2
3

The defendant started serving this sentence on May 25,
1961.
In 1965 the defendant filed a petition under the

4
5

First Conviction Relief Act questioning the admissibility of

8

the confession introduced against him in the first trial.
Relief was denied by the Superior Court of Durham

7
8

County on May 10, 1965 and Certiorari was accepted by the

9

Supreme Court of North Carolina which reversed the case and

110

j

awarded the defendant a new trial.
The defendant was released from custody upon the

11
12

first sentence imposed upon him on February 2, 1966.

13

particular time he had served four years, eight months and

14

six days flat time and six years# seven months and It days1 flat

15

and gained time,

13

days granted to the defendant for each year of service on the

17

sentence.

13

At that

the gained time being computed upon 150

The defendant was tried the second time at the

19

June 6, 1966 term of the Superior Court of Durham County, upon

20

an indictment charging assault with intent to commit rape.

21

The jury found him guilty of assault with intent to

22

commit rape and the presiding judge who specifically stated

23

in his judgment that he was taking into consideration the

24

fact that the defendant had served six years, seven months and

25

16 days flat and gained time, was going to impose a sentence
4

I

z

of

eight years upon the defendant»
The judge stated in his judgment that it was his

3

intention to impose the maximum sentence allowed by statute

4

for the offense,, which is 15 years»

5

gained time, and so forth, he reduced it to eight years.

8

Q

However, because of the

That factor in this case that bothers me.

7

sentence the first time around on the first conviction was

3

12 fco 15 years.

The

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

And the second time around it was eight years.
*

11

A

Yes, Your Honor.

12

Q

Now, do I understand that it is the rule in

~

13

North Carolina that you do give prisoners on their second

14

conviction credit for time served?

15

A

That is correct.

16

Q

That is a

17

A

That is a

18

Q

Does that

19

A

20

credits -—

21

Q

rule of law?
rule
include gained time?

That includes gained time, yes, sir.

All

So when this fellow was given eight years

22

sentence at the second trial if he had served the whole eight

23

years without any reference to additional gained time, he would

24

have had to serve another one year and five months.

25

A

That is correct.

The trial judge, in taking
5

1

1

into consideration the gained and flat time that the defendant

2

had served, reduced it or deducted it from the maximum sentence

3

allowed under statute, 15 years.
He did not reduce it from the minimum sentence that

4
5

was imposed on the defendant at the first trial.
Q

6
1

but 15 years?
A

8
9

You mean the sentence here was not eight years,

The sentence was eight years.

However, the

judge said, "It is my intention to give you a sentence of 15

TO

years.

However, since you have served this particular flat

11

and gained time upon the first sentence which was less than

12

seven years? since you have served that time I am going to

13

deduct that time from the maximum of 15 years and impose an

14

eight-year sentence upon you."

IS

Q

So he got eight years.

IS

A

He did in fact-- -

17

Q

Now, if he had been given credit for the time

18

served under the first sentence, including the plus gain time,

19

he would have had only, as I said before, he would have had

20

only another,what was it, year and five months to serve?
A

21

That is correct.

Assuming that the second

22

trial judge would be prohibited from increasing his sentence

23

upon the second trial.

24

Q

25

mean that.

well, he would be, wouldn't he?
I don't mean that.

No, no, I don’t

I don't mean that he would be.
6

1

No, I don’t mean that he would be.

I mean to say that he had

2

already passed sentence and the sentence was eight years; is

3

that right?

4

A

That is correct»

S

Q

Not 15 years, but eight years.

6

A

That is correct.

7

Q

Now, does the North Carolina law rule that

8

you just recited with respect to giving him credit for time

9

served, plus gained time, apply to that eight-year sentence?
A

10
1 1

It applies to the eight-year sentence, yes.

But perhaps I am not making myself clear.
Q

12

Well, 1 have struggled with this on the basis

13

of the briefs and I am still

14

at this thing literally this fellow is due to be sprung about

IS

now.

16

A

bewildered because if just looking

Well, I don't think there is any question about

17

it but because of the eight-year sentence, he is going to have

IS

to serve some additional time other than he would have been

19

required to serve under the first time.

20

The reasoning of the trial judge is that he could

21

have in fact imposed a 15-year sentence and if you give him

22

all credit for time served under the 15-year sentence which

23

he is required to do by the decision of our Supreme Court, then

24

he still, in fact, has left to serve seven years.

25

Q

I know, but my problem here is, is this in truth
7

1

and in fact a case ■— does this case really present a situation

2

in which the second sentence was greater than the first sentence

3

A

It does if you compute the time that he would

4

have to serve in an indeterminate sentence, 12 to 15 yearsj if

5

you compute it from the lesser of these two sentences imposed,

a

from the 12-year sentence»

7

Q

Twelve year sentence -- now when would he be

8

entitled to get out, including maximum gain time which this

9

fellow steadily has earned?

10

A

/
He would have been entitled to get out after

11

having served eight years, five months and 22 days of actual

12

time on the first sentence»

13
14
15

Q

All right»

Now that is bound to be less than

the time he has got to serve under his second sentence»
A

That is correct.

If we were to assume that he

16

would be given credit under both of these sentences, the

17

defendant would have to serve an additional sentence of one

18

year, 10 months and 10 days because of the new trial»

ID

Q

Not because of.

This is much too elaborate.

20

computed this yesterday on the basis of the brief and I have

21

a very serious question in ray mind as to whether we are, in

22

truth and in fact, faced here with a situation in which the

23

man would serve longer under the second conviction than under

24

the second conviction,

25

A

Of course, the District thought so —
8

I

1

Q

Apparently the District Court had an idea that

2

what had happened here was a 15-year sentence.

3

it was an eight-year sentence under the second conviction.

4

A

But it wasn't,

The District Court was of the opinion based on

S

the Fourth Circuit Court's opinion that the flat and gained

s

time served under the original sentence would have to be deducte<

7

from the minimum of an indeterminate sentence.

8

not deducted from the 12 years, but rather from the 15 years,

9

that would be informative that the District Court found in

10

this particular sentence.

Q

1 1

12

Since it was

Mr. Vanore, has this man been out on bail at

all?

13

A

Yes, he is

14

Q

When did he get out on bail?

15

A

Approximately six months ago.

16

Q

Then except for that six months he has been

17
18
19

out on bail

now, Your Honor.

out on bail, but for this new trial he would be out for good.
A

No, I believe that he would still have to

serve approximately a year and a half of the second sentence.

20

Q

He would have to serve a year from today?

21

A

Well, not computing the time that he has been

22

out on bail, yes.

23

Q

So he would just about be out now; is that right?

24

A

That is correct.

25

Q

And solely because he made the mistake of going
9

1

to the Court and solely because the mistake the Court gave in

2

giving him a new trial,, he has

3

that it?
A

4

5

Justice.

6

consider.

7

got to serve more time?

Well, no, I don’t quite agree with you, Mr.

I think that here we have two points that

Q

Isn’t

we must

Speaking for the man, I imagine he has very great

8

difficulty in seeing anything other than he has got to serve

9

more time solely because he was given a new trial.

10

A

Well, I am sure he feels that way, ^es.

1 V

Q

Doesn't he have a little reason to feel that way?

12

A

I do not think so based on the principle of law

1-3

that I think the case brings up before this Court whether or

14

not the Patton rule which prohibits an increased sentence or

15

which prohibits the State from giving the man a sentence over

16

and above the sentence that was given at the first trial.

17

think that questions the very basis of our system of jurispru­

18

dence in that it

19

trial judge, is going to punish this roan for exercising a

20

Constitutional right of appeal.

21

Q

22

me take two

23
24
25

I

that the trial judge, the second

Mr. Vanore, let me ask you this question.
situations.

Let

Now, suppose the judge in this case,

in the second trial had said, "I give you the same sentence
that you were given in the first trial, subject, of course, to
the law of this State that you are entitled to credit for the

10

1

time you served plus the good credits that you received."

2

that is one situation.

3

Now

The other situation is what we apparently have here,

4

where the judge says, "I am going to figure out for myself what

5

credit you are entitled to under your first sentence and on the

6

time that you served, and I am therefore going to give you a

7

sentence of eight years at this time."
Now, under which of those two situations will the

8
9

man have to serve the most time.

10

A

11

under both situations.

12

Q

Oh, I can't -—

13

A

Maybe I misunderstood your question, then.

14

Oh,, he would have to serve more time under the second

15
16

situation.

He would have to serve the same amount of time

11 beg your pardon.
Q

Isn't the question that we are interested in

17

here, can a judge give a man more time on his re-sentence

18

than he got on the first one, where hia case had been reversed.

19

A

So long as it cornea under the
yes.

statutory maximum

20

allowed for by the statute,

I think that is the question,

21

whether or not a judge can give more time on the second trial.

22

Q

Well, that is what I wanted to get oriented on.

23

A

Yes.

24

Q

How does, characteristically,

25

the North Carolina

lourfe effectuate the statute which requires credit?
11

1

2
3
4

A

The second-senteneing judge takes into

consideration
Q

He just doesn8t say* I am going to give you

15 years without regard to the credit, then leave it up to the

5 prison authorities to

—

6

A

It is done both ways»

?

Q

Is it done both ways?

8

A

Yes? he can say that --

9

Q

I am going to give you 15 years and the prison

10

authorities will credit you with the time already served.

11

A

Yes, or he can compute it himself.

12

Q

And here he did it the other way?

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

Is it clear that he did it the other way?

15

A

It is to me.

16

Q

So that the prison authorities would not give

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

him credit for any more time on his eight year sentence?
A

No, they gave him credit

Q

Do you think the judge has already given him

all the credit he deserves?
A

Yes.

Q

So he

He specifically stated -will be in no position to claim any more

:redit from the prison authorities on account of the sentence
:hat he had already served?
A

That is correct, because at the time that the
12

1

second-sentencing judge imposed sentence he had before him --

2

0

At least that seems to be the basis on which

3

this case comes here?

4

A

Yes.

He had before him the prison records which

5

showed exactly how much gained and flat time this defendant

6

had served on the first sentence.
Q

7

Because if he was still entitled to credit on

3

the eight-year sentence for all the time that he had served

9

before, there wouldn't be much time left, would there?

10

A

That is correcto

11

If we compute it from th© maximum that would be

12

allowable under the statute, he still has approximately six

13

years to serve even by way of the Patton Court's reasoning.

14

He has additional time to serve, and I believe that Judge Butler

15

16
17
18

points that out in his order, ordering the State to re-sentence
him or to release him and of course the State when he came on
for hearing before the State judge the judge refused to order
this man re-sentenced.
Judge Butler, thereupon, entered an order requiring

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

his immediate release and that is why we appeal to the Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals which in a Memorandum Decision based
upon Patton versus North Carolina affirmed the District Court's
holding.
0

Mr. Vanore, this second trial was held before

the same judge as had presided at the first trial, or not?
13

II

A

I don't believe so, no»

2

Q

You can't make any difference?

3

A

Well, 1 think that the argument might be

4

greater if it were held before the same trial judge as was

5

done in the Sanders case from California that the second trial

6

judge might have more reason, perhaps, if

7

that the trial judge is going to be vindictive, that the second

8

judge might have more reason for imposing a harsher sentence»
Q

we want to assume

In both cases, both the first trial and the

10

second trial in this case is what I mean, the sentence was

11

Imposed by the judge, not by the jury?

12

13

It is imposed by the judge in North Carolina by

Q

And the jury's function is only to find guilt

statute.

14
15

A

>r innocence?

16

A

That is correct.

17

Q

And the jury in your

18

State has no function with

respect to fixing the severity of a sentence; is that right?
A

19

Except in capital cases the jury can return a

20

verdict of guilty without leniency and thereupon the defendant

21

-s sentenced to death.

,22

;he statute provides automatically for life imprisonment.

23
24
25

However, they can

impose leniency and

Q

In this kind of a case it is a matter for the

A

In this kind of a case the judge has the complete

Iudge.

14

I

discretion to impose any sentence which he deems necessary

2

under the facts.
The only prohibition that is put upon the second-

3
4

sentencing judge is that the time served under the first sentence

5

which was-- -

6

Q

Has to be credited.

7

A

— has to be credited and the time served under

8

the first sentence and the time imposed under the second

9

sentence

10

Q

Cannot exceed the maximum.

11

A

— cannot exceed the maximum allowed by statute, i

12

Q

Now, you have already alluded to your position

13

which perhaps you will amplify a little further because it is

14

emphasised in your brief that it is improper to assume that

15

a judge —* whether it be the same judge or another judge --

16

in the same court after a second trial would be vindictive and

17

would be motivated to penalise the person for having appealed

18

his first conviction.

19

I understand that position.

What would you say if

,20

there were proof that

21

in fact* vindictive?

22

"Well, you appealed your first conviction and 1 don't think that

23

was proper.

24

expense and trouble and now a jury has found you guilty all

25

the second-sentencing judge had been,
What if he had been frank enough to say,

¥©u have put the State through a great deal of

over again and since you did appeal your first conviction I am,

15

I

hereby,going to sentence you to twice as long a sentence within

2

the statutory maximum.”

3
4

A

That would be a flagrant violation of the man’s

Const.!tutional right to appeal.

5

Q

Of what Constitutional right?

6

A

The Constitutional right to appeal without any

7

fear of reprisal and our Supreme Court so held in a case

8

called State versus Patton where the sentencing judge first

9

imposed a fine on the individual and then the individual gave
i

10

notice of appeal and the sentencing judge thereupon, struck

11

his first sentence of a fine and he imposed active time.

12

Our Supreme Court said that this was a flagrant

13

violation of the man's Constitutional right to appeal without

14

fear of any reprisal.

15

Q

Well, now, how often do you think that you could

16

adduce evidence that the motivation of the second-sentencing

17

judge was a vindictive motivation of that type?

18

A

I think it would be extremely difficult to

19

adduce that type of evidence.

20

though, since as I see it our whole system is based upon the

21

22

good faith of judges. We have to assume that the sentencing
\
judge is not going to b® vindictive, and if he was vindictive

23

he could easily circumvent the rule that was applied in Patton

24

by imposing the maximum sentence the first time around.

25

I think that we have to presume,

Then there would never be any question about it.
16

?

Q

Did your Court hold that that sentence would

2

be void* unconstitutional under the State constitution or

3

under the Federal Constitution?

4

A

Under the State and Federal Constitution.

5

Q

That is the Patton case?

A

Yes.

7

Q

Yes.

A

That is not

19

sentence.
They found no violation of the man's Constitutional

25

as a matter

right.
Q

Is there any indication at all in this record

as to why the second-sentencing judge imposed a greater sentencel
A

I think the only indication is that the second-

sentencing judge intended to impose the maximum, the 15-years.
17

Q

1

We know what he did„ what he intended to do,

2

and what effect it had.

3

as to why?

My question was is there any indication

4

A

No , there is not.

5

Q

Do you think that in the absence of any indicatio

6

that this-presumption of judicial good will and good faith

7

can prevail when there is no indication at all of any reason

3

whatsoever to impose a harsher sentence after the socond trial?
A

9
10

I think it should.

I think the burden should

be upon the defendant to show.

11

Q

How could he possibly show?

12

Well, it depends upon the disparity between the

13

two sentences that were imposed.

punishment was

That is not in issue here.

17

A

That is correct.

18

My argument would be that rather than adopt the flat

19

prohibition set forth in Patton, if the Court will not have

20

the opinion that the burden was on the defendant to show abuse,

21

Q

Mr. Vanore,

additional evidence is shown

is it not true that in Worth

Carolina that one® a sentence is given in a final judgment the

2

judge can never increase that, can he?

3

A

That is correct»

4

Q

But if there is an appeal that comes back to him,

S

he can increase? is that correct?

6

A

If a new trial is ordered, that is correct.

7

Q

What happens to all of this judicial faith in

8

the judge?

Wouldn't he be obliged to show why on the second

9

go-around he gave more?

10

A

11

Q

That is the only

12

trial judge had some good

reason in imposing a harsher sentence.

14

Q

Wouldn't it be better if he gave his reasons?

15

A

I think definitely he should give his reasons.

16

Q

But I thought you said that the defendant should

17
18

19
20
21

22

24
25

be given the burden of showing it.
A

Well, I ---

Q

You were on this

burden business.

A

The Supreme Court of --

Q

You agree with me that the judge has got a

little burden.
A

The Supreme Court of North Carolina in a very

recent decision, State versus Stafford, which is cited in the
State's brief, stated that the burden should be upon the
19

1

defendant to show abuse.
However, it would foe more orderly if thejre was

2
3

evidence or if the judge stated his reasons into the record

4

as to why an increased sentence was given.
The main contention that we have here is that the

5
6

flat prohibition laid down in

the Patton case that you can

7

never, no matter what the evidence is at the second trial, you

8

can never exceed the sentence imposed at the first trial.
We think that that is a flagrantviolation of the

9
10

discretion of the trial judge to impose a proper sentence, and

1 1

the discretion of the State Legislature to fix a punishment

2

for a particular crime.
Q

3

What I am saying is, if a man committed a crime

4

and he is sentenced to five to 15 years and after that time

5

the judge finds out through reputable sources that this is

There is nothing he can do about it unless

That is correct.

ARGUMENT OF LARRY B. SITTON, ESQ.

My name is Larry Sitton.

1 1

A,

I am from Greensboro, North

I represent the respondent in this case, Clifton

Pearce.
At the outset I might say that

12

I think Mr. Vanore

13

has made clear that in this particular case at the second

14

trial the judge gave Mr. Pearce credit for the time he had

15

served under his first sentence, and deducted that amount to

16

1
\
fix the eight-year sentence and that this credit would not have

17

been made on the second sentence.

18
19

to serve and in my brief that is the reason I said it out as
I did.
In North Carolina the computation of good conduct time

But if you

measured the person^ sentence as if he had served it straight
through.

In other words, his minimum sentence on his first

conviction was 12 years and this was in 1961.
If he had served it straight through he would have

22

1

been released in 1973.

The second sentence was for eight years

and this was in 1966.

If he served it straight through he would

That is right.

There would be no problem,

sentence.

5

What he did

6

do caused the man to serve more time than he would have served

7

if he had had just the 15-year term originally.

8

A

That is correct.

9

Q

So all we are talking about is whether a judge

10

can give a greater sentence on the second one than the first

11

one.

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

A

That is correct.

Q

And you both agree that under this sentence

that he did get on the second proceeding he must serve more
time than he would have on the first.
A

That is right.

Q

That is the basic question, isn't it, whether

he can do that?
A

That is right.

In this case the decision of the District Court was
affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on the basis
of Patton versus North Carolina.

That case thoroughly explored

the Constitutional issues involved in whether you can have
an increased sentence.
It said that an increased sentence on retrial violated
25

1

three portions of the Constitution:

2

Protection clauses of the 14th Amendment and the Double Jeopardy

3

clause of the 5th Amendment.

4

The Due Process and Equal

Nov/, in due process the State should not be allowed

5

or requir the defendants to waive a benefit conferred by the

6

State in order to assert his Constitutional right.

7

Now, the benefit is immunity from increased sentence —

8

has already bean pointed out that after the term of Court has

0

expired and the sentence has begun to be served, it cannot be

10

11

increased in North Carolina.
Yes, the only way that this is possible is for a

12

person to assert his right to a fair trial through some method

13

of the first-conviction review.

14

his right to a fair trial, saying that there is a Constitutional

15

defect in his first trial, then hts runs the risk of getting an

IS

increased sentence.

17

If he does this, if he asserts

If he had not sought a fair trial, he would have

18

been assured that the time he had served would be credited

19

and that he would become eligible for parole in due course.

20

But he didn't do this in this case.

21

Constitutional defect in his first trial and this was borne

He said that there was a

recommending it but he said that would be a way to ——
A

I think so, and in North Carolina because they

have this credit rule it would be a way to get around it but
this again goes into the function of the sentencing judge.
Q

What if instead of the judge having discretion

as to the sentence to be imposed within statutory limits, what
if this were a matter for the jury to determine as is,in fact,
true in many States, as you know?

Would the jury under your

submission on the second trial have to be told that while
ordinarily the statute gives the juries in our State power to
impose sentence upon conviction for this type of offense any­
where from probation up to 20 years in the

penitentiary while

normally that is the power given to a jury.
Yet in this case this man has been tried before and
he was sentenced by a previous jury to 12 years and, therefore,
you cannot in this case, if you convict this man, sentence him
to more than 12 years.

That would be the result, 1 suppose, of

your submission.
Now, wouldn't that pretty well prejudice this hypo­
thetical defendant before a jury to have the jury told that he
has been convicted before and sentenced to 12 years in peniten­
tiary for this same offense?
A

I think that if it was a problem of prejudice in

25

27

1

bringing out the first conviction,, I think

2

in such a situation that the jury would be allowed to set the

3

sentence and then it would ba reduced to bring it in line with

4

this rule* if that was the problem.

5

1 think

6

Q

the rule should be

The other answer, 1 suppose, would be that in

7

the instructions the judge could say that you are limited to

8

sentencing him upon conviction from probation to 12 years with­

9

out giving

10

the explanation as to why.

A

Whether the jury sentences him or the judge

*

It

sentences him the risk is still the same for the defendant

12

for asserting his Constitutional right.
Q

13
14
15
16
17

Well, the risk is the same for the defendant

for asserting his Constitutional right but if he prevails on
appeal then the conventional theory is that the original trial
is wiped out and he goes to trial again and he has a very good
opportunity of being acquitted.

18

A

That is true, Your Honor.

Q

And your submission would result in a heads, I

A

21

22

24
25

Well, if he was reconvicted though, if he was

not acquitted then he would still, even under this rule, he
would still go back to prison or could conceivably go back to
prison to serve out what he would have had under the original
sentence.

He does not. walk out because of this rule.

an entirely different kind of character than the

A

8
9

I don’t think the rule should be any different,

Your Honor, for the simple reason that if it is possible under

10

any circumstances to increase the sentence because of additional:

11

evidence or because of information in the pre-sentence report,

12

then the danger still remains that the person could be penalised

13

for

asserting his Constitutional right.

That is

On the equal protection argument, we come back to

17

the same point again that the person’s sentence can’t be

increased after he begins serving so that the only class of

19

persons exposed to the risk of increased sentence are those

20

who exercise their right of appeal.
We submit that this is an arbitrary^classification,

21

22

that there is no reason to believe that only the class of

23

persons who have won a new trial should receive any harsher

sentence.

25

Q

Mr. Sitton, how far does your argument go —
30

1

perhaps I shouldn’t ask you this.

You are from North

2

Carolina.

3

and the rule is in North Carolina as a matter of State law

4

that a person sentenced after second conviction has to be given

5

credit for the time served on his first conviction, as a

6

matter of State law.

You are representing a North Carolina petitioner

And that the total of that prior time plus the new

7

8

sentence cannot exceed the statutory maximum, as 1 understand.

9

But now there are States where there is no such rule or State

law.
Would your argument be that ~~ take this case -- a
man is convicted by a jury and sentenced by the judge to five
years in the penitentiary.

He serves two years of it, then

he gets his conviction set aside and goes back for a new trial.
He is convicted again by the jury.
Mow, how much time in the penitentiary can the judge
sentence him to, five years?
A

No, sir.

Q

Why not?

That would be the same sentence he

got the first time.
A

Yet

he has already spent two years of his

life in prison.
Q

So you say the State rule in North Carolina is

also a rule required by the Federal Constitution?
A

Yes, sir, Your Honor.
31
i

25

That is right, Your Honor.

I think even if the

State did not have the rule as North Carolina does it would
still be unconstitutional .

What would you say about giving credit for the

time he is out on bail?
A

Do you have to give credit for that?

I don't think I would go that far.

in this case, of course.

Wo, sir.

3

Q

There are some cases that say it isn't?

9

A

That is right, Your Honor.

10

Q

In this Court.

1 1

A

I think that those cases that you make reference

1:2

to Stroud and to Murphy versus Massachusetts -- that was a

13

factual reality that there was an increased sentence in both

14

cases, but I don’t think the Court faced that issue.

15

16
17

I think in both of those cases that the argument
was made that the second trial itself was barred.
Q

We have held that the man in the first trial

18

gets life and after the second trial, after an appeal, gets

19

death, as double jeopardy.

20

A

I think that was the fact in Stroud.

21

Q

That was the Green case, wasn’t it?

A

I think in Green he was convicted acquitted of

22
23
24
25

first degree murder, convicted of second degree murder and at
a subsequent trial was convicted of first degree murder and
this Court said that the conviction of second degree murder at

7

the Court, that the second trial after a successful appeal is

8

not in and of itself a violation of double jeopardy?
A

9

That is right, Your Honor.

I think that was

10

the sole issue that we brought forward.

11

arguments that were made in this case were not made in Stroud.

12

They were made in Green to some extent and in Green it. was

do you suppose that Stroud would have been any more successful
