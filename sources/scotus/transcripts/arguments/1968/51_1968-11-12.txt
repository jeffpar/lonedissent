ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

8
9

MR. LACOVARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court, this case which is here on direct appeal from the

10

United States District Court for the Eastern District of

11

Pennsylvania arose out of the efforts to uncover and prosecute

12

the members of a multi-state ring which specializes in extortino

13

money from victims upon threat to accuse them of homosexual

14

activities.
The indictments in the present case we re returned

15
16

under a Federal interstate racketeering statute, the so-called

17

Travel Act, Section 1952 of the Federal Criminal Code, which

18

makes it a Federal offense to travel in Interstate Commerce

19

with the intent to carry on unlawful activity, including

20

extortion in violation of the laws of the state in which

21

committed, and thereafter to perform an act promoting that

22

objective.

23

The indictments in the present case were on appellee's

24

motion to dismiss by the District Court.

25

in using the term "extortion” Congress intended that the term

2

The court found first

J

should track closely the legal understanding of that term under

2 , state law, but that in Pennsylvania the crime captioned
,

3

i

"extortion" is the common law form of extortion, that is the

4

crime committed by a public officer who takes an unauthorised

S

or excessive fee, and that since the appellees had not been

6

alleged to be public officers and in fact were conceded not to

7

be, the indictment failed, to state an offense against them.

.

The Government's contention is that this statute uses

0
9

the term "extortion" and the other terms that are listed in

10

the statute generically, so that conduct has referred to a sort

11

of criminal activity, and that interstate travel to promote

12

this type of act is reached by the Federal statute so long as

13

the conduct is made unlawful by the law of the state, whatever

14

the particular label the state happens to attach to it.

15

The issue before the court this morning is whether

16

the Government's construction rather than the District Court

17

is the correct one.

18

i

The Travel Act which was enacted in 1361 as part of

19

a series of measures to combat organized crime and racketeering

20

makes it a general offense, and provides generally that inter­

21

state travel to promote an unlawful activity as subsequently

22

defined is a Federal violation.

23

Unlawful activity could be in violation of the law

24

of the state or of the United States, and for relevant purposes

25

the statute makes it a Federal violation to travel in
3

1

Interstate Commerce to carry on extortion in violation of the

2

laws of a particular state.

3

The allegations in the present indictments allege

4

that at least one of the conspirators travels in Interstate

5

Commerce from Chicago to Philadelphia in two cases, and from

6

Camden, New Jersey, to Philadelphia, in a third, with the in­

7

tent to promote an activity unlawful under Pennsylvania law.
The controversy in this case arises from the fact

0
9

that under Pennsylvania law extortionate conduct is termed

10

"blackmail" rather than "extortion," but Pennsylvania does

1?

have as I mentioned the continuation of the original ancient

12

common law notion of extortion, the acceptance by a public

13

officer of unlawful fees.

14

The District Court on its analysis of the language of

15

the statute and its legislative history concluded that Congress

10

intended when it spoke of extortion and violation of the laws

17

of the State in which committed, that the Federal term should

IS

track closely the legal understanding of that term in State law,
We contend that this construction of the statute

19

20

deserves the remedial part of this legislation an insupportable

21

narrows its plain meaning.
I should like to turn first to the background and

22
23

purpose of the statute.

24

series of measures submitted by the Department of Justice in

25

1961 to

bring

I mentioned that this was one of a

Federal resources and Federal criminal process

4

t

to bear on a problem which had outgrown the capacity of State

2

and local Governments to deal with, and that is the situation

3

which we have encountered through the ability of the modern

4

organized syndicate criminal that conducts illegal operations

5

from a remote State, sending minions back and forth across

6

State lines to carry out various forms of illicit activity,

7

using long distance telephone to manage or carry out various

8

forms of violations of State law.

9

This mobility, and this diffusion of organization,

10

made it extremely difficult for State and local authorities to

11

investigate or to prosecute violations of their local laws.

12

Now, the statute, as it is clear both from its

13

language and its legislative history, does not purport to close

14

off the channels of Interstate Commerce to all attempts to

15

violate State lawB

16

racketeering.

17

Because its focus was organised crime and

The organization of communication from one State to

18

another were to be interrupted for those who travel in Commerce

19

with unlawful activities, only with respect to activities

20

which years of investigation by State and local crime commis­

21

sions, and by the Federal Government and by congressional

22

committees had shown to be the mainstays of organized crime,

23

and for that reason the term "unlawful activity" in the Travel

24

Act is defined to include only business enterprises involving

25

gambling, prostitution, liquor, and narcotics violations, and
5

1

extortion, bribery, and arson in violation of State or Federal

2

law.

3

These were the activities that these investigations
»
I;

4

had established to be the principal occupations of the organ­

S

ised modern nation-wide criminal operations.

6

The question before the court is what Congress in­

7

tended to reach by using the term "extortion" in violation of

8

the laws of the State in which committed.

9

has held that in Pennsylvania, and therefore as it recognized

'10

in at least 12 other States which also do not condemn extor­

11

tionate activities under the heading of extortion, but instead

12

maintain some continuation of the common law notion of extor­

13

tion — that this Federal statute reaches only travel in

14

Interstate Commerce into a State by a public official of that

15

State to accept an unauthorized fee.

16

The District Court

It is our contention that this narrow construction
I

17

by the District Court is plainly in error.

18

was not one of the principal forms of violations that motivated

19

Congress to pass this Federal legislation dealing with Inter-

Abuse of office

i

20

state travel to promote extortion.

?J

There are several reasons that make that clear.

22

First, it is unlikely that a public official of a

?

23

State is going to be a member of an organized criminal syndicate,

24

but in any event his opportunity in the District Court’s

25

analysis to commit extortion in the common law sense derives
6

%

from his position as a public officer V7ithin the State, and

2

therefore he is not the type of individual who is unlikely to

3

be ameniable to investigation and prosecution by the local

4

authorities.

5

Q

i
,
In reading the briefs in this case, I was im­

6

pressed, negatively impressed, by the seeming lack of legis­

7

lative history bearing very explicitly on this question.

8

assume that there is none; is that correct?

9
30

A

I

That is correct.

The Senate and House hearings do not reveal any

II

specific focus on the question of what extortion meant.

How­

12

ever, I think it is significant that in the course of wending

13

its way through Congress, this bill was sought to be amended

14

by the House in a way which I think will illustrate the actual

35

intent and focus that Congress had in using the term "extortion.”

16

As I mentioned, the unlawful activities are defined

17

to mean for illegal business operations as well as extortion,

38

bribery and arson.

19

by the Full House, tried to limit extortion and bribery to

20

offenses committed in connection with the illegal businesses

21

otherwise defined in the statute.

22

The House committee, subsequently ratified

The Department of Justice vigorously objected, the

23

Department of Justice had sponsored the measure, to that amendment

24

and wrote to Chairman Celler of the House committee that this

25

amendment would eliminate from the purview of the statute
7

1

extortions which were unrelated to the other business enter­

2

prises mentioned in the statute, but which were and had

3

historically been major forms of extortion petpetrated by

4

organized crime.
This letter from the Justice Department explicitly

3
6

mentioned that such forms of extortion practiced by organized

7

crime includes shakedown rackets, Shylocking or the charging

8

of usury interest on loans and labor extortion.

9

Q

Where is that?

10

A

It is not in the brief.

11

Q

12

A

Is it in the record?
No, this case arises on dismissal of an indict­

13

ment and there is no record.

It is quoted in a law review

14

article which we cite, the Palmer Article in Volume 28 of the

15

Brooklyn Law Review.
Apparently it was not published as part of the

16
17

hearings or the committee reports, because it was submitted

18

after the reports had been printed by the various committees.
All that we have is the conference report which

19

20

merely states the. conclusion that the Senate had agreed to

21

the House.

22
23

24
25

Q

The only record you have of this letter is in

a law review?
A

It was written by an attorney of the Department

of Justice, I realise that may seem self-serving, but we have
8

1

no reason to doubt his good faith, but that is the only place»

2

Q

Where did he get the letter?

3

A

Apparently he wrote it.

4

Q

If you want to use a letter like that, you must

5

find it in the Department files.
A

Q

7

submit it if the court wishes to see the full text of the letter
Q

8

9

I am sure that we can obtain a copy of it and

If you want us to look at any of it, I think

that you would furnish the whole letter.
A

10

Very fine, I will make arrangements to do that.

If

But it was in that context that the conference committees

12

deleted the limiting language, and restored the bill to its

13

fuller scope.

We don't realize solely on that one isolated

and perhaps not terribly accessible piece of legislative
history.
Our basic argument, as we went into in great length
in the brief, is that the background of the legislation shows
that we are dealing with the types of activity engaged in by
organized crime syndicates, and public officer actions are
not a principal form of this activity.
The other terms used in the statute also are clearly
used in their generic sense.

The term "gambling” or "narcotics

violations" clearly as the hearings themself will show, does
not point only to a section of a State law which is captioned
"gambling," or "narcotic violations."

9

This is an effort by

1

Congress to refer us to categories of crime, which if made

unlawful by the State where the activity is going to be

Q

Wow extortion is linked here with bribery, and

bribery involves bv definition public officers, doesn’t it?
A

Yes.

That I think underscores the soundness of

7

our position, because under the District Court's approach the

Q

use of those two terms side by side in this statute would make

9

one of them superfluous in at least a third to a quarter of

AFTERNOON SESSION

2
3

12:35 p.m.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Lacovara, you may

4 : continue your argument.
5

MR. LACOVARA:

6

I would like to resume by returning to the point

7

that Mr. Justice Stewart raised in his question noting the

8

relative sparseness of the legislative history on the question

9

of what Congress understood by the term 'extortion.''

10

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I began to respond to the question by suggesting that
: since Congress dealt in the clause in which It uses the term

12

extortion, with another offense which it termed bribery, that

13

the District Court’s analysis would in Pennsylvania and about

14

at least seven, and perhaps many more States, make one or the

15

other of these two terms redundant, because in Pennsylvania

16

the crime captioned extortion is simply a form of bribery.

17

18

That I think is not the limit of the fair inferences
that can be drawn from the legislative history.

19

I mentioned earlier that this legislation was con­

20

sidered along with a package of other measures that had been

21

submitted in 1961 to deal with the subject of organized crime.

22

There were two other statutes which were submitted

23

and being considered by Congress at the very same time the

24

hearings in both the house and Senate were held on a series of

25

measures, and two of the bills that were before Congress at the
11

1

time used the term extortion in the sense that we suggest

2

Congress understood it in passage of the Travel Act.
The first was a measure to amend and expand the

3
4

Fugitive Felon Act which at the time was limited only to those

5

who had fled from states to avoid prosecution of certain defined

6

felonies, certain enumerated felonies, one of which was

7

extortion by threat of violence.
Another one of the measures Congress was considering

8
9

at the very time it had the Travel Act before it was a proposal

10

to provide for a grant of immunity in situations where there

11

was an arguable violation of either the Labor Management

12

Relations Act or the Hobbs Act which punished opposite sides of

13

the same coin.

14

The Hobbs Act punishes extortion, presumably covering

15

labor extortion, and the 1947 Labor Act makes it an offense for

18

an employer to give money or a thing of value to a union official

17

apart from his wages.
So that there was before Congress at the time it was

18
19

considering the Travel Act two pieces of legislation which used

20

the term extortion in the precise generic sense of a coercive

21

exaction under threat of force or accusation that had been used

22

to underlie the earlier measures.

23
24
25

Q

Am 1 correct in my belief that no where in the statutes

under consideration did Congress use the word ’'blackmail"?
A

That is correct, sir.
12

That is the source of the

'i

difficulty.

2

that blackmail has for a hundred years or more been considered

3

a synonym for extortion, and indeed the Pennsylvania courts and

4

Pennsylvania Legislature used these terms Interchangeably in

5

cases which the District Court saw fit to reject as ill con-

6

sidered.

7

ments drawn under the blackmail statutes alleged In the instant

8

indictments even though those indictments In the state court

.9

charged extortion by henious crime.

10
11

12

Q

We have suggested on a related alternative argument

The Pennsylvania courts have in fact sustained Indict­

Have you made any study to determine how many states

consider the facts in this case as being extortion?
A

Yes.

In our appendix to our brief, Mr. Chief Justice,

13

we set forth that there are at least thirteen states which

14

punish this form of conduct under a blackmail statute.
In at least seven of those states, extortion Is a

IS
16

separately defined offense, but it relates to the common law

17

form of extortion.
We also set forth that there are other classifications

18
19

of extortion conducted in other states, robbery, threats and

20

menaces.

21

is a crime expressly called extortion.

22

to the public officer exaction or some particular notion of

23

extortion.

24

25

In a number of those other states, similarly, there
That does relate either

In five or six states the only offense called
extortion is charging by a railroad company of unfair carrier
13

I

and presumably under the District Court mechanical analysis

2

the only offenses which would be reached by the Travel Act in

3

those States would be submission by mail ©f a bill by a railroad

4

company of an inflated charge.
That is not in any way related to the organized

5
8

crime focus on this measure.

7

8

We did not collect in our appendix all of the possible
permutations of relating the categorization of the statutes.
You will notice, Mr. Chief Justice, that the last

3

' ;

i

io

category on pages 30 and 31 of our Breif lists statutes which

ii

make some mention in their caption of extortion.

12

are, however, hybrids like fear used to extort or larceny by

13

extortion,

14

Some of them

In some of those states there is a crime captioned

IS

simply extortion which is the public officer exaction.

16

the District Court would deal with these we can't imagine.

17

this confirms, we believe, we should be looking not to labels

18

but to substance in interpreting this statute.

13

How
But

The focus of the Congressional concern in this area

20

with the type of activity which years of investigation have

21

shown organized crime syndicates customarily resorted to in

22

mulching their profits.

23

has yet suggested, not even the District Court, that acceptance

24

of unlawful fees is a traditional form of organized crime.

23

Vie consider rather that Congress used the term extortion as it

They had not been shown and no one

14

i

1

used the other terms in this statute in its generic sense as

2

relating to a category of possible unlawful conduct, an attempt

3

to obtain money or property from an individual by threat, either

4

to commit injury upon him or his family or his property, or to

S

obtain some advantage or to accuse him of a heinous crime or

6

some other indictable offense.
The District Court supported its analysis by pointing

7

8
9
10

:,o

the language of the statute and to the undisputed Congressional

policy of respecting the variations in state criminal lav/
definitions.
Neither of these factors, however, supports the

11

12

District Court analysis.
First, the language of the statute does not even say

13
14

that it is an offense to travel in interstate commerce to

15

engage in activity in violation of extortion laws of the state.
We might have a somewhat graver problem In accepting

16
17

the Government’s construction if that were the usage, but we

18

have instead an act which punishes Interstate commerce to pro­

19

mote extortion in violation of the lav/s of the state in which

20

committed.

j

21

We suggest that this Is quite susceptible and of

22

the construction that is in fact the intended construction

23

meaning Congress was concerned about a category of activity,

24

and so long as that activity, that type of activity is actually

25

made unlawful under the laws of the state in which the activity
15

1
2

is committed it's reached by this federal statute.
Similarlya the Congressional awareness that the

3

contours of criminal activity will vary from state to state,

4

even within a particular type of activity, in no way suggests

E

that the label of the particular state happens to affix in

6

outlawing some form of that activity should rigidly control the

7

interpretation of the federal statute.

6

9

The exchanges in the legislative history relied on
by the District Court related to gambling.

It was expressly

10

recognized that for several reasons an individual who operated

11

a lawful gambling business in Nevada would not be in violation

12

of this statute if he traveled to promote that activity.

13

Now, the District Courts somewhat extrapulated from,

14

that that Congress intended that the definition of the term

15

used in the federal statute should track closely their legal

16

understanding under state law.

17

supports that.

18

witnesses testifying indicated that whether or not the gambler,

19

the Los Vegas gambler travel was unlawful, was going to turn on

20

whether or not his activities were dealt with under a statute

21

talking of gambling.

22

The cited passage in no xiray

No one either on the Committee or any of the

It was assumed throughout the legislative history

23

that even If the state had a statute outlawing a lottery under

24

a statute of gambling and outlawed bookmaking separately under

25

a statute entitled bookmaking, a bookmaker who traveled in
16

interstate commerce would still be in violation of this statute.

1

2

,

3
4

5

Q

Is this the first time this question has arisen in

the District Court?
A

Yes.

There have been other prosecutions under the

extortion branch of this statute, including some for extortion

6 j conduct engaged in in states which punish only blackmail, punish
?

a crime called blackmail, and which have instead under the

8

heading extortion public officer exaction cases.
There is a reported decision to that effect in

9
10

United States versus Hughes, 385 Federal Second, where the

11

extortion was conducted in North Carolina, which is one of the

12

states listed in our blackmail list and which also has an

13

extortion statute similar to that in Pennsylvania.
There was no challenge in that statute to the

!4

IS

reach of the extortion terra in this legislation.

16

Q

When was that passed?

17

A

That Act was passed in 1961,

This Is another argument,

18

we believe, supports our construction, even though coneedlngly

19

the legislative history is not expressed on the question of how

20

Congress defined or understood the term.

21

When Congress legislates on a criminal subject in the

22

1960's we think it highly desirable that it be taken to be

23

using terms in their commonplace every day sense, because it is

24

this sense in which the average man of ordinary intelligence,

25

who must gauge his conduct by the measure, should be held to
17

understand it

1
2

As nre have seen recently, the Federal legislation as

3

well as the Pennsylvania judicial and legislative treatment and

4

the scholarly opinions cited in our Brief, all illustrate that

3

today In the i9601s extortion does not mean an exaction by a

6

public official.
The mere acceptance of an unauthorized fee, even in

1
8

the absence of any coercion, it means rather an attempt to

9

obtain something of value from the individual by making it a

JO

threat to do some injury to him or to his reputation,

11

Q

12

Does it not make the statute rather vague, if you do

not confine It to the crime which is named?
A

13

No, not necessarily.

If we look at the Pennsylvania

14

law to see what the man of ordinary intelligence in Pennsylvania

loan sharking as extortion, the statute with the label extortion

wouldn't have any problem?

That is right.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA* ESQ.

MR. LACOVARA:

Mr* Justice White* I am not sure what

I

rJBB

i Hi

13

the result of the colloquy was between counsel and you on the

14

question of possible effect of re-labeling or separating out

15

provisions that at one time were called extortion., but on page

16

22 of our Brief I would like to call your attention to up to

17

1939 the homosexual extortion conduct presently termed blackmail?

18

was In fact called extortion by threats to accusa of an infamous

19

crime.

;

20

Mr. Chief Justice* you also mentioned an anomaly that

21

would be caused by accepting the appellee’s position, that is*

22

this statute would not apply to conduct unlawful In Pennsylvania

23

but would apply to conduct unlawful In California* simply

24

because of the difference in the labels atop the statutes.

25

We needn’t speculate about that.
42

There is presently

j

1

before the Court on petition for writ ofcertiorari the case of

2

Pine vs. United States* number 507* which does involve the

Of

identical type of homosexual extortion scheme involved here,

4

but there the gang members went from Chicago west to Utah which

5

caused the conduct to be extortion, rather than east to

3

Pennsylvania.

7

We submit there is no reason for thinking Congress

8

didn't wish to reach both types of conduct unlawful under state

9

law and the Order- of the District Court should be reversed.

concluded.)
