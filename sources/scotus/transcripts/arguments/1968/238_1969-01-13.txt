ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B„ M.cKAY, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. McKAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Courts

9

plaintiff, appellant in this case, who, through the generosity

10

of the Clerk's office, has been allowed to participate with me

11

as an adviser, even though he is not a member of this Bar or

12

of any Bar, but he is a man of great knowledge in the field of

13

Congressional districting, particularly in New York.

I should like to first introduce Mr. David Wells, the

14

This is an appeal from a 3-judge Federal District

IS

Court in the Southern District of New York dismissing the suit

16

that had been brought by Mr. Wells in 1966 in challenging the

17

then 1961 Congressional districting statute in New York.
The present appeal is from the judgment and order of

18

19

1968 upholding and, therefore, dismissing the complaint in

20

connection with the l.S68iCongressional districting statute of

21

New York.

22

In a sense, this case picks up where the Missouri

23

case, on which we have just heard argument, leaves off,

24

many respects it is quite different because in this case, un­

25

like the Missouri case, the legislative posture was totally
3

In

1

different.

There was no debate in the Legislature of any

2

consequence.

3

prepared by a Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment

4

en camera and it was presented and passed without essential

S

debate.

There was only one plan presented,, which had been

6

Population disparities between the smallest and the

7

largest districts are more than twice as great as in the Mis­

8

souri case, and specifically in this case, the appellant has

9

claimed throughout that there is a deviation that is so sub­

10

stantial it requires justification, but the justifications

11

given by the State are unsatisfactory and, further, that there

M

is a lack of compactness and that the reasons for that are ex­

13

plained. by affirmative evidence in the record showing that there:

14

was a partisan objective leading to the particular district

15

lines that were drawn.

16

This case, thus, raises two principal questions that

17

are related but separable.

18

deviations that are not de minimis, what is necessary for the

19

State in order to satisfy the burden of justification.

20

The first is whether population

Second, where the districts are not as compact as

21

they could have been, and there is affirmative evidence of a

22

gerrymander for partisan, or in this case perhaps bipartisan

23

purposes, is the plan unconstitutional?

24
25

The suit was originally filed in 1956 in challenge
to the last previous Congressional districting statute in New

4

31

York which dated from the year 196.1«

2

judge court held that the statute was unconstitutional and that

3

decision was affirmed by this Court in December of 1967.

In May of 1967, the 3-

The 3-judge court held that the population deviations

S

were excessive, and they were, indeed, very substantial at that

6

time.

7

seemingly bizarre structure among the Congressional Districts,"

8

and so the court advised that in redrawing the line, the Legis­

9

lature should draw Congressional Districts that are, and I

10
11

They suggested also that there was, and I quote, i!a

quote, "reasonably compact and contiguous."
The Legislature was warned not to allow, and I quote,

12

"considerations of race, sex, economic status, or politics to

13

cross their minds.How well the New York Legislature obeyed

14

that injunction, we shall see.

15

The 1968 Act was prepared by a small group of legis­

16

lators in a Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment and

17

the drafting was largely in the hands of advisers to the lead­

18

ing Republican and Democratic figures concerned with this par­

19

ticular matter at the time in the State of New York.

20

The plan was introduced on February 20th, in response

21

to a determination by the 3-judge District Court that a new

22

plan must be drafted and presented by March 1st of 1968.

23

was discussed briefly, but not really debated, and both Houses

24

of the New York Legislature on February 26th, passed after a

25

10-minute debate in the Senate and a slightly longer but

perfunctory debate in the Assembly.

There were substantial majorities for the legislation

in both Houses and by both parties in each House.

real doubt as to the decision made in advance that this was the

7

legislation that would be accepted by the New York Legislature

3

in 1968.

9

There was no

The principles ef Congressional districting that have

10

been outlined by this Court, or that are, we believe, in the

11

prospect of being defined, are several.

12

population equality is required.

First, substantial

13

Second, to the extent that there is comparison with

14

State legislative reapportionment, the deviations of Congres­

15

sional Districts: should be and ordinarily will be smaller than

16

in State legislative redistricting.

17

Third, the deviations must be explained on rational

18

and permissible grounds, and now it seems to us that there are

19

emerging principles which will be tested in part by this case.

20

The deviations from compactness also must be explained by the

2,1

22

egislative body or those who support the legislation.
Q

I am not sure I understood your second criterion

23

That is, as I heard you say it, smaller deviations are required

24

in Congressional districting than might be permitted in State

23

legislative reapporti©mnenfc.

Did I understand that correctly?
6

I

A

Yes, sir»

In Reynolds versus Sims,, the majority

2

opinion stated that there might be a larger toleration for

3

deviations in State legislative representation districts than

4

in Congressional, because ordinarily there are a larger number

5

of districts to be drawn in a State legislative chamber than in

6

the Congressional Districts,,

7

Q

I thought that worked the other way „

8

A

No, I think not, because of the necessity of the

9

opportunity to draw so many different districts, there is more

10

opportunity to play with the population figures, the point, in

11

a sense, that Mr» Achtenberg made in connection with Missouri»

12

Q

Smaller building blocks»

13

A

Smaller building blocks, and more of them? yes,

Q

So it follows, in your submission, that a lower

14

IS

sir.

16

magnitude of deviation is constitutionally permissible in Con­

M

gressional Districts than might be constitutionally tolerable

?8

in State legislative apportionments.

19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

And you say there is something in Reynolds

21

against Sims that says so?

22

A

Yes, there is.

I can find the specific

23

Q

Well, it is probably in your brief.

24

A

It is in the brief; yes, sir.

25

Q

Thank you.
7

t

A

The emerging principles, as we see them , are that

z

when there are deviations from compactness, that this also must

3

be explained by the State because it is impossible to have

4

equality without being tested, in a sense at least, by the

3

measure of compactness, a point I shall return to»

6

Finally, we suggest that a gerrymander for racial,

7

religious, socio-economic or partisan purposes is or should be

8

forbidden by the Constitution*

S

Let me speak first to the question of deviations in

10

©quality a3 it affects this case»

11

the deviations in this case are not de minimis by any standard

12

whatsoever»

13

Congressional District in the State of New York under the 1958

'14

Act is more than 53,000 parsons»

15

It seems to us manifest that

The deviation from the smallest to the largest

This is a difference in percentage point from the

16

smallest, the least populous, to the most populous district, of

17

over 14 percent.

18

lation deviations as great as 50,000 where it would have been

19

perfectly possible to reduce the figure, as I shall suggest

20

later, to a very small figure, indeed.

21

22
23
24
25

Even adjoining districts sometimes have popu­

Indeed, it would have been possible to change one of
the substantial deviations between adjoining districts from
40,000-plus to 5,000~plus by the shift of a single county, and
now if you will refer, I can show you where this is, to Appendix
B — yes, I can do it on the map that is behind me, as well»
8

It!

1
2

is also in Appendix B in the appellant's brief.
Lewis County, which is now in the 31st District, could

3

have been shifted to the 32nd District, thus also increasing or

4

improving compactness of the 32nd District, with a difference

5

in population instead of 40,000-plus, of 5,000-plus.

u

to

If a further shift had been made of Hamilton County,

7

which is here, to the 32nd District, the population deviation

8

would have been reduced to under 2,000.

9

case there would have been some sacrifice of compactness and we

But in that particular

10

do not urge it but simply point out that this would have been

u

possible without any other change in the State lines in that

12

particular area.

13

On the deviation from equality point, it should be

14

noted that there is no decision of this Court %hat has approved

15

a population deviation as large as the one that exists in the

16

State of Mew York now.

17

case already discussed, the only two eases in which this Court

18

has recently affirmed a decision with a population deviation of

19

any substantial figure have been in the Mississippi and the

20

Florida cases, and in neither of those was the population devia­

21

tion as large as in the New York case.

22
23
24
25

Q

As has bean made clear from the Missouri:

What do you think the deviation was in the

Florida case?
A

The Legislature thought it was 8,000-plus.

the actual figures were made available, it turned out to be

When

1

'IS^OGO-pluSo

Now, I do not make any particular —

2

Q

WasnBt that a court-made plan?

3

A

Yes, that is correct, sir.

4

Q

And the court thought it was only a deviation of

5

a total of something like 2 percent, didnst it?

6

A

that is correct.

7

Q

And you say when the figures became available,

9

A

It turned out to be something like 48 <,000.

10

Q

But the court, in affirming here, did it have the

8

it was ~

figures then, or not?
12

Or did it have only what the District

Court had?
A

3

I think this Court at the time had the figures

4

of 48,000, but I would have to verify that.

5

I will let you know.
Q

6
17

If that is wrong,

Because that would have made a total variation

of something like

2 percent.

8

A

Yes, from the smallest to the largest.

19

Q

Yes, and what is the total variation in this

24

25

case --

4?
A

Over

4 percent.

Q

What do you think is th© right approach — from

the smallest to the largest, or deviation from the ideal, whethe:
plus or minus?
A

Both are available.

0

If you want the deviations

j

s

from the ideal, the figure in this ease would be 6„6 in one

2

direction and 6.5 in the other direction.

•o
w

figure, of course, is the deviation

4

s

Q

But the more dramatic

Well, naturally it is more dramatic, but X

wonder which is the more helpful,

6

A

I think they are both relevant and I would be

7

glad to stand on either of them as showing a very substantial

S

impermissible deviation in this case.
My present point is only that it is not ds minimis

9
10

and that, thus, under Swann versus Adams, and other decisions

11

in this Court and elsewhere, it becomes necessary for the State

12

to explain what the reasons for those deviations were, it is

13

here that I believe the State has failed to give any satisfacfcorjf

14

explanation.

j

No explanation will hold up at all.

Let me talk then briefly to the explanations that the

15
16

State has sought to give and suggest why X think each of them

17

is inadequate and not sufficient constitutionally.
The State asserts in the first place that the plan

18
19

took into account regional differences throughout the State of

20

New York.

21

difficulty is that the plan is not consistent in that standard.

22

There are substantial unexplained departures from the notion of

23

regionality or from the notion that they also assert of the

24

desirability of preserving political subdivision lines, counties),

25

cities, and towns, where possible.

This would obviously be of some significance.

1.1

Let me give examples.

The

1

The State9s plan* that is, the plan in New York at

?,

the present time, divides unnecessarily the cities of Yonkers

3

in Westchester County just north of New York City, and Lackawanna,

4

just south of Buffalo»

5

necessary the city of Rochester in upper central New York,,

6

divides unnecessarily the town of Islip on Long Island, and it,

7

divides in ways that we think are undesirable but make no par­

8

ticular point of part of the boroughs in the City of New York»

t

Q

9
10

It divides much more substantially than
It

Do you say that not dividing cities is a per-

missible consideration?

11

A

Yes, sir»

12

Q

You just say that that really is just not true

13

in this case because at least they inconsistently applied the

14

principle®

15
16
17

j

A

Again, from Reynolds and Sims, and through the

more recent cases, it has been perfectly clear that one of the
factors that could be taken into account in justifying popu5

18

lation deviations of small amounts, is the desirability of

19

protecting against the gerrymander, and one way of protecting

20

against the gerrymander is to use whole political subdivision

21

units, so that there can be no charge that the lines are drawn

22

in ways that cannot be checked out®

23
24
25

But in the State of New York, the State legislative
Act here in question has unquestionably divided towns and cities
in ways that were not necessary®

I suggest ,!not necessary”
12

1

because the appellant himself has demised a plan which has been

2

before the Court throughout, which he does not assert is the

3

best plan, does not suggest is one that should be approved by

4

this Court or by the Legislature, but simply to show that on fcho

5

basis of an entire plan for the State of New York, it is possibl

6

to draw a plan that is more compact, more equal, and does not

7

divide any town or city that is not required to be divided be-’

8

cause of the substantiality of the population of that town,

9

county, or city.

10

So all these things have to be explained by the State

11

and they have not done so, certainly, on the basis of regionalit 7

12

Taka for example the 35th Congressional District, which stretche 3

13

from, virtually the outskirts of Rochester all the way over

14

virtually to Schenectady, a stretch of about 200 miles, more

15

than two-thirds of the whole State,

16

Now, we have some reason to know what the basis for

17

this district drawing was when it was first drawn in 1951.

It

18

was designed, according to the popular legend in New York, which

19

I have no reason to doubt, to make impossible the election of a

20

Democratic Congressman®

In fact, a Democratic Congressman has

21

been elected every time since then, so the purpose failed, but

22

there still remains no logic to that district except now as a

23

means of protecting the incumbent in that particular office.

!•

24

25

It is not a region.

It is not the Mohawk Valley, as

was asserted by witnesses before the hearing below.
13

It is not

A

i

land or area within the State of New York that makes any par-

2

fcicular sense except for the political reasons for which it was

3

originally drawn and has now been continued.

•r

4

The State has suggested that it is appropriate to

5

consider the so-called "blue line” counties together»

5

line is essentially the line drawn around the Adirondack Pre-

7

serve in upper northeastern New York, and that is the justifica­

8

tion, they say , for not drawing the district lines somewhat

S

more consistently with compactness and population, as appellant

to
11

The bits

has suggested.
But, in fact, the very counties that are at issue

12

here — Lewis County, to which reference has been made before —

13

is in the State legislative districts joined with a non-

14

Adirondack county, Oneida, which is a Mohawk Valley county.

15

So there is, again, no consistency of approach in the

16

State and there is, we believe, no justification for the lines

17

which have drawn that the State has satisfactorily advanced in

18

any of these points.

19

Th© State also argues that there is a factor of

21

legislative convenience. Perhaps this is the legislative fune- i
■
tion consideration that was discussed in the Missouri case.

22

They say the time was too short to devise a better plan.

23

the time, I call to their attention, was from May of 1967 when

24

the 196,1 plan was held unconstitutional, until March .1 of 1968,

25

th© deadline imposed by th© Court.

20

14

But

There was, indeed, time to

4

I

draw a more comprehensive, a more equality serving plan.

2

They suggest the necessity of preserving the election

3

districts whole, and this, of course, is a valid consideration

4

to minimize the dislocation of a .new plan.

5

Appellant, in drawing his plan, did not use election

6

j districts because he did .not haves, unlike the State, the popu­

7

lation of the election districts, but it. could have been done

8

just as well with election districts as with census tracts with

9

which he largely workede

10

So, again, it is a factor that could have been satis­

11

fied perfectly well and a plan that would have met the equality

12

and the compactness standards which we believe are appropr Late*

1.3

It is asserted also that this is the best plah that

14

could have been secured, but note that unlike Missouri, there

15

was no legislative compromise factor involved here.

16

was produced and was presented to the legislators on a fcake-it-

17

or-leave-it basis and it was perfectly clear that they were

18

expected to take it? both parties had agreed in advance that

'19

20

21

this was the plan that would best satisfy the give and take
of the political and the legislative process, and so it was
■passed without any substantial dissent in both Houses.
Q

22
23
24
25

The plan

This was done when one House had a majority

of Democrats and the other House had a majority of Republicans,
wasn5t it?

A

Yes, sir.

Thus distinguishing it from what had

15

I

been the previous situation in New York,, and in most States,

2

where both Houses are of a single party, where the plan is

3

worked out by that party and presented to the Legislature and

4

then that seems to have been the case in Missouri, but the dis™ •;

5

sent dispute is unavailable in those cases.
But here it was necessary to give something to both

3
7

parties in order to make the plan acceptable legislatively.
Further I call to your attention, and here you will

3
9
10

have to look at Appendix B, the map of Queens in New York City,
which is on that map.
The Sixth and the Eighth Congressional Districts, if

‘ii

12

they were to be added together, could be a reasonably compact,

13

almost

14

drawn as the interlocking wedges as though of two wrenches

working together.

But as you will notice, they have been

The question is why they were drawn in that

fashion?
The perfectly clear answer is that the Sixth District
is a Republican District and was intended to be so.

The Eighth

District is a Democratic District and was intended to be so.
I shall advert later, in connection with my argument
on gerrymander, to the exact evidence which shows that that
was not only the result but, as well, the .intent.
Let me turn now to the question of gerrymander to
which these arguments are, I believe, inextricably linked.
Here the question is deviation from equality and deviation from

16

1

compactness and the burden being# I believe, on the State to

as is well known, is that de­

vice by which a Legislature seeks to add to or diminish the

17

power of a political group, a racial group, a socio-economic

18

group, a religious group, or any other kind of group interest*

13

It is this that we believe is demonstrated in this case and it

20

is this that we believe must be prohibited in terms of the con­

Whether speaking in terms of Article I, Section 2, of

23

the Constitution, as in Wesberry versus Sanders, or in terms

24

of the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth

to disfavor some identifiable group is constitutionally imper­

missible o

3

The State has argued — I think not very strongly,

4

but it should be mentioned — that there is a doubt as to the

5

justiciability of the gerrymander issue.

6

on bits and pieces of lower Federal Court decisions and State

7

Courts with one exception: that is the affirmance by this Court

8

of the decision in WMCA versus Lomenzo, in which there was a

9

pro curiam affirmance of a decision of a 3-judge District Court

The reliance there is

10

below in which, among various points „ the Court had suggested

n

that the gerrymander was not a justiciable issue.

12

But the affirmance pro curiam seems equally susceptibl

13

to the point that this Court was not satisfied that there was

14

sufficient proof of a gerrymander in that case to warrant taking

15

it up on that particular issue.

16

likely that the Court has determined that the issue Is not

17

justiciable in view of the fact that WMCA was bracketed in time

18

by Fortson versus Dorsey from Georgia, and Burns versus Richard­

19

son from Hawaii, in each of which the Court explicitly recog­

20

nized the possibility that, in proper'circumstances, there might

21

be racial or political gerrymandering taken into account as a

22

basis for a holding of unconstitufcionality„

It becomes particularly un­

This, we believe, is a case in which those factors

24

are sufficiently evident, both affirmatively, and negatively

by inference, to justify the imposition of that rule in this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE D, ZUCKERMAN, ESQ.

z

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

3

MR. ZUCKERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

4

Court:

Before discussing New York’s 1968 Congressional Dis­

5

tricting Act, I believe it would be advisable if we briefly con­

6

sidered the background of this litigation.

7

As a result of the ISSO census, which reduced New

8

York’s Congressional Delegation from 43 to 41 seats, it was

9

necessary to draw new lines in 1961.

Now, although at that time

10

this Court had not yet come down with the decisions in Reynolds

11

versus Sims, Baker versus Carr, or Wesberry versus Sanders, the

12

New York Legislature in its report of the Joint Legislative

13

Committee on Reapportionment determined that the most important

14

criterion to follow is substantial equality of population.
At that time, the standard that was being recommended

13
16
17
18

19

20
?J

22
23
24
25

by the

American Academy of Political Science, by former Presi­

dent Truman, and by various Congressional leaders such as Con­
gressman Celler, was that no district should exceed the State
mean by more than 15 percent, and that is what the New York
Legislature did in 1961.
The present suit was instituted in 1966, and whan the
3-judge court reached its conclusion in 1967, they concluded
|
that whatever standard the Legislature may have followed in
1961 had become outmoded as a result of the recent decisions of
this Court.
20

1

They also particularly criticised the Congressional

2

Districts in Brooklyn under the 1961 Act, where disparities of

3

up to 29-1/2 percent existed among contiguous districts.

4

But when it came to determining an appropriate remedy:

5

the District Court, in its opinion, acknowledged that it might

6

be perferrable to wait until the 1970 census figures were avail-

7

able, rather than having the Legislature draw new lines in 1968

3

based on figures that were eight years old.

9

felt that the decisions of this Court in Swann versus Adams

!0

However, the Court

precluded such an extension.
Accordingly, to resolve this dileisma, the court below

1?
12

suggested a compromise which I would just like to quote from

13

because this was very important when the Legislature drew the

14

lines.

15

The court said:
"Acting upon the assumption that accurate Congres­

16

sional representation must await the 1970 census, and

17

upon the Supreme Court's understandable objection to pro­

18

tracted delay, a compromise may be in order.

19

1970 Congressional Districts ought to be held in districts

20

far more equalized than they are at present.

21

enough changes which can be superimposed on the present

22

distx*icfcs to cure the most flagrant inequalities.”

23
24
25

The 1968 and

There are

When the Legislature drew new lines in 1968, they
followed this admonition from the District Court? whereas, be­
fore six of the Congressional Districts were above 10 percent
21

i

from the State mean, and seven districts were below 10 percent

2

from the State mean, there is no district1in the 1968 Act which

3

is more than 10 percent»

5

minute.

The largest deviation, -6„6 percent,

As for appel/lant * s argument that the Legislature

6

didn’t: have time to consider this thing, first let me point out

8

that the Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment issued

9

a 2Q~page report which outlined its policies, and these were

IO

in the hands of the Legislature several weeks before the Act

11

was actually passed.

'

12

The bill was introduced on February 20th, and it was

13

six days later when the Legislature enacted the statute. After

14

considering the policies set forth in the report of the Joint

15

Legislative Committee on Reapporiioilment, and after hearing

16

witnesses for the State, and after giving any party —- or any

17

person, 1 might add —■ in the State an opportunity to criticize

18

these districts at a hearing in March of last year, the District

.

19

Court concluded that the Legislature had, indeed, cured the de­

20

fects under the prior 1S61 statute.

21

In Brooklyn, where the greatest disparities occurred,

22

as I mentioned, up to 29-1/2 percent under the 1961 lines, the

23

seven districts in this area are now all within one-tenth of

24

one percent of each other, and they are all less than two per­

25

cent from the State mean,
22

1

The minor population disparities that exist among

2

New York's districts rest upon rational State policies which

»j

O

were undertaken by the Legislature to first, of course, create

4

districts that are substantially equal in population, but at

5

the same time to respect the integrity of county lines where

6

possible, and to afford recognition to the natural geographical

7

and economic regions within the State of New York»
Now, in New York State the problems and the aspira­

tions of the people of New York City are far different from

10

those in Long Island or Westchester; or similarly, the problems

11

of the people in the Mohawk Valley and what they expect of

12.

their Representatives in Congress are far different from the

13

people in the Adirondack® or in the Niagara* frontier»
The State wanted to afford some recognition to these

14
15

regional considerations»

For example, the City of New York,

16

in light of its independent charter and its special political

17

and economic problems, was treated eis a separate entity, and

18

nobody, including appellant, has criticized this.
Dividing the population of New York City into the

there is more than just a body of water which separates Man­

5

When it came to drawing these lines, the Bronx pre­

6

sented a problem because its population was too large for just

7

three districts, but not large enough for four full districts.

3

Therefore, a small segment of the Bronx, being the southwest

9

portion, was attached to a district in Manhattan which it is

10

connected to by four bridges.
Altogether, the eight districts given to Manhattan

12

and the Bronx do not vary from each other by more than one-

Queens presented a problem because its population of

1,800,000 was too large for just four districts, but not large

State, and this was treated as a separate region in the drawing

of five Congressional Districts which are approximately equal to

When we move north of the New York City line, the

Legislature followed the county lines wherever possible.

or whatever you referred to, in terms of the justification of
population disparities among districts, let's suppose you have
a case where there is a very large population disparity betwe
District A and District B, and let us suppose that that popu­
lation disparity is a result of the Legislature's judgment that
it is appropriate to consider the border counties in District
A rather than District B because those border counties have
interests that are harmonious with the rest of District A, but
not harmonious with District B„

equality of population.

Well, let me get to the issue of gerrymandering,

because I think that presents rather complicated factors.
G

And I hope you will say something about Six and

Eight, Districts 6 and 8.
A

Yes, I will.

First let me say, at the outset, that this Court has
never held that partisan gerrymandering presents a cognisable
issue under the Fourteenth Amendment.

I would say on tha facts

of this case, it would be hard to imagine a weaker test case
than the present one to bring forth this issue.
There is a great deal of confusion, first of all,
about what gerrymandering means.

The evil of the original

gerrymandered districts in Massachusetts was not that they
31

1

took the shape of a salamander or a dragon.

2

that the result was expected to produce a completely dispropor­

3

tionate share of seats to one party, and when I say "dispropor­

4

tionate'’ 1 mean because the lines were drawn in such a way that

5

one party was expected to get many more seats than their gen­

6

eral voting patterns in the State would entitle them to.

The evil there was

1 think we often lose sight of this in looking at

7
8

district lines in the abstract.

9

esthetically pleasing, but it is not the sols answer.

Compactness certainly is
You

10

could have perfectly compact districts and you could still have

11

partisan abuses, depending upon where various groups lie within

12

the State.
Now, assuming that, gerrymandering presented a justic­

13
14

iable issue, I believe it should be evident that appellant has

13

failed to present any evidence which would justify this Court

16

overturning the districts on that basis.
First of all, in any districting plan there is always

17
13

going to be certain districts which are going to favor one party

19

and districts which will favor another party.

20

in one of his articles entitled "Reapportiosment Reappraised”

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

3

MR, McKAY:

May it please the Court* two brief*

4

specific points* one in response to Mr. Justice White's earlier

5

question about Gong versus Kirk.

S

As I see the District Court opinion in that case*

7

which is 278 Fed. Supp. 133* which is the one that I believe .

8

was affirmed by this Court* the reference there is to the dis­

9

parity in

There was.

There was a motion for reconsidera­

12

tion in the District Court* which brought the other figures to

13

the District Court's attention and the figures were discussed

14

in the jurisdictional statement in response here* to some ex­

15

tent.

16

Now* could I ask you if you would make the same argu­

17

ment on gerrymander here* whether there was any population

18

disparity or not?

19

A

Yes* sir? I would.

It. was emphasized and exag­

20

gerated by the two facts of substantial population deviations*

21

otherwise unexplained* and the lack of compactness, which makes

22

th® district suspect* and then there is also affirmative evi­

23

dence in this case that --

24
25

Q

Is it also your claim here that the population

disparities themselves were energised by a gerrymandering motive ?
40

1

2
3

A

Yes, sir? at least, in part.

Let me give you some

examples of that, if I may.
I will first make reference to my own writing, the

4

fact that the drawing of political lines is never neutral.

S

course, that is true.

6

and of the earlier decisions of this Court, as I understand it,

7

is to make sure that it be as neutral as possible and it be as

8

free of erroneous, nonperznissible considerations as possible.

S

We go, then, right to the question of whether it is

Now, the question was raised by Mr. Justice Fortas

25

Q

Is one independent ground of yours that they

are gerrymandering?

2

A

Yes*, sir.

3

Q

It does not depend at all upon

of the voters,, one man-one vote?

We make both arguments, Your Honors that there

are substantial population inequalities that are not explained

by any rational and permissible ground; and that there is a

8

gerrymander»

9
10
11

Q

Which constitutional provision

do you rely on

as to the gerrymandering?

A

On both the equal protection clause of the

12

Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, Section 2.

13

tation , the vote by the people, is within Article X,7 Section 2,

14

and that to us means equality and fairness, and the equal pro­

IS

tection clause, of course, means that there shall not be arbi­

18

trarily drawn districts,

17

Q

Fair represen­

With reference to constitutional principles,

18

do you say that in addition to actual population equality, con­

19

stitutionally there is also required compactness?

20

A

Yes, sir,

21

Q

And that is the way von handle it, or express

22
23
24
23

it, that gerrymandering can’t be done, whether it is for con­
servationist, religious, political, or other grounds, because
you would introduce the element of compactness, the consti­
tutional principle?

42

1

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

I have forgotten, it is some while now, but

3

didn’t, the old 1912 statute, the Federal Statute, as I recall

4

it, used to have the criteria of compactness, contiguity —•

5

A

And contiguity.

Was there also population?

Now that, of course, was repealed.

In the old

Groom case, wasn’t there some consideration of compactness as
a constitutional criterion, or not?

Was it raised or suggested or discussed?

A

Whether it was raised, I am not sure? but there '

was no decision on that point.
Q

But in any event, you would ask us to add to

IS

substanticil population equality, a constitutional requirement

17

of compactness.

18

A

That is correct.

19

Q

Nov? what about contiguity?

20

A

And contiguity, I think, quite clearly.

21

Q

Well then what you would have us do then, ulti­

22

mately, I take it, is to convert those statutory criteria, add­

23

ing the population equality, as we have now defined it, into

24

constitutional criteria.

2-5

A

Yes, sir.
43

i

I

?

Q

May I ask you,, along the same lines that my

2

brother Brennan has been asking questions, do you really mean

3

that, or do you mean that where there is gerrymandering, the

4

likelihood is very great that the result of it will be to dilute

S

or arbitrarily to manipulate the effect of the individual's

6

vote so that, in short, are you talking about two constitutional*

7

principles here, or one?
One constitutional principle has been popularly called

8
9

the one man-one vote principle.

Now, is gerrymandering under

10

that heading, or is it something different in constitutional

It

terms?
A

12

I believe it is a function of the equality

13

argument.

Our proposition, I think, would run this way: that

14

substantial equality is required.

15

v/ould be enough to justify reversal.

In

this case, that alone

But in addition, in order to make the equality aspect

17

work, as someone suggested, it is only one part of a pair of

18

pliers

19

be protection against use of the districting process for imper­

20

missible purposes or else equality serves no real function of

21

itself.

22

equality.

In order to make it work, there must also

So our second argument is that equality and compactnes s

23

must be satisfied in reasonable ways and where it is not satis­

24

fied, the State must explain.

25

Some explanations can be given.

But in this case there are no satisfactory explanations and,

44

i

indeed, there is affirmative evidence of a conscious intent to

2

gerrymander for partisan reasons.

3

Q

Well, if I live in the northeast section of a

4

State and the Legislature gerrymanders the State — to take an

S

extreme and, therefore, absurd example to illustrate the point

6

so as to put my .area in with the extreme southwest portion of

7

the State so that they will put together a Democratic district,

8

then it seems to rae that what has happened is that my vote as

9

a resident of one of these extreme areas is being manipulated.

10

A

Yes, sir.

11

Q

And that does bear upon the principle of equal

12

effect of my vote.

13

A

Right.

14

Q

And it is from that principle, I take it, that

15

you would derive a constitutional basis for your insistence upon

16

an absence of gerrymandering.

17

A

Quite clearly so.

In this case there is, in

18

addition, the affirmative evidence of conscious purpose for

19

partisan or bipartisan results and, in addition, as Mr. Zucker-

20

man has just conceded, there was an effort to secure a conser­

21

vationist district, which seems to me to pervert the old rural-

22

urban dichotomy that was the thrust of Reynolds versus Sims.

23

Q

We don't have to r^ach this gerrymandering ques­

24

tion if we agree with you that the substantial population prin­

25

ciples have been met.
45
