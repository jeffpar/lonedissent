THE CLERK:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Counsel are present.
Mr. Rutledge, you may

proceed with your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL P. RUTLEDGE
ON BE HALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. RUTLEDGE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

10

Court, this is another of a long series of cases that have

11

come before this court with increasing frequency in this

12

century which poses a familiar problem of states' rights on

13

one hand versus federal control or preemption of economic

14

relations affecting interstate commerce.

15

This is the second appearance before this court of

16

this case in the sense of the conduct that is involved.

17

prior case came up in the federal court and it arises out of

18

a long-standing strike against the Florida East Coast Railway

19

which runs in Florida roughly from Jacksonville to Miami.

20

Florida East Coast Railway is the last one-way railroad covered

21

by the Interstate Commerce Act and the Railway Labor Act.

22

The strike involved is a legal strike arising out

23

of the Railway Labor Act.

24

changes in working conditions.

25

The

The stride concerned proposed

The unions that are involved in the case are the
2

The

Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Order o£ Railway Conductors*
and Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, all Who
represent railroad employees who operate the trains.
Those unions went on strike against the Florida East
Coast Railroad in April 1966 and within a few weeks following
the beginning of that strike* the picketing commenced.

The

picketing wos peaceful and orderly and it went on for a period
of only a few yearsand it was enjoined in a suit brought
by the respondent in this case in the United States District
Court in Jacksonville.
That court issued a temporary restraining order
and subsequently converted to a prelirainary injunction.

That

injunction was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
of the Fifth Circuit which vacated the injunction May 1966.
The respondent then promptly filed an application
to reinstate the injunction.

This court exfcradicted the time

involved in the petition to assert and reinstated the injunction
over a summer recess and set the case down for hearing in
October 1966, at which time the decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit under Chief Judge Tulley of
that court was affirmed.
The picketing that is involved is picketing that
concerns the Florida Ea3fc Coast Railroad and also the
Jacksonville Terminal Compary and also, we submit, it was of
crucial importance to examine the relationship between those
3
I

i
2

two.
In Jacksonville, which is the northern terminus

3

of the Florida east coasta there is a Jacksonville Terminal

4

Company which is jointly owned by the Florida East Coast

5

Railroad together with the Atlantic Coastline, Seaboard and

6

Southern Railways.

1

9

Q

Mr. Rutledge, the Court of Appeals for the

Fifth Circuit set aside the injunction?
A

That’s right.

In other words, the holding of

10

that court, as I understand it, was that the Korris-LaGuardia

II

Act did not preclude issuance of an injunction in this case.

12

There were other contentions raised before the Court of

13

Appeals specifically the contention we raise here and this is

14

a case argued in the National Labor Relations Act.

13

did not pass on that.

16

The court

The Jacksonville Terminal Company, as I say, is

17

owned by the Florida East Coast and its operations are

18

controlled by a document which is approved by the Interstate

19

Commerce Commission and which is in evidence in this case,

20

which in essence is a document which spells out a joint venture

21

by the four owning railroads whereby each on© is entitled to

22

use,without discrimination,

23
24

to receive the labor services of the employees of the terminal.
V
Operating under this agreement, the Florida East

25

Coast regularly runs its trains under the terminal company
4

of all of the facilities and

1

and that is the only way they are able to receive deliveries

2

from other railroads or make deliveries to other railroads

3

and, very significantly# on those premises of the Jacksonville

4

Terminal Company, PEC regularly and on a regular# daily

5

basis receives essential labor services performed for it toy

S

the employees of the Jacksonville Terminal Company,

7

I think the best illustration of that is shown In

3

the record at page 99 where the president and general manager

3

of the Jacksonville Terminal Company formally advises the

10

general chairman of one of these unions as follows2

11

"Jacksonville Terminal Company employees represented

12

toy Order of Railway Conductors are expected to perform service

13

for the Florida East Coast Hallway Company in line with their

14

previously assigned duties and you are requested to join with

IS

me to see that the Order of this high court is carried out."

16

So that these employees of the TerminaICoiapany are

17
18

daily performing labor services for this common carrier.
It is significant, we submit, to examine in detail

19

the nature of the arguments here in two lights, one by us, of

20

course# and the other toy the respondent.

21

The respondent is contending that this picketing

22

is secondary picketing# whatever that means.

23

significant in this respect, however

24

picketing was limited exclusively to points around the perimeter

25

of the Terminal Company where the Jacksonville Terminal Company

,

5

It is

to note that our

j

1

employees reported for work, in other words, reported to begin

2

their day in which they would be asked to do labor services

3

for the strike area, or to entrances where employees of

4

connecting carriers would come on the premises either to take

5

to or take a delivery from the Florida East Coast Bailway.

8

There is one particular crossing, the Dennis Street

7

crossing, which is referred to in here which we did not picket.

8

There is no evidence of our picketing that crossing.

9

was a dirt road next to it which we picketed where employees

There

10

came on the premises.

1!

used exclusively by the Atlantic Coastline and was not picketed.

12

But the Dennis Street crossing was

We submit that we were not going to the Atlantic

13

Coastline to say that “we want you to stop making deliveries

14

to FEC" and picketing the Atlantic Coastline in order to put

IS

pressure on them.

18
17

We were picketing as close as we could to the actual
site where work was being performed for EEC or where delivery

ia was being made to or from the FEC.
19

Under this situation, the picketing began May 5, 1968

20

and the Court o:: Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the

21

injunction in a matter of weeks later that same month in

22

May 1966 and after the injunction was vacated and while the

23

respondent was applying to this court to reinstate the

24

injunction, the respondent filed the state court suit in the

25

Qourt of general jurisdiction in Jacksonville.
6

i

That courts, after hearing testimony over the

z

weekend of May 30, entered a preliminary injunction.

3

sought a reversal in the appellate court as

4

had no jurisdiction.

5

court asking for a reversal of the order of the intermediate

6

appellate court and that petition was denied,

7

That was denied.

We

the state court

We came to this

Meanwhile, the state court proceeded on final hearing

8

and a permanent injunction was entered July 1966.

9

appealed to the intermediate court and the supreme court.

That was

i

10

The holding of the Florida court was that the

11

picketing here involved was illegal under Florida state law

12

and was also illegal under Florida common labor lav; which,

13

according to the court, is illegal under Florida law.

14

Significantly, the Florida state court did not rely

13

on either the Florida statute which regulates public utility

16

labor relations because the Florida legislature in passing

17

that law expressly exempted railroads and railroad employees

18

covered by the Railway Labor Act,

19

Significantly the Florida court did not rely on

20

the Florida statute that regulates labor relations

21

generally in Florida because that statute also exempts railroads

22

or airlines covered by Railway Labor Act.

23

The underlying question in this case is whether

24

federal law or state law governs the conduct that is

25

here involved?

The conclusion that has to be reached is
7

I

1

whether the conduct is legal or illegal under federal law.

2

And significantly the question has to he reached whether the

3

KorriS-LaGuardia Act applies to the state court which is

4

adjudicating a labor dispute: case controlled by federal law?

5

Is such a court under those circumstances covered

6

either expressly by the Act is in any event a court which must

7

apply principles of the Horris-LaGuardia Act because these are

8

the principles controlling the federal law?

9

If, on the other hand, this court should decide that

10

the state law applies here, then the question must be

11

presented as to whether or not this is a case which is argued

12

to the exclusive primary jurisdictions of the national Labor

13

Relations Board and therefore under this San Diego Building

14

Trade decision and many decisions, the state court lacks

15

jurisdiction to even try the case.

13

Underlying the entire case is the contention raised

17

in the trial court, passed upon by the state court, that the

18

conduct involved in this case protects the conduct by the

19

person.

20

In this regard, it is important to note that the

21

trial court made a finding in this case that there was

22

absolutely no force, violence, threat of violence, mass

23

picketing, or any force of any sort involved in the picketing.

24

It was peaceful.

25

It was orderly.

'There were single pickets stationed around the
8

1

perimeter and there was no kind of violence or blockage of

2

traffic or interference in any way.

3

Petitioners contend that federal law controls here

4

and that federal law makes the conduct here involved legal

5

and therefore the decision should be remanded in order that

S

the case be adjudicated in accordance with the federal law.

7

The problem here is# what is and what is not legal

8

of a strike arising out of a Railway labor Act major dispute

9

which picketing is entirely peaceful and does not entrench

10

on any of the areas concerning preserving law and order

11

in picketing?

12

Congress has regulated railway and labor relations

13

since 1888.

14

where in an interstate industry which has not been regulated

15

by labor relations# have not been regulated by Congress

16

until 1935, and where the title of the regulation is so

17

detailed as to be autonomous# to say that those labor relations

18

are completely preempted by federal law# but the labor

19

relations in the railway industry which is directly in

20

intersteste commerce have not been preempted and are subject

21

to varying state policies, fifty different policies.

22

It would be anomalous indeed to have a situation

We submit that in deciding which law# state or

23

federal# applies here, that this is again a situation that

24

Justice Holmes refers to where "a page of history is worth

23

a volume of logic" and it is quite clear that with passage
9

of the Interstate Commerce Act in late 1880’s and passage
of the Sherman Act in 1890, the kind of conduct that is here
involved was subjected to federal control and there were a
series of cases following enactment of those federal statutes
which ruled that picketing seeking to interrupt the conduct of
business between two railroads was illegal conduct.
Following those decisions there were the Railway
Labor Acts of 1926 and 1932, the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley
Act# which we submit show that Congress has repeatedly taken
under consideration whether to make this kind of conduct legal
or illegal, and. it has on a pragmatic basis passed laws which,
although originally may foe the kind of conduct herein, from
1940 or at least from 1942 on, legalises the kind of conduct.
And the State of Florida cannot by its law make
illegal that which Congress, regulating the railroad industry,
has deliberately made legal.
Q

Would you cite the legislation?

A

Yes, your Honor.

The legislative history of the

Clayton Act, the frustration of what the proponents of the
Clayton Act felt was the purpose by this court decision in the
Deering case, then the legislative history of the MorrisLa Guard ia Act, then the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in
1947, which the legislation is set out in our brief, in which
Senator Taft said that with the passage of the Act, it has
become impossible to stop a secondary boycott, and the purpose
10

I

1

of the Taft-Hartley Act was to make secondary boycotts in

2

business affecting interstate commerce illegal.

<n

O

Then the question came up, what about in the

4

railroad industry?

5

Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, secondary boycotts

6

did not become illegal.
Q

7

In other words, with the passage of the

That is what I am trying to get to.

Was there

8

a specific reference then to the situation of picketing for

9

the purpose of stopping an interchange of cars?

10

A

Ho, your Honor.

The reference that we cited was

11

whether the passage of the Taft*-Hartley regulating the type

12

of picketing should be applicable to the railroad industry and

13

employees.

14

We submit that Congress has had this question before

13

it.

16

court in the Webb case and many cases, that any kind of picketing

17

that interfered with interchange of railroad cars is illegal.

IS
19
20

There is no question but that under the decision of this

It is interfering with interstate commerce and
interstate trade.
This court’s decision establishes the fact that the

21

intent of the Clayton Act and Morris-LaGuardia case was to

22

change the decision of this court and it was to adopt the view

23

of justice Brandeis.

24

We say this has been a matter of very close federal

25

and congressional attention, and for the state now to come in

11

and hinder the balance of economic power would create an
intolerable situation particularly when you magnify that fift y
times, particularly when you have in this area these large
mergers.
There is a merger going on in the Pacific northwest
to create a railroad system spanning thousands and thousands
of miles.
You have, we submit, individual state legislation
by which the state court 1» legislating the balance of economic
power in the railroad industry, which we submit would create
chaos.

And we submit that this is the kind of a case which

must be controlled^ deriving its authority from any federal
statutes and from the entire scheme of those statutes.
Our basic contention in this case is that the
conduct involved is to go by federal law and to legalise this
type of conduct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

21

23

And there

Mr. Lyons.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY DENNIS G. LYONS
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LYONS?

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

24

court, with respect to the facts in this matter, there are

25

three factual questions which I would like to speak to further
13

\

than counsel for petitioners has.

2

Those three questions are, first, what goes on in

3

the terminal?

Second, what was the conduct of the petitioners?

4

Third, what was the effect of that conduct?
The name, Jacksonville Terminal, is rather a

3
6

misnomer.

The Jacksonville Terminal is not simply a terminal

7

place where trainmen stop.

0

trains must go through.

9

Coastline Railroad is this line here, this blue line coming

It is primarily a place where

The principal main line of the Atlantic

10

down through the terminal property which is shown in green

11

and exiting here at the souths being shown in blue.

12

One of the principal main lines of the Seaboard

13

Railroad is this line coming through here, this orange line

14

coming through north of Savannah and going through the terminal

15

here and exiting here and then going to the south.
The terminal stands athwart the main railroad linas

16
17

that serve the State of Florida.

If you cut off the

10

terminal, you to a very substantial extent cut off all railway

19

service to Florida.

21

There is one basic x^ay to
I
get to it by land from the north and, accordingly, the State

22

of Florida is quite vulnerable to a cutting off of the

23

Jacksonville Termina1.

20

Florida is a peninsula.

24
25

We have heard a great deal of talk about work done
for FEC.

Let’s put that in prospective.
14

FEC uses the

?

terminal in two ways.

2

These cars are brought across the bridge across the St. Johns

3

River, up from the PEC yard which is down about another

4

twelve miles to the south, end they are brought here by their

5

crews and at various places around here they meet the carriers

S
7

that they are to be delivered to, and delivery is made.
i
Similarly, at pickup the cars are brought in the

8

terminal or elsewhere and interchange takes place and the cars

9

puli bdck down.

10

In one way, trains are interchanged.

Only 30 percent oi the interchange movements within

r#

the terminal property or

12

FEC.

18

which are of the non-struck carriers. Seaboard, Coastline

14

and Southern, none which has, a labor dispute.

using the terminal facilities are

So on one side you have all of these going through

IS

We also have interchanges which do involve handling

16

of the cars from one railway.to another.

17

those are EEC's.

18

activity within the terminal.

19

passenger trains a day through the terminal, the non-struck

20

carriers.

21

and in that connection they received the same terminal

22

services, selling tickets, washing . of cars, that the other

23

non-struck carriers received.

Only 30 percent of

We also used to have some FEC passenger train
The other carriers ran 42

FEC ran 2 passenger trains a day into the terminal

24

These passenger movements accounted for less than

25

one percent of the total passenger cars handled through the
15

1
2

terminal
Incidentally, after making the record in this case,

3

there is no dispute about it, PEC received permission to

4

extend more passenger service and accordingly there is no use

S

whatsoever of the terminal by the FEC passenger trains.

11

Now, as to the content of the petitioners' question,
what dees the picketing consist of.
The picketing consisted, as the trial court found,
of placing pickets at every entrance to the terminal, every
entrance by rail, road and on foot.
The trial court's finding covered the entrance at

12

Dennis Street and found they were only placed.at the Coastline

IS

exit and entrance.

14

It is undisputed that there was picketing at Acorn

15

Street which is right here where only Seaboard main line

16

movements enter, as you see.,

17

would have to come in this v?ay or come across from its yard

18

and come across this way.

19

The Seaboard terminal movements

This line cuts right across the terminal and is

20

used by the main line trains and that line is cut.

21

signs did not simply say, ”3?lease don't handle PEC cars."

22

The picket signs contained two exhortation^ on them.

23

first exhortation was:

24

honored the picket line.

25

"Do not cross."

The picket

The

The railroad men

The condition stated later on, indeed, stated in
16

1

papers filed in this court by counsel* was that the solution

2

to the matter was placing of an embargo on the FEC by the

3

carriers»

4

But the appeal that the pickets made to the employees in order

S

to make their employer hurt enough to do that wasz

8

cross»1’

7

In other words* s refusal to handle their cars»

"Do not

"Do not go within the terminal»1
The effect of this picketing* as the trial court found,

8

was a threat to the economic strangulation of the State of

9

Florida»

10

Ninety-five percent of the U. S. mail to and from

11

Florida passes through the terminal. If the terminal was shut do* Ti

12

one day* it would take six days to catch up on the U,S. mail.

13

A very substantial portion of the citrus crop and

14

other basic products of Florida exports* the phosphates from

IS

the fields in Florida* have to pass through the terminal if

16

they are going to move by rail and rail is one of their

17

primary means of movement.

18

There are numerous industries that have settled in

19

Jacksonville either directly adjacent to the terrains! property

20

or on spurs leading off of the terminal property where cars

21

have to go through the terminal property which are cut off

22

from all rail access if the terrains 1 were shut down.

23

So we have here* I don't purport to give an

24

identification of secondary picketing* but I think if anything

25

is secondary picketing, the conduct here is secondary picketing.
17

1

There was an appeal by these employees of the FEC,

2

the former employees of the FEC to two other carriers'

3

employees to induce them to stop work, not to go within the

4

terminal until such time as their employers saw fit to stop

5

doing business with FEC.

6

At appropriate tines the terminal company* which is

7

the respondent here, and in federal cases of the other non-

8

struck carriers, sued both in the federal courts and after a

9

decision that there was no federal court jurisdiction, sued

10
11

in the state court for an injunction.
One basis on which the federal court backs the state

12

court where this action took place was the finding of the

13

Fifth Circuit that there was no federal court jurisdiction

14

in the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

15

You are faced also with the fact that there was no

16

jurisdiction in the appellate court at that time and that the

17

if&r complaint was brought solely under state law,

to

Q

What was the judgment?

19

A

The judgment of the Fifth Circuit was that the

20

decision had to be reversed because there was no jurisdiction

21

in the federal court.

22

was a judgment in favor of the present petitioners.

That was the Fifth Circuit Court which

23

Q

That was on the same grounds?

24

A

On the same grounds, yes, sir.

25

So it has been

ruled there is no jurisdiction in the federal court by reason
18

1

of ftorris-LaGuardia.

2

court is another matter»

3

Whether that is binding in the present

This case comes before the court in this posture»

4

There is a state court injunction granted under state law.

5

There is no question to be raised with respect to state laws

6

Their most serious basis or at least the one they

13

spent the most time on was that by reason of the Railway Labor

14

Act and certain other statutes, they refer to the Safety

15

Appliance Act, which doesn't seem to have much to do with

16

the case, but by reason of these federal railway statutes,

17

there is a supersession of state law jurisdiction here and

18

they rely for analogy on this court’s ruling under the Taft-

19

Hartley Act

20

Hartley Act and after addition of Section 84 to the Labor

21

Management Relations Act in 1947, there? was a long line of

22

cases in this court holding that the states would not be

23

prohibited by section 8{b) or protected under Section 7.

24
25

where in the long line of cases after the Taft-

Our basic contention is that this whole line of
argument is a false analogy.
19

There is simply not a comparable

'i

situation here between the Taft “Hartley Act and the Railway

z

Labor Act»

Under the Taft-Hartley Act you have detailed the sort

and involved section.

There is another side of that coin.

It is

There is

Section 1 of the Act which to a great extent says that conduct

10

which is not prohibited by Section 8(b) is protected under

U

Section 7.

12

Beside

that very detailed code» there is also an

13

administrative agency which is charged with adjudicating

14

matters under that code.

15

the Railway Labor Act.

18

regulation whatsoever under the Railway Labor Act of

17

assorted weapons that a union can use against management

18

and certainly none whatsoever of the regulation of the weapons

19

it can use against third parties to a labor dispute.

20

There is nothing like that under
There is no regulation whatsoever, no

And while there are certain administrative agencies

21

that have been set up toy Congress under the Railway Labor

22

Act, the Adjustment Board and Ad Hoc Presidential Board under

23

Section 10, there is no administrative agency set up under

24

that Act which is charged with the duty of passing on whether

25

specific union weapons or specific management self help are
50

\

2

protected or prohibited.
This is an area which Congress simply 'has not ruled

3

on and our contention is that just as the case that was

4

decided a few weeks ago, that there is room for a current

5

regulation here, both by the state

8

in an area where federal power has not specifically asserted

7

itself, and here the federal power has not asserted itself

8

foy regulating the sort of weapons that unions may use and

9

particularly the sort of weapons that they can use against

10

and by the federal court,

third parties.

11

There is -no general law against picketing.

12

Q

13
14

Is there a law under the Taft--Bart ley Act

that provides that employees of a railroad can picket?
A

There is a "little" Taft-Hartley law or there

IS

is a State Interrelations Act in Florida which gives workers

16

the right to engage in assorted activities.

17

18
19

It doss not apply directly to workers and railway
labor people.
The basis of the injunction here was the state law

20

against secondary boycotting.

2!

against the picketing as such.

The injunction was not passed

22

Q

Did it enjoin all picketing in an area?

23

A

lo, there were exceptions.

In the first place;

24

curiously enough, the petitioners did not picket

25

main rail used by the Florida East Coast Railroad.
2.1.

. the
The

picketing is permitted at the reserve gate for the use of PEC
employees.

There has been a reserve gate at the terminal for

years and the injunction is limited and does not cover the
men and they are free to picket there and are free to picket
at the main railway entrance and are free to picket up and
down the line of eastern Florida where EEC runs.
f«3y argument would have fallacy in it if we could
induce a basic contention by Congress to affirmatively sanction
secondary picketing on railways, in other words, if we could
say that Congress wanted to protect this sort of conduct.
The fact that it had been set up, which was designed
to regulate, would not, of course, support the state court
injunction.
I feel my case would be easier if it was and I am
sure my brother feels his case would be easier if it was not.
I suppose the fact, like the cases back in 1940, seeras to
hold that states have definite and recognisable interests with
respect to remanding the extension of labor disputes to persons
who are not parties to them through application of the anti-trust
laws, such as was done here in the application.

And 1

think that does affect the issues, although I would not say
this is possible.
We contend there was absolutely no evidence that
Congress ever intended to affirmatively sanction the use of
the secondary boycott on the railroad industry.
22

\

The petitloners, as 2 understand it, point to the

z !Clayton Act first, under which it was held that a secondary
3

boycott was not legal»

4

to the history of the Taft“Hartley Act in which they appear to

5

contend that Congress is inclined to outlaw the secondary

6

boycott of the railroads because they felt the secondary

7

boycott was a good thing.
On page 46 of our brief v;e refer to a discussion by

3

9

Senator Tafts
"In this bill we prohibit secondary boycotts all

10
11

And the most amazing is the reference

over this country."

12

And one of the ocher Senators raised the question

13

and asked, "Well, what about railroads?"

14

quoted is that railway workers have not been engaging in such

15

practices and there was no abuse here and no use for Congress

16

to alter the scheme of the labor act.
We put that in our brief starting at page 45 to

17
10
19

And the discussion

page 48,

Senator Taft Said?
"We saw no reason to change that situation, because

20

there were no abuses which had arisen in connection with the

2!

operation of the Railway Labor Act,"

22

Indeed, this is really a neat case.

There is no

23

precedent for a situation like this in which there is

24

picketing of non-struck carriers on an interchange.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS G. LYONS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT (continued)

8

MR. LYONS:

Thank you.

9

Before recess we were developing the point that

10

Congress never affirmatively sanctioned the use of secondary

11

conduct against nonstruct carriers by rail unions.

12

cussed the history of the Taft-Hartley Act.

13

And we dis­

The paradox in what the Petitioners are contending

14

for, if Congress through some process of silent or some process

15

of silent approval of this form of extended self-help against

16

third parties, made this conduct lawful in this context, we

17

would have the paradoxical situation in which it would be

18

unlawful to engage in this conduct, in an industry regulated

19

under the Taft-Hartley Act, a toy factory, a candy factory,

20

any factory producing goods for Interstate Commerce in the

21

jurisdictional minimum, but it would not be unlawful to

22

practice this conduct against a railroad, against an instru­

23

mentality of Interstate Commerce, against one of the more vitalj

24

and basic of American industries.

25

I think really the point needs no further development.

1

There is no evidence whatsoever that Congress ever put its

2

stamp of approval on this conduct.

5

these circumstances that it meant to leave it completely

Nov; there are three further bases of contention that

7
8

the Petitioners make.

They contend first that the Norris-

9

LaGuardia Act, second that the Taft-Hartley Act and third that

10

the Fourteenth Amendment preclude the injunction that was

11

granted here by the State courts„
I will give our responses to those briefly because

12
13

we frankly submit these are make-way intentions.
Q

14
15

here that, in addition to the Federal law doesn't control?
A

16
17
18

Is it the same as saying, are you just saying

Yes, this is an additional basis on which it

doesn't control.

There are other statutes that the Petitioners

bring in on somewhat different basis.
Q

19

You may be right in all those points you just

20

made and Federal law could still control.

21

then you would still have the question left what the Federal

22

law is.

23
24
25

A

Well you would.

Isn't that the —-

The basis, the various bases

that we are submitting and that we have submitted are negations
of the applicability of Federal lav;, any basis.
25

We contend it

j

J

I

1

doesn't apply because of the Railway Labor Act and it doesn't

2

apply because of the Taffc-Hartley Act.
Q

3

Well, would you say that if the court decided

4

Federal law does govern in this case that you have lost the

5

case?

8

A

I wouldn't so submit, your Honor, because the,

7

that would then for one thing throw open these questions, these

8

additional questions.

9
10

First, whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act would have
to be applied by the State Court in applying the Federal Court, I
j

M

second whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibits this injunc-

12

tion and the only holding on this was a 4 to 4 decision by this |

13

court which is not a binding precedent.

14

everything that we said before.

15
16
17

Federal law did apply I don’t think it necessarily means that

19

stance of Federal law.

20

A

23
24

25

i

the State court judgment would come first.
£3

22

;

And those would be our submissions, even if the

18

21

On that we submit

In other words, it would be what is the sub­

Yes.

Yes, sir.

And that could very well be,

. as we contended in the other case, where xse sought injunction
under the Railway Labor Act and the Interstate Commerce Act,
but those statutes which aimed at

minimizing the conflict on

the railroads in trying to confine industrial disputes,
certainly never contemplated that there would be any secondary

26

I

1

boycott .against a nanstruck carrier, against a person who never!

2

had advantage of the processes of the Railway Labor Act»
We would also contend for reasons that we contended

3
4

before that the Norris-LaGuardia Act wouldnot apply even if

5

this case were governed by Federal law.
If it is governed by State law in a State court we

6
7

submit there is no basis whatsoever for saying it applies.

a

There is a somewhat different argument that the Petitioners

9

make.

10
11
12

13

It develops that the Petitioners, that the union that

basically did the picketing» The Brotherhood of Railroad Train­
men, it also represents bus drivers.

membership are bus drivers and the bus drivers, of course, had
nothing to do with this dispute.
But the Petitioners contend that it is therefore

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

2.2
23
24

Seven percent of its

arguable that the National Labor Relations Board has juris­
diction.

Now they further contend that it does not have juris-*
j

diction, that is our contention, too.

Nobody contends that

the National Labor Relations Board has jurisdiction in this
case.
But they submit that because seven percent of their
membership off on these other launches are bus drivers, are
not under the Railway Labor Act, that therefor© as I understand
its in every case involving this large union that there is
an arguable applicability cf the Taft-Hartley Act and that
accordingly the State courts would have to stay their hands,

25

27

t

and I would assume also that the agencies set up under the

2

Railway Labor Act, the Mediation Board and the Adjustment

3

Boards would be in the same posture.

4

We think that to state that sort of contention is

5

really to answer it that the courts have generally looked to

6

the particular aspect of the union, particular aspect of the

7

work that is involved.

3

railroad industry.

This is a dispute wholly within the

The brotherhoods are predominantly railroad brother­

9
10

hoods, they are predominantly, their lodges are entirely

tl

railroad workers, the employers are all common carriers, we

12

submit there is no basis arguable or otherwise for this appli­

1.3

cability of Taft-Hartley.
On the First Amendment applicability our contention

14
15

is that this is not a State law against picketing, this is a

16

State law against specific abuses and the injunction was so

17

limited.

18

I think it is well just to take a moment to see

19

what it is the Petitioners are contending for in this case

20

before this court this morning.

21

they will have established that there is no agency of Govern-

22

ment, Federal, State or local, judicial or administrative, that!

23

can regulate their conduct in applying these measures, these

24

economic warfare measures to these nonstruck carriers.

conduct can be regulated, or if it is not applicable, left

wholly unregulated, the State courts, and it is that last

10

avenue of relief against this action which would tie up the

11

entire economy of Florida, which would be unlawful if practiced

12

in any other industry.

Q

Would you mind saying a word in response to this!

A

To the point, your Honor, of —- that there is no!

authority -Q

No man’s land with no regulation of any kind.
29

1

A

Certainly =

2

Your Honor, our response to that is that what

3

Congress has deliberately left free to competing economic

4

forces the States cannot move in and outlaw and as Senator Taft

5

stated and quoted, there have not been abuses in the railroad

6

industryo

7

I don't think it would take very long for Congress to act to

8

make Section 8(B)4 of Taft-Hartley applicable to railroad

9

unions»

When there are abuses it will ba time enough and

That has been proposed, it could be passed in a natter

10

of days by Congress and Congress has acted

in situations in

n

the railroad industry where national disputes have occurred.
It set up, just recently, the unprecedented situation

12

14

of compulsory arbitration on working conditions prospectively, j
s
So we say that this certainly isn't a matter that is beyond

15

completely all regulation, and that Congress has left this

16

kind of thing free and Congress can act if there is an abuse.

17

I would like to point out also in rebuttal that the

13

i

18

decree in answer to question from Mr. Justice Stewart, counsel

18

stated that the decree here did not prohibit all picketing

20

here.

21

decree does accept that.

22
23
24
25

We can still picket at the reserve gate.

We can, the

The evidence is also admitted by stipulation that
that reserve gate is not enforced, people go in there who are
not FEC people and FEC people go in other places so the
reserve gate we say is an illusory issue here.
30

i•
2

FEC comes on there so the decree here admittedly, we submit,

3

must be construed as prohibiting both primary and secondary if

4

you concede this is secondary, and we don't, picketing»

5

I

The decree does prevent us from picketing where the

Now in answer to the question from Mr. Justice

6

Black, counsel for Respondent stated that it was not determina»

7

tive here whether this picketing be deemed secondary or primary

8

and we agree with that.

9

In other words, what counsel for Respondent is saying?

10

by his answer to that question is that the States have power

11

to regulate peaceful orderly picketing in the railroad industry

12

regardless of whether it is secondary or not secondary so we

13

say the whole question here about whether this picketing is

14

secondary or not is really a question only designed to appeal

15

to the emotions.

16

In short, we say that if this picketing is to be

17

called secondary it is not outlawed by the controlling law, we

18

say it is not secondary and we say that regardless of whether

19

you call it secondary or not it certainly is not irresponsible

20

conduct; it is conduct which was designed by us to limit as

21

closely as we could the affect of this peaceful economic action

22

to the party that we have the dispute with, the FEC,

23

And, in that regard, I would like to correct, if I

24

may, what was referred to in Respondent's brief as an inad­

25

vertent implication on our part.
31

It was not an inadvertent

i

s

implication.

Footnote 12, page 10 of the brief, Respondent says

that we inadvertently imply that we had proposed ways to limit
this picketing to make adjustments.
In other words, to that this picketing would be
limited to only FEC movements.

Now it should be remembered

that the picketing began in the early morning hours and that
within hours after that, everybody responsibly concerned with
it was in court trying a Federal court case on a 33RO and the
TRO issue that afternoon, so that the picketing here only went
on a few hours.
At page 264, when that injunction was lifted we
stated on the record in this case our willingness to make any
kind of adjustment possible and the railroads stated that it
was possible to do so.
Thank you.
(Whereupon, at 1;Q0 p.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
