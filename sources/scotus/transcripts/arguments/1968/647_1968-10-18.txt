ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES MORGAN, JR., ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

8
9

MR. MORGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, life have behind us a copy of the Alabama ballot.

10

it appears in the

II

record, Exhibit G to the Amos deposition.

12

13
14

As

record, this is a reproduction from the

You will notice there are seven columns on the
ballot with an. eighth coluim for the independents over here.
In column 1 you have eight electors only.

Column 1

15

is Alabama Independent Democratic Party, a political party

16

that was established in its certificate of incorporation

17

states that the party shall have no members and secondly

18

states in its certificate of incorporation the party shall

19

run no candidates for office for local, state or national

20

offices except for presidential electors.

21

This party has been described by Defendant Amos.

22

Defendant Amos is herself

23

on column number 3. as a party within a party.

24
25

a presidential elector candidate

By voting on column 1 a voter casts his ballot
for the Humphrey-Muskie ticket for president.
1

1

By voting column numbe4 3 he votes the straight

2

Democratic ticket in the State of Alabama and thereby cases

3

his ballot for George Cory Wallace for President.

4

Q

How many electors are there in Alabeuna?

5

A

Ten electors.

8

Q

There are only 0 in column 1.

7

A

Wo, sir, there are 10, and in this column,

8

column 3 and column 7 and also column 5 which is the Repub­

9

lican Party.

10

In Alabama a voter if he votes the straight Demo­

Ii

cratic ticket votes for all the local nominees of the Demo­

12

cratic Party right down through Bull Connor and others all

13

of the way down the line.
If he votes a straight Republic ticket, he votes,

14
15

of course, for Mr. Nixon and Mr. Agnew, and all of the way

16

down the line he votes for the Republican nominees.

17

If he votes this ticket, the National Democratic

18

Party of Alabama, for appellants here, he votes a straight

19

party ticket for electors pledged to Humphrey-Muskie unless

20

disavowed by them and, of course,this has not occurred.
He also votes a straight party ticket down the

21

22

line in those counties for which candidates appear for this

23

party.

24
25

Q

Those electors in that column are not the same

as the candidates Humphrey-Muskie in column 3?
2

A

No Huinphrey-Muskie are in column 3.

In column

1, no* they are not.
We have entered into a stipulation with the Chairman
of this political party and under Alabama law a political
party can replace vacancies which refill vacancies with others.
In the event Section 148 of the Alabama statute*
Title 17* which prohibits people from appearing under more
than one ballot emblem in the same election* that* in the
event that is stricken down* these electors will be removed
by the party* these will be retained, and these electors
will then move over so there will be no dilution of the
Humphrey-Muskie slate,
Q

Can they be active?

A

They can be if the courts allow them as a

form of remedy in the District Court or if so instructed here.
There is no physical problem with that.
Q

We got this paper so recently I must say I

don't have it in mind* but I understood there was some Ala­
bama law

to that effect.
A

Section 148 simply prohibits them from appear­

ing on the ballot twice and that is the principal statute*
as I understand it* that would prevent them from being aggre­
gate.

We could trim that statute with this particular election

It is.certainly unconstitutional in its application.

Q

Edward F. Mauldin?

A

Edward F. Mauldin says that these electors

should be removed and these should be left on the ballot.
David J. Vann who is Chairman of this party says
that in the event that statute is struck down or inapplicable,
these electors would not withdraw from the place on this
ballot here.
Q

Say that again.

A

Mr. Vann who is chairman of this party, who

was represented in court and it is in the record, says that
these parties will not withdraw these electors if placed on
the ballot under this ticket.
Now, you have a second provision of the Alabama
4

5

statute which says that a person has the right to vote a

2

straight party ticket.

that.

has been determined as of November 1, 1964 to be such.

Two provisions of law would provide

We believe that under the Voting Rights Act, the

20

15th Amendment, and otherwise, folks have a right to vote a

21

straight party ticket, and they have a right to have candidates

22

on the ballot.

23

We also believe the record in this case clearly dis­

24

closes the motive and the reason for the disqualification of

25

this party in column number 7.

Now, this is not a separatist party; this is an in­
tegrated party.

3

Q

(Inaudible)

4

A

I think only in an ancillary way.

We can

5

test the others.

Well, I am not making it directly but I

6

am going to tie it back in a moment to the Garrett law under

7

which we are disqualified and the Corrupt Practices Act under

8

which they say we are disqualified—I can’t understand that

9

myself—and to tie this back to that to show the confusing

10

nature of the ballot and then move it forward so that the

11

whole procedure looks like a test of the device and certainly

12

those statutes are.

13

Now, what we contend with respect to this ballot

14

is that in the event this ticket is not on the ballot, the

15

State Democratic Party which will be carried by the Wallace

16

electors, ifat all, will then have tapped into the political

17

system from which Negroes have been excluded for 100 years,

18

the Negro vote, and we think the record amply discloses the

19

way this whole procedure came about.

Q

What was the form of interim order you initially

21

got from the three-judge court?

Nothing; it put us on the ballot.

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

If you were entitled to relief which resulted

3

in shifting that column electors, what would this mean.

4

Would you have to do all of the voting machines and ballots

5

over again?

6

A

I really think not.

You see, it is very con-

:

7

fusing.

As the Secretary of State stated herself, she

a

didn't quite know when was the last day she could print

9

ballots and depositions.
Q

10
1i

If that is the relief you want and could get

it, is that the kind of change that would have to be made?
A

12

I think if the ballots are already printed

13

that would be the case, but I don't think the ballots have

14

been printed.
Q

15
1G

What happened after you got your interim

relief putting you on the ballot?
A

17

They may have printed absentee ballots.

18

State would know more about that than I do, but I don't

19

believe that they have.

right now.

It is either new ballots for the first time,

if you prevail, ballots which shift column 1 electors over
to column 7.
A

Yes, sir, and if that doesn't happen, we want

the column 7 electors to stay on there as they are now.

The

1

Vice President and Mr. Muskie have made no election not to

2

appear on the ballot under this ticket.
Q

3

Doesn't that mean if it just the way it is,

4

with two separate sets of electors, that puts the Humphrey-

5

Muskie ticket at a rather disadvantage?

6

A

Yes, sir, in Alabama it would.

7

Q

Because you can't activate the votes for them.

8

A

The candidates8 names don't appear on the

9

ballot themselves.

But what we contend, of course, is that

10

that can be done and that it can

11

easily, and it could be done with an order in order to aggre­

!2

gate the votes.

They need two things.

First of all, they need

the right to vote a straight party ticket and, then, secondly,
they need somebody to vote for, and the Secretary of State
hasn't gien them that and neither does the District Court
order.
Now, what happened was, along about August 14,

As Mr. Pollack stated the other day, Alabama

25

has asked for approval of the Attorney General and only one

it was.

have to do beyond that such as file a notice when the Secre­

tary of State says she is not going to put you on the ballot.

23

We say she should first hold the period.

25

point is the District Court on the 16th as I recall it held

3

On the 17th. for the first time, the State Attorney

4

General comes along and says, "Hark, none of your candidates

5

have signed these declarations."

6

Now, 30 to 35 of them did it because they did

7

file applications regardless of, you know, what has been

8

stated here and they are contained on the same form.

9

That is why everybody else filed them because the form was

10

made out that way.
What happens then is we are in open court.

11

They

12

then raise that question and say none of your candidates can

13

appear!, and we look up and say, "Okay, we are not candidates

14

to the District Court.

Enter the temporary restraining order.'

15

No matter what you say, we couldn't have been.

16

We immediately filed in the Court a certificate

17

of compliance and Judge Johnson says—and it is not our

18

phrase; it is the defending Judge Johnson's phrase—they are

19

disqualifying this whole slate by an afterthought and they

20

are doing it by a document filed in Federal Court.

:

She started with two reasons.

21

She lost on one

22

of those.

Now she has one new reason and she is applying

23

the Corrupt Practices Act and it looks to us like a clearly

24

YickWosituation because it has never been enforced by the

25

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Redden

ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. DREW REDDEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. REDDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court-Q

At the outset, tell us what the situation

is with respect to the preparation and distribution of
ballots o
A

The probate judges in the various counties

are charged with the preparation of the ballot in their
particular county.
I think the Court will readily understand, as
has been pointed out, this is not a complete ballot and
the ballots will vary from county to county because of
the fact that there are local and county offices up for
election during 1968 so that on the ballot in each county
you would have your state-wide offices.

You would only

have one of these candidates for Congress.

We have eight

congressional districts in the appropriate districts so
that you would have a different ballot in each county.
Q

Is there only one ballot?

A

If I understand the question, there is only

one ballot in each county.
Q

But each one is different?

A

Each one is different as it would be in any
18

1

State in the Union.
To answer your question, I would have to say

2
3

that you would not have a uniform situation with reference

4

to the degree of preparation of the ballot from county to

5

county.
Q

6
7

Do we have information on what each probate

court judge did when the order came down?
I

A

8

I have some hearsay information solely.

9

Remember, that in portions of the State on voting machines

10

these have been prepared in a great many cases, I am sure,

11

following the District Court’s order.

12

stances, the ballots are being printed by printers at

13

the order of the probate judge.

14

right now.

15

In some other in­

There is no uniformity

They are in various stages of preparation.
Q

Is that to say to the extent that ballots

16

are being prepared, whether they are printed ballots or

17

voted on voting machines, they comply with that interim

18

order and includes the column 7?

19
20

21

A

No, sir, I would have to say a good many

do not; that probably more do not than do.
We have made contact since the Court entered

22

the order here with as many as we have been able to contact

23

to advise them of the issues of this order and to have them

24

to undertake to do whatever they can do with regard to

25

trying to wait and trying to find a printer who can put
- 19 -

1

them in a position of compliance.

2

Really, we are getting very cloee to the election

3

and I am sorry that I am unable to tell the Court precisely

4

what the situation is in each county.

5

Q

Eighty-two counties?

6

A

7

Might I state one thing at the outset.

Sixty-seven.
I have

8

been requested by counsel for the intervener who was not

9

allotted any time for making a presentation simply to

state to the Courtthat a brief has been filed on behalf
of the intervenors, to state that the issues raised by
the intervenors apply only to the presidential electors;
not to the local offices; that they are in accord with the
decision ofthe court below in favor of the appellees here
but they desire me only to make the further representation
to the court that they consider that their intervention
raises issue which were not disclosed below because it was
unnecessary to reach them because of the decision.
Q

The Attorney General did not in the tele­

gram sent to this court assert that it would be impossible
to comply with the order if it were entered granting the
relief requested?
A

That is my understanding.

Q

Are you now saying that compliance would be

impossible?
20

1
A

I would not represent that to the court.

2
I would say the officials would make every effort to comply
3
with any order of this court.

I don't make an assertion that

4
it is an impossibility.

X would like to reply directly to some of the

6
points raised here.

In the first place, the Corrupt Practices Act of
the State of Alabama has been the law of that State for 53
years.

The two sections under attack by the appellants in

this case have not had any substantial change throughout that
long period of time.

The portion with which they failed to

comply was a provision of that law which states that within
five days after the announcement of a candidacy that the
candidate is required to file a designation of a committee
to receive contributions to handle its funds.

The rest of

the lav; imposes a considerable obligation on those individuals.
It may be the candidate himself, it may be persons he desig­
nates, but the law imposes a considerable obligation on them
with reference to the receipt of funds, the disbursement of
funds and ultimately the accounting for funds.
The second section they attack contains a mandatory
provision if a

candidate fails to comply with that provision

his name will not appear on the ballot.

24

Nov;, it is that simple---

25

Q

Mr. Redden, in Alabama do the candidates for

21

1

electors run a campaign that costs money?

2

A

That costs money?

3

Q

Yes »

4

A

They frequently have, yes, sir.

5

Q

I am talking about just for their one position

6

as

one of the electors»

7

A

Generally I would say that the expenditure

8

of funds has been on a concerted basis, if I understand the

9

question»

to
11

12

Q

But there is no question the Corrupt Practices

Act does apply to a candidate to be an elector?
A

Wo, sir, there is no question»

There are

13

provisions, of course, governing all offices with reference

14

to the amount of money that can be expended in particular

15

races for particular

16

out any question»

purposes.

It does apply to them with­

'17

But there was not compliance with this in the main.

18

As counsel have stated, there were some few who

19

filed a form that was printed for this party»

At the head

20

of it, it contains the statement, "Declaration of Intent,

21

Act No. 243, Nations! Democratic Party of Alabama."

22

a prepared form.

23

of all of the requirements of the Garrett Act; that he was

aware of the requirements of the Corrupt Practices Act; that

25

he disseminated the information concerning the necessary

Now, the complaint is made that the Secretary c£

Act, but I would ask the court to consider it in relation
to the Garrett lav/ also.

9
10
11

You are being asked to consider the Garrett Act
as an isolated piece of legislation, selected solely for
the purpose of disqualifying candidates for office.

12
ro

£-4>

I point this out to the court, and what I

I submit to the court that this is not the
situation.

It is part of an integrated portion, statutes
i

14
15

concerning declarations of candidacy and qualifications.
For example, for, I believe, 30 years, those

16

persons who wished to qualify as candidates for parties

17

conducting primaries have been required to do so by March 1st

TG

of the year of the election — everyone.

19

the Garrett Act is to say that an independent candidate for

20

The only effect of
li

office or a candidate for office of a party not conducting
]

21

22

a primary must file a declaration of intent by the same day.
Now, this cannot be equated in my judgment with what

23

this court struck down in Rhodes.

24

recall the facts, attaining 430,000 names would have had to

25

be signed and presented by February 7, 90 days ahead of the
23

There, a petition, as I

1

2

primary.
What has to happen

here is that every person who

3

desires to be a candidate for office in Alabama must by

4

March 1 file a declaration of intent»

5

be supported; it is not a petition containing signatures»

6

It is his statement and it applies to everyone»

It does not have to

7
Q

When are the primaries held by the Democratic

8
Party and the Republican Party?
9

A

The first Tuesday in May,

Q

So, in effect, the result of this would be it

10
11

would make it impossible for someone to submit his name to
'i 2

one of the qualified parties if he is defeated later»
13

A

Unless he was nominated from a convention

14

that had chosen delegates on the primary election day.
15

Q

You couldn't do that»

As a practical matter,

16

here is Mr. X and he says he is going to make a run for it to
1?

get the nomination of the Democratic Party or the Republican
18

Party, and he fails, and then he wants to run as an inde­
19

pendent or some other party nominates him.

That is impossible

20

under your law.
21

A

I would say it v/ould be one instance in

22
which it would be possible.

Let me carry a step further the

23

statutory provision.
24

As I stated, everyone regardless of whether he
25

desires to run as a candidate in a primary or non-primary party
-

24

-

must declare by March 1,
The statute further provides whatever form of
nomination is utilised,, that must be accomplished on the
first Tuesday in May»
For example, Mr. Justice Fortas referred to the
Democratic and Republican Parties conducting primaries.
The fact is the Republican Party conducts primaries in only
two or three counties.

It nominates by mass meetings.

The law states they shall be oral rallies or
caucuses, or whatever they are called, and the primary is
held on the same date that the Republicans go through the mass
meeting in their nomination procedure on that date.
I say there would be a real possibility for this

reason, that a party might at that time that is on the first
Tuesday in May elect its delegates to a state convention,
for example, that would meet for the prupose of nominating
candidates.

I would have to acknowledge, I believe, that

he probably would hare lost his right to some degree to run
for a county office.

There would still be powers available

to him and conceivably if they simply elected delegates to a
nominating convention at the county level, that would still
be open to him.

That would be the degree to which they are

open „
So, on May 7th, the nominations are made or dele­
gates are elected to conventions.
25

This is required of everyone
-

1

There is no distinction.

If a man is an independent candi­

2

date the petition it requires him to submit is not required

3

to be submitted on March 2nd»

It must be submitted by May 7th,

4

When was that legislation adopted?

All of the legislation I am speaking of with

or longer.

date back to 1931, I believe, as a date of origin,

9

Q

What about the March provision?

IO

A

The March provision changing the date from

11

May for those who were not candidates in a primary to March

12

was enacted in 1967 effective in May perhaps of the following

13

year,

Q

There was no attempt to comply with Section 5

of the Voting Rights Act?
A

It was not submitted, of course, and I am

using this example showing that this is only a part of the
law, but the Corrupt Practices Act, of course, had been the
law, as I said, since 1915,
Going forward with the dates and actions synchronized,
May 7th, the certifications of the nominations which were made
on May 7th or by nominating conventions held subsequent to
May 7th through delegates elected on that date must be sub­
mitted 60 days prior to the election.
One thing Mr, Morgan has pointed out is this: that
-

26

1

Mrs. Amos , the Secretary of State, he says, as an afterthought--

2

as an afterthought~-you also failed to comply with the Corrupt

3

Practices Act of the State of Alabama.

4

I do make this observation to the Court.

There

5

were 67 other defendants in the case below.

/

people who were required to file with Mrs. Amos, the Secretary

8

of State, at all were the candidates for state-wide office.

The only

Now if we assume that it would be valid to state

10

that Mrs. Arnos as an afterthought said by the way you did not

11

comply with the Corrupt Practices Act, which I submit she

12

had a perfect right to do, that statement has not been made

r

*-\

of the 67 probate judges.

There is no contention they have

14

said anything that estops them which says you must comply

15

with that law or you cannot be on the ballot if you have not

16

complied with the Corrupt Practices Act.

17

simple as that.

10

Q

It is just as

If Alabama had not adopted the Garrett law,

19

do I understand you to say by May 7th either party must on

20

that date decide on conventions and then turn up with some

21

means before the election-—-

22

A

Must certify them.

23

Q

If one is an independent, what does he do?

■r\ A.

A

The satae thing.

25

Q

So, if you did not have the Gannett Law or the

Act applies just at one end,

anything?

6
7

There were meetings of five people, six people in various

8

counties, and that really is not an issue here in this case

9

that they made certain nominations.

10

We have 67 counties and, as counsel has stated to

11

you, what they are stating, for example, with reference to

12

the straight ticket argument is that these people have a

13

right to have a straight ticket vote available to them.

14

is simply this:

State because there are 67 counties.

4

Q

That would relate to all of the other ones?

5

A

On,* two in four more, and a couple more.

6

Let's follow this just a minute, the argument

7

that there is a right to vote a straight ticket.

S
9

I do respectfully call the Court's attention to
the statutes cited in the Appendix of our brief.

They are

10

referring to Title 17 of the Code of Alabama.

11

"The electors, if desired" — I believe those are the words

12

of the statute — "may vote a straight ticket by marking it at

0O

the top of the ballot.

i.-'.v

14

It says,

But reading 158, 159, 160 and 162, the next one

15

says if he wants, he may vote a split ticket by marking in

16

any fashion that he chooses»

17

The next one says in a case where he wants to

18

vote a straight ticket, and there are blanks in the column

19

of that party, he can vote the straight ticket, and then he

20

can go and fill in those blanks, his ballot and his machine

2?

will still be open to vote for the candidates of other parties

22

where

23
24

candidates, and this is provided for.
i
So, we state to the court that effective participation

25

in this election would require that the vote under some other

the party that he wants to support supports all of the

29

1

2

labels, too.
I think that the ballot here is not unique.

It is

3

not even unusual.

4

from state to state,, but there is no device here to confuse.

5

I don't really understand the argument that says on the one

6

hand you wouldn't let us on the ballot so our people can vote

7

a straight ticket*

8
9
10

I guess the format of a ballot could vary

16

to declare Section 148, Title 17 unconstitutional, and we

n

want you to do it so that these candidates for election can

18

withdraw and this party can thereby substitute these people

19

for refusing to certify because of the lack of a mass meeting

Q

Then it is out of this case.

A

It is out of this case.

Ism reciting a

chronology for this reason that the last nominations made
would have been made on July 7th and the earlier ones
on May 7th.

There was no certification of any candidates

to the Secretary of State or to probate judges until certi™
fications were

mailed apparently almost to every one of

them from Huntsville on September 4, 1968, arriving in the
office of the probate judges and the Secretary of State on
September 5, 1968, at the last possible moment.

13

Q

14

A

They were within the 60 days — just barely.

Q

From what date would the Corrupt Practices Act

'15

16

Were they timely?

j

apply within 5 days?
f

17

18

A

This is the point I was getting to.

If they

maintained that there had been no announcement until that

19

moment of candidacy established on May 7, for example, they

20

did not comply because they did not file their designation of

21

committee within five days of that time.

22

that even as to state-wide candidates nominated, they say on

23

July 20, if they maintain that there was no announcement

24

because they kept it apparently pretty quiet, that there

25

was no announcement of those candidacies of those people
34

If they maintain

!

nominated on July 20th, until they filed -these papers, they
didnst satisfy it then.
The Supreme Court of Alabama has held in a case
where a candidate declared or made public by filing this
paper on May 3, the first Tuesday of the month, was nominated
in that case, that that was the time of the announcement
of his candidacy.

That was the time of his announced candidacy

when the time began to run for him.
I say if is only to assert that the things this
party did were done relative to nomincitions either on May 7
or July 30 or September 5.
Q

In the action of September 5, was the
.

Corrupt Practices Act amplified or complied with?
A

No, it was not.

Remember, I have acknowledged

at the outset there were a few who utilized the form printed
by their party and distributed to them.

There were a few

who signed the designation of financial committee and filed it
with the declaration of intent.
Q

What do you say to the claim that there has

been discriminatory enforcement of that provision?
A

I say that is not correct, and I say that it is

not supported by the record in this case.
I say further that the only testimony in this
case with reference to its utilization and its enforcement is
the stop of Judge Paul Meeks who is the judge of probate of

county in the State and has a population of approximately
800,000 people.

his office for this election.

in Alabama, and I submit this rule has been approved by

9

the Fifth Circuit at least in a statement that this is a

13

matter of state law after constitutional violation.
Q

There have been people

excluded from the

ballot because of non-compliance?
A

Yes, sir, and in addition to that there have

14

been cases where a probate judge would request an opinion

15

of the Attorney General concerning whether a particular

16

person should be placed on a ballot.

17
18
19

Q

Do you understand the party to make any claim

that whichever date you have there has been any compliance?
A

The only compliance they claim to have made

20

is that in this lawsuit and about the 20th day of September,

21

and this is as close as I can take it -- and I am sure counsel

22

will correct it if I am wrong ■—• it would be no earlier than

23

the 18th or 19th or 20th that there was an attempt in this

Q

As I understand it, if the restraining order

17

stays in its present posture, you would have on your ballot

18

two sets of presidential electors composed of different

19

people but each of them pledged to Humphrey and Muskie?

20

Two sets?

Yes t and then you would have a third set

I understand your argument is under Section 148 that that
is prohibited because you cannot have the same name for more
than one office, or would it be for the same office, but the
office of elector, but would that violate Section 148?
A

Yes, sir, it says the name cannotappear on

the ballot but only one name and counselsays

When you contest the point that the statement was

Yes, sir, Mrs. Amos---

Q

Wait just a minute.

Do you contest the point that such a statement was
not filed within the five days after the first announcement
of candidacy for these offices?
A

Yes, sir.

Tell me why, and remember I talk in terms of

the statute language for the announcement of the candidates.

That is not what the statute says,

The statute says five days after the announce­

ment of candidacy, which could be March 1,
Q

7

This has been construed by theSupreme Court

of Alabama to mean the filing of the certificate of nomination

by either mass meeting or by convention held after mass

meeting.

11

Do you concede that the required statement

12

of the committee was not filed within five days after the

filing of that certificate of nomination?
A

(Mr, Morgan)

We do concede it was not filed

except with respect to certain candidates.

days after that date?

How do you justify that one?

Yes, sir, which is September 6.

Q

You never said anything about whether a

A

Nobody ever tried this.

is a mystery to me.

with the statute.

say Dane Mill and other cases including the Alabama Welfare

all, they say after five days we have an Alabama case which

Now, if you were going to file, why did you not file
within five days?

That is the part that worries me.

Is that an argument, Mr. Morgan, that i*eally

16

is sought to be treated as if the date of filing was the date

17

the court placed you on the ballot?

The date of filing under Alabama law is the 5th

but we say Mrs. Amos misinterpreted our statutory period when

she said we couldn't get on.

Alabama statutes that say if you don't even file the list of
