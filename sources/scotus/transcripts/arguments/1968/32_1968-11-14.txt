MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

No. 32, Gale H. Johnson,

Petitioner, versus John E. Bennett, Warden, Iowa State Peni| tentiary.

Mr. Carlson, you may continue with your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. CARLSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER (Resumed)
MR. CARLSON;

Thank you very much, your Honor.

May it please the Court, your Honors at the con­

|

clusion of remarks yesterday, counsel had mentioned that the

| Iowa State Penitentiary at Fort Madison had, prior to my
client's trial, become the focus of investigation by the
,■

| Prosecuting Attorney's Office.

He had interviewed prisoners

there about what they might know about MR. Johnson, what they
; had been able to find out, and so forth.
Two prisoners ultimately came up with a report of
admissions made by Mr. Johnson to this offense, oral admis­
sions, as well as notes which were introduced at the trial
as State's Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2.

These notes sought to

portray the prisoner in this case as a man seeking to cook
up an alibi.

The prisoners said they got the notes when my

client was trying to smuggle them outside the penitentiary.
These notes were also validated at trial by a handwriting
expert called by the State.

This handwriting expert said

Mr. Johnson, who was required to print

his

handwriting on

an exemplar card, was the same man who printed the note.
In about 1960, Mr. Johnson was able to send these
12

three exhibits to a handwriting expert who is the leading
authority on this subject.

This man made a detailed exam­

ination of the handwriting on the exemplar card, the detail
of the analysis appearing on the two notes, and he concluded
that the original trial testimony was completely wrong; that
the notes were not written by Mr* Johnson; that they were
apparently forged notes.
Q

Are those the notes that were reproduced in

the appendix?
A

They are printed in the appendix, your Honor,

but not in this form.

They do appear with the .exhibits we

have sent to the Court, however.
Q

Mr. Carlton, this issue of handwriting came

up at the trial, did it not, the original trial?
A

Yes, sir, it did, although for reasons I

will mention we were not able to present . any handwriting
of significance of cur own.
Q

At the original trial, there was a handwriting

analysis?
A

Yes, sir, and that was presented by the State.

Q

What are the samples that were used at that

A

The sample used was a printed card which was

introduced in evidence.
Q

Ware the same documents compared at the

Honor .

Yes, sir, and that is very important, your

Our sample is the 1934 handwriting sample used at

Mr. Johnson°s trial.

Yes, a Mr. Faxon was called by the State.

Q

the same, did he?
A

Yes, he did, your Honor.

Q

Now we have a new set of experts who 33 years

later now say no on their analysis, it is not the same; is
that right?
A

That is right.

They san the opinion at that

time was erroneous.
Q

Was there any suggestion that it was deliber-

afcely false, that the expert at that time -©stifled falsely?
A

It is perhaps significant, your Honor, in

connection with other evidence in the case, my client receivecl notice

of that about two months before trial.

Prosecution had these notes in July.
ember.

The

Our trial was in Nov­

On this evidence, notice was served six days before

the trial, not on the Petitioner's Attorney, but upon the
Petitioner in his jail cell.

He hurriedly wrote his lawyers

saying that the notes were going to be introduced.
-

I

14

-

He did not

i

even have copies.

He only had notice that this ms going to

be introduced against him.

There was .no opportunity afforded

for the defense to give this kind of evidence the necessary
kind of scrutiny to reveal its falsity.

While the notification

may have been technically correct, we question the propriety,
we question the genesis, since they were penitentiary inmates,
in not giving defense counsel a proper opportunity for scrutiny
Q

Are you suggesting that had you had roof oppor­

tunity, you might have established that the handwriting expert
indeed was not giving honest testimony?

Is that what you are

saying?
A

No, X think perhaps not, your Honor, but X

think we could establish the two prisoners were not giving
honest testimony--the ones who produced the notes—because
th© current evidence says Mr. Johnson did not produce those
notes, and X think inferentially from the record it appears
that perhaps these two prisoners who

produced them or someone

that they were working with perhaps printed them.
Q

Assuming the handwriting expert was honestly

giving his expert opinion that this was the same handwriting,
where does that leave
A

ub?

That leaves us right here, your Honor.
I think in Pyle versus Kansas the point was

made that if false evidence comes into the case, even though
the Prosecutor does not knot-? about it—
15

!

1

Q

My whole point is how are we to say it was

2

false if it was honest expert opinion based on the fact

3

that later honest experts gave testimony that it was not?

A

Then it comes down to whose opinion is correct»

these notes,

Q

You mean in effect this comes to us with

virtually a stipulation on the part of the State that these

were not written by this Defendant?

to the burdens of

the suppressed

ao

witness and what we contend is false evidence, our Petitioner

21

here was required, your Honors, to bear on further burden, and

22

that was the burden of proof on a lead issue in this case —

23
24
25

the issue of whether the prisoner was at Burlington, Iowa or
at Des Moines, 1.65 miles away, at the time of the offense.
E@ presented a strong alibi offense here.

18

He called

the owner of a gasoline station who had filled his tank in
Des Moines at the time the homicide occurred, at 165 miles
away.

He traded there about a year, and this man appeared

as an independent witness with no axe to grind.
The owner of a cigar store said that Mr. Johnson
was in his store and, had bought a cigar.
I am not asking the Court to retry the facts, but
I am raising the point that a strong alibi was presented.
Many independent witnesses placed my client at a point in
the City of Des Moines where it would have been impossible
for ray client to have committed this murder, if he had been
believed.
Witnesses ware called on this point of alibi and
the jury was instructed that in order to prevail on nonpresence at the scene, the Defendant was required to prove
by a preponderance of the evidence that he was

elsewhere.

he Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in Speiser versus
Randall, the burden of proof may well be determinative in a
given case and wa suggest, therefore, that this instruction
given by the Trial Court as well as the references by the
Prosecuting Attorney, which appear on pages 113 and 114 of
our record, were highly detrimental to our prisoner's pre­
sumption of innocense and his fair-trial rights in this ease.
It is up to the defense, the Prosecutor said, the
burden of proof of alibi, and they have to prove that, and

-

19

1

that the Court will instruct you that they have to prove

2

alibi.

3

Again, the Prosecutor said, "Are you going to

4

accept the alibi of pool-hangers-on in their relation with

5

Johnson when the man never denied it himself?

6

tells the jury, "you are entitled to what he says and the

7

burden of proof rests on the Defense, and they have to meet

that burden ."

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. CLAERHOUT, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CLAERHOUT:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court, so that the Court will have a better appreciation

9

of the rather complicated rules of lax? here involved, I would

10

like to very briefly recount the basic facts involved in this

11

case.
It began about 5:30 in the morning on May 27, 1934

12
18

when a Burlington, Iowa policeman was shot while investigating

14

a reported burglary.

15

making an identification of his assailant.

16

witnesses before the scene heard shots and heard two people

17

running from the scene.

witnesses identified very positively was the Petitioner in

13

this case.

I

I don01 know, Your Honor, whether it was light

22

or dark, but it was established it wasaboufc 5:30 or 6:00 in

23

the morning, in May, so I would speculate it would be light

24

at that time.
.

25

Nevertheless, the Petitioner was seen by -these two

14

who had seen it in Burlington.

55

It was identified by the witnesses

Although Mr. Johnson did not take the witness

16

stand, he did present at least six witnesses from Des Moines

17

who claimed that he was in Des Moines at a time when it would

18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

have been impossible for him to have also been in Burlington,
165 miles away, at the time of the murder.
Thus, the alibi proposition is raised.
There are three issues involved here, and I think-—
Q

May I ask, did the State attempt to discredit

those witnesses, his alibi witnesses?
A

Yes, your Honor.

It was a very vigorous trial

on both sides and those witnesses were attacked vigorously on

23

1

their association with the Petitioner.

2

his mother; his brother was involved, and his father.

3

they were attacked.

4
5

Q

One, I believe, was
Yes,

But there were others, were there not, like

the gasoline station man, and so forth?

0

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

Was he a close associate?

8

A

1 don't know that the record shows that they

9

were close associates.

10

11

Perhaps they knew each other, and I

believe that is as far as that went.
There are three issues involved here.

I think they

12

are very crucial issues that had been before this Court

13

before, and I will attempt to spend at least short of ten

14

minutes on each of them.

15

The first is the suppression of Witness Orsucci.

1G

The Court found Mr. Thomas Orsucci one of the 13 or 14 wit­

17

nesses requested was in the Polk County Jail and not in the

10

Clarinda Institute for the Insane, as the Deputy Sheriff had

IS

written on the subpoena return.

20

21
22

23
24
25

Q

This we do not dispute.

It also appears that he had never been in

this Clarinda Institute.
A

I believe that is a fair result, and I believe

the District Court so found.
Q

And this was the Sheriff’s Office that had

control of people in the jail?

The

2

Q

What was he in jail for?

I believe it was something like that.

people in the Polk County Jail.
Was it public

6

titioner in this case was convicted and sentenced to life

7

imprisonment.

8
3
10

11
12

A

I believe it was about December 8.

It was

within the vicinity of the time the conviction was handed
down, yes, sir.
Q

Did that sheriff testify in any of the habeas

corpus hearings that you have had since?

13

A

No, your Honor, I donst believe he has.

14

Q

Is he living?

15

A

I understand from my predecessors on this

16

case—and, of course, there have been a number—-but the immed­

17

iate, the Assistant Sheriff, the one who filled out the re­

18

turns, a man named Koons is actually deceased prior to the

19

time the matter came up for hearing in DistrictCourt.

20

Q

Hoxtf about the man who testified originally?

21

A

I am not sure whether or not, your Honor, that

22

particular sheriff testified.

I don't recall.

23

Q

Mr. Orsucci has long since been deceased?

24

A

Your Honor, he died in 1965, a short time before

25

this matter finally made it to the hearing stage in Federal

25

1

Court.

2
3

Q

These proceedings were not initiated by the

Petitioner until after Mr. Orsucci died?

4

A

There were proceedings attempted as early as

5

1948 or 1949 at about the time the Petitioner obtained an

6

affidavit

7

after he deceased.

from Mr. Orsucci.

However, no hearing was had until

8

Q

Was a hearing ever requested on that issue?

9

A

I don't believe, your Honor, that a hearing

.10

was specifically requested on the Orsucci issue.

18

and the

A hearing

was requested in District Court

District Court denied habeas corpus without a hearing?
A

Yes, your Honor.

Therewere many, many issues

before the Cpurt, and I believe that was one of them.
If I may, the rule, we think, is entirely applicable,
and we are not contesting any of this Court's rules.
I should like to quote from Brady versus Maryland3
373 U. S. page 87:

19

"The supparession by the Prosecution of evidence

20

favorable to an accused upon request violates

21

due processes where the evidence is material

22

either to guilt or punishment irrespective of

23

good faith or bad faith of the Prosecution.”

24

We submit that the Petitioner has freely admitted

j 23

the purpose for which Mr. Orsucci was going to be used; that is,
26

i

he was going to be used to impeach one of the two eye-witnesses

2

of the flight of the two people from the scene of the murder.

O

Mr. Orsucci was not going to be used to say that Mr. Johnson

4

was not the one, but he was going to be used to impeach one

5

of thos witnesses who had previously identified Mr. Orsucci

6

as being the partner of Mr. Johnson.
We think that his testimony, going by what the

7
8

Petitioner admits it was going to be, was probably not favor­

9

able to his case and, secondly, we don't think and we com­

10

pletely agree with all of the Federal Courts below, that even

11

if this testimony had

12

material to the guilt or punishment.

been presented, it would not have been

The impeachment would not have affected the very

13
14

sure testimony of the two witnesses as to the Petitioner.

15

It would only have affected the unsureness of one of the

16

witnesses.

17
18
19

Q

I gather then you make no point of the fact

that this was a sheriff of a county 165 miles away?
A

Your Honor, because it was said in Brady that

20

irrespective of good faith or bad faith of the prosecution,

21

I think the handwriting is on the wall, but I must call

22

attention of the Court to the 8th Circuit which did not reach

23

that position because it found that the testimony would not

24
25

have been material.

So, I don't think this Court really has

to go that far.

27

i

Q

1

I gather from the answer you just gave that

2

you would not think if this were a proper case for its appli-

uO

cation that that would make impossible the application of the

4

rule on sxippression.
A

5
6

I think the evidence would have to be found

material before we could arrive at that question.
Q

7
8

If a witness identified both Orsucci and John™

son, as they did in this case —- isn't that right?

8

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

And the Defense could present a witness who

15

would totally discredit that testimony so far as Orsucci was

12

concerned, do you not believe that that would have anything

13

to do with the credibility of that witness' testimony in the

54

trial?

17
18
59
20
21

22

it would not.

23

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that
I take this position based upon the peculiar

facts of this case.

Thw two attorneys that represented the

Defendant at that trial hae been found to be very able.

A

review of the trial transcript record shows that they were
very vigorous.

They tried very hard to shake these two wit­

nesses as to their' identification of the Petitioner, and they
were steadfast.
I believe this further because I think the Defense

23
24

]
A

15
16

\

used these many witnesses, several witnesses they had as an
alibi.

I think that the impeachment would

28

have merely

amounted to one more alibi by the witness.

Therefore, I

do not think -- and 1 agree with the Court of Appeals below —that even if that testimony had been presented, it would not
have impeached the one witness, let alone both.
Q

But you dor?.' t think that if it was estab­

lished that they were entirely wrong about Orsucci in their
testimony that that would have any effect upon the correct­
ness of their identifcation of Johnson?
A

No, your Honor, for this reason:

I believe it

would have made the State's case even stronger if the wit­
ness had said, "True, I am sure

about the one man but yet I

am sure about the Defendant.
Q
that.

But they didn't say that.

They didn't say

They said both of these men were there, and the

Defendant presents a man who, let us assume, could establish
that he was not the one, the second, man, that they identi­
fied.

Do you not think that that would have a tendency to

discredit their entire testimony?
A

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, only one of the

witnesses, I believe, was going to be impeached, of course.
Q

Just stick to that one witness.

A

No, quite candidly I think that Mr. Orsucci's

involvement in this case, the possibility that maybe he was
the other witness would have been looked upon by the jury as
more favorable to the State perhaps than tc the Defendant.
-

!

29

-

I don't think impeachment of that witness could have been
maintained.
Q

But neither you nor the Court knew the witness.

You didn't see him.

You don’t know what kind of witness he

would have made.
A

No, sir.

Q

Of course, you don't.

Hox* can you predict what

effect he would have on the jury?
A

Mr. Mustice, this is exactly our point.

jury in 1934 was present.

The

They had some 43 witnesses, I

believe, to look at and they disbelieved, obviously,
Petitioner’s x^itnesses because, if they would have, they
would have found him not guilty.
Q

So, we would assume this witness would be

just as ineffective without knowing a thing about him.
A

Mr. Justice, I think we have to rely upon

what the witness said he would use this witness for.
Q

Don't you agree some witnesses are better

and more persuasive than others?
A

Very much so.

Q

So, there is no way anyone can predict what

effect he would have on that jury, is there?
A

Not with any reasonable probabilityl

it is subject to some speculation.
Q

That is what we are saying.

30

I think

1

A

I might add that much has been made about

2

whether or not this particular witness would have been favor­

3

able,

4

in 1949 from this Mr, Grsucci saying that he had evidence

5

relevant to the Defense.

6

that apparently although, of course, as we have already seen,

7

the Petitioner did try to get a hearing in Federal Court.

It is interesting tonote that an affidavit was obtained

8
9

Nothing further was ever done on

He did manage in 1961, three or four years before
Mr. Orsucci died,» to get the Court to direct a deposition be

10

taken of another witness, a Mr. Ruggles, on a perjury question.

11

Mr. Ruggles lived in California,

admission in the habeas corpus hearing, when he finally did

13

get it, he spent almost $2,000 obtaining this particular depo­

14

sition while Mr. Orsucci

15

Moines, and he admitted his brother often talked with Mr.

16

Orsucci.

17

is now claimed to be this important witness, Mr. Orsucci.

18
19

By the Petitioner's own

was not in California but in Des

Yet, no testimony was ever perpetuated from what

Q

If he had been given the hearing, Mr. Morsucci

could have been present as a witness?

20

A

That is right.

?J

Q

He could not take the deposition of Mr. Orsucci

22

23

if he was in Des Moines and subject to subpoena?
A

I don’t believe I understand.

He could have

24

taken the deposition of Mr. Orsucci in Des Moines if he

23

could take the deposition of Mr. Ruggles in California.

31

1

Q

In your state practice, can a defendant take

2

a deposition of any witness he wants whether he is subject to

3

the subpoena power or not?

4

A

I don't quite know the answer to that, Mr,

3

Chief Justice, but I do know that in the Federal District

6

Court, the Judge did or der a deposition to be taken in 1961

7

of this Mr. Ruggles.

3

Q

Ruggles was in California?

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

My point is if this could have been done with

11

regard to Mr. Ruggles under Federal law, because I believe

12

at that time the Petitioner’s attorney was from Des Moines,

13

his brother was there and so was Mr. Orsucci, so it could

14

have been accomplished relatively easily compared with the

15

other one.
Q

IS

What I am asking is this:

In a criminal case

17

or in a habeas corpus case, if the witnesses are all within

13

the jurisdiction of the Court, does the defendant have the

19

right to go out and take their depositions before a hearing

20

in court?

21

A

Quite honestly, your Honor, I don’t know.

22

One other point I will raise very quickly and then

23

on with the next, it is shown in the habeas corpus District

24

Court hearing that the Petitioner was in fact out of prison

25

for two-and-a-half or three years.

32

It appears that he walked

1

away from a prison farm in 1953 and was later recaptured in

2

1956 in Detroit, having spent most of his time in Canada.

3

We would thus submit that again if Mr. Orsucci had been as

4

important a v/itness as he is now claimed to be, perhaps the

5

Petitioner might have done something during that time.
This might also answer the question which was

6

7

raised yesterday about the parole.

3

why

'

I think the question is not

parole has not been granted but why the Governor of the
-i

9

State who is able to commute the sentence has not commuted

10

the sentence.

11

Once the sentence is commuted to a term of years, then parole

»2

thereafter could be granted,

I missed what you said at the beginning.

said this man escaped or tried to escape, the Petitioner?
A

13
13

Perhaps that had something to do with it.

in 1953.

The Petitioner walked away from a .prison farm

He admitted this during his testimony before the

Federal District Court.
Q

What were the circumstances of this murder?

It was the killing of a police captain?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

In the commission of a felony?

A

A reported burglary had brought forth several

Burlington policemen.

They surrounded the store that was

reported being burglarised and when this Captain Sauer went
to one side or the back of the store, shots were heard and he

33

1

was found wounded with shotgun wounds, and he later died, but

2

he did not testify or speak.

3
4

5
6
7

Q

So, a second-degree verdict offhand would appear

to be somewhat of a compromise verdict, would it not?
A

It

was the least of the three convictions

offered to the jury and they took that one, yes.
The false evidence which is claimed here has to do

8

with the notes which were intercepted by other prisoners,

9

presented to a prison official and made their way into the

10

11

hands of the Prosecutor.
This Court's decision in Miller versu.3 Pate — and

12

that is the "Bloody shorts" case — was completely avoided

18

by the Petitioner in his brief here until reply.

14

the rule is directly on point and it was used by the Eighth

15

Circuit, and that is this, and I quote from 386 U. S. at page 7:

16

17
18

We think

"The 14th Amendment cannot tolerate a State criminal
conviction by knowing use of false evidence."
There are two critical points which lead us to

19

believe that that particular rule does not require a finding

20

of a violation of due process here.

2!

22
23

First of all, the talsity of the notes is still a
matter of opinion.
Secondly, regardless of what, is said today, the notes

24

were before the jury in all their ramifications.

25

for both sides testified it was before the jury that perhaps

34

The witnesses

they were forged»
o

A Mr. Yates, a Defense witness, got up and gave

£4

3

very clear testimony that he did not think that the Petitioner

4

had written the notes.

S

Furthermore, the Court gave a very clear instruction

6

telling the jury that this sort of thing — and one can

7

imagine it might have been even more true in 1934 — that

8

this sort of evidence was the lowest form of evidence.

9

So, we believe that the jury was completely aware

10

of -the circumstances surrounding these notes; that it was a

It

jury determination that was made then, and the jury’s decision,

12

we are sure, even if there had been the expert testimony

13

available today, would have been relatively the same as it was

14

then.

IS

or not, but I do think that their weight was entirely decimated

16

by the instruction and by the able objections, the other able

17

witnesses presented by the Defense on this particular subject.

18

We don’t know whether the jury found they were false

Q

In the hearing below, did the State put on any

19

testimony, any expert testimony to counteract -the testimony

20

of the Petitioner that these were forged?

21

A

The expert testimony in the hearing was pre­

22

sented by the Petitioner.

The State also had expert opinion

23

testimony, but I don’t recall that the expert was there,

24

however it was, admitted at the hearing that a State expert

25

had looked at the notes and had concluded the same as the expert

for the Petitioner in 1965, I believe it was.
Q

Is this original handwriting expert who testi­

fied that these were the writing of the Defendant still living?
A

To my last knowledge which was a year or so

ago, he was in Chicago, Illinois.
Q

I wonder why the State did not use him again

to show that this was actually the handwriting of the Petitione: •j
A

Based upon what the state expert said and based

on the lapse in years, quite frankly, I don’t know why they

10

didn’t use Mr. Faxon again, but I think it was admitted by

11

the State at that hearing that a State expert had concluded

12

the same as the Petitioner’s expert.

13

Q

Does that State concede that those were forged?

14

A

No, your Honor, and I think that this is a good

13
16

point which has been raised here.
The return to an order to show cause, I believe it

17

was, the State said that based upon the testimony, it would

18

appear that the notes were wrongfully admitted.

19

we contend now that this was not an admission of falsity but

20

only the reasonable conclusion that the expert opinion in 1965

2!

was different than 'it was in 1934 and there is no showing or

22

even a hint that the 1934 examination was in any way fraudulent,

However,

23

Q

Who put on the habea corpus hearing?

24

A

It was at the end of the hearing by the

25

State’s counsel.

36

1

Q

A State expert never testified?

i-*

A

I don’t believe he ever" did testify, but it was

3
4
5
6

stated that if he did, he would testify relatively the same..
Q

If the State has put the expert on the stand,

would the State be bound by his testimony or not?
A

Ho, I don’t think so, Mr. Justice, because

7

I think -this is a jury question, and. I think in 1965 it would

8

be entirely proper, based merely upon expert testimony, to

9

usurp the jury function and state beyond what the jury had in

10

11

n
13
14

1934 that these notes were false.
Q

Mr. Claerhout, what about. Respondent’s Exhibit

No. 2 on page 128?
A

That is your exhibit, .is it not?

Yes, sir, this v;as the letter that I believe

I referred to.

15

Q

You did put it in evidence?

IS

A

Yes.

17

In conclusion on that point, We think the Petitioner

There is not question about that.

10

received due process by protection of the jury, and we think

19

that this would be the same in 1968 as it was in 1934.

20

Finally, the alibi instruction——

21

Q

Before you get to that, just on what Justice

22

Marshall has presented to you, tftis is almost a clear con­

23

cession that these notes were not the documents written by

24

the Petitioner? is that correct?

25

A

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, based on expert

37

-

t

opinion, this is all we have to go on, yes.

2

Q

It says, "Examination has been made of the above-

3

described material as requested and we have compared the known

4

specimen of printing with the two items in question.

5

has been concluded and it is the opinion of the examiner that

6

Gale Johnson, whose known printing appears on specimen K-l,

7

is not responsible for the printing cn specimens Q-l and Q-2,"

8

and that is signed by the Director of the Ohio Bureau, Criminal

9

Investigation Division, and you vouched for that in putting it

It

10

into evidence, so the State does vouch for the fact that this

11

is not the handwriting of the Petitioner; isn't that correct?
A

12

If this is considered an admission, I don't

think the State can admit to such a thing on mere expert

13

J4

opinion.

I think it ought to be more-—

15

Q

What more could they have than expert opinion?

16

A

I think if the man who actually authored the

17

note stepped forward and said, ”1 did those" and not the

18

Petitioner, I think the State then would be in a position that

19

it would have to admit that they were not.
What it is doing hare, if it were to admit, is taking

20
21

the jury function, but the point is, Mr. Chief Justice, the

22

jury was well-informed of all of this, we think, everything

23

short of expert opinion to the contrary in 1934.
Q

24

Your basic point is that even accepting all

of this there was no knowing use of false evidence?

25

38
1

i
2
3
4

A

No, knowing use by the Prosecutor or anyone

else in the State.
Q

Do you mean the very maximum offense could be

claimed the expert for the State in 1934 was mistaken?

5

A

1 think so.

6

Q

If he was mistaken, it was an honest mistake?

7

A

I think that is a reasonable conclusion.

8

Q

You don't doubt that the evidence o f these

9

two notes was highly prejudicial to the Defendant?

10

A

If they

were believed.

11

Q

You say

they were believed.

12

A

No, I say they probably were not believed in

13

1934 because of the strong case the Defense took against

14

them, even presenting a witness who claimed the Petitioner

15

had not written them, and he thought they had been forged.

1G

Q

That was an unexpert witness

17

A

This is

whosaid

true, but, again, Ithink

it wasn't?

the Court's

18

instruction to the jury reduced their credibility greatly by-

10

saying these are the lower forms of evidence and the jury

20

should take great care

21

in looking at them.

Fianllv, on the alibi issue, there are three posi­

22

tions involved: one of the majority of the Iowa Supreme Court,

23

one of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in overruling Stump,

24

and then there is an intermediate position.

25

The three positions are unwise instruction and

39

1

unconstitutional.

2

The tofcher is unwise but not unconstitutional.

3

The

bird is wise and constitutional.

4

Q

What is the third opinion?

3

A

There are three levels„

6

Q

What level is the third one?

7

A

The third one, your Honor, is the present view

8
9

of the majority of the Iowa Supreme Court.
We submit that Chief Judge Van Oosterhout's opinion

10

below and his dissent in the Stump versus Bennett case are

11

indeed the wisest of all positions.

12

Q

13

A

Unwise but constitutional?
1 think the handwriting is on the wall even

14

before the Iowa Supreme Court after reading their Carter Case

13

that perhaps it is not the best but wouldn’t go so far as to

16

say it was unconstitutional for the reasons, of course, set

17

forth in our brief and for the same reasons this Court found—

18

Q

You can finish your statement.

19

A

——for the same reason this Court found the

20

insanity instruction that was required to be proven beyond a

21

reasonable doubt was not violative cf due process in Leland

22

versus Oregon.

23

Q

How old is the Petitioner now?

24

A

I understand the Petitioner was born in 1905.

13

on the jury, but this overlooks the fact that we were not able

much more persuasive at the time of the original trial.

This is why I mentioned Pyle versus Kansas.

In that case , the lower courts have all taken the position

7

My mind is not at all clear on this question

of perjured testimony getting in, whether it is in fact false

or perjured. Are you suggesting wherever it is established,

11

falsity, that that ought to be a rule which requires the up­

setting of a conviction?

I am suggesting there is evidence in this
