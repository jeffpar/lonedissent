THE CLERK:

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr, Nagin,

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L, NAGIN, ESQ,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

0

MR, NAGIN:

Mr, Chief Justice, this case is here on

10

a V7rit of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of

11

Appeals for the District of Columbia, which reversed the

12

District Court dismissal of the complaints of respondents.

13

The Decision of the Court of Appeals required that

14

the District Court restrain the operation by petitioner under

IS

a concession granted by the Secretary of the Interior, of a

18

mobile interpretive service on the Mall, in the District of

17
18

10

Columbia, until petitioner secured a Certificate of Convenience |
and Necessity from WMATC, the Washington Metropolitan Area
Transit Commission, a local agency created by an interstate

20

compact between the States of Maryland, Virginia, and District

21

of Columbia.

22

23
24

25

,

In a mobile interpretive service, which is a term
we are going to be using throughout this proceeding, the
s
purpose of this kind of a service is to provide essentially
the same type of narrative, guided tour as the Park Service,
3

1i

which of course is a department within the Interior Department,

1

provides to visitors of National Parks across the country.

3

Except that instead of providing the service on. a tour which

4

goes on foot, the Secretary has determined that it would be.

S

appropriate to provide it in this instance by using motorised

6

trams, which would move at speeds not to exceed ten miles an

7

hour to the points of interest, and around the points of

8

interest, permitting the tour to go an.

9

The principal issue in the case is whether the opera­

10

tion of such a mobile interpretive service by the Secretary

11

through a concessionnaire is subject to the certification and

12

regulatory requirements of WMATC.

13

by the Secretary of the Interior is subject to WMATC juris­

14

diction, then even though the Secretary has determined that

15

there is a need for the service on the Mall, WMATC would not

16

be allowed to permit the service to be conducted unless it,

17
18
.19

i
If the operation proposed
i
I

WMATC, the local agency, determined that there was a. need.
Furthermore, WMATC would have the obligation to
determine that petitioner was qualified to render this service, l

20

even -though the Secretary had made the same determination, and

21

if the Certificate of Convenience and Necessity were granted,

22

the local agency would also have the responsibility to supervise)?
S

.

23
24

23

under its general regulatory powers, the operations of this
concession on the Mall.
The setting of the case, the actual physical 'setting

4

?

3

of the case, takes place on the Mall of the District of Columbia,

2

and when 1 use'the term "Mall", I am using it a little bit

3

generally, because it embraces park areas that are adjacent to

4

the Mall, such as the Jefferson Memorial, the Elipse, but these

5

are areas all within the exclusive charge and control of the

0

Secretary of the Interior»

7

1 think perhaps the bast description of the Secretary's

e

responsibilities in this area is set forth in Sections 1 and 3

3

of Title 16, United States Code.

It says:

"The Secretary is

10

charged with the obligation to preserve, by such means and

II

measures as conform to the fundamental purpose of said parks,

12

and which purpose is to conserve the scenery and natural histori;

13

objects and the wildlife therein" — which I guess on the Mall

14

15
IS
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

would probably be limited to squirrels — "and to provide for
the enjoyment of same in such manner and by such means as will

j

leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."
In line with this responsibility, the Secretary
determined that the facilities on the Mall, the interpretive
facilities on the Mall were already crowded to the point where
both because of population pressures and vehicular pressures,
he could no longer provide adequately for the visitor interpre­
tive services which he wished to provide under his charge of
responsibilityo
Using the authority conferred upon him by Title 16,
including Section 13 and Section 20, the Secretary requested
5

j

3

proposals from private concessionaires to operate an interpretive

2

service on the Mali, and a number of private persons responded,

3

including Petitioner, and including Respondent;; D.C. Transit,

4

with proposals»
The proposal of petitioner was selected»

S

The Director,

6

of the Park Service, Mr» Hertzog, stated that he felt the

1

proposal by the Petitioner provided the "best means of inter™

8

pretation and operation»"

S

most about petitioner was its "interpretive qualifications,”

He also stated what impressed him

The Secretary and the Petitioner entered into a

10

n

contract, in March of 1967, which called for the rendition of

12

this interpretive service».,' The contract specified that

13

the service to be provided on motorized trams, that each tram

14

would be manned by a deiver and by a guide.

15

interpretor, would use a prepared script, approved by the

IS

Secretary in interpreting the Mall, because he felt that, and

1,7

expressly provided for in the contract, that interpretation,

m

the narration part of the service, was a prime consideration»
Q

25

We don't have any First Amendment issue in this

case, do we?
A

21

22

The guide, or

Ho, sir, there is no First Amendment,

At least,

if there is one, 1 think my client would be the parson who would
be in a position to raise it, and we are not raising it, Mr.
Justice»
The Secretary would have complete control over all

?

facilities,, over the employeesf over the qualifications, over

2

the train, over the time and method of operation»

3

fee of 3 per cent of the gross would be paid by the conces­

4

sionaire to the United States.

The franchise

At the time Universal entered into this concession

5

6

arrangement, they ware advised — actually, prior to it, they

7

were advised by the Secretary — that no other agency had

8

economic regulatory jurisdiction over this particular activity,

9

including, since we had asked the question, WMATC.

?

Q

10

Are you going to tell ns what use your client

n

would plan to make of the streets outside of the Park Service

12

area?
A

13

Actually, I wasn't aware of the fact that they

14

would make use of any streets outside of the park area, because

15

the streets, the Section 8144 of the District of Columbia

16

Code, provides that the streets between park areas are under

17

the regulation of the Secretary.

18

such as 14th Street, and so on.
Q

19

20

The trams would cross streets

So there would be no pickup point outside of

the park area that was so confined.
A

21

Is that right?

There would not be any pickup points outside the

22

park area.

they are doing this construction at 2nd Street, where the trams

24

might have had to go over one small area outside the jurisdiction

As a matter of fact, a

j

t

temporary service which is being operated now,, to which I will

z

address myself later, is not going that far, and is staying

3

wholly on park territory»

4

There is authority, if the service is to be extended,

5

say, for one block, or for a short turnaround area off of park

8

territory, for the Secretary to arrange to have this permitted,

by an exchange of letters with the D«C» Government»

A

It does, Your Honor, although one of our

the trams operated for some distance off the park property,

17

mean the service is still exempt from regulation by WMATC,

18

for reasons that have nothing to do with Section 8144 and 8108,

19

specifically»
Q

So it is your understanding that this court

21

should consider the case, as if these trams operated solely

22

on park service land?

theories, which I will discuss later, would, I think, even if

de minimis distance, and provided, of course, that the Secretary !

2

were able to arrange with the District Government for the

necessary exchange of regulatory authority, which isn't required*,

4

The D.C., WMATC initiated this action in the District

S

Court, when Petitioner, after being advised by the Secretary,

6

refused to apply for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity,;

7

The United States immediately intervened by filing a representa­

8

tion of interest, and has participated throughout these

9

proceedings as a party in effect either under the representation;
\
i

10

of interest or as an amicus, at all times supporting Petitioner.

1!

Pending the outcome of the loss of this action,

12

Petitioner has not operated the service.

13

September 1, the Secretary utilising Park Service personnel

14

and leasing equipment from Petitioner, has in fact been con­

15

ducting the service for, 1 guess it is, almost two months now.

Starting around

The WMATC complaint at page 5 of the Appendix, I

17

think, in a sense, really sums up, or at least gives a feeling

18

as to what WMATC is seeking.

19

20

Necessity, WMATC will b© deprived of the opportunity to

21

service to the Secretary and for the public.

They say that unless the

!

22
23

Mow, significantly, and underplaying throughout this

I
•j

24

proceeding, is the fact that the WMATC has not particularly

25

emphasised the fact that if the compact applies, not only would

3

1

the WMATC have the right to determine whether we are qualified,

2

but they would also have the right to determine by virtue of fchej

very same sentence that gives them the former power the right to:

determine if the service ‘is even needed»

of the Washington Metropolitan area compact, and to that

insurance to be maintained.

In other words, throughout the

entire contract, there is this complete scheme of regulation.

They would have the usual plenary

I

jurisdictional powers which they do over other regulated

agencies.

3

The petitioner has consistently throughout these

4

proceedings resisted this assertion of power by WMATC on a

5

number of grounds, which X would like to just summarize at this

6

point, and maybe we can explore the ones which are most

7

susceptible to oral argument at this time®

8

9

to
11
12

13
14
15
10

17

18
19

The first is that the proposed service is exempt from
regulation under the compact, by virtue of the exception con­
tained within the compact for transportation by the Federal
Governmento

That is, in a sense, an answer to Mr» Justice

Stewart’s question®

Namely, that even if the service were

off of the Kail for some distance, if this is fcransporafcion
"by the Federal Government", provided by a concessionaire, it
would be exempt from the compact coverage»
Secondly, Congress has committed the Mall itself to —
Q

You say it wouldn't be?

A

It would be.

Q

I thought that, and perhaps I incorrectly recall

this, but as 1 read the papers here, I thought that that
20
21

22
23
24
25

exemption applied only to transportation of the Federal Govern­
ment’s own personnel»
Am I wrong about that?
A

I

Mr» Justice Fortas, that is the issue»

Mr»

Cunningham, to my right, Mr» Russell Cunningham, on behalf of
12

\

2
■£
3
4

S

WMATC , has urged that, transportation by the Federal
Government is limited to —
Q

1 am talking about the express exemption.

How

does that read?
A

The express exemption is just '’transportation

8

by the Federal Government", and then it goes on, as on political;

7

subdivision of the signatories.

8
9
10
11

12

Q

X see, and does not expressly limit it to

employees, then?
A

Ho, not at all.

That is the very first issue

to which we will address ourselves.
The second, of course, is that the Mall itself, that

13

is, has a territorial exclusiveness of jurisdiction here,

14

which the Secretary possesses, and since this takes place

13

within that

area,

it is within his exclusive charge and control.

16

The third is that this kind of transportation does not

17

fall within the basic handle by which WMATC claims jurisdiction,

18

because it is not, quotes "transportation for hire."

19

a question, of course, of what is meant by the term "transpor­

20

tation for hire.”

21

22

Lastly, DC Transit has claimed that under its
»
franchise, which was granted in 1956, it has, quite apart from

23

the compact, an independent basis for claiming that before the

24

Petitioner can operate in its service, it must obtain a

25

Certificate of Convenience and necessity.
13

This is

[

I would like to focus on the point that Mr» Justice

t
2

Forfcas just mentioned, and that is, whether this is transporta­

3

tion by the Federal Government.
In our view, transportation by the Federal Government ;

4
5

is present in this case, because in the first place;, the Secre­

©

tary is discharging through this concessionaire a fundamental

7

function which he has traditionally and historically furnished, I

8

either directly or through concessionaires.
Secondly, the Federal Government, through the

9
10

Secretary, has control over every phase of this operation, to

11

the same extent, as it would if it were conducted by its own

12

employees.

13

things like Civil Service regulations, which would prevent

U

people from being discharged in that sense.

15

Perhaps even more, because you don't have certain

Thirdly, tha Petitioner's day-to-day activities will

16

be physically intertwined with those.

ft

trams will bear Park Service emblems, the personnel will wear

18

uniforms approved by the Park Service, the script, the narrative

19

script, the First Amendment problem, which is the very heart of

20

the service, will be subject to the Park Service's approval.

21

The schedule of service., the operation will be tailored to the

22

day-to-day changing needs on the Mall, so that if something

23

is taking place at the Smithsonian Institute, the service can

24

be rerouted either to take that into account, or move around it.

25

The Park Service of the

So whether viewed from the standpoint of the public,

14

1

who are the beneficiaries of this service, or from the stand*-

2

point of WMATC’s own regulatory jurisdiction,, if makes no

3

difference that the Secretary has decided to do this service

4

through a private concessionaire, as oppooed to simply using

5

his own vehicles and his own personnel.

6

the discharge of his responsibility elements, are all there.

The control elements,

Finally, quite apart from this, of course, is the

7
8

exclusive charge and control which the Secretary enjoys over

9

the Mall.

10

exclusive charge and control has been delegated now to the

II

Secretary of the Interior over these areas, and this was made

12

clear in 1909, when the Congress extended this charge and

3

control to the

14
5

Since 1898, in a statute new codified in Section 8108

roads between park areas, and to the sidewalks

adjacent to park areas.

The Public Utilities Commission, and the ICC, never .

were given any statutory authority to regulate activities within

because they certified.

that went to various points in the District of Columbia, and

Mall, over by the National Art Gallery.

to it.

The. point is that when there are not contributing regu­

7

latory schemes, and if the Secretary is willing to let the

8

activity continue, there is no reason for him to interfere.

9

However, here we have an activity on the part of the Secretary

10

himself, through a concessionaire, in which he does not want

n

interference, and that I think is the essential point of idif-

12

ference between the fact this PUG might have, in the course of

13

regulating carriers, whose activities could be and Were

18

The same thing, of course, would apply to taxicabs.
We have seen the maps in the back of the taxicabs, and there

19

is not a big block out there for the rates to be charged in

20

the Mall area, but what good would that have done? I am sure

21

the Secretary, if he is

sure he is not going to try and preventthem from a rate

?

D.C. Transit's point, that its franchise gives it the right to

z

insist on certification.

3

page 36A, et seq., of our brief, towards the rear, provides

first, a grant of authority to D.C. Transit to operate a mass

Now we interpret fcahfc to apply. No.1, only to the

regular route service of D.C. Transit.

effect, not monopoly, but this protection to be afforced to
",
WMATC was meant to protect the service which it was being

16

required to render, and that is, its regular route service, not

17

a permissive service of sightseeing.

Because this, in

The language "competitive street railway line which

18

runs over a given route on a fixed schedule", maybe

10

if they
■

20

didn't insert the word "competitive"1, you could argue it also

21

protected the sightseeing situation, and certainly as the

22

District Court found, -.this does not compete, at least in any

23

significant way, with the regular route service.

_,

I think it rather hard to envision a tram moving at

24
25

j

less

than ten miles an hour from various points around the Mall
17

1

as competing with the regular route service of D.C. Transit»

2

But even if Section 3 extends its protection to D.C. Transit"s

3

”sightseeing activities”, we still believe that it is not a

4

applicable; because it requires that the service,which is being

5

The question of the proper area for legislation

3

within the District of Columbia, under Article 1, Section 8,

4

of the Constitution, pertaining to municipal affairs on one

5

hand, and the broad, national legislation, particularly with

e

respect to Article 4, Section 3, on public lands, on the other,

7

and the compatibility of legislative actions between those

8

two areas in particular.
1 think the question here is the extent to which

12

should be deemed modified or qualified by the enactment of

18

We think there is no question but what Congress has

15
16

it is?

19

given exclusive charge and control to the Secretary over the

20

National Parks.
It has, as Petitioner has pointed out, placen a

22

responsibility upon the Secretary to promote the use of these

parks, for the purposes for which they were created, in

16 USC 1.

at least three persuasive, if not controlling, decisions of

10

The first. United States against Wittek, on the ques­

11

tion whether a national agency’s authority within the District

12

of Columbia is going to be impliedly negated or qualified bv

13

the enactment of general District of Columbia legislation.

14

The second question arises under Yearsley against

15

W. A. Ross Construction Company, as to the question whether

IS

a concessionaire, operating under the close supervision and

17

control of Federal officers in the performance of governmental

18

functions, is an agent of the United States and acts in place

19

of the United States and in context, would be subject to the

20

exclusion for transportation by the Federal Government set

21

forth in Article 12, Section 1-A of the Compact.

22

And third, by analogy, to Leslie Miller, Incorporated

23

against Arkansas, where this Court said the mere existence

24

of duplicate regulatory authority over a Federal activity

2.5

by the Federal Government, on the one hand, and by a local
23

1

government on the other, creates conflicts,, and is a frustra­

a

tion of the Federal purpose»

3

We Submit, contrary to the broad opinion of the Court \

4

of Appeals, that if this be so, it is inconceivable that

S

Congress would place administrative control over any part of

6

the National Park program in a fcri-State, local administrative

"'f

body *

3
3

We submit that as in Wittek, so here, confusion has
arisen between the operation and effect of congressional

10

action in the national sector and the operation and effect

n

of congressional action on the local sector»

12

The problem in Wittek was this:

Did the Emergency

13

Rent Control Act of the District of Columbia, of 1940, apply

14

to Federal low rent housing and defense housing within the

15

District of Columbia, which was then under the control of the

m

National Housing Administrator, and operated by the National

17

Capital Housing Authority?

18

In. that respect, this Court said, on page 351;

19

"It is practically inconceivable that Congress

20

would have subjected the Government-owned low-rent housing

21

program in the District of Columbia to the additional control

22

prescribed by the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act»"

23

And on 355, the issue is ifhethar the United States,
,

24
25

through whatever agency it operates, is to be controlled in its
rental policies by the District Administrator of Rent Control.

j

•>

<3

Here we were not concerned with an interstate or a

l

State agency, but a very creature of Congress, in the District

3

of Columbia, by legislation, that was denied that authority.
But even more in point, on 358, I think the Court

4

S

uses language that could almost be paraphrased and applied

6

to the problem before this Court.

It said;

"The Act" — referring to the District of Columbia

7

8

Emergency Rent Act — "contains no express reference to the

9

United States as a landlord or to the application of the Act

10

to Government-owned housing of any kind.

11

circumstances and legislative history of the District Act

12

neither express nor imply a change in the authority already

13

vested in permanent Federal agencies in their

14

of the Government-owned housing in the District."

United States against Wittek, Opinion by Justice

Burton, in 1949.
Now, our fact siguation here is very similar.

20

Transit franchise that purports to extend jurisdiction into

21

the National Park enclave.

22
23
24
25

Congress has operated the National Parks throughout
the country under Article 4 of Section 3, and the District
of Columbia under Article 1, Section 8, clause 17, and in the
past has been meticulous to try to separate the areas of
25

conflict within the District of Columbia.

Q

A

I want to spend just a moment on the other very

3

significant aspect of the case, which is the exclusion under

4

Article 1, or Article 12, Section 1-A, applicable to transpor­

5

tation by the Federal Government„

6

In Yearsley against W. A. Ross Construction Company,
a contractor was performing services for the Corps of

8

Engineers in straightening the channel of the Missouri River,

9

and was under the supervision and. control of the Corps.
On the question of whether he was subject to

10
11

.independent liability to third persons, it was determined that

12

he was acting as the agent of the Government.
All the more so, we submit, in this peculiar National

13
14

Park concession situation, where the very services which the

15

Secretary of the Interior is directed to perform under 16 USC,

16

Section 1, are by a policy of Congress to be performed by

17

concessionaires.
The concessionaires are acting under the supervision

18
19

of the Director.

The concessionaire is performing a service

20

that the Government is obligated to perform.
It is the act of the United States, in the transpor-

!i

22

tation of the United States, for which the exclusion was

23

intended.

24

25

It would elevate form over substance to say that the
interest of transportation in the District of Columbia is
28

1

affected differently by the operation of these trams wholly

2

within the National Park enclave, by the Secretary of the

3

Interior —

4

Q

Mr. Martz, suppose the Secretary were to decide
I

S

that it would be a good idea to have this sort of interpretive

6

tram service serving all of the capital park areas, all of

1

the park areas under his jurisdiction in the District of

8

Columbia.
Would the principle there be any different with

9
10

respect to the problem that we have before us?
A

11
12

Not with respect to the construction of the

Compact.
There would be a threshold question as to the author--

13

14

ity of the Secretary to conduct the service outside the park

35

areas.

Q

He would then have to use the streets in the

that under the 1-A exclusion, the services that were being

21

performed for and on his behalf would foe services of the United

22

States,

23

.

Q

He would have the authority there, as much as

he has it in the present case, wouldn't he?

Particularly

when you assume that in the present case these trams would
29

1

have to use some cifcy streets?

2
3

A

16 USC, Section 1, authorizes him to act only

in National Parks.

to do certain things outside of the parks, in emergency situa­

A

That is correct, Your Honor»

Q

So that in your submission, the Secretary of

the Interior could now set up an interpretive tram service
to all of the parks in the District of Columbia under his
30

1

jurisdiction, even though that would require a very substantial

.2

use of the city streets, and to do that, he 'would not have

3

to obtain the authority of or clear with the Washington

That is correct, Your Honor, as long as it is

contained within the exception.

at all, if the so-called city streets are used at all by this

16

statutory exception.

17
18
10

Q

We feel it is exempted under that

So that actually maybe this case can be disposed

of on that one question.
If we should believe, for example, that the correct

20

construction of the Compact is that whatever the Federal Govern­

21

ment may do correctly is exempt, therefore, whatever the FederaL

22

Government may do through a concessionaire is also exempt.

23

That would dispose of the case.

24

A

25

Yes, sir? and I submit to you^ Mr. Justice

Fortas, that you would effectively dispose of any type of
37

1

regulation of transportation in the metropolitan area, for you

2

would thereby completely emasculate the jurisdiction of the

3

Commission to control regulation in this area»

4

Every city, every town» every county» even the State

5

jurisdictions themselves» would be freed on the stroke of a

6

pen by entering into a contract with a private carrier to

7

set up and operate their own mass transit system.

8
9

Q

We didn’t write the Compact.

We have to

A

Right, sir, and that is why the Commission

read it.

10
11

advocates that the construction given to that clause should

12

be strictly construed» as I understand this Court has ruled

13

previously, all, any exemption to a broad remedial statute

14

like a compact, the exemptions are strictly construed, and

IS

that is the position we advocate to this Court, that that

16

proviso should be strictly construed, not only for the

17

mischief that it would do in the future, and do today, but

18

because it itfould destroy the whole historical scheme of

19

regulation.

20

Q

Suppose this kind of service was rendered in

21

Yellowstone National Park, or Yosemite, or Glacier National

22

Park.

23

couldn’t do it without going to the Interstate Commerce

24

Commission?

23

A

Would there be any reason to say that the Government

No, sir, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, there would
38

1

not, because the Congress has not imposed the scheme of regula­

2

tion, i,e,, it has not passed an Interstate Compact in Yellow- i

3

stone Park, as it has here in Washington„

4

I submit to you., sir, that the Congress, when it

5

looked at establishing the Compact here in this area, said

S

we are to look at the metropolitan Washington area as

7

a single unified city, and. this includes park areas.
It has to.

8
9

It is sitting right here in the very

heart, the very core of our city*
On the other hand, there is no such scheme existing

It is not part of a transit regulatory system.

It is not the

14

16

the Secretary in the National Parks, but that proviso was

not enacted, was not carried over and reenacted, sir, in the

18

Compact,
i

10

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

But I understood you to say that if the Govern­

ment itself performed this service in Washington that it would
be all right»
A

Assuming he has the statutory authority to do so

If that Government agency has the statutory authority to do
so, under the terms of the Compact it would be permissible,
Q

Why in that respect couldn't it do what it does

39

1

in Yoseraite, or Yellowstone Park, and delegate that to a

2

concessionaire? and have that the act of the Government?

3

4

A

Because I think in this case it was to discourage,

No. 1, to discourage active engagement by the Government in
'

5

this? by contract or otherwise, in engaging in transportation.

6

Q

It would do what?

7

A

It would discourage governmental units from

8
9
10
11

getting into the contract, into the transportation business.
First of all, if a Government unit decides,

,:We

want to get into a particular phase of transportation," if
it has to go to the legislature and get the statutory authority j

12

to do so, if it has to go in and have the appropriations

13

enacted for it, this is quite a different thing from saying,

14

"Well, let's just go get Joe Jones and sign a contract with

15

MrB Jones,and let him operate this service and pay us a profit."

16

There is much more involved in operating in con­

17

cession or a contractual service than there is — and more­

18

over, this is directly contrary to the whole concept of regula­

19

tion that has existed in this country since 1887✓ and that is,

20

that the Government itself is not subject to its own laws, and

21

if it wants to operate its own service, it may do so.

22
23

24
25

On the other hand, if it wishes to have a service
performed by a private carrier, a private person, that person
is subject to the regulatory scheme of that governmental
agency, whether it be the national Government, vis-a-vis the
40

i

2

Interstate Commerce Commission, or State government, or in

2

this case, the Interstate Compact.

Q

What power of regulation would your Commission

have over these people, if you win this case?
A

The same broad regulatory jurisdictions that we

have over all carriers.

Would he?

They change their routes,

they change their fares, they change all aspects.
Now, that is subject to the overall scheme of regula­

24

tion, but there is that freedom of movement, within the

25

regulatory aspect.

41

j

1

The Transit Commission is a regulatory agency, not

a manager.

is going on within the broad regulatory concept to provide a

4

good transit system throughout this whole metropolitan area.

Not a management agency.

And we try to fit what

S

Q

Would you determine the fares?

6

A

No, sir.

The fare, that would be determined

7

by the Secretary of Interior, and Universal, pursuant, to their

a

contract.

9

Universal, if they were the recipient of a Certificate

10

of Public Convenience and Necessity, would then file a tariff

11

with the Commission, stating that these are the fares to be

12

charged, and that would be subject to approval.

53

Q

Would you be obliged to file that?

14

A

Oh, yes, I would think, under the law, yes,

16

Q

You would have to?

17

A

Yes, sir.

15

13

19
20

sir.

And this is done today, within, for

example, the last three weeks, if I may.
Q

I will get this?

If a tariff is filed, is it

subject to the Commission's approval?

2!

A

It is subject to the Commission's approval.

22

Q

Well, then, perhaps I misunderstood your answer

23

to the Chief Justice.

24

25

It has to be approved.

It could be reviewed by the

Commission, could it not?
42
I

1

A

2

Q

And could be rejected?

3

A

Yes, sir*

4

Q

It could be reviewed, yes, sir.

Even though it had been pursuant to an arrange­

5

ment between the Secretary of the Interior and the private

6

concessionaire?
A

7

That is true, Mr* Justice Brennan, and I would

3

think the Commission would give the greatest weight —

2

I would think whenever a concessionaire of the Secretary of

lO-

the Interior came before the Commission stating that this is

ll

the type of service, or this is the type of fare that we pro­

12

pose to charge, that that would, be accorded almost an auto­

'13

matic presumption of being legitimate, because the Commission

14

would recognise the special interest that is involved in this

IS

area,

18

involving only a very limited

and the Secretary of the Interior says, "Because of my

say,

3This is the Thomas Jefferson Memorial.8"
First, does your Commission have any control over

the script that is used by the tour guides?

6

A

7

with me, Mr. Justice.

8

because of the bus robberies here in town.

9

The scrip" is a bad word to use, recently,
We have been on this scrip system

Yes, sir, I would assume all aspects of subject —

10

Q

I wasnE't talking about a substitute for money.

11

A

I assume this is what they were talking about.

12

Q

Suppose that the Secretary of the Interior —

13

You would agree that the Secretary of the Interior

14

has a legitimate interest, I suppose, in having the Thomas

15

Jefferson Memorial pointed out fco tourists.

16

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

But he would have no way of seeing that that

la
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

was done, unless the tourist, service were under his juris­
diction, would he?
A

I am sorry, Mr. Justice Fortas.

I thought you

said "scrip," s-c-r-i-p, and you are talking about the script.
No, sir, the Commission would have very little
interest in that, although probably -Q

Do they have jurisdiction?

I am talking to jurisdiction.
44

!

A

1
2

1 can.81 conceive of the Commission having any

jurisdiction over the script itself, no»

3

Q

But the Secretary of the Interior might have?

4

A

Oh, yes, sir, I think a very legitimate interest,

5

just as the carriers today

who perforin these lectured

6

sightseeing tours have scripts for their

drivers to follow»

Sow, we have no concern with that, unless there

7
3

would be some vulgarity or something of this nature involved,

9

but I am sure there would be many instances where

10

we would have no idea what, the script itself even purports

31

to be»

12
13

Some of them are even on tapes, in some of the
carriers, multi-lingual languages»

14

Q

15

here is not exclusive

16

Now, what the Secretary proposes to provide
of other services of this sort, is it?

Suppose the Universal Service here were performing

37

under this contract, then D,C. Transit

or sightseeing services

18

of one sort or another could continue to operate on the Mall

10

area, could they not?

20

A

According to the District Court decision, that

21

is not up to either the Transit Commission or the carriers,

22

but any such service would be at the sufferance of the Secretary

23
24
23

of the Interior, and presumably he could draw his curtain around
the Mall and say, "Nobody is coming in here."
Q

Has he ever done that?
45

Has he done that?

1

2
3

A

No, sir»

As a matter of fact, the Secretary

has never been known as a regulator of transportation»
Q

Is there any provision in the Secretary6s con­

4

tract with Universal by which that is an exclusive service,

5

that they have exclusive rights to run the tours on the Mall?

6

A

I don't recall, Mr» Justice Fortas, from my

7

reading of the contract, whether there is an exclusivity

8

connected with it»

9
10

Q

I presume that there is»

Don9t some other companies actually furnish

some transportation?

It

A

There is other service on the Mall now»

12

Q

So it isn’t exclusive service?

13

A

As of this moment, no, because Universal is not

14

running the service, but I would assume that once Universal

15

begins running, it would be in the Secretary’s interest to

16

discourage other service, because he is going to get a

17

fee for it»

18

Q

19

20
21

22

I know, but that’s not what 1 am. asking»

asking whether the contract so provides»
I have forgotten»

I will have to check the contract,

if you don't know the answer»
Q

Well, would your interpretation of the Com­

23

mission’s authority mean that you could provide for this

24

service, and the Secretary could not keep it out?

25

I am

Let’s assume that Universal applied to you, and you
46

1

granted the permit.

2

or anything else?

3

A

4

Q

You wouldn't have to ask the Secretary

Wellf I would assume that Universal
If you wanted to authorise service on the Mall,

5

you could just authorise service on the Mall, and as far as

6

the transportation part of it was concerned, the Secretary

7

would have nothing to say about it.

8

That's your position?

9

A

No, sir.

Our'position is that there exists

10

dual jurisdiction in parklands, and that anyone wishing to

11

offer any transportation service there must have authorisation

12

from the Secretary of Interior to operate his vehicles on the

13

park property, and he must also have a Certificate of Public

14

Convenience and Necessity from the Commission.

15

Q

So even if there was no exemption, I mean,

16

whether there is an exemption or not, the authority of the

17

Commission is subject to the authority of the Secretary.

18
'19

If he wanted to keep your permittee off the parklands,
he could do that?

20

A

1 would think so, yes, sir.

2!

Q

Would it work the other way, too?

22

A

Or the other way around, yes, sir.

23

This is specifically a situation where there has to

24
25

be a great deal of comity between the two bodies.
Q

Suppose the Secretary of the Interior, in order

47

j

1

to take care of children who visit Washington, Said, "We want

2

a f ive~cent fare./' and the Commissioners said, "No, we don’t

3

dthink that that is equitable»

4

and there was a clash there between the Commission and the

5

Secretary of Interior»

6

A

The Commission.

7

Q

The Commission?

8

A

We want a ten-cent fare,"

Who would prevail?

Solely because we feel that under this scheme

9

of regulation for this metropolitan area, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

the Commission has to fit every form of transportation into

11

the overall program.
Now, I say this not lightly, because right now I am

12

13

sure most of Your Honors are aware of the fact that we have

14

literally hundreds of buses in the rush hour on Constitution

15

Avenue, hundreds of them, and as a matter of fact, I wish
..

10

some of those buses could make 10 miles an hour in the rush

17

hour.
But to set another large mass transit system — and

18
19

this is what we are talking about,* we are not talking about

20

running one or two or three articulated vehicles,* we are talk­

2

ing about the movement of thousands of people a day on, these

22

vehicles,

.

!

23

Now, suppose that the traffic conditions are such

24

that we can’t, that there has to be some inter-scheduling of

25

this service, that there has to be some accommodation made.

48

1

Now, if the Commission does not have jurisdiction

z

overall, the Secretary says he is going to run this service,

o

and the bus carriers say, "We are going to, run this service,"

4

and we are in an irreconcilable position, who is going to make

s

the distinction?

6
7

Q

Does the Secretary of the Interior propose to

have this service run on the highways of the city?
A

8

Sir, they can't run anywhere else»

Every single

S

street that they have talked about in this initial service —

10

and I remind you, sir, that it is initial service -■= operates

11

over a public street in the District of Columbia»
I don't care who owns it, whether it is owned by

12

13

the Park Sv^rvice, and maintained at least by the Park Service,

14

;
or whether it is owned, maintained, and policed by the District

IS

of Columbia, it is a public street, and everybody is out using

16

it.

17

Q

You mean whether it is in or out of the park?

10

A

Yes, sir.

19

22

23
24
25

j

And the service that is operated

today, down on the Mall today, is on a public road.

20
21

1

Q

He isn't about to run these buses on Constitution

A

My understanding is that it is running on

Avenue?

Constitution Avenue, and will run.
How else can it run?

It has to turn around down

at the Capitol, and run back up, Mr. Justice White, and they

49

i'

3

are also talking about running —

2

Q

■

You think the issue that Mr» Fortas raised

3

with counsel a while ago is really here,, whether or not the

4

Secretary has the authority without consulting the Commission

5

to operate this service over District of Columbia streets?

6

A

Yes, sir, very much so.

7

Q

I didn't know that.

8

A

The service that is being operated today,

9

1 think without question, is in the Secretary's mind, the very

10

minimum of service that would foe provided.

11

he will want to extend the service to the Union Station

12

Visitors' Center.
Unquestionably, he will want to run the service up

13
14

around the Capitol.
Unquestionably, he will want to run it up around the

15

16

Unquestionably,

White House.

17

Q

What is the issue that is here?

A

Because any decision you make here, Mr. Justice

*

;

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

White, is going to be just as applicable tomorrow, when the
service is extended another block, or another two blocks, or
across the river to Arlington Cemetery, or down to Mount
Vernon.
Q

That may be true insofar as the construction

of the exemption is concerned.
A

Yes, sir, as that's the one the Commission is
50

|

»

most worried about»

2
3

Q

Yes, l know, but it wouldn’t be true insofar

as his base of authority was concerned,

4

A

Well, Mr, Justice White, if you decide this

5

question on the basis that the Secretary's legislative enact­

8

ment says that he has exclusive jurisdiction, and we will not

7

consider any other legislative enactment, then, if you stop

8

there, that would be one thing, but I think you have got to

9

take this one step further and say, "Is this service to be

10

provided transportation?"
Now, I don't think there is any other conclusion that:

11

I?.

you can come to, other than that it is transportation.
This is what is going on, going to be going on,

13
14

throughout the Mall area, is transporting people.
Q

15

Well, 1 understood counsel on the other side

16

to say that the only place that they went on the public high­

17

ways was to go across 3rd and 5th and 7th, 9th, and 14th,

18

something like that, across those streets.
They did not run along those, they crossed those

19

20

streets, and that those streets were only public streets,

21

subject to the regulation of the Department of the Interior.

22

Now, I wonder if J. am wrong about that.

23

A

That is what the United States stated to you,

Q

All right.

24
25

sir.
Now, is that true, or untrue?
51

'I

A

2

That Act states as follows;

3

"The applicability of the rules and regulations

I don't believe it is true.

4

prescribed and applicable to the Secretary is hereby extended

5

to cover the sidewalks, the sidewalks around the public

S

grounds, and the carriageways of such streets as lie between

7

and separate said public grounds.

>

•i

r

8

Q

What?

9

A

It is hereby stated and covered "... the side-

10

walks around the public grounds, and the carriageways.of such

11

streets as lie between and separate the said public grounds."
!

12

Q

Now, isn't that 3rd, 56h, 7th, 9th, and 14th,

13

or whatever those cross streets are across the Mall?

14

it include those?

15

A

Doesn't

That would include it to the extent, now, for

16

example, that the streets are involved now, perhaps 2nd Street,

17

3rd Street, and 9th Street.

18

\

Now, the thing the Commission is worried about, Mr.

19

Chief Justice, is that the rule you lay down here will also

20

have to embrace transportation to Ford's Theater, to the
//•

21

White House, to the Visitors' Center.

'

V

22

Q

23

A

Not necessarily.
\

Now, if you start talking about connecting

24

streets between the Mall and the Visitors' Center, we have got

25

a space of four blocks, five blocks, of all District streets.
52

;

3

Q

But these streets, as I understand, bisect

2

the Mall, that some years ago did not bisect it, and the

3

Congress, in order to take care of that situation, said that

4

the Mall might be bisected, provided the Secretary of the

S

Interior had control and jurisdiction over those streets»

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

But now it. hasn't done that to the streets

0

between the Mall and Ford's Theater, or between the Mall and

9

the old Union Station, or any of those places, and if they

to

went that, I suppose they would have to go and get statutory

11

permission to do it, wouldn’t they?

12

A

I really don't know, Mr» Chief Justice, because

13

they talk about such streets as lie between and separate public

14

grounds.

15

Now, they are not referring to the Mall, here»

16

Q

Well, doesn't a stred: across the Mall separate

18

A

Yes, sir.

19

Q

Well, then, it would be included, then»

20

A

17

21

22
23
24
25

the Mall?

And there are perhaps seven or eight streets

which separate the Mall from the Visitors3 Center»
Q

Well, they are not separating the Mall, when

you have a street between it and the Visitors' Center»
A

Yes, sir, but some of this operation is out on

the D.C. streets, and not just going across.
53
;

!

I didn't get that last statement,,

I didn't

understand that last statement that you just made»
A

If you will defer just a moment, sir, I wanted

4

to get to my map 1 have here»

Yes.

You will note that the lines run, the arrows, down

The service contemplated will run down Constitution

15

A

Yes, sir.

that lies

Constitution Avenue,you say?

It does separate the Government grounds, though,I

A

I really don't know what it is going to do to

7

us, unless this transportation is subject to our jurisdiction,

8

because one of the problems we have, and it is a great one

9

today, is accommodation of vehicles on these streets.
Mr. Chief Justice, you will recall that in one of

IQ
1?

the statutory requirements placed upon this Commission, which,

12

has never been placed upon a transportation regulation agency

13

before, is the alleviation of traffic congestion on the streets

14

of the District, through the regulation of the mass transit

15

system.

1S

And it could cause us considerable problems, but the

17

biggest problem to come about is if this service is not melded

18

in in an orderly fashion with the other service.

19

Q

1 Is this route being used now by the National

20

Park Service?

Is this a correct representation of the route

21

new being used by the National Park Service?

22

A

23

I said no, sir.

24

25

No, sir.

The service now being —
You understand ray answer is limited,

my knowledge is limited.
To the best of my understanding, the service is not
55

1

operating up around the White House, around the Ellipse, today.

2

Q

Is it operating on Constitution Avenue?

3

A

Yes, sir, to the best of my knowledge.

4

Q

As shown on this map?

5

A

To the best of rny knowledge, it is.

0

Q

And is Constitution Avenue, where these buses

7

run, speaking now of the new proposed buses, is that street

e

under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior?

s

A

I believe it is classified as one of the streets

10

in which there is dual jurisdiction, that both the Park Service

11

and the District police .it and maintain it.

12

Q

Is that .the way it appears in the statute,

13

dual jurisdiction, or does the statute say that the Secretary

14

of the Interior shall have jurisdiction over it, and that

13

these other people who use it, use it in accordance with regu­

16

lations of the Secretary of the Interior?

17

A

Mr. Chief Justice, rny recollection of the record

18

is that this portion of Constitution Avenue that is shown on

19

Exhibit B is owned and maintained by the District of Columbia,

20

and not the Secretary of the Interior.

21

22

I could be wrong.

It could be another section, but

that was my understanding.

23

We feel that the language of Section 1, and that

24

this case really must turn on the language of Section 1*“A,

25

\

and that language clearly defines the scope of the Commission1s
56
i

'J

2

jurisdiction, and that is

that it is transportation, and

embraces the person who engages in that transportation.

3

Now, transportation is not defined in the Compact,

4

but it is slot given a restricted meaning, other than the genera;,

5

term.
I believe that the service that would be engaged

6

7

in by Universal will be, or any concessionaire of the

0

Secretaryss, will be transportation.
As I said before, this legislation stated that

3

10

Title II provides a regulatory lav? which is to be administered.
Section 1 defines the scope of the Compact, and the

11
12

scope of the transportation coverage.

14

kind of specialised service, but used the term "transportation,

10

which we feel embraces all types of transportation, services.
That language is clear and unambiguous.

16

Neverthe­

57

less, it is urged and decided below in the District Court that

IS

the term "transportation" does not really mean transportation,

13

it means mass transit.

21

that decision, and felt that transportation must be construed

22

to mean simply all forms of movement by motor vehicle of

23

people.

25

•!

1

Nov;, the Court of Appeals quite obviously reversed

20

24

I

Section 1 does not say mass transit, or any other

13

s{
.

:

To reach the determination that it is mass transit
rather than transportation per se, one must ignore, No» 1, the

57

|

J

1

plain language of the law; must ignore the legislative history;

2

must ignore the historical concept of regultfcion; and you must

3

ignore previous decisions of the

4

Appeals for the District of Columbia.,

5

United States Court of

In each case, that Court said that this Commission’s

0

jurisdiction should be given the broadest construction

7

possible, to embrace all forms of transportation»
It also conforms to the major principles of law

8
9
10

that remedial statutes of the Compact shall be broadly construed
and all exemptions narrowly construed»
The Commission feels it can't be argued or denied

11
12

that the function under Universal's contract is Universal

13

has performed a movement of people in motor vehicles»
This service is going to be operated on streets»

14
15

It is going to be operated on public streets, regardless of

16

who is the owner and maintainer of that street»
It will be in a vehicle that will be owned by a

17

18

private carrier, it itfill be driven by employees of that

19

private carrier, and as the contract itself specifies, those

20

employees shall be dressed so as to be distinctly known, as

21

22
23

j

i
;
Universal employees! not Park Service employees, but Universal !
employees.
Now, what happens when a man gets on at the end of

24

the Mall to take a tour?

He is not only getting in Univer­

25

sal’s vehicle, driven by Universal's driver, he pays Universal

58

f

t
|

1

a fee,, and that money then becomes Universal's,

2

Clearly the act of any carrier, any common carrier

3

in this country — this is the role that it performs, and that

4

is the role that a utility carrier provides, whether that

S

act is done for the general public, which is this case, here

G

this is not a service for the United States; it is a service
■

7

for the public.,
Wow, contrast that, if you will, with the USAC

8
9
10

Transport case,, in which the transportation being provided
there was to the Federal Government itself»
Here the service is not being provided to the Govern-

11
12

rr.enfc.

13

come down on to the Mall«

14

It is being provided to the millions of people who will

The Federal Government is giving up, or allowing a

15

carrier to come on its property and operate to perform certain

16

services that it requests, and would like to see performed

17
18
10
20
21

22
23
24
25

for the public, and in turn, receives a percentage fee of the
fares collected through the fare box of that contract carrier»
Nov;, today ive have numerous carriers operating under

I

contract with various governmental agencies, Department of
State, Department of Defense, the Army, the Navy.

In each

case, those carriers have authorization from the Commission.
Now, that service is regulated insofar as the stan-

|

dard of service is concerned and insofar as fares are concerned,
We have not had one single conflict with those
59

s

governmental agencies insofar as what service they want, and

2

what service is directed and authorised by the Commission.

3

Not one single bit of difference.

4
S

5

And we submit, Your Honors, that this would be the
case under this situation.

6

Thank you very much.
