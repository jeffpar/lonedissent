MR, CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD M, FEUERSTEIN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FEUERSTEIN:

8
9
10

Counsel are present,
Mr, Feuersfcein,

Mr, Chief Justice, and may if please

the Court,
I am Howard M„ Feuerstein of Portland, Oregon, repre­

11

senting the Petitioner, Martin Rene Frazier, who is a prisoner

12

in the Oregon State Penitentiary, serving a 25 year sentence

13

for second degree murder.

14
15
16

This case involves Frazier's petition for writ of
habeas corpus and involves three distinct issues.
The first issue is whether Frazier was denied right

17

of confrontation when the prosecution placed before the jury

18

in its opening statement the confession of a co-indictee, who

19

later invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify,

20

The second issue is the admissability of Frazier's

21

written statement and whether the obtaining of that statement

22

violated Escobedo versus Illinois, or in the alternative that

23

statement was involuntarily given.

24
25

And finally, the case involves an issue of validity
of a search and seizure of certain clothing of Frazier.
2

1

The District Court granted the writ of habeas corpus

2

on the right of confrontation and on the confession issue and

3

did not rule on the search and seizure .issue»

4

The warden appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed

5

the District Court finding against Frasier on all three issues»

6

This Court granted certiorari*,
If it please the Courts, 1 will discuss the facts as

7
8

they pertain to each issue separately.
Frazier and his cousin Rawls were jointly indicted

9
10

for first degree murder in the strangulation slaying, one

11

Russell Marleau.
Frazier entered a plea of not guilty and at the time

12
13

of Frazier’s trial Rawls had entered the plea of guilty to a

14

reduced charge of second degree murder and was in jail awaiting

15

sentence on that charge.
At Frazier’s trial, Frazier's defense attorneys

16
17

admitted that Rawls, Frazier and Marleau were together at the

18

time of Marleau's death and that an altercation occurred.

19

defense, however, asserted that it was Rawls that strangled

20

Marleau and that. Frazier had no part in the strangulation.
The prosecution, of course, denied this.

21

22
23
24
25

The

They had

ample evidence placing the three at the secluded scene of the
crime.

They, of course, had no direct evidence as to who did

the strangling because there are no other eye witnesses.
Q

He was also hit on the head?
3

1

A

2

That is correct»

However, that was not. the

cause of death*

3

The prosecution primarily tried to impeach Frasier's

4

version of what had transpired»

5

trial was to start, prior to impaneling a jury, the attorneys

6

met with the judge in chambers.

The day in which Frasier's

7

At that time Frasier's attorney informed the District

8

Attorney that he had heard that Rawls had been subpoenaed, that

9

he had just talked to Rawls' attorney and been informed that

10

Rawls would not testify if called to the stand»
We know that prior to this time the District Attorney

11
12

was in possession of conflicting evidence on whether or not

13

Rawls would testify.
A jury was impaneled and the next day the District

14
15

Attorney made his opening statement.

In the course of the

16

opening statement he said that the officers had talked to

17

Rawls during their investigation and that the District Attorney

!8

was going to call Rawls as a witness.
At this point, holding Rawls confession in his hand

19

20

the District Attorney proceeded to paraphrase that confession.

21

The defense moved for a mistrial after the opening statement

22

which was denied.

23

to the stand and Rawls appeared with his attorney and refused

24

to testify.

Later the District Attorney called Rawls

Defense renewed his motion for mistrial and a hearing

25

4
li

I

was held before the judge.

z

Q

The motion was denied.

Is there any rule in your State that if you are

3

going to introduce evidence along a certain line you have to

4

mention it in the opening statement?

5

A

Well there is no requirement that you —

6

Q

There is none?

7

A

—— have to mention it in the opening statement„

8

Q

There is none?

9

A

No, your Honor.

10

Q

Was the paper that the District Attorney was

11

holding on his opening statement referred to in his opening

12

statement?

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

As a confession?

A

It was not referred to as confession.

15

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

If you

read the opening statement which is in the appendix on pages 41
to 43, the relevant part, you will find that, for instance,
that near the very first the prosecutor said that it is Rawls8
version that such and such occurred.
He stopped and he said, "Maybe I am wrong.
look here as to whether Rawls said he hit him first.”

/
I will
And there

are other times we have phrases like "Rawls said" or "Rawls”
version" so that there was a clear inference that the officers
had talked to Rawls, two, that Rawls had given his version to
the officers, and three, the inference is inescapable that what
5

1

the District Attorney was doing was setting out before the jury

2

what Rawls’ version was and what Rawls had told the police*

3

Q

4

introduced?

5

A

The written confession itself we have never was

That is right»

In fact the defense never saw

6

the written confession and so Rawls later changed his plea to

7

not guilty and was introduced in

Rawls’ trial»

No specific instructions x^ere requested of the judge

8

and the judge did not give one to disregard these particular

9

ccmments in the opening statement.

10

The judge did, however, in his general charge to the

11

jury indicate that statements of counsel were not evidence.

12
13
14

15

Q

How long was this trial?

A

Pardon, your Honor.

Q

How long was this trial?

A

16

I think the ferial lasted approximately a week.

The District Court based its decision on this Court’s

17

opinion in Douglas versus Alabama.

18

The Court made a recall in

that case, the prosecutor by means of leading questions placed

19

the accomplice’s confession before the jury while the accomplice

20

/

was on the stand asserting the Fifth Amendment.

21

The Ninth Circuit and the warden wished to distinguish

22

Douglas versus Alabama in a later case of Bruton versus United

23

States, on the ground that here the prosecutor acted in good

24

faith, and that the statement was not unfair or prejudicial to
25

6
i
.

1

the defendant»
We submit, however, that the rule under Douglas and

2
3

Bruton is that where the prosecution places the substance of an

4

accomplice's confession before the jury and the defendant is

5

denied the right of confrontation if that is not subject to

6

cross-examination.
We submit that the defendant is just as surely denied

7

8

his right to confront and cross-examine Rawls whether or not

9

the prosecution acted in good faith or in bad faith or was

10

merely negligent in placing this before the jury»
Perhaps the Ninth Circuit and the warden had confused

11
12

the right of confrontation which is a fundamental right with

13

the more general due process right against prosecutorial mis­

14

conduct .

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Under Oregon law is the State limited to intro­

ducing its case in chief, evidence on, said in the opening
will be produced?
A

No, your Honor.

Not that I know of.

As far as

I know that
Q

In other words, if the prosecution made no

opening statement it could still introduce?
A

As far as I know, yes.

The warden also attempted to distinguish the Douglas
case from the present case by saying that here the statement was
made in the opening statement and was in the form of expected

7

S
i

i

testimony.

2

district attorney, clearly implied that Rawls had made a

3

statement, that Rawls had said these things, so that he clearly

4

raised the inference of past statements, rather than future

5

statements„

6

As I have already indicated the prosecutor, a

Certainly one cannot constitutionally distinguish

7

remarks that counsel made examining witnesses from remarks of

&

counsel made in opening statements.

9

is not suspended during opening statements»

10

The right of confrontation

The warden has hinted that the statement was not

11

prejudicial.

12

other eye witness to the crime and there was no other evidence

13

in the case t© the effect that Frasier strangled Marleau and

14

this was the key issue in the case.

IS

But we would point out that Rawls was the only

Hor, particularly under Chapman versus California,

16

can one assume that the jury forgot or ignored what the prose-

17

cutor said in his opening statement.

18

Surely when Rawls took the stand and refused to

19

testify and then the motion for mistrial was made, the jury

20

must have speculated on what Rawls would have testified and on

21

what was said in the opening statement.

22
23

Q

What was the elapse of time between the opening

statement and the appearance of Rawls?

24

A

I would say there was several days.

25

The prosecution contends that holding the prosecution
8

i

1

accountable for what if says in its opening statement had an

2

adverse effect on future cases.
We submit that this is not true»

3

If I were a prose-

4

cutor and I had a case in which I wanted to use a witness who

3

may or may not assert his right to testify, I have a choice..

6

cem say nothing in the opening statement about this witness'

7

testimony and if he does not testify then no harm has been made»
On the other hand, if he does testify, then in my

8
&

to
11
12

13

n
15
16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23

closing argument I can make all the mileage out of it that I
want.

There may be cases where the testimony of this witness

is so critical to the prosecutionBs case and the prosecution
may ba so sure that this witness will testify that the prose­
cution will take a calculated risk by bringing it out in the
opening statement, knowing full well that there may be a mis­
trial if the witness does .not testify.
Q

Supposing the prosecutor in this case, the

morning before he called Rawls, he. had gone down to see him
and said, “Are you going to claim your privilege or not?”
And Rawls says, "Mo, I am not going to claim my
privilege."
And then he puts him on the stand and Rawls has a
change of heart.
What would you say then?
A

I would say that the effect on the defendant is

24
just the same even though the prosecutor has the best faith in
25
9

I

1

the world, the best reason in the world that this man would
testify because the fact is- that the right of confrontation

3
4

is basic to our adversary system»
You put in effect a deposition or a written statement

5

of a witness which is subject to cross-examination and if it

6

goes before the jury, no amount of good faith will cure that.

7

Q

So you are arguing in this case excepting the

8

findings of the court below that there was no prosecutorial

9

misconduct?

10

A

Your Honor, more accurately I think I would say

11

that rather than excepting,-X would say that it does not matter»

12

I would point out, however, if the Court should find that good

13

faith is critical, then X would say that good faith and bad

14

faith are defined variously for different purposes in the lav.

15

And X would say surely when the prosecutor goes forth

16

blindly with conflicting information and does not conform or

17

deny that information that that is probably bad faith.

18
19

Turning to the admissibility of Frasier3s confession,
at the time Frasier was taken into custody -*

20

Q

Let me ask you one question»

21

A

Yes, sir, your Honor.

22

Q

I have some recollection from the briefs that

23

are intermediate to the first conference before the trial, where

24

counsel for the defendant said that Rawls was going to claim

25

his privilege, that there tras some other information that the
10

1

prosecutor had before Rawls took the stand that he was not

2

going to claim his privilege»
A

3
4

Mi I wrong about that?

What occurred was after Rawls refused., to testify

hearing was held and the prosecutor then told the judge under

S

oath what this information was and as 1 read that testimony,

8

and as I understand it, prior to the trial the prosecutor had

7

talked with Ravils' attorney or at least the prosecutor's deputy,

8
9

Rawls8 attorney told the deputy they had talked t© Rawls, that
Rawls would not testify»
However, some time prior to the trial, I think a

10
11
12
13

probation officer or perhaps a relative of Rawls and maybe some j
other people, they said that they thought that Rawls would
testify anyway.
So, in effect, if the prosecutor had conflicting

14
15
16
17

information, when it came time for the trial, as far as I can
tell 1 do not believe the prosecutor indicated that he re­
checked on this information after that beginning conference.
On the confession issue, it is clear that the investi-

18
19

20
21

22

gation had focused on Frazier and Rawls at the time Frazier
was taken into custody.

In this case we have a tape recording

of the entire interrogation.

Briefly it indicates that there

was preliminary question prior to any warnings being given
at which time Frasier denied having been with Marleau that

23

night.
24

Frazier was then told that he had a right to attorney
25

11

1

and whatever he said could be used against him.

2

questioning became more accusatory» but Frasier still denied

3

being with Marlean„

Then the

4

At that point the interrogator falsely told Frazier

5

that Rawls was in custody and that Rawls had told everything.

6

In fact Rawls was still free and the police had not yet talked

7

to him.
The interrogator used various standard emotional

&
9

fields» such

that Frazier should not shoulder the entire blame

10

himself» reference to Frazier's dead mother — he was on

11

emergency leave for a funeral leave at the time

12
13

and after

that Frazier admitted having been with Marleau the night of the
crime.
And he told the officers what happened up until the

14
15

time the threesome arrived at the scene of the crime.

16

Frazier stopped.

17

before I talk any more.

18

than I am in now."

Then

He said» "I think I had better get a lawyer
I am going to get into more trouble

The officer replied» “You can’t be in any more

19
20

trouble than you are in.”

21

rogation c

And then proceeded with the inter­

22

Frazier then gave his entire version of what trans­

23

pired although he still denied that he strangled -- pardon me

24

your Honor.

25

Q

That is right» this was before Miranda.
Before Miranda» yes.
12

1

A

That is correct, your Honor»

2

Frasier then made a complete oral statement of what

3

transpired although he still denied that he strangled Marleau.

4

The officer offered to type up the statement if Frazier would

5

sign it, pointing out that the officers would testify to his

6

7

8
3
10

11
12
13
14

IS
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

oral admission anyway, and that he would be entitled to an
attorney after arraignment, which would be made that night,
Frasier signed a written statement then which con­
tained the standard warnings and waivers, some of which were
mimeographed, others were typed on the statement,
Q

This was before Miranda and 1 didn9t know that

there were any standard warnings before Miranda»
A

You see, your Honor, this case is somewhat

peculiar in that at the time of this interrogation, the Oregon
Supreme Court had decided the Nealy Case in which interpreted
Escobedo in the broad sense»

It was liberal interpretations

of Escobedo»
Q

Perhaps in a way it rather anticipated the

Miranda Case?
A

That is correct, your HOnor»

So the officers, I think, only recently instituted
this procedure of the standard phrases»
Q

I see»

And he was given those warnings?
A

These were in the written statement.

25

13

Of course,

I

these warnings were not made* at least the warning of the right

£

to remain silent was not made prior to his oral admission*

3

Q

Yes*

4

A

We submit that the written statement was clearly

5

a fruit of the oral interrogation since the officers told him

6

that they would testify to the oral admissions if he didn8fc

7

sign the written statement so he might as well get it in

8

writing*

9

This case is also interesting in another facet in

10

that we not only have a tape recording of the entire interro­

n

gation, but we have a thorough psychiatric study of the accused.

12

Frazier had an insanity defense of psychiatrists, psychologists

13

and an oral surgeon that testified at the trial.

14

We know that Frazier had a passive personality.

15

One of the psychiatrists said he was like a leaf blowing in the

16

wind, that he is subject to discipline and direction, that his

17

interal punitive personality in which he tends to turn the

1©

blame within or to blame himself for whatever occurs, that he

19

was shy and immature and, of course, we know that Frasier had

20

no prior experience with interrogation.

21

On the Escobedo —

22

Q

Ha was home on leave from the Marine Corps?

23

A

Yes, your Honor.

24

Q

For his mother8s funeral?

25

A

That is correct, your Honor.
14

1
£
3

Q

His mother had been a widow.

The psychiatric

report showed that he had an over-possessive mother or what?
A

That is correct.
She had been pretty ill throughout his life and

4
5

had been on medication and had been abusive at times, yet he

6

was still very close to her.

7

Q

Yes.

8

A

He had no other family other than the Rawls.

9

Q

How old was he?

10

A

H® was 20 years old at the time.

n

With respect to Escobedo, the State contends that this;

12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20

21

22
23
24
25

was not an adequate request for counsel.

We submit that this

timid, plain request for counsel is all that is required.
Nothing in Escobedo or why an aggressive demand for counsel.
If Frasier had stopped and said, SSI won't say anything more to you until you give me an attorney,5* he doesn't
need an attorney because he won’t confess.
He asked for an attorney and his request was turned
aside and ignored.
Q

Didn't Johnson against New Jersey limit

Escobedo on facts?
A

That is true.

Then the question arises in the

context —
Q

What are the facts?

A

Yes, and what are the critical facts.
15

1

Q

Yes .

£

A

Of course, the fact that this man's

3

name is not

Danny Escobedo is not a critical fact of that case.

4

Q

But Escobedo did have a retained lawyer who

5

A

Yes, that is the other distinction which the

8

State has put forward that in Escobedo the accused already had

7

an attorney where here Frasier did not have an attorney at the

©

time he requested one.
We simply submit that the fact that Frasier did not

9
10

have the foresight or opportunity to hire a lawyer before he

11

was arrested is not a valid ground for distinction.
As to the voluntariness of the confession, of course,

12
13

this Court must review all the circumstances which it has now

14

has a great deal of information with which to do that, we

15

submit that under all the circumstances this was a confession,

16

a product of a will overborn.
That this"is a case where the will of a passive,

17
18

immature, interal punitive person, not previously interrogated,

19

was overborn by aggressive interrogation using falsehoods,

20

denial request for counsel, emotional apeals and lack of

21

warning.

22

There is one other question on the issue —

23

Q

Was the issue of coercion submitted to the

A

Yes, it was submitted to the jury.

24
25

hearing?

}
IS

That raises

!

somewhat of a problem* I believe* to the State's next con-

2

tention that Frasier waived his objection to the admission of

3

the confession because he took the stand and testified»

4

The fact is that the State agreed to placing the

5

voluntariness of the confession before the jury so the issue

6

was still in the case when Frasier testified.

7

In any case, the series of State cases are cited in

8

the Warden's brief* state that if the accused takes the stand

9

and repeats substantially the confession* the substance of the

10
11
12

13
14
15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

confession* that ha has waived the right to object to the
introduction of the confession under certain circumstances.
The first problem is that even under those cases the
State does not fit within the test because the test requires
that the defendant not deny* minimise or explain away the
statements in his confession.
But in at least two respects Frazier's testimony at
the trial differed from his confession and the prosecution on
cross-examination brought these out and attempted to impeach
Frazier’s credibility.

And his credibility was one of the key

issues in the case.
Moreover* as in the Ninth Circuit in Gladden versus
Unsworfch* and that is not cited in the briefs* it is 397 Fed.
2d 373* indicated the State cases relied upon by the Warden
do not set forth the Federal standard of i^aiver.
The Federal standard, of course* is an intelligent
17

1

relinquishment of a known right.

2

that Frasier when he agreed to take the stand,, being faced

3

with the reference to Rawls1 testimony in the opening statement

4

intended to waive his strong objection to the admission of the

S

written statement.

6

And we can find no indication

Certainly it cannot be said that there was no

7

prejudice in the admission of the written statements, assuming

8

prejudice is relevant at all under Chapman and other cases

9

dealing with forced confessions.

10

The fact that Frasier's written statement was used

11

have made up ©prima facie case without the written statement

On the search and seizure issue, the facts are rela­

5

Q

Is there any contention that that was without

Frazier’s consent?
A

There is no evidence in the case whether Frasier i

6

consented or not»

7

We do know that from Rawls expected testimony of the opening

8

statement that Rawls' version is that he had permission.

9
10

11

Q

There is no evidence one way or the other.

Well, would your argument change if it were

clearly shown that he did consent?
A

Well, no, because I am willing to assume for

12

purposes of argument that Frasier consented to the placing of

13

the clothes in the side compartment.

I have no objection.

14

Q

All right.

13

A

I have no objection to that assumption.

16

The problem is that when the police arrested Rawls

17

and asked him for the clothes that he wore the night of the

18

crime he said they could have them but they were in a blue

19

flight bag in his room.

20
21

22
23
24

25

The police went up, they took the bag, they took it
back to headquarters and searched it.
The State contends that because Rawls was a jointuser of the bag he had the power to consent to the search of
the bag and the police had the power to seise whatever they
found in the course of the search.
19

Thera is on© difficulty with that, your Honors.

That

is, that Rawls was a joint user of only the side pocket of the

bag.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD M. FEUERSTEXN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FEUERSTEIN:

8
9

10
11

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
On the search and seizure issue our contention is
quite simple and straightforward.
First, Rawls was a joint user of only the side pocket

13

of the bag and, therefore, only had the power to consent to a

14

search of the side pocket.

15

The mere apparent ownership of the bag as a whole

IS

would not be enough under Stoner versus California.

17

true that the police could seize anything that came into view

18

while searching that side pocket.

19

It is

But under Harris versus United States they could

20

seize only what came into view when they were in a place where

21

they had a right to be.

22

no consent to be in the center pocket they could not seize

clothing was found in the center compartment.

A

Yes, X do, your Honor,

Yes.

Q

And by reason of his consent?

A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

And that Frasier, although it was Frazier’s bag,

you feel that he had no right to object to the police being
in the side pocket?
22

That is right, because of the doctrine of a

joint user or joint use of a —

Right.

That is established.

But the police didn't know — what if the police

6

had gone in and started to search the bag had looked in the

7

center compartment first?
A

8
9

My positionwould be that they had no right to be

in the center compartment, your Honor.
Q

10

You mean until the search of the bag was com­

11

plete you couldn’t tell in which compartment the police were

12

entitled to be in?
A

18
14

Well, they didn't know.

Of course, they could

have always asked, but they did not, your Honor.

of knowing.

But you would say then they had to quit?

9

A

It is a question of power.

Well, I assume that they would not have any way

Once they leave the

10

domain of which they had the right to be and their only right

11

was because of consent ---

12

Q

My problem is that it would seem they had the

13

same right or power to be in any pocket of where Rawls9 clothes

14

might have been.

15

A

Well, an analogous situation might be suppose

16

that Frazier and Rawls jointly occupied a room and Rawls merely

17

said that, "My clothes ..are in this room, you can go get them.6’'

18

And that in that room was a dresser exclusively owned and used

19

by Frazier and that the police not knowing where Rawls9 clothes

20

were, went in a searched the dresser.

21

Q

Yes.

22

A

Not knowing, I would say that under those cir­

23

cumstances the police exceeded their authority and they were

24

in a place that they did not have the consent to be in which

25

Rawls did not have the power to give them consent to be.

of the search depended on what turned up?

clothing had in fact been in the middle compartment, you would

7

have said that that was a lawful search?

8

A

That is right.

9

Q

The only reason that you are arguing that it was

10

not is that instead of Rawls8 clothing in the middle pocket,

11

they came out with Frazier’s?
A

12
13

It was exclusively Fraziers,

That is correct.

It was exclusively used by Frazier,
Q

14

If Rawls had said, "My pants are hanging on a

15

hook in the room,"

And you may go get them.

They go in and

take his pants and hanging right alongside of them is another

17

pair of pants.

That is right, your Honor.

Bloody pants, and it has got a name-tag in them

Yes, your Honor.

Q

I suppose in that event you would concede that

9 Frazier!

they could seise Frazier's pants?
A

That is right.

Because that closet is jointly

occupied and used by the two and, therefore, either one of

them have the power to consent»

If they had opened the pocket first and found

MR, SPECTER:

Mr, Chief Justice Warren, and may it

please the Court.
Taking up first the initial argument advanced by the
Petitioner with respects to the statements by the District
Attorney in the. opening speech, I think that the record makes
26

1

it perfectly plain that this item is even less than what has

2

been characterised by this Court to be a minor lax in the

3

course of a. very criminal trial.

4

The statement made by the District Attorney at the

5

outset amounted to some two pages in the record and five lines.

Who made the request of you?

A

The request of me by Roger Rook, the District

Attorney of Clackamas County, who is in the courtroom today.

Is he authorized to speak for the State of

Oregon, a situation of this kind, or is it the Attorney General
who is authorized to "Yes, I am going to speak for them."

Do you vouch for that as a matter of Oregon law?

I think I had best turn to Mr. Rook to get

6

confirmation of it.

7

MR. ROOK:

Actually this is the Attorney General's

8

position since it is on writ of habeas corpus, your Honor.

9

However, we are working with the Attorney General, and the

Attorney General has turned this matter over to me, as

District Attorney of Clackamas County.

Association to have Mr. Specter appear on behalf of the State

15

of Oregon in this matter.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

That is a little unusual

17

way to proceed, it seems to me, because, for instance, we are

18

entitled to know if the representative of the State of Oregon

19

is prepared to vouch for Oregon law and Oregon practice and so

20

forth, and 1 was just wondering, as I am sure other members of

21

the Court are, whether you are in a position to do that or not,

22

or whether any vouchment that you give for a legal situation in

23

Oregon would be in any way binding on Oregon.

24
25

MR, SPECTER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I am

thoroughly familiar with all matters which are raised in this

case, I think both as to the Federal principles and the Oregon

principles, and 'I have consulted with Mr. Rook about the

10

to make plain my position here, sir.

Yes, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

16
17

Correct, your Honor.

Very well.

You may

proceed.
MR. SPECTER:

The point that I think is most important

on the first argument of the petitioner is that the entire
sequence of events concerning the opening statement made by
Mr. Rook and the amount of time that the co-indictee was on
the stand involved a very small portion of this extensive trial.
Measured by the transcript itself, the opening state­
ment of the two pages and five lines and the time when Rawls
was on the stand amounted to somewhat less than three pages, a
29

1

total of some five pages on a transcript which runs more than

2

If000 pages so that this item accounted for no more than one-

3

half of one percent of this entire trial»
The questions which were asked of Mr. Rawls when he

4

5
6
7
8

took the stand amounted to only two in number, neither of which
was incriminating, substantially less than that which was asked
the witnesses in Namet versus the United States when there were
four and where those questions did go to incriminating items.
The reference made by Mr. Rook in his opening speech

9
10

11
12

13
14
15
16

did not involve any direct reference to a confession at all.
There was a reference to a statement and there was not even
a clear reference to a written statement and the matter was
raised immediately after the opening statement on the defendant8 s
motion for a mistrial and as it appears on page 48 of the
printed transcript, the Court noted "It wasn9t ray observation
that the District Attorney was reading from anything.

17
And Mr. Rook responded, "I was not.

A

Yes, your Honor, he did have it in his hand.

As it is I think fair to say that he had many papers in his
22
hands as he was making his opening statement, but he never

3

which is something very different from having a witness on the

4

stand as there was a witness on the stand in Douglas where the

5

prosecutor goes over a statement and says, "Now, isn't this

6

what you said?”

7

with a plea of privilege under the Fifth Amendment,

To which the witness consistently responds

For this is enormously different from what happened

8
S

He is outlining what he intends to prove

in Bruton where there was a co-defendant in the course of a

10

robbery case to testify so then there is a cautionary instruc­

11

tion,

12

I think it is important to note that in the context

13

of the opening, there were two other matters deemed by the

14

defense lawyer to be of substantial importance, whereas the

15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

comments which Mr. Rook made about the testimony that he in­
tended to produce from Mr, Rawls was not objected to at all,
in the course of that opening statement.
Although tit was one of the grounds for a mistrial
advanced by defense counsel immediately after the opening
statement was concluded so I am not saying that there was no
timely objection made,

I am merely putting it in the context

of the opening statement where there was an interruption and
an objection by defense counsel on the question of Mr. Rook’s
intention to use the statement of the defendant, Mr. Frazier.
And there was an interruption and objection by
32

i

defense counsel on the reference to the items of clothing

2

which had been the subject of search and seizure»

3

But when it came to this question about Mr. Rook's

4

reference to what he intended to produce through the testimony

5

of the co-defendant, there was at that point no objection at

6

all.
Q

7

But when the motion

for a mistrial was made and

8

concluded to Rawls' reference, what was the basis of the motion

9

in that respect?
A

10

The basis for the motion at that time, Mr.

1!

Justice Harlan, was that the prosecuting attorney, Mr. Rook,

12

had reason to know that the witness, Mr. Rawls, would not fake

13

the stand and, therefore, would plead the privilege of self-

14

incrimination and, therefor®, it would not be before the jury.

15

And this matter was inquired into fully and appears

16

in terms of Mr. Rook's reply at page 82 of the printed trans­

17

cript.

18

why he believed that Mr. Rawls was going to testify.

And Mr. Rook made reference to three specific reasons

And. those three reasons were;

19

Mo. 1, that Lieutenant

20

Thomas, of the Sheriff's Office reported to me ~ this was his

21

testimony — that he felt sure that Mr. Rawls was going to

22

testify.

23

Next he received a statement from Mr. Ore of the

24

Probation Office that Mr. Rawls was going to testify and did

25

not want to take the Fifth.
33

!

And, third, that Rawls' two brothers and/or mother

1

2

■— 1 am not sure of that from the record here — at least two

3

of them or three of them had talked to him and advised me that

4

although counsel advised him not to testify, he thought he

5

wanted to testify and he was going to testify0
And Mr. Rook on the next page says, "I am talking

6
7

about the information I had in my head at the time that these

8

events occur.*'

9

for the defense counsel thinking, based on information that he

And, of course, it is not an unusual procedure

10

may have had perhaps at an earlier day that the plea of

11

privilege would be entered to attempt to dissuade the prose­

12

cutor from going ahead with that line of evidence.

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Q

This took place right after the opening state­

A

These references, Mr. Justice Harlan, took place

ment?

immediately after Mr. Rawls was placed on the stand.
Q

X see.

A

So that there is a detailing in terms of what

Mr. Rook knew which X think was the more germane time when he
actually put him on the stand and that is what he had as he
put it in his head at that time.
X think that if the petitioner's point is adopted on
this line that there would be a very substantial undercutting
of the prosecutor's right to make an opening speech.

And X

think this case illustrates it very well because there were
34

1

objections made to three points,, two of them actually directed

2

to the course of the speech and the third one afterwards.

3

Now three of theessential points of evidence which

4

was going to put forward, first the defendant statement itself,

5

second the expected testimony of the co-defendant, and third,

6

an outline of the evidence which had been subject to search

1

and seizure.
Now, any one of these points might have been rendered

8
9

inadmissible, although the search and seizure point had been

10

cleared through a pretrial motion.

But if we were to take the

11

position of defense counsel at the trial that a prosecutor could

12

not go into these items, it is plain from this case, that th©

13

major substance of what the prosecutor was going to talk about

14

to the jury would be stricken from the scope of his opening

15

speech„
And I think that the right of the prosecutor to

16
17

make that opening outline is a very crucial one whan the prose™

18

cution has the burden of proof, when the facts very frequently

19

are disjointed, when there has to be some outline to be

20

followed to give the jury some thread as to what is coming, and

21

how they fit into the overall picture, disconnected bits of

22

evidence, and if the defense position were to be upheld here,

23

then on the facts of this case I think it is perfectly plain

24

that -~

25

Q

1 was wondering, Mr, Specter, if they merely
35

1

wanted to advise the jury what they were doing* why it wouldn8fc

2

have been sufficient for him to say that he was going to call

3

this man to the witness stand.

4

S
6

Why was it necessary to tell the jury that it was
going to put on a confession he made out of court?
A

Hell* Mr. Chief Justice Warren* I think because

7

there has to be a thread as to what happened when the three

3

men were together, Mr. Frazier, Mr. Rawls and Mr. Marleau.

9

That is the crucial time in this case.

10

I would want to make one thing perfectly plain and

11

that is that Mr. Rook never referred to a confession at all by

12

Mr. Rawls, never said it was a confession.

13

He said Rawls had made a statement and I think it is

14

a fair inference, as Mr. Justice Marshall points out, that he

15

had a written statement to that effect.

16

was a confession and he then proceeded to outline what happened

17

when those three men were together.

18
19

20

But he never said it

He faced precisely that problem when he was to make
references to the statement of the defendant, Mr. Frazier,
there again, he had identical problems, how much detail does

21

a prosecutor go into in outlining what he intends to prove

22

through that witness.

23

And I submit to your Honor that you really have to

24

at that point what is going to transpire in the case if they

25

facts which are present»

I have great difficulty with two of your posi­

3

tions.

4

now I understand your argument is very important.

5

One is, you started off that this was de minimus and

A

I am saying, yes, the testimony is important had

it gotten in.

7

Q

No.

8

A

Yes, sir,

9

I am talking about the opening statement,
1 am arguing that it is one of three

crucial parts of the prosecutor's case but the way it unfolded

10

before this jury it was not put before this jury to any sig­

11

nificant extent.

12

abbreviated form, in five pages out of a 1,000 page record.

13

It was put to the jury in a very, very

And that is why I say even though this point was of

14

crucial importance to the prosecution, ifc was not put before

15

the jury in any detail at all.

16

of the opening speech of some 28 pages in the transcript, this

17

occupied about one-seventh.

18

Q

The record will show that out

Well, than if we say that you shouldn't use

19

that one-seventh or one-one hundredth of one percent, that

20

wouldn't wreck all of the future opening statements ©f prose­

21

22
23
24
25

cutors in Oregon would it?
A

Well, yes, sir, I submit that it would,

I respectfully submit that it would because how is a
prosecutor to know when he is making his opening speech what
evidence is not to b© available to him that afternoon or the
37

i

next day or a week later.

2

there may be a witness who flees the jurisdiction, there may be

There may be a death of a witness,

3

4

Q

Hone of which

is in this case?

5

A

No, sir,

it is not, but this is the import

No,

6

I submit to your Honor as to what would happen here.

Or, a

7

witness who we have positive reason to think is going to

8

testify on the day of the opening speech and then changes his

S

mind the next day, which is a not infrequent occurrence,

10

Q

Well this one

is the confession in his hand?

11

A

Your Honor, this is a written piece of paper in

12

his hand that he refers to in terms of i^hat a witness is going

13

to testify to who is called,
Q

14

Maybe I am not getting it through.

The witness

15

is not going to testify to this confession, is he?

16

either going to put the confession in or put the witness on

17

the stand.
A

18
19

You would

have to put the witness on the stand.
Q

20
21

You cannot put the confession in.

You are

Very well.

So what you are doing is waving

a confession that you don't ever intend to put in evidence?
A

22

No, your Honor, 1 do not think that is what was

23

done here.

And the bast indication that that is not what was

24

done here is what the trial court said on the motion for a

25

mistrial immediately afterward, where contemporaneously put
38

1

this event* the trial judge said that there was not a reference

2

to the written statement.

3

I submit to your HCTnor, at the very most what was done

4

here was that -this piece of paper was held in the hands of the

5

District Attorney just as he would hold his own sheath of notes

6

and that it is all written here as to what he said and he did

7

not make any reference to this being a statement, word by word,

8

as to what this man had said, certainly no reference at all to

9

the issue of a confession.

to

I think the strongest indication that this item was

11

not of real consequence in this trial is the absence of a

12

request by the defense for a cautionary instruction.

13

cautionary instruction, of course, may serve to remind the jury

14

as to what has occurred and a cautionary instruction may not be

15

observable by a jury.

16

A

But I think it is a fair inference from this record

17

there was a calculated decision made and I think perhaps a wise

18

one from a trial point of view by the defense attorney that

19

there would be no request for a cautionary instruction because

20

this portion of the trial was so minimal that the defendant

21

was better off having it not referred to than he was getting an

22

instruction that the jury should disregard this kind of avi~

23

dence, as was done for enample in United States versus Mamet.

24

So that I think that really puts in perspective the

25

question here as to the factor that it was not of really
39

1

2
3

substantial importance in the course of this trial.
Q

What references, if any, were made to this

episode of Rawls8 on summation?

4

A

None.

Absolutely none.

5

Q

By neither side?

6

A

By neither side.

And the Court gave a general

7

charge that statements of counsel were not to be regarded as

8

evidence from Hornbook procedures, so that that was present,

9

and perhaps, more importantly, Mr. Rook's whole tenor of his

10

opening made it pleiin that he was making representations as

11

to what he intended to prove.

12

1 would like, if I may, to deal directly with the

13

question of search and seizure before coming to the perhaps

14

substantial consideration on the Escobedo argument.

15
10

17
18

X think that the facts in this case show rather
emphatically that the police officers were justified in going
through this duffel bag where they had no indication that it
in fact belonged to Mr. Frasier, the defendant in this case,

19

that the duffel bag is something of limited size, not knowing

20

which compartment who's clothes were in and then came upon

2!

these items of clothing which had in fact been worn by the

22

defendant, Mr. Frasier, blood-spotted stains of clothing.

23
24
25

And under the decision of Harris versus United States
last year by this Court coming upon objects falling in the
plain view of an officer, that there certainly was a right to
40

1

take those items and use them in the course of the trial.

2

duffel bag# the search of the duffel bag had been consented to

3

by both Mr. Rawls and by Mr. Rawls' mother# the aunt of the

4

defendant, and I think it was well within the ambit of per­

5

missibility on search and seizure.

0

The

The question on the statement presents some greater

7

difficulty but I would submit to your Honors first of all that

8

the facts of this situation are well within the ambit of

9

permissibility under the Escobedo decision.

10

Thera was the single statement by this defendant,

13

Mr. Frasier, that he was about to get himself into more trouble,

12

but he had been advised early in the course of the questioning

13

that he coisld have an attorney, if he wanted an attorney, "Why

14

you can have one.”

15
16

And the police further said, "What you say here could
be used against you in a trial.

Do you understand that?"

17

And there was an affirmative answer, "Yes."

18

1 think that the case is put in real perspective by

19

the argument by petitioner's counsel when he comes to this

20

question of was the will of the defendant, Mr. Frazier, overborn

21

by aggressive interrogation.

22

And I would submit to your Honors, that this is a

23

classical case to show from a tape recording which was made at

24

the time of this interrogation, which is reprinted in full,

25

that there was an abundance of fairness and there was an

I would submit to your Honors that if the Court eoniludes that the statement of the defendant Frasier is not within
he purview of the Escobedo decision, that the Court reverse
Iscobedo and adopt in its place the standards which are set
orth in the Crime Control Act adopted by Congress last June»
I would submit to your Honors that this really puts
,nto a focus the test which has been suggested here by counsel
or petitioner as to whether the confession was voluntary in its
ntirefcy, the Federal Crime Control Act is now the law of the
and, presumptively constitutional, and certainly a more
tringent standard should not be applied to the States than that
hich is applied to the Federal Government.

very sound statistical basis for concluding ™

I think that

this argument is one which could have originally, in the

5

of 1968 which —

6

Q

Is it briefed here?

A

No, your Honor, it is not briefed.

8

Q

It has just come in since you came in the case?

0

A

Yes, your Honor.

10

Q

I see.

11

A

The statistical base to which I was referring has

12

provided a very strong basis for a conclusion by the Congress.

13

Of that there have been substantial reductions in the number of

14

confessions and statements, post Miranda, and in the balancing

15

process which is the essential ingredient on determining

16

constitutionality I would suggest that that determination Should

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

be accorded great weight.
Q

Is this an argument they overruled and argued?

A

Yes, it is an argument to overrule Escobedo,

Mr. Justice Brennan, and which would necessarily involve an
overruling of Miranda because the Escobedo rules are less
stringent on law enforcement than Miranda, but we are faced
with here is the Escobedo rule as opposed to the Miranda rule.

MR. FEUERSTEIN:

Mr, Chief Justice, I would merely

say that it is true that the District Attorney did not refer
to this as a confession and in fact it was really an exculpa­
tory statement in which the supposed accomplice placed all the

[

blame on Frasier, and throughout this opening statement such
phrases as, "This is

Rawls* version and Rawls said that he

tripped trying to rob the bank" he said, and the reporter put
in quotes, "We took all the clothes off after we got home and
put them in the travel bag," was perfectly clear to anyone
hearing the opening statement that Rawls had made a statement
to the police and that the District Attorney was telling the
jury what this statement was.
And there was no way in the world which the defense

j
could test that version of Rawls by cross-examination because
Rawls refused to testify.

The same would have been true of

completely unexpected if Rawls had died and not testified at all„
Q

Was the tape recording played to the jury?
f

A

It was played to the judge in chambers in ruling

24

on the confession.

Is it part of the record?

Was there an offer to introduce in evidence that

15

was objected to?
A

I am not sure whether — I think the tape

the hearing on the voluntariness of the confession.
It was never presented to the jury or played before

Q

Had it been a surreptitious tape recording?

that is5 I perhaps didn61 use — did the defendant know that

Apparently he did.

that what was on the tape would be orally placed in evidence
