ARGUMENT OF RICHARD F. WATT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7

9

MR. WATT;

If the Court please, somewhat over 20 years

ago I appeared before this Court and argued the case of MadDcuga 11

10

versus Green in x^hich an effort was being made to have declared

11

unconstitutional a statute of the State of Illinois with regard

12

to the right of new parties to a place on the general election

13

ballot for statewide candidates.

14

In that case, which was decided by this Court on

IS

October 21, 1948, a majority of the Court held in a pro curiam

16

opinion that the particular statute involved was constitutional

17

as a reasonable exercise of the State's power, and specifically

18

it held that it was proper for purposes of the requirements of

19

a new party getting on the ballot that the State could require

20

25,000 signatures, of which there must be not less than 200

21

signatures from at least 50 different counties.

22
23
24

£5

In the State of Illinois there are 102 counties, and
the population facts which were set out in the opinion then are
substantially the same as they are now except that the disparity
between the more populous counties of Illinois and the less
2

1

populous counties has somewhat increased.

2

We have here, before this Court today virtually the same

3

statute, not on behalf of a new party, but on behalf of indepen­

4

dent candidates who sought to have themselves placed on the gen­

5

eral election ballot as candidates for positions of electors of

6

President and Vice President of the United States in the last

7

general election.
We are asking this Court now to re-examine MacDougall

3

9

versus Green and to determine that it should be overruled.
The issue is precisely the same;

10

Is it proper for a

11

State, as a condition of candidates getting on the ballot who

12

are not the candidates of one of the established political par­

13

ties, is it permissib3-e for the State to impose, in addition to

14

numerical standards, is it permissible that the State require

15

that the number of voters who signify their determination to put

16

candidates on the ballots must be distributed in a certain

17

fashion throughout the State, based on where those voters reside.
Q

18
13

Court in MacDougall against Green, is it not?
A

20
21
22

23
24

This is the precise statute that was before the

The wording is the same, Your Honor.

The only

difference is that there it was Section IQ.2 of the Illinois
Election Code, which dealt with new parties, and here it is
Section 10.3, which deals with independent candidates.

Otherwise

it is precisely the same.
Q

25

The same statutory provisions as that one, identic

ally
3

1

A

Yes, it is.

2

Q

Well, I suppose you would agree that the answer

3

to that, question might be different, depending upon the natura

4

of the geographical distribution required, so that if that is so,

5

we don't have before us merely the small proposition that you

t

6

have now stated, but may we not also, or alternatively, have

7

before us that proposition in the context of the fact that here

8

you have such a tremendous disparity? that is to say, only about

9

6.6 percent of the Illinois registered voters reside in 53 of

10

the counties.

Is that correct?

11

A

That is correct,

12

Q

I assume that you are not saying that we have to

13

base our decision solely on the abstraction that you put to us

14

a moment ago.
A

15

I think that is correct, Your Honor.

I would say

16

this:

In the dissent that Mr. Justice Douglas wrote in MacDougaU

17

versus Green, there is the suggestion that it might be permis­

18

sible to require a distribution of signatures, provided that the

19

distribution was proportionate to the population of the geographic

20

areas involved,
So I suppose you could state that if 25,000 signatures

21

22

were required, it would be permissible for the State at that

23

point to say those 25,000 signatures must be distributed through­

24

out the State in proportion to the voting population of the

25

various counties.
correct

That particular issue is not here.
4

That is

1

Q

Well, what is here, though, is that, there is this

2

question in the specific context of the demographic facts in the

3

State of Illinois, the distribution of people among the counties.

4

Here you could get, let's see, over 90 percent, of the voters of

5

the State and still not comply with that statute.

Q
7
8

9

A

That is correct.

You could not get candidates

on the ballot under those circumstances.
Q

You might have another State in which a statute

of this sort might work without that rather startling consequencs

10

if you had the population distributed more or less equally among

11

the requisite number of counties.

12

A

That is correct, but I think I would interpret

13

this Court's decision in Reynolds versus Simms as indicating fchab

14

absent some remarkable showing of the purpose of geographic

15

distribution of voters, that if the unit with respect to which

16

the candidates are concerned, let us say statewide, that then

17

the validity and effect of a voter's indication of his intent

18

should have nothing to do with where he lives.

19

Since we elect, in Illinois, the candidates for state­

20

wide office on a statewide basis, it would seem to me there is a

21

good reason for arguing that if you began imposing even soma

22

geographic distribution

23

dition of putting the candidates on the ballot, this might well,

24
25

proportionate to population as a con­

in itself, be invalid procedure.
Q

I understand your position, I think.

5

You want to

1

go for broke, or more or less to go for broke, on the straight

2

numerical basis, but 1 assume you do agree that there is at

3

least a theoretical possibility and alternative which is tied to

4

the rather striking facts in the State of Illinois with respect

5

to the unequal distribution of population»
A

6

I would agree with that, Your Honor»

I think to

7

a certain extent, the Court has already , in some of its decisions,

8

as you describe it, "’gone for broke" insofar as it has indicated

9

the irrelevancy of geographic location of where a voter happens

10

to live»
It makes no difference, it should make no difference,

11
12

how much his vote counts, depending on whether he lives in a

13

small county or a large county,
Q

14

Of course, those cases arose under the equal

15

protection clause.

The constitutional context of this case is

1G

not the protection clause, is it?

17

it is.

It is Article II, or whatever

It is Presidential Electors, isn't it?

18

A

That is correct.

19

Q

Where you have a specific provision in the Con­

20

21
22
23
24
25

stitution that deals with that.
A

But there is no requirement in the Constitution

as to manner in which States shall provide for the nomination
of Presidential Electors«
Q

Well, Mr. Watt, does this statute apply only to

Presidential Electors?

6

1

A

Not it does not.

2

Q

All statewide offices, isn“fc it?

O

A

All stafcevxide offices.

<-J

The only reason that we

4

are here concerned only v/ith Presidential Electors is because

5

the petitions which were filed were sixapiy petitions for the

6

nomination of 26 Presidential Electors from the State of Illinois,

7

Q

All I am getting at, your submission is that we

8

have a broader problem here than just that which relates to the

9

choice of Presidential Electors,

10

A

It affects; all independent candidates for state­

11

wide office in the State of Illinois, and that would be United

12

States Senator, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and so on»

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Well, is your basic argument that 25,000 signatures

should suffice, wherever the 25,000 happen to live?
A

That is correct»

I would not say that the State

could not impose a different numerical total as a proper condi­
tion for getting on the ballot, and the statute prior to 1935 in
Illinois simply required the total of 25,000,

There was an

amendment in 1935 which added the geographical distribution,
Q

I understand, and you just say the geographical

addition is unconstitutional,
A

Correct, in violation of the equal protection, and

basically in line with the dissenting opinion

Mr. Justice

Douglas wrote in MacDougall versus Green, and that view, at leas£
as we see it, has been adopted by this Court in Reynolds versus
7

1

Simms, and subsequent eases.

2

The decision below was based substantially upon the

3

binding effect of MacDougall versus Green.

The three-judge cour t

4

which heard the matter took the position that if MacDougall ver­

5

sus Green was to be viewed as no longer the law* that it should

Q

not be the task of the three-judge court to make that decision.
In our argument before the three-judge court by briefs

7

7

S

we contended that Reynolds versus Simms has substantially under­

9

cut the theory by which this Court,, in MacDougall versus Green*

10

upheld the statutory requirement.
The view of this Court at that time was that it -was

11
12

perfectly permissible for a State, as a condition of permitting

13

candidates on the ballot by nomination petition, to show that

14

those candidates had support which was not confined to one geo­

15

graphic area.
As Mr. Justice Fortas pointed out, the population

16
17

IS
19

20
21
22
23

24
25

statistics of Illinois are really rather startling.

Well over

50 percent of the registered voters reside in one county, Cook
County.

Well over 60 percent reside in the five most populous

counties, and the 49 most populous counties have approximately
percent of the registered voters, which means that any com.bination of voters, no matter how you distribute them, from thos 2
49 counties, could not, under this statute, put independent
candidates or new party candidates on the ballot.
have to have signatures from additional counties.

8

They would

1

One of the necessary effects of this — and 1 think

2

anybody who has ever had anything to do with nomination peti­

3

tions in which signatures are required — it is always desirable

4

when you file petitions to have a surplus of signatures.

5

turn out that some of the people who sign think that they are

6

registered voters when, in fact, they are not.

7

that some individuals have moved from one residence to another

3

and that their registered voting residence is different from

3

what they put on the petition»

It may

It may turn out

It may be that some signatures are illegible and, con­

10
11

sequently, you cannot be absolutely certain that if you just

12

file 25,000 that you will have a sufficient number of valid sig­

13

natures.

14

would naturally want to have some margin.

15

Consequently, anyone preparing petitions of this kind

But you could have any size of margin of additional

16

signatures from Cook County or any one of 49 other counties, and

17

none of those signatures would be sufficient to put you over the

18

top, so to speak.

13

signatures and, in effect, those additional signatures would not

20

count, so that at a certain point an individual from Cook County

21

who signs a petition of this kind is, in effect, having his

22

signature simply disregarded because it is irrelevant to the

Nov;, you could have hundreds of thousands of

*•

23
24
25

requirement and it will not count, so to speak, to offset the
lack of signatures from any of the other counties.
It seems to me under those circumstances that, you have
9

1

essentially the same kind of problem as this Court' has concerned

2

itself with where; you have gross malapportionment*

3

ive weight of one voter's indication of his positions, whether-by

4

signing a nomination petition or by voting, really depends upon

5

where he lives*

S

if he lives in a large county, it may not count at all.

7

The effect­

If he lives in a small county, it will count?

As we read Reynolds versus Simms, this Court has deter­

8

mined as a general principle that the; weight of a citizen's vote

9

cannot be made to depend upon where he lives.

10
11

12

Q

Did the Reynolds against Simms opinion of the

Court deal with the MacDougall case, do you remember?
A

The MacDougall case is cited in Footnote 40, Mr.

13

Justice Douglas’ dissent is cited, and the only way I can de­

14

scribe it, it seems to me that the principles set out by Mr.

15
16
17
18
19

20
2!
22
23
24
25

Justice Douglas’ dissent are cited approvingly by the majority
of this Court in Reynolds versus Slnuns.
Q

And that was the extent of the treatment of

MacDougall versus Green.
A

That was the extent of the treatment of the

decision itself.
Q

Because I seem to remember in Baker against Carr

there was more extensive treatment.
A

There was a discussion of the significance of

MacDougall versus Green insofar as it possibly was the first
case of this kind of political problem in which the Court decided
10

1

the issue on the merits, x"ather than simply saying that this was

2

the kind of political thicketing to which the Court would not go

3

So in 1948 I think it is fair to say MacDougall versus Green

4

decided the issue on the merits, and did not take the “out81 of

S

considering it as non-jusfcicabla»

6

Q

So what do you do with the Dusch case?

7

A

I think that is different in this sense, Your

Q

There the requirement was that a candidate had to

3

Honor

9
10

live in a certain district, so there was a geographical qualifi­

11

cation on the candidate himself»
A

12

That is correct.

But they were elected at large

13

by the votes of all the citizens who were eligible to vote over­

14

all in the community, even though the candidates •— there had

IS

to be candidates geographically spaced,

16

of a voter's vote had nothing to do with where he happened to

17

live»

13

Q

30

to speak — the effec

Here it is not the candidate, but his supporters

19

who have to live certain places, and unless they live in certain

20

places he canGt even get. on the ballot; is that it?

21

A

22

Now, as I understand the position taken by the State

23
24

25

That is correct.

of Illinois in asking that this decision of the court below be
affirmed, it is essentially, first, that we really don't have an
election here; that in Illinois, Presidential Electors get on

11

1

the ballot, so far as established parties are concerned, by the

2

action of State conventions and, therefore, there is nothing in

3

the nature of a primary to get them on the ballot.

4

placed on the ballot by virtue of official action of a State

5

convention0

6

They are

Secondly, that here we are concerned with nomination

7

petitions,

and not the equivalent of an election,

It seems to

8

me that argument simply cannot stand because the question is

9

whether or not the procedure is an essential and integral part

10

of the election process»

11

on the ballot under a statutory scheme, that statutory scheme

12

is part of the election machinery.

13

tion or if it is by primary election, it seems to me the stan­

14

dard should be precisely the same? namely, what is the effect

15

of a voter doing something?

IQ

However an individual gets officially

If it is by nomination peti­

It cannot seem logical to me, at least, that he must

17

have his vote counted regardless of where he lives, and his vote

18

must count equally with the vote of every other voter, if it is

19

a primary election that is concerned, but that it is perfectly

20

all right to discriminate against him and weight the votes of

21

some individuals when what you are counting are signatures on

22

a nomination petition.

23
24
25

It seems to me that the process is essentially part of
the election machinery

sjv3

it should meet the same standards.

The second argument that the State makes is that
12

1

somehow or other what we are seeking would interfere with the

2

scheme for independent candidates and new party candidates»

3

really don't understand that argument because, as 1 suggested a

4

moment before, the original requirement in Illinois prior to

5

1935 was simply 25,000 signatures, regardless of where they cams

6

from in the State, and the only effect of a decision here deter­

7

mining the unconstitutionality of the amendment would, as has

8

been determined by many Illinois cases, leave the underlying

9

statute intact and, therefore, if this amendment were determined

I

10

to be unconstitutional, the underlying statutory scheme of 25,003

11

signatures for statewide candidates would continue as a perfectly

12

valid enactment of the State Legislature»
But we do not think that a decision by this Court in

13
14

any respect would interfere with a perfectly understandable and

15

valid procedure, and that the only effect of the Court's deci­

16

sion overruling MacDougall versus Green would be to eliminate

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

an unconstitutional restriction upon the nomination process by
petition»
So we would ask this Court to do what we think the
•/

Court, in effect, has already done? that is, by its decisions in
such cases as Gray versus Sanders, and Reynolds versus Simms,
to recognise that this kind of geographic requirement which has
the necessary effect of giving more weight to one voter9s influ­
ence than to another's, should be considered unconstitutional,
regardless of whether all we are concerned with is a nomination
13

1

process by petition, inasmuch as the petitions are an essential

2

means for new party and independent party candidates to get on

3

the balloto

7

10

Thank

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
At the outset I would like to thank the Court for your

12

permission in granting us leave to present twocounsel*,

13

would like to further elaborate and say that this reason we did

14

so request, even though the rule is quite clear, is because Mr.

15

Richard Friedman has been working very closely with election

16

laws for many, many years in the State of Illinois and perhaps

his presence hare will be helpful to the Court on some questions
Basically, what we have here is what we think is a
very reasonable and workable method for allowing individuals and
new political parties to gain a position on the ballot in the
State of Illinois.
We have an attack on our statutory method of doing so
based upon what we think is an unwarranted application of oneman/one -vote .
Essentially, counsel was very correct in that, although
14

1

this case merely reflects specifically as to electors, it does

2

affect our entire nominating procedure in the State of Illinois,

3

As Mr, Justice Harlan referred to, Article II, Section

4

1, Clause 2 of our Constitution permits the State Legislatures

5

to set up nominating provisions for electors.

1

we have set up a system whereby any existing political party who

3

has garnered five percent of the vote in the last general elec­

9

tion can nominate, by party convention, its electors or other

10

11

Pursuant to that

State officials to be elected.
We also have a. provision for new political parties to

12

gain a place on the ballot

Green has been cited since its decision 20 years ago mainly for

22

the proposition that it was the first case which said "We, the

24

to elections," which they had previously not taken jurisdiction of

In relation to the question propounded by Mr, Justice

2

Forfcas, in view of the 6,6 debasement which counsel has set forfei

3

as being the basis of the unconstitutionality, if we were to

4

assume that one-man/one-vote applied in this situation, what we

5

tried to say was this: that counsel wants us to take off the

6

200 signatures from 50 counties and just leave 25,000 signatures

7

from anyplace, or one county.
If that were accomplished, we can go into counties in

8
9

a corner of our State which can be 400 miles away from any other

10

portion of the State, from Cook County, let us say, and we can

11

debase the vote of 99,5 percent of those living in the other

12

counties, because we can garner one-half of one percent from one

13

county having 25,000 or more electors, people who are registered

14

to vote,
We suggest that that, in view of the dissent in Mac-

15
16
17
18

Oougall, under one-raan/one-vote, would create an unconstitutional
situation which would be of greater significance than counsel
suggests exists now.

Q

Why do you say that would debase the vote of the

Well, basically the argument is this: that people

living in 50 counties reprasen ing 6.6 percent of the population
can put someone on the ballot who is not acceptable to 93.4 per­
cent of the people,

I suggest that if you-remove that —

Q

1sn81 it the other way around?

3

it, the argument is that people who live in 50 of the counties

4

with less than seven percent of the population can prevent the

5

remaining people in the State from putting somebody on the bal

o

lot*
A

7

In relation to the argument stated from that

8

point, I would have to say that while it might be possible, it

9

certainly is not probable that an individual, a serious candi­

10

date, could not garner 200 signatures, and that \m would have au

11

a conspiracy existing in 53 counties that would block anyone

from getting on the ballot,

basing the vote of people throughout most of the State?

Basically, and on his argument stated in the

converse, as I originally stated it, that 93.4 percent could h&V2
someone on the ballot that was not acceptable to them? likewise,
99.5 percent could have someone on the ballot that was not

The second basic issue in this matter is whether or

There is no precise or objective test which may be
applied to a situation such as this, but there are a number of
elements, a number of concepts, Which may be applied to this
particular type of balancing problem.
To begin with, is there a showing of some voter in­
terest by the candidate? and further, is this substantial in­
terest manifest prior to the time of the election?

Also, does

the candidate have some party structure, some political organi­
zation, upon which he bases his candidacy.
23

*i

But these three conceptual elements, I think, are all

2

bound together further by the question of the experience of the

3

State of Illinois, and more than that, the practicality or the

4

pragmatics of the situation»

5

A

State legislative policy is composed of a number of

Q

elements.

7

are the peculiar problems of its geography?

8

tudes of its people?

9

which may be variables which could be introduced into this mix.

For example, what is the history of the State?

State legislative objective is also based on apprecia­

10

11

tion of the people of the State of Illinois of a particular

political theory, or a particular political concept.

13

stitution does not compel the State to adopt any particular

14

political philosophy or political theory which underlies the

15

legislative objective which is served by this requirement.
What, then, are the legislative objectives which are

'16
17

The Con­

served by this requirement?
To begin with, I think there is a requirement that a

18

19

serious candidate must show some voter interest in his candidacy

20

and the reason for this may be based in part on a political

21

theory:

22
23
24
25

Illinois.

appreciation of a legislative objective by the State of
I would define it as the majority-plurality theory.
Based in part, it would be in a situation where there

is a third-party candidacy.

It very well may be that 'the candi­

date with the highest number of votes may not obtain a majority.
24

1

He may merely win by a plurality.

2

that in combination, a third party may actually prefer the party

3

with the second highest number of votes and, in combination, the

4

two together may actually win, or it is conceivable that they

5

could have won by a majority.
This, I suggest to you, is one possible political

6
7

theory which may be accepted by the State of Illinois.
Q

8
9

It follows as a possibility,

It is a pretty clumsy one to get at this objective,

this provision.
A

10

I don't suggest that that, by itself, Mr. Justice,

11

is the whole answer.

I would hope that we could regard the situa­

12

tion in its whole context.
We get into another area of experience, and I suggest

13
14

this to you:

15

in 1935, and it was first imposed for the Presidential election

16

of 1936.

17
18
13

The requirement was adopted by the General Assembly

In 1932, the Presidential election immediately prior to

the imposition of this requirement,

there were four independent

candidacies on the ballot in Illinois. In 1936, the first year
after the imposition —

20

Q

For the Presidency?

21

A

Well, it xtfas for the Presidency? it was also for

22
23
24
25

other offices, as well, other statewide offices, so I think it
is quite apt.

It is in its broadest view.

But to follow, in 1936,

the experience was that there

were also four independent candidacies.
25

So I am suggesting to

1

you, on a numerical analysis alone, immediately before and im­

2

mediately after the imposition of this requirement, there were

3

four independent candidacies.

4

I don51 think we can demonstrate that a requirement

5

which is rather to meet indicates that such candidacies would

6

flourish? nor does it necessarily follow that a more difficult

7

requirement to meet would Indicate that such candidacies would

8

be moribund.

9

1 am only suggesting to you that in the whole politica

10

context, there are so many variables that enter into a situation

11

at any given time there is no way to project with any degree of

12

accuracy what would or what might occur in, the future, or what

13

would have occurred had not this provision been involved.

14

A second legislative objective to be served v/ould be a

concern by the State of Illinois that any proliferation of inde­

pendent candidacies might tend to confuse the voters.

Williams case from the Illinois situation.

19

I would

In Ohio there was a requirement that there be signa­

20

tures from 15 percent of the voters.

21

I think, something like 433,000.

22

figure is that we require only one-half, approximately one-half

23

of one percent of the total voters, or 25,000.

Q'

The numerical figure was,

3

What would the smallest of those 50 counties represent?

I made this analysis, Your Honor, and I don’t know

5

if I can quite meet it»

6

which might be helpful to you®

7

Perhaps I can give you another figure

We have 102 counties.

A 50 percent break would be 52.

8

My study shows that there are 54 counties in the State with more

9

than 15,000 voters.

Perhaps that meets, in part? it doesn’t

Could you break that down into parties as to how •—

15

counties like that would they be overwhelmingly Republican?

16
17
18

A

In

I don’t hava those figures at hand, Your Honor.

I think I can give you a rather close approximation.
In terms of voter registration alone, Cook County has

19

slightly more than 50 percent, the balance of it being, as it

20

is called, "downstate” Illinois, that is, all the counties other

21

than Cook County.

22

Q

Yes.

23

A

The relative vote in Cook County would account for,

24

I would say, perhaps 60 percent of the Democratic votes through­

25

out the State.

The converse would be true with the Republican
27

1

Party.

2

the downstate areas? about 40 percent in Cook County.

3

It would be something like that.

Downstate there would be something like 60 percent in

I am afraid I don't

4

have specific numbers at hand» but that would be the essential

5

weighting of the relative strength of the parties in the various

6

areas of the State.
I would turn now to the third legislative objective

that is served by this requirement, and that would be that a

9

candidate should have his support not limited to a concentrated

The reason for that would be that a candidate runs

State of Illinois.

I suggest to you that this requirement of

obtaining signatures in these counties x^ould almost perfectly
track what a serious political candidate would have to do in
developing an effective campaign.
Q

A "serious political candidate" would not have to

have an organization in every single county in order to win.

your question, it is true that he would have to gather signatures

And that is the reason for it,

Q

Suppose a candidate oh the Democratic ticket got

counties, solid Democratic vote»

How many counties would have to

20

A

I would have to do some rapid calculating.

21

Q

It wouldn91 be many, would it?

A

No, I would think that perhaps — well, let me

23
24
25

answer it in this way.

I think that Cook County, and perhaps

the seven or eight next most populous counties in the State, if
there was a substantial trend for a candidate, I think he would
29

1
2

be assured of being elected»
Q

That is a point for whatever it may mean,, that is

3

to say, that in theory* anyway* a candidate could be elected by

A

But in order for an independent to get on

That is true,

Mr. Justice Fortas, I suggest that

there might be a slightly different focus to this argument»

Here

to

tofore* we have been talking* in response to questions* about the

11

major political parties* the Republican and Democratic Parties»

12

But what we are talking about here is the viability of an inde­

13

pendent candidate* how well he may do through this structure.

14
15
16

I think as a practical matter* in order for him to wim,
he would have to garner at least that many votes.
Q

Well* if he is an independent candidate* though*

17

who represents a splinter* a Democratic splinter* or a Republican

18

splinter* suppose he represented a Democratic splinter.

19

very well be that his appeal would be confined to a very few

20

counties * even though at the time of the election he might have

2?

a formidable vote in the aggregate if he could get on the ballot,

22
23
24
25

It raiglr:

From a pragmatic point of view* it would seem to me
that might be the difficulty.
A

Your Honor* I would say that is true* but in addi­

tion to that* there is one other element of the history of

30

1

independent parties in the State of Illinois that may be helpful

2

to the Court.

3

From the year 1912, through the year 1968, in Presi­

4

dential years, there were 39 independent candidacies.

S

out to approximately 2.6 per time.

that both prior to and subsequent to the imposition of this re­

7

quirement, there have been viable candidacies.

Q

This work 3

So I am suggesting to you

Your requirement doesn’t mean much anyway, even

in serving State interests, if your State* interest is to keep
down too many independent candidacies.
A

Well, 2.6 is the figure that has occurred.

it wa

12

slightly more prior to the imposition of this requirement than

13

after, but it has been sibout the same.

34

Q

Well, what interest does the State have in a

35

system that permits the Democrats of Cook County, just the Demo­

16

crats from one county, operating through their convention, to

17

put a Presidential Elector on the ballot, and all of the indepen

18

dents in Cook County, no matter how many they are, can't get a

19

Presidential Elector on the ballot?

20

A

Once again, the focus of the case before us is

21

not necessarily related to the internal operation of either of

22

the two major political parties.

23
24
25

Q

We are talking solely about —

Well, I am just suggesting that this necessarily

is part of the case, isn’t it, when an independent claims he has

It may be that the

Is part of your argument really that this require

independent candidate.

20

It is an obstacle which must, be overcome, and it

21

has been overcome in a number of instances.

22

objective that could be served would be as I indicated before.

23

The requirement of substantial vot^r interest, concern about

possible proliferation of candidacies, and the like.

Q

The legislative

I suggest they are also a matter of specula­

In the State of Illinois, unfortunately, we do not
have the kind of material which makes it possible to determine

determining legislative history and legislative intent.

also have to take into account the fact that many of them, as

17

potential signers of petitions, are automatically eliminated

18

if they voted in either the Democratic or Republican primary.

19

So this makes the obstacle a little bit tougher to get over.

20

I don't think there is any doubt that this particular

21

requirement can be met, but I also don't think there is any

22

doubt that it has, in a number of instances, kept people from

23

the ballot.

24

Q

25

How do you suggest it could be met to avoid the

constitutional objections you entertain?
34

1

A

I would say the only way that there could he

2

geographic distributive requirements would be if they were pro

3

portions! either to the population of the county or the register sd

4

voters of the county, in line with the suggestion that Mr*

S

Justice Douglas made in his dissent in MacDougall versus Green*

s

But unless that were done, I would say that you would

7

simply have to eliminate all geographic distributive require­

8

ments.

Then how would you have the election?

How would

a new party get in?
A

A new party would get in by filing petitions with

12

the required number of signatures of qualified voters who had

13

not voted in one of the party primaries, and if the total number

14

of ■valid signatures was up to the minimum required, then that

15

group of candidates, or that individual candidate should go on

16

the ballot.

17

Q

From what counties?

18

h

It would make no difference from what counties.

19

Q

Just from the State.

20

A

Just from the State.

Q

Can you think of any other way?

A

Well, I suppose you could have almost any variety

of techniques for getting independents or new party candidates
on the ballot, Mr. Justice Black.

In England, as I understand

it, you pay a deposit and simply sign papers and pay a deposit
35

1

of B20Q for certain offices, and if you fail to get a requisite

2

number of the votes, you forfeit your B20G.

3

that in England they have a terrible problem of proliferation

4

of political parties»

5

I have not heard

I think this is really an unreal fear that is used to

6

justify a technique which realistically has a tendency to monopo

7

lize the ballot to the existing parties»

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN?
