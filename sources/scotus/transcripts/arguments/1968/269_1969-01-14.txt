ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAM HOUSTON CLINTON, JR.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

7

MR. CLINTON:
9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.

|
For just a moment, I would like to put back into

to

It

perspective what we were speaking of yesterday afternoon.

12

These events occurred December 12.

13

plaintiffs filed a complaint in the court below.

Within nine days the

Thereafter, the three-judge court was convened.

14
15

6

16

law enforcement officers in Bell County and the county

17

attorney, moved to dismiss the complaint.

18

About

days after the events occurred, the defendents below, the

Now, certainly, I think, that based upon the allega­

19

tions, the facts that were later shown to support those allega­

2

tions, at the time that the complaint was filed there was a

21

clear case or controversy, and to the extent that it was argued

22

that the court did not have jurisdiction, certainly at that

23

point the court clearly had jurisdiction, because the test is

24

whether there is a substantial controversy of sufficient

25

immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of declaratory

26

1

j udgment.

2

Q

I don't see that the opinion was considered

3

whether on the question of declaratory judgment this record

4

did show a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and

5

reality.

6

On what do you rely that it did exist?

7

A

I don't know that the court put it in those

9

Q

I don't believe the opinion -—

10

A

We rely for immediacy and reality on the fact

terms.

11

that charges that the disturbing of the peace complaints were

12

filed when it is obvious to anyone \who knows anything about

13

the facts that there was no chance to prove any guilt.

14

They were sent --Q

15

As I understand at, at the time that this opinior

16

was filed for hearing, those complaints had already been

17

withdrawn.

18

A

Yes, but that is only a part of what we rely on.

19

Q

Yes.

20

A

We rely on the whole course of conduct in Bell

21

County from that time right on down including all the harrass-

22

ment:

23

ping, the threathenings, the calling of traitors, all of those

24

things plus the comments of the chief of police:

of those charges?

There is no evidence of that, no evidence,

whatsoever, one way or the other.

effect that it had that these actions --

12

Q

May 1 ask, does the record show whether the com­

13

mittee had demonstrated at any other place in that county,

14

except at Fort Hood, at any time?

15

A

I am not sure that the record does show.

The

16

record shows that the committee has, as its purpose, the

17

appearing for purposes of demonstrations anyplace within the

18

vicinity of 100 miles of the university, where any representa­

19

tives of the administration that were promoting the foreign

20

policy of which the committee opposed would appear --

21

Q

But as far as the record is concerned, the

22

actual demonstration in Bell County was this demonstration

23

on the 12th of December when the President was at Fort Hood?

24
25

A

That is correct.

What we think the defendents

really argued below and their motion says — was the motion
28

1

to dismiss but it was based solely — it was directed solely

2

to the dismissal of that part of the prayer which sought

3

injunctive release against the pending charges,

4

dismiss was not specifically directed to that part of the

5

prayer that sought the injunctive release of restraining

6

enforcement of the declaratory judgment.

7

'rhe motion to

The court was aware of that and pointed out that

8

it was perfectly clear to the court below that they no longer

9

had to consider it our prayer for temporary release as to the

10

I

pending charges since those had been dismissed.
The court went on to say, we think quite correctly,

11
12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

that the motion to dismiss was not specifically directed to
the ultimate prayer for declaratory judgment or for permanent
injunction against enforcement of this statute and then the
court went ahead to find that it was unconstitutional and to
say that we were entitled to injunctive release, but as I
pointed out yesterday did not actually issue any order in the
form of an injunction.
Now, in connection with those pending charges -Q

Did the judgment or the declaratory judgment

and the injunction stand on the same footing, I take it, I mean

21

22

if there is a judgment for one there is a judgment for the

,

23
24
25

I

other, isn't there?
A

I suppose we are dealing in semantics.

The

court handed down an opinion in which it said at the tail end :
29

i

•J

"The plaintiffs are entitled to their declaratory judgment

2

and injunctive release,"
Now, following that there has never been any kind of

3
4

paper entitled "Judgment" that really sets out --

5

Q

But even to be here there has to be a judgment.

6

A

Oh, yes.

7

Q

So there is a judgment.

8

A

To the extent that it is in that opinion, there

3

is a judgment,
Q

10

And it is reviewable here.

But to the extent

11

that it is there it is both for declaratory judgment and

12

injunction.

13

A

Yes, sir, without any specificity as to what

Q

Now that the criminal charges are dismissed

14

15
16
17

their

--

isn't at least the injunctive judgment in error?
A

The court only said we were entitled to an

18

injunction, they have not actually issued one.

19

that the place to take xare of that part of the case is back

20

below if the court, hopefully,affirms a three-man back for the

21

actual preparation of the term.

22

Q

I think, frankl^,

I just asked you if there is a judgment for

23

one there is a judgment for the other, there is a judgment

24

that there isn't and that he is entitled to an injunction.

25

A

Yes.
30

1

Q

Nowf isn't that judgment wrong?

2

A

Well, no, sir, I don't think it is wrong.

I

3

think we have shown that not only did the acts have a chilling ]

4

effect but they completely froze all speech and activity and

5

expression, and that we have shown our

6

irreparable injury as

I thought that this was a matter of comedy.

3

You could expect a State court to recognize that if this

9

statute is bad as the declaratory judgment says it was that the

iO

State court would recognize that this is bad and would recognize

If

some constitutional defense to a prosecution.

12

A

A State court, it is conceivable, might do that

13

and that is one reason I say that we need to take that up with

14

the court below.

15

Sheriff Gunn, will do that or that the justice of the peace

16

will not again require them to post a $500 bond and go through

17

all of those things before we ever get to a court of record

18

who would be aware of the decisions of this court and follow

19

them.

was on an information following the complaint.

is on the information and the JP court is tried upon a complaint

which,

is after the

21

22
23
24
25

We view it as authority for us

controversy between our committee and its members and the
law enforcement officers in Bell County continues to exist.
There is nothing in this record that the sheriff of
Bell County would not once again enforce, or attempt to enforce
against the plaintiffs Article 474 if they went back up there

32

1

and anywhere in Bell County,

2

To the contrary, the sheriff has said: "Don’t come

3

back to my county.

1 don’t want to see your faces here again»"

4

Much the same situation existed in

Princess Anne.

There, there was a temporary injunction that had been

5

6

issued.

That was the cause of the chilling effect on the

7

amendment rights.

0

Moreover, in another case referred to in

that

9

opinion was the situation of ICC orders where they were only

10

issued for a short time and then to be re-issued and in that

11

fashion that view was precluded.

12

I say to the Court there is not a thing in the world

13

to prevent the sheriff and the county attorneys from doing the

14

same thing here — charge us as they did and then when we get

15

to the proposition where we are trying to defend our case, turn

16

around and dismiss the complaint again and try to deny us any

17

kind of final determination that this statute is unconstitutional

18

and should not be enforced.

19

20
21

Q

Mr. Clinton, would you tell us whether this

committee still exists, and is it active, and -—
A

I would say to the Court that it does exist

22

and that it is active, although I must admit the record does

23

not show that anything is active.

24
25

Q

What is the meaning of that statement that it

still exists?
33

It exists as an approved, on-campus group at

A

1

2

the University of Texas.

It continues to hold meetings in the

3

university area.

4

and through advertisements it continues to state its positions

5

on things in the university area.

It continues to distribute through the mail

For whatever it is worth, I again emphasize that it

6
7

is a group that is approved, an on-campus group, at the Univer­

8

sity of Texas.

S

but I would like to spend that talking just a little bit about

10

I am not sure how much time I have remaining

Article 474 ——
Q

11

Before you get to that, may I just ask one

12

question.

Are there findings of fact that the sheriff and JP

13

said the things that you have been telling us about?

14

A

No, sir, there are not.

15

Q

Those are just in the affidavits, though.

16

A

They are in the affidavits, yes, sir.

17

Q

And there are no findings, other than those, thal

18
19

you can glean from the opinion.
A

The court below rendered the main opinion and

20

something called the addendum on a motion for new trial and

21

those are the only two papers handed down by the three-judoe

22

court, and whatever the actual findings of fact there are, are

23

in one or another of those opinions.

24
25

In that connection, it is perfectly clear that the
court below is satisfied from the evidence through affidavits,

34

1

that university committee members remain plaintiffs, some of

2

whom were not really members of the university committee but

3

rather sympathizers, supporters and associates -- that all of

4

had ceased, certainly in Bell County, any type of activity,

5

peaceful activity, designed to carry out the purposes of the

6

committee.

i

i

One or two of the plaintiffs indicated that he had

7
8

ceased all activities everywhere because he said this was a

9

State statute and he was afraid that the same thing would

to

happen in to him in any county if he engaged in similar

51

protest activities as it happened in Bell County.
He did not again want to be subjected to the

12

13

charges, to making bonds, and to court appearances and things

14

of that nature.

15

way of freedom of expresstion.

Accordingly,he had ceased all activities by

Article 474, I think, is clearly, on its face, and

16
17

in view of decisions of this Court from Cantwell vs. Connecticut

18

to Ashton vs. Kentucky — Article 474 must fall because of

19

that phrase in there vociferous language or indecent, or what­

20

ever it is, the operative phrase then going down to calculated j

2!

to disturb the inhabitants of the place where the event takes

22

place.
Certainly, in 1966 in Ashton vs. Kentucky in almost

23
24
25

identical terms calculated to create a disturbance or breach
of peace.

In here we have calculated to disturb.

35

This Court

1

said that sort of a standard leaves wide open the standard

2

of resp ns®bility and involves calculations as to the boiliner

3

point and does not in any way involve an appraisal of the

4

comments, per se.
That is the same fault that Article 474 had.

It is over-broad because it obviously includes

12

It is a combination of both over-broad and vagueness and is,

13

we think, essentially presents the same type of problem that

14

this Court resolved in Cox vs. Louisiana in which the breach

15

of the peace statute there was condemned where the Louisiana

16

court had held that it meant breach of the peace to agitate,

to disquite, to arouse from a state of repose, that those

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

21

j
I

MR. LOUISELL:

May i* please the Court.
i

22

Of course the situation in the Princess Anne County

23

just referred to by counsel was that there was an extant

24

injunction that was a precedent and that the officials were

25

relying upon it to prevent another meeting before this Court
38

I
k

1

struck down that injunction»

2

In

submitting this case, Your Honors, I have only

3

two points to make at this time:

4

burden of showing a Texas policy to use

5

speech,! don’t think I exaggerate when I say there is hardly

S

any showing of such a policy, except the conclusory statements

7

in the affidavits that their rights are chilled, because of

8

what took place.

Article 474 to stifle

Q

Can you say to what extent their rights were

A

If it was chilled to any extent, Your Honor,

chilled?

11

12 [ they must be very chillable.

Q

13
14

Would you suppose there is more of a real

controvery here than there was in the Epperson
A

15

case?

In the Epperson case, however, as the Court-

16

very carefully pointed out, it was from a State court'where the

17

trial court had granted the relief where the appellate

18

of the State wrote that two sentence opinion and, whereas, the

19

writer of the court's opinion said the case is here from a

20

State court which we think is an entirely distinguishable

21

situation.

22

court

Now, in this case, there is no suspicion, there is

23

even no possibility, of suspecting racial prejudice in the

24

case of ours, because local counsel informed me all the per­

25

sons involved were white people.
i

39

If you go to all the Texas cases in both of our

1

2

briefs, you won't find, I don't believe, Your Honors, one that

3

even concerns the contest except one involving cursing, and

there the Court said:

"It isn’t enough to show cursing

justify a conviction,,

The cursing must be shown to have been

I think it was the Chief of Police, if I remember

The State of Texas is in no way part.
