Mr. Bass.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BASS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR, BASS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may It please the Court

This is an appeal from an Order of a three-judge court In
Chicago dismissing a suit for declaratory judgment and
injunction.
The suit was filed by two pre-trial detainees in
Chicago in the Cook County Jail, on behalf of themselves and
all other persons similarly situation, who are registered
qualified voters, who are unable to get to the polls on electio^
day because they are incarcerated either without bail or
because they lack the funds to post monetary bail.
Q

In other words, these are not people who have been

convicted of crimes?
A

That is correct

Q

They are just awaiting trial?

A

That is right.

The suit sought a judgment declaring

that the Illinois statutes applicable to absentee voting are
unconstitutional in so far as they preclude the granting oi

absentee ballots to pre-trial detainees confined in the County

2

of their residence.
A timely notice of appeal was filed from the judgment

of the District Court.

a civil action which is required to be heard by a three-judge

Code which provides that a three-judge District Court is

14

required where an Injunction is sought to restrain the enforce­

15

ment, operation or execution of a state statute by restraining

16

the action of an officer of the state.

We, therefore, turn to Section 2281 of the Judicial

21

that we have a state officer, or pursuant to decisions of

22

this Court, a local officer functioning pursuant to a state

wide policy performing a state function.

24
25

This was true in

Second, that there is a state statute of general
That is what we have in this case.

Third,

Now, under Illinois laitf, as far as absentee ballots
are concerned, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners has

3

-

-

the same responsibility as the County Clerk in another County,
or anybody el3e who Is charged with the duty of furnishing
absentee ballots.
Indeed, Section 19-2 of the Election Code, which
appears on page 15 of our Brief, states on the ninth line of
the provision, that the elector make application to the County
Clerk, or where existing, to the Board of Election Commissioner!
or other officer or officers charged with the duty of furnishing ballots for such election in his voting district.
So that the fact that the Board of Election
Commissioners here are the defendants is not relevant because
their function is a state-wide function.

They perform the

same function with respect to absentee ballots as the officers
In the other Counties and localities.
Nor is this case moot at this time.

It is true that

the two named representative plaintiffs are not in the Cook
County Jail awaiting trial.

Mr. Byrd was discharged a week

after the election, at his preliminary hearing, and Mr.
McDonald went to trial.

It was a hung jury and he subsequently

pleaded to a reduced charge of manslaughter, which is a
bailable offense.
However, since this is a class action and was found
to be so by the trial court -- and I would refer to page 30
of the record where the three-judge court said ’’plaintiffs
in the class they represent."

The fact this is a class action means that the fact

2

that the named plaintiffs are not members of the class is not

fatal,

As I understand it, you say that it was a class
I am wondering what is it now?

16

A

What is it at this moment?

17

Q

Yes, sir.

13

A

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the problem is that the

19

class really cannot be seen very clearly until right before

20

an election.

21

who will be a pre-trial detainee on the day of election.

Because it is very difficult to predict exactly

22

One could not ascertain with some degree of certainty

23

perhaps a week or two before the election exactly which persons

24

which named persons would be pre-trial detainees unable to get

23

to the polls on election day, because this class is rather
5-

-

fluid.

It is really impossible to identify any names except

right before an election.
But I think the three-judge Court below recognized
that there surely must be a number of persons who are
registered qualified voters in jail on the day of election.
Incidentally, the Cook County Jail has about 1800
inmates, two-thirds of which are awaiting trial.

So there

must be some numbers of persons, although they cannot be
identified,right near and election.
Q

There is always going to be some that have just been

put in jail a day or two before who will not be able to vote
under the ordinary provisions?
A

Yes,

Q

There is a minimum time in advance within which you

have to apply for a ballot, isn't there?
A

Yes.

And we are not attacking that provision on

making application within a certain amount of time.
Q

Because that is of general applicability to all

absentee voters?
A

Yes,

Well, it is a reasonable provision.

1 don't

think that there is anything unreasonable about requiring
submissions for absentee ballots to be made in a certain time,
because there are some administrative-Q,

Really we are not here to decide what is reasonable

seems to have put the right to vote on a First Amendment basis.

And it appears to us that Williams v. Rhodes makes clear that

there is a relation between voting and political expression

which is protected by the First Amendment,

Recently this Court decided Williams v. Rhodes, which

5

interests which are compelling that justify the denial of the

right to vote to a person who is avia i ting trial.

whether there are any legitimate state

It would appear that the most the Election Board

a

could say would be that there is an administrative convenience

9

in not having to dispense too many absentee ballots.

10

But it seems to me that the mere fact that it is a

11

few more absentee ballots to give out does not justify depri­

12

vation of such a fundamental right.

13

The Board of Election Commissioners has taken the

14

position in its Brief that voting is a privilege, voting by

15

absentee ballot is a privilege rather than a right.

16

seems to me that by calling something a privilege it doesn't

17

mean that the State can arbitrarily deny it to you.

18

And it

Surely if absentee ballots were dispensed on the

19

basis of race, I don't think this Court would hesitate to

20

say that would be a denial of E^ual Protection of the Law,

21

merely because absentee balloting may be considered a privilege

22

by the State.

23

we refer to in our Reply Brief, held where the election people

24

went to the nursing homes, the white nursing homes and not the

25

black nursing homes, that was a denial of Equal Protection of

We submit that the mere fact that it is an absentee

distinction.

S

Now* the Board of Election Commissioners raises the

6

question* need prisoners be afforded privileges when they can

7

be denied liberty?
I think this is perhaps the first case that this

Q

Court has had an opportunity to determine whether there are

10

any conditions or consequences of pre-trial detention which

tf

may be considered constitutionally impermissible.

12

recognise that no matter how much reform occurs there is going

13

to be a number of people that are going to be incarcerated

14

prior to trial.
It seems to me we must address ours to the consequent-

of the pre-trial detention.

17

I don’t think that as a basic proposition one could

18

say the mere fact a man Is detained prior to trial you can do

19

anything you want to him.
I think he is entitled to certain minimum standards

20
21

of decency.

I think that if the State attempts to deny certain

22

rights they must show compelling interests.
Now, what kind of compelling interests might be

23
24

shown?

Perhaps institutions have certain rules regarding

25

persons who visit.

Considerations of institutional security,

9

”

-

.

i

1

of course, are paramount.

2

Washington indicated that its decision in no way suggested that

3

the Warden couldn’t make allowances for institutional security.

4

And I think this Court in Lee v.

But no where in the record of this case or any case

5

have I ever heard that inmate voting by absentee ballot is

6

going to disrupt the routine of an institution.

7

nothing to suggest that it does.

I think common sense would suggest that perhaps
morale would get a lift when somebody votes from behind bars.

Most of the States have therein provisions for
physical disability to absence from various localities.

20

For example, twelve states say if you will be absent

21

from the precinct you can get an absentee ballot.

22

say if you are absent from the City you can get an absentee

23

ballot.

One state, Louisiana, says if you are absent from the

24

parish.

Twenty-three states say if you are absent from the

25

County.

And five states say if you are absent from the State

Q

Don't some of the state limit the elgibility for

A

Some of them break it down and say absence from the

County for business reasons.

Q

Some of them do.

Q

So it would require the absence to be on account of

on election day you can get an absentee ballot.

business.

But not for vacation?

And others limit it to at least military or students?

11

A

That is correct.

12

Q

And others to physical incapacity to be there?

1.3

A

That is correct.

14

Q

Aren't there all sorts of qualifications made by

each one of the States, or at least by the typical States?

19
20

There is no state, is there, that just says if you

.

are not going to be here for any reason?
A

I think Maine says that.

I think that is the only

State that does that.
We are not suggesting that everybody who wants an

21

absentee ballot can have one.

22

which we recognize as constitutional.

23

mother has children or the breadwinner who has a job with

24

long hours and can't get to the polls and finds it inconvenient,

25

we are not submitting that is a denial of the constitution.

There are certain limitations

1

vie

2

have the State patting the man in the disability.

We have the

O

state Judge putting the man in jail on election day, and we

4

have another state agency which refuses the ballot.

5

that is joint state action which effectively deprives a man

6

of the right to vote.

And togethe €

So it seems to me that the situation of the prisoners

7

8

can be distinguished and any decision in their favor would not

9

necessarily have to -require that everybody in the world get an

10
11

12
13

absentee ballot.
Q

Do you have that state by state analysis to which

you just referred in your brief?
A

We did not include it in the Brief, your Honor.

1

14

would be glad to submit that by way of supplemental Brief, if

15

I may have leave to do so.

16

Q

Yes; it would be helpful if you would do that.

17

A

I will.

In terms of legitimate state interests,

18

perhaps it might be urged that the take over theory, that all

19

of the inmates voting together might outweigh a community.

20

But, in the first place, the inmates would vote in the County,

21

in the precincts in which they lived prior to becoming a member

22

of the jail population.

23

where the jail was located, but they would be interspersed in

24

the precincts from which they come.

25

theory was rejected by this Court in the Carrington case.

So they would not vote in the precinct

12-

-

And I think the take over

We would submit that this case can be decided on a

1

z

number of theories.

3

the absentee ballot to a person who is jailed in another

4

County but denial of an absentee ballot to a person jailed

5

in the County of his residence is absolutely irrational.

6

Q

One theory would be that the granting of

If that is the proposition which you are advancing

7

here, it would lead us to invalidate an awful lot of these

8

state laws to which you have referred, that is to say, you

9

make the distinction that here the person is being kept away

10

»

from the polls by a state action,
A

That is correct.

That is my second theory, that

12

that case goes off on the fact that the state granted him

13

inability to get to the polls.

14
15
16

Q

Well, I suppose then you have to talk about what is

primary cause.
A

What is your first reason?

Well, the first one is that the classifications

17

that the State of Illinois has employed are not rational or

18

based upon compelling state interests.

19

Board of Election Commissioners for the State has failed to

20

show in what respect there is a legitimate state interest that

21

requires the denial of absentee ballots.

22

Q

That is, that the

That is one that would lead, at least,by the treacher

23

ous path of strict logic, to the conclusion that we have to

24

examine every one of these state laws and say that it is not

25

rational or reasonable for a State to say that you can get an
13-

-

3

absentee ballot if you are out of town on business, but not

2

if you are out of the state for some other reason?

3

A

Well, I would say yes, except using the compelling

4

state interest theory, that the State would probably be able

5

to show in a large number of those situations involving mere

6

inconvenience rather than impossibility, that there is a

7

compelling state interest.

8

they can show that,

9

Q

Whereas in this case 1 don't think

physically incapacitated for medical reasons?

If he is in

the County he can vote absentee, can he?
A

Physically incapacitated, I believe about perhaps

half of the States.

13

Q

I am talking about Chicago, about Illinois?

16

A

Well, if the man is physically incapacitated and you

17

can produce the certificate of a physician, which the Illinois

18

statute requires, and if he is Inside the County he can get an

19

absentee ballot.

22

who are in the County on election day?

physically incapacitated, that is, medically incapacitated,

24

or those who are observing a religious holiday, who may get

25

absentee ballots; is that correct?
-

14-

It is those who are

That is the way I read that.

A

1

1

There was one classification added by the Legis­

2

lature at the last minute which escaped the attorneys and the

who is working on election day in a precinct other than his

And even if a man is in jail#

So it seems to me that it is difficult to say that
this refusal to give absentee ballots to these class of
15-

-

persons is justified by considerations of institutional
security.

Because if that were true, the Legislature would

have said, I hope, that we make a finding that because of the
routine of the jail it would be so disruptive that no absentee
ballot should go to prisoners.
Q,

You don’t have a case in which the State has

explicitly said we are going to deny the right of an absentee
ballot to people who are in jail?
Rather than that, you have a case in which the State
has said we aren’t going to grant the right of absentee ballots

on election day, to the following two groups, and to

these three groups and to these three groups only:

are celebrating a religious holiday, and those who because
they are judges or poll watchers are going to be in another
voting place?
A

And those who will be out of town.

And those are the only three groups to whom we are

going to grant the right of absentee voting, even though they
are in the County on election day.

Wouldn’t that be a reasonable interpretation of this

It doesn’t say that a medically incapacitated man

who is in prison will not be granted the right to vote?

12

A

No.

13

Q,

I would think that your prisoner# if he is medically

under that statute and would have an absentee ballot.

He might be able to.

I think if he had a physician’s certificate# under

20

those circumstances the Election Commissioners would give him

a ballot.

So it doesn’t bar all prisoners?

23

A

It just bars those that are well, not religiously

Commissioners and I was unable to find any.

in the area of absentee bal3.ots-Q

lie need that.

A

I think that is is an important one because absentee

ballots have been with us since the Civil War and they have
become a very convenient means of voting.

It is not like in

the old days where it was considered such a new process that
the State Courts were striking them clown.
Q

'What do the Illinois election officials say if

somebody shows up at the polling place, not with a certificate
of a physician, but with a certificate of the Warden, which
these people did?

What do the election officials say, not

about the polling place, but as to the absentee ballot?

They said in this case "you don't have the right

certificate."

didn't give them out absentee ballots?
A

As I understand the Illinois lav/, it is true that the

provisions of absentee ballots are permissive, but it seems to

I would say to the extent to which the State can

:

12

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. KUSPER:

:

Counsel for the Petitioners has

13

consistently stated this case in the negative both at the trial

14

below and before this Court.

15

that the State must show a compelling state Interest in

16

depriving this small group of persons of a supposed constitutio: ial

17

right to an absentee ballot.

18

another way for the Court.

19

His constant statement has been

I would care to phrase it in

The State has extended to large ascertainable groups

20

of people the privilege of absentee balloting.

21

of the ballot, the right of the ballot, has been constitutional i-y

22

guaranteed, but the privilege of casting it under conditions

23

imposed by the State which are reasonable by absentee ballot,

24

I think, is a privilege.

The privilege

Is it necessary for one to be on your side to try

to put It on the basis of a privilege or a right?

Some 15*000 applications

right with privilege.
Q

Does the State in order to take care of one evil

have to take care of every possible evil anyone can conceive?
A

No, I think a state legislature in attacking a

14

problem of evil may take the entire evil at one time, it may

15

take it step by step, it may progress from one phase of the

16

problem to another phase of the problem and make corrections

Q

Don’t you think the State should have a reason?

A

I think the State has a reason for enacting a piece

of legislation»
Q

Do you think the State is obliged to tell somebody

the reason why you distinguish between a prisoner awaiting
trial outside the County and those inside the County?
A

Prisoners awaiting trial outside of the County3 Mr»

Justice Marshall;, are outside of the County and fall into that
class of persons granted the absentee ballot privilege because
they are out of the County.
Q

They are different because they are outside of the

County?
A

That is right.

Q

But they are still awaiting trial by the State of

Illinois?
A

That is correct»

Q

So that much they are alike.

Why draw the line?

A

Because the State has taken affirmative action in

granting the absentee ballot to groups of people.
by inadvertence or otherwise, I don’t know.
reason, I don’t know.

If it has

If they had a

It may be they never even thought of

the problem.
Q

Can you think of a reason?

A

Why they should not be granted an absentee ballot?

Q

No,

Why the State made a difference between a man

„24

I

in jail waiting for trial outside the County and a man waiting

2

for trial inside the County.
When I finish that I want to know the difference

3
4

between a man out on bail and a man who is incarcerated but

5

not having the money for bail.

6

It is my firm belief that the legislature in

7

enacting the absentee ballot legislation never considered the

3

persons present inside the County and the persons outside the

9

county.

to

Q

You mean they didn’t know that?

„

A

I don’t know whether or not they knew that.

There

12

are 177 members of the Illinois House and 59 members of the

13

I would not presume to know what they thought

Now, what reason is there for that distinction?
A

I don’t know of any reason at all, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
Q

Aren't you obliged to give us something close to a

reason?
A

No.

I believe that my burden, sir, under the
25**

-

1

language of the cases of this Court is to demonstrate that

2

Mr. Bass, on behalf of the Petitioners, has not carried his

3

burden, not whether there was an arbitrary and capricious

4

action on the part of the Legislature in enacting this par™

5

ticular legislation.
Second, if the burden does shift to me, does shift

6
7

to me to nationalize or justify the decision, then it is my

3

burden to go forward with it.

9

and I cannot give a reason why legislation beginning back in

And you asked me for reasons

10

1917j> prior to the time of my birth, sir, why that legislation

n

did not contain some provision for these persons.
It is my sincere belief, as I stated before, that

12
13

the legislature has never considered the problem — either

14

it wasn't cognizant of it or that no one has considered it

15

and taken the time to bring it up.

18

Q

The legislature did consider the problem as to

17

whether or not people in jail awaiting trial should or should

18

not have an absentee ballot?

19

A

No, sir.

20

Q

The legislature did consider that?

21

A

No, sir.

There is nothing in the record that would

22

indicate that, and there is nothing in the history of the

23

legislation that would indicate it,

24
25

The physical incapacity that is discussed and covered
in the statute relates itself solely to the question of
„26™

i

physical incapacity because of physical illness* properly

z

attested to by the affidavit of a physician or CMstian

3

Science practitioner and there is nothing in the statute

4

or anything in the legislative history that would indicate

5

that the legislature ever considered this and deliberately

6

drexu a distinction between the two classes of persons.

7

they considered was who is in the County and who is out.

3

Q

9

A

Mr, Ba3S has apparently drawn the distinction.

10

Q

No.

Who did draw the distinction?

They tried to file their absentee ballots and

ii

the Election Commissioners said they were not physically

12

handicapped; isn’t that what happened?

13

A

All

I was present at all times when these petitione

14

for absentee ballots were presented.

15

by the legislature* they are bound by the state requirements

16

in the State of Illinois and they have to grant absentee

17

ballots in those specified cases enumerated in the statute

18

allowing the presentation of absentee voting.

19

Being a statute created

When Mr, Bass came to our office with the applications

20

and the affidavit of the Assistant Warden in each case* he did

21

not comply with any of the permissible applications that were

22

provided for in the statute and* therefore* the Board of

23

Election Commissioners—

24

Q

What is there in the statute that this did not

25

comply with?

Didn’t they say that it was physically impossible
27-

-

for them to get there?
A

They said., sir, that it was physically impossible

for them to be in attendance at the polls and they attached
the affidavit of the Assistant Warden saying they couldn't
leave the premises.

But they did not attach the affidavit of

a doctor or Christian Science practitioner, which was required
under the statute of Illinois and, therefore, the Board of
Election Commissioners, being purely ministerial at this
point, could not accept that application or that affidavit
and could not within the meaning of the statute grant an
absentee ballot,

Tc do so would have been a violation of the

Illinois law.
Q

There is no question that this was state action?

A

I don’t think so,

Q

The action of the Commissioners?

A

The Commissioners acted pursuant to Illinois statute.

There is no question about the fact that they acted under the
Illinois law in their capacity as officers created by a statute
in Illinois.
Q

Were you advising them?

A

Yes, sir, I was, sir.

And did you help him draw his affidavit?

Was I advising whom?

The Election Commissioners.

For the Election Commissioners?

No, I did not.

6

Q

Page 26 has your name at the end of it.

3

not,

You say

that I refused to authorize the issuance of absentee ballots
3

to the named plaintiffs, rather than violate my statutory

duty, and you say that you will grant future applications only

10

if forced to do so by compulsory process.

11

did it you would be subject to fine and imprisonment?

12

14

A

That is correct.

And you say if you

Board of Election Commissioners,.
Q

So there is a law in Illinois that if the Election

13

Commissioners had issued these ballots they would have been

put in jail?

A

There is a general provision, Mr. Justice White.

You say there is no state action that precludes

There is a state statute that precludes it.

they acted in denial of the petition for absentee ballot

affidavit saying I am going to be in the County on election

of my sister's sick child and can't get to the polls* then

21

the Election Board could not under the law have granted that

person an absentee ballot* and if they had done so they

would have been subject to criminal penalties* simply because

there is no provision for that kind of person voting absentee?

is whether the additional consequences, namely, that he doesn’t

ability of bail or anything else, any other privileges, the

only one single privilege about which we have a complaint here

is the unavailability of the absentee ballot —

No, the right to vote.

Yes, I think that point can be quite seriously made.

And the man who does not have money cannot vote?

Apparently that is true under the statute that we

I think it is a valid distinction when the interests

18

of society are considered as a whole rather than just looking

19

at it in isolation.

20

Q

I have been unable at this point of these questions

21

to find any interest other than one man has money and the other-

22

one does not,

23

A

I wish that I could simplify it to that point.

24

Q

What else is there?

25

A

I think there is, first of all, what interest did the

the right to vote.

Because the man with money can vote.

He

S

A

Not necessarily that.

6

Q

But the man that doesn’t have the money can't vote.

7

A

A man without money quite possibly under a special

8

habeas corpus can be taken from the jail,, if necessary, to

3

his polling place and therefore be allowed to vote in the

10
11

12
13

polling place.
Q

Who is going to put up the money for the habeas

corpus?
A

I have no idea.

They can let a pauper’s petition

14

be filed and quite possibly the court might take jurisdiction

15

over something—

18

A

Leaving that aside, what do you have other than

In this case?

Absolutely nothing.

The only

19

distinction apparently about a person being able to get out

20

of jail to go vote, if that becomes a paramount interest, is

21

the fact he has some money to get out.

But I would like to raise the question about the

an absentee ballot.

14

She had to get one town

I -would venture to say in almost every Instance,

15

having studied election laws of the various states, being a

16

member of the Illinois Law Commission, I can see if this

17

court were to decide the Illinois statute was unconstitutional,

18

that the great bulk of the statutes concerning absentee

19

balloting would then immediately be suspect and subject to

20

challenge on the same ground, because there are some provisions

21

which I think are even more unfair in other states than they

22

are in Illinois, if this be unfair at all.

23

Assuming arguendo it could be unfair, I think we

24

have an unintentional omission of the legislature, no malice,

25

not purposeful at all, no discrimination, just a classification

38-

-

1

made by the legislature in a valid attempt to extend the

2

privilege of absentee balloting to large ascertainable groups

3

of persons* that has just simply missed in its application

4

one small and I might even add miniscule group of persons --

5

two persons is all we have had--

6

Q

Isn't that a class action?

7

A

It is a class action,

3

Q

Why do you keep saying two people?

9

A

I say two people because I think 1 have been very

10

close to the case and I know how these cases came about; and

n

after the Norman Bond case the morale in the County Jail in

12

Cook County was so much uplifted because of this decitsion

13

that we quite possibly could have assumed there would have

14

been an outpouring of applications for absentee balloting

15

and we only got McDonald and--

16

Q

Doesn’t the record in this case show this case is

17

a class action case and the State has never contested it*

13

you recognised it as a class action case?

Am I correct?

19

A

Yes,

20

Q

And so in thet class are all of the prisoners in the

21

State of Illinois awaiting trial.

That is the class,

22

A

Who are registered voters,

23

Q

Right.

24

A

And qualified to vote at the time of an election.

25

Q

Right,

39

“

-

1

A

And there may not be any such persons at all.

There

2

is no way to determine the existence of that on a state wide

3

basis.

4

Q

5
Q

I, for one, if there were two, I would assume there

might be half of one more.
A

I might assume that too.

But

what X amsaying is

7

there is no demonstrable way I can

S

class exists at this moment or at any other moment because

9

you couldn’t do a survey to determine that.

10
11

Q,

show to the Court that that

The place to contest that is at the trial court.

You admitted it was a class action.

12

A

At the time it was filed.

13

Q

And you admit now it was a class action?

14

A

As it was brought then, yes.

15

Q

I thought the class was even narrower than that.

18

I thought it was of those pre-trial detainees detained in a

17

prison in the County where they were registered?

13

A

I would assume that, yes.

19

Q

I thought that is what we were told.

20

A

Yes.

21

Q

So this doesn’t reach, for example, detainees in

22
23
24
25

some prison out of the County of their residence?
A

No.

Because they fall into the general class of

persons who are outside of the county and, therefore, they are
entitled to an absentee ballot under that provision of our
-

40-

1
2

3
4

statute
Q

Did you ever get any application from such prisons

outside of the County?
A

Not to my knowledge.

And I have been with the Board

5

for seven years.

6

I would have because I am in constant communication with the

7

other election officials in the State.

8
9
10

Q

I have heard of none in the State and I think

Do you think that it is common in a very large

percentage of the people who are in jail itfltout bond* that they
are registered voters?

11

A

I would have no way of knowing that.

12

Q

VJould you say it is likely to be one hundred percent?

13

A

If the Justice is asking for a guess from me., I

54

don't think the percentage is going to be very high.

13

we might have seen more of it in this case than just the two

16

plaintiffs that we have here.

17
18
19

Q,

Because

I thought you were telling me this man was registered

and qualified to vote?
A

He xtfas otherwise qualified to vote,

He was duly

20

registered and a person qualified to vote had he appeared at

21

his polling place on election day.

22

McDonald.

Both of them, Byrd and

23

Q

Is the voting age twenty-one?

24

A

Yes, sir.

25

Q

So I suspect to the extent some of these detainees

41

-

-

1

2

are under twenty-one?
A

I think the class gets down to a point where it

3 i
£
4

becomes very* very small class*

5

of them are going to be registered voters.

Because not all persons who

are in the County Jail are going to be twenty-one and not all

s

Q

Or residents of the County?

7

A

That is right»

You can be committed in our County

3

Jail for accusation of a crime without being a resident of the

9

County*

10

Q

Does the record show what they are in jail for?

11

A1

One was in on an original charge of murder* and I

12

forget what the other one was in on*

13

discloses that in one of the Briefs.

14

Q

Was the other one robbery?

15

A

Right.

I think the record

One was released on preliminary hearing and

IS

one was tried and got a hung jury and he eventually was retried

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

22

Mr. Bass* you have a

moment or so.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BASS* ESQ.
MR, BASS:

First* as to the question about the writ

I;
of habeas corpus.

23

I discussed with the Chief Judge of the Criminal

24

Division whether a person can be taken over and he laughed

25

at the idea and didn't think it was feasible to have writs
-

42-

!

1

and have deputy sheriffs accompany them to the polls.
With reference to the legitimate state interest to

2
3

prevent fraud, I would say if there were a state provision

4

that said no absentee ballots for anybody in jail, that would

5

be one thing.

6

persons in jail in another county and the liklihood of fraud

7

is just as great.

a
9

Q

But presumably these ballots can be given to

No, this is because they are not voting for a

Sheriff over in that other County.

The Sheriff of Cook County

10

is their custodian and he is the man who is the candidate,

11

so there isn’t the same interest.

12
13

A

We are talking about a person who lives in Chicago

who is caught In Wheaton.

14

Q

He is not in the custody of the Cook County Sheriff?

13

A

That is true.

But I would indicate the absentee

16

ballot procedure has to cast the ballot in the presence of

17

a notary outside of the site so there is a check against

18

fraud.

19

Q

If these people were so greatly interested in voting,

20

did the thought occur to you to make a motion before the Judge

21

who has charge of the custody of those things and you could

22

have been granted a motion to let them vote?
Did that thought occur to you?

23
24
25

A

It occurred to me.

And when I took that up with

the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division he indicated—

-

Q

He indicated.

But did you try?

Did you file a

proceeding?
A

No.

Q

You just attacked the constitutionality of the whole

A

We took the realistic position that the only way a

law?

person in jail could vote is by mail, that it would be an
imposition on the state to require armed deputy sheriffs to
take somebody to the polls.
Q
to them?

Why would it be an imposition, if it is that important
Maybe the armed deputy sheriff would have been glad

to do it.
But you have to go in and attack the constitutionality
of the law.

Everybody has to attack the constitutionality of

the law.
A

Well, we would submit that in terms of consequences

of pre-trial detention that this is an impermissible one and
absentee balloting is the one way we can talk about a person
in jail voting.
Q

Prisoners are taken as witnesses to trials all the

Well, I would say iiils „

time.
That I made a value judgment

and I am responsible for that, that after discussing this thing
iirith the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division I felt that his
position was reasonable and that the only way to talk meaningful

if
about voting was voting by mail rather than in person, and/the
right to vote by absentee ballot cannot be obtained from this
court 1 suppose we will have to try to exhaust the other
possibility.
Q
A

That is the Illinois Legislature?
No, that is filing a petition for a writ of habeas

corpus ad votandum to see if we

can show the State is foreclos­

ing all avenues of-Q

Did it occur to you that this might be a matter for

the Legislature?
Do you think you could find enough prisoners who
are that much interested in voting?
A

One of the activities of our legal aid project is

to try to get people interested in citizenship.

At the present

time they seem to be more interested in taking their grievances
to the street than through the ballot box.
(Whereupon, the above-entitled oral argument was
concluded.)
