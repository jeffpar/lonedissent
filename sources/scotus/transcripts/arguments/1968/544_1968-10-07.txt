THE CLERKs

MR. SPEIDERs

Mr. Chief Justice,

I would like to

Mr. Gordon, you may proceed.

ORAL .ARGUMENT OF JERRY GORDON, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

13

MR. GORDON s

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the

14

Court, this is the companion action to the case below. The

15

appellants were plaintiffs in the District Court of the

1G

Southern District of Ohio, and they are the Socialist Labor

17

Party of America and its Ohio members.

18

They brought suit to «challenge the Ohio electoral

19

system which completely excluded them from participating on

20

an equal basis with the other political parties in Ohio, or

21

even on an unequal basis; their rights as a political party

22

were in effect obliterated by a series of Ohio election laws.

23
24
25

They challenged those laws, and a declaratory
I*.

judgment favoring to their position was rendered, and write-in
provision was provided for the 1968 election and ballot
3

1

position was denied.

2
3

From that branch of the opinion denying ballot
position we appeal *

4

The Socialist Labor Party of America is a national

5

political party, with roots reaching back into the 19th

6

Century.

7

American society0 and it advocates that this be brought about

8

through the ballot.

9
10

It advocates the socialist reconstruction of

It has never used any other rssans but peaceful,
constitutional means to advance its position.

11

Accordingly, it places great emphasis on elections.

12

It is currently in its twentieth consecutive presidential

13

campaign.

14

and conducted a write-in campaign in nine others.

15

it has bssn on

IS

Century.

17

In 1964, it was on the ballot in sixteen states,

Ohio going

Similarly,

into the 19th

Hew the party in Ohio has modest numbers.

Pursuant

18

to the request of the District Court, documents were sub­

19

mitted which showed that the partySs members equalled some

20

approximately 108.

21

These documents also show thatthe party distributed

22

in a single year, and this is customary, approximately a

23

quarter of a million pieces of literature, or leaflets.

24

It is a small party, but an energetic one.

25

Q

Excuse me.

I gather that you have a practical

4

1

problem here, that your client is not the benaficairy of

2

the interim relief of the appellants in the previous case,

3

and what is the situation if you were to prevail?

4

any opportunity?

S

there isn't any opportunity to get you on the ballot,

6

7
8

A

Is there

I understand the previous argument is that

We take issue with that position.

We did apply

for equivalent relief,
Q

1 said the practical side is that you are not on

3

these ballots which we are advised have now bean prepared,

10

and they have the American Independent Party name on them.

11

You are not named on any ballot at the present time.?

12

k

No, sir.

13

Q

And there is a practical problem of how, before

That is correct,

14

election, there can be printed, if you prevail, ana dis­

15

tributed ballots

16

that problem?

17

A

with

the name of

your party?

Don't

we

have

We have that problem, but it is our position that

18

there is more than ample opportunity to print ballots or,

19

if necessary, to re-“print ballots, which in our judgment

20

will conform to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.

21

Q

As a practical matter, what support do you have

22

for the statement that there is ample time for the printing

23

of ballots which will enable the Socialist Labor Party to

24

appear?

23

A

For one thing, and counsel on both sides have to

- 5 i

1

rely on representations to the Court, and that is what we

2

did, and we have been in touch with ten counties.

3

of these counties the ballots have been printed, completely

4

printed, and in other counties ballots are in process of

5

being printed.

6

In four

In Cuyahoga and Mahoning County, ballots are going

7

to be printed, next week,

if it is possible in a county

8

the sise of Cuyahoga County, the most densely populated

9

county in Ohio, to still print ballots, we submit it is possi­

10

ble in every other county.

11

before the election.

12

still possible to print ballots in time for that election.

We are after all some 29 days

We have many, many printers, and it is

MacDougaXX v. Green there were only twelve days.

13
14

Q

But can you print end program machines in 29 days?

15

A

We would concade that there will be a great problem

16
17
13

as far as programming machines.
Q

What per cent of the voters in the great State of

Ohio are going to vote on the machines?

19

A

If vgiriss widely, and if Franklin County —

20

Q

But over the whole State?

21

A

We have 88 different systems, and we don't have

22
23
24
25

those statistics.
O

What par cent of all of the voters of Ohio are

going to vote through machines?
A

I am unable to say.

6

1

Q

Would it be 75 per cent?

2

A

In Cuyahoga County it is much less, arid in Franklin

3

County it is all.

4

that we seek, that counties that had planned to conduct

5

their elections via voting machines may have to use paper

6

ballots.

It may mean that if we secured the order

This may be the case.
But, at any rate, it is certainly possible at this

7
3

juncture to print paper ballots for the entire state, and

9

for Cuyahoga County their voting machines have already

10

been programmed to provide for the Socialist Labor Party

1?

candidates in the event this Court does order those candi­

12

dates to be placed on the ballot,

13

Q

When were the candidatas selected?

14

A

The candidates were selected fcy the Socialist

15

Labor Party at its convention in May of this year,
Q

16
17

So you couldn’t have complied with the February

rule, could you?
h

13

Wo, Your Honor, although 1 don’t think that that

19

rule by itself precludes us getting on the ballot because

20

the other parties didn’t nominate their candidates until

21

August.

22

23
24
25

Q

Who was your candidate four years ago?

A

Who was the candidate for President four years

Q

Yes,

ago?
While you are answering that, the next

1

question iss

2

A

Why didn’t you take that action then?

This time they are Blaumsn and Taylor.

3

The reason the party did not bring its suit earlier,

4

in the documents, this is covered in the documents' before

5

the Court, and the party was anxious to test the constitu­

6

tionality of the law some years past, but it didn't have

7

the resources.

3
9
10

In 1946 it qualified for ballot in Ohio, and

had

about 30,090 signatures, to qualify its candidate for
governor.

11

It filed 45,000.

What happened?

The Board of Elections said not enough signatures

12

had been filed.

13

the Ohio Suprema Court, and finally got an order and put

14

their candidate on the ballot but that exhausted the party's

15

resources.

The party had to file a mandamus action in

It is a small party, and it is not an affluent

16
17

party.

18

to pursue this matter and was unable to finance it, and in

19

this case it has been brought by the Civil Liberties Union,

20

and that is the only way it has been able to bring its action.
The party shows a membership of 108 in Ohio.

21
22

23
24

25

For over a period of years it attempted to get counsel

Q

Aren't there many states that require more than —

there are some states that have more counties than 108.
A

I suppose there are, but there are many states

where a party of 108 has no difficulty whatever in getting

on the ballot.

In the State of Washington one hundred people

can corae together -Q

is it your position that under the Constitution,

4

in as large a state, a party with only 108 members is going

5

to bring that state to the expense of printing a ballot in

6

every county of the state?

7

A

That is correct,

h small political party has an

a

absolute Constitutional right to be on the ballot unless

3

a state ca». prove and can show a compelling necessity which

10

would justify legislation which has the effect of excluding

11

that party from the ballot.
The rights of the members of the small party to

12
13

be on the ballot are just as important to them, and perhaps

14

more so, than the rights of the members of a large political

15

party.

13

0

On© is just as important as the other.
I understand that your position is exactly the

17

opposite of the state.

18

right to bar for any reason at all a political party.

19

take the position that the party has the absolute right to

20

be put on the ballot even though it has only 108 members?

21

22

A

That is, that they have an absolute

We added a branch to that.

If a state can prove

a compelling justification --

23

Q

You can’t think of one of those, can you?

24

A

It is hard for me, Your Honor, because we have

25

examined the reasons that have historically bean offered.
-

9

-

Q

1

So you really are, as Justice Black suggests,

2

you corae pretty close to claiming an absolute right to be on

3

the ballot?

4

A

That is essentially right.

We find no justification

5

for keeping a small party off.

If you are going to ask me

6

can one person insist upon the right to be on it, no, msybe

7

not.

We don't feel that we have any until it is proven

13

that a problem is created.

10

again, on all of the controversies before referring to

17
18

This Court has said time and time

voting rights, the Court has said that it will meticulously
scrutinise any impairment.
Now, I submit if you have a small political party

19

20

and it is not on the ballot, if it is not able to meet

21

qualifications, its rights have been impaired.

22

obvious.

23
24
23

Q

That is

Mr,, Gordon, we are all throwing around the word

"rights."
I understand Ohio's argument in the previous case
10

1

was that the source of right it asserts* correctly or in­

2

correctly * it cites Article II* Section 1* of the United

3

States Constitution,
What source are you talking about for these rights?

4
5

.And 1 presume that you are talking about some Constitutional

S

right?

7

A

We base our rights on a number of the sections of

a

the Constitution* but primarily on the equal protection clause

9

of the Fourteenth Amendment,

We would like to develop that,

' Judge Rlnneary in District Court said that if the

10

11

Wallace Party is not placed upon the ballot* it will not

12

have equal opportunity* end that is the electors* the people

13

of Ohio will be treated as secondclass electors* and that

14

is not right.

And the party should therefore be placed on

j.

15

the

ballot.

In the same breath he said that the Socialist

16
17

Labor Party* because it is small* does not have a similar

18

right,

19

Wow* we submit that this type of philosophy is

20

alien to basic Constitutional tenets and guarantees* and

21

I want to illustrate an, example.

22

In any other area* involving fundamental rights*

23

this type of doctrine doesn't apply.

24

in a Southwest community in the Southwest part of this

25

For example* assume

country a restaurant which has a policy of segregation* and
11

1

assume that the restaurant owner will not permit Mexican

2

Americans or Negroes to eat in that restaurant , ana a class

3

suit is brought by representatives of both groups.

4

Now-, what would this Court think if a Court said.*

3

"Well* yes* the policy denies the members of those groups

6

equal opportunity, and it treats them as secondclass citizens,

7

and it will not be permitted* but it will not be permitted

3

for the Mexican Americans, because in this community they

9

are a substantial section of the population, but on the other

10

hand a policy will be permitted for Negro Americans because

11

they are a small minority."
That is exactly what we have here.

12

Q

13

Is that exactly what you have?

You have a Constitu­

14

tional provision

15

Here you are going under the general protection and equal

1G

protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
A

17

against discriminating on account of race.

I am only using Judge Kinneary’d language.

13

In his opinion, he said to deny Wallace a position on the

19

ballot would be treating the citizens like secondclass

20

electors and denying them equal opportunity.

21

that.

22

We agree with

We think both parties should be on the ballot.

Vie

23

think there is an impairment of the right of the small

24

political party when it is kept off the ballot, end it aoesn't

25

have its name on the ballot, and we ask this question;
.12

1

Why shouldn't it be on the ballot?

z

should it, but why shouldn’t it be co-equal with the ofcaer

3

political parties*

4
5

7

The question is not

It is done in Colorado* and it is done in Maw YOrk.
Q

Where did the political party get the "right",

underscored, to be on the ballot?
A

It derives its right from the equal protection

8

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

9

that is being established of a-percentage, which is too high.

Here is a classification

10

The percentage is set not by the State of Ohio, and not by

n

the Ohio Legislature.

12

Q

You say it is one-half of one per cent, and the

13

State says it is 15 per cent, and do you have a happy medium

14

for us?

15
1G
17
18

A

Yes, the proposal we have is one-tenth of one per­

cent with a maximum of 10,000.
Q

The State says 15 per cent, and you say that.

Would you give us a happy medium?

19

A

Wo.

20

Q

Because you wouldn’t qualify, is that right?

21

A

That is correct.

22

Q

tod that is the reason you want this one figure,

23
24
25

that just fits like a glove?
A

No, Your Honor, we are suggesting that as a ceiling

Would the State be right in limiting a ballot to

one hundred people?

Do you think that was good?

I would say this. Your Honor,

Would that be good?

A

That would not be good.

1 would be opposed to

Do you think -that that State could have a ballot

with ©ne thousand people running for President?

12

A

Would the

Yes, it might, if that happened, but then it would

13

come to this Court and say they have a legitimate problem,

14

and the ballot is just too large, and we have a bed-sheet

IS

for a court.

Nobody has ever shown that.

In the Congressional race, in the 23rd District of

17

Ohio, wa had fourteen candidates, and

correct this?
A

No, we havenot,Your Honor.

Q

Why not?

A

Because we have more faith 'in Federal courts than

in State courts to relieve the type of problem that this
party has faced, the obliteration of its rights.
Q

Since .1948 to date, you have never asked the State.

8

You say the State is wrong and you have never asked the

9

State to correct its own error?

10

A

The State Legislature, or the State court?

It

Q

The State.

12

A

The State Legislature is run by two political

13

parties, and to them the words "third party" are anathema.

14

They want to perpetuate the type of political power that

15

they have enjoyed over the years.

16

Q

That is not true for the courts, I am sure.

17

A

The courts are much more detached, but the Federal

18

courts we have much greater faith in their willingness to

19

be guardians of the Constitutional rights of third political

20

parties.

Q

There is a spirit which pervades.
Is that the reason you didn't go into the State

courts?

Yes, we thought there would be better opportunity

for getting relief in Federal courts.

22

extreme position, end suppose wa talc© the position that the

23

lower court was right in saying that the Ohio law is un­

24

constitutional, although Ohio could make reasonable regulations

Q

Mow, would ifc or would it not suffice for your

purposes?

4

A

5

It would suffice for our purposes for the 1968

6

elections, because we would then argue as follows2

That

7

in the absence of any restrictions, constitutionally viable

8

restrictions imposed by the State, the Court has no right to

©

set up its own aid to keep a political party off,and therefore

10

the District Court should have placed the party on the

11

ballot»

Q

12

So we would meet that proposition»
That is what I am trying to get to»

In other words,

13

your position would be that since by ray assumption the

!4

statute is unconstitutional, this Court should not then cay

13

that on@ hundred members of a political party is not enough,

16

but we should then say that all parties before us are en™

17

titled to relief, is that correct?
A

m

That is correct, Your Honor.
Mow, that would be one branch of the argument.

19

But the second branch is this:

20

In the absence of guidelines,

we all know what the tests are now.

21

The teats are any statute

that is going to regulate the accessibility of the ballot

17

A

That is correct, Your Honor, and we have stated in

our final brief filed with the Court, that the absentee

ballots may have arrived at a point of no return.

20

this Court should decide to put the Socialist Labor Party

that if the legislature fails to act, then we ask the Court

15

to give us ballot relief.

if X may clarify, Your Honor, the prayer requested

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF .JERKY GORDON, ESQ,

2

MR, GORDONS

May it please the Court, I would like

•3

to first again emphasise that the Socialist Labor Party,

4

small though it was, and is, was on the ballot many, many

5

times in the course ©f Ohio's history.

6

Documents have been submitted to the Court,

7

What we actually ask is that the party5s rights be restored

G

that were taken from it, and we would like to emphasise that

9

in many other areas of voting rights, due primarily to the

W

contributions of this Court, there has been great advance

11

and progress.

12
13

Rights have been given t© Negroes to vote and to
women to vote, and you have had the reapportionment case.

14

Q

I believe the Court is aware of all of that.

15

A

Because there were many other cases,such as

16

Louisiana v. The United States, where the right was circum»

17

scribed in the maimer in which it was implemented, and the

18

Court has struck that down.

10

In that case, incidentally, the Court said that

20

a decree should not only eliminate the discrimination which

21

had existed up to that point, but to prevent future dis-

22

crimination as well.

23

This is the type'of decree we seek, because other­

24

wise we are going to g© back and go through the sauia

25

experience which we have had before.
-

32-

We consider it Inevitable, and the Court has seen

1
■

the resistance.

2

We ask for a restoration of these rights.

In the year 1908 in Ohio, the Democratic candidate

3
4

for Governor of Ohio got, a half million votes, the Republican

5

got about the same, and the Socialist Labor Party got 797.

6

It was ©a the ballot.

'

It
■

W® know in other areas of fundamental rights such

7

8

as the First Amendment, a speaker who addresses a small

9

crowd is permitted to speak just as is the speaker who
addresses the large crowd.

10

It would never be suggested

■

11

the right® can be circumscribed,in the words of Terminal v.

12

Chicago, nT© circumscribe those rights you would have to

13

show a clear and present danger of a present evil that rises

14

far above public inconvenience.*

i

,

15

All that w© are told is that there is a certain

i6

inconvenience to have a small party on the ballot.

17

not a reason to deny the right of that party to compete on

18

an equal basis with the larger political parties.

19

That is

What we ask most of all is for some.guidelines t©

20

the State, to prevent a repetition of the experience that,

21

this party has gone through, where it went for decades en­

22

joying ballot status, and now it is denied that status.

23

We believe that the guidelines should foe that

24
25

States can regulate the accessibility of the ballot to
third parties but not more than is absolutely necessary,
33

j

1

if

2

precision than it has been before, this would certainly

3

advance the causa of participatory democracy and the right,

4

of small groups to participate.

this can be spelled out with some greater clarity and.

5

We have today many small groups in this society

6

who feel strongly, and have burning feelings about issues,

7

and are capable of causing substantial disruption.

8

want to channel the discontent and the dissent into the

9

electoral process?

I say we do.

17

groups, and it should not be prohibitive, and th© retire­

18

ment should be minimal, so that it is easy for them to

19

participate in the political process.

20

We think this is a very important policy considera-”

21

felon which should inspire the Court to make accessibility

22

of the ballot easy, and to encourage groups to participate

23

in this area.

24
25

Finally, we dorffe think that what we feel to be
an invidious discrimination of the small versus the large
34

-

I
!

s

should be dignified by excluding the Socialist Labor Party

2

from the ballot in the November 1968 elections, because it

3

would be saying in effect, this has been the main rationale,

4

in the District Court and in this Court's decision granting

S

temporary relief.

S

what has the Court said about the small size of the. party?

7

While it pointed out there had been delay,

We hope this Court would not dignify a position

8

which says the larger groups shall enjoy these rights, but

9

the smaller groups can't.

10

Q

Mr. Gordon, what do you say to -the representation,

1!

professional representation by the representative of the

i2

Attorney General of Ohio that it is now simply an impossibility

t3

to give you the relief you ask for in 1968?

dealing with a fact as ha represents it to us.

10

done.

A

Mo, because the absentee ballots should go out as

they are, and there is not time on those.

All of these thousands of veterans would be dis­

They could write in, and the write-in is no big

problem with paper ballots, and that is what they have.

They will be able to write in the names of the candidates

which they can do anyway.

Let me ask you this, Mr. Gordon.

You have two

statutes are unconstitutional but that it is too late to

The other is that you want some tempo­

And that is no matter how late you come to this

Court, you had twenty years that you could have tested this
if you wanted to, as a national party, because you have
been a national party for twenty years.

But you think that

regardless of the exigencies of this situation that you
can come in just as late as you want, and without regard to
th© disruption of the election process, you can say to us,
t5In order to do your duty, you have to give us temporary
relief"?
A

Wa say this, Your Honor, that fcha temporary relief

17
was granted to the Wallace group on September 10,

We got

the order on September 11, and we immediately asked the
Secretary of State to place the Socialist Labor Party on

20

the ballot, and he declined.

We gave him notice of the

filing of the motion,

We didn't say that that was going to be final,

and that was a temporary relief that can be changed by the

judgment of this Court,

A

That is correct, but. the point is that there is

2

still time? and Ms we think is the crucial question.

recognize this, that this Court has to weigh the competing ■

equities, and one thing it is going to take into considera­
