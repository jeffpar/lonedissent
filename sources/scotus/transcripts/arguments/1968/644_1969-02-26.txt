ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. MOORE, JR., ESQ.

Ho. 644, Billy Don Franklin

Mr. Chief Justice, Honored members of this

Court, I have been appointed by this Court to present this
Petitioner, Billy Don Franklin Boulden.
The matter before the Court that we raised originally

11

12

was on an involuntary confession.

At a later state, after the

13

Government of the Fifth Circuit, the Witherspoon case came out

14

and.I raise that point also on a stacked jury.
And I talked it over with opposing counsel, both of

15
16

us have commented on it in our briefs, his brief? therefore,

17

I will comment on both these aspects.

18

Q

Was the Witherspoon raised below?

19

A

I did not raise it below in the Fifth Circuit?

20

no, sir.

Because it didn't come out until after I had been

21

at the Fifth Circuit.

22

enough to get started with it.

That is why, your Honor, I wasn't smart

23

Q

What jurisdiction do we have to consider it hereij

24

A

I believe that in my brief 2 have found a. case

25

whereby you can consider it.
2

In Keifer-Stewart versas Seagram the Court pointed

1

2

oat that matters that were not passed on

-

3

Q

That is from a Federal Coart?

4

A

Sir?

5

Q

That is from a Federal Court?

6

Is this from a

Federal Court?

7

Q

a

A

Sir?

9

Q

Knapp'-’against Ohio, is & pretty good authority

A

This is the Supreme Court saying that I was

10

for you.

11
12

referring to her®.
Q

13
14

Yes, but is this case coming here from a

Federal Court?
§i

15

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

X see.

17

A

18

On appeal it started in the State Court in

Alabama.

19

Q

On habeas?

20

A

Yes, sir.

Q

All right.

21
22

23
24
25

A

Then it came through the District Court and

then the Court of Appeals and now we are here.
Q

Yes.

A

I would like to comment first on the aspect ©f
3

1

it, having to do with the involuntary confession.

This is, as

2

I understand, a voluntary confession the totalitary of circum­

3

stances doctrine really gets down to the question of common

4

sens®.

5

Whether or not the accused gave up some right that

0

he had, whether or not he was coerced and whether or not the

individual can be coerced under these circumstances.
And here we have a 19-year old Negro boy who was out
in the woods fishing, a 15-year old white, married girl comes
along and whether he seduced her or not is open to speculation.
In any event, they entered into two acts and as they
were coming back down out of the woods, the Game Warden, who
was unbeknown to either one of them were in the woods halted
them and it is charged that at that point this young boy took
a pistol and shot the game warden.
He apparently lost his head if the evidence is
correct because then he took the officer’s piston and emptied
it and then he was charged with cutting him with a knife some
55 feet through the woods,
A lot of unusual circumstances like it is a small
boy and a 200-pound game warden, no blood on the boy, but the
game warden real bloody, but then we get down into the con­
fession part of it,
Ke was immediately apprehended at the scene or very

24
shortly thereafter,

The girl ran out on the woods and she

25
4

1

hollered and two police officers happened to hear her and came

2

in and apprehended him,,
The State Troopers came in, the local sheriff's organ-

3
4

i^ation — there was some 20 peace officers out there immedi­

5

ately.

6

captain or the State Trooper Captain said he told him he didn't

7

do it.
The girl was brought forward and she said, "That is

8

9

And at that time, according to the record, the police

him."
Then according to the boy he and the Captain had soma

10
11

conversation to the effect 'They want to kill yon and if you

12

don't confess, I am going to turn -them loose on you.8
Prior t© them getting there the atmosphere " was

13
14

building up all this time in that one of these police officers

15

had his gun out and said, "How old are you, boy?"

16

"You are old enough to die."

17

a nigger all day."

He said,

He said, "Run, 1 ain't killed me

And so

With this sort of atmosphere building up all the

18

19

time there immediately took three cars to transport him not

20

back to his home jail but across the river over to an adjoining

21

22
23

24
25

county.
Then the pease officers com® in, the two of them, the
interrogator and the Captain.

And ©na of them has a hidden

microphone and a tape recorder and if you listen to the tap®
you can hear ominous sound of the jail doors opening and
5

i

closing, which means that nothing had gone on until they

2

turned that tape on.

3

And at that time — this is the first question —

4

"Billy, now you understand what we are doing.

5

talk to you, want you to tell us the truth about everything

6

that happened today."

We just want to

That is all the warning he had.

It is in a jail in an adjoining county.

We

will get to those in a bit.
Q

Where did it occur?

That happened in Morgan County.

That happened in Morgan County?

Yes, sir.

and he was riding in the car

Q

Where did it happen?in Morgan County?

4

A

Out in the country from Decatur.

It is out

across the river down there.

Q

Across the river from Decatur?

7

A

Yes.

8

Q

Down toward Hartsville?

9

A

Flint Community is the name of it.

10

Q

Yes.

11

A

It is just a very small community down there.

12

I missed one thing at Flint Community.

He was down there fishing on a creek bank.

The mob

13

started together before they ever took him out of there.

14

was a lot ©f talks lot of people congregating.

15

There

Shay took on in the sheriff's office and put him in

16

a cell there in the jail, up there in Athens, Alabama, the

17

adjoining county from where he was.

18

trying to find him in Morgan and they told him he couldn't see

19

him, couldn't talk to him.

20

His daddy was down there

Well, after they got this tape recording with a

21

hidden microphone and this case is — must have been the same

22

investigator because he said ha was just trying to familiarise

23
24
25

himself with

the criminal.

He was just getting acquainted.

And after he got acquainted for about an hour's worth,
then he came back in there and reduced this confession to

7

1

writing.

2

keep quiet.

3

a lawyer, but they told him finally, it was written in this

4

written confession, that it might be used against him.

New he still hadn’t told him that he had a right to
Nobody ever told him that he might have a right to

5

Q

When was this?

S

A

This was sometime after midnight, your Honor.

7

Q

No, I mean what month and year?

3

A

This is May 1, 19 — a month before Miranda.

0

Q

Yes. Well, as of that time nobody had ever

10

decided that

he did have a right to a lawyer.
No, sir.

Isn't that right?

11

A

I realise that.

12

But the circumstances could be considered whether or

13

not he did have a right to a lawyer but a right to remain

14

silent.

13

never told to him.

16

17

That is my main point.

Q

How

A

Nineteen, sir.

The right to remain silent was

old was this boy?
Weighed about 120 pounds, been

18

sickly, had broken legs, screws in his legs, had a series of

19

headaches, 83 I.Q., sub-normal.

20

said his defensive mechanism would make him do most anything

2!

to avoid immediate danger.

22

the next week but that was his basic defensive mechanism.

23

That is in the record and is also in the brief.

24

25

We had a psychologist that

Not what might happen to him in

I got hold of this first confession and had it
transcribed and it is in the record.
8

They brought the tapes

!

in and 1 think the tapes are also a part of the record now.

2

And this was just conversation in rough language and -the use

3

of four-letter words and this sort of thing, where everybody

4

understood each other they thought there in that jail cell.

5

Then he polished it up a little bit and put it in

8

considerable better form and Billy Don Franklin Boulden signed

7

it»

8
9

The nest morning at 6 osclofck he was carried back t©
Morgan County and Judge Bloodworth was one of the circuit

10

judges there, had him brought in, one door ©pen in the court

11

house, brang State Troopers in the courtroom, and proceeded

12

to tell him his rights.

13

Ke told him that he had a right to a preliminary,

14

he had a right to a hearing on bond and on his own rights,

15

and had a right to an attorney if he couldn3t hire one.

16

they promptly proceeded to carry him off to jail prison.

17

Then

Four days later, I believe it was, two peace officers,

18

these same two State Troopers along with the local sheriff and

19

a Deputy Fire Marshall rod© down there to get him to bring him

20

back to Morgan County.

21

the scene and had him re-enact the scan©, they wired ahead and

22

the State Solicitor was out there with all kinds ©f electronic

23
24
25

And on the way back they stopped by

equipment, and again they had a hidden microphone and led him
around through it and supplied, suggested answers to him which
you can hear ©n the tape.

Q

In your chronical?

A

Yes.

Q

You are down to the third one now?

A

Yes , I am down to the third one where they took

him back to the scene.
Q

First of all, is this the handwriting of the

petitioner?
A

That is

the State Trooper.

Q

That is

the State Trooper?

A

I believe you can

I do see the signature of the petitioner which

seemed to be different.

petitioner's?

No question.

Q

the judge told him he could have a lawyer and so forth.

10
11

I believe I can answer most anything you ask

but I will try.

now.

19

the handcuffs off and said, "All right, lead us through it."

20

And then they reenacted the whole scene out there.

21

Again, nobody told him then by everybody's admission that he

22

had a right to remain silent.

23

told about all these rights by the judge but nobody had done

24

anything about it.

23

This is the third confession

The hidden microphone that he didn't know anything about,

As a matter of fact he had been

If he had had a lawyer he certainly wouldn't have
11

1

made those first two confessions.

z

Here he is out at the scene being told to reenact it

with his handcuffs off, being arraigned by State Troopers, and

4

they had told him about all his rights but nobody had done much

5

about it.

onto this.

7

But he had already confessed twice before we get

2nd, and four days later and we go to trial on May 21st.

not in the trial.

10

I was

This was a lawyer appointed for him up there.

The lawyer was appointed the day before I believe,

11

no, no, no, three or four days before, a week before.

Then he

12

was arraigned and they went to trial on May the 27th.

During

13

the course of the trial this taped-in-1he-woods confession

14

where he reenacted was first read in and as if that wasn't

15

enough, then they played the tapes for the jury just before

16

the jury retired.

17

Now this lawyer that was representing the petitioner

18

objected to the reading, objected to the playing of the tapes

19

and that is all in the record.

20

Q

Or what grounds did he object?

21

h

They went back out of here before the jury and

22

showed it to them — I will answer that in rebuttal, if I may.

23

Q

Sure.

24

A

Let me comment briefly if I may on the second

25

point we raise here and this is the
12

Witherspoon case.

!

s
There are sixteen —

1

in Alabama we have a code

2

section which allows you to ask whether or not you believe in

3

capital punishment, have a fixed thing against capital punish­

4

ment.

5

are set out in detail.

6
7

And sixteen of these people said they did.

And they

Here is a typical one.

"Bradford W. Mixon?

I have a fixed opinion

against capital punishment.

8

Mr. Hundley:

9

The Court:

Challenge.
Defense?

;

10

Mr. Chenault:

Mo questions.

11

The Court:

12

This went on for sixteen times and which we say is

Stand aside, Mr. Mixon."

13

squarely right in the face of this Witherspoon opinion in which

14

six of the jurors said they did not believe in the death

15

penalty and were excused without any attempt to determine

IS
17

18
19
20
21
22

whether they could nevertheless return the verdict of death.
And these sixteen were, with two possible exceptione,
were summarily dismissed and

without any further comment or question.
Q
Mr. E. 0» Moon?
A

25

Now the exceptions were Mr. John L. Nelson and
Exceptions as you call it?

On page 17?

Yes, sir.
I took each one of their testimony as to those

four or five lines there.
Q

And those would be the two what you call

Ho* sir.

What I am talking about, those are

Is that right?

You think you would never be willing to

inflict the death penalty in any type case?

13

Mr. Nelsons

Mr. Hundley;

Well now that might be an exception but ——

They held this young man until Captain John Williams
came to talk with him.
Now the petitioner testified that some one of the
officers threatened to kill him and told him to run and he
would shoot him.
Now we heid at the habeas corpus hearing -—Q

Was that denied?

A

That was denied.

Q

I beg your pardon.

A

Yes? sir.

Q

It was.

A

That is what 1 am going to bring out.

At the

habeas corpus hearing in the District Court in Montgomery we
had an officer? John Brom, B-r-o-m, testify and that is record
page 657 that no one pointed a gun at the petitioner and no one
spoke to him of the crowd.

Yes, sir.

And, of course, Judge Johnson, the District

Judge had the benefit of both of their testimonies.

A

Yes, sir,? as a precautionary measure,,

There had

been a murder committed of a man and there had been a possi­

It was a matter ofsecurity?

This Captain Williams said that he was told the

13

petitioner that he was entitled to a lawyer, what at the time

14

he was being interrogated?

15

A

Yes* sir.

18

Q

Was that the law of Alabama?

17

A

It was not an absolute requirement of Alabama

18

but in that circuit, Judge Bloodworfch was really an advanced

19

judge in thinking at that time.

20
21

Q

He had insisted on those things’

Because it wasn't the law generally?

There wasn’j

any constitutional requirement?

22

A

It was not an absolute requirement at that time.

23

Q

I beg your pardon?

24

A

It was not an absolute requirement at that time.

23

Now, I should like to point out to the Court that an
19

i

1

attorney was appointed at arraignment on May the 7th and a

2

demurrage to the indictment was filed and the case was heard

3

about three weeks later.

What time?

A

I believe it was 10:30 or 11 o’clock, .somewhere

in there.
Q

At night?

A

At night, yes.

He had been fed and was permitted to bathroom
facilities and so forth, and allowed to smoke and there was no
long interrogation.
Q

As a matter of fact you said I wish to make the

following voluntary statement to E. B. Watts.

I am not being

in no way offered no reward, no hope of reward to get me to make
a statement.

I have been told by Mr. Watts that any statement

I make can be used against me in a court of law.

He just

volunteered that statement?
21

22
23
24

A

It is my understanding Mr. Watts asked him those

questions and then wrote it down.
Q

But he says, "I, Billy Watts."

A

Yes, sir.

25

That was written in the confession»

Li. Watts

testified at the habeas corpus that he asked the man these

questions and then wrote it down»

before Judge James Bloodworth and advised of his rights»

showing the advice he gave.

12

He

I believe there are 127 pages in the record*

At hearing that morning at six o8 clock ha advised him

13

of th© seriousness of the offenses* he advised him to get a

14

lawyer, how serious the crimes were* the possibility of a death

15

sentence, and he talked with the parents and relatives of th©

16

boy also* and he told them.

17

That is in the record.

Now, after this hearing and I believe at that time

18

the family was endeavoring to get a Sherman Powell, a local

19

attorney to represent Don Boulden»

20

They were not successful»

Now* because a further precautionary measure* Judge

21

Bloodworth had this man transferred to Kilby Prison»

22

May the 6th the man was brought back from Kilby and indicted

on three indictments* murder* rape and robbery»

Then

He was triad

on the murder.
They brought him back and passed through Coleman and
21

1

then they passed through Decatur, where he reenacted the crime.

Now, a transcription of that tape and those tapes were put in

evidence at the trial.

As this case occurs before either Escobeda or Miranda,

in Arkansas.

He was not advised of these rights by the court I
He was held in communicado for three days without

advice of counsel, friends, relatives, was denied food for long
periods, threatened by violence and so forth.
Now those things in the totality of circumstances
would indicate an involuntary confession of one that was coerced„
Such was not the case in this Boulden matter.
Q

Mr. Clark, it may or may not be material to the

case, I don’t know, but, I was just wondering on the facts
here the petitioner testified that the girl consented.

She

testified she had been raped.
Upon leaving the wooded area where the act took place
the two were confronted by a Conservation Officer for the State
of Alabama.

Then the girl ran away at that time to a nearby

highway where she located a Deputy Sheriff.

The statement on page 5 of the petitioner's brief

"After they were stopped by Hays and prior to the

shooting and sticking Boulden had told Ann Burnett to run, and
24

she did, hence she was not an eye witness when Hays met his

death."

That is just counsel's statement.

On top of page 5.

But we find from the record here no possible sugges­

13
14

tion that Boulden’s. will was overborne on the occasion of the

15

last confession by having made earlier ones.
Wow both the District Court and the Circuit Court of

16
17

Appeals found that the first confession, the one that was not

18

used in the trial, the one on May the 1st, was voluntary and

19

also that the second one was also.
Based on that held that on the totality of the

20

Wow as to this question of Witherspoon, as Mr. Moore

pointed out, Witherspoon took place after we had filed briefs

24

on that.

I would like to point out on the Witherspoon Case that

I would like to point out the difference of Iowa

11

grounds for challenge we have these others but out in Section 57 ,

a conviction should not be had on circumstantial evidence which

I
calls a challenge may be proved by the oath of the person or
by other evidence.
Now, there is a lot of difference between scruples
against capital punishment and a fixed opinion.
Q

The Witherspoon opinion, as I understand it, did

however, didn’t rely much on the words of the statute but
rather what actually happened in the voir dire of the jury.

A

Yes.

And that x^ould be the test in any case, under

the Witherspoon Opinion?
A

people to death when that is what their duty requires.

A

That is true.

They have a fixed opinion but a

Of course# that question wasn't asked would they

find the person guilty and sentence them to death under any

It was asked of two of the jurors.

On page 17, Mr. Kelson

thought was a fixed opinion.

5

Q

That is what, according to the most recent

the United States are against capital punishment as a matter

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

17

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. MOORE, JR., ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19

20

Mr. Moore.

MR. MOORE:

May it please the Court, in rebuttal I

have a few notes set down here.
No. 1, my good friend Mr. Dave Clark says this

21

22

involved curiosity seekers.

When you get to reading the record

23

you will see in there that the Solicitor commented very firmly

24

t on it, that he was trying to send a man down to Kilby for safe\

25

keeping„

29

1

2

Because he said, "Judge, you know he knows what
happened out there at Flint last night when that mob gathered."
Then we get on dawn into what Boulden told the girl

3
4

at the scene.

5

told the girl to run.

6

if he did

The record, Mr. Justice, will reveal that Boulden
She was not an eye witness to the murder

kill him, which he has denied since then.

7

Q

He was murdered?

3

A

That is correct.

9

We thought it particularly appropriate and did set

10

out on page 24 in here what led up to this thing, her testimony,

11

and she did testify as to their acts up there in the woods.

52

The precautions he used, he used a contraceptive on both times.

13

And this is spelled out by

14

indicating that now this rape thing was an afterthought when

13

she got down there and saw that peace officer.

16

her own testimony in some detail,

And Boulden is the one that told her to run.

To me,

17

one of the most impressive items in this whole thing here is

18

that these officers wanted a confession.

19

fession to convict.

They wanted a con­

They weren't looking for who did it.

They

20

thought they had found and under one of the outstanding opinions

21

of this court they were after a confession on which they could

22
23
24
23

convict and could hang this man.
He was never told at any time that you don't have to
talk to us, that you have got a right to remain quiet.

Just

because they didn't put him on bread and water and put a lash
30

1

on his back doesn’t mean he wasn’t coerced.

Just because his

2

bathroom privileges weren’t taken away from him and they gave

3

him a couple of cigarettes doesn't mean he wasn’t coerced.
When those two peace officers ware standing there

4
5

with this man in his call with those doors behind him telling

6

him we want to know what happened* a little bitty 120-pound boy

s bowed up at the trial,
17
18

Q

And the girl said he did?

A

That is correct.

Q

Is there any indication that anybody else could

19

20

have, done this?
21

A

He has said so, your Honor.

Q

What?

A

He has said so later when he got before the

22
23
24

Government, he said at that time that two other men showed up
25

/

31

1

on the scene and did it and he said they threatened his family

2

and he was trying to protect his family.

3

for that one way or the other.

4
5

6

Again, I cannot vouch

The circumstances.1 have said throughout are strange.
I went up there and got the bloody clothes and brought it down.
Q

How long was it after the girl ran to the street

7

or the road, highway, when the officers came back down to where

8

he was killed?

9

A

Very shortly.

10

Q

What?

A

Very shortly.

How far was it?

A

Less than a mile, about a half a mile to a mile.

Q

And they came right back?

A

Very shortly, your Honor.

Q

That is the only information they had was what

Yes, sir.

she gave them?
A

This is correct.

Q

That this boy had killed him?

A

That is right.

Q

Where was he then?

A

He was back down there in the woods.

Kis story

had been changed that two men came up and were fishing.
again, I am not trying my lawsuit on this.
Q

I understand that.

Office and he told it

3

And that is when 1 got in the case, in the District Court.

4

Judge Johnson’s department was the first association I had ever

5

had with the case.
Q

6

This is what he told when he got to the Governor’s
when we started in the District Court»

What happened when these two officers and the

7

girl had reported to* carae to him or he came to them?

any scuffle or anything of that kind?

12

14
15

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Q

Was

he running away or anything?

A

The record doesn’t reveal that, your Honor.

My

recollection as to whether he was actually running at that time
or not*, I think he was just out there in the woods, is about all
we know.
But never was ha told that he had a right to remain

16

17

Apparently they just apprehended him is the way

I read the record and then called for the Highway Patrol.

11

13

Was there

silent.

I think you have got to know what a right is, know

that you have got one before you can give it up.
Q

Did he testify at the trial?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

What did he say?

He did.
Did he say that he thought

somebody else killed the man?
A

Wot at that time.

Q

At the trial?

A

No, sir, he did not.

25
33

Wo, sir.

1

Q

Did ha admit that he did?

2

A

Yes, sir,

3

Q

At the trial?

4

A

At the trial.

5

Q

Did he testify?

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

And he admitted the killing?

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Again, he said that he was protecting his family.

10
11

That is what he said at a later time.
Q

His defense, as I understand it, was that he saw

12

this girl and he invited her to go out in the woods with him and

13

she went with him?

14

A

That is right.

13

Q

And they had intercourse and he then, when they

16

arrested and tried him he admitted that and admitted that he

17

shot the officer.

There was no other defense was there?

13

A

This is true.

19

Q

Admitted that he shot him and that was the trial?

20

That was all the evidence, wasnst it?

21

A

Yes.

22

Q

When he testified at the trial, did he say whet

23

this officer had told him that he had been wanting a long time

24

to kill a nigger?

25

A

He testified to that in the District Court here.
34

1

In the original hearing I don't think it was ever asked of him.

2

Nof sir»

Not at the original trial.

3

Q

Well, he was asked about the shooting, wasn't he?

4

A

He was asked about the shooting.

5

Q

And he didn't say anything about that statement

0
7

made by him?
A

No, sir.
He was asked a series of questions just about

8
9

right along in the form of this confession that was taken out

SO

there in the scene where he reenacted, where they took his

11

handcuffs off and when you read it you will see he said, "Well,

12

I am even glad to get my handcuffs back on,” because he was

13

arraigned with security people out there then.

14
15
IS
17

Again, nobody ever told him he had a right to keep
his mouth shut.
Q

But when he was testifying in the trial, what

did he say was his reason for shooting the man?

18

A

I don’t know if anybody ever asked him that.

19

Q

I thought you said he was doing it to protect

20

his family?

21

22
23
24
