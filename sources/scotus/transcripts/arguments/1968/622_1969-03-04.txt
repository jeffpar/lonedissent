Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

This is a Federal habeas corpus proceeding on behalf
of William Maxwell, a condemned man, challenging the sentence
of death imposed upon him by an Arkansas jury.
Unlike the Boykin case which the Court has just heard,

14
15

Mr. Amsterdam.

the Court.

11
12

Counsel are present.

no question is presented here with regard to the ultimate power
of the State of Arkansas to use death as a penalty for crime.
Even for the crime of rape of which William Maxwell was con­
victed.
The questions presented relate entirely to the
procedures by which the death penalty is administered in the
State of Arkansas and by which out of the total number of
persons convicted of the crime of rape, some are selected to
live, and others are selected to die.
We have two Federal constitutional claims against the
Arkansas procedure which for short reference I may terra the
3

1

standards claim and the single verdict claim.

2

In order to put into perspective and to show their

3

relationship, because I think they are intimately related, I

4

would like to take a hard look at the outset if I may at the

5

procedure by which Arkansas does determine, case by case,

6

individual cases whether persons convicted of rape shall live

7

or shall go to their death in the electric chair,
■

Sew, under Arkansas law there is one statutory pro™

8
9

rision which provides that the punishment for the crime of rape

10

is death.

11

in any case in which the punishment is death by law, the jury

12

may return instead a verdict of imprisonment for life in the

Another statute in effect since 1915 provides that

State Penitentiary,
The effect, of these two statutes, therefore, is to
create an authorization, the availability of returning the
death penalty in a broad range of cases, but to require the
death penalty in none.
Thereby, both supposing that selection is possible
among the total number of parsons convicted of rape and re™
quiring that selection must in fact be made among the total
number of persons convicted of rape of some smaller number
who shall suffer death, the extreme penalty for that crime.
Now it is not surprising that such a selective
process is set in motion by Arkansas law because the crime of
rape is in Arkansas as elsewhere a crime that includes a wide

and the trial in a capital case in Arkansas is not unusual in

10

this regard.

person in Arkansas who has previously been tried for rape or

we are in a different world.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G» AMSTERDAM* ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM:

8
9
10

if I may* I would like to resume a

brief description of the exact nature of the discretion that
the Arkansas jury has in capital sentencing.
As I have said* there are no prerequisite factual

11
12

findings to return a death verdict.

And the jury need find

13

nothing specific in aggravation of the sort that, for example,

14

the European Codes use, that the offense was committed with a

15

weapon, or that the defendant had a prior conviction to a

16

similar offense or any such thing.
There is no general required finding of fact such as

17
18

that the defendant is unreformable or incurable or any such

59

thing.

There are no preclusive findings of fact.

That is,,

/

20
21

22
23
24
25

findings which will exclude the death penalty.
The jury is not told if you find that the defendant
was suffering a mental disease or defect which rendered him
unstable, or that the defendant has no prior record, or that
the victim did not use a great degree of force and resistance
or that the defendant did not us® a weapon, you may not sentence
9

1

to death.

And there are similarly no general preclusive

2

findings on the nature of emotional disorder or any such thing.
There is no direction to the jury that it shall take

3
4

consideration of any particular range or realm of fact.

5

jury is not told in deciding whether to sentence the defendant

6

to life or death you shall take into account whether the

7

8

9

defendant used a weapon or whether the victim was previously
chased or the character of the defendant or any of those
things.
There is not even an authorisation which would direct

10
11
12
13
14
15

their attention to some things# that you may take account of.
The jury is not. told that there are things that they may not
take account of, may not take account of race, may not take
account of anything that the legislature thinks irrelevant to
its purposes in enacting the death penalty.
There are no principles for judgment, no standards

16
17

for judgment given to the jury at all.
Not even a kind of vague standard that is the minimum

18
19

20
21

The

we use in any kind of other judicial proceedings, such as
reasonable man.

It is sometimes easy to forget how much the

reasonable man standard does direct the jury in a civil damage
case.

At least the jury knows that the defendant's obligation

22
23

is to exercise reasonable care, the care that a reasonable man
would exercise toward the plaintiff.

24

Our whole law assumes that that has significance.
25

10

It

1

is different from the duty the defendant owes to a trespasser

z

to exercise somewhat less care than he might owe to someone

3

whom he has a special duty to care for.

4

The jury in a civil case isn't told that they may

5

return a verdict against the defendant if they don't like him,

6

or if there is something offensive about him or any such thing.

7

The issue is frank.

8

or may not be.

In non-capital sentencing, there may

But even if there are no standards given,

explicitly by statute, the kind of discretion he exercises is
very different than that which a jury exercises in sentencing
to death, for a number of reasons.
One is that the judge is a professional sentencer.
And although we make no attack on the jury system as such, we
think that we need not get anywhere near attacking the jury as
an administrator of rules.

It is very clear that a professional,

sentencer is better at formulating rules, adjudication by
adjudication than an ad hoc group of 12 people.
11

1

2

Q

This point rests on your faith in a professional

rather than a State having furnished any standards?
A

3

There are a number of relevant points.

The

4

noncapital sentencing apart from the professional quality of

5

the judge, professionalism, your Honor, is a number of things

8

all wrapped into one.
One the fact that the judge sentences a number of

7

8

cases involves some consistency.

9

each time.

10

And if only the consistency of habit, there is a

consistency there.
Q

11
12

He is the man who does it

The State's contribution is in furnishing the

professional I take it rather than furnishing a standard?
A

13

I think that is right insofar as certain stand­

14

ards are build into the assumptions of the system which are

15

not build into capital sentencing, such as rehabilitation,

16

When a judge sentences he knows that the man whom he is going

17
18

to sentence is going to come out after a period of time.

And

he has to make a judgment as to whether the period is so severe

19

that the man is going to be a serious danger from a rehabili­

20

tative standpoint afterwards.
It is not true of the capital sentencing decision.

21

22

It is also true that
Q

23

that direct a judge specifically to take rehabilitation into
account?

are true in capital sentencing.
Q

What would you say about a state, Mr. Amsterdam,

that just imposed a mandatory death sentence?
A

A mandatory death sentence it would have none

of the problems that this case raises. I would have troubles
depending on the nature of the statute under other constitutional
provision but none that are involved in this case.
Q

No* I realize that, but there would no standards

of any kind involved there except the legislative judgment of
this particular crime without more carried in the legislature's
point of view a death sentence.

Your Honor, that is a standard though.

we are complaining about in this case, an

individualizing process which selects without whim or reason

because he takes a different view of the fact in this case

than the facts in «mother case, but because it may take a

totally different view of a legal determinant, or it may find

8

it did have no legal determinant, to sentence one man to live

Q

It is not involved where you have mandatory

Mr. Amsterdam, is the rule for which you are

contending here confined to capital cases?

There are in some

states procedures by which a noncapital cases juries fix the
penalty and they have a range of discretion.
Is a constitutional rule for which you are here
contending, such as it would follow that standards would have
to be prescribed in such cases?
A

Our contention is limited to capital cases

and the justification for our so limiting it lies in three
things, 1 think.
First, this Court has made clear for considerable
period of time that the degree of arbitrariness that is
14

1

permissible in a sentencing system is less where the penalty

2

is greater»

3

held you couldn't sterilize thieves if you didn't sterilize

4

embezzlers.

I speak of Skinner versus Oklahoma.

Nov/ Skinner

I think that nobody on the unanimous court that

5
6

decided that case assumed,, and indeed the opinion said the

7

contrary, that you couldn't sentence embezzlers to 15 years and

8

sentence thieves to 10.
At that level of discrimination or determination there

9
10

11

13
14
15
16

17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

is no question about distinguishing between embezzlers and
thieves.

When you sterilize them or when you kill them, that

is something else again.
The second consideration I think is that — and this
goes to Mr. Justice White's point as well, that when you are
dealing with a noncapital sentencing regime, there are a number
of considerations that come into play that justify more arbi­
trary individualized judgments than when you are dealing with
a capital sentencing regime„
Noncapital sentencing inevitably involves in some
part the question of reformation.

And the only tools with

which we as a society at the moment come to grips with the
question of reformation are the highly individualized diagnostic
judgments that are made of particular individuals.
Now, I myself have very serious troubles with the
infusion of therapy in the sentencing because sentencing becomes
15

1

a mixed bag of individualized, supposedly helpful, therapeutic

2

considerations and penal judgments, but the question as to what

3

kind of standards to apply in that process is much more like

4

the question involved in the Gault case as to how much you can

S

justify some arbitrariness in the imposition of penal sanctions

6

in order to serve therapeutic ends which require extreme

7

flexibility,,

8
9

In capital sentencing there is no therapeutic need
and no therapeutic justification.

The death penalty is the

10

If

purposes of reformation or rehabilitation.

12

of this human creature as fit for rehabilitation and no indi­

13

vidual judgments of the sort that need to be made diagnostically

14

enter into judgment.

It is a writing off

15

So that there is no excuse for the degree of indi­

that there is in our case.

Q

I want to be sure I understand you.

Are you

19

saying that your view, a Constitution presents no barrier to

20

a State system under which, for example, a jury might be given

21

discretion to impose a sentence of between 1 year and 100 years?

22

A

Your Honor, I am simply saying that this case

23

doesn't present that question.

24

is a grave constitutional deficiency.

25

Q

My personal view is that there

That is what I wanted to find out.
16

I know this

«i

case doesn't present quite that, but I take it that the theory

2

that you are advocating here might extend to that and by the

3

same token I suppose it would extend to something like the

4

California adult authority procedure.
That is to say, that you have the same problems as

5

to whether that procedure might be defective for lack of

standards.

I think that a great deal depends on several

25

I think there is

standards for jury action may not be that a judge has to have
standards.

I think that the parameters, the outer boundaries

of judgment are very important.
If 1 mey, let me try to frame this issue in terms of
one that is more familiar to this Court's jurisprudence
historically.
The question that is raised as I see it by our
standards attack, it is not a typical question of how you limit
discretion and keep it within constitutional confines.

If you

fake, for example, a legislature that wants to regulate parades
in the State, if could simply pass a permit statute that says
no one may conduct a procession without a permit from the
17

1

Chief of Police,

2

tional difficulties under the decisions of this court.

3

if it wanted to enact one thatdalimited the discretion, how

4

might it go about it?

7

Now

There are a whole host of ways in which it might go

5
6

Now that would raise the gravest constitu­

about it.
One, it might say whoever conducts a procession with

e

vehicles or a procession on the street or a procession on

9

Pennsylvania Avenue between 14th Street and. the Capitol, that

10
11

delimits the range of cases in which the judgment is being made.
Secondly, it might say that in determining whether a

12

permit shall issue, the Chief of Police shall take account of

13

traffic congestion, the movement of emergency vehicles, simply

14

whether there is not a parade or procession that same day and

15

:hat sort of thing.

16

Third, it might subject the judgment of the permit

17

issue to review by another agency, by a court.

18

of these, without getting rid of discretion totally, delimits

19

the discretion and again it would make a considerable difference

20

whether the permit was totally unavailable or whether the permit

21

only had the power to put it off for a day, set it sometime

22

within the week, but not on the particular day requested.

23
24
25

Q

Now each one

Well, unhappily, your last discussion suggests

the possibility that you may have two questions:

One, the

immediate question, I spend it is necessary, and the next
18

question, when the next ball game is played, which is, are

z

these particular standards appropriate and adequate?

3

A

Precisely.

And what I think we — where I think

4

we are in this case is where this court was in 1930 when it

5

first began to enact ordinances.

6

an Arkansas procedure which has available to it all of the

7

different, devices by which they might control the discretion,

limiting the range of cases to which it applies, providing for

It simply has to say whether

cluding the death penalty when certain mitigating findings are
mad®, establishing rules or principles or even just telling the
jury so that they have something to talk about when they go
back there and they all have to agree.
That you must come to a decision constant with
certain principles.
Q

Just so there won't be any misunderstanding

again so far as I am concerned, with respect to judge sentencing,
are you saying that as a matter of your understanding of the
Constitution of the United States, it is not necessary that
the standards be prescribed to guide the judge, for the reasons
that you have so well stated here in deciding whether he will
impose the death sentence or something less?
A

I am not saying that the Constitution does not

23
require standards of the judge.

I am only saying that this

24
case does net raise if.

Q

That is what 1 wanted to be clear on.

Now,

2

finally, and this is my last question of you, what we have been

3

discussing in this colloquy would apply more or less to the

4

same to your second point, namely the need for a unitary,

5

your objection to a unitary trial.

6

Is that correct?

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

You, in answer to Mr. Justice Fortas8 initial

9

question in this series about distinguishing a capital sentence

10

from an ordinary sentence and you said there were three dis­

11

tinctions .

You got as far as two.

12

The Skinner against Oklahoma distinction and the

13

absence of any therapeutic possible of arguable therapeutic

14

purpose in a capital sentence.

15

What was the third?

16

A

Thank you, Mr. Justice Stewart.

The third is

17

more limited to Arkansas in this case.

18

Supreme Court does review sentencing imposed by juries in non­

19

capital cases and it does not in capital cases.

20

25

It is that, the Arkansas

And, as I was trying to sketch out, it makes for me
a great deal of difference whether the discretion is limited by
a review or whether it is not.

That is one of the factors that

makes the discretion given juries in death cases totally
arbitrary with no restraint, no protection against abuse.
Now, I am not passing at this point beyond the
20

1

standards argument-

2

simply of describing the standardless trial-

3

finish, if I may, ray description of the trial process and then

4

state briefly the two constitutional contentions that emerge

5

from it.

6

I launched off into this in the course
I would like to

The Arkansas jury not only makes the guilt and penalty

7

determinations, but makes them at one sitting if the defendant

8

contests guilt.

All the evidence submitted on all questions is sub­

10

mitted at once.

11

on guilt and on punishment.

12

The jury goes out and returns a verdict both

of this is fairly obvious.

If the defendant takes the stand

intended to protect him against.
First, if he takes the stand and doesn't claim
innocence, he is going to be convicted.

There is justro doubt

that a jury will convict a man x^ho gets on the stand and
testifies and doesn’t say 1 didn’t do it.
If he gets on the stand and he does testify that he
didn't do it, he is subject to cross-examination, which is
clearly potentially incriminating.

In addition to that, under

Arkansas procedure he is subject to impeachment of the most
21

1

vicious sort* literally every bad act however remote and

2

whether reduced to conviction or not can come in against him

3

with inevitable prejudice on the guilt determination»

4

Q

You mean every act. throughout his entire life?

5

A

There is only one limitation that I know of,

6

your Honor.

7

a bad act which is too remote may not be proved, but the Arkansas

©

Court has admitted, for example, a minor liquor violation 20

9

years old, an automobile accident, 24

10

years old, those sorts

of things.
So I think the remoteness requirement is insignificant

11

12

There are a couple of Arkansas cases that say that

and the practical fact of the matter is that however prejudicial,

13

for example, we have cited in our brief cases in which a man

14

on trial for murder when he took the stand was impeached by

15

showing that he had committed a prior murder.
Its relevance to credibility is questionable but

its prejudice on the guilt issue is obvious.

kind of thing for which he lets himself in if he takes the
stand.
On the other hand, if he doesn't take the stand he
literally goes to slaughter like a dumb beast.
of his best witness on facts in mitigation.

He is deprived

He is the only

person who can tell about his motivation, particular circum­
stances that may have led up to the act for which he subse­
quently convicted which may convince the jury in its totally
22

1

unfettered discretion not to sentence him to death.

He is the

2

best witness on background facts, facts about his childhood,

3

his upbringing that the jury may take into account.

4

But more than that, his testimony is the only thing

5

:hat can bring home the jury that they are sentencing a human,

6

a. live human being whom they have heard speak like other human

7

beings and it is the characteristic of speech that human beings

8

have.

They are sentencing such a person to death and what

happens in a case like William Maxwell is, if the defendant
decides that he is going to exercise his privilege against
self-incrimination and not take the stand and not be subject
to impeachment and not prove guilt out of his own mouth, he
goes to life or death decision without the jury ever having
heard a word uttered by him.
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, you stated earlier in your argu­

ment that in Arkansas, as I suppose in other States, the
statutory offense of rape can cover a very wide spectrum
actually of human conduct.
As far as I can see we don't have anything of the
facts of this case.

We don't have the trial transcript, we

don't have any description of what the actual conduct was here
and I suppose that the theory of Arkansas, rightly or wrongly,

22
23

is that the jury’s discretion is to be exercised in the light
of what they hear from the witness stand as to the particular

24

circumstances constituting this particular statutory violation.
25

23

f

And that we don't have here at ali»

As to

Arkansas' taking any position that the jury does indeed rely

11

on those facts, the answer is we simply don't know.

Q

Well, I suppose ——

A

It is not required to.

Q

Well, the jury hears the case for the prosecution

on the .issue of innocence or guilt and as I say as you rightly
point out that is about all it hears.

And so I suppose the

theory must be that it is to exercise its sentencing discretion
based upon what it has heard from the witness stand with regard
to the circumstances of this statutory violation.
A

I suppose that might be.

The proof doesn't seem

to meet the theory because the evidence that we have gathered
indicates that there are three factors which distinguish people
who are sentenced to death and people who are sentenced to
life generally in Arkansas.
Race, the Commission

of contemporaneous offense, some
24

?

other offense like robbery, which Maxwell did not commit and

z

a prior record imprisonment and we do not know whether Maxwell

3

has any prior record of imprisonment on this record.

4

Q

Now, do we know from the trial record?

5

A

We would not know from the trial record.

6

Q

He did not take the stand?

7

A

By exercising the privilege avoided going into

8

the question of background at all, with the result — and this

D

is quite typical — that a defendant who claims the privilege

10

has the jury decide whether or not he should live based on five

11

minutes of his life, or ten minutes of his life.

12

All they know about this man is what they have heard

13

that he did in the few minutes constituting the crime, no more

14

than that is known.
Now, whether or not the theory of Arkansas is that

15

16

they act on that, our theory is that they need not act on that

17

under Arkansas law.

18

something broader than that if it is presented, but the defendan

19

can present it only at the cost of waiving his Federal consti­

20

tutional privilege against self-incrimination.

Appeals?
A

Mr. Justice, the status of the trial transcript
25

1

in this case is very confused.

£

best I can.

Let me state it as briefly as

3

The pretrial order of the Federal District Judge in

4

this case provided that the transcript would be available and

5

that portions of it might be put into the record by counsel if

6

they wished.
Wo portions ware formally put into the record.

7

On

8

the other handy the trial transcript had been around in the

9

District Court for a long while.

This being Maxwell’s second

10

habeas corpus petition, and the District Judge in fact relied

11

on it in some part, although none of it was formally introduced,

!2

for some of his findings, such as the finding that Maxwell did

13

not take the stand.
The transcript, because it was not in the record in

14
15

the District Court, did not go up to the 8th Circuit.

16

before the decision by the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit,

17
18

the Clerk of that Court wrote counsel asking that a copy of the
trial transcript be furnished.
And the Court of Appeals also relied on certain

19

21

22
23
24
25

Shortly

aspects of it such as portions of the opening argument by
defense counsel, and that sort of thing.

Again, formally it is

not here.
I do not think that the transcript is in fact before
this court.

It is not physically here, but I do not think that

it is in fact here.

However, certainly those facts which appear
26

1

in the opinions below or in the opinion of the Arkansas Supreme

z

Court might properly be relied on by this Court.

3

Q

Well, I suppose it is a public record then?

4

A

Oh, yes.

And I don't think ■— indeed we have

8

gone to the point of actually in our Appendix say, quoting a

6

portion of it, not otherwise introduced.

7

controversial.

8
9
10
11

12

Q

We think it is Ron-

It is a public record.
And it is now lodged, so far as you know, with

the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals?
A

I don't know that it is technically lodged there.

It certainly was sent there.

And they do have a copy.

Now, if I may briefly pass from what I had intended

13

to be merely descriptive to the argument, the standards question

14

seems to be resolved by the briefing in this case, in a

15

relatively simple matter.

16

We contend that the power given Arkansas juries to

17

sentence to life or death is legally arbitrary in violation of

18

the rule of due process.

19

the rule of law that this Court has found previously in the

20

due process clause.

21
22
23
24
25

It offends, we think, every aspect of

First of all, it involves sentencing on a case-by-case
basis, by jurors who need not even discuss why they choose to
send a man to death.

If they do discuss why and they decide

on a common ground, there is no assurance that that ground is
common to any other defendant but this defendant.
27

The man who is just tried and just convicted and just

1

2

sentenced to life might have facts identical with those of

3

the defendant who now goes to death, the only difference being

4

that because Arkansas provides no help, the juries take differen t

5

views, not of the facts, but of the law»
A necessary consequence of that kind of arbitrariness

6
7

in decision-making is that people are unequally treated in

8

violation of the notion basic we submit the both due process

9

and equal protection that requires even-handed administration

10

of justice, people treated similarly»

11

That doesn8t mean individualisation in sentencing but

12

it means individualization on a rational basis, not on a hit or

13

miss fluke basis that arises from having no standards whatever

14

from making the sentencing decision.
It also means that not only are the people who are

15
1S
17
18
19
20

sentenced to death treated unevenly, unequally, as against
those sentenced for life, but they are treated irrationally
in the sense that there is no relationship, no assured connec­
tion between the purposes for having a death penalty law and*
its imposition in this case.
There is nothing to assure that whatever Arkansas

21

22
23
24
25

may want to achieve by allowing rapes to be punished by death,
that on the facts of this particular case the justification
attaches.
Q

Is the Arkansas practice differ in any way from
28

the practice in the Federal Courts under statutes where the

2

death penalty is permitted and to be fixed by the jury?

Now what we have in Arkansas — and this is what I
think is so relevant of the racial evidence on this record -—
is a sentencing pattern of clear racial discrimination.

It

couldn't be caught said the District Court because the factors
that go into the jury’s decision case by case are so intangible,
so difficult to catch on to, that you can’t prove that even a
jury which, even a set of juries which convict Negroes of raping
white victims and sentencing them to death, this proportionately
frequently are in fact discriminating.

We don’t know.

22
There may be all sorts of intangible factors other

than race that affects it.

but Maxwell's jury probably didn't discriminate.

3

Again, how do you know?

4

There is no way.

The jury didn't have to have any

penalty and so what happens under a regime of this sort is not

only the giving up of all political responsibility in the

representatives of the people, the Legislature, to fix standards

of general application, passing the buck in effect to individual

10

juries, but when individual juries react in a way which violates

11

the most clear and unequivocal commands of the Constitution,

12

a court can't catch the matter.

13
14
15
16
17
18

Our submission essentially is that such a regime
violates the rule of law basic to due process.

That there is

inherent in the very notion of due process of law the requiremenL
of a rule of law which governs like cases and applies.
I think that this Court would not, for example,
sustain an Arkansas sentencing procedure which provided that

19

every man convicted of rape should roll the dice and if it came

20

up 7 or 11 he would die and any other numbers, he would live.

21

22
23

24
25

Actually, what Arkansas has done is worse.

It is

worse because I assume that the dice would not discriminate on
grounds of race and it is worse because the 2 out of 12 chances
that each man would have are at least identical.
We have not even that assurance and the argument is
32

1

made by Arkansas and it is made by California that everybody is

2

being treated even-handedly and equally under this sentencing

3

procedure.
Q

you or not?

Suppose that it

Would that satisfy

Whan I say satisfy you, I beg your pardon, I mean

of course in terms of your view of the constitutional require­
ment.
A

As far as the Federal Constitution was concerned,

it would satisfy our demands for a constitutional rule of law
provided that the following conditions were met.

One, that the

standards were announced by the highest Court of the State or
at least approved by it so that the same standards were announced
by different trial judges in different cases.
Two, that the standards were made clear before the
trial so that the defendant would have a fair opportunity to
know what he was trying at the trial.
Provided that those two conditions were met, and that
the standards themselves met the substantive requirements of

25
33

1

definiteness for standards, it wouldn’t matter whether they

2

were done legislatively or judicially.

3

And I would think the matter of State policy it would

4

be quite improper for the Court to promulgate these, just as I

5

was going to suggest, I am troubled about suggesting specific

8

standards to this Court because the individual standards that

7

one desires are responsive to the most fundamental penalogical

0

policy questions as to why use the death penalty and when.
Q

9

I understand that, but as far as 1 am concerned,

10

it is a little difficult to think about your point in the ab-

11

stract without having soma fairly specific idea of what kinds

12

of standards or what kind or kinds of standards the Federal

13

Constitution would regard as within the limit of the consti­

14

tutional toleration.

15

A

Let me respond to that in two ways.

16

First, by saying that I had in mind something not

17

terribly unlike the approach taken by the model penal code.

18

Although that is not an exclusive approach.

19

1 voice caution for two reasons, first of all, the Model Penal

20

Code’s description of the aggregating and mitigating circum­

21

stances and that sort of thing applies to murder and not rape.

And although again

So, it is of no use particularly in drafting a rape

S

I think that

The second way to respond to that is to try to give
you what 1 think of is in some ways in which a Legislature

10

concerned with the crime of rape might put standards into a

11

sentencing statute»
One way they might go about is in the manner I

12
13

The jury may not impose the death penalty unless it

finds that the defendant used a weapon, that he injured the

offense on a victim of gravely disparate age»

21

half a dozen but I say simply that is one approach.

22

Q

One can enumerate

You see, the difficulty that that raises and I

23

am sure it is obvious to you is that suppose the Legislature

says, "Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Amsterdam, that is not what we mean.

1

In other words, that what you are talking about is

2

standards which in effect redefine the crime.

You are really saying to the Legislature, "No, you
may not impose the death penalty except for this kind of rape."
A

No, I don't think that is necessarily so.

I

have trouble in conceiving the matter that way for two reasons.
One, the Arkansas Legislature hasn't released any
old kind of rape.

It said the death penalty is available for

any old kind of rape, but we really don't expect that it will
be imposed for any old kind of rape.
It is going to be imposed either wholly arbitrarily
or in some set of

subclasses and it has made no attempt what­

ever to define those subclasses.
But, in addition to that, this is only one of the
ways in which a Legislature might regularize the procedure.
The Legislature said that the governing issue was the atrocity
of the crime.

At least that would allow the jury to consider

that in focusing on that as distinguished from the character
36

of the defendant„

2

l£ the Legislature said, I!Yes, any old kind of rape/’

could apply which would focus in far more than we have the

issue which is before the jury.

in the 1920's, in which -— and I remember it because my father

was counsel for the petitioner in the case and I was a little

boy — in which Ohio, which has a somewhat similar system to

11

Arkansas', but this was for first degree murder, had not allowed

12

the counsel for the defendant to even argue to the jury that

13

they should extend, recommend mercy, as that State says, and

that decision was either affirmed or certiorari was denied.

15

I have forgotten which.

Mr. Justice Stewart, my statement that counsel

are permitted to argue to the jury rises from my observation of
reading transcripts in Arkansas death cases.

There is no

decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court which specifically talks
about counsel arguing to the jury at all, let alone defining
what arguments are proper and what arguments are not.
39

One can find nothing in Arkansas case law that is

Q

There is a great deal of the rationale, Mr.

Amsterdam, of the opinion in the Witherspoon case was based
upon the very premise that a jury under our system, the system
followed conventionally in most of the States is allowed to
roam essentially at large in deciding whether or not to impose
capital punishment.

Q

The question was not raised in Witherspoon

done it, and the question was whether you can give the jury
unfettered discretion, and skew people who exercised it.

of the Attorney General of Arkansas speaking here, particularly

and exclusively with respect to the first question that is

presented in this case.

10

California and Arkansas in this matter of sentencing

procedures in capital cases share really only one common

12

elements and that is the element of leaving it to the jury to

determine whether or not life sentence should be imposed in­

That is precisely

is my understanding that that is the case in

Arkansas.
But I want to make it clear that on this question of
the unitary trial, we do not express any view because we in
this guilt proceeding meet the objections that are raised in
terms of information being made available to the jury? both
sides are free to put in evidence in mitigation or evidence in
aggrevation and they are both free to go into the background
of the defendant and to go into anything that is relevant.
Of course, it has to be competent evidence.
is very common to call psychiatrists.

And it

The defendant may call

a psychiatrist who says he has examined the defendant and he is
familiar with criminal characters and under

his judgment this —

man can be rehabilitated.
There is all sorts of evidence and certainly all of
the things that would go into a judge sentencing on the basis
of a probationary report or a diagnostic reports in our

25
50

1

noncapital cases„

2

raised and as far as it is tied into the lack of standards,, we

3

meet that very well in California.
Now I am not sc sure it is a benefit to the defendant.

4

3
€

7

Certainly the bifurcated trial was enacted as a means of giving
the jury the fullest information before it passed sentence, and
I think that is a good idea.
To say that it benefits the defendant is something

8
9
10
11

else again because the defendant is stuck with his own record.
He made his life and if it hasn’t been a good one, he will suffe e
for it in a penalty trial.

14

There is no question about it.

It can be very difficult for the defendant whether or

12
13

So I think as far as that objection is

not in the long run it is better to bifurcate or whether it is
better and gives the defendant a better shot at it to let it
all go in one trial, limit the jury to what is admissible on

15
16

the murder charge or rape charge or whatever, is quite another
question.

17

In any event, we proceed on the bifurcated trial.

We

18

also have some provisions for review which have been mentioned
19

in briefs particularly filed by the petitioner who argues that
20

the Arkansas jury verdict is unreviewable, for all purposes.
21

Q

Before you get to that, may I ask you whether at

22
the end of the penalty trial there are any instructions given by
23

the judge, and if so, what they are?
24

A

At the end of the penalty trial the jury is

25

51

1

instructed in a standard instruction that it is the duty of the

2

jury to determine which of the penalties, death sentence or

3

life imprisonment, which should be imposed.

5

I won't read the

You should consider all of the evidence received here

And that would normally include all of the evidence
on the guilt phase as well.
You may consider also all of the evidence of the

circumstances surrounding the crime, of the defendant's back­

ground of history, and of the facts in aggravation or mitigation

of the penalty which has been received here in court.

14

However, it is not essential to your decision that you

15

find mitigating circumstances on the one hand or evidence in

16

aggrevation of the offense on the other.

17

It is the law of this State that every person guilty

18

of murder in the first degree shall suffer death or confinement

19

in the State prison for life at the discretion of the jury.

20

And then they are told they have to indicate in their verdict

21

22

What it is basically, it is that the'jury is

6

told that a life sentence means that he may be paroled at some

8

time, but it is up to the adult authority to determine — that

9

is a separate agency in California — to determine when, if ever

10

he is released.
And in general, you are not supposed to be concerned

11
12

about that anyhow.

your job properly.

That is the gist of it, that he can be

paroled but that this shouldn’t enter into your considerations

as jurors.

We submit that the California procedure and I think
it is basically the same on this element of lack of standards,

in capital cases, and it is easy to say that the Legislature

20
21

passed the buck, that it didn’t want to decide the hard question
of who should be executed and who shouldn't be.
But I don’t think that was the basis for it.

the basis for it was in the experience of all of us who know
anything about capital cases that it is impossible, at least I
think it is impossible, to set out in advance those

identification of your procedure on this point with that of

It can be done simply because the

judge in his judgment, again with no more standards than the
jury had to start with, thinks that a life sentence should be
imposed„
In addition, there is still a further review and I
think it is important to make sura that there is no, this is
not an arbitrary decision passed in a vacuum or something.

back to this basic idea, it seems to me it is based on two
things.

One is the, as I have said it is so difficult to

formulate in advance these considerations, and the result is
that a case comes along where everybody involved feels that
the death sentence should not be posed, but it may not fall
within some predetermined category.
Q

*-•*

When you get into things like pity and sympathy

and kindness and compassion, how you can reduce that to any kind
of a standard in the due process sense of the statute defining
58

1

conduct, I don’t understand and the petitioners haven't told us.
Again, in California, for example, the jury is told

2
3

in the guilt phase of a case -- this is true of any case -— you

4

can’t take into account any pity or sympathy you might feel

5

0

7

for this defendant no matter how down and out he is, you have
\
to decide the facts. Is he guilty of murder, whatever it might
be, robbery, and you have to put pity and sympathy out of your

/

3
9
10
11
12
13

14

IS
IS

mind.
Wow if you are trying a capital case and they are
given that instruction in the guilt phase, then you have to
correct that impression in the penalty phase, because they can
properly be guided by such things in determining penalty, in
sentencing, just like a trial judge can be, take consideration
or take these things into consideration and unless it is the
position of the appellant petitioner here that pity and kindness
and compassion should be excluded from the sentencing process
and must indeed be excluded as a matter of constitutional law,

17

then it seems to me that he can’t prevail.
18
19

The model code certainly says nothing as I recall
about kindness or compassion.

No State to my knowledge has

20

ever enacted standards of the kind that are suggested here.
21

The ones in the Model Penal Code have been around for some time.
22
They have never been, adopted by anybody.
23

This discretionary sentencing in capital cases has
24

been with us as I pointed earlier, it was at the instance of
25

59

j

this Court some 70 years ago that the Federal Courts commenced

2

this procedure.
We have known about it.

3

We haven't been offended by

4

it.

5

undoubtedly there are always arguable cases, but no court has

6

ever held that this is a constitutional defect in sentencing.
Only two years ago this Court agreed to adhere to the

7

8

9
10

31
12
13

decision, in Williams against New York which in evaluating the
sentencing procedure in New York in a capital case, permitted
the trial judge to consider matters in the probationary report
and in other sources, and to consider things that had not been
testified to in open court so that in effect the defendant had
no right to cross-examine.
The witnesses that, and the information sources of

14
15

IQ
17
18
19

20

information that the trial judge considered, and in that case
the trial judge in the face of a recommendation of a life
sentence by the jury, after reviewing these matters, that came
to him not from the witness stand but

23

standards as far as I can tell and this Court affirmed it.
Two years ago in Patterson, Specht against Patterson,
you said you had given it some thought that you ssculld adhere
to that decision in Williams against New York.
It seems to me that the issues are different in this

24
25

by way of report, imposed

the death sentence in his good judgment, again without any

21

22

The results have been by and large pretty good with

case.

But that the sentencing procedure in Arkansas and the
60

1

sentencing procedure in California and in the Federal Courts

2

and everywhere in the United States, as far as 1 know, that

3

this aspect of the sentencing procedure does comport with due

4

process of law and with equal protection of the laws.
There is no problem here in my judgment of undue

S
S

vagueness in the law, although granted there are no standards

7

specifically set forth, but the definition of the crimes that

a

call for capital punishment everywhere is very specific.
It certainly is in Arkansas and it is in California.

9
10

And those crimes are set forth wherever they might be, murder

11

in the first degree, rape, however the Legislature wants to

12

apply it.

13

And the fact that the defendant doesn't know and

14

indeed no one knows and no one in this room knows, whether

15

IS
17
13
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

if he undertakes a murder in the first degree a jury will
ultimately return a death sentence or life sentence, is one
of those risks that he has to take in his life.
He doesn’t know if the Governor will grant him
clemency, he doesn't know if the District Attorney in whatever
county he happens to be in throughout the United States will
ask for a death sentence.

He doesn't even know what the higher

c ourts may rule in some things that may happen to him in the
course of his procedure.

Of course he doesn't know these.

But he knows this, if he commits a murder in the first,
degree, he is subject to the death penalty.
61

Now giving the jury the discretion to return a life

1

2

sentence was the humanitarian step.

3

determination of guilt before we ever get around to sentencing,

S

the defendant has the benefit of all of the constitutional

They all have the same opportunity.

We

In fact, they

even have a better opportunity to seek a life sentence under
the discretionary procedure than they would under any of these
conceivable standards.
Here the whole thing is wide open.

Anything that a

defense attorney can conceive of to say that might persuade a
juror, mind you you

need a unanimous verdict, if you can con­

vince one juror that there should be a life sentence, why he
has accomplished the purpose.

And the only bounds are his

own imagination, hiw own ingenuity.
I don’t think any standards are going to limit that.
There is another point here, too, I think, and I
forget to mention it in our discussion earlier about the
California procedure, that it is clear in California that the
62

s

trial judge can on request advise the jury about factors that,

they might consider.

these were not controlling in any sense, but if that were done,

there would certainly be — I think the jury could be told of

forth into account.

And reference is made to the Model Penal

It would have to be made very clear to the jury that

So, we submit that the mere absence of standards does
not in any way make the Arkansas procedure for that reason

11

share with Arkansas in terms of procedure, why I am sure the

22

Attorney General from Arkansas is prepared to deal with those.

13

If there are other objections that we don’t

I have just one closing remark and that is I think

14

that in light of your decision in Witherspoon, wherein you

15

recognised that under Illinois law the conscience of the

IS

community was focused on this man and what he had done and

17

there was no guide given to the jury, and you insisted that that

13

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

jury should be fairly composed, and there was some dispute
about whether that one was, but nevertheless it would be fairly
composed to reflect the conscience of the community.
That rule in Illinois in the absence of standards
is essentially the same thing that you have to face in Arkansas
and the same thing that we have in California.
And it seems to me that having recognised that, and
making sure as you have made sure that the jury must be a fair
63

1

representation of the community because you are invoking their

2

conscience, invoking the qualities as 1 referred to, the kind­

3

ness, compassion, not simply an arid determination of facts,

4

but a real judgment, not in the legal sense, but in the general

S

sense, a judgment of what should be done with the person.

procedure sort of reverse from some of these others.
In California theirs is the ultimate.

14

jury has before them is the evidence and the definition of the

16

e lements of larceny and they can set that punishment at any
point in that extent of time that they want to.
The prosecutor gets up there and argues that

to have 21 years.

23
24
25

The defense gets up and argues that he ought

to get the minimum sentence.

And the jury then sets it some­

where inbetween that.
It appears from my reading of the Federal statutes

21

22

he ought

thattheir procedure in death sentences is

the same as

it is in

Arkansas, that they have a unitary jury, one jury, and that
they bring in the verdict of guilt and fix the punishment at the
same time.
73

1

So it appears to us that the Arkansas statutes are

2

stricken down by this Court that the Federal rule would also

3

fall with it.

In this case in the transcript, going back to the

5

Witherspoon argument that the jury is the conscience of the

6

community, and that is sort of a standard, the Court's instruc­

7

tion No, 2 on page 380 of this transcript, he among other

8

things tells him that in reaching your verdict exercise your

When the State proved that this person intruded ■—

4

when the State proved that Maxwell entered into his victim's

15

home, beat her up, drug her across the street and attacked her

16

in a vacant lot, then the State proved a case for death and the

17

only way he can get anything less is for the jury to exercise

13

mercy which it declined to do under the facts of this case.

9

Q

Forgive me for raising this.

It may not be

20

correctly relevant, but I always have difficulty when counsel

21

refer to the jury as reflecting the conscience of the community.

22

Now, particularly in these penalty matters might very

23

well be that if you took a vote in the community the prevailing

24

sentiment would be to lynch him or hang him or electrocute him,

25

or Lord knows what.
74

1

But that the material that is there before the jury

2

might indicate to a reasonable man who is a human being that

3

some other consequence ought to be attached and one of the

4

fundamental, perhaps it is philosophical rather than strictly

5

legal, one of the fundamental questions that all of this raises

6

is what is a juror supposed to do.

1

I had thought that a juror was supposed to bring the

3

bear upon the material before him as comprehended by his senses,

9

his qualities as a human being subject to the law and the

10

standards, if any, that were given him, rather than to reflect

1?

on what might be a community attitude towards rape or murder

12

or this particular felony,

33
14
15
16

17
18
19

21

22
23

A

Well, of course, I think that the jury -- I don’t

know whether this answers your question or not — but I don’t
think the jury can leave its conscience outside of the jury box.
I think they take everything, their biases or prejudices -Q

Now, it is their conscience they bring, not the

conscience necessarily, the conscience in the sense of the
reaction grossly of the people at large who don’t have before
them what the juror is supposed to have before him.

And that

is, as I was trying to suggest, perhaps not very articulately
related to the question that is being argued here, namely the
question as to whether in bringing to bear his own conscience
his own qualities as a human being, his own comprehension upon
the material before him, if that is a juror’s function rather
75

■i
e,

than just, to reflect the gross reaction of the community.

z

The juror must as a matter of constitutional principle

3

have the guidance of some standards in at least a philosophical

4

sense that may be lie perhaps close to the heart of the issue

3

in this case.
A

6

Of course, we think that the standard is set in

7

the statute and we don’t see how you could draft a set of

3

standards that would tell the jury what to do in each particular

3

case.

1 think the Legislature, to adopt standards, would have

10

to be in session all the time and enact almost ex post facto

11

law to cover every situation.
That is what our argument is.

12

The only thing that

you — we don’t think whether you use a weapon or whatever you

14

do makes any difference.

15

the jury, that that is the standard that they are going to go

16

by is the evidence that is presented in the case.

We think that the evidence before

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM:

22

I would like to address three things if I may in

23
24
25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

rebuttal.
One, the substantive arguments for the States of
76

1

California and Arkansas only very briefly *

2

Two, the Witherspoon question in this case.

3

Three, the point brought up by California as to the

4

difference between California and Arkansas procedure and the

5

relevance of that for disposition of this matter.
My response on the substantive level can be, I think,

6
7

very brief.
As I understand both California and Arkansas admit

3
9

10
11
12

that we have got an arbitrary procedure going here and they
defend it simply on the grounds that it is necessary, that you
can’t do anything else, whether it is beneficial to the
defendant.
Both in reading the brief and in hearing the oral

13
14
13
16

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

argument, I was struck that 1 had heard this argument somewhere
before.

And so I looked around,

I find that indeed I have.

The argument that you have to allow arbitrary dis­
cretion so as to individualize on the facts of each individual
case was originally written by William Paley in 1785.

He ivas

defending the English Bloody Code under which 250 crimes were
capital, and he defended on the ground that you couldn’t get a
narrower formulation.

There was just no way in which you could

cut down on some of those crimes by fixing standards, taking
some of them out of being capital.
He said, :’The preference for the English system of
having a broad net in which you can make capital punishment
77

3

available and then let the executivecommute, was in the con­

2

sideration that the selection of - proper objects for capital

3

punishment depends principally upon circumstances which

4

however easy to perceive in each particular case after the crime

5

is committed, it is impossible to enumerate or define before­

<3

hand."

7

And so on.
And he concluded eventually that the law of England

3

was based on the wise policy of sweeping into the net every

9

crime which under any possible circumstance may merit the

to

punishment of desath and then letting individual circumstances

11

ferret it out.

12

this design furnish a just excuse for the multiplicity of

13

capital offenses which the laws of England are accused of

14

creating beyond those of other countries, thus the Bloody Code

15

was justified.

He concluded that the wisdom and humanity of

Q

How many capital crimes were there?

A

About 250, your Honor.

13

Q

What year was that?

10

A

He wrote in 1785 originally.

1G
'17

20
21
22

23
24
25

Of course the way

England did go about it was they simply cut back more and more.
They first of all removed the death penalty for
stealing from bleaching grounds and then for pickpocketing
and then for taking threepence and what have you.

Until they

got it down eventually to murder.
Then in 1957 notwithstanding the Royal Commission’s
78

I

recommendation which California cites in its brief, saying it

2

was very difficult to get down any narrower as a matter of

*3

categories, the English went ahead again in 1957 in delimited

4

capital punishment by category.

5

Now the only other thing I think I need answer —

S

Q

1

A

It was done by Parliament.

8

Q

By the Parliament.

9

A

That is correct.

10

Was that done by Parliament or with the Court?

The only other thing I need answer to the

suggestion

n

that the arbitrary discretion is justified by necessity or

12

beneficence is that it makes an awful difference who you are

13

beneficent to.

14

get a better shake.

15

and it makes a difference whether it is a white or black

10

defendant that you are talking about in terms of whether this is

17

a good or bad system.

18

It might well be that a few defendants might
A lot of them would get more even justice

In any event, I want to emphasize that our argument

19

does not take discretion, compassion or anything else out of

20

the system.

21

when he spoke about the next question or the next case.

That is what Mr. Justice Fortas was talking about

22

The question is whether standards can be devised which

23

we compassion in but narrow the range or discretion beyond where

24

Arkansas allows.

25

Our contention here is that Arkansas has thrown the
79

1

net too broadly in dealing with the discretion too little.

z

We do not contend for mandatory categories which throw out

3

wisdom and pity and compassion.

4

of law that limits the application of the death penalty much

5

more narrower than Arkansas does.
The second thing I want to address myself to is

6
7
8

9

Witherspoon.

12
13
14
15
16
17
10
19

20
21

I hope that in looking at the transcript of the

v oir dire in this case this Court will remember a number of
things.
First* Witherspoon has been generally cut to ribbons

10

11

We simply contend for a rule

by the courts below* and I don't think the court can lightly
assume ——
Q

By the courts below?

A

Arkansas* your Honor.

By every lower court that

I have seen decide a Witherspoon case since Witherspoon.

There

«

are a dozen of them pending on certiorari here.
The kind of cutting of ribbons I am talking about is
that the lower courts have eased up on the kind of opposition
to the death penalty that permits exclusion.
Secondly* they have authorized exclusion where
questions were asked which is a pretty good Witherspoon question
if the answer is equivalent.

And they authorize exclusion.

22

Three* they reprint Witherspoon records as though they
23

were done in light of Witherspoon.

Assume the juror is saying

24

something that meets the Witherspoon test and
25
80

go ahead and let

i

him set.

2

Four,, a number of courts have held that if only a

3

couple of jurors are thrown off on Witherspoon it doesn’t make

4

it bad, as only a couple.
Five, the courts have held that if the prosecutor’s

5
8

remaining peremptory challenges exceed the number of jurors in

7

question, that that sentence doesn’t get vacated under

3

Witherspoon.
Now I raise all this for this reason.

9

This case has

10

never had a Witherspoon claim in it.

The habeas petition was

11

filed prior to Witherspoon.

12

since this is a second Federal habeas corpus petition asked,

13

whether there were other issues in the case and Witherspoon was

14

never put in here.

The District Court specifically,

And the court said -- now I am going to be very weary

IS
18

about, weary not wary, about entertaining a third one — I

17

simply wouldn’t assume that this case is going to be settled

18

or that Maxwell is going to stay alive for vindication of some

19

Witherspoon claim and again I am worried about the Witherspoon—

20

claim on this record, in terms, unless this court sets right all

21

of the developments of post Witherspoon law which it made a

22

very limited ruling indeed out of Witherspoon.
More than that, Maxwell has been on death row in

Arkansas since 1962.

2

Mr. Justice White of this Court,

2

What a lot of courts are doing in light of Witherspoon

3

is they say we vacate the death sentence and. give him a new

4

trials new penalty trial now to determine whether he should

5

live or die.

5

It would be an inhumanity second only to killing this

7

man not to resolve the issue now finally presented, whether the

3

State of Arkansas has any right to be trying this man for his

3

life under the unconstitutional procedures that we are challengi :ic
Q

«0

Suppose you have contemplated the possibility

11

that the prescription of standards may result in more and not

12

fewer death penalties.

25

Have you got a reaction to that,

it.

I think I have two reactions to it.

One, I doubt

It depends on what standards they are, and two, it assumes

that our argument is an argument for mandatory categories which
would take compassion out of the system.
Q

That is not what I had in mind.

But necessarily,

there is a possibility in a way and men may reasonably differ
as to how important it is, that prescribing standards for the
imposition of the death penalty may result in more death
penalties than would come about, if the juries were just left
free to do what they choose.
And I assume you have considered that and that you
have concluded that it is not really relevant to the legal
82

J

argument that you make»

There are to the best of my knowledge 475 men on

I have, your Honor, and I will add this.

death row at this moment in the country; 470 of them were

3

sentenced by juries exercising discretion kin to or in some

Q

way like Arkansas®.
The decision in this case which we ask for would

7
S
9

vacate or lay the ground for vacating a number of death sent ences we contend are unconstitutional»
The Governor of Arkansas has 14 men on death row whose

10

11

executions he has held up pending disposition of this case.

12

This Court has before it petitions for certiorari from Alabama,

13

from New Jersey, from North Carolina, California raising this

14

issue.

15
16

17
18

19

I am very sensitive to the notion that this Court
should not decide constitutional questions prematurely but if
imminent death of dozens of people can make an issue not pre­
mature, the issues presented here are not premature.
There is no question of no adversity.

There is enough

20

adversity in this case to float a dozen constitutional issues.

21

There is no question here of a nonfocused nature of the issues.

22

The issues are clearly focused and the question is presented

23

for decision.

24
25

We suggest that for this court to put off on specu­
lation of Witherspoon or something else, the contention between
S3

i

these parties, Arkansas contending they have a right to try

2

William L. Maxwell and kill him without standards, and

3

are contending that for the better part of six years he has

4

been on death row for longer than that under jeopardy of death,

3

under an unconstitutional regime, that is the issue we put to

6

this court, we ask this court to decide.

1

The Arkansas procedure is unconstitutional for

3

violation of the rule of law and we hope that it will reach

d

and decide the issue in this case.

Thank you.
