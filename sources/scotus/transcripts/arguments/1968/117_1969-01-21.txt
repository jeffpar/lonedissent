ORAL ARGUMENT OF GER'RIT H. WORMHOUDT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. WORMHOUDT:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
This action was commenced in the United District

10
.

11

for the Court of Kansas also as a class suit under the

12

newly amended rule ^appointed three of the Federal Rules of

13

Civil Procedure.

The plaintiff bring

himself and 18,000 other consumers of natural

16

from the petitioner in this case who is a public utility,

a' Missouri Corporation, qualified to do business in Kansas.
The petitioner complains that the ~~

I beg your

19

pardon —- the respondent claims that the petitioner in this

20

case illegally exacted from the plaintiff and from the members

21

of the class which the plaintiff seeks to represent, an

22

|

illegally imposed franchise charge exacted by the city of

23

Kansas City, this charge was not maintainable beyond the

24

city limits, that respondent in this case resides beyond the

25

city limits, along with 18,000 other members of his class.

an affidavit indicating that during the probable time period

5

involved here, this particular respondent's claim would have

6

amounted $7.81.

The motion to dismiss was supported by

During the course of argument, counsel for the

respondent, frankly, stipulated that the respondent's claim
could not equal $1 ,

and that they had no knowledge of any

10

other member of the class whose; claim would equal or exceed

11

$1 ,

.

The District Court, however, overruled the motion

12

13

to dismiss. It did, in its order, make the

necessary determina-j

14

tion

IS

Court of Appeals for the 1 th Circuit for an interlockatory

16

appeal.

...

and bindings permitting petitioner to apply to the

(

That application was granted and the 1 th Circuit

18

Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court

19

at approximately the same time, within a month or two, of the
.........................................................................

affirmation of the District Court's ruling in Snyder versus

Harris.

22

I
1 would like to address myself to what I think has

23

been raised in the brief of the respondent.

24

suggested that the petitioner in this case is seeking to

25

confine the construction of the amendments to the rules to
3

It has been

1

the language of the former rule, that is, Rule 23.
The references to true class actions,hybrid class

2
3

actions, and spurious class actions.
I think it is perfectly clear that the real

4

5

problem involved here is net one of construction of prior

6

Ruler 23.

7

to do with

e

find it unnecessary to refer to it.

So far as we are concerned that rule has nothing
the present action.

We don't rely on it.

We
j

9
10

We do think that jurisdictional standards, first as

j
adopted by Congress and the body of case law which has developed

11

around

those jurisdictional standards is one set of rules

.12

and one body of law.
The rule of practice adopted by this Court from

13
14
15

time to time for itself and for the District Courts have to
do with an entirely different set of proceedingsj an entirely

16

different set of standards are involved under those

17

circumstances.

j

There are many, many cases, of course, that are
Federal Courts every day where-jurisdictional amount j

is not involved:

Fair Labor cases? I think some cases under
I

the Securities Act; Civil Rights cases and others.
Under those circumstances the District Courts need
not be bothered with the $10,000 jurisdictional amount as
they are in ordinary diversity and in ordinary Federal
question cases.
4

1

In those cases, I trust, as well as in the

2

diversity and the Federal question cases, the amendments to

3

Rule 23, will make class actions easier to handle, easier

4

to process, easier to understand the results.

5

Simply because we now have before us an attempt to

6

improve former Rule 23, .it seems to me,

7

to do with that pre-existing body of law which deals with

8

jurisdiction, which has developed through decisions of this

9

Court, since 1789, and which has always been a problem or

has nothing whatsoever

10

a matter that any complainant in Federal Court must meet

11

regardless of

12

prevailed in that

13

vhat the rules of practice are, which have
court from time to time.

I would call the Court's attention to the opinion of

14

Mr. Justice Story in the Alexander case which was well over

15

100 years old, so far as I know, that is one of the first

16

cases dealing with the jurisdictional questions and the

17

matter of aggregation.

<

18

19

The Court pointed out in that case, that, although
Congress had authorized ceiling to bring, in effect, class

..........................................................1
20

actions, or joint suits

or unpaid wages in the Federal

21

District Courts, that because this Court, at that time, had

22

an appellate jurisdiction limit of $500 as the matter in

23

controversy or the amount in controversy, therefore, there

24

was no appellate jurisdiction of any seaman's wages when

25

those wages did not amount to in excess of $500.

!
j

1

So far as I know there has been an unbroken string

2

of decisions following that case and applying it both to the

3

appellate jurisdiction of this Court and to the jurisdiction

4

of Federal Court,

5

Q

I haven’t read

that opinion but it seems to

6

have to do 'with appellate jurisdiction rather than diversity

7

jurisdiction, the language, as quoted in your brief, at least,

0

A

0

is identical, however,

10

Q

11

That is correct,

It seems to me the principle

It didn't directly have to do with diversity

jurisdiction?

12

A

No, Your Honor, it did not.

13

Q

So, it was in admiralty,

14

A

That is correct,

IS

I would point out that there are numerous situations

IS

where a class action was appropriate under the old rules and

17

will be just as appropriate under the new

18

rules,

I do think it may be some help in analyzing the

IS

question,to really ask what do we mean when we use the term

20

"aggregation"?

21

22
23
24
25

I think it was Judge Frankie mentioned in an article
in our brief,who

suggested that the term"aggregation" has

probably been a complete misnomer from the beginning.

His

analysis may have some bearing on the question put by Mr,
Justice Fortas earlier.
6

Since, as he points out in a traditional class

1
2

action where the claim is common or undivided or joint.

3

effect you have but a single claim.

4

may be interested in it, claims are not being aggregated, where

3

the claim, itself, is joint or common or undivided.

6
7

In those cases, where the total claim,itself, has any |
j
derivative suit in excess of $10,000, there really is not an
j

8

aggregation or a joinder of plans.

In

While numerous people

The jurisdictional problem simply doesn*t exist,

9

Q

10

What is your view of the case where a single

11

stockholder sues on behalf of, although they are similarly

12

situated, and he had admittedly more than a $10,000 claim.
A

13
■\

14

|

■

i

Is he bringing this on behalf of the stockholders

■■

or the corporation, Your Honor?
I

15

Q

On behalf of the stockholders.

16

A

Well, he, himself, has a claim in excess of

17

the jurisdictional amount — I do not know of any decisions

18

of this Court which say, under those circumstances, he could

19

then, if this were simply a joinder device, include all the

i
I

20

other members of the class unless their claims also exceeded.

21

22

I think in Clark against Paul Grey, and I am
sorry I am not more conversant with that case, where this

23

Court, on its own motion, dismissed several claims.

24
25

As I recall, the plaintiff, in that case, had the
requisite jurisdictional, and this Court directed, however,
7

i

1

that the other parties to the action be dismissed from the

2

suit.

Q

3

A

This is my recollection of it.
Of course, you do not need to go that far to

win your lawsuit, do you?

5

A

No, Your Honor, I don't.

6

Q

So far as you know, nobody here has a claim of

7

as much as $10,000.
A

8
9

I think it is inconceivable that any of them

would.

10

I point out that neither the District Court nor the

11

Appellate Court characterised this as a B-l, B-2 or B-3 class

12

action.

13

Q

You would say,then,that the only judgment

14

the Court can render here — let's assume that it got over the

15

jurisdictional amount hurdle — the only judgment the

16

Court could render here would be based on the claims of the

17

individual plaintiffs?

18

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, I am — I assume separate

19

decrees would have to be entered in each case — I mean as

20

to each party, defining the

21

ing he had paid his gas bill at the time and there weren't

22

any set-offs.

23
24
25

Q

exact amount that he had, assum­

You don't think the purpose of the amendment

to the rtiles was to overcome precisely that situation.
A

Not, Your Honor, in diversity suits.

8

I submit

l

1

it was not.

2
3

I think the main thrust of my argument would he
along these lines.

4
5

Rule 82 says the rule shall not be construed to
extend or limit jurisdictional --

6
7

Q

It doesn’t really matter whether it is diversity

or not; suppose, somehow or other, that the jurisdictional
i

t
8

amount were not available.

You just think that this is not
i

9

a proper class action.

I
I
.

A

10

No, Mr. Justice, I think it may be a proper

11

class action as a class action is now defined.

12

that that doesn’t tell you whether or not you have jurisdiction.
Q

13

I simply submit

Does it have any bearing on how much can be

14

recovered ultimately? what the judgment can be?

15

limited to the individual plaintiffs who have joined?
A

16
17

IS
19
20
21

22

25

I think it depends not on the total aiPOUnt

of the aggregate judgment, but on the nature of the claim of
the plaintiff, himself, and of the claim of the class.
I would like to refer, very briefly, to Rule 82, whiclj
j
says that the rules,and this rule was also amended in 1966,
I
shall not be construed.* to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction
of the Federal Courts.
The Circuit Court conceded, in its opinion, and I

23
24

Is the judgment

think

counsel will concede here, this

action simply was not

maintainable prior to the amendment of the rule.
9

1

That being so, although I may be too closely geared

2

to logic, if the action could not have been maintained for

3

jurisdictional reasons prior to the amendment of the rule, but

4

itmay now be maintained because of the amendment of the rule,

5

then, it seems to me, that is only because of a construction

6

which does enlarge the jurisdiction of the Federal District

7
