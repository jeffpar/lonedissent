ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARSHALL PATNER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

8
9

MR. PATNER:

Counsel are present.
Mr. Patner.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court,

this case, the failure to arrest hecklers, resulted in the

W

suppression of free speech, where demonstrators were peaceful,

11

where the hecklers threatened and attacked them in the near

12

presence of the police.

13

New, the defendant and between 65 and 70 or 80 other

14

people, in August 1965, conducted a protest march by beginning

IS

in Chicago's Buckingham Fountain, then went to City Hall and

16

paraded there, and then marched to the area in which the Mayor

17

of the City of Chicago lives called Bridgeport,, some five or

18

eight miles from the Loop, down in that area.

19

When they arrived there were approximately 35 people in

20

the neighborhood, on the street.

21

evening, but when they first arrived they sang some songs,

22

they chanted, made several remarks.

23

the time theey started at Buckingham Fountain,

24

the Mayor's community, to march and proceed with the same kinds

25

of remarks, the same kinds of singing and chanting, under the
3-

-

They marched silently in the

They were permitted, from
to City Hall, to

i

eyes of the local police and with the accompaniment of the

z

Corporation Counsel of the City of Fernwood.

3

After they had marched for some time in the Bridgeport

4

community,

5

Dick Gregory, who took charge of this march of this group,

6

agreed to the request of the commander that after 8:20 p.m.

7

there would be no singing and no chanting.

e

there was no conversation whatsoever by the marchers directed

9

toward the spectators.

a request from the police commander on the scene

After that time

The only sound whatsoever made --

10

except for walking -- was communication by Gregory to the

11

people,

12

them to stay in line,

S3

they should march, and they did so.

14

sidewalk except when interrupted by local people who put hoses

15

in their way so to remove them.

one got in their way, a policeman asked them to get out of the

17

way, and they did so.

They stayed on the public

They did so and stopped when

When a counter march started,

in order not to join it,

19

they changed directions for a block or so.

Now-, while their

20

conduct continued to be peaceful, a crowd began to gather and

2!

the crescendo grew with that crowd.

22

The hecklers, as we call them,

the local people who came

23

out, were not in any wise captives of the peaceful marchers.

24

The marchers never made any noise up to that point.

25

never sang.

They

The people chose to come out and the group grew

1

from 35 to maybe 1,200 or 1,400.

2

The subject of this demonstration involved criticism of

3

the then Superintendent of Schools of the City of Chicago

4

Miller who often was criticized for his policies on racial

5

problems in city schools, an issue of public interest»

6

Now, what is missing from the opinion below concerning a

1

jury conviction of disorderly conduct on two counts are the

8

followings

9

by the peaceful marchers, sometimes called provocation.

There was no invective or invitation to violence
There

10

was no effort by the police to arrest any heckler.

11

police in this case were awfully good in trying to protect

12

the marchers.

13

teresting about this case, I think a bit unusual in these

14

demonstration cases, is there is very little dispute with tie

IS

facts as stated by the Illinois Supreme Court, very little

18

it occurred after 8:20»

They were very good at that.

And what is in­

They did

It did not occur after 8:20.

The only other factual dispute we have with the city,

«9
20

they said there was a task force that was specially trained

21

to go out and deal with these kinds of things.

22

in their brief but page 33 of the appendix -- that is refer­

23

ring to page 33 of the appendix, it is page 103 of the record

24

-- the police testified that they had no special training at

25

all.

They say so

Except for that ~~ this is not a case that involves

any dispute with the press.

in attempting to protect the marchers as they went around the

Mayor's house.

And the police did a splendid job

12

a white community.

13

fair to say that it was at least in part to bring the problem

City Hall also.

20

Q

well, he was at City Hall, was he?

21

A

That does not appear in the record.

That is usually

22

where he is during business hours.

23

they did not get to Bridgeport until after normal hours at

24

City Hall were closed.

25

Q

This is later.

However,

Ik there any city ordinance in Chicago that makes a

~

\

1

distinction with respect to parades and demonstrafcions in resi­

2

dential areas as compared with business areas or other types of

3

areas?

4

A

Subsequent to this case, Your Honor, the Illinois

S

legislature saw fit. to pass a statute.

At the time of this

6

occurrence there was neither an ordinance or a statute.

7

Q

What did the statute say?

8

A

The statute is referred to in our brief, and it says

9

that under public policy, with respect to the peace and good

10

order of communities, chat there shall be no -- I am just para­

11

phrasing it -- no demonstrations in what are Known as residen-

12

tia1 neighborhoods.

13

Q

What does -- is it printed?

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

It is in our brief, and I will find the

page in a moment.

16

Q

Oh, I see.

17

A

But that occurred after the conventions and this case

and ~-

19

Q

20

22

Now there was no state law attempting a march arrange­

ment of any Kind anywhere in the city or the county?
A

Sir, they show no ordinance or statute prohibiting

residential picketing -~

23

Q

was there barring any picketing?

24

A

No, sir.

25

There was an ordinance of the City of

Chicago requiring a parade permit.
„7™

That is the only

1

Q

How was It granted?

z

A

There was no request for a permit.

3

There was no

permit in this case,
i

4

Q

How was it to be granted,, the permit?

5

A

Oh, that appears. Your Honor, in the reply brief —

6

Q

In your reply brief?

7

A

Yes, sir, in this Court

at page 6.

i

It is to be

8

granted after some of the same language that appears in many

9

of these, after first giving notice that by investigation by

iO

the police department, on the application received, it is

11

true that they have determined something about the organisation

12

requested in writing.

13

the marchers in this case were never charged with marching

14

without a parade permit.

However, no permit was rejected, and

13

Q

well, what were they charged with doing?

16

A

They were charged on two counts of disorderly conduct.

17

One of those accounts appears to be that they caused the

18

hecklers by their presence, they caused the hecklers to threater

19

them and throw rocks, eggs, bottles and to swear at them and

20

make mean comments.

21

was unlawful and apparently caused those people to congregate.

22

Those are the two counts.

And the second count was their purpose
f

23

■ *

The Illinois Supreme Court does not give us any wisdom,

24

however, on which of the accounts -- or whether it is both of

25

the counts

that they are dealing with.

They treat this as a

1

single conviction in their opinion.

2

come under a separate provision of the Illinois -- I'm sorry --

3

of ths Chicago Disorderly Conduct Ordinance 193-1.

4

Mow, those two counts

Mow, the Illinois Supreme Court found that when the

5

police commander at the scene, after the crowd' had grown to

6

about 1,400, asked the marchers to leave, and he asked them

7

about five times, and he asked them clearly and pleasantly,

3

"Your presence here will cause

And,, speaking through Mr. Gregory, they refused to

10

leave, except for three or four people who decided to accept

11

police protection and were taken through the crowds and left.

14

change was as the crowd grew they became more violent.

time -- and this has not been disputed, I think -- at no time

16

did the marchers ever make any gesture, any remark, any state­

How long were they marching before they were arrested?

At that time the conduct of the marchers had remained

hours, but somewhere over an hour in the community.
Q

They had

said they wanted to do it all night long.

23

Would your view be any different as to whether they might have

24

been -- whether they were -- as I remember, they were disbanded

23

around 10:00 o’clock or 10:30 at night?

A little earlier.

And suppose they had continued until 2:00 o'clock in

A

11

Your Honor, Mr. Justice, in this case, because the

12

marchers remained silent, the only danger of riot would have

13

been the election of the residents to come out and attack them.

15

Well, they did a certain amount of singing, didn't

Yes, sir, but I am assuming that their conduct would

Q

Q

18

They had some agreement, did they not, with the

19

police as to their conduct and what they would do and what not

20

do?

21

A

Yes, sir, they did.

22

Q

was that observed?

23

A

Yes, it was observed exactly, except for when, the

24

three instances I mentioned, when hoses ware put in their way,

25

they waited until they removed; when one neighbor or heckler
10-

1

stood in their way, police asked him to leave and he did; the

2

third, when the counter-march started and they changed their

3

direction to avoid it and they then resumed their exactly

4

original route as set out by the police.

S
6

So there was no invective or invitation to violence, as
found by the Illinois Supreme Court.

7

Q

Did you answer my question?

8

A

Oh, I'm sorry, sir,

9

Q

I’m sorry.

10

A

well, no, my answer would have been that they would

I -tough one.

have kept going because they were silent.
Q

You don't think there is any limit at all provided

13

that they don't make any noice except whatever noise may be

14

necessarily incident to the sound of feet of the marchers at

15

2:00 a.nu, in a residential area where women and children are

16

as leep?

17

A

Yes, sir, I think that is right.

At the start of

18

this case, the argument was made that ringing doorbells in a

19

community where people worked all night should be prohibited

20

to the Jehovah Witnesses, and this Court said that was not a

21

reason to stop the kind of activity that would be related to

22

night work or day work, day or night, depending on how people

23

work in their activities.

24
25

Mow, there was no effort to disperse this crowd and the
odd thing here is, as the record shows, and the Illinois Supreme
11-

-

,

1

Court declined, when people broke through and the police

2

grabbed them and threw them back into the crowd and did not

3

make arrests, they did not arrest any one of these men.

Court, uses to avoid our argument in this case, says that in

11

asked the people, the Hegro members of this audience and

18

others to take up arms and fight for their rights, to take up

Well, Mr. JusticeFortas,

Ihaveto answer the

The Supreme Court of Illinois,

ques­

the

19

highest tribunal court of the state, says that disorderly

11

conduct occurs when there are five conditions present, when

12

there is an imminent threat of violence, when the police have

13

done everything they could reasonably do to protect the

14

demonstrations, when they request the demonstrations to stop,

15

and when they explain the reasons for making the request, and

16

when the demonstrators refuse.

Not*, we contend that --

And you don't have any --

That is the way they construe this section?

21

not this section but it is the decision of the Supreme Court

22

of Illinois which interprets this section to mean those five

23

things.

might conceivably -- I don’t know whether that would be proper

or not -- might conceivably advance that as a common law

definition of a breach of the peace, if there is such a thing.

5

But, looking at this statute, it seems to me that on the basis

6

of this record it is arguable that the applicable provision is

7

the following, and the only applicable provision, that it is

8

a misdemeanor, that those persons commit a misdemeanor who

9

shall collect in bodies or crowds for any purpose to make

10

noise or disturbance of other persons.

11

that is the applicable provision there, isn't it?

It is arguable that

It is, indeed, the gist of the

Q

Now, forget, for the moment about the construction of

14

the Supreme Court of Illinois, is there -- did these people

make an improper noise, riots or disturbances, breach of the

peace, or a diversion pertaining to a breach of the peace?

17

Did they?

18

A

Wall, Your Honor --

19

Q

Are they specifically so charged?

20

A

Your Honor, yes, indeed, we charged both of these

21

sections.
Q

22

Well, would you tel] me what there is in the record

23

that supports any of those specifically provisions in the

code?

Q

You can understand the problem that I am raising, I

9

am sure.

10

A

X certainly can, Mr. Justice Fortas.

IS

Q

Because on this record it is certainly at least

12

arguable that you look at the specific provision of the language,

13

the only provision that is applicable is when that makes it a

14

crime for persons to collect in a body or a crowd to make an

IS

annoyance or a disturbance of other persons, and that --

16

A

17

Q

well —
if that were the case here, and X suppose you woulc

18

agree that that would present a very substantial constitutional

19

problem on the decisions of this court.

20

A

Only were the court not to adhere to Winters vs„ Hew

21

York, where the Court said that the construction given the

22

statute or ordinance by the highest tribunal court ©f the

23

state is as much a part as if it were specifically written in

24

and when the court said that the defendant is chargeable with

25

the subsequent judicial decision as he is by knowledge of law.

Well,

Q

Mr. Simon,

that is the issue, Mr. Justice Portas.
these five elements that you catalogued

6

in answering Justice Portas' question are those that appear on

10

Yes.

It appears on page 28 and 29 of your brief.

12

A

Yes»

Is that right?

14

A

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

15

Q

Now, was there any foreshadowing of this construction

16

of the ordinance in any previous Supreme Court of Illinois

cases?

A

Not in the narrow construction which is applied here,

no,

22

ordinance within operation and it should be construed in the

light of the facts which are charged as a violation of disorder­

How about this, case of Chicago vs. Joyce in 1967?

By foreshadowing, Mr. Justice, no.

Supreme Court, is not foreshadowed in any of the preceding

Q

You are correct in that.

You of course are on sound grounds as far as the de­

12

cisions of this court go in such cases as Winters, and in Cox

13

vs. New Hampshire, that a construction of the very case in

14

which the conviction is confirmed by the Supreme Court of

15

Illinois, is sufficient to remove the vice of vagueness from

16

the statute because of the decisions of all of these others.

17

And I wondered whether there was any foreshadowing, and you

18

tell us there was not.
