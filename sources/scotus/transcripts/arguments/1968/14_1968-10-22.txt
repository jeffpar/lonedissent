ORAL ARGUMENT OF EMANUEL HARRIS

\
\

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

\

10

MR. HARRIS:

II

The question involved on this certiorari is the effect

12

of the failure of a third arbitrator in a tripartite arbitration

13

proceeding and a party to disclose prior business relations

14

between them, whether an award made in such a proceeding is

IS

invalid under the Federal Arbitration Act.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court;
\

18

The act provides that the award may be vacated where

1?

the award was procured by corruption or fraud, where there was

18

evidence, partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or either

19

of them, or where the arbitrator is guilty of any other misbe­

20

havior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.

21

This case arises out of contact between the petitioner

22

and the respondents.

23

respondent Samford for the performance of painting work on five

24

construction projects in Puerto Rico.

25

was the general contractor.

The petitioner was a subcontractor of the

-2

The respondent Samford

1
2

The claim of petitioner was that Samford, although it

3

received payment from the owner for the work performed by the
f
petitioner,, failed to make progress payments to the petitioner

4

and, therefore, the petitioner abandoned the work.

5

Samford is that the petitioner abandoned and stopped the work

S

under contracto

The claim of

The contract provides for arbitration of all disputes,.

7
8

The respondent bonding companies were the sureties on Samford,

9

Miller Act cash bonds.

The contract, as I said, provided for the

10

arbitration of disputes and the respondent bonding companies

11

obtained a stay of the suit against them on the Miller Act bond

12

pending the determination of the arbitration,
Pursuant to the procedure established by the contracts

13
n

the petitioner and Samford each appointed one arbitrator.

w

two arbitrators appointed an arbitrator by the name of Capacete.

16

The the time the arbitrators were designated and prior to the

17

arbitration proceedings, petitioner's attorney Mr. Romero, made

18

an investigation to discover whether any of the arbitrators had

19

prior business relations with any of the parties and he found

20

none and none of the arbitrators informed him of any such prior

2?

relations.

22

Those

He states in an affidavit in the record that if he

23

had known about such private previous relations, he would as a

24

lawyer have objected to the arbitrators' capacity.

25

state throughout their briefs that no inquiry was made by the
3-

-

The responder ts

1

petitioner,, totally disregarding this affidavit by Mr. Romero,

2

although they devoted about five pages in their brief in an atte:

3

to discredit Mr» Romero's affidavit,

4

Q

Buvfc he never asked this particular arbitrator?

5

A

The affidavit does not disclose.

6
7

The affidavit says that none of the arbitrators
informed him.

8
3

Q

The affidavit does not say that he asked.

Didn't that particular arbitrator testify that nobody

asked him?

ID

A

He did.

However, it was imbedded in the respondents'

n

brief that Capacete did discuss possible arbitrators with Mr.

\z

Romero at the time a vacancy appeared in the Board of Arbitra­

ia

tors.

14

Romero, Mr. Capacete furnished a. list of lawyers who knew some­

IS

thing about engineering cases and from that list furnished by

16

Mr. Capacete a third arbitrator was designated to fill the

17

vacancy.
Nov/ Capacete at that time did not say anything about hr.

18

10

20
21

V

As a matter of fact, at that time on the request of Mr.

prior relations with Saraford.
Q

Do I gather it is your position that there is other

misbehavior under the statute?
i

22

A

No, our position is that the arbitrator and the

23

respondents with whom he had business relations were under a duty

24

to disclose these previous relationships.

25

Q

Yes, the statute you just quoted to us speaks in terras

X

1

of certain misbehavior of the arbitrator apart from the position

2

of the contractor, and any duty he may have had.

3

position that the arbitrator in any event was under an affirma­

4

tive duty or otherwise the duty of misbehavior if he did not

5

disclose these?

6
7

8
9
10

ii

1Z

A

Is it your

Wo, our position is that the very failure to make dis­

closure constitutes misbehavior to the prejudice of the petitioner.
!

Q

And this on the part of the arbitrator independently

of the other parties?
A

And also on the part of the respondent because it is

actually referring to corruption and fraud.
Q

Let me put it to you again.

Are you submitting to us

13

that without regard to the conduct or the failure of the other

14

party in the arbitration to disclose, it is misbehavior under

IS

the statute for the arbitrator not to disclose it?

16

A

Yes.

1

And we will go further and say not only was it

17

misbehavior on the part of the arbitrator, but there was a duty

18

on the part of the respondent to disclose these prior relations.

19

Q

Where did that duty come from?

20

A

It is a matter of lax* when parties submit their con­

21

troversy to an arbitration board and particularly to a tripartite

22

board, that it certainly is the duty of the respondent to disclose

23

that the third arbitrator, who is supposed to be a neutral arbi­

24

trator, is in fact not a neutral arbitrator.

25

That is within the provisions of the Arbitration Act
5

-

-

1

that the award was procured by corruption and fraud in the con­

2,

cealment of the prior relations, so it is within the statute undcjsr

3

both, provisions that I referred to,

4

Q

The First Circuit does not deny that in some circum­

5

stances there may be a duty on the part of the arbitrator to

6

make voluntary disclosures.

7

it is not clear that in this case a relationship was sufficienti',

B

close to establish partiality as a matter of law.

9

right?

10

A

That is what the Court of Appeals held,

ti

Q

In other words the Court of Appeals affirmed a factual

52

As I read it, however, it says that

Is that

determination by the District Court?

13

A

That is true,

Mr, Justice Fortas, the Court also held

14

that under the circumstances and facts in this case it would be

IS

far better if there had been disclosure.

16

ment of the respondents that the relations between these two

57

parties were remote and isolated and insignificant and insubstan ■

18

tial.

19

were remote, isolated and insubstantial, they held it would have

20

been far better if there were disclosure.

In other words, the Court didn’t hold that these relation::;

That is the whole gist of this cast that this arbitra­

21

22

That answers the argu­

tor and the respondent should have disclosed thie relation.
Now, coming back to ray discussion with reference to

23
24

inquiry-- -

2S

Q

Mr, Harris, what would happen if the arbitrator in good
-S-

1

faith forgot and later on remembered?

2
3

A

Mr, Justice Marshall, it would be impossible for this

arbitrator to forget this.

4

Q

I am talking about in a hypothetical.

5

A

In a hypothetical if the circumstances were such as

6

to justify forgetfulness, there might be some excuse or justi­

?

fication for failure to disclose, but not in this case.

8
9

Q

I just say maybe you are going too far in making

a flatrule

just

that if a neutral arbitrator has at any time under

10

any circumstances in the past had any dealings with one of them.,

n

that

12

in and of itself is sufficient to upset his decision.
A

I think you would have to go to the facts in the

S3

lar case.

14

close automatically would not disquality an arbitrator.

I can't conceive of cases where mere failure to dis­

You are not asking for automatic pro se rule, are you?

Now, in the face of that and referring to the nature

of these relations, the respondent went so far as to impose a

25

condition on the petitioner at the time the petitioner was going

By the way, these services are on the very project, some

of them involved in the arbitration, and they say these services

Capacete himself testified that he personally, using the pronoun

IS

but there is no appeal from an arbitrator on law or fact, and

ia

that is the reason why the position of the third arbitrator in

17

this case is so important, because there is no appeal from the

18

award on questions of law and fact and that is why the stricter

standard is required of the third arbitrator than the other

They have been responsible for the thousands of hours

the petitioner to the tremendous burden and expense of carrying

18

Now withstanding this failure to disclose, these rela­

tions and the attempted justification of this failure which abso­

If there is a question of the law here, I suppose there

has to be a contention that in these circumstances an arbitrator

has a duty to come forward and make disclosure whether or not he

and that even where you have a unanimous award, there is a per

15

Your Honor, with reference to the question of whether or not an

arbitrator had a duty to volunteer any alleged disqualification,

17

the cases cited by petition deal with the American Arbitration

18

Association, which is used when the parties in their arbitration

clause refer to it by reference, and the agreement becomes juris-

20

dictional.

21

Now,

We all know that an arbitrator has to have authority

22

to decide, must be vested by the agreement of the parties to be

23

bound in everything from the disputes clause in Government con­

24

tracts, the Bianchi Decision, all arbitration grows out of the

parties having consented to as a matter of contract to allow a
third person to resolve the dispute and be bound by it.

If you add all $12,000, it gets down to something like
one-tenth of 1 percent of the man's business, Mr. Capacete's

Q

The question for us really is what did the Courts

12

below find and in the truth, I think the District Court found

13

that there was no prejudice or bias, in fact, as manifested in

14

the course of the proceedings, Wo. 1; and No. 2, that they did

15

find the relationship was not sufficiently close to require an

10

arbitrator to volunteer the information?

17

A

Yes, sir, that is absolutely correct.

18

Q

Did the District Court find that?

'19

A

In fact, not only did the District Court find there was

20

no imputation of even partiality, much less fraud, but the Dis­

21

trict Court reviewed all the evidence.

22

Q

The next question is, did the District Court find that

23

the relationship v;as not sufficiently close to require the arbi­

24

trator to come forward with a disclosure?

25

A

Your Honor, the District Court held that there was no

A

That is correct, it imposes that, and in that case,

Your Honor, the arbitrator did not do it and it is significant

that the Court held that certainly a party to arbitration could

suspect that a large real estate firm like the one the arbitra­

business dealings with a business as large as Gimbals, and there

There is not one iota of proof in any officer of the

Q

Is the burden on them to prove this or is the burden

on your people to show that the arbitrator was not biased?

10

A

The burden is completely on them, Your Honor, by uni­

versal decision, the one who is attempting to set aside the

12

award.

13

Q

No matter what the secret relationship might be between

the arbitrator and your side?

The burden would be upon them to show that there, had

Do you mean by that that it is legally not here?

X am saying, Your Honor, that I believe ---

Just one or the other?

It has legally been surrendered, so there are no

grounds to object to here.

So it is not properly here?

No, sir, they have appealed and certiora has been

here, but on the merits of the issue.

the record, has so stipulated as to the integrity, the absence

of misbehavior, and we submit on the merits they have ratified

the award and the qualification of the arbitrator.

5

I believe he is correct that Mr. Romero knew Mr. Capacete so

well that he accepted him, he and his client, as arbitrator,

actually came into this Court and repeated and stipulated those

very things.

Do you feel there is any difference in the standards

that ought to apply to any of these arguments?
A

Your Honor, the majority rule is that all three are

17

standing on the same footing, New York departed from that and

said they recognize the functional reality that either party,

the one they appoint is more partial and the third one is the

20

one that is more neutral.

that of selecting a jury.

5

7

Q

Nov/ the law,

Your argument is the same standards apply to all three

arbitrators when they are appointed as they were here?
A

Yes, sir.

In this instance that the party had an abso

8

lute right to make inquiry and if there was some disqualifying

9

relationships, they could object and as a matter of fact go into

10

equity court and ask that the arbitration be stayed and the

11

arbitrator removed and the one party be compelled to allow anothi

n

one to serve.
That would not have been necessary at all.

IS

The corres

pondence reveals we were trying to get someone.
Q

Am I correct in recalling that Mr. Romero was asked at

16

some point in this hearing what he would have done, had he known

17

of Capacete's connection with the subcontractor?

18

A

Yes, sir, you are correct.

19

Q

What was his answer?

His answer was that he would not have objected or

probably would not, but he would have given his client the infor­
