ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. CLAIBORNE;

7

e

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.

9

When the court rose yesterday I had just summarised

10

the three respects in which now view Gaston County has failed

11

in its proof of showing that the application of the literacy

12

test in that jurisdiction had not had either purpose or effect

13

of discriminating against the Negro franchise.

14

Those were first failure to shov/ that with respect

15

to municipal elections carried on within the territory of the

16

county discrimination had not occurred within the preceding

17

five years.

18

Second, a failure to rebut, if a rebuttal was

19

possible, the inference of discrimination that arises from the

20

fact that white illiterates were registered and the literacy

21

22
23
24
25

test waived as to them whereas the same was not true with
respect to Negro illiterates.
Q

Wasn't there some evidence that Negro illiterates

had been registered?
A

Mr. Justice, there was but 1 think there were
31

1

nine arguably illiterate Negroes who were brought as witnesses.

2

Of those, three may have failed the test for some eye defect

3

rather than because of illiteracy.

4

rized the oath, this being under the regime of the oral test

5

that involved reading the oath, and to that extent perhaps

6

deceived the registrar that they were illiterate the remaining

7

two or three seemed to have been true illiterates whose

8

illiteracy may have been known to the registrar.

Two had apparently memo­

9

It is significant in that each of these nine 'witnesses

10

came from the Precinct 7 in Gastonia, the one area predominantly

11

Negro where the policy of the county authorities seemed to have

12

been more lenient toward Negro registration than elsewhere.

13

There was no evidence that anywhere else within the

14

jurisdiction of the county comparable waiver had taken place.
Q

15

It was in that particular precinct in the city

16

of Gastonia where a large majority of the Negroes in the county

17

lived, wasn't it?
A

18

One-third of the population of the county of

19

all races lives within that city.

20

the Negro population lives within the city of Gastonia.

21

not clear whether those figures are of record or not.

22

it is clear, however, that fully half if not considerably more

23

live in the rural areas or in other municipalities other than

24

Gastonia.

25

Q

I think less than half of

io

here somewhere that only about 13 percent of the population of
the out-of-city, out of the county population is Negro.
Is that correct?
A

That is true overall within the county.

I

think it is actually 12 percent of the population of Gastonia
County today is Negro.

At one time it seems to have been

considerably larger proportionately as today.
On the other hand, the waiver for whites was clearly
a matter of general practice throughout the county.

There

were 29 eye witnesses whose testimony was taken by deposition
but who were clearly illiterate.

Many of them had been visited

11

12

at their homes, they had made no effort to register on their
own and some, at least one notable example the applicant

13

had indicated to the registrar that he didn't want to register
14

and was registered nevertheless.
15

Most of them testified that they had informed the
16

registrar that they were illiterate and nevertheless had been
17

registered.
18

In addition to that evidence, the Government intro­
19

duced registration forms from some 70 white applicants which
20

showed the illiterate in the full sense of being unable to
21

even sign their names and the notations there which make it
22
clear the registrar signed for them are sometimes quite
23

candid, can't write is the explanation, sometimes there is an
24

"X" which is unexplained, in many instances the notation
25

33

1

excusing the applicant from signing is too nervous, in some

2

other instances the notation is left glasses at home, eye

3

glasses»

4

The Government, of course, the total here is some­

5

thing like 100.

6

from this number, who were willing to testify or whose illit­

7

eracy was evident from their inability to even sign their

6

names, that the practice was quite prevalent and, of course,

9

in no sense limited to this number that would be found as

10

The Government, I think reasonably infers

willing witnesses»
Finally we think Gaston County has failed in its

11
12

proof by failing to rebut the natural inference resulting from

13

the educational disparity, the lack of equal educational

14

opportunity afforded Negro voters of today when they were

15

school children that the literacy test has borne more heavily

16

on them and has continued to do so.
I want to make clear that in our view either of

17

18

the first two grounds is sufficient to support the judgment

19

denying exemption to Gaston County.
On the other hand, I propose to focus on the third

20
21

ground.

The reason for that is in part that the failure

22

with respect to proof or concerning municipal elections was

23

sufficient ground does seem to us to be a somewhat tentative

24

one, a little like the tail wagging the dog.

25

It does not come to the heart of the policy of the
34

1

2

Voting Rights Act.
The second ground while again quite sufficient does

3

have a somewhat punitive character in that if in the past three

4

years Negro illiterates have been afforded full opportunity

5

to come on the rolls it may be that the registration of white

6

illiterates has in that sense been cured and that the dis­

7

crimination has in a real sense been largely eliminated.

25

That is not the test under the Act.

Under the Act

so long as there has been discrimination within the prior five
years Gaston County would have to wait another two years.

But

still it seems to us to get more to the central issue to focus
on the ground which is the ground that the District court,
the majority of the District Court thought the soundest on
which to base its judgment.
It is, of course, also a ground which presents a
question of recurring importance which sooner or later will
have to come before the court in this case or another.

It

also has a different consequence.
This bears on my somewhat inadequate answer to
Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday.

Under the Act after the five

years are up and jurisdiction means exemption, there is an
additional five-year period during which the jurisdiction of
the District Court is retained and the court is instructed
to entertain an application by the Attorney General during
that period under the same standards as would have applied
35

1

during the previous five years.

2

And if the effect of the disparity with respect to

3

education were continuing in the second five-year period there

4

would then be a justification for a suit of that kind and that

5

probability seems likely only with respect to this third

6

ground„

7
8

9

So that the basis of the judgment may have a very
important practical impact.
Finally, this third ground looks in one sense to

10

past, that is the educational disparity but on the other hand

11

it quite realistically looks to the future, unlike either of

12

the prior two grounds.

13

In this sense what is being tested here is whether

14

the discrimination of the past still has a lingering effect

15

and will in years to come,

16

educational disparity has

17

because it will continue to have for some time to come, it

18

seems to us that this basis for the judgment is the one that

19

ought to be focused upon.

20
21
22

23
24
25

For that reason, not because the
had a discriminatory effect but

It seems to us also that this ground of decision is
faithful to the legislative intent.

We must remember that

at the time the suspension of tests was proposed in the
Congress the argument ran that that was an unnecessary radical
procedure, that it was quite sufficient if the complaint were
that illiterates, white illiterates, had been registered and
36

1

that same privilege had been denied Negroes.
The way to cure that is to require or at least offer

2
3

the States the alternative of a complete re-registration.

The

4

answer made to that suggestion by the Attorney General repro­

5

duced in both committee reports is that that would not have

6

solved the problem because the reinstitution of the literacy

7

test would bear more heavily on the Negro voters precisely

8

because they had been denied the same educational opportunities,
So we are dealing here with a ground of decision

9
10

which the Congress itself focused on.

11

Justice Stewart pointed out yesterday that the result of this

12

argument is one that the Congress apparently did not fully

13

appreciate at the time.
But there are several things that ought to be said

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

about that.

24
25

First, the Act as I think I pointed out yesterday

does not deal merely with literacy tests, it also suspends
other tests which have nothing to do with educational dis­
parities and it also has other provisions with respect to
enactment of new laws, sending of Federal Examiners, Federal
observers which have nothing to do with these educational
disparities.
Also, the five-year period was in the end simply a

22
23

Now I must concede as

legislative compromise.

Congress seemed not to have quite

focused on what would happen at the end of that five-year
period.

It is rather unthinkable for instance that having

37

i

allowed thousands of illiterate Negro voters in the South to

2

become registered thanks to this Federal Act, the Congress

3

intended to permit that suddenly they should be purged from

4

the rolls after five years had gone by,
Q

5
6

i was going to ask you that.

There is just no

provision covering that possibility is there in the law?

7

A

Short of an objection, no, on this ground.

G

Q

After the termination of five years?

9

A

After the termination of five years the Act

10

itself would not —Q

11

from the rolls, is that correct?

16

19

20
21

22
23
24

Would not prevent under the re-established

tiat

That is correct.

I think what we must say is

Congress didn't look that far ahead.
Q

No.

A

It

assumed that the Act would be extended or

that the courts i^ould intervene and they did provide in this
additional five-year period

I was speaking of for the courts

to intervene when the Act otherwise expired.

And it seems to

me that that is the legislative scheme.
Now it is perfectly obvious that this literacy test
if reinstituted will bear more heavily on the Negro.

That is

true because fewer Negroes went to school at all, twice as
many Negroes never went to school in Gaston County as whites,

25

38

1

it is true because fewer of them than whites stayed long enough

2

to obtain the necessary literacy.

3

Negroes were in that position as whites, and that 30 percent

4

of the Negroes of Gaston County never got beyond the fourth

5

grade and finally they learned less when they were there.
Q

6

7

Again, almost twice as many

And finally, finally, a lower percentage of them

are registered.

57
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Well, we do say that, Mr. Justice.

we don't quite go that far.

But again

Here there is a violation of

not only Brown versus the Board but also Plessey versus
Ferguson.

Not only was the education segregated but it was

grossly unequal.

Thirty-five percent of the

present-day

voting age Negro population went to school before 1918, 50
percent of that present-day voting age population went to
school before 1930, before Mr. Jeffers the plaintiff's expert
knew anything about it, 50 percent.
Now in the period preceding 1918 with less than onefifth of the money spent on white teacher salaries was spent
on Negro teacher salaries.

The result was that 95 percent of

the Negro teachers had second-class certificates whereas most
25

40

1

of the white teachers had first-class certificates.
This Negro education in that day was in large part

2
3

in one classroom with all grades taught together.

Money,, of

4

course, is not the full answer to education but as we wall

5

know it can have a very serious practical impact on the

6

quality of education that results.
Finally, let me say that what we should be comparing

7
8

here, it is true that this last test was a relatively easy

9

test, we must remember that there was an oral test for a few

10

11

12
13
14
15
16
17
10

19
20
21

22
23
24

years before that which was not so easy — it involved reading
an oath.
But what we should compare is not high school
graduates of both races or even elementary school graduates
of both races, but those who only went to school for one, or
two or three or four years, as to them even the slightest
disparity would result in one group being able to pass the
test and the other not.
We know, as I have just indicated that there are many
in that category in Gaston County who were only eible for one
reason or another to attend school for this short time.
Finally, let me say that the suspension of the test
has had, though belatedly, a very substantial practical impact.
There has now been a 25 percent increase in Negro registration
in the county cut of originally some 4,100 Negroes registered
there are now 5,100 Negroes registered, a thousand increase on

25

this small number.

41

2

Q

I notice you have 52 to 61 percent.

Didn’t you

tell us yesterday?

That is correct but that works out ---

4

Does that work out to 25 percent?
