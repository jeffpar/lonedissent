PROCEEDINGS

HR., CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Petitioner,, versus United States, Respondent.

THE CLERK:

5

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No. 8, William Spinel3.i,

Counsel are present.
Mr. Friedman?

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

7

Court, I move that Mr. Joseph J. Connolly, a member of the Bar

0

of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, be permitted to argue this

3

case in behalf of the United States.

10

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

11

The motion is granted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRL B„ BARIS

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR.

13

BARIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

14

Court, this is a case arising originally in the United States

15

District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, where the

IS

defendant petitioner was tried and convicted and sentenced to a

17

term of three years imprisonment and a fine for violation of the

18

so-called Interstate Racketeering Act, Section 1952, of Title

19

XVIII.

20

Numerous points were raised upon appeal to the United

21

States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

22

hearings held in the United States Court of Appeals.

A reversal

23

was first obtained on a search and seizure question.

The Govern­

24

ment then petitioned for rehearing, which was granted, and upon

25

the prehearing before the Court en banc, the decision of the
3

-

-

There were two

1
2

District Court was affirmed.
We then applied petition before this Court for right

3

of certiori, which was granted on March 4 and subsequently it was

4

granted generally and subsequently in May that was limited to the

S

search and seizure question.

6

The problems in the area of search and seizure, the

7

Fourth Amendment problem, which appears in this case, rcay really

&

be broken down into three separate issues:

9

No. 1, as to the validity of the search warrant inso­

10

far as there being probable cause for its issuance; No. 2, with

II

reference to a time delay in its execution; and No. 3, with

12

reference to items which were seised upon the execution of the

13

search warrant.

14

The affidavit in support of the search warrant was made

15

by a special act of the Federal Bureau of Investigation before

16

the United States Commissioner and set forth a number of instance s

17

over a 12-day period during which the petitioner was seen to be

18

crossing an interstate bridge leading from the State of Illinois

19

to the State of Missouri.

20
21

There was also an indication that petitioner had a
reputation among law enforcement agents as a gambler.,

There was

i

22

an indication in this.affidavit concerning two telephones at a

23

particular apartment which the petitioner on some of these 12

24

days was seen to enter.

25

Finally — this I think is the crux of the issue
-4

1

involving the problem, because —■ the affidavit concluded the

2

FBI had been informed by a confidential •— excuse me, I had bette

3

say the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been informed by a

4

confidential, reliable informant that William Spinelli is operati

5

a handbook and accepting wagers and disseminating wagering infor­

6

mation by means of the telephones which have been assigned the

7

numbers and they specify the same numbers which had been indiI

3

cated earlier in the affidavit as being at this particular apart­

3

ment .

10

It is our belief that primarily based upon the other-

11

case, there are no underlying circumstances to substantiate the

12

hearsay information which was given to the Commissioner in this

13

affidavit.

14

there was no underlying corroboration, because there was nothing

15

to show the credibility of the alleged informant, that the affi­

16

davit was bad and, therefore, the search warrant was improperly-

17

issued .

IS

And that because it was not substantiated, because

We believe, if the Court please, that merely to say

19

bhat the Federal Bureau of Investigation has received information

20

vas been informed by a confidential reliable informant, that the

21

3etiv -oier is engaging in a handbook operation, does not corrobo­

22

rate itself and that there was nothing by virtue of the travel

£3
24
25

interstate commerce.
Ther

was nothing by virtue of the telephones being

the apartment,

'there was nothing by virtue of the petitioner"*s

-5

i

reputation which substantiated that»

2
3

Q

Would that have made a difference?

4
S

Suppose the affidavit had been sent confidentially*

A

Mot insofar as there not being any corroboration for

what ha said.

8

Q

Would that cure the alleged defect in the search war

3

A

7. don’t think it would,

9

Q

What would they have to do?

7

10

rant?

Would they have to disclcs

the name of a person in the search warrant?

11

A

No, McCray says it is not necessary.

12

Q

What would they have to disclose?

13

A

I thinks as indicated in the McCray Case, there must

14

be an indication in the affidavit as to why this man is con­

13

sidered to be an anti-reliable informant.

18

Q

Reliable and confidential informant and nonreliability

\1

wouldn't it serve the purposes if it were added to that who has

18

furnished this agent, say, with information about gambling on

19

other occasions?

20

A

And which has been shown to be adequate.

I would say

21

that under those circumstances I would like to see the rules set

22

forth that they must say how long this man has been used in his

23

reliability, how long he has been furnishing the inforitiation.

24

But I think you are getting to a situation which I would recog­

23

nize as being an indication in the affidavit as to his reliability,
-

6

-

1

Q

That is a bothersome point in the case, to say how road

2

has to be shown in a search warrant»

o

mants .

We have confidential infor­

You would say that ws are getting warm in a way if the

4

affidavit had said confidential informant of nonreliability who

5

has furnished information about gambling operations on other

6

occasions.

7

A

Yes, I would say you are getting warm, Mr» Justice

8

Fortas, and I would not be hare arguing that point as strenuously

9

as I am if that were in this case.

10
11
12
13

1 think the affidavit would

be bad for other reasons, as we have indicated in our brief.
Q

What are the other reasons?

It doesn't need anything

else to establish probable cause?
A

They would not need anything else, I think, to establish

14

the reliability of the informant or the credibility of the inforH-

15

ant, but you think there must be more in the affidavit than merely

16

saying that this informant says that Spinelli is operating a

17

handbook.

18
19

Q

And that he is given certain information as to other

gambling situations?

20

A

I would say, yes.

21

Q

What else would it have to have?

22

A

I would say that it should say that the informant said

23

that he saw someone placing a bet with Mr. Spinelli, that he

24

received information from Mr. Spinelli as to odds, and were he

25

to place a bet, that he himself placed a bet with Mr. Spinelli
7“

1

or that he in some way witnessed more than just a conclusion on

a

his part that he is operating a handbook.

3

Q

Is there any authority for all of that?

4

A

I think the Aguilar Case is an authority at point.
The function of the Commissioner is to determine whethe r

3
6

there is probable cause.

7

more than we had here to give the probable cause to the Commis-

8

sioner in the search warrant.

9

requires the issuance based upon probable cause and there must

10

I feel that the affidavit must contain

7. think the Constitution, of court a,

be an indication of the probable cause to the Commissioner.

11

Q

Which wording of the Constitution?

12

A

We have the Fourth Amendment;

13

"The right of the people
1
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against!

14

unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated and no

15

warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause and support by affix :*n

16

mative and particularly describing the place to be searched and

17

the persons or things to be seised."

18

Q

Who is to determine that?

19

A

It is to be determined initially by the Commissioner.

20

I think his determination is subject to review by the District

21

Court and by this Court, of course.
