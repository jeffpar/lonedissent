proposition that there was no implied trust?
A

No, sir.

I was just rebutting yesterday that I

thought he might have left this impression.
Q

Wall,

I want to be clear about one thing -- I thought

19

I was,, but I would like to get your view on it.

20

contest the finding or the conclusion of the court below?

You do not

21

A

No, sir,

22

Q

That there was an implied trust.

23

A

No, sir,

24

Q

And that the terms of that implied trust are that

25

I do not.

I do not.

this property will be used as part of and subject to the
25

i
i 2
! 3

mechanism of the church and the central direction and guidance
of the church and the church discipline?
A

Yes, with one qualification in here, because when we

4

talk about the implied trust, Mr, Justice, we are talking about

5

the imposition of equality, which is the doctrine and discipline

8

of the church, at the time

: 7

of

the acquisition of the property.

Now, what the Supreme Court of Georgia found -- and this was

8

on a statutory mandate that the court invoked -- the court

9

found under Section 2822408 of the Georgia Code that when

10

property is devoted to a specific doctrine or trust, the court

It

will intervene to prevent the property being diverted to a

12

doctrine which is contrary to that which existed at the time of

.13

the acquisition of the property.

14

Q

Well, you have, as I see it, in your case, it comes

ts

down to two points s

One, assuming that there is an implied

16

trust, which you agree to; tw’o, is that trust dependent upon a

17

maintenance of the church policy at the time the trust was

18

createdly, namely as of the time of the acquisition of the

19

property by the local church.

20

A

Yes, sir, that is correct.

21

Q

And, three, if that is so, was there such a change

22

in the policy of the church between the tine of acquisition

23

and the time of the disaffiliation so as to defeat the implied

24

t r us t.

25

A

Yes „
26

1

Q

Is that an accurate --

2

A

That is correct,

yes,

sir.

So we then look at the

3

Constitution to determine what was imposed upon the property

4

at that time,

5

which are sat forth in the action,

6

church.

7

3

then we look at the charged transgressions,
in the resolution of the

And let me just briefly refer to them.

3

I think --

Would you mind stating to me first how was this

trust

created?

9

A

10

Q

Did anybody sign anything?

11

A

Wo,

12

3

How was it created?

13

A

This trust, Your Honor,

sir,

under the --

there was no

It was created under the -- I would assume under what

14

we call the quality of this particular church government, which

15

is acknowledged to be a representative type church.

16

represented a type church,

17

of policy.

18

representative in its spiritual relationship,

19

here, but it may have congregational aspects in relation to

20

property.

For example,

of course,

But it

that may have a variation

a representative type church nay be
as we acknowledge

So what we have here under the theory --

21

3

22

A

23

3

Where do you get that?

24

A

This is an implication, Your Honor,

25

Jones,

Does the Constitution provide that?
No,

sir.

This is --

from Watson vs.

that they say in this particular type of church
27

1

government, where you have a series of ascending adjudicatories,

2

that there is an implied consent absent some particular trans­

3

gression of the Constitution that it is he 3-d for the belief it

4

of the church as a whole.

5

Q

Is that the only place you get it?

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

Then its

origin is in the secular laws in the sense

3

that either the legislature or a court has said that in these

9

circumstances, a trust or right?

10

A

Yes, sir, in thesecular

It

Q

And --

12

A

13

law.

There is no canonical law supporting this in this

particular case.

14

Q

Hone at all?

'15

A

Yes,

13

Q

So this is a doctrine

17

A

Yes, sir.

18

Q

of secular law?

You say -- apparently you don't argue that if the

19

terms of the trust which is imposed by the secular law may not

20

be adjudicated by the secular court, that therefore the trust

21

cannot be observed.

22

A

Ih Gonzalez vs „ Archbishop, Mr. Justice Brandeis, I

23

think, put this in focus for all of us.

24

came, I think, in about 1929 -- and some years after in Watson

25

vs. Jones -- in which he said "absent evidence of fraud,
28

He said -- and this

1

collusion or arbitrariance, that the secular courts are the

2

findings of an ecclesiastica]! court in matters involving

3

ecclesiastical lav;, even though civil rights are involved."

4

This theory has been followed by any number of decisions, both

5

state and federal subsequent to that time.

6

So what, with the Knowledge in Watson vs. Jones, you might

7

say it was by absolute deference to the authority of the

8

highest church court, it no longer -- it has been modified and

9

the court may nox; look beyond the rules formulated as to the

10
11

12

types of churches to be acknowledged there.
Q

Nox;, absent the doctrine of implied trust, could this

case get into court?

13

A

No, sir.

14

Q

And that is the creation of a court's opinion, do you

15

think, in Watson?

16

A

Yes, sir, subject to the complication of Gonzalez.

17

Q

It mixes the Court up considerably in connection with

18
19

the policies of the church of one kind or another?
A

No, sir.

May I take this exception?

When we look

20

you see, when we look at charged transgressions, we do not in-

21

guite into the faith that inspired those particular constitu­

22

tional command meats of the church in its organic law.

23

look at is at this organic law, in its doctrine and discipline,

24

and it is purely a factual matter.

25

Q

But is it a factual matter?
29

All x>;e

i

A

Well, the factual matter here is that the general

2

assembly made a pronouncement concerning civil disobedience and

3

becoming in civil affairs in direct conflict with the church 's

4

constitution.
Q

3
6

The constitution says you shall not do this.

Suppose it does that?

What does that have to do with

the titles of land that some people --

7

A

Well, under the theory that we are having to move

8

along on, sir, we have to go on the theory that this constitutes

9

a breach

of the trust.

And under the law, if there is a breach

10

of

11

high level, then the property is restored to -- still honoring

12

the concept, the constitutional concept.

Yes, sir.

you, and these are reflected in the judgment of the Supreme

11

Court of Georgia,

12

Q

Mr. Page, who do you think would be better able to

13

decide that question, an ecclesiastical court or an ordinary

14

jury in Savanna, Georgia?

15

A

Mr. Justice, under the theory that is presented to

16

us, and property rights being involved, it of necessity has to

17

go before the court.

18

Q

Before?

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

Before the

21

A

The secular court.

22

Q

— before the church courts have had an opportunity

23
24
25

to pass upon it?

In this particular instance, of course, we once

again ran across a rather unique situation.

We have the tribun; il

Wall, what is the reason you didn't follow through

Well, there were two reasons:

First, I think:,

this

action, as I mentioned, was made on the highest level and I

21

believe it might have been a little exercise in futility to

22

attack: the legislative pronouncements before the judicial body

23

which is going to determine its own legislative acts.

And,

■

more importantly, if — and this, I think, is devout -- if the

i

...

25

act of the general assembly is an unconstitutional act, in what
33

j

«

they did, then I don’t believe that it imposes any responsi­

2

bility upon the lesser tribunal, which is the local congrega­

3

tion, to appeal that act.

4

ation has been presented, where the high tribunal has been

5

accused of an ultra vires or unconstitutional act, they said

6
7
8

9
10
11

no appeal is necessary.

And certain courts where this situ­

I don’t believe it imposed anything

on them.
Q

So it is in part true, that you referred to rrandatory

findings on the churches or the statenents of views of the
hierarchy of the church?
A

Under the provisions of the church as set forth in

12

the resolution of 1880, there are two types of pronouncements:

13

one is the judicial decision and what is called the impeach

14

act --

13

Q

16

A

The what?
An impeach act decision, such as this.

And it says

17

that the members of the church have to submit to both, with

18

equal dignity and respect less they violate the constitution

19

of the Presbyterian Church.

20
21

Q

When you get down to the bottom here, is there any­

thing in the dispute at all except who controls this property?

22

A

No, sir.

23

Q

Nothing in theworld?

24

A

No, sir.

25

Q

Who controls the

property.
34

A

1
2

Who has its possession and use of the property.

That is right.
<

3

Q

And they claim that it is gone from the mother church?

4

A

That's right.

5

Q

And the big church wants to get it so it can do what.

6

use the property?

7

A

Yes, sir, so that it: can --

8

Q

But they have to get some other congregation, don't

10

A

Right.

11

Q

They have no congregation to go there?

12

A

That's correct.

13

Q

And nothing involved in this dispute except the con-

9

14

they?

trol of this property that the local people bought?

15

A

That's right.

m

Q

I suppose there is the question of whether this is

17
to
19

a departure from the church, isn't there?
A

Well, I am wondering, sir, if that assessment hasn't

bee n made.

20

Q

By xtfhom?

2i

A

Has it been made initially in the'-- when it was

22

presented in the local court.

23

Q

fell, it --

24

A

In part, I mean.

23

Q

I am ashing whether there was anything
35

involved in
I

I

this case other than property,.

2

stand it, it stands on the premise that this was a departure

3

from the constitution of the church and that the courts shall

4

determine that it is a departure from the dogma of the church.

5

A

You said no.

But, as I under­

I understood the question, when he said basically

6

there is no question who is entitled to possession of the

7

property.

Q

9

10

That is what I thought he said.

Q

That is exactly what I meant, and I can't see whether

the dogma of the church has anything to do with that issue.
Q

But your point is, as I understand it, that you in

li

effect agree that unless the court properly -- a court properly

12

finds that there has been a departure fran the church dogma,

13

church policy, as concerning clergy at the time of the aquisi-

14

tien of the property by the local church -- unless there has

15

been a departure by the central church, the church dogma or

16
17

policy,

then you agree that you're wrong and the central church

is right, that the central church is entitled to the property,

10

A

That is wrhat it comes down to.

19

Q

So your case really depends, as I see it, upon two

20

questions;

One, did the court below properly go into the --

21

do they have any business going into the question which you

22

put; and, second, was it properly decided.

23

at it from that point of view, your whole case depends not on

24

the property law in the common law sense but upon the question

25

of church dogrr.a.
36

So when you look

1

h

And applying the proper church policy to it.

In

z

this instance we find out under the theory there was not a

3

prescribed use in Watson vs. Jones, that the right t© dictate

4

this property as far as use, alienation, acquisition, who

5

shall be the minister, who shall finance the church program

6

and discipline all under the church constitution, is given to

7

the local church.

8

9

Q

On that point we did not agree with you two on that

issue about the trust, but one thought that a trust of the

10

church couldn't be decided in a court of law to taice away

II

property from somebody to whom it belongs on the basis of

12

church dogma.

13

A

Yes.

Then the case is quite different?
Then you would have to look in the record as to

14

the historical position of this church in relation to a church

15

property, and where it has recognised the church control in the

16

local —

17

Q

You say on page 18 of your brief that the simple

18

court has power to override the decision of the ecclesiastical

19

authorities, but to enforce its decision first would be offensis e

to peace and order; second, it would approve it arbitrarily

21

would violate this act; or, third, it would be repugnant to the

22

principle of equity.

24

about resolving the birth,control dispute in the church?

We have a lot of controversies in

37

How would your theory go

I know that is a raging problem.

1 don’t know whether -- I don’t taw what status that has with­

2

in the Catholic Church, whether it is a canonical situation or

3

not,

I couldn’t answer that, Mr. Justice.
Q

4

You’re talking about offense to peace and good order,

arbitrary or ultra vires,

this subsequently modifies Watson.

11

Now,

IE

Kedroff, Kedroff even said "we believe the right to select

13

clergy where no improper methods are shown is given constitu­

14

tional" -- so it gives this Court the right to look in,

13

that is what we contend, and historically where property has

been in dispute,

that is subsequent state and federal -- for example,

Yes.

Now,

if the jury disbelieved on everything else, if they disbelieved

its objections they made to the departure from the dogma is

Justice, I assume that is addressed to the judge
I certainly wasn't asking him to be disqualified.

In conclusion,

if you look at the record,

there is a

10

fatal federal question before this Court and I submit that

11

this case should be dismissed because there is no federal

12

question before the Court that seems to be raised.

13

are the four points that they raises

14

And here

They said that the federal question was raised in tie

15

Supreme Court of Georgia on a motion for rehearing and that

16

there were ruany question thrust before that court that were

17

entertained, the federal question was -- tie motion was

18

entertained and there were many federal questions presented

19

and answered.

20

violates the historical position of this Court that, on a

21

motion for rehearing, when the federal question is raised

22

first, you must entertain and decide.

23

That is not the record.

And, of course, ti is

The other question was that an overruling in Mack vs.

24

Kahn, they violated the rule of -- again, the Georgia Court

25

has adopted a federal rule in which you do not have a vested
42

right in a prior decision, and the Supreme Court of Georgia so
ru3ed.
Looking again at the other, that in overruling Mack vs.
!

Kahn, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments; the ap­
plication of Watson vs. Jones, this is not the case.

Mack

vs. Kahn specifically stated that on the proper showing of a
complete abandonment of the dogma and doctrine,

that the court

*i/Ou3d then protect the rights of the local property -- the
local church, who were adhering to the dogma and disciplines.
This coR.es

to absolutely no surprise to us.

All the Supreme

Court of Georgia did was to modify a substance of lav;, wl ich
it had the right to do, to change the complete -- to that is
substantiali.

J

And, finally, theyj contend that the federal question was
properly raised on the local -- at the initial level in the
trial court by the general allegations that this act -- that
the act of appropriating the property violated the laws of
the United States of America.

This lacked the required

specificity of the state court and also the federal court, and
there was no motion or other appropriate action taken in the
tria3 court to bring this federal luestion to the state court
and thus to this court.______ ___ _

-- let's assume for the moment that this Court held

that the First Airendment forbad the civil court from adjudicat-

law would still prevail?

This would be a trust implied by the secular law?

But both in Kedroff and Watson vs „ Jones,

17

duty of the civil court to close properly in the direction of

13

the ecclesiastical community.

Q

What would be your remedy to give possession of the

church?

order to the Presbyterian Church, that the Presbytery of

Q

Mr. Gorman,

you were going to give us citations --

5

There is nothing on the church law that deals

directly with the disposition of property or ownership of the

central church.

8

There is just one other thing I would like to know.

of departure from dogma of the church were not binding on any

tion and there is nothing in the Book of the Church Order and

18

nothing in the evidence of this case,

20

of those to remain a member of this thing,

21

All of the rest of them are merely statements of posi­

Now I understood counsel a few moments ago to say

22

that there were two kinds of pronouncements that would come fron

churches.

that are complained of, if you x^ill read the statements you

could have an entirely different position, and there is nothing

in it that says that any member of the cnurch has to believe
