ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD B. ELKIND, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. ELKIND:
Warren;

May it please the Court, Chief Justice

If the Court will indulge me by looking at the

10

title of the proceedings before the Court, there are some

11

matters which it is incumbent upon me to call to the attention

12

of the Court since they may, in the Court’s mind, be relevant

12

issue of Constitutional power to hear argument in the case

14

or at least

IS

to decide the case.

The title reads; "Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen,

IS

an Unincorporated Association".

17

stated in terms of contemporary events.

18

tion Union, an Unincorporated Association, and reading down

19

through the respondents, the Court will find that the Switch­

20

men's Union of North America, AFL-CIO, is a respondent in the

21

original proceedings.

22

That should be correctly
The United Transporta­

Also, that the Order of Railway

Conductors and

23

Brakemen are respondents.

24

now merged with the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen

25

Q

Those two responding unions have

Well, is there a case here, then?

A

I wish that there were because ■—r..

Q

How can there be?

’’his has to do with member­

ship and now they are all members of the same union.

4

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

5

Q

Is there a case here in Court?

8

A

I would like to address myself to the — I don't

7

want to say yes, but there is a serious question — but I

3

don't want to say.no.

9

Q

10

Do I understand that the merger — before there

were four unions --

11

A

There are now four unions, yes.

12

Q

What is the surviving ——

13

A

The other union of the engineers.

14

Transportation Union.

15

Q

Now, they are all members

16

A

The four are.

17

Q

The four are;

18

A

And the engineers union, the only union that

19

is not a part of the

Q

of

The United

the same union.

Mow we have a fight here whether ■

UTU has filed a brief amicus curiae

No, but as to the unions before us, the issue,

22

as I understood it, was whether it satisfied the requirement

23

of the union shop clause according to the members of the

24

Switchmen rather than the Railroad Trainmen?

25

A

That was the question.

3

*

i

Q

That was the question.

And now the situation

2

is that one of them was formerly a Switchmen and one of them

3

was formerly a Railroad Trainmen, but now are members of the

4

same union.

5

A

That is ——

6

G

Did anybody get fired for not joining the union?

7

0
9

How can there be an issue here?

Did anybody have to join the union that didn't want to?
A

No, but the union, and in agreement with the

Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and there is in existence a judgment

10

in the U. S. District Court affirmed through the court of

ii

appeals which holds that agreement to be void, invalid and

12

of no effect.

13

Q

This is a Federal case, isn't it?

14

A

It is.

15

Q

And if it is moved, of course, we wipe out

16

everything — the whole

17

back to the beginning»

18

A

Including the original judgment.

19

Q

Everything.

20

But you still have the same — 1 suppose that the

21

slate is wiped out clean all the way

fourth union is Firemen and Engineeers?

22

A

They are the fourth, yes.

23

Q

Yes.

24
25

And the Firemen and the Engineers have

a little thing going on between them, don't they?
A

That is right, sir.

1

Q

But they are not here»

2

A

No, they filed briefs --

3

Q

No, but this union, this surviving union, has

4

this issue still a large issue with the engineers»

5

A

6

Q

7

Because this surviving union has firemen and

enginemen in it.

8

A

9

Q

10

That is correct.

Right.
And they would like to enfox*ce the agreement

they had with the Erie Lackawanna with respect to the engineers

11

A

We wouldn51.

12

Q

But the engineers are not part of the issue»

They are not.

us about these events.

No, perhaps it would be appropriate if he
I don!t know quite what his position would be

19

but perhaps the Court would want to know, preliminarily, what

20

Mr. Leibik’s position is here.

21

Q

Well, is this a suit for damages?

22

A

There was a suit for damages, but there were no
c

25

damages.
Q

What was the claim for damages based on?

A

Well, there were none entered.

The judgment

does not provide for any damages in any event.

Mr. Elkind, doesn't the case of controversy

Yes.

attention.
Well if you hadn't, it would have been

called to your attention.
A

The only point I'would like to make,in addition

10

to those that have been averted to by the Court on this

11

Constitutional question, is that we have this strange situation

12

in the Railway Labor Act that a railroad will be subject to

13

a fine or a criminal penalty if they enter into this kind of

14

an agreement and it was approximately 15 years, as far as I

13

can make out, before a strict union ship agreement was

16

finally worked out between labor and .management.

17

Now, here we are on the very eve of having the

18

issue adjudicated.

19

position. There is nobody

20

on the other side unless Mr. Leibik, who appears here for the

21

respondent, is appearing for them and unless he claims that

22

they have an individual right not to pay the dues under the

23

union shop agreement that was made here.

24

that is his position here

23

Q

Apparently, we have lost our adversary
here, as far as I know, to argue

I don!t know whether

or not.

What do you argue to us -- that this is or is

6

not a case of controversy within the constitution?
A

My clients, the UTU and the Engineers union,

all the five operating unions that are affected by this agree­
ment, would like this issue to be resolved.
That is the reason why I am here.

They would like

to have answer that the only reason why there should be any
deviation from a strict union shop is to accommodate the
realities of intercraft transfers so that the only appropriate
situation before such a provision would be where there is
both an engineers contract on the property and a UTU contract,
and in that situation we would like to see the intercraft
mobility accommodated.
Q

I am sure that is true, but,as a legal proposi­

tion, what do you argue to us, that it is or is not a case
of controversy?
A

Well, I would say that there is not ~ I would

have to admit that,technically speaking,there does not appear
to be a controversy.

I have not heard anyone arguing on behalf

of the other side and that, by my standards, is basic to a
controversy.
Q

But you suggest that maybe counsel for the

other side would state his position on this particular matter.
Would you mind doing it?

OPAL ARGUMENT OP LEE LEIBIK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR, LEIBIK:
the Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

As of January 1, 1969, we have no independent

client having any continuing interest in this litigation. There
are no damage claims pending.
We received injunctive relief prior to the effective
date of the agreements here in question.
We would ask this Court to consider the matter on
*

the record and on the briefs submitted.
Q

Well, but what is your position

as to whether

there is a case of controversy here within our jurisdiction?
A

We represent the United Transportation Union,

because the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen and the
Switchmen's Union of North America has now been merged into the
United Transportation Union.

We do not believe there is a

judicious controversy before this Court.
Q
out?

Where does this roan, John P. O'Connell, come

You represent hint.
A

Yes.

They have no continuing interests, simply

because there are no damages alleged in the complaint on behalf
of any individual.

There are no damages incurred, of coiarse,

because we did receive injunctive release prior to the effec­
tive date Of this agreement,
Q

It would appear that both of you agree that

8

1

there is not a case of controversy here,

2

MR. ELKIND:

I might say this, Your Honorf that

3

in the next case that is to be heard, which arose from the 7th

4

Circuit, there, is a variation in the fact pattern in that it is

5

claimed, as I understand it, that there is a damage claim

6

outstanding and that, therefore, the Court may very well find

7

that there is a justiciable conterversy in that other case.

8

Q

In the other case.

9

A

So that we could, perhaps, get to the main issue

10

in the 7th

11

assume that if the case is treated as moot that the original

12

judgment would be vacated in the district court, in any event.

Circuit case.

MR. LEIBIK:

But as the matter stands now, I

And does counsel agree to that, too?
Yes.

Yes, we do.

Very well, the matter will be submitted, then.

(Whereupon, at 1:20 p.m. the hearing in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
