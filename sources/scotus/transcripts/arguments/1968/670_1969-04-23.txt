This is a criminal case froraCalifornia.

It involves

the application of the harmless error rule to comment and
instruction on petitioner's failure to testify at trial.
The crimes involved were robbery and attempted robbery.
The only issue was one of identification.
Mixed in a totality of the circumstances was a show-up,
a line-up and a showing of photographs by the prosecution to
witnesses before trial.
Also involved was the use of petitioner's silence
against him in another way.

That is, through the use of adoptee

admissions, through the use of petitioner's silence in the
face of accusations.
At trial, procedurally petitioner was without counsel
and defendant himself in pro pur.
On appeal there was a partial denial of counsel as
we will see.
2
i

The case began in 1962.

1

Petitioner was convicted

2

in the Alameda County Superior Court of two counts of robbery

3

and one count of attempted robbery.
He appealed, counsel was appointed, and counsel

4
5

briefed and argued the case.

The District Court of Appeals

6

affirmed the conviction.

7

affirmance wrote petitioner a letter saying he was withdrawing

8

from the case.

Counsel the next day after the

There was no evidence anywhere that counsel sent

9

a copy of that letter to the Court of Appeals.

10

Petitioner then

went ahead and filed a pro per petition for hearing in

11

California Supreme Court.

12

the

The court denied the hearing and

petitioner then came here.

13

He filed a pro pur petition for cert and in 1966 the

14

court granted the petition and in a per curiam opinion remanded

15

the case to the District Court of Appeals for further considera­

16

tion in light of Griffin against California.

All right.

petitioner counsel.

21

The court denies

It says he is still represented by his

original attorney and if he wants to file a brief he better

22

get one in promptly.

23

Petitioner eventually filed a brief in pro per.

24

The

State Attorney General sent a paragraph in a page and a half

25

3
l

1

letter to the court saying that the evidence was overwhelining

2

against petitioner and besides petitioner in his pro per

3

petition had not made any factual showing to show a miscarriage

4

of justice.
The court without oral argument about two weeks

5
6
7
8
9
10
11

after receiving the State's letter entered and filed an opinion
that incorporated its first opinion .by reference and referred
briefly to the evidence and then said that ”Xn view of the
overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt it was not
reasonably probable a different result would have been obtained
absent the comment on his failure to testify."
Petitioner again in pro per filed a petition for

12
13
14
15
16

certiorari in this court.

The court again granted the writ.

This time it remanded the case to the Court of Appeals with
instructions to reconsider the case in light of Chapman in
the harmless error rule.
Again Petitioner requested the court appoint counsel

17
18
19
20

for him.

He did this twice.

And again the court refused.

Petitioner eventually filed the brief in pro per in the Court
of Appeals.

The State didn't file a brief, it just sent in a

two paragraph letter saying it incorporated by reference
21
22

everything it had said before and it didn't have anything
further to add.

23
Without hearing argumenty without hearing anything
24
from counsel for petitioner who never filed anything on any of
25
|

the remands the Court of Appeals, the second time around,
entered a two-page opinion and said it considered the case
a couple of times before and incorporated its first opinion
by reference and then it went on to say in the sentence,

"After

further consideration we declare a belief based upon the con­
clusive evidence of guilt that the comment and error and the
comment on the failure to testify was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt,''
After that petitioner again came here, and he filed
a petition in pro per, again asking the court for a hearing.
The Court granted the petition last October, appointed counsel
and set the case down for argument.
In January this Court denied a motion by the State
to dispense with printing the record.
Now. the State contends that at this point on the
fotality of the record, the comment and destruction on petitioner1
failure to testify were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
It also raises two issues never raised before.
In the Court of Appeals or before on this court even.
though it answered petition for certiorari first is asays
to-'

•

that petitioner waived its Fifth Amendment rights by the
manner in which he defended himself in pro per during the trial.
During trial petitioner in cross-examining asked a
couple of questions that were less than articulate and it looked;
like he might have been testifying.

3

The court corrected him.

He got back on the track

and continued on.
At the end of trial, during oral argument and after
t he prosecutor had already commented on his failure to testify

5

and wrapped him up on that as his finii clinching point,

6

Petitioner came back and made a few statements that a lawyer

7

would make.

The court corrected him and

He said all right, judge, and then

he followed the court's instructions and went on and made his
argument to the jury as best he could.
Now the State claims that is a waiver.
his Fifth Amendment rights.

He waived

I think the evidence will show

as we go along that there was no such waiver.
Neither the trial court nor the prosecutor or any
of the lower courts that reviewed this case ever once suggested
there was a waiver and not once during argument to the jury or
any time during the trail did the judge ever tell petitioner
til at he was in danger of waiving his Fifth Amendment rights.
The other issue is a jurisdictional point that is
raised for the first time.
The State now says the Clerk can’t hear the case. It
made a mistake.

The State says that the court should not

have remanded the second time for further consideration in

it was proper that he come back here to the court that issued
the mandate rather than to a stranger court.
Q

Well our mandate

didn't say he should be given

a hearing did it?
A

It said for further proceedings in light of

Griffin against California.
Q

And so the question that you are presenting to us

really is on your theory of the case, is what should those
proceedings be or more specifically was the petitioner entitled
to counsel and then for purposes of those further proceedings
that this court ordered for remand.

That is No. 1.

And No. 2 you are raising the question of the standard
7

1

to be applied with respect to the determination of harmless

2

error.

Am I right?

3

A

4

What I am saying is that Petitioner has never had a

5

hearing on this Griffin comment and when I went to the record

6

the thing turned up to be a veritable can of worms.

?

the use of adopted admissions against petitioner and this

8

consisted, at trial now, the prosecution adduced evidence that

9

at the time petitioner's arrest the police officer said there

10

had been soma robberies and "Buddy, you fit the description.'5

Yes, Mr. Justice.

11

And petitioner remained silent.

12

Q

There was

He didn't do anything.

I notice in your brief you have got a very

13

elaborate brief and you argue a lot of points but aren't those

14

two points that I stated the points that are before us; that

15

is to say, one, whether on the further proceedings ordered by

16

us for the purposes of considering Griffin against California's

17

application to this case, counsel should have been appointed.
And, two, whether the Court below properly applied

18
19

the harmless error standard.
A

20
21
22
23
24

25

Correct, your Honor.

And in properly applying

the harmless error standard we look at the totality of the
evidence introduced against petitioner at

his trial and for

that reason we get into how the comment fitted into the overall
picture.
Q

Well, do you conceive then that the proper
8

1

Standard for determining whether the error was harmless was

2

whether it is not as the court below says -— it is or is not

3

reasonably probable that a result more favorable to Banks,

4

the Petitioner, would have been reached in the absence of

5

the error.

6

Do you believe that is a correct statement?

7

A

No, I don't.

8

Q

Why don't you tell us as succinctly as you cart

9

11
12

if you don't mind what you think the standard is.
from page 33 of the appendix.

15

what do you think is the correct standard?
A

declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless.

17

13

20
21

24

Q

What does that mean?

A

That means that the Court has to look at the

evidence, it has to look at the record, it has to look at the
overall context of the trial.

It has to be able to say that

this comment did not contribute to the conviction beyond a
reasonable doubt and as to that the burden is upon the State.
Mr. Justice, after going through this record and it

22
23

I think the correct standard is the one this

court announced in Chapman, that the court must be able to

10

You don't think the reasonable

probability of a more favorable result standard is correct,

13
14

I was reading

to testify is harmless.

case, guilt or innocence and no appellate court can sea

2

the widening of the jurors’ eyes.

3

already against this point that you can the harmless error

rule in the comment cases,, fotit what I am saying right now is

5

that when you get into the harmless error and harmless failure

6

to testify, you have to start in and re--weigh the whole case.

Now I know you have ruled

in.
Q

Well, certainly the Court of Appeals of the

First Appellate District of your State, when the case was
before it for the third time, not the second time which is
what Mr. Justice Fortas read, the third time after it had been
remanded in the light of Chapman, first it was granted as I
understand it in the light of Griffin and then it was remanded
in the light of Chapman.
This brief opinion appears on 341 and 342 of the
appendix indicates that the court at least purported to be
applying the rule enunciated in Chapman, didn’t it?

And that

such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, which is
exactly what you said the standard ought to be and was said
to be in the Chapman case.
A

Mr. Justice, what the Court of Appeals did was

repeat the language in the Chapman test but how could the
23
Court of Appeal decide this case without hearing a lawyer
24
argue the facts?
25
10
i

i

2

Q

Well, that is a different question but what I

am talking abotst is the standard that they verbalized.

3

A

Sure, the standard verbalized.

4

Q

Do you think the standard they verbalized is

5

acceptable to you under Chapman?

on the conclusive evidence what the court is saying that if

7

you look at the record and see the evidence, look at the

8

evidence of guilt —

What it means to me based

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

-- other than the comment, if it is conclusive

11

enough, it is harmless error.
don't believe that.

12

A

I

13

Q

Well, isn’t that what they said?

14

A

That is right.

15

there upon conclusive evidence of guilt.
Q

16
17
18

21

22
23
24
25

If you look at the other evidence, and it is

conclusive enough, it doesn't make any difference about the
error.

Now, do you think that is what Chapman means?
A

19

20

That is their phrasing, based

I would hope not.

I would hope not.

I would

think that Chapman means that you have to look ~ you don't
just lock at, you are not just weighing the number of balls
in a cannon on one side and the number of balls in the cannon
on the other side.

Chapman means that you look at all the

evidence, not just the evidence that points toward this one
result.
11

In other words, the fact that a jury convicted a

1

2

man is
Q

3

How do you ever — how can there ever be

4

harmless error then?

5

rule then, if you don't look at all the evidence

6

that it is so conclusive that this erroneous piece of evidence

7

didn't make any difference*

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

and decide

If you don't do it that way, how can you possible

8
9

How can there ever be a harmless error

do it?
A

I think you are agreeing with me, Mr. Justice.

You have to look at all the evidence*
Q

I know, but I think that is probably what this

court purported to do.
A

That is what it appeared to do.

Q

Well, how would you state it?

Would you say,

for example, that if there is any basis on which a jury might
rationally conclude that the defendant was innocent?
A

No, sir.

Q

The defendant is not harmless beyond a reason­

able doubt?
A

No, the way I think I verbalize the test is

the test has to be applied upon the basis of all the evidence
22
in the record, and if there is the slightest doubt that this
23

comment might have convinced one juror, one juror to believe
24

the evidence against the defendant — and you can't show that
25

12

1

that error was harmless.
Q

2

I see.

So what you would say that if there is

3

a basis in the record for thinking that a single juror might

4

have refused to vote for the defendant's guilt, then you can't

3

find harmless error?

6

A

That is right.

7

Q

And you further say that whenever you have

8

comment on his failure to testify there is such a basis?
A

9
10

He is not just up there beating his gums.
Q

11
12
13

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Exactly.

That is right.

But that I thought was

my point of view in the Chapman case and I was all by myself,
you know.

14
15

Well, why is the prosecutor making the comment?

A

Well, you have somebody with you, standing over

But we have to overrule the Chapman Case?

get a reversal in this case because in this case there is all
kinds of doubt that petitioner was the robber.

at night.

Heck, you had

You had two Chinese men come in

testifying, they were all excited.

One of them said he want

to the lineup and he couldn't identify petitioner.

He said

two weeks before trial the prosecutor brought around a photograph or the police brought around a photograph, a mug shot,
and says, "Is this man the man that held up your store?"
13

The witness looked at the photograph and on the back

1

of it was a description of the defendant, age, height, sise,

3

weight, name and on front was the numbers across the chest.

4

The photograph shox^ed the man likely to appear in court without

5

his hat.
Two weeks before trial the District'Attorney gets

9

ahold of the two guys that are at least certain of identifies”
tion at the lineup and calls them into his office and says, "I
want you to take a look at a picture here."
"Picture of whom?"

10

"Picture of the defendant, we are going to try."

11

"Pine."

12

"And while we are at it, let us take a look at his

15

clothes."

the night of the crime.
Then the witnesses come into court and they say,"Sure

16

17

we identified the defendant."
And all this came out at the trial.

18

22

The clothes he was wearing that he took from him

I mean any

right-thinking juror would have a little bit of doubt about
the validity of this eye-witness evidence where the police
bring in photographs and show them to the witnesses just before
trial.
I mean, for crying out loud, why were they doing it,

23
24

it wasn't just for the fun of it.
Again, to show you what kind of evidence the State

25
14

1

was using against petitioner which would cast a doubt upon the

2

fact that he was a robber,, to have this man who says he could

3

have recognized the robber again if he saw him in the next

4

hundred years.

Never forget his face.

He really saw him cold.

This man comes in and tells the jury that he didn't

5
S

remember whether the robber had any grease on his face, for

7

example.

3

the robber had any whiskers.

will show you where the real bite of this harmless error rule
comes in.
Here the District Attorney when the case was on
remand took, the clothing out of the files of the Superior Court
and destroyed the clothing used in evidence against petitioner,

24
so there is no way that an appellate court could ever look at
25

15

\

that clothing and see if it were being properly described during

2

trial.

3

He also took the diagram that was used against

4

petitioner at trial.

Attorney had someone come in from his office and make a rough

sketch and not one to scale and says "Well, this is the

Q

You are not suggesting, are you, any deliberate

No, X am suggesting the case dragged on, the

Q

Certainly, and the conviction was affirmed and

it was remanded by us only for reconsideration in the light of

didn't involve anything else.

he didn't think the Government had proved its case and so on.
The prosecutor got right back up to that and he said

to the jury, "Look here," he said, "you can't expect all the
witnesses to agree on what they saw and besides his lineup
showed that he was guilty, picked him out right there, and
besides that there is a lot of circumstantial evidence in
this case.

Lots of it.

Let us look at the circumstantial

evidence," the prosecutor said.

And this was the whole last

part of his argument to the jury, the closing argument.
He says petitioner here was cool, cool, you saw him
here in court, how cool he was defending himself.

Well the

robber was described as cool.
You heard the evidence that there was some money in
petitioner's pockets.

That is circumstantial evidence.
18

Other

i

circumstantial evidence is when the petitioner was accused of

2

being the robber by the policeman at the time of the arrest»

3

And one of the v/itnesses said to him in the lineup corridor,

4

"That is the man."

,

5

Petitioner remained silent.

That is evidence.

That

6

is circumstantial evidence and you can take into consideration

7

the fact that petitioner didn't testify and the court is going

8

to tell you and I am telling you now that if

9

denied it, you will be instructed that you can infer that ha

wasn’t able to deny it.

he could have

And you can take his failure to

testify into consideration.
Now petitioner's defense basically was that he was
a plumber, he had earned his money, he had been working up in
Pittsburg, a little town outside of Concord, outside of
Oakland, and the prosecutdr got up and says,

"Well, we know"

as his last punch at petitioner after this other failure to
testify business, he got up and said, "Well, you know petitioner
says he has earned his money and so forth, but we all know
lots of people who have bills and things like that, and we
don't know that the money petitioner had in his pocket was
the same money he earned.

Because he hasn't got on the stand

and told you."
And then he says petitioner asked why people rob.

23

He says you can ask lots of people why people rob.
24
persons you could ask that question.
25
19

Lots of

And then he says to the jury at the very end, winding

1

2

up, "You can take into consideration not just the direct

3

evidence but look at all this circumstantial evidence that we

4

have just been talking about»

5

that."

You can reach your verdict on

Then the court went on to instruct on these accusa­

6
7

tions, that that was something the jury could consider as an

3

admission of guilt, instructed on the failure to testify.

9

State makes a big deal out of petitioner copying somewhere from

10

the California Standard Instruction Book in long-hand the

11

instruction on the failure to testify and giving it to the

12

judge.

The judge had already told petitioner he was going to
give the instruction.

The judge didn’t give the instruction

that petitioner tried to write out but gave a far more damning
one and told the jury the petitioner was in a position to
understand all of this and know the facts and then denying
them and then the jury could take that into consideration.
There is one other point I want to testify to —
to bring up, not testify to -- and that is the denial of
counsel at trial.
Nov;, petitioner had been represented by the Public
Defender at the preliminary hearing and at arraignment and as
you can see from reading the briefs there are three crimes.
It is important that if he could as a tactical matter the
20

%

petitioner be tried separately on each of those crimes because

2

then you avoid that overlap and modus operandi argument that

3

the prosecutor made»
So petitioner goes to the arraignment and the public

4
5

defender tells the judge he wants to make a motion for separate

6

trials.

All right, but then instead of arguing the motion
he tells the judge we will take it under submission.
The next week or so they come back to court for a
hearing and the judge turns to the public defender, to the
prosecutor and says, "What do you have to say about this
motion for separate trials?"
The prosecutor, the D.A. makes his pitch.

Then

the petitioner's lawyer gets up and says, "Well, the pleadings
are defective."

And that is about it and the court overrules

the motion for separate trials.
Petitioner then the next time they go to court,
petitioner asked the public defender if he can ask the court
a question and he says to the judge, "Say, your Honor, I don't
think it is constitutional if you try me all at the same time
for these crimes."
And instead of defending, standing up for his client,

22

23
24

the public defender says to the judge, "Well, your Honor,"
he said, "this is the same thing I raised before a couple of
weeks ago and you have already ruled against petitioner and

25
21

i

he is just raising the same point now but on a different

2

constitutional ground."

3
4
5
6
7

The defendant says, "I think it is reasonable/'
and so forth.
And the judge without hearing from the D.A. simply
goes ahead and denies the motion.
Two weeks later petitioner comes back before the judge

8

for a hearing to set a trial date.

3

butts in, and he says, "Your Honor, can you take care of this

10

12

13

He says to the judge, he

And the public defender says, "I don't know what he
is talking about now, Judge."

You have already ruled on the

motion for a separate trial.
Then the judge denied and the judge says, "Well, he
is talking about separate trials on each of the three counts
and the motion is denied.
Then petitioner says, "Well, I don't want to be
represented any more by the public defender."
The court looks at the charges and says, "Pretty
serious crimes, you can't waive them."
But thQ petitioner says, "I don't want to be repre­
sented by this man any more.

It doesn't look like the public

defender's office is any match for the D.A, around here,
not qualified."
Well then the judge says, "All right, you can go to

25
22

1

trial by yourself but we will have someone from the public

2

defender3s office sit inside the courtroom with you to help

3

you out.
And just then the public defender pipes up and says,

4
5

"Wait a minute, your Honor, may I be heard?

6

looks like a wise guy»

here.

Look, this guy

He is trying to pull something off

He is trying to look like the poor little man in front

of the public D„A. being picked upon and if one of these legal
points bounces on him it is going to be real tough.

I don8t

want any part of this mixed-marriage, either he goes alone
or he goes with us."
Then the Court then said to the public defender,
"Listen you have someone there in court."
So about two weeks later petitioner comas up for
trial before a different judge and this judge gives proper
petitioner warning, inquires into petitioner's background,
he finds out he has got a record.

A young man in Illinois

who has been convicted for murder, been out on parole in
California, working as a plumber up in Pittsburg, sixth grade
education, mentally defective, been in a hospital, mental
treatment, emotionally upset about the charges and the judge
says, "You can't defend yourself.

No man should defend himself

22

on a felony charge."
23

And petitioner says, "I am not going to stick with
24

this public defender.

1 want somebody who is qualified and

25
23

1

someone who I have confidence in.
The judge says, "Well, take the public defender or

2
3
4

nobody,"
Meanwhile, while all of this is going on, of course,

5

there is an assistant public defender listening to what happens

6

at trial, what is being said.

23
24

The case comes back, the judge says, "Well, all right,
you will have to go by yourself,

I can't give you any help,"

And then petitioner in a real flash of brilliance
says to the judge, "Well, it will look better on appeal if
I go up without counsel."
And the judge jumped up and he says,

"What do you

mean by that?
Petitioner says, "What I mean is, I think I still
have a right go counsel, to appoint someone other than the
public defender."
So he goes before the next judge.

He disqualifies

the judge and he asks for a change of venue to go back before
the first guy.

He gets back before the first judge, the one

who heard the public defender call him a wise guy and this
judge says, "Well, you can still have the public defender."
He says, ”1 don't want the public defender.

Just

appoint anybody from the Oakland Bar, anybody other than the
public defender, somebody 1 can believe in."
The judge says, "Go to trial with the public defender

25
24

t

2

or without anybody,"
And then he says, "Well," and then petitioner says,

3

"Well, how about this guy who has been sitting here, the

4

Assistant Public Defender."

5

The Assistant Public Defender was present during the

6

second proceeding when all of this came out about petitioner's

7

background and so forth.

He didn't say a word to the judge

He kept his mouth shut.

So the third judge,

X mean the first judge who heard

petitioner called a wise guy and finally the judge who tried
the case but the public defender was inbetween them both didn't
report back to the trial judge what he had heard at the
prior proceeding that petitioner had a sixth grade education,
was a plumber and so forth and so petitioner goes to trial.
Q

He doesn't sound so retarded though.

A

Well, if you see what the judge said to him

during voir dire, Mr. Justice, petitioner

conducting voir

dire to the jury you see and here he is alone and he says
to the jury, he is trying to explain what separate offenses
are and if the jury can keep them straight.
And one of the jurors says, "X don't understand
the question."
The judge says to the juror, "Well, you can come
over here and join me."
And then another time during the voir dire petitioner

25

25
I

I

1

was asking the juror about juvenile delinquency — and I will

2

shut up right after this -— but he askec the judge about »—

he was asking about juvenile delinquency

and the judge says

to the petitioner, "You look a little bit old to be talking
about juvenile delinquency, ha ha ha."
And there is petitioner taking it on the chin.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. O'Brien.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD P. O'BRIEN, ESQ.

9

ON BEHZiF OF RESPONDENT

10

MR. O'BRIEN:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
12

The initial poinc that I wish to bring to this
13
14

Court's attention is that of this Court’s jurisdiction to
review the present case.

15
16

17

This Court's jurisdiction in reviewing State court's
decisions is, of course, limited to those judgments rendered
by the highest court of a State in which decision could be had.

18
19

20

After this Court remanded the Banks case to be
reviewed in light of Chapman, the Court of Appeals of California
rendered its decision on October 2, 1967.

Petitioner did not

21

thereafter petition for a hearing in the California Supreme

22

Court.

23
24
25

It is well settled that the judgment of an intermedia!
appellate court is not that of the highest State court where
26

1

discretionary review is available and not sought.

2

precisely the situation here under the California Constitution

3

and laws, the California Supreme Court has discretionary power

4

to review the Court of Appeals.
And; therefore, the judgment in this case is not

5

6

that of the highest court of the State.

7

8

That is

Q

Wow,

had

he asked the Court of Appeals for

A

Yes, your Honor.

counsel?

9

On the remand, he sent a letter in to the Court of

10
11

Appeals stating that he wishsdaa second counsel or a different-

12

counsel, and gave as his reason that his appointed counsel on

13

the original appeal, decided in 1964, did not raise the

14

Griffin constitutional issue.
The Court of Appeals answered petitioner's letter

15
16

and pointed out to him that he was not, in effect, that he

17

could not expect counsel to anticipate that to be clairvoyant

18

to spot the Griffin issue in 1964.
Indeed, this court has said as much in the O'Connor

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

versus Ohio case and he gave no other reason to the Court of
Appeals as to why he should be entitled to a second or different
counsel.
In the reply brief in an effort to avoid the

Did he argue?

No, your Honor.

There was no argument in the

Q

Well, did he have counsel?

A

Yes, your Honor, he did.

Q

How?

A

He had been appointed counsel, Mr. Chefsky, by

case.

the Court of Appeals and on each remand, the Court of Appeals
13

informed both the petitioner and his counsel that if they
14

wished, they could submit additional written argument on the
15

Griffin and then the Chapman issue.
16

Q

But did he have counsel in any effective way?

A

Yes, your Honor, in this sense, that he had

17

TO
appointed counsel and then it was a choice by counsel as to
19

whether or not to file a supplemental brief on the Chapman case.
20

Q

Well, wasn't the case sent back for that purpose?

A

For the Court of Appeals to review in light of

21

22
Chapman, yes, your Honor.
23

Q

And I would assume that counsel on both sides

24

would be prepared to argue on that point?
25
28

1

A

Yes, your Honor, they would be.

z

Q

And in this case, petitioner had no counsel

3

on that point?

4

A

Oh, yes, well 1 disagree with your Honor.

5

Q

Well, show me something that he said, wrote or

6

did, the counsel.

7

A

He did not write anything to the court.

8

Q

Did he say anything to the court?

9

A

No, your Honor, he did not.

10

Q

And yet you say that he had counsel?

U

A

Yes, your Honor, the question being in other

12

words, we can take a case in which a case is before a court

13

and while it is before that court, a decision by this court

14

or perhaps by the California Supreme Court comes down and the

15

question would bet

15

whether retained or appointed, to file a supplemental brief

17

on this case which has impact on that appeal.

Is there a duty on the part of counsel,

Now, I think in that situation that due process does

18
19

not require an automatic brief, or supplemental brief to be

20

filed in that situation.

21

c cansel on the initial appeal and he ——
Q

22
23

What you really mean is, if he is so guilty he

doesn1t need it?
A

That is what we have here. He had

his guilt.
29

It has nothing to do with

Q

1

Well, you don't take the same position as the

a

court, though, do you, that just because he is guilty nothing

3

will save him?
A

4
5

No, your Honor, and I don't believe the court

took that position in this case»

6

Q

What was that last sentence in the opinion?

7

A

Your Honor, I believe the court applied the

8

standard laid down by this Court in Chapman that the question

9

was whether or not the error in viewing the error, whether or

to
11

not the court could declare a. belief that the error was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt»
Now, in applying that standard laid down by this

12
13
14

court, certainly a court of review must take into consideration
two factors, two factors or more»
One is the nature of the error and the extent of it

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

and,

secondly, the nature of the case.

what

the Court of Appeals did in the Banks case.
Q

And that I believe is

But here you have some sort of a proceeding

when the case was before the court for the third time, did
Mr. Chefsky file a paper or enter an appearance -- I assume
his appearance had been entered before, had it?
A

Yes, earlier.

Yes, your

Honor.

Q

And if you consider this as part of

the same

record as I suppose we might, you would assume nevertheless
that counsel would file some sort of a paper and say, "Well, I

30

1

2

ara still counsel to petitioner»
A

I have nothing further to say.

Well*, your Honor, there had been a series of

3

cases before the California Appellate Courts involving remands

4

from this court and all possible variations occurred, namely,

5

that counsel do not file a brief, that they do file a brief

6

and that some are argued, and the results also vary where in

10

II
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

some cases there is no argument or brief and nevertheless the
case may be reversed, depending on the nature of the case.
Q

Well, I have seen a lot of those cases and I

guess that is one of the reasons for a good deal of interest
in this case on my part.
A

Well, yes, your Honor.

Q

You see what 1 mean.

A

Yes, your Honor, but I would point out that the

courts have, depending on the nature of the comment, and
various facts and circumstances, they have both reversed and
affirmed in the individual cases.
Q

Do you have a procedure in California of an order

which says "upon the briefs and arguments"?

I know it is in

the order here, because you couldn't have such an order here.
You couldn’t file an order that said "The court upon the
consideration of the case and briefs and arguments orders".
They couldn't say that here?

23
24

A

No, your Honor.

And the more common order I

would say is merely that the cause is submitted.
25

31

Q

1

2

Well, was this submitted?

Was this submitted?

Did the petitioner ever submit this case to the court?

3

A

Yes, your Honor.

lawyer.

argue?

Did he say he submitted and didn't want to

Did he waive argument?
A

Mo, your Honor, he didn't.

Q

Well, why wasn’t he permitted to argue?

A

Your Honor, he was — for the simple reason

that he had counsel and that in such a situation the defendant
does not npresent the argument.
Q

And so the counsel can waive his rights?

A

Clearly, yes, your Honor.

In other words, I would say that the practice in
courts on whether or not you argue a case on appeal after is
the choice made by counsel.
Q

It is?

A

There are many cases, your Honor, in which the -

Q

Well, assuming that the paying client says, "I

22
23

want you to argue,” what happens?
24

A

Well, your Honor, that would --

25

32

Q

1

Well, if the paying client says, "I have given

2

you $25,000 more dollars and I want you to argue my case,”

3

you mean counsel submits without argument?

4

A

Well, that would be up to the individual counsel.

5

Q

It sure would.

6

But in this case, this man had an almost nonexistent

7
8

9
10
11
12

13
14
15
16

counsel?
A

Well, your Honor, in the situation of retained

counsel that you speak of, retained counsel on occasion both
in criminal and civil cases, make a determination not to
orally argue the case,
Q

Well, he didn't argue this any way, either

orally or written.
A

No, your Honor.

It i*/as originally argued by

the counsel, your Honor.
Q

But in this one that is before us now, counsel

didn't argue any way, any how, any time, any place.
17
A

He did not argue the Chapman issue, your Honor.

18
19

He did argue the entire case before the Court of Appeals when
it was before them.

20
21

Q

This time?

A

No, your Honor.

Q

Well, I am talking about this time.

22
This is

23
the one that is before us nov/.

He did nothing.

24
A

Yes, your Honor.

However, when the case is

25
33

I

1

reamdned it is back before the court as a current appeal,

2

Q

And his counsel did nothing?

3

A

He filed no documents with the court, your Honor.

4

Q

Did he do anything else in the court?

5

A

No, your Honor.

6

Q

I wonder if you would tell us whether there is a

7

rule of the District Court of Appeal with respect to oral

8

argument,
A

9
10
11

12

15

a matter of practice, oral argument in the Court of Appeals
in California in many cases is not conducted.
Q

10

I wondered whether there was

making that decision?
A

Well, your Honor, the — I think it merely states

that it may be done and is not particularized, and in practice
it is done quite often through even phone calls.
Q

19

20

I understand that.

a rule of court that would indicate who has the option of

16
17

Your Honor, as well as I know, the question of

oral argument is that it is not required in every case and as

13
14

and if so, what is it?

You mean just by the court, doing it without

asking parties, the court just deciding a case without asking
parties whether they want to argue it or not?

21

A

22

Well, in this type of situation, namely when

we are dealing with the equivalent of a supplemental brief on
23

a particular point, as distinguished from the initial, original
24

appeal.
25

34

Q

t

In assuming that you were wrong,, on your ideas

2

about the lawyer, what do you say about the rest of the case?

3

Assuming that you were wrong and the court might think well

4

then I will have the lawyer come in and argue that point,

5

which is a reasonable position I would say.

6

A

7

Then the next question is that of the effect of the

8
9
10

II
12

comment in this case.

15
16

Now it is necessary to look both at the

comment and the evidence in this case and particularly in this
case, unlike most cases before this court and the California
courts, we have the unusual situation that the petitioner in
effect attempted to testify to the court on certain matters.
Throughout his cross-examination of various wit­

13
14

Yes, your Honor.

nesses, the petitioner made testimonial statements concerning
his actions on the night in question and also concerning
statements of witnesses.
f

The prosecutor objected and the court admonished the

17

j

i
I

18
19

£0
21

22
23
24

jury to the effect that the petitioner had not taken the
stand and that the statements could not be considered as
testimony.
Now this court has held in the Caminetti cases and
later cases that the privilege against self-incrimination can’t
be waived when a defendant elects to testify and indeed this
court approved a comment by the court in Caminetti that the
jury could consider the defendant’s failure to explain acts of

25

35

1

incriminating nature that the evidence established againsthira

2

in reaching their conclusion as to guilt or innocence.
Q

was harmless error.

Q

Now that requires a consideration of the evidence

It does, your Honor.

Now, referring to that evidence, the evidence shows
that there were within the space of one hour, there was an
attempted robbery, two completed robberies and an aborted
robbery committed within one hour.

19

20
21

Yes, your Honor.

A

15

18

A

doesn't it?

14

Well, are you sure about that.

No, your Honor, but it is before this court as

to whether or not the comment in this case was erroneous.

But that is not the basis on which the decision

Q

Where?

A

In Oakland, California, in East Oakland,

California, all within the same basic geographical area.
The first attempted robbery occurred at approximately

22

11 p.m. at Vince's Liquors, which involved Roger Wong and
23

Harry Jow.

The petitioner walked to the rear counter and

24

standing three feet from the witnesses, lifted his right in
25
36

1

his coat pocket in this manner (indicating) and said, "Give

z

me all your money,”
He then said, "Do you want to die?

3
money."

4

When Wong heard this, he lookeddat petitioner and he

5

saw the pocketed hand on the counter,

6
7

Wong then picked up a

,38 pistol from under the counter, reached over and he struck
the petitioner on his pocketed right hand,

8

Wong then ordered the petitioner to hold his hands

9

up and the petitioner said, "Go ahead and shoot me," but

to

Mr. Wong testified that he could just shoot the man and the

11

petitioner then left the store.

12

Fifteen minutes later at about 11:15, Petitioner

13

entered the Three Point Liquor Store, approached the clerk,

14

Perry, and again with his right hand in his pocket, simulating

15
a

16

Give me all your

j

a gun, said "Hand over the money."
When Perry did not respond, Petitioner said, "If you

17
18
19

don’t want to jeopardize your life, hand over the money.

And

I'm not kidding."
Q

You say petitioner said that.

Who identified

A

Mr. Perry, the witness to who he was demanding

20
21

22

the money identified him and two other witnesses, Mr. Griffith
23

and Mr. Jones who were in the store.
24

Now Mr. Griffith x^as standing right behind the
25

37

-

1

petitioner and as petitioner then left, Mr. Jones came in and

2

in effect bumped into him.

3

Now, both Mr. Perry and Mr. Griffith identified the

4

petitioner and there is no question about their identification

e
M»

at the trial level.

22

They also identified him at the lineup, and were,
Mr. Perry was quite positive in his identification.
Q

How many people identified him?

A

Well, your Honor, there is again additional —

he then robs, petitioner than robs Linden Liquor Store at
about 11:30, and at that point the store is owned by
Mr. Pauletich, he again simulates a gun in his right hand
contained in the pocket -—
Q

The precise method that was used at the other ■——

A

Yes, your Honor.

And demands the money. And he obtains $165, including
30 to 40 $1 bills.

As the petitioner was leaving --

Q

How many identified him there?

A

The owner, your Honor, Mr. Pauletich.

Finally, 15 minutes later approximately -—
Q

Is there any question about the identity there?

A

No, your Honor, and I will bring that out in

that the robbery occurred at 11:30.

He then goes to Sobek's

23
Liquor Store and goes into the store and asks the proprietor,
24

Mr. Smith, whether he had a gun.
25

38

1

Smith says, "Why do you want to know?"

2

And petitioner says, "Well, I might want to hold you

3
Just then Officer Nielsen walks into the store.

4
5
S
7

tells Nielsen what petitioner had said.

10

Banks, "Buddy, you fit the description."
The officer then arrested him and in searching for
weapons they discovered various currencies in $lss, $5's and
$10's in his pockets.
The officers then bring the petitioner to the closest

11
12

Nielsen informs him

that there had been some robberies in the area and says to

8

9

Smith

store, Linden Liquors which Mr. Pauletich owned.

13
14

Q

There were three robberies?

A

Yes, your Honor.

There was one attempted

robbery, two completed robberies and one aborted robbery.
15
And there was a total of six witnesses at the first

16

three stores.

There are two in the first store, three in the

17
second store and one in the last store.
18
Q

Yes.

A

Then they bring him back «r-

Q

Did anybody deny that or was there an alibi

A

No, your Honor, no alibi.

19
20
21

shown?
22
The only defense

23
and it was a very weak defense presented in this case is that
24
he had earned money at a prior time and even that, when the
25
39

i

1

witnesses are examined they are confused about the dates and

2

about the amounts of money.
Q

3

Was there any testimony by the defendant,

4

offered by the defendant for witnesses, not from himself as

5

to indicate where he was at the time these robberties occurred?

6

A

None, whatsoever, your Honor.

7

After, the petitioner was then taken to the last

8

store and Mr. Pauletich identified him, stating "That is the

9

man."
He was then taken to the Oakland Police Department.

10
11

The officers found more money in various pockets and his wallet

12

for a total of $176, including 31 $1 bills, similar to the

13

amount described by Mr. Pauletich.

14

Q

As having been taken from him?

15

A

That is correct, your Honor.

Then when Nielsen asked petitioner where the money

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

came from petitioner responded that he cashed a check that day.
He never attempted to show that he had cashed a check that day
at trial.
Officer Nielsen, still concerned about the gun, since
each of the witnesses had mentioned the hand covered in the
pocket, said, "What did you do with your gun, Fred?"
Petitioner responded, "I didn't havea gun.

If I

had one, I would probably have killed somebody tonight.
Guns make me nervous."
40

1

Now we then look at the comment in this case.

2

Q

And before you get to the comment, is that

3

evidence which you have given all the evidence that appears

4

with reference te his guilt or innocence and is that the

5

evidence on which the court found that the error in the comments

8

was harmless?

7
6

9
10

11
12

13
14
15
18
17
10

19
20

21
22

A

Yes, your Honor.

There were other corroborating

circumstances which I should inform the court of. One was
that as you recall,

-Wong at the time he was being robbed,

reached over and hit Banks on his hand with a gun because he
couldn't bring himself to shoot the man.
After he positively identified Banks at the lineup,
he had requested the officer to look at his hand. He looked
at his hand and there was a black spot right on his right hand.
Q

That was the hand he had used?

A

That was the right hand he was simulating a gun

in the robberies.
The other point would be the 31 $1 bills, similar to
the money that this Mr. Pauletich described.

The other is the

statement previously mentioned that he made to Mr. Nielsen,
and, of course, quite important is the seventh witness, namely
the witness to the aborted robbery.
Now there, there can possibly be no question about

23
the identification there for the simple reason that while he
24
is starting in on it, the police come in and he again had made
25
41
3

1

the statement to Mr. Smith, "I might want to hold you up”

2

in relation to his question whether he had a gun.

3

That is the evidence —-

4

Q

And in addition to that, does the State make any

5

argument that the judgment of its judges that this error was

S

hamless was entitled to any consideration here?
A

7
8
9
10

Oh, yes, your Honor.

Clearly, for the simple

reason that in this case the appellate court has reviewed this
question in light of Chapman and it has come to the conclusion
that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
.

It has expressed its belief as required by this

11

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

court so that this is not, of course, a question of initial
review

or the question of the application of the standard as

was po^ed to this court in Chapman, where this court had to
decide both the standard and then apply it.,
This case, the standard has been applied by a Court
of Review and it has come to the determination that in this
case the comments were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
Q

Mr. O'Brien, are these the same judges that

heard the other one?
A

Your Honor, I believe ---

Q

I can find it.

A

I believe they would be the same, your Honor.

23

The change did not occur until after that time.
24

Q

This court was the first appellate district?

25

42

1

A

Second Division, yes, your Honor.

2

Q

Second Division, and that is what area of the

State?

3
4

A

That is basically the San.Francisco Bay area.

Q

And this trial was in San Francisco, in the

19

And the Judges were Judges Schumacher,

,

Agee and Taylor?
A

That is correct.

Q

And that is Division 2?

A

Of the first district.

Q

And does that consist of only three judges?

A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

Unless there was a change of personnel —-

A

There was no change at that time.

There has

been subsequently but not on these decisions.
Q

I suppose that there is some doubt as to

whether the court applied the correct standard contemplated
by Chapman.

The question is whether the harmless error is

20

harmless error in terms of a judgment of the court, that there
21

was conclusive evidence of guilt which is what was done here
22
or whether the court's task is to determine whether beyond a
23

reasonable doubt no rational nor reasonable jurur could have
24

felt or could have arrived at a different conclusion absent the
25

43

1
2
3

improper comment?
A

Weil, your Honor, I believe the Court of Appeal

in this case applied that standard.

4

Q

Applied which standard?

5

A

Pardon?

S

Q

The Court of Appeals applied the first standard;

7

that is to say, it looked at the whole record and said on the

8

whole record we find there is conclusive evidence of guilt

9

but I am suggesting the possibility that may not be the same

20
21

22

thing, as if the Court of Appeals had looked at it to determine
whether a single juror might have declined to find the
defendant guilty in the absence of the-- >
A

Well then, your Honor, we get into a question of

what this court stated in Chapman and in that situation this
court stated it was merely a restatement of the original Fahy
standard, namely whether there is a reasonable possibility
the evidence

complained

of

might have contributed to the

conviction, and I think that is the standard that was applied
here and that it is the -- that Chapman contemplated a review
by the reviewing court on that question.
Q

Mr. O’Brien, do you think that when this court

sends the case back for reconsideration in the light of a cer~
t

tain case that the court can just say without more, to — "We
23

have considered it and we adhere to our former opinion," and
24

that is exactly what happened in this case.
2,5

44
1

1

It says, "Now we are again directed after appellant's

2

petition to the United States Supreme Court to reconsider our

3

determination in view of its decision in the light of Chapman

4

versus California."

5

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

And the Chapman case, the United States Supreme Court
announced that before a Federal constitutional error could be
held harmless the court must be able to declare a belief that
it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
We have given further consideration to this cause in
the light of Chapman.

We approve and adopt this part of this

opinion incorporated herein by reference our original decision
September 16, 1964.
That is all they did.
A

Well, your Honor has omitted the most significant

part, namely the final sentence, namely as to the error in
commenting and instructing on defendant's failure to testify,
we declare a belief based upon the conclusive evidence of his
guilt that such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
The court here complied with the remand by this court,
namely, to consider the Chapman standard.

This court did not

say "Reverse this case."
Q

No, not at all.

22

But my point is this:

Do you think that when we

23
send a case back to be reconsidered in the light of another case
24

that all the court has to do is to say without more, "We have
25
45

1
2

reconsidered it and we adhere to our former opinion."
Do

you not think it calls for some review of the

3

situation through counsel or through petitioner or some way

4

to satisfy the mandate of this court?

11
1?.

13
14
15

16
17
18

IS
20
21

22

A

Well, your Honor, I think that the reviewing

court makes that determination and in some cases may determine
to proceed in that manner but in other cases would proceed in
the manner in which it did here, namely, sending a letter to
counsel and petitioner asking whether or not they choose to
submit additional written arguments»
As far as the manner in which they treat it in the
opinion, I think they have applied this standard»

Now, it

would seem to me to be a matter of discretion with the State
courts as to whether or not they go through an extended opinion
pointing out the precise nature of the comment, the circum"
stances surround it and then referring to the evidence»
Q

Could I ask you a question?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Since Chapman, have there been cases in your

court where there has been a remand from this court where your
court has invited counsel to participate in the argument?

In

the reconsideration?
A

Oh, yes, your Honor»

Q

There have been?

A

No, they are not.

23
Are those listed in your brief?

24
25
46
I

Q

s

You understand my question.

It is prompted by

2

your suggestion that it was discretionary of the state court

3

to invite counsel to submit a brief or submit an argument for

4

having looked over the record to say, "No, there is not enough

5

there to warrant that procedure."
My question is whether they have ever done that in

6
7

any case since Chapman.
A

8

D

Well, your Honor, I would actually say that

they have done it in every case that I am familiar with, namely

10
11
12
13

16
17
18

Invited counsel?

A

Yes, your Honor, sending letters stating that

the case has been remanded.
Now, quite often counsel on the case will not

14
15

Q

receive the documents from this court of remand.

They go to

the Court of Appeals and are not necessarily — counsel on
the case is not necessarily binding, depending on whether or nob,
of course, he was on the petition for certiorari.
Q

19

Does the court act

that kind of a case or if counsel

on its own initiative in
doesns t make a motion for an

20

argument, is it simply dealt with by ——
21

A

No, your Honor, it is basically as in this case

22
by way of a letter advising him of the situation and then asking
23

whether or not they wish to submit additional written argu­
24

ments .

That is the basic practice that I am acquainted with in

25

47

1

both the First District and for that matter other districts»

2

Q

Was there such a letter in this case?

3

A

Yes, your Honor.

4

Q

It was a letter that went to the lawyer?

A

Yes, your Honor.

S
7

There is a letter to the

lawyer which states precisely that.
Q

Is that in the appendix?

A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

Could you lay your hands on it quickly?

A

Yes, I can.

Page 326, your Honor, would be one example in which
the letter to Mr. Banks with a CC to Mr. Chefsky, states the
United States Supreme Court has vacated the judgment of this
court in the above-entitled case and Ibs remanded the case to
us for further proceedings in ligftt of Griffin versus California
This court wishes to know whether it is your desire
to submit anything further to the court by way of written

17
argument before we proceed to decide the case pursuant to
18
the directions of the United States Supreme Court —-19

20
21

Q

Wasn’t that before the second, not the third --—

A

Well, yes, your Honor, there is a similar letter

on the current one in which it states, "Enclosed is a copy of

22
an order vacating the submission granting you 30 days in which
23
to file a supplemental brief."
24
Q
25

What page is that?

No, no brief discussing the issue of retro­

The basic

decision in Roberts was that Bruden would bs retroactive.

What do you think Chapman meant by the reference

to the burden, burden on the party which had one below?

review.
The two cases cited by counsel merely state that the
Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to review a Court of Appeals
after the statutory 60-day period has expired.
Well, obviously, that is true of any basic review
including certiorari in this court.
Q

Well, what actually happened here when we sent

back for the first time under Griffin, all that the record
shows is an opinion which ends with "judgment affirmed."
Now, what does it mean by judgment affirmed?

That

is a judgment of conviction, isn't it?
A

That is correct, your Honor.

Q

The initial judgment of conviction.

Was there

any new judgment entered at all at that time?

Not at the trial court, however, your Honor.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. KLITGAARD:

Mr. Justice Black, you asked about the evidence of

Furthermore, the last robbery, the one involving
Pauletich netted some 20's, $20 bills and when the police
searched petitioner they didn’t find any $20 bills on him.

He

did have any.
At the last liquor store where petitioner was

store.

The clerk on duty testified during trial there was

no attempt at all made to rob the liquor store.

The petitioner

had not done anything except make that comment.
There was one witness who the robber come out of the
last liquor store.

Q

Mr. Klifcgaard.

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Let us for just a moment get back to this

threshold question we seem to have in this case.
Justice Brennan asked

your brother counsel about the

16
statement in your reply brief saying it was doubtful the State
17
Supreme Court could have granted a review even had it wanted to
18
in citing those two cases.

Do those cases really stand for?

19
A

Yes, sir, I am glad you asked the question.

20

Here is what they stand for.

These are cases in the

21

California District Court of Appeal where after its judgment
22

became final, the 90 days passed, the Court of Appeal modified
23
its opinion like the court did here, didn't modify the judgment
24
—- the judgment still stayed the same but it modified the
25
opinion.

59

]

And from the modification of the opinion there was

2

a petition to the California Supreme Court for a hearing and

3

here is what the California Supreme Court said, "It said a

A

Right.

Q

And we have set aside a judgment and remanded

it to the Court and so that started everything going again.
The judgment was vacated.
A

Yes, your Honor, but the judgment was still

basically the same as it had been in the case the whole time.
Q

Yes, but it had to be re-entered, didn't it?

A

Something had to be done to it.

It had to be

re-entered.
Under the California rules of appeal, Mr. Justice,
even had petitioner filed a petition, Rule 29 of the California
rules prohibits the California Supreme Court from reviewing
just on factual questions and under that rule the California
Supreme Court will not look behind the statement of facts or
60

1

the dealing of factual matters in the Court of Appeals in its

2

opinion.

Now that is not cited in any of the briefs but it is

It is Rule 29.

that the petitioner --A

I thought these cases ended the matter when the

California Supreme Court says as long as judgment remains the

same, if the opinion is modified, that doesn't start the time

a pretty clear question of law which you could have taken to
the California Supreme Court.
A

24

Well, you must remember, Mr. Justice, that this

time petitioner didn't have any lawyer.

And if you are going

to say to petitioner, "All right, you have to go back up and
down," then it becomes important to decide whether the petitioner
had a right to help him on that discretionary review.
Q

22
23

Yes, but if one of your arguments is whether or

not the standard used in terms of harmless error was used by the

But as an additional ground, there are these

You mean when you haven't got a lawyer, you

don't need to get the judgment of the highest court of the
State?

I am not saying that.

I am saying if petitioner

went to the highest court of the State,, the court denied him

You say that this judgment could not go to the

If I were a lawyer in California advising

petitioner at this time, I would say you did not have to go to
the California Supreme Court, because of the two cases I cited
and because of my knowledge of California rules, Rule 29,

MR. KLITGAARDs

Yes, every case involves that.

Let me just come back to Mr. Justice

Marshall's point.
Those two cases I cite in my brief, I think, on why

pointed up the whole heart of the matter.
Now, as to the argument on appeal, as to whether

d
>0

there should have been oral argument, the California statute

11

says that a California appellate court in a criminal case cannot

12

reverse a judgment unless it hears argument.
That is Section 1253 of the Penal Code.

13

Now counsel has informed me that in Douglas against

IS

20
21

California, which .is the, remember right to counsel case on
appeal, there was a remand to the DCA for further consideration
in that case, that after the DCA appointed counsel there was
another issue brought up by counsel at trial and then the
Supreme Court granted a hearing, California Supreme Court
granted a petition on the different issue on right of counsel
at trial.
But here you weren't having in this case different

22

23
24
25

issues coining up, you were still having the same issue each
time.
MR. O'BRIEN:

In reply to Mr. Justice White's

question, there is the ~~ the Douglas case is an example where

after this court remanded it to view in light of this decision,

the District Court of Appeal affirmed the case.

Penal Code Section 1253, Mr. Chief

It says, "The judgment may be affirmed if the
appellant failed to appear but can be reversed only after
argument though the respondent failed to appear."
Q

That is a pure question of State law we are not

concerned with.
A

Well the question you were concerned about was

the oral argument and there was some inquiries about the rules
and I just bring it up to be helpful.
MR. O'BRIEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, just in connection

with 1253, I would call that to the1. Court's attention for the
simple reason that it says may be affirmed if the appellant
fails to appear but can be reversed only after argument

25
66

though

t

the respondent fails to appear *
In other words, that is situation wherein the

2

respondent state in the criminal case may argue the case there
isn't the equivalent situation with regard to the appellant.
