Mr. Worrahoud t ?
FURTHER ARGUMENT OF GERRITT H. WORMHOUDT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WORMHOUDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
At the close of argument yesterday, I was trying to
establish that there has been in existence long before the
enactment of the Federal Rules a body of law derived from the
Acts of Congress and the interpreting decisions of this Court
which are applicable to the jurisdictional requirements for
Federal Courts, that body of law being independent of and,
indeed, I think, superior to the rules of practice that this
Court may have promulgated from time to time.
Because of that body of law, I think we have Rule 82
of the present Federal Rules.

Rule 82 provided initially that

none of the rules would be interpreted to extend or limit the
jurisdiction of Federal Courts,.
When the 1966 amendments were adopted, Rule 82 was
restated, making reference to admiralty, but continuing the
restrictive language I have just mentioned.
I submit that Rule 82 is there simply as a guide to
construction and an admonition that in interpreting the rules,

11

'I

shall not affect the jurisdictional standards of the lower

2

Federal Courts.

3

I would now direct the Court's attention to the nature

4

of the particular claims involved in this action.

5

mentioned yesterday that neither the District Court nor the

8

Court of Appeals attempted to categorize the claims involved

7

in this action as (b)(1),

8

S

I think X

(b)(2), or (b)(3) claims.

I don't think there can be any question, however,
that if this is a proper class action it must fall within the

10

terms of subdivision (b)(3) of amended Rule 23, which refers in

11

substance to cases presenting common questions of law or fact

12

where the predominating common question would take precedence

13

over any separate questions arising out of the claims.

14
15
1G

Q

Counsel, you do not question the proposition that

this action is a class action under amended Rule 23, do you,
at least — what is it — (b)(3)?
I do not, sir,

You don't quarrel about that!?

17

A

X am merely trying to ~

18

Q

Categorize it.

19

A

— categorise it under the rules.

20

X think in respondent's brief, reference is made to

2!

the fact that prior to the amendment, cases such as we have

22

here today, involving separate and distinct claims, really

23

amounted, under the prior rule, to a permissive joinder, en

24

masse, so to speak, under prior Rule 23.

25

That being the case, X do think, then, we must
12

consider, as Mr. Justice White was suggesting yesterday, the
logic of applying or abandoning the aggregation doctrine under
(b)(3) cases to the other rules which deal likewise with per­
missive joinder.
Subdivision (b)(3) certainly presents an instance of
permissive joinder.

It provides by its own terms that any party

may opt out upon receipt of notice that he has been included
within that class which is in litigation before the Court.

So

consequently, we still have the permissive feature involved in
at least Rule 23(b)(3) cases.
Q

I take it you would say that in an action by

stockholders in cases where they have similar claims, that if
three stockholders sued the saraa defendant and they all were
named plaintiffs, that each would have to have the necessary
jurisdictional amount.
A

Well, if 'Xour Honor please, at least under the

laws of Kansas, nearly all stockholder cases would have to be
filed as derivative suits.

There may be special instances of

departures from the derivative rule, but normally stockholders
actions present but a single action on behalf of the corporation
and consequently, there would not be a joinder problem under
the sitiaation you put.
Perhaps there may be in other State jurisdictions.
If so, I am not familiar with the problem that would be present.
Q

But you think in permissive joinder cases where
13

1

each one has a distinct claim, that the three parties are per™

2

mitted to join in one action suing the same defendant, that

3

each must have the jurisdictional amount.

4
5
S

A

I don't thirds there has ever been any question

about that, Your Honor.
Q

And the suggestion is here that — your claim is

7

that the other side suggests that all you have to do is to drop

8

out the other two names and sue as a class —

9

A

That is correct.

JO

Q

--- to avoid the same result.

11

A

And it seems to me also, along those lines, that

12

if aggregation has not been permitted under Rule 19 in an

n

nary permissive joinder case, where all the parties are before

14

the Court, they are identifiable, and certainly res adjudicata

15

would apply to any matters litigated where the parties were

16
17
13
19
20

21
22
23
24
25

ordi­

named, that in a situation where all the parties may not actually
be before the Court, there is even less reason to aggregate
their claims in order to satisfy the jurisdictional amount than
there would be in an ordinary permissive joinder situation.
Q

Even if they are bound by the judgment.

A

Yes, because I think the same principle is

volved in both situations.
Q

in­

They are all bound.

Well, let's take your case and let's suppose that

the plaintiff here lost.

Let’s suppose that some other user of

gas service brought a subsequent suit of exactly the same sort,
14

1

Would he be — would the doctrine of collateral estoppel by

2

that suit?

3

A

May I ask if you are assuming that the subse­

4

quent suit is filed by a person who was a named party in the

5

original action?

6

Q

No, no.

Not. a named party at all.

But this is

7

suit is ■— let's suppose that the present suit goes ahead to

8

judgment and the judgment runs cigainst the plaintiff here.

9

Another gas user situated in exactly the same position

10

brings a subsequent suit.

n

very useful way to work backwards to the nature of the action.

12

Would he be estopped?

13

That, as you know, is sometimes a

The suit was a matter of public record and he didn't

14

join in it.

15

didn't join in it and he brings subsequent suit.

IS
17
18
19

Let us assume he cculd have joined in it but he

A

May we also assume that ha did not out-file on

receipt of the notice that the suit had been filed?
Q

Well, then you are assuming that it is a class

action, aren't you?

20

A

Yes.

21

Q

So do you concede that this is a class action in

22

which,a compulsory class action, in which, in effect — the kind

23

of a class action in which joinder is compulsory in the sense

24

that if a person in the same situation does not join, he is

25

forever* barred?

15

1

A

Not on the facts of this case,

2

Q

He must be if you say that he is bound unless —

3

maybe I misunderstood you — he is bound unless he opts out.

4

Then this is not a permissive joinder case but it is true class

5

action.
A

6

Well. I might suggest it is a permissive mis­

7

joinder case, then, where you have the option to take yourself

8

out.

On the facts you put, Mr. Justice —
Q

9

I've never heard that term, but it has charm.

10

The fact of the matter is, this is pretty close to a true class

11

action, isn’t it* if it is not a true class action, this one?
Apart from how it is phrased, I don't recall how the

12

13

complaint was framed up.
A

14

I think in a traditional sense I would have to

15

disagree, that this is not a true class action.

IS

are separate and distinct and traditionally, at least, under

17

those circumstances, any member of the class would have had

13

perfect freedom, prior to the enactment of this rule, to liti­

19

gate where he pleases, when he pleases and —
Q

20

These claims

I am not talking about prior to the enactment of

2?

this rule.

22

dictional amount, but I take it that your argument does not

23

necessarily amount to a plea to us to hack away at the rule

24

itself.

25

You are addressing an argument to us on the juris­

A

That is correct.
16

1

Q

So let's take it under this rule.

Under this

rule,

4

rule contemplated as a class action.

I suggest to you that this is a —- there is a possi­

Well, I think within the terms of the rule 1

have no disagreement with your —
Q

So that if somebody doesn't opt out, he is

forever barred.

9

A

I think this is correct.

10

Q

Then the question is, do you or do you not

Vi

properly infer from those legal consequences a conclusion with

12

respect to the jurisdictional amount, whether you call it aggre­

13

gation or something else.

14

A

Am I right?

I think that is the question, and again, I may

15

be repetitious, but I would still take the position that you

16'

must consider the nature of the claims involved in order to

17

test jurisdiction.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Well, everybody here is claiming — the claim

here is exactly the same with respect to all members of a large
and definable group.

The only thing that differs is the amount

in the case of each claimant. Now, what more do you want for an
aggregation case, or whatever word you want to use?
If this is not a case in which you can put together
the total amount of the claim, could you state one to me, for­
getting the stockholders’ derivative action cases, which I think
17

<*
fi

you properly distinguished and which was involved in the pre­

2

ceding case which, however, was brought as a. class action?

3

Apart from that, can you give me any case in which there can

4

be a proper aggregation or pooling of amount?
A

5

6

tion under a trust indenture.

7

8
9

I think a good example would be a trustee situa­

Q

Well? that action would be brought by the trustee

A

Assuming that the trustee was somehow or other

alone.

10

derelict in his duty with respect to the preservation of the

11

trust property.

12

trust would have the right, on behalf of all the other members

13

who are beneficiaries, to attempt to enforce or employ —

14
15
16

Q

I would think then that any bexieficiary of the

It is either like a derivative, action or it is

like this action, isn't it?
'A

Yes.

There may be other categories where you

17

have a fund involved where first there may be undivided in­

18

terest involved in the fund.

19

third category, something in the nature of title suits.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

I would suggest that as a possible

That is the classic third category, isn't it,

under the —
A

I think so.

And there, as I mentioned, I don't

think you have any problem of aggregation because you only real! y
have a single claim.

It does affect many people, but the

claim is singular.
18

i

Q

Well, do you see anything inherently inconsistent

2

with saying that you cannot aggregate and yet that all members

3

of this particular class would be bound by the judgment?

4

5

A

No, 1 see nothing inherently inconsistent in that

if it were —
Q

S

Thera may be some reasons why you think they

7

should not be bound, but it doesn’t necessarily undermine your

8

position that there is no aggregation»
A

9

That is correct.

1 think we simply have a policy

10

of consideration here which derives from Congress in a prior

11

body of decisions of this Court which is, namely, to restrict

12

access to the lower Federal Courts, to rease their case load.

13

For that reason, we have a rule of construction which says in

14

so many words “Let’s not construe the rules to increase that

15

case load”
The Tenth Circuit Court conceded that prior to the

13
17

amendment of these rules, this case simply could not have been

18

filed.

19
20

21

22
23
24
25

The conclusion is that by virtue of the amendment, now

it can be, and I submit that consequently jurisdiction has been
large because it is now present where it was not before.
As a result, we are going to have considerably more
litigation in the Federal Courts of the most complicated kind
and the kind of litigation that can certainly be properly handle!
in State Courts, and I think both of these cases present good
.instances of that.
19

1

We have in this case a question of the legality of

2

the municipal ordinance involving a franchise tax collected by

3

a public utility which is subject to regulation by Kansas author­

4

ities»

5

from the so-called desirability or workability of the rules,

6

which override the Congressional policy, I submit, of easing

7

the workload on our lower Federal Courts.

8
9

There are just simply no policy reasons apparent , apart

I think at least in my district we can get a case
disposed of in half the time in our State Courts.

Thank you»

n

Q

12

13
14

Did I Understand you to say that your State

Courts procedurally allow for class actions of this type?
A

Yes, in Kansas we have the equivalent of the

former Rule 23.

15

Q

So-called spurious class action.

16

A

No, the entire former Rule 23, which included -—

17

Q

You pretty much adopted a counterpart of the

18
'19

20

Federal rules in Kansas, but haven't yet amended them.
A

That is correct.

So far as I know, there is no

consideration being given to amending them at the present time.

ARGUMENT OP ROBERT MARTIN, ESQ-

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MARTIN:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s

5

I think we have two platforms from which to look at

6

the question before the Court, the first one being the proper

7

effect and interpretation of amended Rule 23; and the second one

8

being whether there is any substance to the argument here that

9

the effect of the amended rule is to extend the jurisdiction of

to
11

Federal Courts unlawfully.
Now,

most of the questions that have occurred, or

12

that have been asked from the Bench in the preceding case and

13

in this Cctse really concern the first question: the proper

14

interpretation and application and the practical effect of

15

Rule 23 on class litigation, so I want to address myself to

IS

that aspect of what we had before first.

17

I am embarrassed to say that I have a somewhat dif­

18

ferent view of amended Rule 23 than seems to be the view adopted

19

by any of the three preceding counsel.

20

now amended, as an attempt to straighten out. and do away with

21

some terrible problems that confronted us in the practical appli

22

cation of former Rule 23.

23
24
25

I see Rule 23, as it is

Very briefly, what I am referring to is this:

Former

Rule 23 did have it.3 origin, as one of the counsel stated, in
the old equity rules.

But when Rule 23 was promulgated, it
21

1

appears from the history that Professor Moore undertook to

2

categorize the circumstances under which you could have a class

3

action, and he came up with the three categories which were

4

not recited in the rule

5

in subdivisions (a)CD, {2}, and (3) of true, hybrid and spur-

think you can find in the literature statements by writers to

13

the effect that this was a clear rule, in plain English, and
everybody could understand it»

those categories were going to work well, and they do work well
when you are talking about property rights, and they had some
historical basis.
If two people were joined together as plaintiffs to

piece of litigation.

You really had one

We had what we called "in rem" juris­

diction and all these things were familiar to lawyers and they
understood

them.
q

It wasn’t an aggregation? it was just one claim,

A

Yes, sir.

21

22

wasn’t it?
It was really aggregation of plain­

23
24

tiffs and not aggregation of claims at all.
Professor Moore attempted to apply that to class

25
22

1

actions.

2

when you are dealing with property or a fund? but class actions

3

very quickly became broader than that.

4

rights and all kinds of situations developed chiefly by modern

5

commerce that cried out for adjudication by class action.

6

I think that history demonstrates that it works well

There were all kinds of

It isn't a question of increasing case load; it is a

7

question of decreasing it,

8

gories beyond property rights, we got into trouble, and we got

9

into bad trouble.

10

When we tried to extend these cate­

Rule 23 left cases spread over our reports that

11

simply couldn't be rationalised or harmonized in certain areas,

12

one of them being the question of jurisdiction that we have

13

before us, both as to amount and as to diversity.

14

There was no problem about aggregation when you talked

IS

about a claim to try title where you had more than one party.

16

But when you got down to what Professor Moore termed, and the

17

committee termed, a "spurious" class action you had the litera­

18

ture which said this really isn't a class action at all? this

19

is a permissive joinder device.

20

Then you were face to face with the problem not only

21

as to jurisdictional amount, but as to whether or not inter­

22

veners had to show diversity.

23

Another area that we had which developed some terrible

24

law was in the effect of the judgment.

25

burden of my argument will be that those two are bound up.
23

As a matter of fact, the
If

1

you are going to bind the class with the judgment, then the

2

amount in controversy is the effect of that judgment on the

3

class, and that is the value that you have to look at.

4

Under old Rule 23, when we got down to the effect of

3

the judgment, we developed a set of laws which said that in true

6

class actions, those really involving property or something

7

directly related to it, all of the class was bound.

8

class cictions, they were bound, but to a lesser extent, and

9

under different circumstances, and frankly, there were so many

to

different decisions that I haven't been able to figure out when

tt

they are bound and when they are not in a hybrid class action.

12

in a spurious class action, the law is clear that no

In hybrid

That seen, 5

13

one in the class is bound except those who intervene.

14

somewhat reasonable until you carry it another step.

13

tice developed of starting a spurious class action.

16

members of the class who were aware of this anomaly would sit

17

on the outside and they would wait until the case was adjudi­

18

cated, or almost adjudicated, until it became clear that the

19

plaintiff was going to win, and then they would come in and

20

intervene and say, "We want the benefits of the decree."

21

The prac­
The other

But the problem was that it was a one-way interventioi

22

They could stay out and not be bound if the defendant won, and

23

they could come in and be bound if the plaintiff won.

24
23

Further than that, the courts quickly confronted them­
selves with this problem:

Here is what we call a class action.

11

is barred by the statute of limitations'’; whereas, the plain­

12

tiff, the original member of the class, his claim is not.
You can't reconcile these conflicting interests.

13
14

There were other problems that cropped up in trying to pigeon­

15

hole the class action.

16

us, and the Advisory Committee, in the framing of the original

17

rule, was to lead us down the same path as the old common law

18

pleaders.

19

Q

In effect, what Professor Moore did to

The original Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

20

in other rules, provided for joinder — joinder of parties and

21

joinder of causes of action — and basically there was very free

22

joinder, and still is.

23
24
25

If a so-called spurious class action is nothing more
nor less than something that covers permissive joinder, what
.would have been the point of putting it in there along with the
25

1
2

joinder rules?
A

Well,, that is what one wonders»

Personally, I

3

do not agree, from the standpoint of personal philosophy, that

4

it was only a permissive joinder device»

5

law, or at least everybody thought it was the law»

6

agree with that.

7

But that became the
X don't

I think it was intended to be something more, and what

8

I am saying is that at the present time, under amended Rule 23,

9

it is something more and it should be.

10

As X see it, the effect of amending Rule 23 — it

11

wasn't really an amendment? it was a complete redrafting — the

12

effect of that has been to eliminate just exactly the problem

13

that you mentioned, only now I don’t think we have any such

14

thing as a spurious class action.

15

any such thing as a hybrid class action.

16
17

I don't think we have now

X think that now, for the first time, and as it should
be, all class actions are true class actions.

18

Q

You do have (b) (1) , (b) (2) , (b) (3) .

19

A

Yes.

But (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b){3) cannot be

20

related to true, hybrid or spurious, either historically or in

21

the context of the rule.

22

What really has happened under amended Rule 23, and

23

the answer to counsel’s argument that the amended rule is going

24

to vastly increase the case burden of the Federal Courts, is the

25

rule itself

?

Rule 23, as now amended, or new Rule 23, as I will

2

call it, provides a very workable, precise, and careful descrip­

3

tion of what is and what is not a class action,

4

a little different treatment in terms of procedure given to a

5

class action in which the cohesive force of the class is a com­

S

mon question of lav; or fact in a common interest in relief, as

7

distinguished from that situation in which the cohesive force of

8

the class is a joint interest in property or a fund.
But it is a procedural difference, and nothing more.

10

It isn't a difference in substance, and it ought not to be.

Could just one member of this group bring his own

15
18

action if he wanted to?
A

He could in State Court.

There might be one —-

17

we have stipulated that we don't know of any, and I don't know

18

of any -- but I suspect that there are industrial users who

19

would have $10,000 and could bring one in Federal Court, but I

20

don't know that.

21

Q

Let's assume that two or three of them together

22

brought their own action, naming each as a party in the Federal

23

Court and the three of them together added up to $10,000.

24

didn't purport to bring a class action? they just —- the three

25

of us are suing.

It is a permissive joinder case.
27

They

I suppose

s

it is permissive joinder, isn't it?

2

A

It would be? yes, sir.

3

There is no aggregation there, is there?

Absolutely none.

And this is because of a statute that requires

It is, but the amount in controversy, even though

tiffs

in the same action, rather than separately numbered

10

cases, doesn't change the fact that the amount in controversy

11

truly is the individual claim of each one.
Q

12
13

But they say, "Well, yes, but we add up together

to $10,000."

14

A

It wouldn't make any difference.

IS

Q

But you think that one of them then could say

18

"Well, let’s two of you get out and I will bring a class action’ 2
A

17

18
19

to get out but, to take your example, one of them could say, or
all three of them could say, "We are not going to" ■—

20

22
23

24
25

Well, Mr. Justice, the two of them wouldn't have

Q

"We are just going to state our cause under

A

"We are going to state our cause under Rule 23

Rule 23.”

and we contend that this is, in fact, a Class action.”
If I. atey give you a long answer to that question ~~
Q

Well, if there are only three members of the
28

1

class, the three could still stay in and say, "We are suing as

2

a class action?"

3

A

I think 1 see what you are getting at.

If this

4

were a different suit, and there were three members of the class,

5

in theory you might argue that they could.

6
7

8
9
10

11
12

Q

You mean just by putting the Rule 23 lable on

it, I could?
A

well, no, because the rules of the court would

not apply the Rule 23 label -Q

It would have to be a larger number than three,

ancl the larger number can't be ascertained.
A

Yes, sir.

The answer to your question is that

13

it would be a very rare circumstance where that could conceivably

U

be a class action because one of the requirements is that the

15

number of the class has to be so large that it can't effectively

IS

be brought before the court.

17
18
19

Q

But in any event, the three of them could, in

your case, you think, where there are lots of gas users, un­
identifiable to a great extent.

They could bring a class action,,

20

A

Yes, sir.

21

Q

Even though they couldn't stay in the Federal

22
23
24
25

In my case, there are 18,000,

Court themselves if they just named themselves as plaintiffs.
A

Yes, sir; and the reason for that is that if three,

or five get together, or one comes in and says "This is a class
action and I want not only to adjudicate my rights, but the
29
f1

1

rights of the class as a whole/' then the changed procedure is

2

this:

3

of the identifiable members of the class and inform the members

4

of the class that this action has been brought as a class action

5

on their behalf, who the plaintiffs are, and that they will be

6

bound by the judgment unless they come in and option themselves

7

out? that they have the right to option themselves out? but

8

they also have the right to appear or not appear»

The Federal Court is then required to give notice to all

In other words, he must give a good, practicable

9
10

notice.

11

as quickly as possible to determine whether this properly is a

12

class action, and there are various factors he must consider.

13

Than he is required, under the new rule, to proceed

One of the things he must determine is that the class

14

is so numerous that class action is justified? that the plain­

15

tiffs , whether they are one or three, are in a position feiirly

16

to represent and present the interests of the class.

17

must consider as additional factors under a (b)(3) action that

18

the class action method is superior to any other available pro­

19

cedure for the adjudication of these claims.

20

He must also determine, if the case is to be maintained
as a class action, what the interest, is of the individuals who

22

are controlling the litigation.

23

other suits that are pending or any right on the part of any

25

j

Then he

21

24

j

He must take into account any

individuals to separately litigate their claims and any diffi­
culties in management of this class action.
30

It gives him precise standards, but broad discretion­

?.

ary power»

3

before he takes another step.

4

He must determine that at the beginning of the case,

Now, the burden of my argument really is that whether

S

it is a (b)(3) action, as counsel says this one is, and I agree,

6

we pleaded it as a (b)(3) action, but we could have pleaded it

7
8

under one of the other situations — if the court has made that j
I
determination, then it is a class action and if enough people

9

come in and decide that they want to be optioned out, that, of

10

course, should indicate to the court that it isn't properly a

11

class action; that there are reasons why individuals want to

12

adjudicate their own claims.

21

22
23
24
25

If two or three out of 18,000 would come in and opt
out, as Professor Kaplan puts it, that would be all right, but Q

If the three people we were talking about a while

ago have individual claims, when they name themselves as plain­
tiffs, I suppose they still have individual claims when they
name themselves as plaintiffs but also purport to be bringing a
class action.

If their claims are individual claims, why aren’t
the claims of all the unnamed members of the class also indivi­
dual claims?

They are individual claims, but because of Rule

23, you say that they can aggregate them.
A

I say, Mr. Justice, that, they are individual

claims until the court says "This is a proper class action."
31

1

At that minute» they

Q

A

He cannot dismiss the lawsuit» and that is the

answer to the jurisdictional question.

Everyone there is bound.

Justice Frankfurter in 1942 really —
Q

Well» so would the three people be bound if they

just sued for themselves.
A

Yes» they would, but the other ■—

Q

All three of the® would be bound by a judgment

if they just sued on their on behalf.

24

A

Yes» sir.

25

Q

And yet there is no aggregation.
32

1

A

Well, this would be true.

They would be bound

2

but the defendant would not be bound as to the other members of

3

the class, Mr. Justice, and the other members of the class woulc

4

not be bound, either.

3

Q

That is right.

But when you do purport to bring

6

in the unnamed parties, due purport to bring what you call a

7

class action, you say that because they are bound, therefore

8

it is one claim and, therefore, there is, in effect, aggregation.

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

And J6m just not sure that it necessarily follows

it

from the fact that from the consequence of binding that there

12

is aggregation.

13

A

I am not saying, Mr. Justice, that it necessarily

14

follows from that.

ment in favor of aggregation.

20
21

2£
23
24
25

I am not saying that that is the only argu­

I am saying that that is one of the strong arguments,
and historically that has really been the effect here.

When

the subject matter of the litigation is shown to have the value
|
of more than $10,000, there is no reason why a Federal Court
1
ought not to proceed.
It is a question of the procedure by which you reach
j
this ultimate objective.

You see, in the prior Rule 23, there
t

was no way by which, in a spurious class action, for example,
the court could ever force that decree off on someone else.
just could not ba done.

Therefore, it was not correct to say
33

It

1

that the amount in controversy was the amount

2

total rights of the class, because the rights of the class were

3

not to be affected.

4

litigated,

S
6

Q

that is, the

Only the rights of the actual parties

Certainly, Rule 23 in the form that it has, has

to be consistent with the statutory limit of $10,000, doesn't it?

7

A

Yes,sir; it does. And it is, in my judgment, sir.

8

Q

And yet the $10,000 limitation has been changed,

9

the amount has been changed, but the requirement of an amount

10

against the background of these older cases has been reenacted

Is

time and again, I suppose.

5

-

12

A

Well, it has, Mr. Justice, but this Court has

13

answered that question in a companion matter, which is the con-

14

siderationof the amendment of Buie 19 in the Provident National

15

Bank and Trust Company versus Eatterson.

16

down in January.

17
18

That decision came

X think the situation that Mr. Justice Harlan described
there, in the argument that he rejected, is really the argument

19

of the petitioner here, and the respondent in the prior case.

20

What they are really saying is that this whole concept of aggre­

21

gation in common property suits was all right, but in other suits

22

was wrong, not permissible; that that establishes a common law

23
24
25

which is inflexible, a substantive right, and no matter how we
change the rule, we can't get rid of these pigeonholes of true,
hybrid, and spurious.
34

1

That is not really so, and it ought not to be so.

a

Those cases were somewhat similar to the cases that Mr. Justice

3

Harlan described as the 19th Century joinder cases

4

is some of the same cases.
Q

5

Really, it

They don't establish —

Mr. Martin, let's get back to the language of

6

28 U.S.C. 1332, and the first paragraph of it, referring to the

7

$10,000 jurisdictional requirement refers to the matter in con-

8

troversy, that is to say, the matter in controversy has to ex­

9

ceed $10,000.

That is 1332(a)? is that right?

to

A

Yes, sir.

II

Q

I suppose your argument is that taking the amende a

12

Rule 23(a), assuming that this case comes within 23(a), then it

13

follows that the amount in controversy is the amount to which

14

all of the persons in the class would be entitled if they were

15

successful.

16

A

Yes,sir.

17

Q

And that is the matter in controversy, and, there­

18

I

fore, you say it satisfies 1332(a); is that right?

19

A

Yes sir; that is what I say.

20

Q

Nov/, one of the problems, if we go back to the

21

source and get underneath the gloss of the ages on this statute,

22

one of the problems comes in subsection (b).

23

there is reference to the denial of cost to the plaintiff where

24

he is finally adjudged,

25

originally

In subsection (b)

where the plaintiff who files the case

—■ the plaintiff who files the case originally in
35

1

the Federal Courts originally is finally adjudged to be entitled!

9

to recover less than the sum of $10,000,

3

Now, if that is to be taken as bearing upon the mean­

4

ing of the term '"matter in controversy/' then you have a real

5

problem, haven11 you?

6

A

Yes, sir? if you would say, Mr. Justice, that sub

7

section (b) really limits the general statement of the earlier

8

proposition that the District Courts have original jurisdiction

9

when the amount in controversy is $10,000.

10

Q

The question is whether it is the general amount
i

11

in controversy, or the amount in controversy measured solely by j

12

the claim of the plaintiff who originally files a case in the

13

Federal Court.

14
15
16

17

j

A

That is right, isn’t it?
That is really right, and subsection (b) that you

just read is the only thing in the rule or the statute that
gives any hint that it is the claim of a plaintiff.

The best

answer that I can give you — end I have considered this -— the

18

best answer that I can give you is that aggregation in some

19

circumstances, the ones I described, was allowed when that

20

statute was passed.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Exactly.

In other words, historically, despite

the language of subsection (b), aggregation has been permitted
in certain instances under the rules, and your argument is that
since 23(a) eliminates the distinction between true, spurious,
and hybrid class actions, and since, in your submission, all
36

1

class actions under 23(a) are now to be considered as true class

2

actions, therefore the line of cases permitting aggregation in

3

the case of true class actions should control here.

4

Q

Is that it?

Your Honor has made my submission on the second

5

point.

That is exactly what I intend to say.

0

should be the rule.

I think that

I believe that is the rule.

I want to fortify the proposition with the statement

7

8

that originally, a century ago — more than a century ago»* start}'

0

ing, I think, in 1843, when we first began to have these ques­

10

tions — the circumstances where aggregation was allowed were

11

really comparable in terms of commerce then and in terms of the

12

lack of complexity of litigation then as compared to now, they

13

were allowing aggregation where it should be allowed, where the

14

matter in controversy was $10,000 r~ or at that time $500 — or

15

more •

16

All I am saying is that procedures, like suits of

17

clothes, wear out and no longer fit the necessities of commerce

18

and human relations.

19

concept true, hybrid, and spurious, and that is what happened

20

with Rule 23 originally.

21

That is what has happened with the. old

It wore out in 25 years.

I think that the present rule that we have now, the

22

amended rule, is splendid, will solve the problem, and directs

23

itself to the problem.

24
25

There is no reason why, to get back to one of Mr.
Justice Marshall's questions yesterday, if the Court adopts the
37

1

view urged by the petitioner here, we are going to have a situa­

2

tion where the only people who can represent the class are those

3

who have $10,000 or more.

4

another man who has $10,000 even, that is. his claim, a stock­

S

holder

6

can’t start the action.

The other people — there might be

and we are saying to him, "You can51 come in.

You
i

You can’t represent the? class."

But to Mr. B, who has $10,000.01, "You can, the door

7
V/

8

of the court house is open to you."
The arbitrary limit is fine in private litigation.

9

It

10

must be made to limit litigation in Federal Courts.

11

in reality, when the man comas into court and ha presents, and

12

there is adjudicated not only his claim but a whole class of

13

claims, it doesn31 make any sense.

14

doesn’t afford the procedure that is necessary.
Q

15

But when,

It isn’t logical and it

Well, I assume that when the Judge holds this

16

investigation of the people who opt out, and all, if he finds

17

it is less than $10,000, then he will throw the case out* pre­

18

liminarily.

19

A

20
21

22
23
24
25

I

Yes, sir.

I believe that is quite correct.

One

of the things that he would find out when he makes the deter­
minations which must be made before the action can be maintainec,
on® of the things, of course, that he vrould find out is whether
we are dealing with a small class action, a piece of petty liti­
gation

where really the class
Q

That is the point that really worries me.
38

If

1

you go on the matter in controversy and the matter in contro­

2

versy is $100,000, but only $10,000 worth comes in and the rest

3

opt out, you get back to the point where the actual matter in

4

controversy is the actual amount that is being claimed, not the

S

amount that is in controversy.
A

s

That is my trouble.

I believe the answer to your question, Mr.

7

Justice, is that if you had that situation, a possible $100,000

8

class, the action is started by someone who has a smaller claim

9

than $10,000, and all of the members of the class, or a suf­

10

ficient number of members of the class to bring the claims down

11

below $10,000 opt out, then I think the court has lost jurisdic­

12

tion.

The court should dismiss the case for many reasons,

Q

That is the trouble.

What is the amount in con­

troversy — the amount that the corporation has, or the amount
that people claim?
A

The amount in controversy, Mr. Justice, is really

what Mr. Justice Frankfurter said it was in 1942.

He said that

in diversity actions, and he wasn't talking about class actions,
but this is my arguments

He said that in diversity actions, the

amount in controversy is measured not by the monetary result of
determining the principle involved, but by the pecuniary conse­
quences to those involved in the litigation.
Wow, to answer your question, the pecuniary consequent: ss
39

1

to those .involved in the litigation in a class action, once it

z

is determined that, it is a class action, consists of everybody

3

who is bound by it.

4

Q

The defendant has —

At least your claim is no worse than the average

5

diversity claim which claims $100,000 and then it two years

6

later settles it for $500«

7
0
9

A

My claim, I think, Your Honor, is a good deal

better than that, and it should be.
Q

Mr. Martin, we have been talking about the juris­

10

dictional amount ingredient of Federal diversity jurisdiction.

12

ingredient of diversity jurisdiction?

21

22
23
24

What if some members of the class are citizens.of the
same State as the defendant and they don’t opt out.

Does that

defeat the diversity jurisdiction?
A

No, sir? in my view it does not affect the

diversity jurisdiction.
under old Rule 23.

Of course, this was one of the anomalies

We were saying that spurious class actions

were not really Class actions, and yet we were allowing people
'
to come in who couldn't show diversity.
were binding people who had no diversity.
they couldn’t litigate.

In hybrid actions, we
They were bound and

They couldn't really bring the action

and they couldn't really litigate.
Q

What do you say the situation is now, under

new Rule 23.
25
40

1

A

I would say that the situation now is that if

2

the original plaintiffs show diversity of citizenship, then any­

3

one who doesn't opt out can benefit himself from the decree and

4

is bound by it regardless of his citizenship.

5

6
7

8

Q

And the existence of those people doesn't defeat

diversity, in your submission.
A

No, sir.

In my view, it does not, and it really

didn't under old Rule 23.

9

Q

There are decisions to that effect, are there?

10

A

Yes, sir.
