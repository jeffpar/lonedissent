ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE M. LSPPSRT, ESQ.»
ON BEHALF' OF PETITIONERS
MR. LEPPERTs

Mr. Chief Justice* Your Honors,

Associate Justices, I represent the three petitioners in this
case who were convicted in a marijuana prosecution, which
Petitioner Skinner received ten years, Gueldner sixteen years,
and Charbonnet, the Negro defendant,, received fifty years.
Although we are talking about strictly legal features here,
it is necessary to present some of the highlights of the facts.
Mr. Skinner, who received ten years, was never shown to
have been a user or an addict or a seller or a vendor or a
pusher of narcotics in any way.

He engaged in a — he was

successfully engaged in two second-hand automobile places in
New Orleans, and it was admitted by the narcotics agent that
they undertook initially to make a case against one of his
employees; they were not after Skinner at all.

And failing
|

in that they finally built a case against him, along with
Gueldner, his salesman, and Charbonnet, who is alleged to be
the pusher.
Now, the indictment information charged a single transactio
3-

-

with two counts, on May 21,

1965, a sale of about $10 worth

of marijuana cigarettes and possession of the same cigarettes,.
The manner in which Sdinner became involved in this is set
forth clearly in the preliminary hearing and in the trial,
and the merits.

It amounted to a plea of entrapment, but we

are not urging that because that is a factual issue, but it is
necessary to understand this.
The undercover agent, Fullington, had gotten as a cover
job the position of finance manager of a company which said
yes or no on the loans used by Mr. Skinner in his business.
He ingratiated himself with Mr. Skinner, he went out to the
race track with him, got up to put up money for bets and
finally, whan he had gotten that far in his confidence, he
informed him that he wanted to get seme marijuana for a
friend of his and it was set up, according to the state's
testimony, to be delivered on the night of May 21, at which
time it allegedly took place on the lot, on Skinner's lot.
Then, under the Louisiana system evidence, which is very
broad, the state

was allowed to bring in another transaction

on May 28, involving another $13 worth of marijuana, %«;hich
allegedly took place on the same lot, through a meeting with
Charbonnet set up in the same way.
Q

Between the same parties?

ft

Yes, sir.

Now, under this Louisiana system evidence

which was allowed to be brought in, they were also permitted

Skinner and Gueldner hear it, it is our position that those
motions would have been a real hearing had this man been
there,

The record shows that the state officers were inter­

viewing this man in jail, trying to get a statement out of
him, obviously trying to get him to turn state’s evidence.
Wte were not representing him, we couldn't talk to him.
For all we knew, he might have been state's evidence.

And

the most significant thing that when we came to the trial
this is where they were going to hit us right between the yes
for the first time they come in with this completely unre­
lated heroin transaction in which Charbonnet alone was in­
volved with Hebert, the agent.

So we contend that that alone

was really prejudicial, and, moreover, if this was a part of
the trial, if this preliminary evidence had heard evidence for
the trial, which affects the three co-defendants, we were
entitled to have Charbonnet there and we might have found out
something about it, because the court said that he was going
to consider all of that evidence in connection with those
petitions, so it was exploratory.

minutes for rebuttal -■» the problem of the all-night session

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUISE KORNS

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MRS. KORNS;

Mr. Chief Justice and members of the

Court, before beginning argument, I would like to inquire of
the Court, is the Court interested in this third point on
13-

-

which it granted certiorari,

the conspiracy charge to the jury,

or is this Court interested only in the two points which
petitioners have briefed?
When this Court granted certiorari,

three points were

presented to this Court as allegations of error in the Court
below.

One of them was that the trial judge charged the jury

in this case on the law of conspiracy, although conspiracy was
not commonly charged in the bill of information.
Now, although petitioners urged this strongly in their
application for certiorari,

in their brief in this Court they

don't brief this point, they say they don’t think this Court
is interested in it.

Now, we brief it very strongly.

How­

ever, if this Court is not interested in it, naturally,
Louisiana will not argue it.
Q

well,

A

Very well, Your Honor,

the points,

I think you had better state your case.
I will answer all three of

then.

As far as the facts of the case go,
recapitulate what Mr. Lepperfc said,

I will just briefly

that this charge runs out

of a May 21 sale of heroin on Skinner 's Motor Mart to state
undercover agent Ben Fullington.

Undercover agent Fullington

testified that he went to Skinner's Motor Mart that day, met
Skinner and Gueldner,

told them he was interested in getting

some marijuana,

said either Gueldner or Skinner placed a

telephone call,

told the undercover agent he could have the
-

14-

marijuana later that day,

Fullingten testified that he re­

turned to the motor lot around 8s00 that evening, was intro­
duced by either Skinner or Gueldner to Charbonnet, the third
accused in this case, that Charbonnet told the agent "the
stuffy" as they call the marijuana, "is in that Lincoln parked
on the lot," that Fullingten went and got a matchbox of
marijuana out of the Lincoln, paid Charbonnet $20.
Now, a week later, on the 28th of May, undercover agent
Russell Hebert, who was working in close collaboration with
Ben Fullingten on this case -- the testimony shows that this
week later,

that Gueldner phoned Russell Hebert and told him

that the connection that he had spoken to him about was at the
lot and would sell him marijuana, that Russell Eebert went to
the lot and was introduced to Charbonnet on this date a week
later, that Charbonnet took him into the office, sold him
nine marijuana cigarettes,, yet he also testified that he had
told -- Hebert also testified that he told Gueldner a day ©r
so before this meeting that he was interested in contacts with
selling either heroin ©r marijuana.
On this second date, May 28, after Charbonnet had sold
Hebert the nine marijuana cigarettes in the office at the
motor lot, he said "how about some heroin," and Charbonnet
said,, "I will get you some.

Let's get in my car."

They went

Charbonnet obtained some heroin which he sold to Gueldner,

During that six-month period the court appointed three

Mr. Link concedes in his motion that he filed later

-

that it was because of illness -- in fact,, one of them died,
Mr. Bently Byrnes, who was a prominent lawyer.

I don't know

Mr. Monie’s full name myself, personally, but 1 do know that
Mr. Bently Byrnes and Mr. Bernard Burk, a competent lawyer
who take care of their clients, the allegation is that they
were sick.

There is nothing in the record to show they were

not sick.
Q

Mrs. Korns, is there anything in the record to show

that Charbonnet waived his right to be at these hearings?
A

No, sir, there is nothing, Your Honor, but his posi­

tion is ~Q

But the judge said "you come back," and then com­

mitted him to jail?
A

After doing this, Mr. Justice, Charbonnet had a

lawyer all of that time, but because of illness these lawyers
could not, did not file pleadings on his behalf,
Skinner and Gueldner notify

nor did

Charbonnet or his lawyers that

they had filed these motions.
Now, why don’t Louisiana concede that it would have been
better if Charbonnet had been present at these pretrial hear­
ings on Skinner and Gueldner?

There is no doubt about it.

Our contention is if this Court should give Charbonnet a new
trial because of his absence

from these motions, he would be

in no better position than the trial judge placed him in at this
*
trial, for this reason;
17-

-

These hearings were held on behalf of Skinner and Gueldner.
Before the trial* sixty days before the trial, Charbonnet en­
gaged Mr. Link to represent birr.

Mr. Link went into court at

this time and filed a motion, set out on page 11 of Louisiana's
briefs a written notice in which Mr. Link said -- pointed out
t© the Court that because of illness the three lawyers whom
the Court had appointed to represent Charbonnet had been unable
to do anything for him, therefore, this motion reads,
permission is asked that this order of the Court to permit
Charbonnet's attorney, Mr. Link, to determine whether if neces­
sary fc© file supplemental motions on Charbonnet's behalf, and
a minimum of thirty days be granted in order for defense counsel
to properly study and evaluate the record already taken in these
matters in order to file such pleadings as may be necessary on
behalf of your defendant.

And he asked the Court to enable

him, to do justice to Charbonnet, to furnish him with the
transcripts ©f all p3.eadings and testimony which had been taken
in the case.

That very day the trial judge ordered the Court

Reporter to furnish Mr. Link with the whole

the entire

transcript of the proceedings that had gone on before.

He

ordered the trial delayed for at least thirty days to permit
Mr. Charbonnet"s attorney, Mr. Link, to file pleadings on
behalf of Charbonnet.
In fact, the trial was delayed sixty days, because con­
tinuances were asked for after that.
18-

-

1

So Mr. Link had all of

the transcripts ©f the testimony, all ©£ the motions.
not one single thing ©n behalf of Charbonnet.

He filed

As a matter of

fact, he did two things which shew clearly that he didn't think
his client had been -- in fact, three things -- and that he
sort of adopted the proceedings and said that they were on the
basis that Charbonnefe's life had been fully protected.

These

are the things he did:
On the first day of trial, Mr. Link moved -- and the record
will show this — as the trial was about to proceed, Mr. Link
asked the Court that all motions previously filed and all bills
of exceptions reserved be allowed to include his client,
Charbonnet.

The Court ordered it to be.

Anyway, under Louisians

law, joint defendants, when one reserves the bill they auto­
matically -- he asked all of these motions to be attributed t©
Charbonnet, and the Court ordered it done.
Moreover, as Your Honors will see in the written bills
themselves, the five written bills which were reserved t:o the
overruling of these motions, all recite

during the trial of

this case Skinner, Gueidner and Charbonnet file motion to
quash, motion for a preliminary hearing, which overruled and
we reserved these bills.
Q

Mrs. Korns, I missed something that you said there.

Did you say that under Illinois law, when one joint defendant
files a motion ~~

Q

when one joint defendant

files a motion, that is considered as if it were filed -A

Not motion, Your Honor, bill of exceptions*

Q

It applies only to a bill of exceptions?

A

Yes*

But Mr» Link: here adopted all of the motions

and failed to file any ©f his own, never objected before trial
that his client had been in any way prejudiced, in fact had
not when he had been given all ©f this stuff; not only that,
he used the transcript of the pretrial proceedings t© attempt
to impeach witnesses at the trial»
Now, Louisiana’s position is this;

It was too bad that

Charbonnet was not at those preliminary hearings, we concede
that»

But unless this Court is going t© hold that double

jeopardy has set in and Charbonnet can never, never be tried
because of this mishap, then how can Charbonnet be put in a
better position if this Court gives him a new trial than he
was already in, bees use he had the transcript of the proceed»
ing3, all ©f the pleadings, he was given sixty days t© file
any motions of his own, he adopted these pleadings as his own,
he used the transcripts at the trial to cross-examine the
witnesses*

The two witnesses who appeared at these pretrial

hearings, Russell Hebert and Fullington, appeared again in
the trial of the case — so we don't have the Pointer situation

the only two witnesses v;h© did appear at the preliminary

hearings appeared afc the trial* was cross-examined by Mr. Link,
using the testimony of pretrial to try fc© impeach them.

So,

Louisiana, as I said before and will say for the last time,
if this Court should give Charbonnefc a new trial because of
his absence* and unfortunately we concede it,

from these pre­

liminary hearings, after the trial judge did everything in his
power fc© repair the damage, and Mr. Link never before trial
complained that his client was injured, than Louisiana doesn't
see how he can be helped any further unless this Court says
that double jeopardy has set in and we can never try this man.
And X will skip any further argument on that point unless some
of the members of this Court would like a further discussion
of it,

that particular point.

Q

Did the Louisiana Court say anything about this point?

A

Yes,

they said that they didn't see how Charbonnefc

had been damaged by this point, beea use these motions were
filed.

I will tell you, Your Honors, a few more things that

are on my mind since I said I had finished arguing.
There was a motion t© suppress filed, and I concede that
if this motion to suppress had been a valid motion,

it would

be a problem here, but it turned out although a search warrant
was sworn out in this case and the motion to suppress was
based on the search warrant, as a matter of fact the motion
t© suppress fell flat on its face because it became immediately
clear after a couple of minutes ©f the motion to suppress that

You see, the

There was nothing to suppress.

motion t© suppress had been filed in the case involving the

whole argument was that they x^eren't able to be effective
counsel, and our whole argument was that the record shows they
were effective counsel and we can’t see how counsel could -Q

Didn’t the judge have some trouble here?

He seems

to have confused this case with another one, at least the
charge he made wasn't relevant t© this case,
A

Wall, let's get on to the third point,

Q

Is that the fact?

A

No, it is not at all the fact.

As a matter of fact,

defense would like you to think that the judge was confused,
«33»
I

i

but the judge wasn't at all confused»

As a matter of fact*

if he hadn’t charged the jury on the law of conspiracy, the
accused would have been prejudiced for this reason:

These

three men were jointly charged with sale and possession of
marijuana»

Mow, the actual delivery of the marijuana to the

undercover agent took place just by Charbonnet.

Although

Skinner and Gueldner were on the lot and introduced the under­
cover agents t© Charfoon.net, they i*;are not there when the
marijuana was actually handed t© them.

Therefore, during the

trial of the case, Mr. Gill objected when Agent Fullington
and Agent Hebert were testifying as to how they bought the
marijuana from Cfoarfeonnet.

Mr. Gill objected, “Your Honor,

this act took place out of the presence of my clients."

Well,

saying this is a good argument, if there is just one defendant
being tried because, as Your Honors know, you can only intro­
duce against them the two statements or acts that were dona
in their presence.

But the exception to this rule, and they

recognize this exception in all jurisdictions, is that if a
conspiracy is involved in the case you can — and you can
introduce acts of any of the conspirators.

And that the jury

was advised that a conspiracy exists, is imputable to every­
body.

In other words, three people could decide to murder or

rob, one person could stay home all the time and the other
person go out and do it.

If you could prove that they con­

spired to do this, the person who stayed home would be just
34-

-

as guilty as the murderer, as the person who went and did the
murder „
So in the instant case, the trial judge allowed in this
evidence acts which took place out of Skinner's and Gueldner's
presence, allowed it in because the State, the judge ruled,
had made a prirna facie showing of conspiracy, that a conspiracy
existed between these three accused»
Now, when the trial judge came to charge the jury, he
told them very succinctly —
Q

Finish your little statement, Mrs „ Korns, please.

A

Yes --- that he told the jury, he told them about the

law of conspiracy, and then he said — it is set out on page
f 28 of Louisiana’s brief — "Unless you are satisfied that a
conspiracy has been established I charge you that the acts
and declarations of one of the parties to the alleged conspiracy
do not bind the other,"

Therefore, the State feels that he was

protect -™ in fact the State knows —■ that he was protecting
the rights of Skinner and Gue jdraer when h® told them this,
because if he hadn't told the jury this, it would have been
the trial judge who would have decided that a conspiracy ex­
isted.

The trial judge would then have allowed evidence of

the act out of the presence of Skinner and Guelner in and it
would not have left it up to the jury whether to impute these
acts to Skinner and Gueldner or not.
Q

No conspiracy was charged, was there?

ment.

Here is the whole disposition of that major argu­

The Court saidt

12

"It is true that the minutes of court must show that the

13

accused was present at every important stage of the trial for

14

a felony, from the moment of his arraignment to the sentence,,1’

15

citing a number of State cases.

16

But, if stated simpler, if defendant Charbonnet pleaded

17

not guilty and was thereafter represented by counsel -- well,

18

he was represented only in the sense that he had one on paper

19

who never showed up for a period of — she was correct, it

20

wasn't a whole year, it was about seven months — seven months,

21

he was represented on paper only.

Continuing with this z

"His counsel had not filed a motion and it is our conclu*

23

sion that the inclusion was not imperative that he be present

at the trial when a motion to suppress and dismiss, filed by

the defendants Skinner and Gueldner.

Charbonnet was neither

prejudiced nor in violation of his constitutional rights,"
They didn’t even go into the question of whether this is
part of the trial.
Q

Was any evidence offered that was taken in a search

which was —
A

It was extended, Mr. Justice Black, in connection

with a motion for preliminary examination which under law
could have been used at the trial,
Q

I understood the lady today that there was no —

the search did not get anything and nothing resulted,
A

EJo, that was withdrawn.

That was withdrawn.

But

there were between forty-five and fifty pages of testimony on
the motion for a preliminary hearing and the motion for pre­
liminary examination and a bill of particulars.

There was ex­

tensive evidence ©n it.
Q

But none of it was ever offered at the trial?

A

No,

no evidence was offered,, but I am saying that

the motion -Q

Yes,, but none of the testimony that was taken at

those hearings was offered at the trial?
A

Except insofar as it was repeated, no, it was not

offered as such, no, sir.

Mow, in conclusion I want to give

you the climate of this business of why we had to work that
late at night,
Mr. Gill, in his motion for a new trial -- and it is all
41-

-

in the medical testimony -- he pointed out -- the record, 331,
Volume 2 -- that he was able to work normal hours, and he had
just finished a case that went four hours before Judge Cox,
the one who succeeded the first judge»

And the trial judge

say, “You are trying it with an old man who doesn’t have
anything*"

And a moment later he declared, record 331,

"1

succeeded a man you tried a case with, and his docket was in
terrible shape*

I cleared up the backlog he left.

The only

way I could do it is because I force lawyers to try cases,
defense and state.

That is the only wa judge is going to

stay up on his docket."
Q

Isn’t this a pretty good philosophy

A

Yes, sir.

x*

Q

— in this day when all the courts are congested?

A

Yes, sir.

Wa replied to that that there are limits

and we stated on page 67 of our brief to the State Supreme
Court, "The judicial docket which moves along blindly and
inexorably as an assembly line may put out a body of ©ddely
shaped judicial products."
Q

That is a good sentence.

A

And that is what we think we have here.

Q

Incidentally, I notice, as I look at the calendar,

this is on a Monday.

The trial was on Monday and Tuesday.

A

Sir?

Q

The trial days were Monday and Tuesday, I think.

»

I think that is correct
Q

Wsll, X suppose a judge would have a rather large

calendar on a Monday, wouldn't he, to dispose of before come
Friday?
A

Yes* sir, but the record doesn't show any reason to

move -- and as far as his previous continuances,

the record is

bare when you tie in with this previous matter»

It is merely

a supposition that Mr, Gill got a previous continuance.
were several that got them.

There

One of them was the State when

they amended their bill.
THE CLERK:

The Court is not* adjourned until to­

morrow at 10:00 o'clock.
(Whereupon, at the conclusion of the above-entitled
case, the Court was adjourned,)
