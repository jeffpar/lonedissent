Mr. Karpatkin.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KARPATKIN;

S
9

Counsel are present.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court c
The essential question of this case concerns the
right of a convicted serviceman to a meaningful appeal.
And more specifically it concerns the power of the

13

military commander to order the immediate confinement of a

14

serviceman convicted by general Court Martial and sentenced to

15

a bad conduct dismissal from the service or confinement to one

16

year or more and entitled thereby to certain valuable appellate :

17

rights to order his immediate confinement

18

the explicit provision of Article 71(c) of the Uniform Code of

IS

Military Justice which prohibits execution of such sentences

20

prior to the completion of the military appellate review.

j

notwithstanding
i*

}

21

Under the existing practice of confinement pending

22

completion of appellate review the entire sentence may be

23

served, prior to final appellate action and the guaranteed right

24

of appeal from serious convictions in the military will be

25

|j
rendered meaningless.

\

2

1

The military and the Government assert this power

2

on the basis of an overstrained conceptual distinction between

3

confinement pending completion of review and confinement after

4

final approval of sentence»

5

This right is asserted further in violation of

6

military law without regard to whether or not confinement is

7

necessary to insure the prisoner's presence after completion of

8

appellate review.

This is a habeas corpus case and it presents the
question of the power to confine a military prisoner prior to
the completion of military review in two contexts.
First, the power to confine him at the United States
disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a maximum
security institution.
And, second, the power to confine in a unique status
of confinement at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, which was
especially devised for petitioner after an order attempting
to transfer him for confinement to Leavenworth was declared
unlawful by the district judge in New Mexico.
There is, however, a threshold question of habeas
corpus jurisdiction raised by the Tenth Circuit's reversal of
District Court on grounds of alleged failure to exhaust all
military remedies.
After the decision of the Tenth Circuit when certiorari
application was pending in this court, an application was made
3

I

to the Circuit justice for releasing from confinement pending

z

certiorari.

3

further application was made to Mr. Justice Douglas and it

4

was granted on December 24«. 1968«,

5

It was denied first by the Circtait justice and

In his order granting the application for release from

6

confinement, pending certiorari, Mr. Justice Douglas specified

7

two issues related to exhaustion.

&
3

First, whether the doctrine of exhaustion of military
remedies applies whether habeas corpus petitioner doss not

10

challenge any purported error in the court martial proceedings

U

themselves, but rather 'whether the question, where the question

12

is whether the court martial convening authority, in this

BP.

case the Respondent, General Bond, acted beyond his jurisdic­
tion in attempting to order confinement prior to the completion
of military appellate review in violation of Article 71(c) UCMJ.
Also specified by Mr. Justice Douglas in his opinion
is the question of the respective scope of review by the
Court of Military Appeals in the Federal Courts on military
habeas corpus applications of this nature.
It is necessary to state the facts a bit, and may it
please the Court, in order to indicate the dimensions of the
problems involved in this case.
Petitioner, a Captain in the Air Force, was convicted

23
by a general court martial at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico,
24
on March 8, 1968, for violation of Article 90 of the UCMJ.
25

4

'it

He was accused and convicted of willful disobedience

>*

of a lawful order.

3

was that he fly an instructional mission with a student pilot

4

being trained for combat duty in Vietnam,

S

7

U

12
13

14

The order he was convicted of violating

The principal defense which was sought to be raised
at the general court martial was that he had previously applied
for classification as a Conscientious Objector and either
separation from the Service ox" reassignment to duties not
inconsistent with his conscience.
That his application was denied because of an error
of law on the part of the Secretary of the Air Force and those
officers acting in the name of the Air Force,

The error which

was alleged was the Secretary's denial of the claim because
Capta:.n Noyd was a selective Conscientious Objector and not
i
a universal pacifist,

15

16

I must observe that even though this issue bisn't
before the Court that this is not a wholly frivolous contention

17
as demonstrated by the recent decision of Judge Wyczanski,

18
19

an assistant case in the District of Massachusetts, which I

I
*
I!
5

understand the Solicitor General is taking a direct appeal on

20
to this Court,

21
However, Petitioner was unable to raise that defense

22
at his general court martial.

The law officer held that the

23

5

general court martial was without jurisdiction and the Board of

24
Review which heard the first appeal from the conviction
23

I
:
I
f

I

specifically held that only Federal Courts had jurisdiction»

2.

The case is now pending in the Court of Military Appeals and

3

will be argued some time next month»
The criminal proceedings at the general court martial

4
5

and the futile attempt to appeal therefrom were Captain Noyd9 s

8

second unsuccessful attempt to obtain judicial review on

7

whether the Secretary3s denial of his conscientious objector

B

application was lawful or unlawful»
The prior attempt was in the case of Noyd against

9
10

McNamara where the District Coiirt of Colorado in the Tenth

11

Circuit held without reaching the merits that they were juris-

12

dictionally barred from ruling because again the doctrine of

13

exhaustion of military remedies barred them they so held*

14

and they stated further and the Government so argued before

15

those courts, that whether the application for conscientious

16

objection was rightfully or wrongfully denied could not be
':|

17

judicially reviewed in the civil courts but only as a defense

18

to a court martial»

an order end raising the issue of wrongful denial.

was denied by this Court in Noyd against McNamara in December
of 1967»
Thus, the civilian courts directed petitioner to
raise his defense in the military courts and the military
courts said in turn that only the civilian' courts had

forfeiture of all paying allowances and one year's confinement

On that day, the day the sentence was imposed,

petitioner was ordered to immediate confinement at quarters

As a Senior Captain,
!'i

removed after he filed the C.O, application, he was entitled
to reasonably comfortable officers residence on base with wife
and two infant children.
On May 10, 1968, the convening authority of the
general court martial, the respondent General Bond, approved
the court martial findings and sentence and ordered petitioner
I
confined at the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, pending the completion of appellate review.
The appendix contains in full general court martial
Order No» 13 which sets forth the convening authority's action.

It wasn’t his immediate commander, but

it was -the first commander who had general court martial

General Bond.

A habeas corpus petition was filed immediately in

6

to the habeas corpus petition, no request for additional time

9

Judge Payne acted promptly,

It was argued and presented purely as a question of
law.

It was a hearing within a matter of days, briefs and

10

oral argument, decision from the bench on May 23rd, written

11

opinion on May 24th, which is sat forth in the appendix to

12

the effect that Article 71(c) was violated by the attempted

13

confinement of petitioner at the Disciplinary Barracks at

14

Fort Leavenworth.

15

However, Judge Payne declined to order complete

13

release from petitioner's then status of arrest in his residence.

17

Both sides appealed to the Tenth Circuit.

18

Early in June of 1968, while the appeal was pending,

19

petitioner and his family were evicted from their residence

20

and special conditions of confinement were set up for petitioner.

21

He was. ordered to move to a room specially prepared for him

22
23

in the: Visiting Officers Quarters and conditions were estab1i
listed which I can best characterize as being & hybrid, having

24

certain characteristics of arrest, certain characteristics

25

of imprisonment and certain characteristics of solitary
confinement.

8

1

It was arrest in that or at least it resembled
i

a

arrest in that there was no lock on the door and he was allowed

3

use of the telephone and TV set at his own expense»

4

imprisonment in that all of his activities were strictly

3

regulated, he was subject to surveillance by Air Force

e

Security Police, permitted to leave his room for meals, chapel,

7

laundry, but only under conditions similar to those whereby a

8

penitentiary prisoner could leave his cell to obtain these

9

services elsewhere in the penitentiary complex»

It was

10

However, it also had certain attributes of solitary

11

confinement in that posted on his door was a. huge sign, "Room

12

Off Limits to Military Personnel«"

13

have exercise except for 1-1/2 hours per week with an approved

14

officer and denied the opportunity of contact with other

15

human beings, fellow prisoners or otherwise, which even

16

inmates in the Disciplinary Barracks have unless they are in

1?

solitary confinement.

18

He was not permitted to

f

This unique hybrid status continued from June of

19

19S8 to December 24, 1968, when he was ordered released from

20

confinement by order of Mr, Justice Douglas,

21

22
23

24
25

In the interim, the Board of Review affirmed the

i
S

court martial conviction and the Tenth Circuit reversed the
District Court of New Mexico in this habeas corpus proceeding.
The Tenth Circuit did not consider the merits, we respectfully
suggest by the citation of cases in footnote 4 of its opinion

I

\

which is printed in the appendix,,

2

petitioner0s position that 71(c) was violated„

3

Circuit heldff however, that it was jurisdictionally barred

4

from ruling once again because of the doctrine of exhaustion

5

of military remedies.

It appears to agree with
The Tenth

Since petitioner is in confinement he is entitled

6
7

under Mr Force Regulations to credit for good time.

8

A one-year sentence less g'cod time was computed to expire on

9

the 26th of December, 1968.

Mr. Justice, the sentence does indeed begin to

Apparently it took a special ruling from

the Judge Advocate General in this case to decide -that Captain
Noyd was entitled to good time credit.

And I believe the

Government so states in its brief.
We contend —

So the answer is yes?

Yes, yes, of course.

will take on that.

Q

We take the position, of course, that he

I understand the Government in the brief not

5

only take that position but concede that position and urge

6

that, position.

7

A

Yes, sir.

8

Q

Whether or not he is confined, so the fact he

9
10

was confined has nothing to do with the computation of his
good time.
A

11

All that I can say to that, your Honor, is that

12

there appears to be nothing specific in Air Force Regulations

13

on that point and it required a specific ruling from the

'14

I
Judge Advocate General.

*
I

Consequently, because of the possibility that the

15
16

sentence would expire with good time allowance prior to this

17

Court's action on the certiorari petition, it was accompanied

10

by a release application to avoid the possibility of mootness.
I stated before Mr. Justice Douglas on December 24,

19

20

19S8 granted the application.
In response to the certiorari petition, however, the

21

22
23
24
25

[

Government submitted a memorandum suggesting mootness and
then a further supplemental memorandum further arguing mootness
and said nothing whatsoever in opposition to the merits of
the case.
11

1

However,, on January 20, 1969, certiorari was granted

2

and Mr, Justice Douglas9 stay order was specifically continued

*p

by this court.
Mow, it is hard to tell if the Government

4

tinuing to seriously press its mootness.
(i

7/

It

It

Douglas was without power to interrupt the termination of the
sentence.
Mow apparently it concedes that Mr. Justice Douglas
had the power, but it argues that it is unclear whether Mr.
Justice Douglas intended to interrupt the sentence.
With all due respect I suggest that argument is

12
13
'i 4

It first seemed to

argue in the tv;o memorandums which were submitted and Mr. Justic: 6»

0
10

is con­

fatuous.

Petitioner's concern about mootness was made very,

very clear in the release applications presented first to
Mr. Justice White and later to Mr, Justice Douglas and obviously

15
18

the members of the Court were aware of it.
Now in the brief presented in this court the

17
Government's position is somewhat schisophrenic at on© place
18

saying that it is moot and the other place saying maybe it
IS
20

isn’t moot, and then finally concluding saying it is all up
to what Mr. Justice Douglas

intended and then there is a

21
reference to the decision of this court in Xow^ against

22
Philadelphia Marine Trade which reversed a contempt order
23

because in accordance with the decision of this court it was
24
unintelligible, too vague to be understood and defies
2,5

comprehension.

12

,

I respectfully suggest that this characterisation

A

o,

of Mr* Justice Douglas8 order by the Government is completely

3

uncalled for»

4

If I may reach the preliminary question in this case*

5

the question of exhaustion of military remedies, the Court of

€

Appeals denied relief we hold improperly on grounds of the

7

alleged failure to exhaust military remedies»

The decision of the Tenth Circuit was based on one

decision of this Court, Gusik against Schilder in 1950.

I

have not been able to find a single instance where the doctrine
of Gusik in so many words has been reaffirmed by this court
since then and it has apparently, however, been held inapplicabla in military habeas corpus cases which do not attack
court martial proceedings per se but rather question military
jurisdiction.
Q

I am sorry, but I don't quite get your answer

to the Solicitor General8s principal argument on mootness as
I understand it which is if the sentence has expired, terminated
and the show is over, isn't that right?
A

That is what the Solicitor General argued.

Q

What is your reply to that?

A

That first the sentence, the reply is two-fold.

.

First that any Justice of this Court, just as the entire court

from confinement.
Q

to
ti
12

13

But under the rule of criminal justice.as 1

understand it the computation of the amount of time that a
man has served does not depend on whether he is or is not in

|
confinement.

That is the rule Mr. Justice Stewart was talking

about.

14

A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

57 <b) .

!

15
A

16

17
18

19

j

57(b), your Honor, Article 57(b) does, however,

provide that time shall not be credited where the sentence is
suspended.

Now the manual for courts martial which has the

effect ——
G

What suspended the sentence?

That is not the

20
same thing as releasing a man from confinement is it?
21
Q

It says the sentence to confinement is

A

Paragraph 97(c) of the Manual for Courts Martial

22
suspended.
23

24
which appears in our brief sets forth a series of circumstances
23
14

where a sentence is considered suspended.

And, it is evident

from the text of the language itself that these were not
intended to be an exclusive cataloging-

97(c), Mr. Justice,

is on pages 6 and 7 of Petitioner's brief.
How one of the specifications in this concededly
non-exhausfcive listing is periods during which the person
undergoing such a sentence is erroneously released from con­
finement upon his petition for writ of habeas corpus under
a court order which is later reversed by a competent tribunal,
shall be excluded in computing the services of the time of the
punishment.
If 1 may proceed with the argument on exhaustion,
there is great significance here in the decision of the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia affirmed by this Court
in the case of United States ex rel. Guagliardo against
McElroy.
It was specifically held there that the rule of
exhaustion does not apply where military jurisdiction is
challenged.

Petitioner in this case is not making a habeas

corpus attack on the many errors which he believes occurred
in the court martial.
He is content to exhaust all of his military remedies j
for that purpose.

Habeas corpus here is sought so that if

the errors are redressed on appeal he will not have been
deprived of that redress by intervening confinement.
15

1

When the convening authority» the Respondent General

*>

Bond attempted to confine Captain Noyd in violation of Article

3

71(c),» we contend that he acted beyond his jurisdiction.

4

certainly had jurisdiction, to convene a court martial to try

5

Captain Noyd.

6

determination was made that restraint was necessary to insure

7

SO

SI
12

14
13

IS

He

He had jurisdiction to confine him if a

his presence.
He had jurisdiction to confine him after completion
of appellate review but he was totally devoid of jurisdiction
to confine prior to the completion of appellate review.
If I may respectfully suggest» the entire doctrine
of exhaustion of remedies is subject to continuing re-examination
these days» because of its sometimes wooden application»
causes, renders the right remediless.
As this Court observed in the case of NLRB against
Marine Workers, as a result of the original application of
the doctrine sometimes the litigant becomes exhausted instead

17
18

19
20

of the remedies.
Our brief cites a large number of cases where courts
have not required exhaustion where one the imposer of sanctions
acted beyond his jurisdiction, two, the administrative remedy

21

or the remedy which it is said one should exhaust is inadequate,
22
or whether the delay of the exhaustion process would cause
23
irreparable injury, or whether the attempted exhaustion would
24
be a futility.
25
16

1

Indeed, if I may respectfully suggest further that

2

perhaps the entire doctrine of exhaustion of remadias arose

3

in an administrative law context in an era of 20, 30, 40 years

4

ago when there was an atmosphere of administrative omnipotence,

5

6
?
8
9
10

a feeling I believe communicated to me in part when I went to
law school and all of the nation’s problems could be solved
by administrative agencies and the administrative process and
let us keep the courts out.
But now on a sober second look, the Courts are in­
creasingly recognizing in this court that the judicially
developed doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies

u
12
1.3
14

very often causes injustice and must be disregarded where it
would cause injustice»
With specific reference to the suggested remedies in
the opinion of the court below, it was first suggested that

15
perhaps the normal appellate process should be used.

But the

16
normal appellate process in this case would obviously have been
1?
ineffective because of a lapse of many months between con­
13

i 19

viction and appellate decisions»
We cite in our brief a number of cases where that

20
was in fact the case»

I cited that just on review generally

21
of one volume of the court raartial reports, many cases were

22
found '4iere the Court of Military Appeals reverses a conviction
£3
only to find that the entire time of confinement has already
24
been served»
25

17

1

Well* it was suggested that an extraordinary writ

Z

application should be made to the Court of Military Appeals.

3

We suggest that this is inappropriate for a number of reasons,,

4

First of all the Court of Military Appeals which only recognised

S

that it had such jurisdiction within the last year or so would

6

have an extraordinary strain placed on its facilities.
It is a three judge appellate tribunal sitting in

7

8

Washington,

It can handle only a handful of the cases that

9

are presented to it for review.
If it was the court of original and exclusive

10
11

jurisdiction of military habeas corpus applications for more

12

than 100 Federal Districts in the Territory of the United

13

States and in the States of Alaska and Hawaii and the

14

territories and possessions as well, it would be just im­

15

possible for the Court of Military Appeals to handle such a

16

load,

17

Furthermore, the nature of habeas corpus as this

18

Court instructed in Johnson against Eisentrager requires the

IS

personal presence of the individual at the habeas hearing.

20

It would obviously be impracticable to place upon the military

21

this requirement of producing a military prisoner in Washington

22

whenever an application or a petition for a writ is filed.

23
24
25

We are not attacking the military

as the champions of it.
Our position supports the integrity of the military — ' - ■-

For if a commanding officer can affect a

23
de facto execution of a one-year prison sentence prior to the
24
completion of the military' appellate process in direct

development of greater rights for the serviceman is the

development of further and more refined appellate jurisdiction,

8

that part of the history of increasing due process has been
the providing of a gap of a space between the Court of

The consistent interpretation of Article 71(c) which

we have catalogued in a long list of cases in our brief does
not show a single instance where the Government’s argument that

Government cites no cases.
At the very least, Judge Payne in the District of

The distinction is attempted to be made by the

that an adjudged prisoner is not compelled to work, but the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAKES van R. SPRINGER, ESQ»

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SPRINGER:

7

a

11
12
13
14
15

16
17

Captain Noyd's Air Force career has, in fact, given
rise to a number of difficult

20

questions about the Government

in regulation of the Armed Forces.
;
Mr. Karpatkin enumerated some of the history of the
litigation in which he has been involved.

His principal claim

concerning the alleged impropriety and the denial of conscien­
tious objector status to him is now before the Court of
:
Military Appeals. It may well return to the civil courts and

j

it may well return here.
But those questions are not involved in the case that

18
19

<

the Court.

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

!

is here nov?.

In contrast, this case involves a bottom of

what is a rather narrow and highly technical question of
military penology, the nature of the restraints that the

2!
22

Uniform Code of Military Justice permits the military to put
upon & serviceman after 'a court martial conviction and while

23
24

he is in the process of exhausting his military rights to
appeal.

25

i1

Fortuitously, this case comes here with Captain Moyd
; as the defendant, but it might as well have been a more
conventional serviceman charged with a routine military
■

offense»
And, of course, it is important to recognise that
the legal principles for which the petitioner is arguing here
are principles that would apply across the board in military
cases to any military defendant, whether he were charged with
desertion or murder or any other crime that could appropriately
be tried by a court martial.
Q

Are there any differences made by the Uniform

Code of Military Justice in this area between officers and
enlisted men?
A

1 believe not in the Code.

In the regulations

there are certain more or less technical distinctions in the
treatment that may be given to an officer as distinguished
from an enlisted man at any particular point.
This, of course, arises out of the time-honored
distinctions that have existed in the services in those
regards.
In our brief
Q

These provisions we are dealing with here

primarily are applicable throughout the Air Force?
A

Generally applicable throughout the Air Force

and, of coiirse, throughout all the services becaiase it is a
24

1

2

uniform coda.
In our brief and in our submissions in response to

3

the petition for certiorari we have raised the suggestion

4

that this case may have become moot because of certain tech­

5

nical rules in the Code relating to the service of confinement, \

€

7
3
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

16

to the service of military sentences to confinement.
1 would suggest unless the court desires otherwise
that we simply refer the court to what we have said in our
brief, I think there is little more that can be said.
In any event there seems to be agreement on the
fact that at most Captain Noyd has two days remaining to serve
on his sentence to confinement.
Q

Before you leave that question, Counsel, does

it not turn on the last part of Article

5.7(b), that the

period during which the sentence to confinement is suspended
shall be excluded in computing the service?
A

I think certainly if this sentence xvere in fact

1?
18
13
20
21
22

suspended, Mr. Justice, by your order.
Q

Yes, the sentence to confinement.

A

Yes, if that had been the effect, I think it

j

would certainly follow that the case is not moot and there ars
I
two days remaining.
I might just point out in that regard a recent

23
amendment to Article 57(b) that is not applicable here but
24
wall become applicable on August 1 of this year and perhaps
25

25
1

1

does cast some light on what the meaning of suspension is.

z
3

That amendment for the first time introduces some­
thing

approximating bail in the military and it says that a

4

commanding officer may defer serving of a sentence to con­

5

finement.

6

which you have referred, Mr. Justice, is now amended to read

7

effective August 1, 1969, "That periods during which the

8

sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be

9

excluded in computing the services of the client."
So I would suggest for what it is worth that that is

10

11
12

some, perhaps after the fact, an indication by Congress as to
what suspension may have meant.

13
1.4

17

What do you deduce from that with respect to

A

That the release from confinement is not tanta­

mount to a suspension within the meaning of Article 57(b)

as

it reads effective August 1, 1963, or effective in Noyd's case.
Q

A

No, and, of course, we are not suggesting that

A

Yes , is that in the case of a civilian trial

10

Q

Why, why in this case?

ii

A

Well, there are a number of elements that could

12

13

j

go into the Commanding Officer’s exercise of his discretion»
One, that has been suggested and is conceded by
\

14

Mr. Karpatkin is the desire to avoid flight.

There are —- well

15

the Bail Reform Act of 1966 states as to civilian criminals

16

that in addition to that reason the danger to the community

A

Is there much danger of fleeing a military
Why couldn’t he foe confined to the camp?
That certainly would foe a factor to go into the

21

military Commanding Officer’s discretion.

22

is that there is a discretion.

23
24
25

Q

My only point here

My final question is, this case that is now in

the Court of Military Appeals, if the petitioner wins, he just
lost a year on general principle.

27

Am I right?

A

1

Well, of course, he has at the most two days,

17

I thought your construction of the Military

Code was that the sentence ran whether he was confined or not,
is that right?
A

Yes, yes, that is correct.

Q

Unless there is some foriaal suspension of the

sentence?

My suggestion was that he has, of course, bean
under some restraint.

Q

4

In any event he

what is the reason for the provision of saying the sentence
runs whether you are confined or not?

Now let us assume a

21

case where he is not confined at all, on appeal.

The sentence

22
still runs.

Why?

23
A

There are a number of reasons perhaps.

There

24

are peculiar rules about the computation of sentences within
25

28

the service.
Q

There are no concurrent sentences.
Well, this is one peculiar rule I would think

that you are saying and the law seems to say that it just runs,
from the time it is imposed, period, whether he is confined
or not,,
A

Yes,

Q

Well, why is that?

A

This may be an element of equity that there are

no concurrent sentences — it may be also that it is in fact
I think. probably less easy to be released, for a serviceman
to be relieved of confinement while his appeal is pending under
the rules in the Manual of Courts Martial that apply here.
For that reason it may be appropriate to say,
certainly it is credit in fact.

1 must say this is Congressiona 1

judgment.
Q

What you really are suggesting then is that the

sentence runs when he is confined and it doesn’t run when he
isn't?
A

No, it runs one way or another.

Of course,

there are these technical problems as to what is confinement
and what is not.

We say that in fact the status in which

Captain Noyd was, though it was undoubtedly unpleasant --Q

Well, what difference does it make for purposes

of your mootness argument it doesn’t make any difference at
all.
29

A

1

Whether he was in fact confined* 'that is true.

2

1 think there is no question whatever that whatever the reason

3

may be* Article 57(b) does make a sentence run.

4

Q

Wo matter

S

A

Wo matter what the treatment was or -—-

S

Q

Well* you see 57(b)

as we pointed out earlier

7

refers to the suspension of a sentence to confinement and that

8

suspension of a sentence to confinement told the length of

9

the term.
A

10

11
12

the fact that a man is not in restraint does not* does clearly
not amount to a suspension.
Q

13
14
15

Yes* but we say certainly in the ordinary case

But the sentence to confinement to which he was

sentenced here* he was sentenced to confinement for a year*
wasn't he?

16

A

Yes* he was.

Q

Wow* that sentence to confinement couldn't be

17
executed

so-called* could it?

18

A

It could not be executed until after the

19
military —

20
Q

And that means he couldn't be confined?

A

He CGuldnst be confined at hard labor0

21
22

Yes* he couldn't be confined at hard labor

Q

We do not derive any

Well, my order, however, it may be viewed at

this time seems on the face to address itself to the problem
of confinement»
A

Yes, and, of course, that is the basis of our

mootness argument, that confinement and service are in this
peculiar code we are dealing with different things»
We have also urged that the Court of Appeals was
right in treating the merits of Captain Noyd’s claim as
improperly before the civil courts because of his failure to
exhaust the remedy in the military courts that was clearly
available to him at the time that he came to the civil courts»

This is an important point and it is one

to return to but I think perhaps it would be helpful if I
18

discussed the merits even though we have two reasons for
©
saying why the merits should not be reached»
20
I think it perhaps will put the case in better focus»
21

Mr» Karpatkinss argument, at least orally, rests
22
largely upon his interpretation of Article 7 (c) of the Code,
23
which is the provision that prohibits the execution of a sen­
24
tence until it has been completely reviewed by the military
25

[
If

1

courts and iri the case of an officer such as Captain Noyd by

2

the Service Secretary.
He says that, for this reason the order directing

3
4

that. Captain Noyd be sentenced to the special officer facilities

5

at Fort Leavenworth was an improper order.
I think the first thing that should be said about

6

7

that is that whatever else may be moot in this case, certainly

8

the order purporting to send Captain Noyd to Leavenworth is

9

now moot.

10

The regulations that govern such matters make it

11

clear that no man can be sent to a disciplinary barracks

12

unless he has six months remaining to serve on his sentence.

13
14

15

Now even if this case is not moot it appears to be agreed
that there are only two days left.
So for that reason, I think that the Leavenworth
Order, which has been suspended ever since -- shortly after

16
it was issued by the order of the DistrictCourt and the stay
17

18
1©

by the Tenth Circuit of Mandate, I would suggest that that
order is not as a practical matter in issue in this case.
Q

It wasn't restored after the District Court,

20
order was was vacated?
21
&

No, Mr. Justice, the District Court said,

22
"Don't send him to Leavenworth but do whatever else you want."

23
Th® Tenth Circuit reversed that and said that the case should

24
not have been entertained but has stayed its mandate pending

this court's action so that order has remained in effect.
Q

Didn31 the convening authority withdraw that

order then and amend it or something?
A

I believe not as a technical matter,, Mr, Justice,

Thera have been subsequent orders about the confinement that
has in fact taken place,
Q

But that was never actually withdrawn by the

original poligator (?) of it?
A

It is simply by operation of the court's order.

In any event we would suggest as we point out in our
brief the District Court's

disposition of the Leavenworth

order reflected either a misunderstanding again of what is a
highly technical provision in the military law as to what
execution is, or else perhaps, and this matter is not discussed
in much detail in the District Court opinion, a misunder­
standing of the nature of the confinement to which Captain
Noyd would have been subjected had he been at Leavenworth,
'
There are, in fact, separate facilities with very
separate treatment for officers awaiting appeal.

They are

; very separate and verv different from the facilities and

|

; treatment that are given to regular prisoners at Leavenworth,
It has been the standard practice to send so-called

I
I

adjudged officers awaiting appeal to Leavenworth rather than
retaining them at their bases because of the special problems

24

that the status of an officer creates with respect to
25

33

i

I

restraints on his base.

z

This has been up held in the case of Captain Levy

3

and we submit that it is an abuse of discretion or an execu­

4

tion of the sentence in this case but as I said,, I don't

5

think we have to reach the Leavenworth order.
So that reduces the case on the merits, if the

6
7

merits should have been reached, to the petitioner's claim

8

that the restraint to which he was subjected at Cannon Air

9

Force Base where he has bean stationed at the pertinent times

10

exceeded what the Uniform Code of Military Justice permits.
I believe it is accurate to say that the petitioner

11

ia
13

concedes that some restraint of a convicted person and a
convicted officer while there is appeal pending is permissible.
So the real question here is whether the restraint

14
15
10

that it was imposed upon Captain Noyd by his arrest in
quarters was a proper restraint.
I

The answer at least to the legal principles that

;

.

govern the question of the restraint that is allowed require

the locating and interpreting of a number of different pro­
visions of the Uniform Coda of Military Justice and the Manual,
j
Courts Martial which is, of.course, an executive order tech­
nically of the President and, of course, has the force of law.
It is the manual — it is promulgated by the President
under a provision of the Uniform Code, Article 36, which is
somewhat like the rules enabling act that has permitted this

25

34

1

court to promulgate the rules of civil and criminal procedure»

2

It is a direction to the President to provide for the procedure

3

in cases before courts martial,

4

How there is nothing in the Code its&lf, the statutory

5

Code* we submit that speaks expressly to the question of

S

restraint of a convicted prisoner or convicted individual while

7

his appeal is pending»

to

II
52
13
14

15
16
17

10
19
20
21

But there are certain provision in the Manual which
do speak directly to ithis»

First is Article, is Paragraph

21(d) of the Manual which provides that'Upon notification of
the result of the Court Martial trial the Commanding Officer
of the defendant in that trial will take prompt and appropriate
action with respect to the restraint of the person tried»
Such action," and continuing to quote, "depending upon the
circumstances may involve the immediate release of the person
from any restraint or the imposition of any necessary re­
straint pending final action on the case»55
In its most recent statement on this question of
custody pending the appeal, the Levy case some two years ago,
the Court of Military Appeals held that although there is no
such thing as bail in the sense that we understand it, in
the military system, this section of the manual does give the

22
commanding officer of the defendant a discretion to determine
23

what custody, if any custody, is appropriate following a
24

conviction.
25
35

And the Court of Military Appeals in that Levy case,

1

2

although it denied Captain Lew release, made it very clear

3

that it would review the exercise of that discretion

4

commanding officer involved in each case it was brought to it

5

on habeas corpus and would reverse the commanderas action if

6

the discretion was abused»

toy the

is, as has been indicated, approval by the convening authority, j
in this case the Commander of the Twelfth Air Force, General
Bond.

And there are provisions —- there is a provision re'a

lating to restraint following this stage and that provision
is paragraph 89(c) of the Manual for Courts Martial.
That directs the convening authority to "Provide in
his action for the temporary custody of the accused pending

I
final disposition of the case upon further appellate review."
<
And that further review is reviewed by the Board of Review which
has taken place in this case and by the Court of Military
Appeals, the civilian court, a court with civilian members
which action is still pending in Captain Noyd’s case.
|

.

One other provision of the manual relates to custody
pending appeal and that is paragraph 18(b)(3)

of the Manual

which provides that no punishment other than restraint imposed
in accordance with regulations may be imposed upon an accused

23
while his appeal is pending.

We think it is clear, as the Court of Military

8K

Appeals has held that these provisions of the Manual issued

by the President pursuant to statutory authority, provide a

3

basis for appropriate restraint pending a military appeal,
Now, petitioner contends that a provision of the Code

4

.

S

does in fact relate to this Article 13 which says that the

6

arrest or confinement of a person "being held for trial or

■

the result of trial" may not be any more rigorous than the
circumstances required to insure his presence.

This, we think, is wrong, if nothing else in light

of the caption of that article of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice which says punishment prohibited before trial and in
fact there are other places in the manual where it is made
clear that the result of the trial means what in common sense
terms you would think it would mean, the result of the trial
proceeding itself, and not the further steps of appeal,

No, but he is entitled to a reasonable exercise

And what is their position? Different than that.

On this point, Mr» Justice, I confess I don't

The standard is the Article 13 standard which is whether there

down to.

not appropriate for a civilian court, at least under the

facts of this case, a case of this

That discretion is reviewable by

a kind of civilian review,, the rights of servicemen.

That

court has a supervisory power over the operation of military
justice and it is a power that has articulated itself and
recognised and I think that that supervisory power gives it
perhaps a good deal more discretion than I would say a civilian
court has --- a good deal more latitude than a civilian court
has in reviewing the discretion of the military officers.
I think this court recognises that its supervisory
power over the Federal criminal justice gives it a good deal
more power than for example, its more strictly legal authority
over state criminal justice.
Q

Approximately how long does it take to process

the case in the Military Court of Appeals?
A

Well, in this case, for the remedy that we are

suggesting here, habeas corpus, it takes no longer than a habeas
corpus in a civilian court.
■

Q

How long does the regular one take?

Over a year isn't it?
A

I would say yes, sir.

Q

So that anybody with a one-year sentence, he

j
might just as well forget about it?
A

Well, except, Mr. Justice, and this is the

military remedy to which we really point, there is this remedy
of habeas corpus in the Court of Military Appeals which can
be had as promptly as civilian habeas corpus„

I think he can get more relief from the Court of Military

suggest in accordance with familiar principles of exhaustion

or remedies in other areas and in light of what is obviously
24
a highly technical question here there is good reason why

:
41

the expert court that is charged with working out these matters
in military justice should pass upon them before a civilian
court is asked to come in with relatively little guidance
other than normally the guidance that civilian counsel can
give him.

How long has he been confined now?

A

It was of the order of nine months that he was

in this restrained state of arrest in quarters.

Of course,

If

when he went to the civilian court he could have been out, as
he could have been in the case of a civilian habeas corpus

Q

What is the Government's position with respect

to the power of a District Judge or a Federal District Judge
to direct that the prisoner held on the court martial be
released pending further proceedings?
A

Well, I think that would depend upon the nature

of the question that he raises.

Mr. Karpatkin has referred to

the Raid and Covert line of cases where the claim is that the
military has no jurisdiction to try this matter.
I think it is the same as the 05 Callahan case that
is now pending.

I understand that.

If. it is not a question of jurisdictional

ask to be released pending completion of the administrative
process.

Certainly, Mr» Justice, the civilian court

would have jurisdiction to entertain that claim as to whether

When there has been

You and I understand that we are talking about

diction, and in that case you nevertheless take the position

Q

that there is power, power in the District Court.

9

A

Yes.

10

Q

Even though I understand what you say about

11

the propriety of its exercise.

I find it difficult to concede but in this

13

case with the nature of claims to be handled that there would

14

be room left for civilian court to do anything after

10

But if you assume, if you start off with an

i

17

order shipping him to Leavenworth and then you read Article 13, ;
I

10

which says that the confinement during or after the trial,

19

presumably pending exhaustion shall be no more rigorous than

20

circumstances required to insure his presence, you get into

i

21

deep water, don't you?
Because sending him to Leavenworth is certainly more

22
23

rigorous than what is needed, to require his presence.
A

24
25

In the first place, Mr. Justice, we do say that

Article 13 does not apply to the post conviction period pending
appeal.

44

Q

It says while being held for trail or the

result of trial»
A

Yes, but it for one thing looking at the heading

of that section where it says no punishment before trial we
suggest that provision of theCode does not govern the period
when appellate review was pending»
In any event, the question is of course a question
of whether ornot discretion was abused»
Q

I didn't think whether the discretion was abused,

I

whether the standard to insure his presence was abused if
13 applies»

A

Yes, but it is a matter of discretion with

the appropriate commander to determine, a matter of reviewable
discretion to determine what is necessary to keep this prisoner j
from fleeing»
.

Now, for example, in the case of Captain Levy, I
believe the District Court in Kansas held, has reviewed it

j

and determined that that was a permissible exercise of
i

s

I discretion» This, of course, was in light of the fact that
!
the man was an officer, that there are practical matters

!

Q

You suggest that 13 be read as if it did not

i

include the words "or the result thereof”?
:

A

I am suggesting that the words "as a result

I

of trial" not be read to encompass the extended period when
I

appellate processes are in course»

I suggest it is a strained

reading to say that when this court grants certiorari --

2
3

Q

It is a strained reading for me to eliminate

from Article 13 "as a result of trial"»
A

Yes, and the one other point I would like to

make in this regard again is that it is a strange result if

S

the military, in fact, is more restricted in the restraints

it can impose pending appeal than are the civilian authorities,

9

Well, to insure his presence has a flavor of

10

our bond provision to release on bond and recognizance and all

11

that to insure his presence.
A

12

Yes, Mr. Justice, but my point here is that

13

where in the civilian system whereas I believe it is correct to

14

say that before trial the only reason for keeping a man in

15

custody is to assure his presence.
Following a conviction and pending an appeal there

are other applicable standards in the statute.

perhaps startling result is one reason why 13 should not be
so read.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN M. KARPATKIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KARPATKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I should first observe that I believe I was reliably
informed by a responsible officer in the Judge Advocate
General's department of the Air Force that the Air Force still
regards the Leavenworth order as

in effect and that they are

not —■■ that they do not believe that they are limited by the
six-month proviso for the service of time at Leavenworth
because it applies from the date of the issuance of the order.
I don't believe that they would practically try to
ship Captain Noyd there for two days.

But they do regard

the order as being in legal effect.
I am surprised at the Solicitor General's recent
statement because it seems to be in direct conflict with the
words in his brief.
Referring to two decisions of the Court of Military
Appeals, the cases of Teague and Petroff-Tachomakoff, on page 52
i

of the Government's brief, while those cases do find express
statutory support in Article 13 for imposing conviction
restraint they do not hold that the permissible grounds for
pretrial restraint are also the only justification for post­
trial restraint.
I believe he is coming to this court now and making
a completely different argument.

Nov; he says it provides no

47
i

1

basis whatsoever for post-conviction restraint.

2

I think that what we have here is an assertion by

3

the Government of raw, naked power to eimprison a convicted

4

prisoner prior to the completion of his appellate process

5

without stating any justification whatsoever.

6

There was no return to the petition for the writ here.

7

There was no statement by the Government of any desire to

8

present evidence.

9

conditions of Captain Noyd's confinement at any time either

to

at Leavenworth or anywhere else were necessary to insure his

ii

presence at trial.

12

No attempt was made to show that the

The civilian cases which are cited in the Solicitor

13

General's brief involve, in addition to insuring presence

14

at trial, where an appeal is frivolous or dilitary or like

15

in the Carbo case where the substantial probability of danger

16

to witnesses.

17

Now surely nothing like that is even remotely

18

involved in this case.

13

that no such showing could be made and indeed no such showing

2.0

could be made.

21
22
23
24
25

The

Government in effect concedes

The prosecutor at the trial and everybody involved
in Captain Noyd’s tortuous, legal proceedings have conceded
from beginning to the end his excellent character and sincerity
and that there is no danger of his doing anything of the
nature of flight.
48

In essence, I respectfully suggest that the Govern­
ment is arguing that there was a right to preventative
I detention under these circumstances.

Even without any showing

that the detention was necessary.
The Government is arguing that there is a right to
punish without an offense being committed, without any charge,
without any trial and without any conviction.
I respectfully suggest that this process, which has
apparently been going on in the military for many years where
just automatically somebody is just sent off to jail as soon
as he is convicted regardless of his appeals.

That finally a

casei involving this issue has reached this honorable court and
that this, I respectfully suggest, is the appropriate time
for this court to advise themilitary and to advise the popu­
lation that not only can the military not violate the
Constitution but they certainly cannot violate their own
Uniform Code of Military Justice which apparently they have
been flagrantly doing for the last 15 years.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Wa will rise now.
(Whereupon, at 2:10 p.ra. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded, the Court recessing, to
reconvene at 10 arm. Monday, April 28, 1969.)
