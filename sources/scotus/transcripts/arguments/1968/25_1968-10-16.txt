ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARMAND DERFNER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

0

s

MR. DERFNER;

May it please the court, the question

in these three consolidated cases from the Southern District

10

of Mississippi is how much room Congress intended to leave

n

when it passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to allow the

12

13
14
15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Southern States covered by the Voting Rights Act to continue
evading the guarantees of the 15th Amendment.
The answer, we believe, is found in the provision of
that Act which involves this case, Section 5, in which Congress
after having Section 4 outlaw any tests or devices, went
further and said that no State covered by the Act might enact
or seek to administer any voting qualifications or change its
voting standards, practice, or procedure with respect to
voting different from that in effect in 1964, or November of
1964, without seeking prior approval from either the Attorney
General of the United States or getting a declaratory judgment
from the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia, establishing that that new statute and regulation
did not have discriminatory purpose or effect.
4-

-

1

The three cases here ali involve statutes which the

Z

State of Mississippi passed in 1966, at its First Legislative

3

Session after the passing of the Voting Rights Act which we

4

claim have the purpose and effect of discriminating in voting

3

by reason of race, and which voting laws are in Section 5; and

6

as to which there is no dispute, these statutes were not sub­

1

mitted to the Attorney General or for a declaratory judgment.
In Mo. 25, the Legislature allowed the county to

0
9

shift its manner of appointing the Board of Supervisors from

10

district elections to at large elections, thus allowing a

11

county that might have one or more Negro majorities to elect,

12

all white supervisors.
In Mo. 26, the Bunfcon Case, the Legislature changed

13
14

the Office of County Superintendent of Education which had

15

previously been elective, to appointive, and appointive, and

16

did so with respect to 11 counties of which 9 had Negro

17

majorities.
In No. 36, Whitley versus Williams, the Legislature

18
19

adopted an amendment to Section 3260 which provides the manner

20

by which independent candidates may get on the ballot, and in

21

effect set up an obstacle course which was designed and had the!

22

effect of forcing independent candidates at, great trouble

23

an effort to go into the Democratic Primary or a party

24

primary, and to avoid seeking to run as independents.

25

Q

Mr. Derfner, would you mind speaking up a little

-

5

-

1

2

bit or getting a little closer to the microphone.
A

I am sorry.
No. 36, Whitley versus Williams arose in 1966.

3

The

4

statute involved an amendment to Section 3260 which was passed

S

in June of 1966 after Reverend Whitley and one other person

6

had run in the Democratic Primary, having run for the Office

7

of United States Senator, and having lost in the Primary and

8

then indicating he was interested in running in the General

9

Election.
At that point the amendment was passed which had this

10

11

effect:

It multiplied the number of signatures that a person

12

must gain to gain a place on the ballot .

13

In the case of Reverend Whitley, the number of sig­

14

natures was multiplied or changed from 1,000 to 10,000, since

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

it was a state-wide office.
Q

How many registered voters are there in that State?

A

In Mississippi, at that, time there were probably in

the neighborhood of 400,000 or 500,000 registered voters.
The second thing it did was to require that these
signatures be submitted at a much earlier date than formerly.
The former practice or former statute had provided that the
required number of signatures be submitted 40 days before the
General Election.
In practical effect it was the end of September.
The new regulation or the new statute required the signatures
6

-

-

1

be submitted all at the same time as one would qualify for

2

running in the Party Primary.
Now, the statutes governing running in the Party

3
4

Primaries require that 60 days before the primary a candidate

5

must submit his notice of intention to run and a filing fee of

6

a small amount to the Executive Secretary of his Party, which

7

means that under the new statute whereas someone wanting to

8

run in a Party Primary had to submit by some date in April, say

9

$100 or $200 plus a notice of intention to run. Reverend

10

Whitley or whoever wished to run as an independent had to sub­

n

mit petitions with 10,000 or some lesser number of signatures

12

depending on what office was involved.
The third, and in some ways the most significant,

13
14

effect was to impose a new requirement that one who had voted

15

in a Party Primary could not thereafter run as an independent.

16

Q

Anyone who has ever voted in a primary?

17

A

No, I think the statute means one who has voted in

18

the primary that year, the primary for the same office for

ID

which he is running.

20

Q

Is that an uncommon provision throughout the States?

21

A

I am not familiar with that, Mr. Chief Justice, but

22

I do know that that was not the provision of Mississippi

23

before and there had been a number of instances of people

24

being unsuccessful in primaries, and running in General

25

Elections.
-

7

-

There is a ease called Bowen versus Williams, cited

i
2

in the brief, where precisely that happened and the Supreme

3

Court of Mississippi held there was no impediment to that

4

being dona.

S

Q

I suppose that was under existing law?

G

A

There is a Section 3129 of the Mississippi Code which,

7

imposes a pledge of loyalty on anyone voting in a Party

8

Primary, but that has been held not to be enforceable in

9

connection with his running as an independent candidate.

10
11
12

i
Q

Mr. Derfner, what is the prohibition against, running

as an independent if you voted in the Primary?
A

There is no prohibition against running as an inde­

13

pendent if you had merely run but not voted in the Primary.

14

Nonetheless, the record shows at least one of the people who

15

*
was kept off the ballot in 1967 was kept off because he had

16

run in the primary, although he had not voted.
That does not appear to be what the statute says.

17
18

Q

Do you attack both the merits of the situation as

19

well as the fact that they should have gone to the Attorney

20

General or do you just say that they should have gone to the

21

Attorney General?

22

A

Oh, no, we believe, and in fact I don’t think we

23

would be here if we did not believe that this was a statute

24

that violates the 15th Amendment of the United States

25

Constitution.

t

Q

Is that before us?

z

A

No, your Honor.
All that is before you is whether this is a law that

3
4

imposes voting qualifications or standard practice and pro­

5

cedure with respect to voting.
If you decide that it is* then the statute could not

6

7

have been and cannot be put into effect until the Federal

0

clearance.

9

Q

That is the

sole issue in the case?

SO

A

That is the

sole issue.

11

Q

You did originally rely on the 15th Amendment also?

12

A

The 15th Amendment was in our pleading.

13

Q

Why did you

take it out?

14

A

We took oit

out* Justice Marshall* because in1967

15

when this case came up for the second time, the

16

in September and we did not believe we had enough time at

17

that time to put on a case with respect to the 15th Amendment,

18

and so at that time although the 14th and 15th Amendment

IS

claims remain in the case, we entered a stipulation with the

20

Appellees that the only issue before the District Court at

21
22
23
24
25

case came up

that time was the issue of Section 5.
This means by the way, as we maintain, that the
constitutional issues are still in the case, and that Section
23 did and does apply, and that wholly apart from any question
of Section 5 we were and are entitled to a three judge court
-

9

-

1

and this court would have jurisdiction by direct appeal.

2

did not mean in any way to take those issues out of the case,

3

and we believed that we could prove that if we were put to it.

4
5

6

Q

But you actually did it.

A

The stipulation which is in the record, in an

We

What did the stipulation

say?

7

appendix to the opinion of the three judge court, appearing on

0

page 39 of the record here, paragraph 5, that the only issue

i
;
9

before the court at this time is whether or not House Bill 6S

10

is an attempt by the State of Mississippi to enact or seek

11

to enact or administer any voting law of Section 5.

12

There is nothing in the stipulation, and nothing else

13

anywhere in the case that indicates that the constitutional

14

issues are no longer in the case.

15

The final requirement of the new Section 3260 was fchai

16

every signature on the petition had to be in the petitioner’s

17

own hand, his own handwriting.

18

this specific provision has not been at issue or been a

10

specific issue involved in any of the cases of record, and it

20

is not clear just how far this goes, we think it is open to

21

the interpretation that this would prohibit illiterates from

O'*

signing petitions for independent candidates.

While it is not clear, while

23

After the statute was passed, Reverend Whitley and

24

two others who were kept off the ballot, submitted petitions

25

to run as independent candidates in the fall of 1966.
10

-

-

They

'1

were ruled off the ballot not because they had not complied

2

in time or because they had voted in the Primary, as to both

3

of which this would have been ex post facto law, but because

4

they had not submitted sufficient signatures.
At that point in the fa-1 of 1966, we filed this suit

S
6

as a class action on behalf of Reverend Whitley and the two

7

others in their capacity as voters and as candidates and &

8

three judge coxirt without going into any of the statutory or

9

constitutional issues, as an exercise of its equity juris­

10

diction and discretion, ruled that these three candidates

n

should be placed on the ballot.
In 1967, the situation arose again.

12

At that point,
I

13

as the record shows, there were at least 16 candidates ranging

14

from people who were running for Justice of the Peace all of

15

the way to Mrs, Hammer who sought to run for the State Senate

16

who had been ruled off the ballot.
I should mention that in the 1967 elections, which

17
18
19

were State-wide elections, they were virtually all State office?;
being chosen.
This was the first time in modern history that any

20

21,
22
23
24
25

substantial number of Negro candidates had run or sought to
run.

It was the first time in modern history that with the

exception of a single Negro community in Mississippi that any
candidates had been elected.
These 16 people were kept off the ballot for various
-IL

1

reasons although they had complied or would have complied with

2

the old provisions of Section 3260.

3

At that time we brought the suit on again, and this

4

time the three judge court ruled against us, and it was that

5

decision that held that Section 3260 dealt only with elections

6

or candidates but not with voting.

7

The point of this appeal, we submit, is much like

8

the point in Williams versus Rhodes decided by this court

9

yesterday, dealing with the right of the American Independent

10

11

Party to be on the ballot.
It spoke of the Ohio provision as a verging on the

12

right of qualified votens regardless of their political

13

persuasion to cast their votes effectively,

14

I think it is significant that Section 3260 is the

15

first or one of the first major attempts by the State of

16

Mississippi to deal in any significant way with the problem

17

of General Elections,

18

Mississippi as perhaps one of the most confirmed

19

one-party States of this nation, has always paid a great deal

20

more attention to regulation of primary elections than regu­

21

lation of general elections.

22

The two outstanding examples of that are the Corrupt

23

Practices Act which in Mississippi applies only to primary

24

elections and not the general elections, and the requirement

25

of the run-off which again applies only to primary elections
-

12

-

1

and not the general elections.

2

The position of Mississippi has always been that

3

whoever wins efche primary is essentially the winner of the

4

general election, and in most cases or many cases in recent

5

history there has not been any opposition in general elections.

6

At the same time with the passage of the

7

Rights Act of 1965, a new factor came into politics and this

8

was the Negro voter.
Prior to 1965, according to figures by the Civil

9
10

11

Voting

Rights Commission, only a small percentage of Negroes voted.
Q

Am I right in saying that the precise issue is the

m

scope of the provision of the statute which refers to quali­

13

fications or prerequisites to voting or standards and practices

14

and procedures?

15

A

That is right, your Honor.

16

Q

It is a question of the interpretation of the

17

coverage, or the sweep of that provision?

m

A

Yes, sir.

19

Q

And your argument so far it seems to me is on the

20

merits of the thing?

21

A

No.

22

Q

What do you contend that the statute covers?

23

A

We believe that Section 5 was intended to cover or

24

to be every bit as broad as the 15th Amendment itself, that

25

when Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 they
-

13-

?

knew full well that they had been relatively unsuccessful in

2

guaranteeing the provisions of the 15th Amendment before that.
They tried in 1957, and in I960, and in 1964.

3

We

4

believe that what Congress sought to do in 1965 was to insure

5

that they would not have to pass a Noting Rights Act of 1966

6

because they knew that on each occasion when they had passed

7

a

legislation before that, the States that they were aiming at
/
had then come up with another new provision that had not been

9

covered, by the Act, and so we think that Section 5 was passed

io

very broadly in order to cover everything

ii

be covered under the 15th Amendment.

Would it encompass things in your view that would

A

IS

possible that could

Well, under Section 5, the final determinatidn of the

United States District Court for the District of Columbia
would cover only things that were --- no, let me put it this
way:

With the exception of the placing of the burden of proof,

I believe that Section 5 would prohibit after clearance only
things that were in violation of the 15th Amendment.
Q

A good faith literacy test itself would not in and

of itself violate the 15th Amendment?
A

A good faith one, yes.

Q

Obviously it "would come under Section 5.

A

Well, it would come under Section 5 in the sense it

would have to be cleared under the provisions of Section 5.

12

A

Yes, any situation in which the State does anything

which has the potential of depriving someone from the right to
vote on the basis of race.
Q

The constitutionality of reapportionment statutes

would have to go to the District of Columbia.
A

Not all reapportionment cases.

will be dealing in somewhat more detail with that question.

19

Q

What wouldn't?

20

A

Only reapportionment cases from

I think Mr. Lightman

the covered States

would have to go through.
Q

All reapportionment cases from the covered States

23

would have the constitutionality passed upon by the District

24

of Columbia Court?

25

A

That is true.

Every reapportionment case would have

to be passed on, not necessarily by the District of Columbia

Court.

been done by the Attorney General, and I think the Attorney

4

General's Office indicates there has been a good many sub­

5

missions and all of these have been approved.

In most cases it could ba done and I believe it has

So that we think it is quite proper that where you

7

have a reapportionment plan you have in a sense the most

3

convenient opportunity for a State to discriminate in voting

9

with respect to race in a way which seems innocent.

10

We believe that where that is in fact innocent that

11

there would be no trouble.

12

it is perfectly proper to have the State be: required to pass

Where it is not in fact innocent,

muster by submitting to the Attorney General and if he dis­
approves, to seek a declaratory judgment.

20

approve.

21

23

24
25 |

Q

We ©r© not concerned with whether he approves

it or not.
A

No, I think a statute like that should be submitted

and it is covered by Section 5.

You can think of examples.

Suppose, or take the grandfather clause before this

17

1
2,
3

Court.

Suppose the statute said not simply that one who

was eligible to vote in .1867 or was the ancestor of one
entitled to vote, and suppose the statute said one who was
eligible to vote in 1867 may run for office as an

4
independent, or may run for office if he was not so eligible

5
to vote or his ancestor was not he could not run for office.
6

We think that is the sort of thing that is
7
precisely covered by the statute.

I might say in this

8

connection that the appellees have talked about the language
9
of Section 5 as being somewhat narrow.

They talk about the

10

use of the word "comply”, in the second sentence of
11

Section 5, and said unless and until clearance is obtained
12

no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to
13

comply.
14
Ws think there that the words "comply" were not
15
intended to be and should not be read as limiting the
16
terms "voting standard practice, procedure and so on.”
17
The word “comply” taken in its logical sense
10

would apply to the qualification or prerequisite.

It

10

would not be an apt limiting phrase with respect to 'the
20

phrases of standard practice or procedure which were inserted
21

in the Act after its introduction.
22

For example, we can think of examples that I think
23

10
11

All of these, I believe, would clearly come within

I think that those are good examples showing why
the phrase should not be limited in the statute.

12

I think the coverage of Section 5 is the fact

that all of these statutes may have to be submitted for

approval, i.s not one that should be regarded as a reason

to narrow the scope of Section 5.

Certainly it is strong

medicine.
Congress knew when it passed Section 5 that it

8

was dealing with a virolent disease, and the Very fact

9

that great numbers of submissions have come to the Attorney

20

General, in almost every case from states under the law,

21

which indicates that Congress meant for the easy statutes,

22

the obvious statutes and the statutes that were constitutional

23

to sail through and they have sailed through, but Congress

24

meant to pvit a block on the states from monkeying around

Q

Do you know whether Mississippi submitted anything

to the Attorney General under this statute?

I think the Attorney General’s records indicate

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Lichtman,

you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. LICHTMAN
MR. LICHTMAN;

May it pleas© the Court, in November

13

of 1963, five white persons wer© elected members of the Board

14

of Supervisors, the principal governing officials, in

15

Adams and Forrest Counties, Mississippi, the counties

16

involved in Fairly v. Patterson, No. 25.

17

At that time, Megores were almost totally

ia

disenfranchised in Mississippi.

ID

Voting Rights Act was passed, and by June of 1966 it

20

was estimated that 132,000 Negroes were registered to vote

21

in Mississippi.

22
23
24
25

In August of 1965, the

About the sara© time, the Mississippi Legislature
amended Section 2870 of the Cod®, and presented those five
supervisors in Adams and Forrest Counties with a vehicle
or a d@vic© to continue themselves in office.
-

20-

That is the

!

Legislature gave those supervisors the option or the power

2

to adopt and order switching from a district by district

3

election system to an at-large system in the county.
Therefore, in Adams County, where census figures

4

5
6
7

8

show that Negroes have a majority in Sections 2 and 4, and
where census figures show whites have a county-wide
majority, the supervisors who were elected in November of
1963 were given a vehicle by which they could stay in power.
In Forrest County, the other county involved in

9
10
11
12
13
14

Fairly v. Patterson, where the district was closely divided
in 1960 and where Negroes now claim a slight voting
majority, and where whites have a heavy county-wide
voting majority, the supervisors who were elected in 1963
also chose in 1966 an at-large system.
A close look at this statute, Section 2870 as

15
16

amended in 1966, shows that a simple majority of the
supervisors, three out of five, may order an at-large

17
18

election where it serves their interests.
In other words, suppose a Negro were elcfced

19

supervisor in one of those two counties.

For the next

20

election, the remaining supervisors, those remaining super­
21
I

visors could adopt a. county-wide at-large system and insure the

22
defeat of that Negro supervisor elected prior to the at-large
23

system.
24

To be sure, the statute, if you look carefully at it,
25

i

contains a referendum provision but it is hardly a safeguard
here for we can expect the county-wide white majority in
that referendum to ratify the decision of th© supervisors to
go at-large»
Mississippi answers "Look how maiapportioned we
were, and our population districts were very uneven in
population terms, and we are only complying with the one-man,
one-vote mandate of the United States Constitution»"
First of all, as Justice Harlan indicated earlier,
the issue before this Court is not the precise*motivation
of the supervisors»

rfhat is the question for the Attorney

General upon submission or upon the District Court for
th© District of Columbia»

The question for this Court is,

given th© real possibility that this amendment to Section
2870 is a vehicle or a device to perpetuate the disenfranchisonuof Negroes, does Saction 5 in its broad sweep cover th© new
law?
Appellants in Number 25 submit that this is exactly
what Congress intended.

Congress intended once and for all to

make the Fifteenth Amendment affective, that to do so
Congress concluded that any new statute relating to the
effectiveness of th© right to vote, that any new statute
such as this must b© scrutinised by th© Attorney General
before it becomes operative.
in number 26, the second case about which 1 shall

speak, the Bunson case , we are dealing with a 1966 amendment

2

for which Mississippi has offered no explanation.

law was simply that all county Superintendents of Education,

4

surely the most important single educational official in

5

the county, the person charged with carrying out the mandate

6

of this Court and of the Constitution to integrate schools,

7

the old law was this official was elected unless 20 percent

8

of the voters petitioned for an election on the question of

9

whether or not to make it appointive.

10

The old

Suddenly, 10 months after the passage of the

n

Voting Rights Act in August of 1965, 11 of Mississippi’s

12

82 counties were in effect told, 81 Your county Board of

13

Education shall appoint your Superintendent of Education."
The record shows that nine of those 11 counties

14

15
16

have Negro majorities.
Q

Supposing the law had been across-the-board,

17

that Mississippi had said we are going to an appointive

18

system of school Superintendents throughout the state?

19

A

Our position, Justice Harlan

pardon me —

20

would be that that, too, should be submitted to the Attorney

21

General of the United States.

22

are excellent that if Mississippi had complied with Section 5

23

and had submitted that law, the Attorney General would not

24

have objected within 60 days and the law would have gone

Is there any population relationship to these 11

The counties, I believe, are spread throughout

the state, but Negroes only constitute 43 percent of the

population in all of Mississippi»

Can it be said

that this was done because of the size of the county, the

9

of the state or the smallest?

r

A

Do these 11 happen to be the largest counties

I think that they do not, Chief Justice Warren»

2

The only common element is that Negroes happen to be in the

3

majority in nin© of the 11 counties»

4

Q

Are they the majority in the other counties?

5

A

In a few others.

6

They have 43 percent of the

population in the total state.

Q

Well, is it very relevant?

Mr. Lichtman, when you answered Justice Harlan

that you thought a statute submitted to the Attorney General
would have been approved, would that answer apply in relation
to the question he put to you, to a state-wide statute
or are you saying this statute?
A

X was answering, X thought, his hypothetical

question which referred to a state-wide statute.
Q

Is that your view, is it the same?

A

In this caso I would allow the Assistant Attorney

General to answer the question.

My guess is that he will

want to scrutinise this very carefully.

X don’t know what

position h© will take on it.
Q

You ar© not making any submission that that is

involved?
A

Ho.

Q

On the other hand, 1 don't s®a why you need

21
to make any submission that this may bs violative of the
22
Fifteenth Amendment , or anything else.

It seems to me,

as you read Section 5, any change from the statute quo of

November 1, 1964, no matter how enlightened, n© matter how

well motivated and no matter how trivial is covered by

the language of the statute.

3

From then on it is up to the Attorney General.

4

If he is not satisfied with it, it is up to the United

5

States District Court for the District of Columbia.

do you have to submit to us that this may be discriminatory

or evilly motivated change.

Why

If you are right about

trivial change in the world, and yet it is under Section 5.
A

I think that that is correct, Justices Stewart.

Our point in going into the facts at all is that we know why

Congress passed this statute.

very broad.

15

of thing Congress had in mind.

statute could be very enlightened and nevertheless the State

17

of Mississippi, on© of those half a dozen states or so

The language of Section 5 is

You would be making the same argument if Mississippi

That is right.

Q

Suppose instead of th© District of Columbia» the

Act had said that it was first th© District Court?
A

Well» Justice Black» I would agree that th® point

12

here is that someone is scrutinising these statutes before

13

they go into effect.

14

15

Q

That would be ail right, wouldn't it, if the

Court was named?

16

A

I think so, Your Honor»

17

Q

Suppose another section provided that it be submitted

18

to a District Judge in Mississippi?

19

A

Congress in its wisdom could do that, I believe»

20

Q

I agree that they could do that»

21

A

Mr» Justice Whits asked Mr» Derfner earlier about

22
23

^apportionment„
A

And I would like to address myself to that for

24

a few moments.

Appellants in Fairly make no attempt to

25

distinguish our case or to distinguish Paction 5 from

I

reapportionment cases.

2

intended to cover any new statute which relates to the

3

effectiveness of the right to vote.

4

because of the constant attempts by the state, by the southern

5

states, to "outguess85 the federal courts, the Justice

6

Department and the Congress.
Q

7

Our position is that Section 5 was

Section 5 was drafted

Yon agree the statute isn't worded that broadly.

If that is what Congress had in mind, it would have been

8

very easy to say so.

9

A

10

We are reading essentially Section 14 which defines

voting, with Section 5.

11

Section 14 defines voting as all

action necessary to make a vote effective in an election. We

12

are reading that language into 5 to justify our broad reading.

13

Voting cases prior to the passage of the Voting

14

Rights Act of 1965 were very difficult to prove, they

15

were monumental t© try, and let us say it, the old laws

16

were not working, and Negroes were not getting erfranchised

17

in th© southern states.

18

A reapportionment case is precisely th© same

19

kind of case.

2,0

It is difficult to prove and it is

monumental to try.

21

Moreover, because the state can justify

its new law as an attempt to comply with the one-man, one-vote

22

mandat© of the Constitution, there is the constant danger

23

that this justification will be only a facade, that the
24

.

real purpose will be a discriminatory purpose, and there is

There will be no change.

The only change is that in those states that are covered
by the Act, before the plan goes into effect, it must be
submitted to the Attorney General.
Q

Are you suggesting that, for example, a District

12

Court in Mississippi, if he directed a reapportionment plan

13

it could not be affective until it was cleared by the

14

Attorney General?

15

16
17

A

That is our position.

I think Mr. Poliak, the

Assistant Attorney General, will relate to you —
Q

I am speaking not of a reapportionment plan enacted

18

by the State Legislature, but in the absence of one, an

19

apportionment plan directed by a United States District Court.

?

A

If I had to reach that question, my position would

be that before the state makes that new plan effective, it

would have to clear it with the Attorney General»

Yes, that is correct.

13

that none have been objected to so fax1.

A

I would phrase it this way, Mr, Justice White --

Q

Regardless of the jurisdiction of all of th©

other courts»
A

The local court in Mississippi will play the same

role it played before.

It will work out the plan if the

Legislature is unable to.

Before the new plan goes into

effect, it must be submitted to the Attorney General of the
United States.
Q

Or th© District Court.

Yes, and if the Attorney General objects, only

in that case does the question go before the District Court

It comes

Mow, you say nevertheless Mississippi

can't make it effective without going to the Attorney General
for his approval, and thereafter if he denies the getting
of a declaratory judgment from the District of Columbia,
and then coming back to us.

A

Except, Your Honor, I just can't conceive in

a situation like that, of the Attorney General objecting.
Everyone has scrutinised the plan for both Fifteenth
Amendment violations as well as Fourteenth Amendment
violations.
Q

We don't have any such case before us.

The Fairly

cases is not the usual kind of reapportionment case because
22

that was a case in which just a selected number of counties

24

were» involved, isn't that right?
A

I think that that is right, Mr. Justice Aortas.

What relief is asked?

6

A

Mr. Justice Black, our relief is based on several

7

oases, principles brought forth in several cases.

8

Q

What is it?

9

A

We ask that this Court order Mississippi to comply

10

with Section 5.

11

And submit it to the Attorney General?

12

A

That is correct.

S3

Q

But then what?

14

A

Well, the question arises, should they set aside»

15

We could also ask —

the old elections and should they have new elections.

15

Q

What election was it?

17

A

In November of 1967.

13
19

In the two counties affected

in Fairly, they held at-large elections.
Q

They would have to wait until the Attorney General

20

passed upon it and then it goes up to the Court of Appeals

21

and then to us.

22

A

By that time, it would probably be moot.

Mr., Justice Black, if the Attorney General does

not object within 60 days, I think that is the end of the

matter.

Q

10

How can that be done before the Court makes a

11

ruling?

The Act authorises th© Attorney General, to nullify

12

the state law.

13

A

The Court has two alternatives.

In that event, it is not final.

Mississippi has

f
two alternatives.

They can ceas© operating the new law,

or they can go to the District Court for th© District of
Columbia to seek to have th© new law approved.
Q

To get them to approve the law as constitutional.

A

That is correct, in effect, or as not having

a discriminatory purpose.
Q

It differs that the burden is on Mississippi

The result of that is that the Attorney General

17

of the United States, who is not a judge, and is not a court,

ib

can object to any state lav? regarding elections and he can

10

immediately require that state to have another election,

20

is that right?

22

A

That is right.

Mr. Justice Black, Congress as

The Constitution is an extra­

1

A

The issue was raised in South Carolina in the

2

Katzenbach case, and the majority of this court held that

3

Section 5 was constitutional, and Section 5 immediately

4

suspended the new law, and that until the covered state

5

clears the new law the law cannot go into effect.

6

Q

What you are saying now about the effect of the

Attorney General in his holding it bad,

requires the state to hold a new ©lection, which means

that the Attorney General is permitted to do this without

A

The appropriate remedy, Mr. Justice Black, in our
l

view, would, be to immediately undo what was done incorrectly
in November of 1967, and we should ask you to set these aside.
Q

But the situation is like I said it is.

Her© is

fe&? Attorney General, you are giving him the power, if

and it must have a n®w ©lection right away?
A

I would phrase it this way, Justice Black.---

Q

Well, is that what it would be?

A

That is the effect, but Congress aid the new law

was bad, and the Attorney General merely has th© power —
Q

The Congress didn't say the new law was bad.

That is right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. POLLAK

5

6

Mr. Poliak.

MR. POLLAKs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

7

the court,, the issue this morning is a statutory interpretation

8

and it involves the responsibilities of the states and the

9

rights of citizens under Section 5 of the Voting Rights

to
11
12

Act of 1965.
As has already been presented before the court,
the major and overriding issue is whether failure to comply

53

with the procedures of Section 5 precluded enforcement of

14

the changed laws concerning the election of county

15

16
17

18

supervisors * th© appointment of county school superintendents,
and the requirements for qualifications of independent
candidates.
Th© argument thus far has focused on on© of four

19

issues which the appellees have projected in the case, and

20

which w® believe are in the case.

21
22

23
24
25

I would like to state them and I am prepared to
present argument on each of them.
Th© first is whether Section 5 is limited to the
qualifications for registration to vote or whether it reaches
beyond that scope to cover changes which effect voting and
-

40*»

may violate the Fifteenth Amendment„

1

2

The second issue, not yefc discussed, is whether

3

where a state fails to coraply with the procedures of Section

4

5, a person whose vote is effective has a private right

5

of action to .seek to enjoin the enforcement of that changed

6

law.
The third issue is whether if such a private right

7
8

of action is authorised by Section 5 it must be brought as

9

the suits here were brought before a three-judge court.

10

In the last issue, it is whether these appeals are mooted

11

because when the Clerk of this court requested the Attorney

12

General for his views on March 11 of this year, he gave the

13

Attorney General notice of the changes and the Attorney

14

General has not made formal objection or at least that is how

15

the issue is stated in the appellees9 briefs.
I believe tha facts of these cases bear witness

'16

to the prophetic vision of the Congress in enacting the

17

IS

Voting Rights Act.

19

committees and the debates indicated, that once the barriers

20

to registration were down, the states covered by the Voting

21

Rights Act might resort as they had resorted through previous

22

It was concerned as the reports of the

100 years to other stratagems, to preclude effectis votes

'

2.3

24
25

by Negroes.
Tha Voting Rights Act was essentially a statute
which, one, suspended literacy tests and devices which had
-

41»
\

?

been used to discriminate, and two* as had the courts in

2

the previous years, sought to freeze the presently existing

3

statutes , so that when the literacy tests were out of the

4

way, and Negroes ware able to register, those then existing

5

statutes would remain in effect until the Attorney General

6

or a court of three judges and in turn, this court, had

7

reviewed the change to determine that the change was not a

8

violation of the Fifteenth Amendment,
It did not put any final powers in the Attorney

3
10
11

General as we read it,
Q

Did you say until someone had reviewed it to

12

determine whether it was a violation cf the Fifteenth

13

Amendment?

14

A

Who was that person?
The court of three judges of the United States

15

District Court for the District of Columbia.

16

in a court, and the only role of the Attorney General — there

17

is no requirement as we read the Section 5 that ths state

10

must make a submission to the Attorney General,

19

It was logged

It may move to the thr«e-judge court immediately

20

when it wishes to enact or enforce a changed law.

21

provision for the Attorney General is that if the state believer

22

.it has a change which is not violative of th© Fifteenth

23

Amendment and wishes to move through this procedure

24

established by Section 5 faster than it believes it can move

25

to th© District Court, it may submit it to the Attorney
42

'

The only

1
2

General„
Q

In either case* whether the case moves directly

3

to the District Court for the District of Columbia* or after

the refusal of the Attorney General to approve* must this

5

court get into that?

Q

So* we don’t involve th© Court of Appeals?

A

No* Mr. Justice.

Q

In the Katsenbaeh case* if that merely approved

the constitutionality of th© law and that is as far as it
went, do you say in that case that we hold that it governs
however it is applied?
A

I believe the decision of this court validated

the constitutionality of Section 5.
Q

To the extent of what?

Is that any way it is

applied?
A

Well* I believe the first issue that I articulated

this morning* the scope of Section 5* is still open for
this court feo rule in this case.
Q

That only ruled that it was constitutional so

23

far as requiring that the submission foa made.

Could it hold

24

at that time that however it was applied this was
25
-

43-

1

2

constitutional?
A

Your Honor, the court had Section 5 before it when

3

that South Carolina statute changing the hours of voting

4

from six o'clock in the evening to seven o'clock in the

5

evening was presented and the Attorney General adverted to

6

it in the course of the argument»
The court makes reference to that change in its

7

8

opinion, in the text and also in a footnote on page 320»

9

also makes the statement that there are indications in the

It

10

record that other sections of the country listed above have

II

also altered the voting laws since November 1, 1964»
But the court did not have before it the procedures

12

j

13

which would be followed by the Attorney General or beyond

14

■that by the court if there were any unusual procedures»

IS

Q

Do you think that it held in that case that it

16

would be constitutional, if it would be the result of

n

submitting it to the Attorney General, that that would nullify

18

state elections?

19

A

I believe the court made this holding --

20

Q

That wasn't the issue,

21

A

I want to stay away from a statement or an argument

22

that the court held if the Attorney General said it was

23

bad, I believe those were Your Honor's v/ords ——

24
25

Q

Or whatever was held,

A

The point that the court ruled upon was this, and
-

44"

„

1

I believe it did hold this

that the Act suspends new

a

voting regulations pending scrutiny by federal authorities

s

to determine whether their use would violate the Fifteenth

4

Amendment.
I believe that the Voting Rights Act, as I have

S

6

used the word before, froze the laws at the time it was

7

passed or as of November 1, 1964»

8

Q

Without any court passing upon it?

9

A

It froze those laws and said if the state wished

10

to change them -—-

11

Q

Was that the decree?

12

A

No, the Congress of the United States froze them»

Q

I have no doubt about what they intended.

We passed

on the constitutionality of it.
A

I believe that the court in South Carolina in

the Katzenbach casa, on pages 334 and 335 of 383 U.S. did
pass on the constitutionality of the suspension of changes
by the Congress.

]
2

Q

In that case,on those facts, to the extent that it

was filed that way?

3

A

I would respectfully --

Q

Do you think that the opinion would be that in any

5

way it was applied it would be constitutional?

6

think that, do you?

A

You don't

Your Honor, the application of the Act follows

8

after the freesAng.

9

of the Act is the procedure by which the state may put into

In other words, that the application

10

effect a change»

11

don't believe it reached this court because the Voting Rights

12

Act was passed in the intervening time — but the lower courts

13

of the United States in voting rights sections had adopted

14

the freesing principal.

The courts of the United States — and I

They had said that the laws under v;hich whites

15
16

were permitted to vote and Negroes were denied the vote —

17

those laws or those procedures would be frozen in effect

13

for a period of time which would allow the Negroes equal

19

rights to register.
That was the principal which Congress embodied

20
21

22

in Section 5.
Q

It was the principal to let the Attorney General

23

of the United States look at it, and he is not a judge, to

24

look at it and see if it violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

25

A

I don't believe that was the principal.
«-

46—

The

1

principal was that Congress said any change shall be

2

suspended, the present law as of November 1, 1964 shall

3

remain in effect»

4

Voting Rights Act is a five-year Act — and during that five

5

years these laws were to be frozen»

G

Negroes shall have five years — the

The past discrimination was to be there, and Negroes j

7

were to be able to vote and not as has occurred in this case,

8

to have to litigate the changes during that brief five-year

9

period while the changes were in effect»

50

Q

Do you think it was the object of the Congress to

11

suspend any new law and leave the old Mississippi laws that

12

had been on the books a long time in effect?

13

A

I believe that is what the Congress did, and it

14

provided a speedy mechanism to meet that situation which Your

15

Honor poses, by presentation of those laws to the Attorney

16

General or the state, of course, has the option nhfc to

17

present them to the Attorney General, but to go right to the

10

three-judge court of the District of Columbia,

i

/

In that event, the suit would be against the

19

20

Attorney General of the United States and X would respond

21

at this point that I would not be prepared to concede Your

22

Honor that the suit if logged in the District Court wouldbe

23

an appropriate location,

24

Q

Why wouldn't it, if the Constitution permitted it?

25

A

2 believe the decisions of this court

Q

I am not asking you any questions with any idea

that I think Congress does not have full power to pass its
own laws, and to have its courts judge their constitutionality.
A

I had no such thought in mind.

We do not read

the law to lodge a power in the Attorney General which is
an absolute power.
Q

He suspends the law, d©@sn3fe he?

A

The suspension of the lav? is in the hands of Congress

which did do it in Section 5.

I

The lav? was suspended and

the change was suspended the day the law was passed. That is
if there had been changes.
Q

The action of Mississippi in 1966 was suspended by

Congress, you mean?
A

1965, and the change between Novmeber 1, 1964 and August 6

cases in the south, and rot all in Mississippi»

12

were all pending, and this court had before it earlier that

13

year in January of 1965, the full records of the devices

14

which had been used to discriminate, and the way of

Judge John Brown of the Fifth Circuit, "The barring of one

A

Yes, but the problem presented to the Congress in

not?

A suspension would do that, would it

That would sanctify the old 3aw at that time?
A

Congress did not sanctify them, no.

Q

They suspended the law?

A

Yes.

We believe that the words, and the legislative

history,, and the initial interpretation of the statute by
•the Department of Justice, and the interpretations given
the statutes by three states who have submitted and by my review
of our files endeavored to comply with Section 5, that is
South Carolina, Virginia and George, fha interpretation of
those states indicate that the coverage that is contended
for in these three proceedings is the proper coverage.
The opposition position, that is, that the statute
reaches only the qualifications for registration, has
little support.

The appellees cite a statement by Assistant

Attorney General Burke Marshall, whose information and
knowledge of the statute I would very much regard ~~ Mr.
Marshall responded to a question of Congressman Cormaft,
who asked him, "Mr. Marshall, has the Department of Justice
given any consideration to the question of whether the statute
should address itself to the qualifications of candidates
for office?"
-SO»-

And Mr. Marshall responded, "The main problem

1

the bill addresses is the qualifications of voters.'5
Mow, that I think must be understood in the

3

context in which Mr. Marshall made the statement, and I think

5

it makes the point.

7

preclude registration by Negroes.

The bill addressed the problem that the

11

counties ~~ la Holmes at the time the Voting Rights Act

12

was passed, ther© were 100 plus parcent of the whites

13

registered, and .23 parcant of th© Negroes.
I looked at th© figure for early this year, 1968,

'14

15
1G
17

and in Holmes, today, it is still 100 plus percent of the
whites, but it is now 72 pereant of the Negroes, and the
Negroas have a majority.
In any event, Congress was suspending or excluding

I do.

Do you think that Act means that?

I think the Attorney General has a duty,

If that is true, the Congress froze all of the

election laws of the south, froze them for five years.

the words, “No person shall be denied the right to vote for

Congress recognised it created a right

in private persons to bring a suit to enjoin the enforcement
of one of these suspended statutes.

Without that provision,,

the private party would have to live under the changed
provision, and would have to travel the long route of litigatie
in a suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983, in which he would live under
the changed lav; and litigate it while the change was in
effect»
The privat® right of action permitted the plaintiff
to bring suit, to recognise the suspension of the statute.

th© 'three judge court provision where again a question of

words of tha statute we believe again shows that Congress

16

recognized that there would be other actions besides the

17

three judge action in the District of Columbia.

to

Th© evolution of th©

As th© Senate passed the bill, Section 5 referred

19

to the three judge court — or to tha declaratory action

20

required to b© brought, and then concluded in th© last

21

sentence, "Such an action shall fo® before three judges,"

22

I would have read that law, had it become tha

23

law passed by th© Congress, as limiting the requirement of

24

three judges to tha district court,

25

Indeed, I might also

hav© read it to limit or exclude any private right of action,
«5fr

However, the House did not accept the Senate

1
2

version, that such an action shall be before three judges,

3

and changed that language to read as it now reads in the

4

states, "Any action under this section", and ray understanding

5

©f the change in the language is that the Congress recognised

6

that there would and could ba implied private actions, and

7

provided that any such private action would foe foafor© a

S

three judge court.

9

Q

Suppose we don’t agree with that, and suppose we

10

think that although a right was conferred by Section 5 upon

11

the individual, the individual has to look elsewhere for

12

his cause of action?

13

A

That he has to bring it before a one judge court.

W© then could say he would have

to bring it before a one judge court.

If as 1 take it the

situation is her®, he is also challenging the constitutionality
of the state statute.
A

No, I would believe as Mr. Derfner said, that in

the case where he combines a section 5 claira with a claim
of unconstitutionality under the Fifteenth Amendment,
that the three judge court is properly convened.
Q

It is a sort of dependent jurisdiction?

A

The problem is not fully resolved in these three

cases Mr. Justice Forfeas, because in No. 25 and No. 26 the
plaintiffs dismissed the constitutional claim, so those cases
-

would not properly be here if a three judge court is not

Q

So they have to derive a three judge court

Q

You could say that Section 5 gives the petitioners

in 25 and 26 a right of action, or gives them a -right» But
it might follow that that right would have to be vindicated
before a single judge, except for the language yon pointed
to in Section 52
A

That is correct»

Q

Would you say that you did know about this

as of March of this year?
A

We would say the state is correct, and w© knew of

these changes as of that date, but we would say that the
Attorney General must rely upon th© formal procedures, and
that the submission of the change as submitted by th© chief
legal officer of the state or th© county, and that we follow
those formal procedures»
In the argument on South Carolina versus Katsenbach,
th® question of the six o* -clock to seven o'clock change by

'

South Carolina was raised in this, and Mr, Katzenbach

2

said that the United States has no objection to that change.

3

It is argued by appellees, that that ©-rhang© with this

4

court was an approval by the Attorney General of that

5

change and under the terms of Section 5,
In fact, I have reviewed the files of the

6
7

Department, and South Carolina, 15 days after the argument,

3

submitted that change in writing to the Attorney General,

9

and th© Attorney General responded in writing on April 1*

10

1966, saying that he had no objection to that change.

11

We must rely on the procedures that are established

12

by Section 5 and we do not £@©1 called upon, and indeed would

13

have considered it out of order to have expressed an objection

14

in a response to the clerk8s request for our view. That is

15

not the issue here ae has come out in the argument.

The merits of the changes are not an issue.

16

W®

17

have said in our brief, and I would say in oral argument,

13

that each of these thrs© changes imposes a serious question

19

of the Fifteenth Amendment violations.

Q

Mr. Poliak, if there is a privat® right of action

before a single judge, why shouldn’t th© question be limited
to just whether or not th© statute in question is coming
by Saction 5?
A

Rather than the Fifteenth Amendment, you mean?

Q

Because otherwise, doesn’t the Act contemplate that
59-

'i

the validity of that be passed upon by the Attorney General

2

or the District of Columbia court?

3

A

Yes, I believe that the posing of the validity

4

of the statute is envisioned by Section 14 of the law , to

5

be determined in the District Court for the District of

6

Columbia.
Q

7

Let us assume that in on© of these cases that a

No, a statute, a state statute, so that any new

13

state laws are unattackable on constitutional grounds in any

14

of the covered states in any of the district courts.
A

15

I don’t think that the statute withdraws power.

So, you say ther© should be a three judge court

19

A

That is the way w© understanding it, yes, sir.

20

Q

Mr. Poliak, before you sit down, would you mind

21

telling us what th© extent of the relief should be in this

22

case?

23

A

Th© Department of Justice has in prior cases

24

sought, not to upset election's that have previously been held,

25

and therefore, we would be loath to urge this court to
»61-

1

order the school superintendents who were appointed or the

2

county supervisors who were elected at large in Adams and

3

Forrest Counties that their elections be upset,

4

We would ask this court to declare the changed

laws ineffective respectively and to remand to the district

court for requirement of new elections,

Q

Thank you.

Could 1 ask you a question?

9

think,

This is beyond, 1

the purview of what we have before us, but I am just

io

interested as to what the Department’s view is.

ii
12

Do you think that the measure of an illegal device
'
is the constitutionality of the Fifteenth Amendment or do you

13

think it is broader?

.!

14

A

-

I believe the issue, if I understand your Honor,

15

in the three judge court for the District of Columbia, is

10

the constitutionality under the Fifteenth Amendment,

17

Q

You do?

13

A

Yes, sir,

19

Q

And the Act is broader than that?

20

A

Yes, and the Attorney General should apply Fifteenth

21

Amendment standards in offering that avenue.

a question posed by Senator Ervin.

It might help the court if X just related a

5

statistic which X assembled before I came, and it came up in

argument and it was alluded to by our counsel.

The Department has received 251 submissions under

Section 5.

.1965 from Alabama, a submission from the county in Mississippi

It has received one submission in November of

10

in 1966, and no submissions from the State of Louisiana.

11

We have received a number of submissions from the State of

12

George, a number or a few submissions from the State of

13

Virginia, and a rather large number of submissions from the

14

State of South Carolina.

15

The only occasions that the Department has had to

IQ

state that it could not consent was one case from the State

17

of George where the change was contrary in our judgment to

18

a prior court decision on the same issue.
The court decision was made after the Voting Rights

19

20

Act. There were two other cases from the State of Georgia

21

where inadvertently the changed

22

section of the Georgia law by reference, and that other section

23

provided for a test or device.

Well,, we have in no case — we must act within

I believe

Generally matters being what they are,

wa take most of the 60 days.

But there is no necessary

requirement that w® do so.

7

The question was raised in the argument on

Section 5 aspect of the Allen case, which Your Honors

9

heard yesterday, as t© the speed in which it could be done.

10

It seems to me that the Department of Justice ought to b©

11

capable of dealing with these things promptly.

12

Q

Mr. Poliak, let us assume that as you said frankly,

13

with respect to on® or more of the changes which are involved

14

here, you had no objection to them.

would approve it.

Let us assume that in the

suppose that I would want to change that.

But. 1 don’t think

13

that I can stray from the fact that in the state of matters
14
here it was entered into by th© State of Mississippi with
13

\
knowledge of the court’s decision in South Carolina, and with

16

knowledge that th© court had ruled that the law was suspended
17
and therefore, the court really faces a situation, as Your
13
Honor has already mentioned, that these laws have not been
19
in effect down there and they ar© not in effect now under

our reading of the statute,.

Q

That brings us back to the question asked by the

3

A

It is to remand

Well,, 1 stated that it should remand the case or

4

respectfully suggsist that it remands the case to the district

5

court with directions that the district court declare the

6

law not in effect until procedures of Section 5 are formed.

7
8

Q

'

People now hold office as a result of these laws ,

so w® have to think a little bit beyond that.
A

Well, perhaps I will answer your question, but

10

perhaps 1 should also ask to frame a paper and submit it to

11

the court with a careful statement of what the relief should

12

be.
Not being the plaintiff parties in the case,, the

13
14

15
16

government has not spelled out that.
Q

That would be helpful to me, if you would like to

do that in your position as amicus.

17

Q

Would you do that for us?

18

A

l?as, Mr. Chief Justice , we will do that.

Of course, serve it on the other side, too.

Oh, yes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. ALLAIN
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. ALLAINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

24

court, w© are a little bit concerned ourselves about the

25

type of relief which the appellants want to ask for.
*

66

»

1

2
3
4
5

We were under the impression, at first they
wanted to set aside the elections held in November and
have new elections.

In view of the position they ha-<© taken

today, we fael that maybe on© of the most important questions
before the court is whether or not this issue is moot, whether

6

or not the submission by this court to the Attorney General

7

and in the submission by us in our response brief to their

8

brief, gave them the information and gave them the notice that

9

is requirad by Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act,

10
11
12

We say it is.

W@ know of no formal submission that

has to be mad© to the Attorney General's office.
Q

Do you think anything of the Attorney General's

13

statement, that indicates that he approved or disapproved

14

of these laws?

IS

A

No, sir, I think that there is nothing in the

IS

brief and in fact, he states in his brief that he is

17

reserving unto himself the right to approve or disapprove

18

at a later date.

19

We say to that assertion, h© cannot reserve unto

20

himself longer than 60 days which Congress itself has placed

21

in the Act as the time in which h© must make some kind of

22

determination.

23

Now, ha speaks of a formal writing,

I know of no

24

directive that the Attorney General's office has put out on

25

how we shall submit to the Attorney General our new laws.
-67

And just because some of the other states have
submitted them in on© manner or the other is not binding
upon the Stato of Mississippi, nor is it controlling as to
what Congress really intended to do.
Q

But this case can't be moot unless you lose the

firsto
A

Your Honor, it would be moot if they have withdrawn

their request for the relief which they have asked for.
It was my understanding of the position taken by counsel
opposite, counsel for the appellant and not the amicus
in this case, that as far as they were concerned what they
war© really asking for, was for this court to tell Mississippi,
submit this to the Attorney General3s office and let him
approve or disapprove.
Now, we say this court cannot command nor direct
the State of Mississippi to do something which is beyond
the scope of the Act itself.

We say at this late day, this

has already been don©, exactly what appellant wants.

It has
i

been submitted to the Attorney General of the United States;
and he has not exercised his prerogative within the 60 days.
Q

The State of Mississippi has not yet submitted it.

I think that your position as stated in your brief is
that this court submit it to the Attorney General?
A

That is correct.

Q

That was not what the statute says.
“ 6&

The statute

?
2

says that the state shall submit it.

When we submitted our response to their brief, at

that time, we put them on notice through the Attorney General's

4

office.

5

Q

6

"submit".

It doesn't say, "Put on notice."

It says

the statute really means by ‘’submit".

Does it mean by telephone

10

by passing on th© street and we met the Attorney General

n

and saying, "We have) a new law."

12

Q

Has Mississippi done anything?

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

By March of this year, to get in touch with the

15

Attorney General by meeting him on the street or mailing

16

or anything els©?

17

A

W© have submitted, Your Honor, in our hdef, and

18

h© has been put on notice, and that is th© only submission

19

that we have made.

that did happen, ©nd this is a submission or at least the

21

Attorney General’s office accepted it as so.

me, and he said, "We have known through the paper or otherwise
that this constitutional amendment had been approved."

We have never submitted it.
And I said, "Yes."

?

And he said, "Is it in the Constitution?"

8

And I said, "Yes".

9
10

He said, "Is that true?"

And he said, "W© will now notify the federal
registrars to us© that as a qualification."

II.

That is submission and that is approval.
12
13

Your Honor, X don't know of any formality.

I don't

see how the Attorney Generale s office can stand here today

14

and say there is soma formality when they have acquiesced

15

in a change which cam® about after November 1, 1984, when I

16

have submitted it over a telephone conversation, and 'they

1?

through their officials and agents have put it into effect.

IS

That, Your Honor, we think, is actually Section

19

5, it is more of an informal thing, and it must be tied into

20

whether or not a private suit can be brought.

21

or on behalf of Mississippi; then I take it that you haven’t

got anything to argue about here.

You still say that the

Yes, w© could say that because it would be a mooted

the relief requested; so I think; has been withdrawn as

11

far as the appellants are concerned,

Do you agree that the Act covers the various

alleged tests and devices that are in issue in these cases?

A

No, Your Honor,

15

Q

Therefor®; you don’t agree that they have been

16
17
18

submitted to the Attorney General?
A

What we are saying; Your Honor, is this;

We don't

believe we had to submit,

19

Q

Do you or do you not?

20

A

No, but we do not believe we had to submit it, but

21

it was submitted, and therefor©, it is a mooted issue, and

22

there is nothing left for this court to decide,

It was submitted by the Clerk of the Court, if that

is what you mean,

"Since Section 5!s approval procedure was designed

12

to serve an informing function—-to provide ’a method of bringing

13

to the attention of the Government changes in state law'.”

14

We again submit that this was merely to keep the

IS

Attorney General from roaming all over the Southern States

16

affected by the '65 Voting Rights Act and trying to find out

17
IS
19

every time when a new law in regard to voting was put into
effect in these States.
It is page 15 of our brief.

That is in No. 25.

It

20

means that we seriously urge to the court that the informing

21

that the Attorney received in this case was sufficient by the

22

legislative history, by the intent of Congress, by the inter­

23

pretation placed upon that section by the Attorney General’s

24
25

Office themself, that there was no need for any formal type
of notice given to the Attorney General’s Office.
73»

We would further invite the court * s attention to

I
2

page 22 of the Memorandum of the United States amicus in which

3

in this particular brief and on page 22 thereof they admit or

4

seera to admit that the Section 5 applies to reapportionment or

5

to redistricting like we have in this particular case before

6

the court today.
Then they say, "The most that can be assumed from

7
Q

past silence is that the Attorney General was not prepared to

9

impose an objection to the changes being effected and, thus,

10

declined to seek to compel a state or political subdivision to

11

comply with what would have in all likelihood be a whooly

IE

formalistic step that would merely have delayed final imple­

13

mentation of a constitutional required restructuring of
v

14

They are admitting there that as far as they are

concerned there may be other areas in which there has been a
restructuring of Government and they didn't feel that they

with Mr. Justice Brennan’s remarks and I think Mr. Justice
White's remarks that it is not for the Attorney General to
make that decision whether or not they are going to be sus­

they come within the purview of Section 5, they submit to the

we ought to take any steps to make them do that.

I assume if we accepted your argument that the

Attorney General really has been informed when 60 days has
gone by, then the plaintiffs are in shape to challenge these
laws directly in the District Court as to their constitution­
ality?
A

I would take that position, Mr. Justice White,

because we take the position that they do not come under the
*65 Voting Rights Act.
This court was to hold or if the position was taken
as the Appellants apparently are taking that it does come
under the '65 Voting Rights Act, then they could not challenge
it in a local District Court.

until March of this year these particular Mississippi statutes
were suspended and then 60 days after March because the
Attorney General didn’t take any action they get new life?
That would be an anomalous situation?
76

A

No, I think it would be more of the fact that they

2

didn’t take any action, more or less approval of it, and.

3

Congress intended it to be more or less retroactive, that they

4

would become effective as of that date»

There is nothing that you have shown me so far that

says the Attorney General knew about this before March?

That is right»

So he hadn’t approved it before March?

To my knowledge, he had not, sir»

So then it was suspended because it hadn’t been

My feeling in it, your Honor, would be that if a law

13

was passed or put into effect and it was submitted to him and

U

he has the 60 days, that even if he didn’t act within that
i

15

time or he approved it that it would be more or less retro-

16

active and that it would become effective as of the time in whioi

17

it was put into effect.

But you are relying on the fact that he didn’t dis­

approve it within 60 days?

To my argument, your Honor, yes.

As of whatever date that is?

S

Q

So he had not passed on it one way or the other?

At that time.

7

He had not had an opportunity under the statute to

pass on it because it hadn't been quotes submitted?

9

Until submitted by this court.

So then it was suspended?

11

But he is not acting upon it, your Honor.

I would like to say this:

In the outset, counsel

for the opposite placed quite a bit of their time and effort

discussing the ratio of Negro to white, discussing the counties

9

how the make-up was, and so forth.

10

I would be less than honest with this court if I was

11

to stand before it and say, "There is no ratio overtones here;

12

that until I came here today I didnst realize that race was

13

one of the prime movements of this particular lawsuit."

14

But I will say this:

Before this court, race is not

there has been limited discussion of as of this time and

Because there is no

I would like to say this

1

regard to a question posed by Mr. Justice Fortas:

z

this court decided in the Aubrey versus Midland County, Texas,

3

Case that the rationale of the Reynolds versus Sims goes down

4

to the local level.
That was the first time this court had actually made

5

S

We know that

that pronouncement.
April 11, 1966, shown in Appellee’s brief at page 15

7
&

in No. 25 —- let us get these dates, your Honor, -- April 11 ,

0

1966, the Chief Judge of the Southern District of Mississippi,

10

Judge Harold Cox, in the case of Crosby versus Pearl River,

11

Pearl River County in which a suit was filed to command that

12

supervisor to redistrict, the motion to dismiss was filed on

1.3

the grounds that the rationale of the Reynolds did not come

14

that far down.
He found that it did.

15
16

On April 11, 1966, he found

that it did and he directed Pearl River County to redistrict.

17

Other suits were filed, and the legislature did not pass this

IS

Act until May 27, 1966.

19

Having put on notice that the District Courts of the

20

Southern District of Mississippi felt that the reapportionment

21

decision did go down to the county level.
Your Honors would have to be familiar with some of

22
23

2.4
25

the counties of Mississippi to realize.

We don't have any

debates in the legislative history v'hich we can bring before
the court.

But many of the counties in Mississippi cannot be
82-

redistricted for the simple reason that the population might
be grouped up in the Southern area or the Northern area like
in Hines County, the Jackson group up in the Northeastern
Section.
So the legislature felt that they must do something,,,
put on notice by the District Court that they were going to
apply this court's decision in the Reynolds Case to allow
these counties to do something to comply with it.
There is just an impossibility in many of the
Mississippi Counties, I would say in many counties throughout
the United States, to actually draw off lines, rational lines,
and put the population where they would not he wifchixi a
certain percent of the ratio in the districts.
Q

Why would that be?

h

Because of the way that the population is grouped up

in one area — we must not only take into consideration I think
this court has said we don't have to take into consideration
the complete population — you would have all the county
grouped up there ami the people down here having very little
representation.
Q

Because they have very few people?

A

There are a number of people scattered throughout

that area, your Honor, but of different, diverse and types of
economics, maybe farmers and blue-collared workers here and up
in this area white collared workers and your wealthier people.
-83

It has been shown just by surveys through survey

1

2

companies that it is almost ian impossibility in some of the

3

counties for us to really redistrict.

4

as I read the decisions have placed in the Virginia Beach Case

5

its stamp of approval upon the very things which these two

6

counties have done and also made mention and I guess reapproved

7

the Virginia Beach Case in the Aubrey versus Midland County,

8

Texas Case.

Of course-, this court

So what I was trying to get before the Court was that;

9
I©

irrespective of what counsel might have thought was a reason

11

for doing there, was good, concrete reasons existing in

n

Mississippi's District Courts

13

Q

As you say, this is all really irrelevant?

14

A

That is true.

15

Q

Why do we waste your time on it?

18

A

Your Honor, because the counsel I guess spent so much

17

time on it that there were quite a number of questions from

18

the Court and the Bench in that regard.

19

Q

We will never get to the merits.

2©

A

I was merely answering a question posed by Justice

2!

Portas when he was I think asked if there had been any commands

22

by the District Courts or by any courts to redistrict.
I was answering that question and on July 27, 1966,

23
24

the three-judge district court had called upon one of the

25

counties.

That was prior to what was done in Adams and in
-

84~

i 1

Forest Counties.

2

Moving on from that question, your Honor, we come to

3

the question which was actually raised or not raised but urged

4

by this court and that is the jurisdictional question, one

5

in which the Government was asked to file a brief? whether or

6

not this court has jurisdiction because there was properly

1

convened a three-judge district court in Mississippi»

8
0

We are all in accord, I think, on this one principis.
How do you read the last sentence of Section 5 of the *65

10

Voting Rights Act?

n

this section — I am quoting from page 6 of our brief — ’’Any

12

Action under this section shall ba heard and determined by a

13

court of three judges."

U

It is just that simple, "Any action under

We say that that sentence was merely referring to

15

the subject matter that is referred to in Section 5.

The only

16

subject matter referred to in Section 5, the only action re­

17

ferred to in Section 5 by the court, is a declaratory judgment

18

in the District Court of Washington, D, C.

19

That is when if first we have submitted our new laws

20

to the Attorney General's Office and he has refused to approve

21

them and then we file our case in the Washington, D. C. Court,

22

or if we wanted to bypass for some reason -— I don't know what

23

reason we might have — the Attorney General's Office, we
proceed originally in the Washington, D. C. Court.
That is the only court action which Section 5 or the

subject matter of Section 5 is concerned with.

3

to the declaratory relief or declaratory judgment in the

4

Washington, D„ C. court and this court does not have juris­

S

diction because the three-judge district court in the Southern

6

District of Mississippi was improperly convened.

7

We say to the

If any action lies at all, forgetting about all the

8

other technicalities, the jurisdiction would have been in a

9

one-judge district court.

10

As I say, of course, we will admit that it does not

11

necessarily compel as Justice Harlan said, in the Swift Case

12

a reading of that but it is a more appropriate reading.

13

The rationale of the Swift Case was in construing 228.'

14

chat any time we construe any section which gives jurisdiction

13

through a three-judge court we should construe it in a limited

IS

manner to keep from placing the burden upon three judges and

17

the Appellate Court.

18

Counsel opposite says that it is appropriate.

Why

19

is it appropriate?

20

concern of Congress that we have here a clash between the

21

State of Mississippi and Appellants on what we can enforce and

22

what we cannot enforce.

23

Because of the rationale of 2281 and the

Of course, that isn3t true.

That was laid to rest in

24

the Swift Case.

25

between the State of Mississippi and its laws on a constitu­
tional ground.

We are not really concerned with a clash

We are merely concerned with the same clash that you.
V

2

found in the Swift Case, whether there is a supremacy clause

3

and whether or not what we have done in Mississippi is in

4

disregard to an Act of Congress,
So it does not rise to the dignity of what Congress

5
6

was worried about when they enacted 2281.

It does not rise

7

to the dignity of a one-judge district court enjoining the

8

operation of a state law on unconstitutional grounds and as

this court held in the Phillips Case, if we are merely talking

10

about whcit an individual was unconstitutionally applying the

11

law, even in that case we would not have this situation.

16

Q

Yes.

17

A

Your Honor, when you go to the Washington, D. C.

18

Court, you go up there as a petitioner.

19

this:

20

that this law was not passed for the purpose and effect of

21

denying someone their constitutional voting rights because of

22

race.

The burden of proof rests on you.

But you have to prove

It is a Fifteenth Amendment question in that sense.

Attorney General Katzenbach which we have cited in our brief

in our brief between the remedies and rights.

some kind of a right to enforce Section 5, they have another

jurisdictional statute which they have alluded to which they

have asserted in their complaint? that they have been denied

some right given to them by Congress.
But we are merely talking about what did Congress

mean about "Is that a right under this pursuant to, or is it

pursuant to a general jurisdictional statute of a right which

was investigated under Section 5?"

As this court said in the South Carolina Case speaking

14

15

through the Chief Justice, that this Act created new and

16

stringent remedies, that this Act cind Congress had marshaled

17

an array of weapons to be used effectively by the United States ,

18

Q

For what purpose?

19

A

For the purpose, your Honor, of, one, seeing that

no one is denied in the future any of their constitutional

past.

Q

For the vindication of those?

10

A

For the vindication and placed them in the hand of

11

what body?

The Attorney General.

Why?

Because it is a public

12

interest we are talking about here and not just an individual

13

interest.

14

It is rather odd that the Government at this time

15

takes the position that a private party can bring a lawsuit

16

when in the Apache County, Arizona. Case which we have cited

17

in our brief, they say the responsibility, the complete re­

18

sponsibility, rests with the Government and in that particular

19

case, they tried to keep some of the Indians in Arizona from

20

intervening because they said,, "No, you don't have any right

21

in this lawsuit.

22

We are vindicating a public right."

In their brief they took the position that the

23

responsibility rests in the Attorney General.

24

as one of the sections, Section 5.

25

They set out

As Justice Black said in his dissent in regard to

Section 5, this is something new in the law.

2

that is harsh in the law,

As this court said, it is harsh.

But harsh means when necessary.

This is something

Therefore, we don’t

4

believe that Congress would have placed this type of action,

S

this type of remedy in just at the whim of any individual who

8

wanted to bring a lawsuit and say, "Look, you haven’t gone up

7

to the Attorney General's Office for it."
Look at the ramifications that might come from there.

8
9

Let us assume we went to the Attorney General's Office and

10

said with the Act itself, "Mr, Attorney General, here is the

?!

Act, read it and give us a written opinion,"
And he says after he reads it, "That is fine, I have

12

13

no objection to it."
I dont know of any publication of that.

14

I don't know

15

how any citizen is going to know about that.

16

in Mississippi or Alabama, Virginia or anybody who comes within

17

the Act, can then say, "I am going to bring a lawsuit because

General would do his duty.

Couldn't they assume and couldn’t Congress assume

that was within the purview of the ’65 Voting Rights Act.

17

getting back to your Honor's question, what would the indi­

the same type of freezing principle.

Yet nobody asked the

Because everybody in those hearings, the President on down,

17

directly affected the vote.
They were talking about tests and devices and then

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILL S. WELLS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

22
23

MR. WELLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

24

Court, the first matter I wanted to discuss 4a, No. 36, if

25

the Court please.
103

I

This case was originally brought, challenging the

z

amendment of the section involved on two grounds:

3

it was unconstitutional, and the other was that it was a

4

violation of Section 5.

5
8

One, that

The constitutional issue was completely taken out
of the case in its entirety by stipulation.

7

I believe Mr. Justice Marshall asked counsel this

&

morning first why he took it out»

9

at that time because we were trying to get a hurried decision."

He said, "We took it out

10

The present counsel was not member of the counsel

11

at the time this matter was brought and heard at that time.

12

I heard it from its inception, but this stipulation

13

was entered into at the request of plaintiffs themselves, and

14

was actually drawn by plaintiffs’ counsel at that time.

15

Mr. Derfner aame along after all of those matters were passed.

16

So the only question here, as I see it, in this case,

17

is this:

18

5 of the Voting Rights Act?

ID

Does this statute come within the purview of Section

It was not submitted to the Attorney General, nor

20

was it submitted to the Court of theDistrict of Columbia,

21

because we did not feel that it came within the purview of

22

the Act, or required to be.

23

The Court might note in the stipulation which is

24

found on pages 38 and 39 of the Appendix in No. 36, but I

25

was willing to stipulate with the counsel that theState of
104-

-

8

1

Mississippi, in enacting the bill of 1968, Mississippi Laws

2

of 1966, which amended Section 326 of this Code, did not

3

comply with the provisions of 42 USC 1973C, which is Title 5.

4

5

It has not. been submitted to the Attorney General,
or to the District of Columbia.

&

This is not to be construed as a concession by the

7

defendants that the State of Mississippi was under any lawful

8

obligation to so comply with the provisions of that section.

9

Q

What page is that?

10

A

That is at the bottom of page 38 in Appendix A,

is

Appendix in No. 36.
In other words, we took that position from the

12

13

start.

14

Q

May I ask, Mr. Wells, how does that affect this

15

case right at the present time, the fact that you refused to

16

acknowledge that it should go to the Attorney General?

1?
13

A

Because I have taken the position as I go through to

explain why I don't think it is.

19

0

You are going to explain now?

20

A

Yes, sir.

"Mr. Carman” — he was talking to Mr. Burt Marshall,

10

who at that time was an Assistant Attorney General and one

11

of the chief architects of this very Civil Rights Act, which

12

was drawn as a matter of common knowledge at the recommenda­

13

tion and at the request of the President of the United States,

14

as he told the Joint Session of Congress.

15

"Mr» Gorman,

We have not talked at all about whether

1S

we have to be concerned with not only who can vote, but who

17

can run for public office, and that has been an issue in some

18

areas in the South in 1964.

19

"Have you given any consideration to whether or not

20

this bill ought to address itself to the qualifications for-

21

running for public office, et cetera?

22

"Mr. Marshall.

The problem that the bill was aimed

23

at was the problem of registration. Congressman.

24

a problem of another sort, I would like to see it corrected,

25

but that is not what we were trying to deal with in this bill."

14

run as an independent, and the Court said he had a right to

15

do that as a candidata, because there was no statute against

16

him»
It had to be done by legislation, so it was that if

17
18

you vote in a primary election

that is going to nominate

19

candidates to run for office, you have got to run in that pri­

20

mary if you want to, but if you vote in that primary, then you

I think it affects his right to run for office, but not his

It may be that

legislature intended to affect

That was what was happening.

But that had been happening.

It had no

They deliberately say,

11

and said, "Let's get together.

He is the weakest man.

We

will vote for him in the primary, and then run somebody els®

in the general."

14

Q

The Republicans have constitutional rights, too.

15

h

Yest sir, they do.
I want to say in that connection that I think this

16

election is going to show they also are a little bit stronger

18

than they were.
If the Court ple&se, we go to the other legislative

history in this matter.
All their hearings, everything, the whole colloquy,

we are* talking about through this thing, is the right to vote,

that we make, as far as this case is concerned,,

As to the Bunfcon ballot case, which has to do with

3

the appointment of superintendents of education, 1 can say

4

to the Court quite honestly that that has given me quite a

lot of concern.

May I just ask — I take it to the extent that this

not raise it, does he?

No.

Q

When you change from election — I mean when a

SI

statute that changes from an elected method to an appointed

12

method, would not be a reapportionment case?

S3

A

Not whatsoever.

14

Here is the situation, if the Court please.

15

First, I call the Court's attention in those cases

16

you have not the three counties involved.

17

alluded to as 11, you have got three counties, Clayburn,

18

Jefferson, and Holmes.

19

Although they are

20

voters in Jefferson County, and desire to run for superinten­

22

on behalf of ourselves and in place of all other voters and

23

potential candidates in Jefferson County."

24
25

We bring this suit

in Holmes County.

12

Somebody comes along and doesn't want to go through

13

that in his country, and introduces an amendment to amend it,

14

and provide that in my county it will be automatic, and some­

15

body else says, "I want to get included, too," and that is

13

the way those things go.

17

Q

You don’t know, and I don’t know, and nobody in this

Would Mississippi be happier, too?

Mr. Derfner*

IS

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARMANI) DERFNER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

17

MR. DERFNER:

13

If it please the Court, the position

19

of all the appellants on the question of relief is as follows:

20

We believe that Section 5 imposed an additional requirement

21

for putting into effect the State statute within its coverage,

22

that in the absence of fulfilling that requirement, the

23

statute was not in effect,and it was as if no statute had been

24

passed.

25

Therefore, we believe that since the statutes in
114-

-

1

these cases have been void and are now void,, that we are

2

entitled to new elections with respect to relief, as well as

3

prospective relief the day this Court reverses the judgments

4

below.

5
6

At that point, the proper relief would be for the
Court to remand the Court below toward new elections.

7

We don't think it is the job of this Court or the

8

Court below to tell the State what to do about whom to submit

9

the statute to, about whether to submit the statute at all,

10

about what to do if it wishes to put the statute into effect.
If the State wishes to submit the statute to some­

11

\2

body and come back to the Court before such time as was fixed

13

promptly for holding a new election, then that court might

14

within the exercise of its discretion decide to, if there

15

were a favorable determination to the State, not to hold a

16

new election.
But we think that the court below should proceed

17
18

expeditiously to hold new elections, that those new elections

19

should be held.

20

Q

Do you think there is any analogy — you know in

21

many reapportionment cases, the Court has thought it was

22

malapportionment, when an election was coming up, where the

23

Court has sanction of the conduct of the election, although

24

under a malapportioned system, because of the difficulty of

25

getting these corrected before the election came along —- we
“'

115

=”

1

did have that in several cases.

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

Don?t you suppose here you have situations which are

4
5

now past?
A

Yes, but at the time these cases were brought, in

6

each case the proper thing for the court below to have done, and

7

the convenient thing, in all cases, would be to grant.

8
9

Q

The court didn't.

We are faced with a fact

and

theory.
I am wondering.

10

My question was; don’t you see any

11

analogy at all as to what we have done in the reapportionment

12

cases?

13

A

Yes, I do, but I think as Hamer versus Campbell,

14

Fifth Circuit case, one of the considerations in exercising

15

the equitable jurisdiction of the court is how difficult it

16

would have been at that time, how disruptive it is now, but

17

we think it is quite within the equity jurisdiction of

18

this Court and the court below to be ordered to go back to the

19

situation as it stood at that time.

20
21

Q

You think we should do that?

We should order the

District Court to restore the status quo as quickly as can be?

22

A

Yes.

23

Q

Which necessarily involves, I suppose, the ousting

24
£5

of the people and a new election under the old laws?
A

That is right.
-

116-

1

Q

Don * t you think, Mr. Derfner, that it is arguable,

%

at least, that there: is less reason for doing that in this

3

case than in the reapportionment cases, for the simple reason

4

that in reapportionment cases we held that the apportionment

5

was unconstitutional, yet we gave them a chance to remedy it.

6

In this case, where all that is asked is that the

7

procedure be submitted to the Attorney General, without regard

8

to whether it is unconstitutional or not, it might be a better

9

judgment to make our remedy prospective in this case, and

5

because the Attorney General might say, "No, that is all right.

51

There is no constitutional infirmity here.

52

election is all right."

13

A

54

to do.

j

Therefore, the

I think we have to look at what the statute is meant

The submission to the District Court for the District

55
16

of Columbia, or to the Attorney General, is not regarded as

17

a formalistic matter.

18

Q

No.

I didn’t mean that.

19

A

It was regarded as something of great substance.

It

2

was regarded as a way of making certain that this statute has

21

had as close as possible to the automatic affect, as we said

22

in South Carolina versus Katzenbach.

23

It doesn't, seem to me that Congress in seeking to

24

pass as automatic as possible a trigger statute which would

25

have meant to allow these rights to be delayed so long.
”

117

“

1

I might say, what I tried to say before in connection

2

with the lower court’s equity jurisdiction, if the Court orders

3

new elections, I think if the State would go to the Attorney

4

General and get the favorable determination before those

5

elections took place, it would be well within the equitable

G

jurisdiction of the court below to set aside the elections»
I am saying the Court’s procedures should go on,

7
8

and whatever can be done by the States within such reasonable

9

time as exists before the election, which almost certainly

10

would include the time to get a favorable response, if one

11

were forthcoming from the Attorney General, could be effective.

12

But I don't think that the Court should wait until

13

the State has a chance to seek a declaratory judgment in the

14

District of Columbia and then appeal that to this Court.
By that time, what

15
16

years of the operation of the statute eaten up by the States.
I don’t think that is what Congress intended.

17
18

we have had is close to the five

Q

Is it your position, then, that xf we follow you,

19

that we remand this case and require the matter to be submitted

20

to the Attorney General and call for elections?

21

22
23
24
25

A

No, Your Honor.

I believe this Court in its proper

order should direct the court below to call for new elections.
What the State wishes to do in the way of sub­
missions, or to whom it wishes to submit, is up to the State.
If the State wishes to submit, it may do so.
-

118-

If it

i

gets an answer in time before the election, it would certainly

2

have time to do that, that, is fine, but if the State does not

3

wish to submit

4

doesn't need to submit.

it might decide, as in the Dunton case, it

It is not up to this Court or the court below to

5

6

suggest to the State what it should do by its obligations under

7

Section. 5«

approved it, then they would be statutes

13
14

16

17

18
19

A

22

23

I think in that event, if the court below

even at this late date, indicated that the State's error
was in effect harmless, I think that would be quite consistent
with this Court's mandate, because it would say that this
great duty of the State is not merely formalistic duty,
though it had not been done before, had been done now, in the
way that showed that the statute was proper, and could be
put into effect.
But we are talking about in a sense some of these
things don’t fit tightly into logical boxes, but we think we
are talking about the most practical way of solving the
statute px'oblern.
Q

25

No.

decided that in its equitable discretion that the approval,

20
21

operating under

mandate, wouldn't they?

1!

12

If we order elections, and the Attorney General

it:

May I ask you if this is another way of getting at

The possible directive might be that unless the State
-119-

1

chooses to submit the matter to the Attorney General, or the

z

United States District Court in the District of Columbia,, and

3

unless after said submission a favorable response is given to

4

the State by the Attorney General or the courts, rather than

5

calling the District Court to order a new election.
Is that a proper way?

6
7

A

No, Justice Fortas, not quite, because we are willing i

8

to do that in connection with the Attorney General, submission

9

to the Attorney General, because as a practical matter, there

10

would be time to get a response from the Attorney General

11

before any new election were held.
We are willing to do that, because we don't believe

12

13

that would hold anything up.
We are not willing to agree that relief should be

held up until a submission •—
Q

You are raising a question as to whether or not we

should in effect, as a penalty, with regard to the State action
here, compel the State to go to the Attorney General rather
than to pursue what is the statutory alternative, namely, to
go to the District Court for the District of Columbia?
A

We think the baseline, JusticeFortas, is that

the State is not entitled to put this statute in effect, and
the State had no statute until such time as it complied.
We think the Court has equitable discretion to
essentially give the State more than it is entitled to, but not
