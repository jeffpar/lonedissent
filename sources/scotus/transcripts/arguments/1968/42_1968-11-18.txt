MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

The next case is Shuttlesworth

versus the City of Birmingham* Alabama, No. 42.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG
COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Justice Black and may it please

the Court, this case is here on petition for certiorari to the
Supreme Court of Alabama, which reversed the Alabama Court of
Appeals, which in turn had reversed the Circuit Court of
Jefferson County, which had convicted this petitioner for
violating a Birmingham ordinance requiring a permit before a
procession or parade may be held.
This petitioner, Fred Shuttlesworth, was sentenced
to 90 days in jail, plus 48 days in lieu of paying a fine and
costs, for parading in violation of this ordinance ■which appears:
on page 4 of our brief.
Q

When was the conviction, in 1963?

A

This was in 1963.

Q

How in the world has it taken this long to get

h

Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, the case was tried in

up here?

Recorder’s Court in May of 1963, and the Circuit Court in
October of 1963.
And appeal was promptly taken to the Alabama Court
of Appeals which did not decide the case until 1965.
2

The

Stats of Alabama then took it to the Alabama Supreme Court
which did not decide the case until November of 1967, and we
promptly took it here.
The time was essentially spent in the very lengthy
consideration or very lengthy time that was consumed while the
case was pending before the two Alabama courts.
The ordinance in question which appears on page 4 of
our brief states that it shall be unlawful to organize or hold
or assist in organizing or holding a parade or procession or
other public demonstration unless a permit has been secured,
and then it sets forth standards according to which the permit
may be granted or denied.
Those standards include, beginning on the very last
line on page 4 of our brief, public welfare, peace, safety,
health, decency, good order, morals or convenience.
As I stated, this arose in 1963, and this is what one
might call a prototype case.

This is the case of the one

petitioner whose conviction has been appealed and there are
approximately 1500 other cases pending in the Juvenile Court
©nd the Circuit Court of Jefferson County awaiting disposition
of this case.
The case arose out of what one might call a classical
type of civil rights march.
Q

How many cases did you say?

A

Approximately 1500, with about 900 in the
3

j

1

Juvenile Court and 600 in the Circuit Court are being held,

2

pending the outcome of this case.
Q

3

How is that possible?

I thought there were only

15 marchers.

4

A

5

Well, other persons were prosecuted for viola­

6

tion of: this ordinance.

This occurred during the series of

7

demonstrations in Birmingham in 1963, which ultimately led to the

8

passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and there were a series

§

of demonstrations and marches over a period of some time, while

10

there were 52 parsons arrested in this particular demonstration

11

there were 1500 altogether.
Civil Rights marches are what one might call a olassij-

12
13

cal type of Civil Rights March.

The group of marchers which

14

Petitioner Shuttlesworth, with which he was connected, left

15

the church at approximately 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon.

16

They walked on the sidewalks.

17

There is no question about that at all.

They were entirely orderly.

They proceeded approximately four or somewhat more

18
19

than four blocks and then they were stopped by police officers

20

who asked whether or not they had a permit and when they said

21

they did not have a permit they were arrested.
I might state that the Respondent’s brief is written

22
23

in an effort or written as if this were some sort of disorderly

24

conduct or breach of the peace case.
The fact is the petitioners were not prosecuted for

25

4
I

1

anything of the sort.

2

without a permit»

3 i

of Appeals w7hich has been adopted essentially by the Supreme

4 j

Court of Alabama is express on the fact that the petitioners

5 |

were orderly.

6

They were prosecuted for parading

The opinion of Judge Johnson in the Court

The testimony of police officers is unequivocal

7

that they were orderly.

8

there is some dispute as to whether or not the on-lookers were

9

disorderly.

There was a group of on~lookers,

They were, however, a discrete group and even

10

the alleged disorder which came out of the conduct of the

11

on-lookers occurred after the arrest.

12

I don’t think that it can be seriously contested or

13

contended at all that these petitioners acted in violation of

14

any disorderly conduct or breach of the peace statute, and

15

indeed they have not been prosecuted for that.
Now Judge Gait's opinion in the Alabama Court of

16
17

Appeals itfhich reversed the conviction of the trial court is a

18

lengthy opinion, appearing at page 88 of the record.

19

it is summarized in his conclusion in a brief section on

20

page 143.

21

However,

His position was that the permit ordinance is un­

22

constitutional because it is vague, and includes such terms as

23

welfare, decency, and good morals, which are not susceptible

24

to any precise meaning.

25

records in several other Alabama cases he held that the pattern

Relying upon judicial notice of

5

1

of enforcement, that is, prosecuting these petitioners for walking

2

down the sidewalk was discriminatory in the sense of Yick Wo

3

against Hopkins and he also held in his third point that there

4

was no need shown, no State interest shown in enforcing an

S

ordinance of this sort against persons who ware merely walking

6

down the sidewalk.

7

The dissenting opinion of Judge Johnson which was

8

adopted and without any variation really by the Alabama Supreme

9

Court consisted essentially of reconstruction of the statute

10

in the mode of Cox against New Hampshire.

11

and he said, if the statute contains the word decency, and

12

morals, and welfare and the various other vague terms, but I

13

read all of those words out of the statote so those words are

14

no longer there, and now I am going to read something into the

IS

statute, and after having read that out he read into the

16

statute those traffic considerations and considerations that

17

avert to convenience of the publich, which was the basis of

18

the Cox decision and the Supreme Court of Alabama said that is

19

right, we read out the bad words and read in some good words,

20

and therefore the conviction stands.

£1

He read the statute

Now, our position in this case in summary is that

22

under the decisions of this Court, it uniformly has been held

23

that a permit ordinance which imposes a prior restraint on

24

First Amendment rights may be disobeyed with impunity if it is

25

unconstitutional on its face.

6

1

This Court held that in Staub against Baxley and in

2

Lovell against Griffin and in case after case since then.

3

There seems to be conceded that the language in question just

4

to take three of the terms, welfare, decency and morals, are

5

so vague that they ought to be unconstitutional, and indeed

6

that is why they were read out of the statute by Judge Johnson

7

and by the Alabama Supreme Court.

8
0

There is the question of the Cox case.

j

Our position

on the Cox case and I will come to it in a moment, it is that

10

it is distinguishable and that in any event it did not take

11

into account and did not discuss certain due process consider- j

12

ations appearing which are central to this petition.

‘33

14
15
m

Q
A

Which Cox case is that?
I will be speaking about the Cox against

New Hampshire, yes.
Q

You don't claim there is anything unconstitu­

17

tional as such in the state of having a permit requirement for

18

a parade, would you?

19

A

Oh, no, providing that it meets certain sub­

20

stantive and we might add certain procedural standards, and we

21

say that this statute as rewritten, even if it were consfci-

22

tional as rewritten, first cannot be applied to convict this

23

petitioner who acted before it was rewritten, and secondly we

24

claim it is not constitutional because it does not provide

25

I

for a speedy review and certain standards and record keeping
7

1

requirements and so forth,, that would be necessary upon review.

2

Secondly, we claim that five years after the event

3

this statute cannot be reconstructed without violating fair

4

notice.

S

distinguished from the procedural sense, such a rewritten

6

statute might be constitutional.

7

To convict this petitioner in a substantive sense as

Now under decisions of this court, as I stated at

8

the outset, a march made without a permit, contrary to a regu­

9

lation requiring a permit is constitutional and if is protected I

10

by the First Amendment if the permit ordinance or regulation is

11

unconstitutional on its face.

.

Now it is conceded that this ordinance is uncon-

12
13

stitutional in its face, and I have seen no argument serious or

14

otherwise to the contrary.
An alternative would be if the Staub doctrine and

IS
16

the Lovell doctrine were not the law of this court, that dis­

17

senters before they march would have to engage in expensive

18

litigation, as in let us

19

have to submit themselves to lengthy administrative proceedings

20

and there would be a chill upon free expression.
Petitioner in

21

say the Dombrowski case, or woiild

a case such as this would be in an

.

22

especially grave disadvantage in an administrative proceeding,

23

and in a judicial proceeding, because of the scope of review

24

on appeal in the Alabama courts is so circumscribed that in

25

dealing with a vague statute he would have great difficulty in

j

1

proving just what right of his had been denied..

But this

2

ordinance like the one in the Cox case was construed in the

3

Supreme Court of Alabama for the first time apparently to make

4

it constitutional^ and it was held below that Cox saved the

5

ordinance and saved the conviction.
Our position is, as I stated before, that even if

€

7

this were the case, it could not save the ordinance in the

8

sense that it could convict this petitioner.
We distinguish the Cox case on a variety of grounds.

0
to

First of all in Cox there was a statute which was essentially

11

blank as to standards, and it is conceivable that one might have

‘12

read tha {ordinance and said, well, what is it they mean and

13

reasonably might apply to traffic considerations, but here is

14

a statute which quite explicitly has other standards in it,

15

welfare, decency, and good order and so forth.
One need not be at a loss to guess what the State

16
17

means.

The State means these various vague general things about}

18

which one can't really predict whether one is entitled to

19

march or not.

20

i

I

Q

Did the Cox case of New Hampshire have any

standards whatever?
A

No, no, none.

No standards.

It is just that

you needed a permit.
Q

That was Chief Justice Hugh's opinion?

A

Yes, I think it was, yes.

It just said that you

9
I

I

needed a permit but it did not have any standards in it.

This

2

case on the contrary has a series of vague standards, and

3

while I would not agree with this, but it would be conceivable

4

to say that one might imagine that standards could foe imported
t

S

into a statute which is silent, I think it is asking a great

6

deal to expect a layman or indeed a lawyer to read out of the

7

statute a series of vague standards, and read into the

8

statute a series of traffic-type standards.

9

Secondly, as we pointed out in our brief, the Cox

10

case was in soma of the earlier days of First Amendment juris­

11

prudence in this court, and it may be that the court at this

12

time was not sufficiently alert to the chilling effect that

13

such a retroactive interpretation might have, and further that

14

the court had not really fully developed its jurisprudence

15

of First Amendment rights to apply to marches and parading and

16

picketing and things of that sort.

17

i

'
j

But in any event, even if the statute could be said

18

to be now made constitutional retrospectively by reading out

19

and reading in, we say that in a procedural sense it is not

20

constitutional in the sense of the

21

Interstate Circuit case, which says that when First Amendment

22

rights are denied they must be speedy, precise and efficacious

23

opportunity for review and none of that exists here at all.

It is not even as reconstructed, standards like that

Q

Now, do you know of any case where that doctrine

2

in obscenity cases has been applied to an ordinance, a valid

3

ordinance, as it relates to the control of the streets?

4i

A

Mo, Mr. Justice Harlan, but we would say that

5

a fortiori should apply, perhaps not necessarily to a case

6 j

involving use of the streets, but to a case involving what one

7

might call political rights, because I think it might be argued

8

that in the case involving a book or motion picture, for

9

example, while it is undesirable and it is unconstitutional

10 ;

to frustrate or de-slay the publication or the showing of the

11 |

motion picture, that something which involves a political

12 i

consdieration in which timeliness is exceedingly important and

13

the necessity for avoiding delay is crucial, as it was in this

14

case, the Good Friday March had a significance on Good Friday

15

and on Easter Sunday as such,

16 i

and effective review notion should apply to this kind of a

17

case, even more so than to a movie case.

2

the City of Columbia, which was one of the sit-in cases, dealt

3

with the trespass statute, and the court may recall that the

4

statute said that it was a misdemeanor to enter upon the lands

S

of another after notice from the owner prohibiting entry.
And the Petitioner in that case entered upon the

6

lands and he did not have notice prohibiting entry, and he was

While the case is not entirely precise, I think the

12

j

13

notion of retrospective interpretation to convict without fair j

14

notice is applicable in this case as well as in the Bouie case.j

15

I would like to address for a moment the question of i

16

fair procedure, which 1' say I think is crucial in this case

evidence concerning that.

23

as to why a permit is denied.

24

upon cross-examination of the witness Sarah Nowger who gave

25

out the permits, when permits are granted and when they are

So far as practice is concerned, there is no

tinguished from walking in the streets.

That line of ques­

tioning was cut off very soon after it began, so it was not
even possible to develop this at the trial.
There are no time limits, lengthy or brief.

There

is some suggestion about judicial review, but as the best we
can define from reading the Alabama law, the judicial review
would at least involve 30 days for answer in the trial court,
and there are no stated precise periods for appealing in the
.

Supreme Court of Alabama.
And the scope of review is extremely narrow.

It

would be by mandamus a certiorari, at which all one reviews is
the discretion of the grant or deny of the permit and in a
statute as vague as this, it would be very difficult to liti­
gate something of that sort.
So for all of these reasons we submit to the court
that the conviction of Petitioner Fred Shuttlesworth should not
be permitted to stand, that the statute as rewritten does not
save that conviction, that even if in a substantive sense and
as to future defendants that statute might be valid in a
procedural sense it is and remains unconstitutional.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

You may proceed, Mr. McBee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL McBEE

2

COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR. McBEE:

3

Mr. Justice Black and may it please the

4

Court, some 18 months ago, I believe, I had the privilege of

5

appearing before this court in reference to the case of Walker j

6
7

versus the City of Birmingham, in which we think is a closely
•
related case inasmuch as it deals with the identical parade

8

and, of course, deals with and involves the same parties.
That is the City of Birmingham, and in this instance

9
10

the respondent or rather the petitioner, F. L. Shuttlesworth.

11

We think the facts in that case should be considered in this

12

case, because they are related and even if the court has

13

authority to so consider we would like to call attention to

14

the fact that in the City of Birmingham, at the time this

15

particular litigation began, there had been a number of mass

16

parades and leading into the violence and had taxed the Police

17

Department of the City of Birmingham to protect the demon­

18

strators and also to protect the citizens of the City of

19

Birmingham.

.

On the evening of the 10th of April, the city acquire1!

20
121

an injunction from the State Court, enjoining the holding of

22

mass parades in violation of 1159; that is, the ordinance in

23

question.

24
25

i

The reaction to that injunction was an immediate
denial of any right of a state or any intent of the parties

14

1

involving the petitioner to pay any attention to the injunction

2

but as a matte?, of fact they said that the injunction was not

3

to be respected and not to be obeyed but that they did not

4

believe in obeying laws that they considered to be opposed

5

to their way of life*

6

Q

Mr. McBee, there is no issue about any injunc--

7

tion in this case.

that he had been mistreated and mislead into the arrest on

14

are at least to some extent relevant.

15

And we believe that the facts in the Walker case

Q

I don't see how any issue of an injunction is

16

in this case, and I didn't understand it to be, after having

17

carefully read your brief.

18

A

Well, we agree that it is not an issue in the

19

case, but we believe or we thought at least that the factual

20

situation was relevant.

21

22

Q

Well, this is a conviction for holding a parade

without a permit.

23

A

Yes, sir, that is true.

£4

Q

And it has nothing to do or there are no issues

25

here of disorderly conduct or violence or defiance of a court

i

<*fi

order»

2

None of those things are in this case.
A

I believe that is correct, that there is no

3

question of any misconduct on the part of these particular

4

defendants in the sense of any disorderly conduct»

5

wasn't in that case either, but they did say that they were

going to disobey a court order,

8

Q

And it

case at all.

8

A

In the facts in the case, in this particular

10

instance, there is no question but that the evidence clearly

If

shows the violation of the law.

12

Now, the question of the precedents that were before

13

the court and which the court must consider as we believe in

14

determining the rightfulness or wrongfulness of the conviction

15

in this case will be, among other things, of course, the Cox

16

case.

17

That is the New

Hampshire Cox case.

Now the New Hampshire Cox case did not place any sort

18

of restrictions upon the issuance of the license.

19

was particularly and fully and completely based upon the

20

monetary consideration, plus whatever restrictions the deciding

21

body might want to put into it.

22

The license

For example, they could if they wanted to, use racial

23

lines for denying the applications, and they could use religiou 3

24

lines to deny the application, and they could also presumably

25

use any other criteria for denying the application.
16

I

In considering the question, and we don’t believe

2

that the ordinance in 1159 is any more void or invalid than

3

is the ordinance in the case of Cox because of the fact that

4

there was reference to some action on the part of the court

5

in connection with the city commission with the various aspects;

€>

of the police power of the city.

7

In other words, it does relate to specifically the

8

aspects of the police power.

9

Alabama in its ruling which by the way followed the ruling of

Now, the Supreme Court of

10

this court in the case of Walker versus the City of Birmingham,

11

the City of Birmingham versus Walker, did hold in line with

12

that case that the ordinance was not unconstitutional.

1.3

Now, there has been a question raised as to why the

14

Court of Alabama waited so long.

15

that they were waiting until this court made its decision in

15

the Walker case.

17

I have a strong suspicion

The court in this case, in the Walker case, was

18

dealing with a particular ordinance in question, and, of course

19

was certainly expected and anticipated there would be some

20

guidelines for the court to follow1.

21

I think that there is some misapprehension at least

22

in the argument of the petitioner in this case as to the sig­

23

nificance of the two lines of cases.

24
25

Now we certainly respect and know that there are
some permissible regulations that can be used in connection
17

with parades and other types of actions upon the streets.
But on the other hand, there is also in the connection with
v

the regular pure speech cases a less privilege on the part
of local governing bodies to present and to enforce regulations
which restrict or do impair the right of the demonstrators
or the people using free speech.
In the Cox case the court made it clear that there
is a difference in use of public streets and in pure speech,
if a municipality has authority to control the streets for
parades or processions, it cannot be denied to give con­
sideration to the time and place and manner as to the proper
use of the streets, we find it .impossible to say the limited
authority conveyed by the statute in question as thus con­
strued by the State court as contravening any constitutional
right.
It must be borne in mind that this statute was con­
strued just as in our case, in a conviction situation in­
volving Cox, and it was construed post the act for which he
was convicted.

a.

That is after the act for which he was convicte

The conviction was upheld and we think in line with
other decision of this Honorable Court for the reason that when
he violated the ordinance he did so with the fact that it was
conceivable that a valid construction could be placed upon the
ordinance which would render it constitutional, and he then did
at his peril violate the particular constitution of that
18
\

f

that interstate ordinance as it should be made valid by the

2

construction of the court»
We come on to the Walker case and, of course, I think

3
4

Mr. Greenberg refers to the fact that Lovell and Staub and

5

Freedman, the doctrine of those cases are at odds with the

6

holding of the court, in Alabama court in this case.
But, however, in the Walker case, we find the

7
8

reference to Cox versus Louisiana, in which the court said

9

that we emphatically reject the notion that the First and

10

Fourteenth Amendments afford the same kind of freedom, of

11

those who communicate ideas by conduct,

12

marching or picketing on streets and highways, as these

1.3

amendments afford to those who communicate ideas by pure

14

speech.

such as patroling,

At another point in the Walker case, the court said,

15
16

there ought to be a body on this to impose regulations in order

17

to assure safety for these people in the use of public high­

!8

ways has never been regarded as inconsistent with civil
.

19

liberties, but rather is one of the means of safeguarding good

20

order.

21

Then in going on over to the question of this par­

22

ticular ordinance, the generality of the language contained

23

in the Birmingham ordinance on which the injunction was based,

24

will unquestionably raise substantial constitutional issues

23

concerning some of its provisions.
19

1

There is the citation of a number of cases.

The

2

petitioners, however, did not even attempt to apply to the

3

Alabama courts for an authoritative construction of the orders/

4

and this we think is %7ery significant.

5

Had they done so, those courts might have given the

S

licensing authority granted in the ordinance a narrow and

7

precise scope, as the New Hampshire Courts in Cox versus the

8

State of New Hampshire and Poulos versus the State of New

9

Hampshire.

10

Here, just as in Cox and Poulos it could not be

1?

assumed that this ordinance was void on its face.

12

going into the question of the application of the ordinance,

13

the petitioners also claim they were afraid to question the

14

ordinance.

15

And then

These precedents, and that is to say the other cases,

16

clearly put the petitioners on notice that they could not

17

bypass orderly judicial review and claimed that they were

10

trapped or mislead is entirely unfounded.

19

20

Now, may it please the court we think that the
significance of that is this:

That the precedent of Cox versus
'

21

New Hampshire and also Poulos versus New Hampshire -was avail­

22

able to the petitioner of this case at the time that he

23

violated the injunction, and violated the ordinance of 1159.

24
25

Also the Kansas case would be something he should
be informed of or should have known about, so these decisions
20

1

should be known to him and he could not claim entrapment

2

because he should have known about them, and also the evidence

3

showed that they did it with expectation of going to jail»

4
5

So far as Cox versus New Hampshire is concerned, we
find that that case and also Poulos versus the State of New
■

6

Hampshire, has been accepted by the courts with a steady and

7

an unbroken line and I suppose have been cited maybe at least

8

50 or 100 times, as sound decisions.

9

Coming on down through, of course, in 1965, the Cox

10

versus Louisiana, and by the way the decision in the Walker

11

Case in .1967, and then the most recent case is Amalgamated

12

Food Employees Union versus Logan Valley Plaza, and in that

13

case Mr. Justice Marshall, writing for the coux't and 1 believe

14

there was one concurring opinion and one dissent, said in

15

addition the exercise of First Amendment rights may be regu­

16

lated where such exercise will unduly interfere with normal

17

use of public property by other members of the public, with

ts

equal right of access to it.

19

Thus it has been held that persons desiring to

20

parade along city streets may be required to secure a permit

21

in order that the municipal authorities may be able to limit

22

noninterference with the use of the sidewalks by other members

23

of the public by regulating the time, place and manner of the

24

parade.

25

Now, of course, as the Supreme Court of Alabama has
21

1

construed the 1159 ordinance, it can only be applied in

2

reference to actually the good order and the convenience and

3

use of the streets.
The essential contention as we understand it is being

4
5

made at this time that the ordinance did not give fair notice.

G

As a matter of fact, Bouie has been referred to, and I believe

7

Lanzetta.

s

The Bouie case involves a situation where the facts

9

showed an intent to apply an ordinance to a factual situation

tO

that it wasn’t on its face designed to accommodate.

11

instance, the ordinance was designed to prevent or rather to

12

punish going upon property when you were warned not to go on it.

13

For

It was applied to a situation where the parties

14

were already on it without the notice being put up and they

15

were warned to get off.

16

one that the ordinance on its face showed as a possibility of,

17

and therefore the courts held that it was not fair notice,

1G

Lanzetta was a situation where anybody who was a

Of course, that construction was not

19

member of a gang, a gang consisting of two or more persons,

20

which, of course, is too broad and no one could really describe

22

what a gang was really, know what a gang was within the

22

meaning of the statute.

23

Now, in reference to the question of fair notice

24

and the administrative procedures, here again the court in

25

Poulos versus New Hampshire had occasion to deal with that
22

1

2

particular and specific problem.
In that case the ordinance or rather statute, which-

3

ever one it was, had bean construed by the Supreme Court of

4

New Hampshire and had been approved by this court, in the

5

opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes — the court in the

6

Poulos case said that the application had been made for a

7

permit but wrongfully the licensing authorities had refused

8

to grant the permit, and because they had refused to grant the

9

permit the defendant had proceeded to violate it.

10

In other words, he proceeded to go ahead and have

11

his speech or whatever he was going to have without the benefit

12

of the permit.

1.3

you have put him in that situation of going into a mandamus:

14

proceeding, would be expensive, would be difficult for him to

15

accomplish, and would delay

IS

freedom of speech and so forth.

17

A great question was raised in this court that

him in his exercise of his

The court rejected that argument, that is, the New

18

Hampshire Court rejected the argument and said that that would

19

not be permissible because he had a remedy, and he could have

20

gone into the courts and enforced his right to 3peak.

2!

This court, considering that question, said that that

22

is exactly correct, that he could have gone in to court,, and

23
24

he could have presented his wrongful disallowance of the
.
permit, and not having followed that procedure which the State

2,5

courts permitted he, therefore, was not entitled to the

.

23

j

i

1

protection of the constitutional amendment that he was

2

relying on.

3

Q

Mr. Me Bee, suppose a convention in your* city

4

in one of the convention halls adjourned and this many people

5

walked in exactly the same manner as these people did in this

6

case back to their hotel.

7

Would they be violating the ordinance?

8

A

No, sir, they would not.

3

Q

What is the thing then in this case that makes

10

j

this a violation of the law?

11

A

The ordinance as construed.

12

Q

No, what is the thing that these people did that!

13

makes them liable to the ordinance, where they wouldn't be

14

liable under the circumstances that I just suggested to you?
A

15

Well, I was trying to answer that question in

16

saying this, that there was —- the ordinance does, as con­

17

strued, refers to formal actual procesion-type of walks.

10

had the same issue in the Cox-New Hampshire case, where I

19

think in that case there were 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 groups, of some

They

j

.

20

10 or 15 walking in single file, peaceably, and there was no

21

question about that, and nobody raised that question, but they

22

did walk in single file, and the issue raised was, whether or

£3

not that amounted to a parade within the meaning of the

24

authorities.

■

|

25

And, of course, that was that they held that to be
24

1

a violation of the New Hampshire statute or ordinance.

2

in this case, of course the court said again there roust be

3

a formal parade, and, of course, the reason why we think that

4

a permit is required for a demonstration or a parade of this

5

type is simply this:

6

required by lax?, by this court, to provide safe-guarding

7

procedures and police protection to take care of possible

Now,
1

That the city or local governing body is

.

8

disorders that might interfere with their right to parade.

9

And, of course, in this instance, if they had no

{

10

permit requirement they would not know where the parade was

11

to be or when it was to be or what route it was to take and

12

would have no information as to what to do in providing

13

the protection.
Q

14

Wouldn’t the same thing occur when they broke

15
16

walked along the sidewalk in exactly the same manner?
A

17

I don't know of any likelihood of anybody

18

committing disorder in a crowd walking from one event to

19

another event.
Q

20
21

I never have heard of that.
I understood you to say that there was no dis

order in this case?
A

22

Well, actually, I don't believe that — of

23

course, the question of the participation of the body of so-

24

called on-lookers; that is the question really I think is

25

disputed.
25

1

Q

The so-called what?
I

2

A

The so-called on-lookers.

They had recruited

kJ

these people to come and they had asserobled them in the

4

vicinity of the church, and while only about 52 came out of

5

the church in the formal inarch, wearing blue-jeans, I believe,

6

the numbers of the on-lookers which came along took up around,

7

I think, maybe 1,000 or 1500, and they took up the streets and

8

also both sidewalks.

9

They were blocking both sidewalks.

They were completely utilizing and completely en
i

10

masse moving along and pre-empting the use of both sidewalks.

11

G

Were they arrested?

12

A

13

not very many of them.

14

Q

15

peacefully?

16

A

17

wanted to be arrested.

10

Q

19

A

,

Some of them were, but they couldn't catch them,

But they did take all of these who xvere going

Yes, your Honor, but those that went peacefully
That was a part of the procedure.

It has to be?
Yes, sir, they had recruited people to be

20

arrested and go to jail.

That is what they came there for^

21

They had intended to do that.

22

I suppose, money-raising was one of the reasons that they did

23

it.

Now they had purposes in mind,

Of course, we can't be certain about it.
;

24
25

But I would assume that that was for other reasons
of their own.

But they did recruit people to come and to
26

1

2
3
4

march and to be arrested.
Q

And they were arrested.

When the case was tried, did they deny that

they intended to parade?
A

1 think the only case we have tried, that is to

5

say now at the Recorder’s trial, they didn’t take the stand

6

at all, as I recall.

7

Q

But it went up to the Circuit Court, didn’t it?

8

A

Well, now, the only thing is, may it please the

9
10

court, in this case, Mr. Justice Black, this is the only case
that has been tried so far as I know, of these cases.

11

Q

Well, did it go to the Circuit Court?

12

A

Yes, it went to the Circuit Court.

13

Q

It was tried before a jury?

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

Did they defend on

16
17

the ground that they

had not

paraded or on the ground that the law was unconstitutional?
A

Well, their main objection was, and so far as

18

I know, as I recall, there was no serious objection, no serious

19

denial of the fact that they paraded.

20

was clear that they did.

21

Q

Without a permit?

22

A

Yes, without a permit.

23
24
25

Certainly the evidence

Theymade nocontention

that they ever had a permit.
Q

Well, except, Mr, McBee, they must have raised

it, because in the Court of Appeals, Judge Gait’s opinion, and
27

1
2

I an reading now from the very last paragraph of his very
.

lengthy opinion, appearing on page 143 of the record here, it

3

says that the city failed to make a case under the purported

4

meaning of Section 1159 of there being a need for the appellant
in this case to be covered by a permit to use the sidewalk in

G
7
8

company with others.
That is a clear holding as I read it and you tell me
if I am nistaken, that the ordinance at issue here simply was
not applicable to the conduct of these petitioners»

And then

iO

I understand, of course, that the Supreme Court of Alabama

n

disagreed with that, but if there is that much room for dis­
agreement, as it appears that there was here between the Court
of Appeals and the Supreme Court, don’t the petitioners have
a very valid and fair notice argument as to the very meaning

15
16

and coverage of this ordinance?
A

Well, as a matter of fact, they also had notice,

17

I think there was some statement made at some point along the

10

line that perhaps because they were on the sidewalk as opposed
to being in the middle of the street, that they possibly were

20
21

not violating the ordinance.
However, though, there was in the city code a section

22

which defined the meaning of street to include sidewalks and

23

had been in all of these years.

24

Judge Gaits either did not know that or hadn't made any effort

25

to find out, because it was actually in the law of the city.

So that, Mr. Justice Stewart,

28

Q

I don't understand him to be necessarily making

a distinction between the paved part of the street and the

•m/

sidewalk part of the public way, but rather just to use the

streets in company with others,

I gathered, perhaps again I am wrong, that his

language could simply be construed that 52 people, which he

13

that the Supreme Court subsequently disagreed, but as I say,

14

if there is that much doubt about it, don't the petitioners

15

have a very colorful argument with respect to the notice that

16

the ordinance gave them?
A

17

Of course, it is clear

opinion, didn’t it, at least referred to it in a footnote?

Well, I think it mentioned the case and it

3

said, of course, it could perhaps be construed to be

unconstitutional.

Q

He pointed out that it had been held to be?

Well, yes, I think it mentioned that.

provide against overlapping parades, and there would be no
