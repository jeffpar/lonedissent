ON BEHALF OE' PETITIONER

MR. DAHZIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and lllBY it please the

10

court, the defendant Butenko is a co-defendant in the prior

11

case of Ivanov, argument on which the court has just heard,

12

I went to mention at t-.he outset that there are three

13

other conspirators who "ere che.rged in the conspiracy, but who

14

were unindicted by reascn of diplomatic immunity.

15

pr&senee may have some ~elationship tothe problem of standing

16

when it gets up into the argu111£nt.

17

Their

Now, when the Court pz·ojects the issues in this

ta

case the issues were prcjected on the asswnption that there had

19

been an electronic eurVE:illance in violation of the Pourth

Amendment.

13

I accept that statement of the Government as an

absolute verity, and accepting it aa an absolute verity, let

22

court, being a diligent Federal judge, will sit down and make

a mechanical comparison of what. the record it has received in

as I have assumed, the absolute truth of the Government's

2

statement in its brief that an examination of these records in

3

camera will convince any judge that they are in no way

arguably relevant to the conviction.

5

that position or sanction it in any manner whatsoever, that is

6

the encl of the case,

Alderman and Kolod and a lot of other pecple who are in

12

just fall by the wayside on the basis of these assumptions.

13

The court will never mach those questions.

This is

14

exactly the position the Government has taken on the point of

15

national security at about Page 8 or 9 in this brief here in

a revelation of what we have gathered.

20

nothing in these records which in any way affects the prosecu-

21

tion.

22

They say, please do not put us to the option of makin

So we have no problem with national security, no

23

problem of injury to third persons.

It has been said that that tum-over

On that basis it would seem to

11

violated by the Govermrent going in with a mass of material,

13

defendant himself?

14

Then wo look at the protection of the Sixth Amendment

Now, when we take a look at the kind of records we

21

have that they want to submit to a court, that, too, should

give us pause.

of records they have in this case.

until this court determines how, if at all, they are to be

shown.

I have not seen nor has anybody seen the kind

But we do have some information on that and consider

information is incorporati,d in Mr. Williams' br.ief in

2

Alderman and some of it a·:pears in his brief in Ivanov.

3

What do we have t:here?

We

find a rather shocking

4

situation.

5

records have been produced in the first instance.

6

they produce records they come along at soma later time and say

7

"We didn't know about this batch that turned up in soma drawer

8

or corner.•

9

We find a seri~us question of whether all the

Wnen the records

Every time

are produced we find that there is

10

information in there that is comingled with other information

It

so as to conceal the source.

12

conceal whether or not the source of the information came from

13

live investigator, from an electronic bug or even a wire tap.

Euphelllisms and syrnbols are used t

14

There are cases 11her.e there are no records at all, as

t5

in the case Mr. Williams Qdverted to where the agent heard the

t6

telephone, played back the tapes, heard the conversation,

t7

called agents all over the country and started a chain of

ta

investigations on peopls.

He has nothing.

19

Now, when we see the nature of the records and we can

20

only go by what we have seen in the past and what is now known

21

and has appeared time and time before this court, when we see

22

what kind of records they want to submit to a court in camera,

23

we say that we are not having our Constitutional rights

24

protected.

25

violative of those rights and the only way we can find out

We are advocatinl?' a cource of conduct that is

-6-

1

whether there is any integrity to the record or whether or not

2

there is some illegality that has been concealed is by having

3

a full-fledged adversary hea~ing at which extrinsic evidence

4

must be produced so tha.t the c.efendant ca.n be confronted with

5

a live witness and not a record, the genuineness of which can

6

be questioned.

7

If we start with that no court of justice in the pur-

8

suit of justice can tolerate a. course such as is now being

9

seriously advanced by a Goverrment.

10

Q

What does that mean in practice?

Does that mean

11

that you would be entitled to subpoena the agents who over-

12

heard the conversation?

13

to make sure that the records were complete.

You ~ould be entitled to subpoena them

14

A

Yes.

15

Q

Would you be entitled to subpoena the agents who

16

investigated the case generally to see whether they utilized

17

any of that information?

to

A

I should think &o, Your Honor.

1D

Q

Then would you be entitled to subpoena the lawyer

20

who put the case together for the utilization of the Grand

21

Jury to see if they utilized

22

A

that information?

That has been done in one case and I would say

23

yes, at least to see how much of the evidence, which on our

24

assumption has been illegally obtained, because if we are,going

25

to extirpate this evil, and an evil it is, and the extent of
-7-

t

z

of the evil has been mentioned quite clearly by decisions of
this court such as in Katz end Burger and other decisions that

3

don't come to mind, the Government must bear the burden of purg

4

ing itself and the defense sho·.ild have the right to call these

5

agents as though they are hostlle and court's witnesses and

6

cross-examin! them as h1ppened in Way, where we have a Jencks

7

statute.

8
9

Q

You are making n, distinction between national

security cases and other cases?

to

A

Your Honor, it s,?ems to me that the national

11

security problem has been resolved by the decision of this

12

,~

court in Jencks and Roviaro where this bogeyman has beon

14

or isn't.

raised and nobody knows where it is really national security

If we could agree on a definition here -- I don't

15

16

know whether or not there are facts which would get this

17

particular case into that definition.

18

Q

Espionage on behalf of a foreign power, as is

19

alleged to be the case hero, 13 kind of close to national

20

security.

21

A

It io a very seductive situation and very easy to

22

accept as national security, but the content of the crime, that

23

is, what actually did happen here or what they could have gotte.

24

through this -- I don't want to call him menial, because he

25

has a very high title like assistantdrector, but I am talking

-8-

1

about Butenko, but the papers he has access to, and I know

2

nothing about the trial, I have only read part of the record,

3

indicates that he did not have access to anything of any great

4

importance, bit that is not the fact of the matter here.

5

important part is that they have, I think, merely invoked the

6

spector of national security to gain their main objective, and

7

that is to have an in cmnera hearing.

0
9

Q

The

The reason I was asicing these questions is, what

is going on in rny mind is this:

If you take the sweep of

what

10

Mr. Williams is talking about and what you are talking about as

11

I understand it , national security cases don't mean that wherev r

12

there has been nny electronic espionage over a vast area that

13

may have some relationship to the defendant that in that vast

14

area the GoV0rnnent is :r:eally faced with dismissing the case

15

if there has been any electronic espionage or electronic

1G

surveillance in this vast area that we were discussing with

17

Mr. Williams.

18

A

I think that would be a fair position to put the

19

Government into since it, itself, has created the predicament

20

it finds itself in.

21

a simple matter.

22

prior to that there have been occasions where the Government

23

in authority wanted to have information and they authorize an

He also testified that he reinstituted surveil-

lance about an hour later and picked up Mr. Butenko 's car about
twenty miles nor.th from ths point where he terminated his
surveillance in front of a restaurant in North Jersey.

think they are that good that they could follow an automobile

To

physical surveillance and not through the bug leaves an
impression on a jury's ,nind which is not quite consistent with
the fact.
It makes me qu2stion ~hether or not evidence of that
nature is reliable and ~hether all these physical surveillances
were not a way of conoeali.ng the real source of the infor-.r,ation,
namely, the bug.
I want to repeat a qu~stion that Mr. Justice Brennen
put in his concurring opinion in Palermo, whether or not the
interpretation placed on that statute, the Jencks Act, would
not encourage agents to prepare their reports in such fashion
so they would be insulated fro~ production and Icpestion whethe
or not these physical surveillances and this omission of
information about the real source of the clues and the rendezvo
and whatever else was used in the conviction of this evidence,
I question whether or not thess records may not, in view of the
absolute faith

the Government has in submitting these records

in camera, that it wlll disclose nothing relevant, I question as
Mr. Justice Brennen did whether or not these records contain

anything about elect~nic information.
And, absent an adversary hearing, we will never know
and illegality will be the rule rather than the exception
-12-

1
2

On our position in standing, I think that has been
made clear in the brief.

3
4

Q

I don't have any more time.

I gather your position goes beyond the one stated

by Mr. Williams.
A

5

Yes, Your Honor.

I go all the way.

I don't go

I am drawn there as a result of what this court has

6

there.

7

said about the dcterance theory of the exclusionary rule and al

8

the other aspect of it.

9

Q

Juut simply stated, it is logical if the exclu-

to

sionary rule is designed to deter illegal action by Government

11

inforcement authorities,then no matter how they get it and no

12

matter who is hurt, they should not be able to use it.

13

A

Yes, and I add to that that in fact if that

14

rule is not adopted it is putting the stamp of approval on the

15

use of evidence that has been illegally obtained.

16
17
18
19

20
21
22

23
24

25

Q

Again, that is not the issue because I take it

that the Government is not contending for the right to use
evidence obtained by electronic surveillance.

The question is,

what should be the mechanism for determining whether the
recorded or logged information obtained by electronic surveillance is arguably relevant to the prosecution or the defense
in this particular case.
A

mechanism?
Q

Would you agree with that?

I think that is the issue.

What is the

What procedure will we use?
Nobody is arguing here in this case or in any
-13-

t

cases that even in national defense matters unlawfully

2

obtained information,

3

unlawful electronic surveillance should be admissible in

4

evidence.

5

in a later case where it ia a national security case, but he is

6

not arguing it now.

7

A

:i.nformat:ion obtained as a result of

The Solicitor General says he may want to argue that

I agree ti,at that is the issue, but I say that

8

the procedure which the Governi1ent suggests is one that

9

violates Constitutional guarant~es.

The only

way the

10

defendant's rights, as announced time and time again by this

11

court in similar situations or in a different context has been

12

that you must have an adversary hearing.

13

14

15

I say if we buy this position of an in camera
inspectlon that is tile end of this case.
Q

Do you understand that the r.overrunent raises the

16

stcnding question in either caue or is asking that any standing

17

question be litigated?

18

A

I don't think it has

COll\3

forth with that, but

19

standing has been a projection of this court in its limited

20

writ of certiorari.

21

Q

22

23

I was just wondering whether you understand that

the Government was raising it.
A

There is no need for them

1:o

raise it for the

24

simple reason that if they get an in camera inspection we will

25

have nothing.

we

don't reach the question of standing just as

we don't reach the question of national security and we don't
reach the question of whether the disclosure of these records

3

or an adversary hearing involving cross-examination of agents

4

will injum third persons.

5

way of closing the door and not opening Pandora's box.

6

Q

We don't get to that.

It is a nice

You are not

10

like that or the trial judge is going to be as inept as that,

as you would assume, do you?

No, I don't assume that at all, but I do assume

13

that the Government told the truth when he said a submission

14

of these records to a trial judge will

20

Q

that turns out to be a fact after a full-

matter?

12

Q

Is it true that the only reason we know that there

13

was electronic surveillance in this case is because of the

14

voluntary disclosure of the fact by the Government after the

15

trial?

16

A

I think that is so, Your Honor.

17

Q

And that \las done informally with what has been

18
19

described as a current Government policy: is that right?
A

I think that is so.

Current Government policy is,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

15

court, I would not have supposed that it would be suggested tha

16

this was not a case involving the national security.

17

is that Butenko, as an American citizen, was elli>loyed by the

18

International Electronic Corporation which was under contract

19

with the Air Force to produce a command and control system for

20

the Strategic Air Command.

21

and computer programming equipment designed to store and trans-

22

mit operational equipment such as the location of aircraft and

23

distances from targets which will enable the Commander of the

24

strategic Air Command to alert and execute all his forces at

25

an extremely rapid rate and provide him with up-to-the-minute

The fact

crime and things of that sort . As we have used it in these

11

cases it relates solely to relations with foreign nations and

12

to efforts to guard against espionage and to protect military

13

and national secrets of the United States.

14

I would emphasize again that we are not in this case

15

seeking to argue that the evidence is admissible, althought I

16

can conceive of cases, as for example, if the information is

17

obtained there is a ship on the high seas which contains a

1a

nuclear device which,when the ship gets to New York Harbor, is

19

going to be exploded, and by virtue of very effective and

20

determined detective skills it is not only found where the

21

ship is, but it is also found that it was being brought here

22

by a group of Americans who were seekirqto take over the Govern-

23

ment at so:me point, it seems to me there ought to be freedom to

24

argue that whatever method was used to obtain evidence with

But if it is done by officers of the United State

I would find it difficult to argue that the Fourth Amendment,

whatever it means, is not applicable to the officers of the

United States.

What if something happens in Iran or Italy or

Japan, isn't that covered by the Fourth Amendment?

12

A

I suppose that a courts martial trial in Germany

13

is covered by the Fifth Amendment and a courts martial trial of

14

a United States military person, if it is an effort to exercise

15

the forceful power of the United States that power is limited b

1G

the Fifth Amendment and by the Fourth Amendment, I would

17

assume.

18

At any rate, we don't have that involved here.

explosion occurred.

comprehensive in that task.

14

Q

Does your argument lead to the conclusion that

15

an unreasonable search, one of the circumstances to be determin d

16

is the enormity of the crime?

17

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, I would think that that is a

1a

way of putting it.

The only crime ~.hat is enormous enough, it

seems to me, would be massive treason, massive, the destruction

future with respect to the case the awful facts of which I

2

cannot now imagine, the right to contend that very vigorous

protecting the country are not the same as those to protect

obtained by these methods or any evidence which was

8

produced from a lead ob·tained from these methods is admissible

9

in this case.

We are not making any

We are not saying that any evidence here is

10

We are arguing here simply that in a situation where

11

it is perfectly plain that the electronic surveillance had no

12

relation whatever to the evidence produced at the trial, that

13

we should be free to establish that fact before the United

14

States district judge

15

merely to the defendant, but as is inevitable in cases of

16

this sort, to the other nation which may be involved.

17

Q

~ithout its being disclosed, not

Aren't there two things we have to consider here?

18

One is the question of the violation, alleged violation of the

19

individual rights of a person who is on trial for his life or

20

liberty and secondly, the power of dete r ance from doing

21

illegal things by the Government?

22

We have read in the past -- everyone has, I think,

23

that the Government from time to time has disavowed any wire-

24

tapping or any bugging, except, as has been said, in a very,

25

very few national security cases.

-21-

I think the figure has been

1

t1

as low as 20 or JO in the country at a particular time.

Now,

we find out that after this new policy of the Government has be n
announced that they have been bugging in all fields. We find
in the Katz case, in a small gambling case that ends up in a
fine of $200 that the Government bugged this place for over a
month, night and day, and we find that apparently there were a
great many Internal Revenue cases where they have bugged the
person just on incon.a tax violations.

Still the Government

asserts it was only done in national security cases .
Don't we have to fashion a rule that will prevent the
Goverrunont fron doing that very thing?

If there is a way of

t2

permitting wire-tapping or other bugging in national security

13

cases, shouldn't there be a law designed to accomplish that

14

purpose and hasn't the Congress designed such a law?

15

doesn't affect these cases, but I would assume that if we have

16

a proper deterant so far as illegal wire-tapping is concerned,

17

that the Government will thereafter follow the law as long as

18

it is sustained.

It

19

What the effect of that law is, we don't know, whether

w

it is Constitutional or not, we don't know, but should we not i

21

the future require the Government in all cases, whether it is

22

national security or not, to abide by the law that Congress

23

makes, and if the Congress has said it is illegal under the
communications Act to do what has been done, shouldn't we

abide by that?

we have felt that

whenever the name appears that we must make disclosure to the
Court as we have, but we do feel that the defendant can be
adequately protected if the details are disclosed to the
district judge and he can determine that nothing happens that
is

relevant to the prosecti~n.
Q

As I understand you are basing your distinction

between national security and cases that do not involve the
national security on the rule

fashioned by Congress that is

the interpretation of the Constitution itself.

No, Mr. Justice, I don't understand that the

recent act of Congress eontrols these cases.

Q

The question of standing in the Butenko and Ivanov

cases, have you looked up these records?

10

A

No, I think not, but I think it is on disclosure

by the district judge himself.

12
