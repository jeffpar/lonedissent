ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LACOVARA;

7

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court.
I would like to resume this morning by restating

10

briefly the Government9 s basic position, in the Internal Revenue

11

Forfeiture Case and it is that unlike Marchetti and Grosso

12

which involved punishment for refusing to come forward to

13
14

15
16
17

18

19
20
21
22
23

disclose information that would have been incriminatory.
Internal Revenue forfeitures of the type involved in
this case do not involve any punishment for anyone’s invocation
privilege against self-incrimination.
Rather, we submit, unlike the common-law type of
forfeiture which attached in personam upon the criminal con­
viction of a felony.

Internal Revenue forfeitures historically

and legally are quite different, critically different we think,
for these purposes in that liability or guilt if you choose to
use that term attaches directly to the property and not to any
person and the forfeiture is not punishment directed at anyone
but is simply a remedial device for safeguarding the public fiskj.

24
q

Of course, if the property belongs to somebody

A

That is right.

a

The forfeiture statutes like the one in question

9
10

I!
12

declare that property rights shall not exist in property in
physical items any longer after certain conditions are met so
there is undoubtedly an item that was at one point someoneSs
property which no longer is his.

Q

The same rule that you are contending for would

have applied whether it had been 5 cents or a million dollars.
A
Q

That is right.
It has no relationship at all to any tax lia­

bility he might have had?
A

That is correct.

We think that indicates ——

Q

You mean the amount?

A

Pardon me?
10

1

Q

You mean the amount that has no relationship?

2

A

Yesg the amount of the forfeiture* the value of

3

the forfeiture is unrelated to the amount of tax liability that

4

the individual has but

5

that the items which were the property of an individual are

6

not necessarily owned by the person who has the tax liability.
And that is the essence of our position in arguing

7
8

think it is important to point out

that Internal Revenue forfeitures are not penal.
Q

9

May

ask you one question?

Suppose the Congress had used the words* actual words*

10
11

"This shall be considered, as a punishment and the Government

12

shall be allowed to get it as a punishment."

13

cover it?

Would Marchetti

I think we would have a much more difficult case*

A

your Honor.

Q

Do you think there would be any doubt about it?

Boyd X think would then* would probably b®

And X think Boyd ——

controlling in that situation.

We think of Boyd as explained

by this Court in the case in which we principally rely*
Helvering against Mitchell* 303 U.S.
Q

Justice
Brandeis!?
\)

A

Justice Brandeis' opinion over the sole of the

Senate to Justice McReynolds.
Justice Brandeis explained that Boyd was careful to
distinguish the penal and remedial forfeitures and* of course*
11

1

Justice Bradley8s opinion does make that careful distinction
«

2

and determines that the forfeiture in that case was one that

3

was penal in the common-law sense in that, it attached because

4

of the particular individuals criminal liability and Justice

3

Bradley said that the Government in that case could have pro­

6

ceeded directly against the owner of the property for committing

7

a crime and included in the judgment of criminal conviction

3

could have been a decree forfeiting property.
That was the common-law method of forfeiting property»

9
10

Justice Bradley carefully distinguished, however, the statutory

11

forfeitures which are unconcerned with anyone's criminal con­

12

viction or even with anyone's amenability to criminal prose­

Q

What are the remedial forfeitures for?

You say

they are remedial»
A

There are two purposes»

Q

What are they for?

A

Two purposes 1 would say»

One is to remove from

circulation the physical means, the wherewithal by which an
activity has been carried in violation of the internal Revenue
laws so that tax liability has not been paid»
This prevents a repetition of the same offense»
is easiest to visualise in the case of a truck —

;: -

■Q

Was that the violation?

A

Conducting a wagering business on which the
12

It

'I

occupational and excise taxes have not been paid»
Q

2

3

So it is a failure to pay the tax, you say is

the legal violation* not the failing to register?
h

4

That is correct.
The cases and the statute focus on the use of

5

6

the property in a way that is inconsistent where in violation

7

of the Revenue laws.
q

8
9

It is carrying on an untaxed business.

well* this will make it even less likely that he

can pay the tax or that you can collect the tax?

10

A

l am sorry, I don't see that.

1?

Q

Well* if he takes all his money away from him

12

that he has earned gambling, how can he pay his tax if you say

1.3

he hasn't paid?
A

14
15

draw before.

Well, this was the distinction I was trying to
Money is not necessarily his.

The money is owned

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Yes, but it is sometimes.

A

It sometimes is.

Q

Well* it is here.

A

In the event the individual has no more funds

than are actually seized from him because they have been used
in violation of tax.

I don't think that the public revenues

are in any way harmed because by definition in that situation
the Government could not have obtained any greater tax revenue
at all.

*'s13

1

Q

But you don’t credit his talc liability?

2

A

Ho, for the simple reason the seizure is unre­

3

lated to his tax law»

4

0

So what is the second purpose?

5

A

The second purpose„ again explained iri the

6

Helvering against Mitchell is that this type of forfeiture makes

7

the Government whole for the cost of investigating a tax

8

default and it reimburses for the additional amount of time

S

and effort that it takes to investigate a tax liability which

10
11
12

13

has not been satisfied by voluntary-- •
Q

You wouldn't say the remedial type of forfeiture

is ever aimed at encouraging people to pay their taxes?
A

Oh» I won’t say it has no role or no effect in

14

encouraging people to pay their taxes, but it is not primarily

15

designed for that purpose and historically its focus is not

16

upon the individual who has failed to pay the taxes.

17

Q

Well, assuming that it was, let us suppose

18

Congress said it was perfectly clear that Congress intended

19

the forfeiture provisions to deter people from not paying or

20

to encourage them to pay.

2!

you are now?

22

A

Would you be in any worse shape than

Oh, 1 think I would have to concede I would be

23

in slightly worse shape but I think I would be prepared to

24

defend that.

25

Because as I was saying yesterday the lynch pin

of our argument is the continuing validity of the wagering
14

j

1

2

tax.
Q

You concede that Marchetti, where some pressure

3

is utilized to force the person to come forward and pay his

4

gambling tax?

5

h

No, 1 won’t concede that.

6

Q

Why?

7

h

And the reason is this :

The Court as far as I

8

know has not established a blanket rule that no sanction can

9

attach to the invocation privilege.

10

We think that the case that is the closest to this

11

conceptually is the decision in Campbell Painting Company

12

versus Reid, last term? in which as the Court will well remember

13

a Wew York statute which the Court itself termed, 1, it was

14

intended to levy a penalty in order to deter people from

15

invoking the privilege against self-incrimination provided
or
that a corporation which had contracts, corporation/individual

16
17

which had contracts with the State, to be ineligible for

18

further contracts would have its present contracts cancelled.

13

20
21

22
23
24
25

■If an officer, or the individual having the contract
refused to testify before the Grand Jury and waives privilege
in that decision over the dissent which pointed out that the
financial consequences of this cancellation were going to fall
directly upon the individual who had invoked the privilege,
because he was both the President of the corporation and the
principal shareholder.

15

1

The Court nevertheless held that the corporation was

z

in no position to take advantage of the penalty imposed because

3

of the President’s invocation of the privilege.

4

We think this case is a fortiori because we reject

5

the notion and the Sixth Circuit in Dean has held and this

6

Court in Helvering and other forfeiture cases

7

forfeitures are to penalize anyone.

0
.9
10

Q

held that

Well*, if you had taken out the gambling stamp

you couldn’t have, seized the money could you?
h

Well, if he had not paid the excise taxes, the

11

operation still would have been conducted in violation of the

12

Wagering Tax Act.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Well if he bought the stamp and filled out all

of this material and paid 10 cents in tax, you couldn’t have
seized the money, could you?
A

No# that is not true either because the record

shows that at Sportsman’s Park there were other individuals
apparently working for or at least with Mr. Angelini in taking
non-pari mutual wagers.
If any of those individuals were not registered, had
not paid the occupational tax the money that they collected
would still have been collected and used as the statute says
in violation of the Internal Revenue law.
So even though the money was then handed to Angelini
who was lawfully registered —
16

1

Q

If ail —

2

A

He was still subject to seizure*

3

Q

If all of the bookies in Sportsman's Park bought

4

stamps you wouldn't have been able to seise the money*

5

that right?

S

A

That is correct*

22
23

25

There would be no connection between the stamp

and the seizure?
A

13
14

As sliming they had all complied with the Internal

Revenue statutes there would be no basis for seizure under the

11
12

Is

The absence of the stamp is certainly the

ingredient in this case as far as we endeavored to prove that
made this money items used in violation of the Internal Revenue
law»
Q

1 suppose you argue that the Government insti™

tuting a forfeiture proceeding doesn't itself incriminate this
man or just a fact of forfeiture.

You first have to prove

he has been gambling, independent evidence,
A

We have to prove that someone was gambling and

that this money was used in the course of an unregistered
gambling operation.

The Government, of course, bears the

entire burden of proof and that is why it is quite different —
Q

But there is something incriminating in this
17

1

— there something incriminating, it is just flows from the

2

fact that you have proved he has been gambling?

3
4

A

Well., that is true, but in Grosso and Marchetfci

the same thing was true.

5

Q

6

A

So we couldn't prosecute.

7

Q

Why do you say unregistered gambling?

3

A

Because the occupational tax in Section 4.4.1„1

0

Q

I understand and the stamp,,

to

A

Yes., and the stamp ——■

11

Q

The stamp is the registering?

12

A

No, the next section, Section 4412 says that

Oh, yes.

13

people required to pay the occupational tax are also required

14

to register.

15
16

Q

In fact, as the Court said in Marchetti--—*
Well, when you said unregistered gambling I ifas

trying to be sure which registering you were talking about.

17

A

Well, I —

18

Q

You were talking about the second one, not the

19

20

stamp, the second one?
A

The Court said quite directly in Marchetti that

21

the two are interrelated and it is impossible to pay the

22

occupational tax without registering.

23
24
23

But I don't try to make

any distinction on that point.
Q

What if I violate the income tax law by paying

a dollar less tax than I owe.

Do you take everything I have
18

1

because all of it was involved?

2

A

No.

The cases are fairly clear.

These statutes

3

are not new and they have been construed on literally hundreds.

4

It has to be some property which is integrally related to the

3

violation of the statute.
Now, perhaps if your adding machine had been involved

6

7

in your computation of your tax liability and if you had

3

violated the Internal Revenue laws by deliberately failing to

9

pay it

,

10

Q

To my pen

and pencil X guess, too?

11

A

Even your

pen and pencil, that is

true.■ But,

12

your house wouldn't be seized or your car.

It is only the

13

property, as the statute says, that is used in violation of

14

the statute.
In the cases, including the case relied on by the

15
16

claimant for his Court of Appeals decisions say that the focus

17

is on the use of the property and there doesn't have to be any

18

specific intent to violate any particular Internal Revenue

19

statute.

3

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

The type of a consent —■—*

A

Well —

Q

Deodans.

A

Exactly.

It is fiction and no one contests that

but it is one that we think has meaningful content to if and
it is one

that the Court in Goldsmith-Grant Case, 254 U.S.
19

I

said is so primely fixed in Anglo-American jurisprudence that

3

in the absence of compelling circumstances that 1 don8t think

3

are presented in this case the Court should be reluctant to

4

repudiate 600 years of our jurisprudence»
It is a fiction but because it does historically and

5
S

legally operate irrespective of the criminal liability of the

7

owner and because this Court has consistently sustained the

a

Constitutionality of this type of forfeiture, we think it

9

critical that these statutes do not focus on the criminal

10

liability of the owner or the possibility that he might be able

11

to resist prosecution as in Marehetti and Grosso by invoking

12

the privilege against self-incrimination»

.

13

The focus in this case, this type of forfeiture is

14

on the property's use and we think that since property clearly

IS

has no privilege against self-incrimination it is inherently

16

a personal privilege»

17

We think the case follows rather logically from the

18

Campbell Painting Case where the Court said there that the

19

actual focus of the penalty in that case and I reiterate that

20

we do not consider this type of forfeiture penalty and this

21

Court has never treated it as such»

22

But in Campbell Painting the penalty focused on a

23

corporation which has no privilege and the Court said the

24

corporation

23

,

therefore, is in no position to complain th@t'

©n individual that the occasion for the penalty'has been the
20

1

invocation of the privilege by an individual,,
Q

2

What do yon think even if you are right that the

3

forfeiture wasn’t motivated by any desire to encourage the

4

payment of the tax or to encourage registration* what do you

5

think the operative effect of the forfeiture provision is?

6

you think ——
A

I think as a factual matter we can say fairly

confidently it does not provide any great impetus to an indi­
vidual to come forward and register.

A

The worst that can happen is that money which

has been used in violation of this act which may or may not
belong to me in the Dean Case from the Sixth Circuit $300*060
was involved and the District Court said that even though it
was seized from the home ©f th© Deans it apparently did not all
belong to them because they provided the banking clearing house
21

1

for the gambling operation.
I think that illustrates that the loss does not

necessarily fall on the person who otherwise would be compelled

to come forward to pay the tax and to register*

Q

How many different kinds of forfeitures does the

Federal Government have?

19

Do you have any idea?

20

A

Literally dozens.

That is literally dozens of

21

violations can result in certain types of forfeitures.

They

22

are not all, we concede, Internal Revenue forfeitures.

5

A

Yesj, sir.

6

I would like to say that we have argued that in-the"

'7

event the Court determines that Marchetti and Grosso could

8

apply to forfeitures of this type the decision should not be

9

made^ retroactive and should apply only to seizures made after

10

the date of those decisions,,
We think the Court's power to make new constitutional

11

12

rules ..prospective only now is well settled and that each of

13

the three factors to be considered cancels prospective appli­

14

cation in this case.
We have discussed the effect and the reliance in our

15

IS

brief and I would like to say that the terms of the purpose

\1

of the new rule we suggest that the protection of the Fifth

18

Amendment which would be the essential purpose of this rule

19

would not be measurably advanced by applying it in this type

20

of case retroactively when, by definition,, the individual has

21

not come forward to waive his privilege and has not given any

22

information which would be incriminatory.

Well, that would result in an affirmative here*

for refusal, actually, to waive his constitutional privilege.
The Government, of course, argues that it should on several
grounds.

Yet almost from the inception of the argument here

yesterday the Government relied on Boyd as authorising seizure
of these moneys.
Now last night I went to Boyd and studied it very

carefully.

I wanted to determine what was the source of this

argument that was made yesterday.

I could only find a possible

reference at page 623 of the Boyd opinion where the Court was
detailing antecedent history.
In considering the statute that made it mandatory
upon order of Court for a man to deliver his private books and
papers to determine whether or not he had paid the proper

21
duties the Supreme Court in Boyd said even the obnoxious writs

22
of assistance didn't go this far.

23
They said there when they entered into warehouses

24
onto ships they at least were looking for stolen property or

25
28

property on which no duty had been paid»

not as bad as what the contested statute in Boyd did.

But as I say, they were not endorsing searches in

convert the words from Boyd into an endorsement of violation of

16

the Fifth»
The Government’s invocation of Boyd yesterday on

17
18

argument I submit is both timewise inappropriate and context-wise

19

inappropriate.
It is clear, I think, from our argument that we rely

20
21

on Boyd and submit to this court that the decision of the

22

Seventh Circuit can only be reversed if Boyd is overruled and

23

abandoned.

The forfeiture here is $8600.

14

even if that does not happen, the practicalities of the matter

This $50 tax and the penalties and the interest that
accrue on it have already been accessed independently by the
Government and they have been collected.
The Government’s own actions in an independent

It would seem that the served

If that is the argument I submit to this

I submit

they are clearly punitive and, therefore, they are quasi­

that subject, or property subject to forfeiture enjoys no
privilege against self-incrimination which can be asserted to
prevent that forfeiture.
They say that this is an in rem proceeding brought
against the property itself and it may not avail itself of
the owner's privilege against self-incrimination»
We submit to this court that this argument was refused
long ago in the Boyd case which rejected any argument that the
technical character of a forfeiture as an in rem proceeding
against the property had any ill effect on the right of the
owner of the property to assert as a defense violation of his
constitutional rights.
The Court recognised this owner — the Court in Boyd
recognised the owner as a substantial party to the in rem suit
and, therefore, in a position to raise violations of this kind,
his constitutional rights,
I might say at this time that the case on which the

21

United States urged was in conflict with this case.

Their

22
case differs substantially in this regard.

Here we have a man

23

who is recognized as an owner by the Trial Court,
24

The Boyd case says as an owner*, recogned, he is a
25

34

?

substantial party and has right to raise his constitutional

z

rights» \
1 think it is very important to recognize that in the

3

4
S
6

Dean case the Trial Court found that the Dean's — the
claimants — were not the owners of the property»

actually the Deans would have no standing in that lawsuit.
Their claim as owner was rejected by the findings of

10

'11

12
13
14

IS
16

Therefore,

the Court,

I think that is a substantial difference between

that case and this and I thought I would like to bring it to
the Court's attention.
There is one basic difference, I might say, why we
rely on Boyd and we rely on Plymouth is the basic difference
between those cases and this one are in those cases the
pivotal point was the prohibition against using in a forfeiture
case evidence illegally secured from the owner.
Here we have kind of the other side of the coin.
They claim forfeiture of property because the owner refused

17
18
19

or omitted to give evidence against himself in violation of
his constitutional rights.
Because if he had waived his constitutional rights

20

there would be no forfeiture here.

The rationale of this

21

forfeiture action is the forfeiture of property invoking the
22
constitutional privilege and I submit to this Court in the
23
truest sense of the word this makes the constitutional privilege
24
what has been used so often, this makes it costly.
25
35

The Government makes a further argument that in the

1

2

abstract that in order to be entirely innocent of any wrong­

3

doing or illegality and the property would still be subject

4

to forfeiture and in the abstract that can be true.
But here, necessary to forfeiture, is the illegal

S

6

intent of the possessor.

7

versus Pennsylvania made that eminently clear the difference

8

between properties that are forfeited per se and properties

9

that require proof of the use in order for them to come forth

10

with it.
Now, and it pointed out, that when dealing with

11
12

13
14

articles that are innocent in themselves as the money is here,
the articles derive their contraband nature only from the acts
ok

the intent of the possessor or user.
The act or the intent of Mr. Angelini, which is

22
23

25

This Court in One 1958 Plymouth

necessary to make this property subject to forfeiture, is first
the operation of the wagering business, is not illegal under
Federal law and secondly to failure to comply with the regis­
tration provisions of 4412 and the payment of the $50 under
4411.
To have been that it would under Marchetfci require
that he incriminate himself.
It is our submission most basically that no illegal
intent can be inferred from the exercise of or a refusal to
waive constitutional rights.

It is our position that property
36

arguments are going to suffice to forfeit these goods,

l

submit that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals should
be affirmed.
We then come to the aspect of this case that was not
presented to the Seventh Circuit.

This is the urging, by the

Government, of strict prospective application of the MarchettiGrosso decisions in forfeiture cases if this Court should
determine that they apply to forfeiture cases.
I would also submit to this court on that point that
the Government has made no argument to encourage this court
validly to employ strict prospect of the application.
Its own cases and I refer particularly to the case
it mostly relies on, Linkletter, recognised that the general
rule is retroactive application.

It also recognized in excep­

tion to that rule where a decision, an earlier decision, is
overruled as this Court by Marchetti-Grosso overruled Saferiger
and Lewis.
That rule is that intermediate cases finally decided
should not be upset.

This case, of course, is not finally
37

decided.

this court in Linkletter as being appropriate for circumstances

12
13
14

This standard of limited applicability referred to by

such as we have here is not even considered by the Government
in its argument.
It doesn't enlighten us what, if any, havoc would
ensue were the Marchetti-Grosso provisions made applicable to
forfeiture cases or how that would upset the administration
of justice.
They give us no contravaling considerations which
this Court recognized were necessary to strict application of
prospective application

that would take this case out of the

limited retroactivity rule.
The Government's whole argument relates to the
potentialities of a volume of litigation relating to property
forfeited in the past, finally forfeited.

And they say that

15
16

provides a sound and practical reason for this Court to apply
prospective application.

17
18
19
20

It pays no attention to cases not finally decided
such as this.

It gives no reason why this Court should not de-

cE-area limited retroactivity in accordance with the rule pro­
nounced in Linkletter.

We submit the rule should be employed

21

to cases such as this that are finally decided and we further
22

submit that no contravaling considerations have been suggested
23
by the Government for not employing that rule.

criminal part of the statute has been rendered uninforceable.

Well, it is no crime not to register or pay the

tax and this, there never had been a criminal law to sanction
registration or pay the tax just as though there was a Special
excise tax on gambling accompanied by a lav; which says that
if you don’t pay your tax you can have your winnings forfeited.

was tantamount to a criminal proceeding.
