Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
One Gordon McNeill, a stevedore-employee of the
Petititoner, Federal Marine Terminals, Inc., fell into the
No. 3 deep tank of the vessel QTTERBURN, owned by the
Respondent, on June 2, 1965, and was killed.

Thereafter, his

widow filed a wrongful death action against the vessel owners.
In a separate action the vessel owners, Burnside
Shipping Company, the Respondent, filed an action under the
Ryan Stevedoring Doctrine, seeking indemnification of any
amounts which they had to pay to the widow.
In a counterclaim of this petitioner, peitioner
sought to bring a direct action against the vessel, the
petitioner being a stevedoring contractor, and sought to
recover all the damages that it was exposed to under the
Longshoremen9s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, which had
a potential total liability of $70,000.
That counterclaim was dismissed upon the motion of

in the District Court.

The dismissal was

We are here on the limited question, and we submit

4

to this court th.at the question is, is there a stevedoring

5

contract implied in fact running directly between the vessel

6

owner and the stevedoring contractor?

7

We submit that the corollary question fairly

8

encompassed within that issue is, does the Longshoremen’s

9

and Harbor Workers" Compensation Act act as a shield to the

10

vessel owner to isolate the vessel owner from any liability

11

directly against the stevedoring contractor?

12
13

Q

Was the stevedoring contract made with the

owner, the vessel owner or the charterer of the vessel?

14

A

It is outside the record, Your Honor.

15

Q

The reason I ask the question is I notice

16
17

19

20

24
25

something in the briefs about it.
A

There is an allegation in the brief of the

Respondent that the stevedoring contract was made between
the time charterer and the stevedoring contractor.
Q

But that is a fact that destroys any basis for

the implied contract, isn’t it, with the vessel owner?
A

We submit not, Your Honor.

3

owner, the time charterer controlling if the vessel is going

4

from one city ox* one port to another.

5

6
7

8

We submit that it is not dispositive at all of this
issue and that it does not bar this question,
Q

Your claim, then, is entirely contractual in

nature and doesn't rest in tort at all?

9

A

Not at all, sir.

10

Q

Is there any tort theory that xrould be of any

11

aid to you?

12

condition of the vessel would have some obligations to the

1.3

people who are on it just in ordinary tort.

A

I suppose whoever is responsible for the

15

16

tort theory.

17
18
19
20

Should I ask why, or is that forbidden?

A

I would state bluntly under a tort theory, if

we sued, we would sue as subrogee,
Q

Why, because you think the Harbor Workers Act

would catch you there?

22

A

24
25

We abandoned any resort to a

21

23

It is based on the contract,

Yes, Your Honor.

We would sue as subrogee, and

then under the Ryan Doctrine the shipowner would turn around

and sue the stevedoring contractor, and—

Is it because of some negligence of the one in

control of the ship certain equipment of the stevedore which

is brought on the ship is damaged, along with an employee of the

stevedore? Certainly the stevedore might in tort be able to

recover for damages to the equipment, wouldn’t he?

We suggest and urge to this court that the Ryan

25

Yes, Your Honor, but that is not the instant

Stevedoring Company case in 1956 established that there was a
stevedoring contract, even though unwritten, which was implied
in fact.

Under this stevedoring contract certain duties 'were

owed by the stevedoring contractor directly to the vessel
owner.

If a violation of those duties by the stevedoring

contractor, the very essence of that duty having been defined
in that case as being the proper performance of the stevedoring
contract, either offloading or onloading the cargo — if there
be a violation of those duties, the vessel owner could recover
complete indemnification from the stevedoring contractor for
any amounts that the vessel owner became obligated to pay to an
employee of the stevedoring contractor who was injured aboard
the vessel.
That case focused on side of that relationship, the
duties owed by the stevedoring contractor to the vessel owner.
It also stated that the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’
Compensation Act did not preclude the vessel owner from being
sued by the employee of the stevedoring contractor under a
6

1

tort theory

and the vessel turning around, if there was a

2

judgment against him by the stevedore, and recovering the

3

full amount of that judgment directly from the stevedoring

4

contractor, based on a hreach^of“contract theory»

j

This court announced in that decision that the tort

5

6

theory was not to be confused with the contract theory, that

7

the action by the vessel owner against the stevedoring

8

contractor was directly based on contract and not any tort

9

theory <»
We read in the Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company case

10

in 1958 the warning announced by this court that the vessel

11

owner can be precluded from recovering directly from the

12

stevedoring contractor if there might be conduct on his part

13

to preclude such recovery.

14

This court did not go further to

define what that might be.

15

In 1959, in Hugev versus Dampskisaktieselskabet

16

International, the District Court, which was affirmed by the

17

Ninth Circuit — and certiorari was denied by this court —

18

the District Court announced what the duties of the vessel

19

oxvner were under the stevedoring contract, even though it be

20

unwritten, stating that these ware implied in fact.

21

In essence

these duties were to provide a reasonably safe place to work

22
23

and to give warning of any latent danger.

24

quoted in length in our brief, and I briefly summarize them.

25

But, in essence, those are the duties.

I

These duties we have

In the Hugev case, because the stevedoring contractor

•i
2

knew of a violation of these duties by the vessel owner and

3

thereafter assumed the risk, recovery was denied.

4

duties were thoroughly announced in that case.

But these

9

The owner does not turn over to the stevedoring

We submit to this court that there must be a reason­

10

able time for the stevedoring contractor to inspect that

11

vessel and to discover and correct any faults in that vessel

12

that might exist.

13

If the shipowner can turn over to the stevedoring

14

contractor a vessel in any condition, be there hatchboards or

IS

otherwise which are misplaced or weak, then we suggest this

IS

would encourage willful and wanton misconduct, because under the

17

Ryan Doctrine the stevedoring contractor has almost an

18

absolute liability for indemnification to the vessel owner,

19

20

Q

But the shipowner is always going to be liable

to the injured workmen, isn’t he?

21

A

Yes, Your Honor, usually,

22

Q

Something very close to absolute liability

23
24
25

under the Unseaworthiness Doctrine—
A

Yes, Your Honor,

Q

—plus liability for negligence, I suppose.
8

1

A

Yes.

2

Q

And this, I should think, would operate as

3

something of a sanction against the shipowner to keep a

4

seaworthy and shipshape ship, wouldn't it?

5

A

But it doesn’t in all cases.

8

Q

This theory of yours, has any court accept it

8

A

In the Hugev case it was announced.

9

There is a contract-—

7

ever?

10

Q

I mean this theory of yours of recovery.

11

A

Of a contract?

Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act—
A

No, that hasn’t—

Q

Recovering over against the shipowner——

A

That theory has never been tested.

G

Your theory has never been advanced before,

much less prevailed.
A

Is that right?

It has never been tested in any court other

than this case.
Q

You do have, of course, under the statute

certain rights of subrogation, don’t you?

23

A

We have rights of subrogation, yes, sir.

24

Q

And it is only because of the statute that you

25

are liable at all, isn’t it?
9

A

No, Your Honor»

3

Q

You were liable with fault—

4

A

No-—

5

Q

It is only because of the statute that you are

liable without fault.

Isn't that true?

It was extended to without fault, the Long­

shoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
Q

9

A

10
11

Before that statute there was

Yes.
The Ryan case announced that there was an

implied, in fact, contract.

This court has announced only what

12

duties flow from the vessel owner from the stevedoring

13

contractor to the vessel owner under that contract.
This court has never announced what duties flow from

17

19

2!
22
23
24
25

the vessel owner to the stevedoring contractor under that
contract.

We suggest it is not a unilateral contract and that

duties must flow from each side to the other»
Q

Are you claiming on an implied kind?

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Even though Your Honor

disagrees with the majority opinion in the Ryan case, we rely
on the majority opinion on that.

And since there is a contract

announcement implied in fact, we say it has to flow both ways,
the duties thereunder.
Q

What would be the implied duties?

A

The implied duties are announced in the Hugev
10

1

case ana are essentially summarized as "a duty by the vessel

2

owner to provide a reasonably safe place to work.5'

say "a safe place»"

We don’t say to hand over an seaworthy ’

Wa say only wa reasonably safe place to work."
Q

5

We don’t

So you would define by "contract" what essen­

6

tially might be in terms of tort law owed to visitors or

7

invitees.
A

8
9

Essentially — not invitees, no, just a

reasonably safe place to work.

10

Q

11

A

For whom?
For the employees of the stevedoring contractor

12

and for the stevedoring contractor, when he puts his employees

13

aboard„

14
15

Q

Which is about the same duty you would owe them

in tort law?

16

A

The employees or the stevedoring contractor?

17

Q

The stevedore and his employees.

A

Wo, Your Honor, because under the admiralty

18
19

law to the employees of the stevedore under the Sieracki

20

Doctrine, the vessel owner is to supply those employees with a

21

seaworthy vessel.

22

Q

That is right.

23

A

That is a liabilitywithout

24

Q

Yes, but a violation thereof.

25

A

We don't claim-—
11

fault.

Q

1

Yes, but can a stevedore sue the shipowner also

2

in tort?

He can sue him both for unseaworthiness and for

3

tort on the negligence theory, can't he?

4

A

Yes, both.

Q

So you are really implying that the negligence

Now, how did the Kugev case arise?

The stevedoring employee recovered—”

Q

Against the shipowner?

A

——against the shipowner.

And the stevedoring

contractor had sought indemnification, and was prohibited from
it due to the fact that they had assumed the risk.
But in Hugev case, which we have set forth in our
opening brief, the duties that the vessel owner owes directly
to the stevedoring contractor.

In the Hugev case the Court

decided there was the contractual relationship directly
between the vessel owner and the stevedoring contractor, even
though unwritten.
This court has said that in Ryan case, too, but this
court has never passed upon the question of the duties flowing
from the vessel owner to the stevedoring contractor.

19

However, Section 933 (i) of the act warns us that

It does not go further.

25

Perhaps

MR. MC CAMBRIDGE;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
I would first direct my answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's
inquiry about whether the vessel was on time charter or whether
the owner had entered into some contractual relationship with
the stevedore.
The answer is in the record.

There was an allegation

in the libel that — it is on page 5 of the Appendix.
15

It is

1

paragraph 7 of the libel, in which we allege that the work of

2

the Respondent was being performed pursuant to an agreement

3

between the Respondent and the time charterer of the vessel,

4

Federal Commerce and Navigation Company, Limited, a corporation

5

affiliated with the Respondent»

6

Appendix that allegation in the libel is admitted.

7

think there is too much question that the vessel was under time

3

charter, and certainly that leads us right into immediately

9

one of the principal contentions that we make to this court.

So I don't

That is that there is no privity of contract between the
stevedore and the Petitioner — 1 am sorry, the stevedore and
the shipowner.
Therefore, absent a contractual relationship,
certainly there cannot be any implied duties running from the
shipowner to the stevedore,
Q

Would the stevedore owe the shipowner any duties

under Ryan?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

In spite of lack of privity?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Contractual duties?

A

Yes, sir.

I think that has been——

That was decided by this court that

the shipowner was a beneficiary of the contract between the
stevedore and time charterer.

I think it was Reed versus

Yaka Steamship Company.
16

Q

i
2

A beneficiarys which would be different than

making him liable on the contract.
A

3

I think this is one of my opponent's principal ■

4

it seems to really trouble him that he feels he doesn't have

5

an equal shot at the shipowner, that he is under some more

6

stringent obligation to the shipowner than the shipowner is

7

to the stevedore.
The Petitioner's counterclaim upon which it bases

8
9

its claim to indemnity is based upon allegations that the

io

shipowner was negligent and that the shipowner breached a duty

11

owed to the stevedore that it would furnish its longshoremen

12

employees

13

a safe place to work on board the vessel.
Q

All we have before us in this case — and tell

14

me if I am mistaken, because maybe I am — but I understood

15

all we had before us in this case was the grant of a summary

16

judgment to your client on the Petitioner’s counterclaim.

17

Is that right?

18

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

The Court agreed

19

with us that the counterclaim was defective as a matter of

20

lav/, because—

21

22
23
24
25

Q

As a matter of law.

A

—because essentially it stated a tortious

claim of action rather than one under contract.
Q

The Court denied a counterclaim on the other

branch of the case.

It denied a summary judgment on the case.
17

1

A

Yes, sir,

2

Q

It denied a summary iudcrment on the claim but

3

granted a summary judgment on the counterclaim as a matter of

4

law, holding, among other things, that the Federal statute

S

was controlling in this situation and granted subrogation.

8

Do I misunderstand what that is-—

7

A

That is correct, Mr, Justice,

8

Q

I gather you argue, then, that whether there is

9

an implied provision in the contract between the time charterer

10

and the stevedore or not, that does not make the shipowner

11

liable,

12

A

This is a question that is not really before

13

this court.

14

with the efforts being made by shipowners to contractually

15

I am sorry — not shipowners — by stevedores to contractually

16

work their way out of the predicament they are in, where they

17

find themselves many times responding to what they consider is

18

the ship’s liability in this area of the law, where the

19

shipowner has his right to indemnity against the stevedore

20

for breach of its warranty of safe performance in the service

21

of the vessel.

*

This could arise-, and it will arise, >T think,

r

22
23

Q

You don’t urge here that the shipowner should

be shielded simply because there is a lack of privity?

24

A

No, sir.

This is ancillary-—

I

Kemerick, that the shipowner owes the duties to use ordinary
care and to warn of hidden defects.

He owes these to all

persons who are lawfully aboard his vessel.
Therefore, it is clear, I believe, and obvious that
these are not duties arising by virtue of contract but that
they are independently owed duties and they are tort duties.
Now, the stevedore has brought his counterclaim,
alleging that he has an independent cause of action against
the shipowner under contract and separate from the action which
is given under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers9
Compensation Act.

He says that Section 33 of that act

provides a statutory method by which an employer may be
reimbursed for the compensation expenditures that it must pay
to its injured employeese

But he says that because the act

does not specifically bar an independent cause of action,
therefore it should not preclude this action.
We feel that that argument is false, or at least
the fallacy can be demonstrated by the fact that prior to the
enactment of compensation statutes generally and this statute
in particular, an employer had no non~negligent liability
for injuries to its employees.

Therefore, we feel that a

proper construction of the statute says that if the liability
stems from the statute, certainly then the corresponding right
21

1

to be reimbursed must also be predicated upon that statute»
1 feel the. Petitioner's principal complaint here is

2
3

that he doesn't have a complete remedy under the Longshoremen's

4

Act, by reason of the fact that if he takes under that act, as

S

the assignee or the subrogee of the employee's claim, then he

6

will be limited to the $30,000 maximum recovery, which was

7

permitted under Illinois law in effect at the time of this

8

action»

9
10
1!

However, it is maintained that the employer or his
insurance carrier's potential liability is $70,000»

Therefore,

he is going to be at least $40,000 out-of-pocket right away

12

if he cannot find a way to get around the Longshoremen's and

13

Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.

I believe that this question of the possibility or
likelihood that there would be cases in which the injured
employee in bringing his cause of action against a negligent
third party — there were cases in which he would recover
less from the negligent third party than he might against as
a result of his entitlement to compensation benefits»
The Congress covered this in subsection {£) of
Section 33«

It isn't in the Appendix, but it is in the

Petitioner's brief, on page 3 of Petitioner's brief.
In contemplating what would occur when there was a
deficiency in the employee's recovery the Congress 4&d not say
or did not enact that the employer or his compensation carrier
22

1

might have a separate cause or additional cause of action

2

against a negligent third party to recover the deficit that it

3

might have from its right to be reimbursed or to recover from

4

the employee's recovery.

5

employee, it said that the employer shall pay to the employee

6

any deficiency between what it recovers from the negligent

7

third party and what it was entitled to under the Compensation

S

Act.
The act, I think, is designed to protect employees

9
10

But instead, in protecting the

rather than employers, to some extent, anyway.
We feel that the Congress in enacting this statute

11

12

specified and set forth a particular manner in which reimburse­

13

ment could be achieved by the employer.

14

mode of reimbursement under the statute is very plain.

IS

compensation statutes have been consistently interpreted to

16

cover the entire area of industrial injuries.

17

where Congress has provided a means of recovery, I don't

18

think it is necessary to go outside the act.

recovery must be found within the four corners of the act.

The question is, can he recover up to $70,000, which is the

a cause of action under which he can recover.

Q

You may answer the

question.
MR. MC CAMBRIDGE?

If the shipowner does, in fact,

impliedly warrant that it will 'observe a tort obligation to
use ordinary care or to warn of hidden defects, or if it owes
the duty to furnish a safe place to work, not only to the
38

I

individual longshoremen, which Sieracki says it owes, but it

2

also owes that same duty to the stevedore employer to furnish

3

its employees a safe place to work.
The whole balance in this area of indemnification

4

S

between shipowners and stevedores will be thrown out of balance

6

because in every case the fact that a shipowner has failed to

without fault.
has.

It is the absolute non-delegable duty that it

In every case that would prevent its recovery of indemnity

against a stevedore, because it would be a breach of contract.
It would be a breach of warranty, that it would furnish a safe
place to work.
How, the cases have never held *»- in fact, the cases
are in accord that the shipowner does not warrant to a
stevedore that it will furnish this seaworthy vessel. The duty
to furnish a seaworthy vessel and the duty to provide a safe
place for longshoremen to work is identical —= it is the
identical obligation, really.

And the injured longshoremen

recover in these cases because the shipowner has breached this
duty to furnish a safe place to work.
Q

May I ask you just this one question?

Suppose they admit a contract with the stevedoring
company to bring your men over this gangway, this walking place
right here.

He brings them over.

It is discovered that with

the knowledge of the owner of the ship that thing has been so

1

defective, it is absolutely bound to break and let him go into

the sea,

What about that?

it broke, and he went into the sea and was drowned.

A

4

In that case I would say that the injured or

5

deceased could recover from the shipowner, and the shipowner

6

would be prevented from recovery of indemnity from the

7

stevedore because, obviously, the ship's gangway is something

8

that is furnished by the shipowner.
*

These are not the decisions of this court.

MR* HOUGHs

I would like to point out to the Court

9

that the Respondent recognized that changing law here would

10

perhaps have a decided impact on the industry, in that Ryan

11

changed the law existent up to that time and as had been

12

enacted under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers*

Compensation Act, long before the advent of Ryan.
I would like to point out to the Court that the

14

position of the law* now is, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, the

IS

Hugev case makes the very definite statement that the law, not

17

the holding that absent~an~express provision to the contrary,

18

19

stevedoring contract the implied, in fact, obligations.
The Ninth Circuit holds there is an implied, in fact,

20
21

22

contract.

The Seventh Circuit holds there is none.
We ask this court to clarify the law.

And we urge

23

that there is this implied, in fact, contract, under which

24

duties flow both ways, and, secondly, that the Longshoremen’s

25

and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act was not designed to and
