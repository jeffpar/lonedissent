ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID LEO UELMEN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. UELMEN:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

10

Court:

This case does present the same legal issue that was

11

presented in the previous case, although the language of the

12

contract is slightly different, and in our opinion there is no

13

mootness problem here and to that end we did file a supplemental,

14

brief a few days ago to which, I believe, Justice Fortas

15

referred

earlier.

16

Q

This is here on Certioari, isn’t it?

1?

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

18

Q

The basic issue

19

there may be a money claim

■

pending — but the question in my mind is whether it is a matter
)

20

on which we would have granted Certiorari, if the facts have

21

been established, if the facts

22

existed at the time that we considered the petition a

23

Certiorari.

24

A

J

25

that

seem to exist now

Well,of course, the merger facts didn’t exist

at that -3

i
1

Q

I know that but I say that if they did the

I

2

question is whether we would have issued the rest here.

3

A

You mean because the amount of dues paid to

4

the brotherhood by the individual claimants and their class

5

was a small amount of money?

S

Q

Well, not that so much as the underlying

7

issue seems to be one of which might not be appropriate.

3

don't know whether it is or not, because we haven’t heard from

9

the other side.

The other side filed nothing here and

I

I

10

noticed your supplemental pleading here but I don’t know that

11

Certiorari would have been granted.

12

wouldn’t have, but I just don’t know that Certiorari would

13

have been granted because here you have people arguing a very

14

important issue on the basis, not of a basic conflict of

15

interest but on the basis of a relatively small money judg­

16

ment below.

17

A

I don’t know that it

Well, there was a small money judgment involved

18

in the Felter case against Southern Pacific also because it

19

involved Only the check-off dues of one particular man.

20

Q

I know, but ——

21

A

This difference in this case and in the previous

22

case, of course, is there was no restraining order issued in

23

this case.

24

As a result, the plaintiff and his class were compelled to

25

join the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and they were

The effort to obtain the restraining order failed.

4

1

compelled to pay dues to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.

2

When the appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals

3

fir the 7th Circuit those plaintiffs argued to that court that

4

they wanted the case remanded to the trial court for the purpose

5

of having their dues money that they had paid to the Brotherhood

6

restored to them.

7

That issue, of course — the issue of money damages —

8

still makes this a live issue or a case of controversy for

9

this Court, because even if this Court does, pursuant to a

10

mootness point, reverse and remand and vacate the judgment,

11

then these individual plaintiffs and the class that they repre­

12

sent will not be restored to the dues that they paid and would

3
4

still have the claim for that money.
Q

Mr, Uelmen, I expect it is as Justice Fortas

5

suggested that this case may not be moot but if you are familiar

10

with Monroe's case of that kind where there have been occurrences

7

since the grant of Certiorari which make it, in our judgment,

8

a case not to be decided, we dismiss it as a improperly

9

granted and I expect that is

the case here, isn’t it?

20

A

Well --

21

q

About whether or not this issue ought to be

22

decided in the context as to the money claim, or await an

23

actual application of the same 3ort of thing in some contest

24

between this new union and the engineers.

f

25

A

Well, I think that if the case is remanded to
5

t i

f

i

the lower court,the Federal --

2

Q

That wouldn't be what would happen.

The Writ

3

would simply be dismissed as improperly granted and the

4

judgment below would stand? that is the choice,! expect.

5

A

And then --—

6

Q

But there are still proceedings to go on in the

7

lower court if that would happen.

S

A

Well, yes.

The individuals would certainly have

the right to, if they so desired, and I think under the class
10

action rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

11

member of that class would have to be notified that the Court

12

intends to act on their claims and they would have the right

13

to say whether they waive them or not.

each

From the letters that we have received and the

14
15

protests that were filed at the time they paid the dues, we

16

have no reason to believe that these members are going to

17

waive those claims.
They were not happy at all by being compelled to

18

19

join the brotherhood.

20

Q

How many are there?

21

A

Well, the individual claimants are six in number

22

and they purport to represent a class and, frankly, that

23

actual damages issue was never tried,

24

hundred.

25

so it could be several

I would say probably between 200 and 300 that were

compelled to join the brotherhood, and are not pleased about

it .

If the Court please, the court below

Q

S

Was the judgment of the court below stayed or

did the people cease being members of the brotherhood?

g

A

Well, we won the case in the district court.

7

So then the men, of course, were compelled to join the

e

brotherhood.

9

Switchmen's, also, in other words, were members of two unions.

Now, some of them remained members of the

Then the court of appeals reversed

Unless the 7th Circuit opinion was stayed.

IS

A

There was no stay.

17

Q

I see.

IS

A

Then, of course, we filed the petition for

19

Certiorari here.

20

held that Section 2(11)(e) of the Railway Labor Act must be

21

read literally and that the legislative history

22

the literal reading of that statute.

23

The court of appeals for the 7th Circuit

supports

The court also noted, and stated, that in its judgment

24

the opinion of this Court in Ryehlik vs. Pennsylvania Railroad,

25

which construed the legislative history differently, was
7

1

dictum on that point-

2

opinion in the 3rd Circuit in Rohrer vs. Black Lick Railroad

3

was inapplicable because that railroad was owned by a steel

4

company and was organised on an industrial basis.

5

They also held that the Court of Appeals

With those positions, and with that reason of the

6

court below, of course, we disagree.

7

of this law shows clearly that Congress intended the Railway

8

Union to have a union shop agreement just like the industrial

9

unions have.

10

The legislative history

The one problem that kept coming up and being debated

11

was what they were going to do with the operating unions as

12

distinguished from the non-operating unions, because in the

13

operating crafts there was this craft progression from Firemen

14

to Engineer and back again to Firemen and between Conductor

15

and Brakemen and back again to Brakemen.

16

That argument was debated in Congress at some length,

17

and different proposals were made at various stages of legisla­

18

tive history.

19

the parties could just negotiate it out.

2

satisfactory.

21

At one time the proposal was made that, perhaps,
That wasn't

Another time a proposal was made similar to what we

22

did here, that the man would have to be a member of the

23

union that held the bargaining rights, and that proposal was

24

not adopted in that form.

25

Another was a proposal to simply issue a general
8

5

a

prohibition on requiring membership

in more than one union»

In the final analysis, everyone agreed to one very

3

important point, and that is that the only item they wanted

4

to correct, the only difference that they wanted in this parti­

5

cular bill, was to correct the problem of compelling a man to

6

become a member of more than one union.

7

They felt that a man should not be fdrced to pay dues

8

to one union.

9

the employer to compel him to pay dues to one union but they

10
it

The Congress was willing to.permit the union and

didn’t want him to pay dues to two.
With that concept in mind, and with that overall

12

objective, language was agreed to by the various unions and,

13

ultimately, adopted by Congress.

14

analyzed the legislative history on that section in the Rychlik

15

case and held that that legislative history must be read

16

carefully in order to understand the exact language of the

17

statute, and that the statute, itself, could not be read

18

literally on its face.

19

This Court, exhaustively,

The court adhered to those holdings in the Felter

20

case that the statutory language must be read in the light of

21

solving this problem and that problem we agree with and we

22

have incorporated into our collective bargaining agreement

23

specific language which states that if the man has a right

24

to work in another craft, such as a conductor, and if the

25

conductors have a contract with the railroad under which it is

9

l

1

compulsory, unionism is a factor, he can become a member

2

and remain a member of the Conductor's Union.

3

That, we say to the Court, solves the problem that

4

Congress was trying to reach and that is the man cannot be

5

compelled to become a member of two.

6

Switchmen's Union have on the Milwaukee Road?

1

It has no contract.

But what does the

It cannot negotiate a contract.

8

It never did have a contract since the Railway Labor Act was

9

passed, and it would be impossible for that union to negotiate

10

a contract with the employer that would compel the men to

11

become members of the Switchmen's Union.

12

With that in mind, we have asserted that the legisla­

13

tive purpose is served by compelling

14

remain members of the union that bargains for him.

15

union does not bargain for him, the union is just a stranger

18

to the property, which the Switchmen's Union was on this

17

railroad, that membership in that union could not be used to

18

satisfy the union shop requirements.

19

20
21

Q

the men to become and

Is there anything in the legislative history

that shows that Congress was aware of this problem?

You mean that — no, Your Honor, there is nothin?

A

The language of the Act literally read, of course -

2

if the language is literally read why soma modification would

3

have to be made of the Rychlik language.

4

Q

I don’t remember anything in the Rychlik opinion

7

selves to it.

11
12

Rychlik said several times, of course, that the

But what we were dealing with it in the context

of a union that still was a bargaining agent for the crafts.
A

13

Yes.

Of course, there are a very few railroads

14

in the United States in which the railroad is organized on

15

what we call a privy basis where the Engineers represent only

16

the engineer and the Firemen only the fireman and so on down

17

the line.

18

Q

Yes.

v

19

A

It is true that the legislative history didn't

20

consider that problem specifically, but it inconsistent with

21

the overall provisions of the union shop agreement and the

22

union shop statute to permit a man to satisfy the compulsory

23

union features of the statute by becoming a member of the union

24

that cannot, and does not, bargain for him.

25

Q

But it certainly was a standard thing at the
11

i

time this Act was passed and this amendment was passed for one

%

of the railroad unions to represent several crafts.

3

Oh, yes.

20

A

Well, no, because you may have a situation

21

where the trainmen and the conductors each have a contract,

22

and the trainmen do work as conductors from time to time.

23

Q

I understand that.

24

A

And, of course, the purpose of this language

of the statute was to permit the man, even though he was

That is true, Your Honor.

I think, though, that

8

and the decision of the Court of Appeals in Rohrer vs.

14

Mr. Uelmen, I think, on occasions, you have

that the

I think that there was an agreement

between

22

whether the employee may get a minority union — get some union

23

other than the collective bargaining representatives — to

process his grievance for him or to represent him at a

25

grievance ?

14

1

A

Yes, I think that your Honor said that

z

Certiorari was denied yesterday in the McElroy case.

3

was a case, as I understand it, where the Engineer’s Union

4

holds a collective bargaining agreement with the railroad

5

and the Firemen's Union, which does not hold a contract,

6

did seek to and did, in fact, represent a particular man

7

under the Engineer's contract.

Q

These cases aren't related?

@

A

Well, I think that the labor relations

That

?o

principle is fairly similar, although not identical, because,

n

although I can't argue with what you did yesterday, I do

12

say that it doesn’t again make labor relations sense to say to

13

a Union, like the Engineers who had the contract with the

14

carrier, we are going to let soma other union interpret that

15

contract, enforce that contract, settle grievances under that

16

contract, and not even have the Engineers present or on the

17

scene when that is done.
Where this case is related, in a sense, that what

18
19

we are saying to a man is that, you have a union that repre­

20

sents y<3u and you can make him represent you, you can force

21

him to represent you, you can take him to court to make sure

22

he doesn't represent you unfairly, but we are going to let

23

him pay his dues to somebody else.
That is the evil that we are getting at in this

24
25

argument.

That is speculative.

What is speculative?

19

A

I am not certain as to whether they were ever

compelled to join the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and

abandon their membership in the Switchmen's Union of North

12

America, particularly inasmuch as the Chicaqo, Milwaukee

23

Railroad did issue a bulletin to all the employees that there

A

I believe it would be purely speculative on

10

my part to suggest that some individual may or may not file

a claim for damages based upon being compelled to join the

I

A

I have made every effort to ascertain from the

21

sin named individual plaintiffs whether or not they have any

22

continuing interest in this litigation —•-

23

Q

24

A

25

There are only six.
There has been no effort made to ascertain the

desires of the entire class.

If this were handled on the

19

basis of the Writ of Certiorari having been improperly qranted

this would be remanded to the District Court for further

proceedings.

I believe that cculd clearly take care of any
conceivable claims which may be advanced by any individuals.

6

Q

Well, if this Court should do that, that would

7

mean that the judge of the Court of Appeals would remain

8

standing and your opponent would have lost.

9

A

Well, we are in the unfortunate position of

10

having been requested by the United Transportation Union and

11

we are representing the same union now.

The unions have

Four of these operating unions have merged,

or consolidated, or whatever they did?

19

A

That is right.

20

Q

So it is only one union?

21

A

Yes.

22

Q

There remains a fifth one, however --

23

A

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which

24

is not a party to this litigation and at no time has been a

25

party to this litigation.

20

Q

1
E

Right.

They filed amicus briefs here in

support of the position, right?

3

A

Wo.

4

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers filed

5

amicus briefs in support of the position of the — Mr. Uelmen

6

here.

7

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,

S

however, filed amicus briefs in support of our position prior

9

to the merger of the unions.

10

Neither the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers nor

11

the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen are parties

12

to the litigation in the Erie case or are parties to the

13

litigation in the Milwaukee case and they are not parties to

14

the contract.

15

Q

I am wondering if it wouldn't be appropriate

16

for you to file something which happens here is that both

17

sides have come in and presented us with a new drama, a new

18

script, and this drama was to be enacted before this Court

19

on this day, the 14th of January, 1969.

20
21

Your adversary did file a supplemental pleading and
we haven't heard from you until this moment, have we?

22

A

No, you have not.

23

Q

I am wondering very much whether we oughtn't

24
25

to have one here just so we can be sure of who is on first
base,if anybody is, because at the moment everybody seems to

21

fa»

1

in between bases.

2

A

We would be very delighted ---

3

Q

You say these four have merged?

4

A

That is correct.

5

Q

They are now one.

6

A

One.

7

Q

Under what name?

8

A

Under the United Transportation Union.

9

That

embraces the Brotherhood of Railroad. Trainmen, the Order of

10

Railway Conductors and Brakemen, the Brother of Locomotive

u

Firemen and Enginemen, and the Switchmen's Union of North

12

America.
Q

13
14

Does that one union in the contract agree to

assume all the obligations of each of the merging unions?

?S

A

That is quite correct.

16

Q

Would everything go into the same

17

A

Yes.

treasury?

There is one treasury for all four

13

unions.

Now, it is a completely merged operation, and there

19

is a disputes committee set up within the United Transportation

20

Union to provide for overlapping interunion disputes.
Q

21

Suppose it should be turned up later, which I

22

gather it is most likely to be, that some person has been

23

injured by this union that has been absorbed into the one

24

union — is it possible for him to sue this big merged union,

25

now?

22

i

A

There have been suits already instituted.

2

Mr. Uelmen referred to a suit brought in the South which has

3

been dismissed, as of this date.

4
5

But I suppose there will be matters litigated with
respect to this merger for some period of time.

6

Q

What you are really saying is, that,from your

7

standpoint,at the moment, based on your present information,

8

you think the case is moot, and,therefore,it would be appropriate

9

for the Court, in your view, to not only remand the case but

m

to vacate the judgment of the law so that there ar<i only

ii

future claims — in other words, the Brotherhood will be

12

protected in that

13
14

A

fashion? is that your point?

I believe the Brotherhood would be protected

in that fashion.

15

Q

How could anyone be injured by it?

18

A

I can’t conceive of anybody having been

17

injured by

18

agreement.

19

the effect of what occurred as a result of the

Q

Would you submit a memo to us in response to

21

A

Certainly.

22

MR. UELMEN:

20

it?

One minute, Your Honor.

To answer

23

your question, if the case is remanded and vacated, similar

24

to the preceding case, and if that is the end of it, of course,

25

nobody will have any problem.

But, it does seem to me that

23

1

because the plaintiff pleads a representative suit here, a

2

class action, it does seem to me that when it goes back to

3

the District Court, that class under the Federal rules is

4

going to have to be circularized in some fashion to find out

5

if they want to have their dues refunded because they certainly

6

claimed that in the case so far and if the individuals do

7

claim that they want their dues refunded, as far as I know the

8

United Transportation Union is not going to just write them

9

out a check.

10

We are going to be back in the —■-

11

Q

12

Do you have any idea how much money there is

involved in this?
A

13

No, I can't honestly say that, Your Honor.

14

think that

the sum is fairly small.

15

would be more than a couple of thousand dollars.
Q

16

I

I would doubt that it

Whatever the legal situation is, given the

17

merger, maybe you would find that better to refund all that

18

money as a practical matter than to go through an expensive

19

litigation, to litigate an abstract question of this kind, as

20

it is now.
A

21

I think that is a possibility.

But also, on

22

the other hand, I think the answer of the organization would

23

be that they have spent that money right up to the Supreme

24

Court now.

25

Q

Well, it is very disappointing — any litigant

24

?

who comes up here and then finds himself out of a case.

z

is very disappointing.

3

A

It

Well, if all of the claims would be dropped,

4

I think that if counsel for the respondents could say that

5

he is authorized to drop all claims, that would be the same

6

situation as the previous case.

7

Q

But I am not sure that the class section --

8

the District Court would have to give notice in the event

9

that the judgment were vacated on the grounds that there is

to

no case of controversy as it presently stands.

IT

That would be quite different from the situation

12

where the District Court dismisses the complaint or proves

1.3

a settlement or something like that.

14

there is at least that possibility.

15
10

17

A

:

It would also be possible, if you did that, to

cite the Rychlik v. Pennsylvania Railroad.
Q

Mr. Uelrcen, did I correctly understand your

adversary suggesting that perhaps none of these dues were

19

collected from anyone in that class of 200 or 300.
A

No, the dues were definitely collected.

We

21

printed it in our appendix — just one letter that we received

22

from a man who made it very plain that he was unhappy about

23

joining and there was just literally dozens and dozens of

24

protests made when the rnan came in and paid under protest.

25

I1

I suggest to you that

18

20

■

Q

Perhaps I misunderstood.

When these unions

25
r

merged was there any consideration given to either one of
2

these cases?

3

Why do you leave it until this last moment and then drop it

4

into our laps?

5

6
7

A

Couldn't they have all been worked out then?

Why?
Well, the merger was effective January 1 of this

year, Your Honor»
Q

How long has it been -— I think I would

8

appreciate that unions don’t merge overnight»

9

going on for quite awhile.

10

11

A

This has been

As a matter of fact, merger of these unions

has been talked about for years and years, but specifically --

12

Q

Weren't these two cases discussed?

S3

A

They were not settled in the merger at all.

14

Q

Weren't they discussed?

13

A

16

Q

Well, couldn't they have been settled?

17

A

I suppose it is possible for them to have been

18
19

Your Honor, I really don't know because ---

settled, yes.
Q

And then we woulnd't have any trouble.

Now,

20

instead of doing that on your own, you are asking us to find

21

some way to get the case back to the other court so this

22

can be litigated all over again.

23

A

No, Your Honor, we are asking you to reverse

24

the case based upon the precedence here of Rychlik v.

25

Pennsylvania Railroad and --

26

i
2
3

Q

But we don’t have anybody versus anybody here.

I

We have union versus the same union.
A

No, Your Honor, there are individual plaintiffs

4

here, named individually and purporting to represent a class.

5

That is the only difference between our case and -I

6

Q

Well, who represents them?

7

A

Well, Mr. Leihik represents ---

8

Q

He just told me he represents your union.

0

A

Well, Your Honor, I think you put your

10

finger right on the problem because in that case those

11

individuals are unrepresented at this point.

12

13

Q

What bothers me about this is that you filed

this document as of Januai'y 13.

14

A

That is right, Your Honor.

15

Q

I don't know when your merger was agreed on.

16

It became effective January 1.

17

A

That is right.

18

Q

January 13 was yesterday and now you and your

19

adversary are in here with very totally changed, basically

20

changed, set of circumstances and facts.

21

22
23

As far as I am concerned, I will await whatever
submission you make.
MR. LEIBIK:

I refer to the fact that no employee

24

of the Milwaukee Railroad was compelled to drop his membership

25

in the Switchmen’s Union and join the Brotherhood of Railroad

27

i

1

3

Trainmen»
Q

I must have misunderstood you.

In other words,

although not compelled, some may have paid.

4

A

That is correct.

5

Q

Well, they were compelled to join, they weren’t

6

7

compelled to drop their membership.
A

They were neither compelled to join nor drop

8

their membership on the basis of the bulletin issued by the

9

Milwaukee Railroad while this litigation was pending.

10
It
12

13
14
15
16

We know of no employee who was cited for noncompliance
with the union shop agreement.
Q

Do you know of any who, in fact, paid as

Mr.

Ue3.men suggested?
A

I know of none, personally, and I am speaking

only to the named plaintiffs.
Q

Speaking in somewhat of a switchman’s language,

17

as I understand it, what you are putting up to us is that the

18

snakes and the trainmen's union have become one?

19

A

20

Q

And the controversy is over.

21

A

That is quite correct.

22

Q

23
24
25

As they now are, yes.

Who represents

the individuals, the 200 or 300

member class?
A

We represent these individuals but we do not

believe and we have'

not bean informed by any member of the

28

1

class that there is any continuing interest in- this litigation

a

on behalf of those individuals.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
