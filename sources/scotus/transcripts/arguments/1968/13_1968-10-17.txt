ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD A, KAIER

11

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

12

MR, KAIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

13

Court.

14

Eastern District of Louisiana, setting aside an order of the

IS

Interstate Commerce Commission, vzhich described the divisions

IS

of joint rates to be received by the Northern ahd Southern

1?

Rciilroads respectively from freight traffic moving between

18

official territory and the Southern territory in both directions.

This is an appeal from the three-judge court for the

19

Official territory may generally be described as that

20

part as the Northeastern part of the United States and Southern

21

territory the Southeastern part.

22

More particularly, official territory would be the

23

territory east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio,

24

and certain cities in Virginia.

2$

Southern territory is east of the Mississippi and

3

i

2

south of the official territory.
The appellants are the Interstate Commerce Commission

3

and the Northern Railroads,

4

Railroads and two associations, one the Southern Governors

3

Conference and the other is the Southeastern Association of

6

Railroad and Utility Commissioners,

The appellees are the Southern

7

Your Honor will recall, I believe, that a joint one

8

is one which applies two or more railroads but is stated in a

9

single sum.

The divisions in issue in this case were primary

10

divisions; that is to say, divisions which applied to and from

11

certain gateways between Northern and Southern Railroads and

12

there was more than one railroad north of the gateway, those

13

two railroads or three railroads would get their share of the

14

revenue from sub-divisions of the primary divisions and likewise

IS

south of the gateways.

16
17

Those sub-divisions are not in issue in this case,
only the primary divisions.

18

The railroads evidence, both that submitted by the

19

Southern lines and that submitted by the Northern lines, was

20

on a group basis in which all: the Northern lines were grouped

21

together and their figures submitted are on the group basis and

22

likewise for the Southern lines.

23

It was decided by the Commissioner on a group basil,

24

except that the Norfolk Southern Railroad, one of the Southern

25

group, was awarded divisions higher than that granted to the

4

1

z
3
4

Southern, lines generally
This was in recognition of its greater revenue needs»
There is no issue about that, before the Court»
The commissioner is empowered by paragraph 6 of

5

section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act to prescribe just

6

and reasonable divisions whenever, after hearing in its opinion

7

it finds that the existing divisions are unjust, unreasonable

8

or inequitable.

9

The case before the Commission was one that was

10

originally decided in 1953»

11

divisional factors prescribed for Southern lines were generally

12

25 percent higher mill for mill than those prescribed for

13

Northern lines.

14

Before that decision, the

On the very important item of citrus fruit which

15

moves in great volume from the South to the North, and earlier

16

case had fixed the divisions as high as 85 percent higher than

17

the Northern lines.

18

I should correct that.

The Southern lines didn’t

19

get divisions 85 percent higher, but the factors which go into

20

making them were 85 percent higher so that the Southern lines

21

got something less than the percentage of 85, but have

22

substantially more than the Eastern and the Northern lines.

23

In the 1953 decision, which is in the decision of

24

the same docket of the Commission as the order here under

25

review, in the 1953 decision, the Commission concluded that if

5

!

it were to give controling weight to the Northern lines cost

2

studies p it would have to give them higher divisions than the

3

Southern lines.

4

But it regarded soma elements of the cost as being

5

tranient in nature.

6

assumption for the future that neither gx*oup of railroads would

7

have a substantially lower basis of operating expenses than the

8

other.
So the prescribed equal factor divisions for both

&
10

It found that it would be the safest

groups of lines.
In 1959, that same proceeding was reopened upon

11

12

petition of the Northern Railroads.

They alleged in the petition

13

that the experience of the intervening years had confirmed their

14

contention that their costs were higher than those of the

15

Southern lines.
The commission reopened the case.

16

Evidence was

17

taken between 1959 and 1961 resulting in what the lower court

18

called a massive record.

19

report by two examiners recommending inquiries into the

20

divisions for the Northern lines, exceptions, replies and oral

21

argument.

22

There were extensive briefs, proposed

The Southern lines contended before the Commission

23

that the relative costs of performing the service involved

24

constitute the decisive measure in determining just and

25

reasonable divisions,
6

1

They urged the Commission to find such costs on the

2

basis of the average territory costs as shown by the Commission's

3

rail form A, form for

4

Southern territory lines respectively, but subject to

5

adjustments in those territorial averages costs which the

6

Southern lines opposed.

7

official territory lines and for
2

The Commission accepted five of the adjustments and

8

rejected seven.

9

certain services, per ton mile for certain others, for train

The resulting unit costs, costs per ton for

10

miles for others, those unit costs were then applied to the

11

Southern lines traffic study which those lines stated and the

12

Commission agx*eed accurately measured the transportation

3

characteristics of the precise traffic to which the divisions

4

involved applied.

5

The Commission found that the costs at which it

6

thus arrived —- that is, the form A territorial cost with the

7

five adjustments that were permitted ----- were reasonably

18

accurate and reliable for determining the relative contribution

25

It examined each of the other factors

It concluded that everything was equal except

It found the Northern lines cost higher than those

Southern lines

2

It concluded therefore that the relative costs of the

3

parties in performing the service could properly serve as a

4

guide for the determination of just, reasonable, and equitable

S

divisions,,

6

That then was the end of everything except to translato

7

the cost findings into the division scales»

The Southern lines

3

asked the Commission to base the divisional scales to be

9

prescribed on their cost evidence as modified to the extent

to

that any of their proposed adjustemnts might be rejected and

11

the Commission did precisely that.

12

Its formal finding, of course, was that the present

13

divisions were unjust and unreasonable, inequitable.

14

prescribed the new divisional scales from the Southern lines

costs as adjusted.

That is a stipulated figure.

Upon review by the Southern lines and the two

conferences that I have mentioned, the Southeastern Association

averages, that the Commission itself was obliged to see that

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Kaier , you may continue

/our argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD A. KAIER {resumed)

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6
MR. KAIER:

7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like

8

low to discuss the question whether the use of official and South

9

=srn territorial costs is supported by substantial evidence and

10

adequate findings of the Commission, or whether in truth the
District Court's opinion represents a substitution of its judg-

12

p.ent for that of the Commission as to the weight to be given evi­

3

dence and the degree of refinement necessary with respect to the

4

complex question of railroad cost.

5

Then I plan to discuss the passenger deficit issue, the

IS

Commission having included in the freight service costs a portion

7
8
0
20i
21

if passenger deficits.
Q

Before you start, would you straighten me out.

What is

;he difference between the costs and revenue need?
A

Cost, if Your Honor please, is fully distributed cost,

md revenue need ---

22

Q

Does that exclude any need for profit?

23

A

No, there is a return element in that, fully distri­

24
25

buted cost is a return of 4 percent on the value of the property,
Q

What is revenue need then?
-

0-

?
2

A

Revenue need is something over and above that kind of

cost.

3

Q

Investment?

4

h

No, it is a continuing operation.

If a railroad is

5

badly in need of revenue and division is based on relative cost

8

alone, even though fully distributed if they are not sufficient,

7

then the Commission has the power to award higher divisions in

8

order to keep that railroad in operation.

8
10

The Commission does have that power to grant something
over and above the cost of performing the service.

11

Q

12

A

13

For what?
I mean, it does not relate to anything, the railroad

needs the money.

14

Q

Who doesn’t?

15

A

It needs it to continue operation, it is not getting

What does it need it for?

16

enough money to continue operation and therefore it has to have

17

something over and above its fully distributed cost.

18

case on that is the New England Division Case, decided in the

19

'20's by Justice Brandies, in which that kind of a need was used

20

by the Commission.

21

The classic

Now, first, as to the Commission's findings, I believe,

22

Tour Honor, that a review of Appendix B to the Commission's repor-,

23
24

which contains 42 pages of discussion of the adjustments proposed
*
by the Southern lines will be convincing that the Commission has

25

set forth the reasons why it disposed of these cost issues in the
11

-

-

'i

manner in which it did.

2

further to say about findings in general.

1 will not at this point have anything

As to the factual support fox* the use of territorial

3
4

average costs, I would like to point out these things to the

5

Court.
First, the investigation brought in issue the divisions

6
7

of rates on virtually all articles moving between the North and

0

the South from every station in the North to every station in the

9

South over every Northern railroad and every Southern railroad.

10

It was territory-wide, both in the northern end and on the south­

11

ern end.
The fact that the proceeding was of such great scope

12

13

itself, a territory-wide proceeding, I submit established a

14

strong case for the use of territorial costs both generally and

15

with respect to such factors as car costs, switching, empty retur n

IS

ratios, and other large factors of that nature, as to which the

17

Southern lines said our higher costs, that is, they said that the

IS

higher cost of the Northern lines were attributable to these

19

facts.

20

Now in the Class Rate Case, which was affirmed by this

21

Court in New York v. The United States back in 1947, the Commis­

22

sion said there are different degrees of refinement in costs

23

depending upon the purposes for which they are intended.

24

ascertainment of the costs of transporting a particular commodity

25

over a single railroad or a group of railroads obviously requires
-12

The

1

more refinement in procedure than the calculation of relative

2

costs for transporting all traffic for important and well-defined

3

segments of traffic by territorial groups of carriers.

4

The present case was clearly one involving relative

3

costs for transporting important segments of traffic by territorial

S

groups of carriers.

7

Q

Do the Northern roads and the Southern roads devote the

& same percentage of their cars and their property and so on to the
9

north-south traffic?

to

A

No, I don't think they do, Your Honor,

11

Q

What are those percentages?

12

13

Give me an illustration

in some respect.
A

The only illustration I can give you, Your Honor, is

14

that the north-south traffic involved for Southern lines is very

15

much greater than for Northern lines.

16

20 percent for Southern lines and about 6 percent for Northern.

17

Q

I believe that it is about

Just off hand and a matter of first impression, that

18

is what makes it kind of surprising, off hand, that the Commission

19

would use totality costs of any of these items as a basis instead

20

of correcting it for the particular traffic involved.

21

what it did, is it not?

22

A

That is

It did that, except to the extent that it allowed five

23

of the adjustments that were submitted by the Southern line and

24

declined seven, so you see, Your Honor, on the great body of

25

the cost, the territorial cost evidence, the Southern lines
13

-

-

1

themselves used the territorial costs.

2

percent of all the costs they submitted were the territorial aver--

3

aces „

4

Q

It amounted to almost 9

I know, but however that, may be, it did strike me as

5

being rather odd that the Commission would use this aggregate

6

basis in considering such a relatively small factor of the base

7

of the Northern roads, particularly, and of the Southern roads

3

and especially with the fact that a percentage was different in

3

the case of the North and the South, radically different?

10

A

If Your Honor please, in the Class Rate Case which was

11

the first case in which the Commission used cost evidence under

12

this formula •— before this formula Wets devised, they had no

13

reliable way of getting service costs -- in that case the percent

14

age that class rate traffic v/as of total traffic of the railroads

15

involved was an even lower percentage than that involved here for

16

either Northern or Southern lines, anci then there was the Moun­

17

tain Pacific Class Rate Case in which it was lower than this, ver

to

substantially low.

19

In the Transcontinental Divisinns Case, which Your

2

Honors decided very recently in Chicago, and Northwestern v. Sant

21

Fe Railway Co.,

22

adjustments and it concluded that in a case dealing with territory-

23

wide application of rates or divisions, that the territorial cost

24

and the refined costs are substantially the same.

25

in that case the Commission made a number of

I don!t mean to suggest that there was more refinement
-

14

-

I

there than there was here„

2

Q

Was there such a finding here?

3

A

Mo, Your Honor, there was not a finding in those words.

4

Q

Was there anything like it?

5

A

Yes, there was a finding thcit the costs, as adjusted,

Q

accurately and reliably represented the costs of performance of

7

the north-south service.

8

Q

9

mind, is it?

That is not quite pinpointed to the problem I have in
I think you are going to get to the commuter prob­

10

lem and to my mind, that perhaps most vividly presents the issue

11

that has troubled me.

12

A

Very well, Your Honor.

13

Q

There wasn’t any commuter problem isolated as such in

14
15
16

the Chicago-Northwestern Case?
A

No, there was not.
I would just like to say in pursuance for a moment of

17

the point I had been arguing that the present record establishes

18

that the north-south traffic is handled as an indiscriminate

19

part of the whole with all of the other traffic of the Northern

20

railroads and in view of the way the railroads are operated, the

21

same was true in the South.

22

tions, switching at origin terminals, line haul service in rod

23

trains or way trains, empty return ratios and all of those vari­

24

ous large categories of traffic.

25

This related to all the large opera­

I was going to say more on this first point, but I thin t
15

-

-

1

maybe I had better get to the passenger deficit point.

2

At the outset I want to point out that when the iJorthei

3

lines brought forth their cost study, they predicated it upon

4

great service costs alone.

5

of passenger service.

6

to the practice of the cost finding section of the Commission,

7

we have not included the passenger deficit, and they said, and

8

I quote their words,

9

computing constant costs without consideration of passenger defi

10
11

They had nothing in it for any kind

The Southern lines explained that contrary

"The Northern lines study is defective in

cits."
Now although it was to the disadvantage of the Northerr

12

lines that the Commission consider passenger deficits, because

13

we would have done better just on freight service costs alone,

14

we stated that we would have no objection to their inclusion,

15

but that we did object to the Southern lines proposal that there

18

be culled out of the passenger deficits so much thereof as might

17

be attributable to commutation service, which was the proposal of

18

the Southern lines.

19

They sought to justify that proposal, the proposal to

20

exclude commutation deficits upon the theory that commutation

21

service is frequently performed over facilities that are used

22

Eor that purpose alone and not used for freight or other passen­

23

ger service, whereas they said it is generality true that the kinc

24

of passenger service other than commutation incurs a deficit

25

principally or wholly because of the allocation of expenses to the
-16

t

1

passenger service which are common with freight.

2

They say that in the case of the regular passenger

3

service, intercity passenger service, if the passenger service

4

were discontinued, the costs would go on and have to be borne

5

by freight service.

6

Now the Commission analysed the Southern lines * conten­

7

tion in the context of the distinction which the Southern lines

8

thus urge between commutation deficits and the others being

3

allocated.

The Commission found that although many individual

10

items of expense could be regarded as solely related to suburban

11

service, that this was not true of the service as a whole and it

12

found that it could not be treated entirely apart from the freight

3

service and in concluding its analysis, the Commission said that

4

because the suburban service deficit includes common costs which

15

must be incurred to provide freight service and intercity passen­

16

ger service, the deficits from commutation service should not be

7

excluded from the constant cost allocated to the north-south

8

traffic.

19

Q

20

puted?

2?

A

Does either side challenge that it could not be com­

I did not intend to say it could not be computed.

The

22

Commissioni finding was because the suburban service deficit

23

includes common costs with freight service, the deficits from

24

commutation service should not be excluded from the constant costs

25

Q

I asked that question because I have been wondering
-

7

-

1

how strongly one can say officially, can accurately figure the

2

cost of passenger service and the cost of freight service for a

3

whole system of railroads. North and South.

4

A

Your Honor, it imposes very great problems.

5

Q

Hov; much of it is judgment, how much of it is findings,

6

?

and how much of it is guesswork?
A

Your Honor, in the case called Rail Passenger Train

0

Deficit, in 306 ICC at 714, decided in 1959, I believe that you

9

will find there an expression of the Commission to the effect tha

10

in deciding hew much of the common costs should be allocated, it

11

is largely a question of judgment and a rather speculative fact.

12

Q

307 ICC,

13

A

306 at 417.

14

Q

what page?

You started off by saying that they found the cost,

15

carried by the Northern railroads was more than the cost to the

16

Southern railroads?

17

A

Yes, Your Honor.

18

Q

Can they

19

A

Oh, yes.

20

Q

How?

21

A

They make this on the basis of the application of a

make that finding?

22

cost formula which they use day-in and day-out.

23

used by the Commission and by all the parties before it, includ­

24

ing the Southern lines, week-in and week-out.

25

Q

I understand that.
-

18

-

This is a formul

1

A

2

Q

Is it the whole formula or does it take samples?

3

A

Oh, there is some sampling in it, but by and large it

1 am speaking for the formula---

4

is an analysis of the accounts of the railroads which are kept

3

in accordance with the Commission's uniform system of accounting

G

and they will get a unit cost of performing this service or that

7

and then a traffic study is made to find out hov; many units of

G

that, service are involved in the service you are studying, and

9

they will apply the unit costs to that..

10
11

This is done day-in and

lay-out by the Commission.
Q

I understand it is done, but. how much of it is, really,

12

as you recid there from 306 , a question of judgment or a question

13

of an accurate finding of fact?

14

A

My reference to it being a matter of judgment had to

15

io with the passenger service and only those expenses of the

16

passengers that are common with freight.

17

this formula of the Commission for determining freight service

18

oosts was dependent upon judgment.

Q
Do they have to get it from the books of the railroad?

19

20
21

A

I did not mean to say

They get it from annual reports of the railroads which

account by account are submitted to the Commission.

22

Q

Do they analyze it in any way to see if it is correct?

23

A

The Commission regularly has an investor going and

24
25

checking the books of railroads.

Kind of a supervision?

Q

The initial Northern lines' position, as I understood

you, was that all this cost was limited to freight?

9

A

Yes, Your Honor.
*

10

Q

The Southern lines insisted that the passenger ratio

11

also be taken into consideration to the extent of intercity, but

12

not commutter?

13

A

Correct.

14

Q

1 gather intercity uses the same facilities as freight?

15

A

Sometimes it does, and other times there is enough of

16

it that there has to be an extra traffic, and certainly there has

17

to be stations and then you have direct expenses such as train

18

crew wages, locomotives, car yards.

19

ties which are attributable only to passenger service on the

20

intercity side as well as the commuter.

You have all of these facili

*

21

22

Q

Anyway this is the South justification, distinguishing

between intercity and commutter?

23

A

Yes.

24

Q

Because the South, I take it, does not have a commuter

25

problem?
-

20

-

1

A

That is correct.

There is one Southern line that has e

2

big commuter operation,, the Illinois Central, but by and large

3

they do not.

4

Now I would like to develop that point the-1 the non-

5

commutation passenger service has a great deal of expenses that

6

are solely related to that service, the kind of service that is

rendered down South, a local train service, intercity passenger

service.

12

Nov/ I believe it to be of great importance in connec­

13

tion with this point, Your Honors, to point out to you that, the

14

Commission allocated the overall deficit, that is, from all pas­

15

senger operations, to the north-south service, both for Northern

16

and Southern lines.

The Northern linas passenger revenues exceeded the

Now the Southern lines, on tfhe other hand,

We are the

The Commission's

t

allocation of costs included for us only common expenses which

2

the report says will be allocated for the Southern lines it

3

included not only common, but the solely related expenses, too..

4

Now, I should like to call attention to the fact that,

5

there is no question of the Commission’s power to consider pas­

6

senger deficits in making freight rates and submitting provisions

7

You held in the King Case that it was proper for the Commission

8

to consider passenger deficits in fixing freight rates and the

9

Court did not distinguish there between solely related costs and

10

the other costs.

11

Q

Is this limited to the division?

12

A

This is limited to the division.
Of course, the Commission ha.s considered the passenger

13
14

deficits in fixing the general level of freight rates and it

15

seems fair, therefore, to consider the; passenger deficits in

16

dividing the freight rates; but if they do, it ought to be the

17

overall deficits.
I would like to take just a minute from my rebuttal

time, if that is proper. Your Honor.

These appeals present a major importance to the ICC,

1

costs are not a proper yardstick for measuring north-south traffic

2

and that the Commission was required to produce more refined data

3

to ascertain the actual costs of that service.

4

In reaching that conclusion the Court below disregarded

5

key determinations made by the Commission.

6

the Commission's comprehensive analysis of Rail Form A and its

7

application to all of the units of service that were rendered in

8

north-south traffic, these units of service being the ones that

3

comprise what is being measured, the District Court paid little

to

First, in rejecting

attention to these findings and analyses of the Commission.
Secondly, the Court disregarded the findings made by

11
12

the Commission after its review of all of the evidence submitted

13

by the parties that, these costs reliably and accurately reflect

14

the traffic in question.

15

that the traffic moves over all railroads and between all sta­

16

tions in both territories and is not handled as a distinct entity

17

at all, but rather its average traffic handled as an indiscrimi­

18

nant part of all traffic and possesses no distinguishing charac­

19

20

Those findings were based on evidence

For this reason railroads

Now how do we obtain the costs for these services?

10

Mien there are direct costs, we can allocate them to the traffic.

11

When there are not direct costs, there are common costs, there

12

have to be some kind of emperical judgments made on determining

How is it done?

It is done on a revenue

I am where a railroad is a multi-purpose facility and

produces a number of transportation services, when we try to

17

ascertain, as here, if any given body of traffic uses physical

18

facilities in common and employee services in common with other

19

traffic, and it has been shown that it has no distinguishing

20

characteristics from any other type of traffic, it would appear

21

to us that the application of Rail Form A costs is plainly proper.

22
23

Q

Would you apply that principle to all problems under

the act?

24

A

I did not quite understand your question.

25

Q

Suppose you had a particular plan to ascertain the

costs of carrying particular types of commodities, you do that,

don’t you?

3

We do.

to do that or it always is worthwhile or that is the duty that

9

should always be imposed on the ICC, but certainly you do it

?o

I am not saying that it always makes sense

in some instances for some purposes.
What I have not got clear in my mind is what are the

11

12

special reasons here why you did not do it, particularly in view

13

of the relatively small amount of the overall costs and overall

14

traffic represented by the north-south traffic and especially on

15

the Northern roads?

16

far as I recall.

17

18

A

What is what. I have not heard yet or read sc

Mr. Justice Fortas, this is precisely what the Commis­

19

This traffic was shown to be not distinguishable
,
/
in any characteristics from any other traffic that the railroad

20

handled»

21

sion did hear.

Q

It is distinguishable.

It has a different point of

22

origin, different point of destination, it is north-south thru

23

traffic, and I don't suppose you are going to say that it would be

24

impossible or even impractical as a matter of accountancy to

25

break out costs for that segment of the traffic.
-26

-

You wouldn't

i

say that, would you?

2

A

The question I would ask is how do we get these costs?

3

We would get them by starting out with Rail Form A and trying to

4

make a segregation of all of the services that were performed

5

on north-south traffic.

e
7

Q

Don’t you think that is a very sensible way of doing

it?

8

A

S

Q

That is

precisely what happened in this case.

But you did not break it down.

What you relied on was

10

the Rail Form A aggregate costs, as I understand it, without

11

making any segregation whatever?

12

A

But

the aggregate costs,

13

services

14

it takes to provide any amount of traffic the railroads handle.

15

When you throw this all in one pool and you are using common

IS

facilities, you get a unit cost for each type of service.

17

you go to the railroad’s traffic study for a year which shows

18

all the service units that were rendered in performing north-

IS

south traffic and you multiply those unit costs of service again*

That is what the Commission did here.

Q

But a further refinement beyond that would be possible

23

would it not?

For example, isn't it necessary to decide here

24

whether it was or was not appropriate, just to take an illustra­

25

tion, to use these commuter cars?

-27

1

I think I understand your Commission's reason for it.

2

The Commission says that there are no separate facilities that

3

were there to use for the commuter passenger traffic and there­

4

fore the Commission says we did not break out those costs and

5

eliminate them for this particular purpose.

6

a problem, wouldn't you agree, a problem of standards?

/

A

But that presents

Here the Commission used fully distributed costs.

8

In the C&NW Case they 'used out-of-pocket costs, they did not

3

consider any of these overhead items and distribute it as to that

10

traffic.

11

used fully distributed costs.

So the distinguishing feature here is the Commission

12

Q

Nov; you get the question of should it?

13

A

This is a determination of costs which depend on

'14

policy.

IB

Court's decision in North Dakota in 1950, we cited it in our

10

brief| when costs are being considered, the Commission must not

17

only ascertain the costs directly pertaining to the service, but

18

it also must ascertain and apportion those costs which are joint

13

are not directly pertaining to it and every railroad has certain

20

overhead expenses.

21

The Commission has formulated a policy of following this

Now if we have these overhead expenses and we are going

22

to say it should not be apportioned on a regular unit basis

23

between all given bodies of traffic, we are going to find out

24

that sooner or later the railroads are not being able to recoup

25

these overhead^ expenses from any part of traffic.
-

28

-

1

So as a policy matter, the Commission has said here

2

fully distributed costs meaning "apportionment of all overhead

3

burdens" must be divided and the parts will be divided here in

4

accordance that this north-south group traffic bears to the

5

railroads.

(5

Q

I will make the suggestion to you that the basic probl

here

3

sion said we are going to review these divisions on the basis of j

as I understand it, arises from the fact that the Commis-

]

9

comparative costs, isn't that right?

10

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

11

Q

That other factor is costs, not what the railroads

12

need, but. costs.

13

have a duty, if any standards are to be applicable here, to show

14

that it was an applied cost standard, namely, that it has ascer­

13

tained costs under some proper sensible basis.

16

Then the Commission, I should think, would

I am very much in favor of latitude to the ICC and

17

its terrible jobs as I have expressed at various times, but therc-

10

have to be some standards here and instead of that, what the ICC

19

did hear was to take a gross figure, costs of the total operatior

20

including some other elements and off-hand they are rather sur­

21

prising, such as computer charges and the unsegregated car char­

22

ges, whatever that all means.

23

Then you have arrived at your conclusion on that basis.

24

That is what is bothersome here and it is not because you could

25

not make a further refinement of these costs, is it?
-

29

-

O

1

A

Your Honor, the refinements we made were based on the

Rail Form A computations, and based on the fact that parties who

seek to show that there are differences in one given body of

traffic as compared to average traffic were shown here.

5

mission reviewed the attempts by the Southern lines to show these:

8

bodies of traffic distinguishing from average traffic and they

The Com­

I did want to cover quickly the points of the Southern
Governors Conference.

They paralleled the arguments of the

10

Southern lines, but they claim as a matter of law that even if

11

the Northern lines experience higher costs of service, the Com­

12

mission must find that such higher costs reflect inherent terri­

13

torial disadvantages before.

14

This contention is based on. the premise that the Com­

15

mission made no adequate finding to dispose of their claim and

16

therefore its order is going to produce dire consequences upon

17

the economy of the South and effectively nullify the present and

18

future economic gains that the South was scheduled to receive by

19

virtue of the New York Case.
We ask the Court only to consider the findings that

the Commission did make in response to each one of these conten­

tions.

why the Commission could not accept them were clearly expressed

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL E. SANDERS

3

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

4

MR. SANDERS:

May it please the Court, my name is Carl

5

Sanders.

6

represent the Southeastern Association of Railroad and Utility

7

Commissions.

8
9

I represent the Southern Governors Conference.

I also

I come to the Court with a little different view of
what this case is all about.

Of course, we have been in this

10

case since the very beginning and we have had to listen to the

1?

arguments between the Northern and Southern railroads, and we

12

have heard all of this evidence about the question of costs.

13

we contend and we respectfully insist today that this is not just,

14

a private dispute over revenue between Northern and Southern

15

railroads, but that this case involved a much bigger question

16

than that.

,

17

Bui.

This case really involves the fact that the Commission

10

has abandoned the territorial relationship of equality between

19

the North and the South,

20

tion and whatsoever so far as we have been able to ascertain.

They have done this without any explan<

21

Q

Equality in what?

22

A

Equality that there are differences.

This Court in

23

1947 in New York v. The United States determined that there were

24

no differences between the official territory of the North and

25

the Southern territory and by virtue of that, you established
31

-

-

1

the uniformity of rates and then subsequent to that, uniformity

2

of divisions.

3

We have been in this case and it has been our observa­

4

tion that there has been no determination or no adequate reasons

5

given why the decision in the Mew York v„ The United States Case

6

is not just as sound today as it was in 1947 and that this busi­

7

ness about it costing more money to run the railroads in the Mori .h,

8

as compared with running a railroad in the South, is not based

9

on any inherent difference which is the words that this Court

1©

used whan it became necessary to adjust divisions or adjust rates

11

that there should be some inherent difference.

12

So you put us on an equal basis and we have been on

13

that equal basis and we see no reason under the evidence that was

14

submitted before the Commission, to change this basis and give

15

the North now a preference in divisions for operating railroads

16

in the North when they have not proven to anybody's satisfaction

17

that it costs any more money to operate a railroad in the North

18

than it does in. the South today.
If Your Honor please, of course,

19

this is an inflation

20

matter.

What it amounts to is this, it amounts to the fact that

21

under this order of the Commission they are going to give them

22

an average of 17 percent or up to a maximum of 34 percent more

23

for carrying the same amount of freight over the same distanct

24

in the North, as it relates to the South, and that is what it

25

amounts to.
-

32

-

Q

i

2

I understood that the net average change in the divi­

sions was 3 percent?

3

A

That is the net average change in the amount of money

4

it would cost the Southern railroads, I think that is what Mr.

5

Kaier said.

6

this case is an average of 17 percent more to the Northern railroad

7

for carrying.

8
9

But the division preference that they are giving in

If you have a haul of 50 miles in the North and we have
an identical haul of 50 miles in the South, they are going to

10

give them an average of 17 percent more in the North for carrying

11

that same amount of traffic over that same distance as we would

12

get for carrying the same amount of traffic over the same distance

13

in the South, and it does go as high as 34 percent in the x’ecord,
So this is not something new.

14
15

Q

Now tell me what is the 3 percent?

1G

A

The 3 percent they are talking about is the amount of

17

money that is going to take away from the Southern railroads'

18

operating revenues, I believe is the direct interpretation of

19

that.

The

“Other factors being

equal., the cost differences between the North and the South are

the product of and reflect inherent advantages and disadvantages

12

in the two territories,"
Wow this is what they said.

13

We contended, of course—

54

Q

Which one did they claim had the most disadvantages?

13

A

They claim that the North has the greatest disadvant­

18

age , may it please Mr. Justice.

17

Q

What is that disadvantage?

18

A

The only disadvantage that we can ascertain from this

19

record is, (1) perhaps an over-capacity of railroad facility in

£0

the North.

21

operating a railroad in the North today as compared with operat­

22

ing one in the South, from this record it would be because they

23

have more capacity in the North than wa have in the South.

We think if there is any cost difference between

Q

You mean the competition is keener?

23

A

No, sir, I mean back in the day and times when the
-

34

-

1

Northern railroad system was first built, to be perfectly candid

2

about it, all the industry in this country was located in the

3

Northern part, of the country.

4

was a great, deal of railroads that were built.

5

At that time, of course, there

Since that time, of course, much of the industry in

6

this country, some of it, thank goodness, has come to the South.

7

Now the fact that we do have industry in the South, we have an

0

over-capacity of railroads in the North and so they say, well,

9

as a result of that they have maybe more wages, they have perhaps;

10

some of these transitory costs that are attendant to operating

11

an oversized railroad.

12

Now since that time, since this decision, and they

13

recognize this in the Commission but they didn't do anything

14

about it, they said we raise the question what is going to happen

15

when they have these mergers?

16

we can't consider that other than to recognize there will be

17

mergers.

They said we can't go into mergers,

Since that time in the Penn-Central Merger Case the

18

19

Commission found that the Penn-Central merger would save $80 mil­

£0

lion a year and yet there is not any recognition given whatsoever

21

in this proceeding for these savings that are taking place in th<

22

North.

23

Mr. Justice Douglas, in his opinion in New York v. The

24

United States said that of all the things we don't want to happen

25

is we don't want to create a man-made trade barrier and we are
-35

1

going to have a man-made trade barrier as the rate structure thei\

2

existed and so we are going to equalise the rates and at the

3

same time equalize the divisions.

4

are asking this Court to do now in a subtle fashion is to reim­

pose in another manner this same manmade trade barrier between

6

the North and the South, except in doing it through the struetur?

20

Southern rating back up and we have a rate in the South greater

21

than in the North; or if we don't raise the rate in the South,

22

we are going to have to reduce the service, and that means

get in the North, instead of being able to buy, say, with the

Q

But if this Commission order is allowed to stand, that

What percentage of the total revenues of the Southern

railroads are we talking about here?

7

A

We are talking about 3 percent, I believe.

G

Q

No, I mean overall, how much of the revenues?

9
10

What

percentage of the total revenues does the Southern division
derive from these --

11

A

12

Q

20 percent.
The next thing I am going to ask you is this.

As I

13

understand what you are seeking is a fairness of the District

14

Court order?

15

A

16

Q

Yes, sir, I sure am.
The question before us is whether or not we will affirn

17

this District Court order or not, whether we like what happened

18

or not?

19

A

Yes.

If it please Mr. Justice Fortas, I think if the

20

Court will affirm the other point I am seeking, and I want to

21

conclude my argument, if this Court will affirm the District

22

Judge's decision, all we want and all we have ever asked for and

23

we have raised the question at every level from the beginning up

24

is to ask the Commission to go into all of the economic facets

25

and all of the economic factors in the Northern territory and in
-

37

-

1

the South and if they go into all of those factors, which they die;,

1

not do in this case, then we are perfectly willing to stand by

3

whatever the decision might be.

4

Q

Provided it comes out right?

S

A

We believe it will come out right.

The other point I

6

want to make before I sit down, if I might, the other thing the

1

Commission is doing in this case that I think is very significant

8

is that for 30-odd years they have followed the principle of

9

primary local responsibility and that is that the territory where

m

the cost factors are involved should bear the costs of that ter­

11

ritory, not superimpose itself on sortie other territory.
What they are asking us to do in the South is subsi­

12
13

dize Northern railroads.
I have one other factor and I will sit down, these com­

muter deficits.

know we have to come to grips with that problem and we don’t

think that we should have to subsidize the commuter deficits in

5

the North and at the same time come to grips with the problem

ourselves in the South and pay that ourselves.

7

In conclusion, we simply feel this way.

We want equal

We want a free

We think we

10

are entitled to equality, of equal treatment with any other sec­

than that, we think that the Commission should at least give us

13

some explanation why we are going to have to be relegated to a

second-class status,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD J. TRIENENS
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

MR. TRIENENS:

the Southern railroads.

I am Howard J. Trienens.

I represent
*■

20

When we started out this case, we were equal partners

21

with the Northern railroads and we were divided on a uniform and

22

equal basis of rates.

23

case has changed that relationship.

24
25

As Governor Sanders has pointed out, this

We are now unequal.

This case was tried on the express

request of the Northern railroads that they were seeking a

disproportionate system of a. uniform, structure of rates.

2

wanted a disproportionate share and they got it, for performing

3

exactly the same service on the same cars moving between the ter­

S

I will show where that came from and why that is not
supported by any evidence.

C

Q

You mean per mile?

9

A

Yes, sir, 300 miles in the South, same car, 300 miles

10

in the North, they get 17 percent more compensation for doing

11

that same work on that same car under this order.

12

Q

You say before the Commission acted it was equal?

13

A

50-50, when we each performed half the service with

14

an equal haul, we were splitting it equally on a uniform system

15

of rates.

16

Q

Do you on your side of the case question the principle

17

that if it were shown that the costs to the Northern roads in

18

handling this class of traffic were more than the Southern costs

19

would you question the division based on that?

20

j,

A

We would not question it unless they carried through ar{,d

21

did two more things„

First, found that these differences in

22

costs were inherent, inherent in the difficulty of the territory,

23

they could not cure it by consolidations, they could not cure it

24

by becoming more modern, they could not cure it, it was inherent.

25

If this was an inherent difference like they had a mountain to

Q

You mean necessary?

3

A

That’s right, a necessary difference in the costs, not

4

that they just happened to spend more money,

5

Q

Or do you mean they had to make an efficiency?

6

A

Efficiency in this case is a slippery word.

We found

7

they were operating the systems as they then existed equally.

S

But they merged Perm and Central and New Haven to create effi­

9

ciencies that these railroad managements could not achieve by

10

themselves.

11

This situation of unequality puts the South in a uniquely

12

different position.

the rates are uniform.

14

and the Southwest, the divisions relate to the rates and they are

uniform.

So where did this .inflation come from?

Here's where it came from.

It came from a handful of

14

items, commuter deficits, border points interchange, car costs,

15

empty return ratios and just a handful of items we discussed in

16

our briefs.

17

that the costs for some items are higher in the North.

After

It is a highly indus­

Of course, they have a lot of commuter service and the

21

South has none.

That hasn't anything to do with north-south

22

freight traffic and, indeed, the Commission found as a finding

23

of fact that many items, many items of suburban service are

24

solely related to suburban service, meaning a finding that these

25

costs have not anything to do with north-south freight traffic.

9

A

The Commission has in the past.

I can't look behind,

10

but it has in the past said that it did consider deficits from

11

passenger service.

12

deficits as a separate problem, which should not be dealt with

13

by the freight shippers subsidizing the service, but rather

14

should be dealt with by the local community.

In fixing the freight rates?

21

A

Yes.

22

Q

But here your point is that they have, considered defi­

cits on commuter service in fixing these divisions?
A

That's right, and I want to draw another line here,

because in these rate cases the reason they consider passenger
-

43

-

1

deficit at all was to meet the revenue needs of these carriers,

%

they needed more money so they raised the rates to give them

this money, and they took into consideration passenger deficit»

Let me see if I can be precise about this.

If I

10

correctly understand your last statement, you are telling us thai

'21

the Commission has not used the costs of passenger service,

12

intercity passenger service except for the cost of common facili­

13

ties for the purpose of arriving at costs for purposes of fixing

14

freight rates?

15

A

Not quite, sir, not quite.

16

Q

Let me hear you state it.

17

A

They picked as their standard of this whole case the

13

cost of north-south freight traffic.

They further found that

Q

I know that as to this case now.

21

A

In this case they nevertheless went in and put the

22
.23

whole passenger deficit into this cost.
Q

I understand as to this case, but I am asking you

24

generally when the Commission figures costs for purposes of a

25

freight rate case, not a division case, does the Commission take
-

44

-

1

2
O

<J

into account the costs of passenger service or does it not?
A

I can't answer that. Your Honor, and the reason I can’i

is that in the early ’50‘s they did say they would reflect the

4

passenger deficits in a rate increase in 1959, they went to Con­

5

gress and said as to commuter deficit, it should not be subsi­

G

dised by freight shippers and they have acted consistent with the

7

since that time.

0

There were no freight rate increases from about '59 to

9

'67 and in the latest decision I just can't answer your question

10

I just don't know.

11

this, and this bears on the argument that we have to use Form A

12

costs in these averages because it is essential to our rate

13

cases.

14

I do know in their last decision they said

In that case they had, among other freight commodities

15

not merely citrus fruit, but all perishables from North and

16

South, territory-wide, and somebody put in Rail Form A unadjusted

17

costs with respect to these rates, and the Commission said,

18

ritorial average costs are entitled to little weight in determin­

19

ing the costs of handling particular movements."

'‘Ter ­

So the idea that anything you do here about Rail Form

20
21

A is going to embarrass them at all in their administration of

22

rate cases is out by their own statement.

23
24
25

Q

When the Commission has been referring to costs, has

it been out-of-pocket costs?
A

No, sir.
-

45

-

1

Q

What does it include, the value of the property?

2

A

The full costs of performing this north-south service,

3

it would include a return on the value of the property, for

4

example, a return on the value of the car used to haul this

5

traffic, that's right, sir, all the full costs of handling this

8

north-south traffic.
That is what I understood the Commission to mean and

1

I don't quarrel with it.
Q

If you have a shipment of oranges from Florida, as

10

they are going through the South, those railroads will get 17.5

We will use the territorial

higher in the North.

through an interchange to the North, the same car, there is no

rational explanation or effort to explain why for that car it

could be 32 percent higher in the North.

7

That is the whole question here.

We are talking about

north-south freight traffic.

The question is whether there is

any evidence to support these higher costs for the items where

court had somehow immunized from judicial review cost findings

in anything as complicated as a railroad division's case in

citing the so-called Transcontinental case of two terras ago.

10

That just is not so.
At the time that case was tried there were common

issues.

The East was involved in that case when the Trans­

13

continental case was first brought.

14

some of these car costs, and other issues were involved.

Commuter never was.

There were complications,

Now, in the Transcontinental case this court noted

13

in an argument in which the western railroads were urging

14

their passenger deficits be reflected — the court said:

15

"While the Commission has sometimes acted to offset passenger

16

deficits in freight rate cases, the issues are quite different

17

when in a division's case it is argued that carriers in one

18

part of the country should subsidize passenger operations of

19

carriers elsewhere»"

The court did not get into this matter in that case
