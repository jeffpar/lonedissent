MR» CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. HAFT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

Mr» Haft.

MR» HAFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court,j

this matter is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the
10

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

11

offenses on the possession of one-half ounce of marihuana.

12

first offense was a conviction under the Marihuana Tax Act? the

13

second was a conviction tinder the Importation Statute

14

Section 176(a) of Title 21.

15

It involves two
The

The two questions presented to the Court are, first,

16

whether the Fifth Amendment privilege is a defense for a prose- ■

17

cution under the Marihuana Tax Act, and the second question is

18

the constitutionality under the due-process clause of the pre­

1

sumption in the importation statute which presumes importation

20

in fact of marihuana and knowledge in fact by the defendant of

21

such illegal importation, both inferences flowing from mere

22

possession alone.

23

The facts in the case are simple.

The petitioner had

24

an automobile trip from New York to Laredo, Texas, he tried to

25

enter Mexico, was denied entry, came back to Laredo and was
2

searched thoroughly at Customs and the less than half ounce was
2

found.

3
4

At the trial petitioner took the stand and admitted
acquisition of the marihuana in New York,

5

On the first issue — that is, whether the Fifth

0

Amendment privilege is available as a defense to a Marihuana

7

Tar Act prosecution — 1 think the Court's language in the

8

Grosso case is particularly appropriate? that is, the hazards

9

of incrimination ought to be measured by literal and full com­

10

pliance with all the statutory requirements.
The Government has no argument on that.

11

They simply

12

say that literal and full compliance with the statute is quite

13

simple.

14

prepay the marihuana tax, cannot obtain a form from the Secre­

15

tary of the Treasury, and therefore is absolutely prohibited

n

from obtaining marihuana.

17

there are no hazards of incrimination under this statute? you

IS

just cannot acquire marihuana.

A proposed illegal possessor of marihuana cannot pay,

And hence, argues the Government,

19

The petitioner's position is, the plain, meaning of the

20

Act, the legislative history of the Act, and, in fact, the Gov­

21

ernment's position in a case before this court, are completely

22

clear.

23

A brief review of the statutory scheme will be helpfulJ

Against this very clear statutory requirement impel­

17

ling incrimination, it seems to me we have to deal with the

18

Governmentas position.

The Government's position is that they

19

have had a policy since the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in

20

1937 of construing that Act in pari materia with the 1914

21

22
23
24
25

Harrison Antinarcotic Act.
Under the Harrison Act, it expressly states that only
registered persons, persons who have paid the occupational tax,
can obtain an order form.

It is expressly in the statute.

The Marihuana Tax Act, on the other hand, clearly
-

states the contrary? it says that every person,, whether or not

Cjs

registered and whether or not he has paid the special tax, must

obtain an order form prior to the acquisition of marihuana.

S

Q

Under the Harrison Act, assume you transfer with­

out an order form.

A

Under the Harrison Act, it is a crime as well.

7

Q

Is there a special tax there on illegal transfer?

3

A

0

Ho, but I think the pattern is very clear here

under the Harrison

Act.

Since it permits only lawful transfers,

10

the tax is very low.

templates only legal transfers.

It is one cent per ounce, because it con­

Is there a tax for illegal transfers?
Ho.

It is one cent because everything under that

14

Act is only

legal. Under the Marihuana Tax Act, there is a very

15

clear distinction:

and $100 an ounce for illegal ones, but transfer permitted in

Q

It has been civilly.

Do people who are convicted under this Act for

illegal transfers then have to pay the tax?
A

They have a civil liability to pay it.

There

have been civil proceedings independent of criminal proceedings;
the United States against Sanchez before this court raised that

il

question.

V

The legislative history of the Marihuana Tax Act

ia3

3

clears this point up very clearly, that everybody was intended

4

clearly under that Act to be able to receive marihuana under a

5

transfer order form»
Clinton M. Hester, Assistant General Counsel to the

6

Treasury, testified before both the House and Senate committees

Under the Harrison Act, only

analogy was brought out by the Treasury sponsor -- just like the
National Firearms Act, this Act, Marihuana Tax Act, would per­

5

mit transfer of marihuana to anyone but, of course, upon the

6

payment of a heavy tax?as in the National Firearms Act, anybody

7

could get a submachine gun.

8

And in that very same legislative history, Clinton

9

Hester stated and spelled it out exactly, a person who wants

20

marihuana would go to the Collector, pay his hundred dollars,

21

fill out the order form and give that to the transfer order;

22
23

25

The document itself, totally inconsistent with this
new argument, I think highly imaginative one, in order to meet
the Haynes, Grosso, Marchetti cases, completely inconsistent

with this, the United States against Sanchez before this court,

2

in their brief, the Government said that the Marihuana Tax Act

3

does not constitute a complete prohibition upon acquisition of

4

marihuana by unregistered persons; that instead of doing that,

5

Congress chose to levy a hundred--dollar-per-oun.ce tax.

I think that the hazards of incrimination under my

interpretation, which, I think, is the clear statutory, plain

14

meaning of the Act, plus the legislative history -- I think the

hazards are very clean Congress has created a special category,

Now you are going to have a possessor whose possession

21

is unlawful under virtually the laws of every State, go to the

22

Secretary of the Treasury, tender $100-an-ounce tax, fill out an

order form with his name, address, quantities he proposes to

24

get, and who is going to transfer to him.

25

That, I submit, is submitting the jail key at the time
7

1

and I think it is clear that the hazards are blatant.

2

Now, the Government, I think, also in recognition of

3

the clear force of this argument, has said in many places in

4

their brief, "Well, the petitioner is some sort of fellow who

Now, as I read the next

18

excerpt, I think it is clear

19.

that "permission" in this context, the petitioner meant "apply­

20

ing for registration," which is very clear is applicable only to

21

lav/ful possessors? there is no difference between the Government

22

and

16
17

Q

Was this case tried after Marchetti and Grosso

, were decided?
A

No? the case was tried before.

The verdict was

18

handed down by the jury before Marchetti, Haynes, and Grosso

19

and about 10 days before the court granted certiorari in the

20

Costello case, which first gave a hint that this issue would

21

22
23
24
25

come before the court.
The last point

on the self-incrimination issue:

We

believe that if we are right on this point, that you must
reverse on the importation count as well? whether we are cor­
rect or not on the presumption point, but that count has to be
-

9

-

I
i

.

reversed also because of the trial judge's instructions in this
case .
On the presumption issue, he charges the statutory
presumption, that the jury may convict, unless the defendant
explains his possession to the satisfaction of the jury.
judge added to that; he said;

The

By that, I mean unless the

defendant explains that his possession was a lawful and legiti­
mate possession.
Immediately thereafter, the trial judge charged that
a failure to pay the tax, marihuana tax, the failure to produce j
the order form on demand, rendered the transaction illegitimate
so the jury was in a clear position, in fact it was suggested,

j

that they find the possession illegitimate on the importation

j

count based on the failure to pay the fax or produce the order

3

form.
The second issue before the Court is the validity of
the statutory presumption, in 176(a) under the due-process
clause.

Now, the statute itself, 176(a), is very narrow.

It is

that anyone who ever, knowingly, with intent to defraud the
United States, in any manner facilitates the transportation of
marihuana, after the same has been imported, and knowing that
the marihuana has been imported, is guilty of a crime.
Q

Would that fraud be referring to defrauding him

A

Yes, sir, I believe that is what "intent to

from tax?

10

1

defraud the United States" means, because another part of the

2

statute says marihuana which should have been invoiced — mean­

3

ing it should have import duty or levy placed on it at the time

4

of importation»

3

Now, these narrow statutory elements are swept away

6

by the presumption which just says that mere possession is

7

presumptive evidence of guilt, unless

a

his possession to the satisfaction of the jury»

9

the defendant explains

Now, it is our position that that presumption is not

10

rational, it does not comport with common experience.

That offer

Mow, my position is that whether marihuana is imported

18

in fact, is an arguable proposition, but that whether the

19

defendant in fact knew of the illegal importation, the presump­

20

tion he in fact knew in any particular case, is an irrational

21

presumption# and that in either event, applying the standard of

22

reasonable doubt, as is required in a criminal case, is, at

23

best, an arguably rational proposition and is one that ought to

24

foe condemned by this court.

25

In the reply brief in this matter,

5

ings which I think are important here.

court and there is no use citing another precedent on that.

investigation is impossible.
Most importantly, the judge found that common experi­
ence, if anything,

tends to suggest that most people, if not

all, are under the belief that marihuana is grown domestically
and that that, explains its widespread domestic use.
In this regard, the judge relied upon what he con­
sidered the stuff of common experience, everyday newspaper plus
what Federal and State enforcement officials themselves were
saying about this problem.
And the strongest argument, it seems to me,' on the
extensiveness of the domestic growth -- the judge found it was

year after year the enforcement

1

very, very substantial -- was:

2

officials point out that this is a vital problem, a. prevalent

problem, and they proudly report the vast acreages destroyed in

the United States, and the next year the Bureau of Narcotics

reports another vast amount of acreage that

The judge referred to his reading of the everyday

newspaper, and he said in one unsensational newspaper, he

1!

found five accounts in three months.

12

paper was The New York Times, and one of the articles that he

13

cited was on page 1 of The New York Times on August 21, 1968.

14

It is cited in his opinion.

That one growth was enough to supply one cigarette to every one
of the 17 million school students in the country, in that one
area.
In some areas, marihuana is so thick that a truckload
can be gathered very quickly.

grow along the Susquehanna railroad tracks that parallel Route 1
along the North Bergen segment of the meadow.

At that time, they had Commissioner Anslinger's testimony that

3

90 percent of seizures in the United States came from Mexico*

4

The other testimony was of Texas and border enforcement official

5

which is by no means representative of the country*

6

Taking just the acreage destroyed by the Bureau of

7

Narcotics in 1965, the last figures that the Bureau itself

8

recorded, which is on page 17 of their annual report for that

9

year, were 1900 acres destroyed*

would have produced 2 billion marihuana cigarettes, or 10 for

14

every person in the United States.
Marihuana does pass through many hands from the source

to the smoker, and I think that is important, too, in the test­

17

ing whether or not a defendant should be held to know or could

know the basic source.

This is the kind of thing which is just

20

Q

I missed the statement you just. made.

21

A

1 said that marihuana, in the traffic, passes

22

through many hands from the original source, from the grower to

23

the smoker.

and telling the defendant, or the one who is caught in posses­

25

sion,

There may be 20 or 30 middlemen in the transaction,

"Now, it is up to you to explain this”or that "You should

5

*

know; it is rational to assume that you should know whether it

2

is imported or domestic,” I say, is irrational; I say, because

3

this is a criminal presumption we are talking about, applicable

4

to a criminal case, the stand or reasonable doubt ought to apply

5

here; and that you are telling a jury, when you permit this kind

6

of presumption that this probability that a defendant knew that

7

a given quantity of marihuana was imported, we are telling the

8

jury, when we use that presumption, that the probability is far

9

in excess of 50-50.
Q

10

As I read the Opinion, he does not say this is

11

completely invalid.

12

it may be the subject of appropriate discussion.
h

13

He just says it has to be supplemented and.

That is correct.

I do agree.

I do agree also

14

with the point he makes that this kind of presumption creates a

15

very unfair situation bevause the defendant is in a position

16

inhere it is impossible for him to defend because he cannot

17

defend on lack of knowledge of importation.

18

and try and prove the source of this through this long change

19

of title.

20

He cannot go back

It is quite different from the illegal-still case

21

where a defendant ought to be in a position to explain why he is

22

20 feet way out some place where it is dark, why is he there

23

that night; that he can explain, but he does not have the

24

ability to prove whether that marihuana was, in fact, imported.

25

Q

Of course, the difficulty in this case, if I
15

<f

understand the record, is that, according to the defendant’s

2

own testimony, he did import this marihuana from Mexico to the

3

United States»

4

went to Mexico, and it stayed there when he came back; so, in

5

this case, there is no question of it being imported, is there?

6

A

He had it in his pocket, so he said, when he

Yes, sir, there is, because the trial judge with­

7

drew the first count, which was a smuggling count, on the theory

3

that there could not be a smuggling into or importation into

3

the United States on these facts, because he had admitted acqui­

to

sition of it in New York, had practically not crossed into

II

Mexico,

12

Q

Practically not, but he had gone to Mexico.

13

A

You also had the entire issues of fact on whether

14

he knew on the way back over the bridge whether the marihuana

15

had been thrown out of the car or not.

16

Q

But it was not, and according to his own testi­

17

mony, as I understand it, the marihuana that was found was taken

18

on this trip across the bridge and then back across the bridge,

19

first to Mexico and then back into the State of Texas in the

20

United States.

21

A

That is correct.

But there were issues raised,

because his daughter had had the marihuana, he told her to get

rid of it; as they were over the bridge practically at Customs

station, she told him she had it.

of the transportation from New York down?

Exactly.

The Government, in their brief, says

10

there is this alternative theory.

Now, there is no question

that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming on the trip —

side — that is, New York down to Texas as coupled with the

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOHN S. MARTIN, JR*
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MARTIN:

Mr* Chief Justice, Kay it please the

Court, I would like to address myself first to the question con­
cerning the validity of presumption to which counsel has just
addressed himself, since that is a question peculiar to this
case and is not related to the immediately following case,
United States versus Covington, which also raises the second
issue in this case, as to the validity of the Marihuana Tax Act,
Section 176(a) of Title 21 provides, basically, anyone
who imports or receives, conceals, or facilitates the transporta
tion, consumption, or sale of illegally imported marihuana,
knowing it is illegally imported, shall be guilty of a Federal
crime,.
That statute also contains a presumption written into
the statute by Congress, and that presumption in the statute
appears at page 44(a) of the appendix.

It provides that when­

ever on trial for a violation of this subsection, the defendant
is shown to have or to have had the marihuana in his possession,
such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize
conviction, unless the defendant explains his possession to the
satisfaction of the jury.
It is the Government’s position in this case that that
statutory presumption is valid.
At the outset, I think I should make clear there does

The presumption really carries with

Do you think that the Tot rule is really the

7

equivalent, to a no-evidence rule, that one fact just is not

A

9

No, I think it is not that.

I think the Tot rule

10

is that there are certain facts that give rise to legitimate

11

inferences.

12

Q

And other facts that don’t?

Will not support certain inferences.

Clearly

this is the ruling in Tot itself; the fact that a man had been

not support an inference that the gun had been transported in

interstate commerce.

He

did give an explanation of that fact, which relates to the
nature of Mexican marihuana as opposed to that which can be
grown domestically.

Ee said because of the longer growing

season in Mexico, the Mexican marihuana has a higher alcoholic
content, and this is what produces the ‘'high.”

This is what

the marihuana smoker is looking for in marihuana.
Q

That is contrary to what we just heard.

Your

adversary said you could not tell by analysis of the marihuana
whether it was domestic or imported, unless I misunderstood him.
A

Well, I think it is probably true, Mr. Justice,

that if you were

to take marihuana and carefully cultivate it

here, perhaps in a hothouse or by some artificial means you
22

could produce from domestic

marihuana

a strain that would be

as potent as that which normally comes in from Mexico.

But 1

think the fact of experience is that marihuana which is just
growing wild does not have anywhere near that potency.

It is

for that reason, that the marihuana smoker seeks out and
attempts to get imported marihuana.
If the Court please, it is for this reason, it is
because the Mexican marihuana is a better form of marihuana,
that we submit it is reasonable to assume that people in posses­
sion of marihuana will know its source.
I think that if there is a weakness in judge Frankel's
opinion — with all due respect, I say there is — it is that
Judge Frankel, in determining whether or not the presumption of

How d© you know?
A

I certainly don't know.

The only statistics that

18

I think are somewhat persuasive, Mr. Justice Marshall, are

19

those which appear on page 40 of our brief, in the footnote,

20

which has to do with the amount of seizures of marihuana that

21

are taking place on our borders over the last eight years.

22

What I am trying to emphasize here is:

If you look

23

at those statistics, you will see that in 1962 we seized at the

24

borders approximately 1,000 kilograms of marihuana; in 1967 we

25

seised at the borders 23,426 kilograms of marihuana.
24

I think

i

that escalating amount of importation — all this reflects is;

2

the importation of marihuana is increasing in this country.

3

And 1 think this fact supports the view that there is continuing

4

in this country the desire for Mexican marihuana.

3

Q

There are other explanations of those figures;

6

that is, this may be not an increase in importation but an

7

increase in seizures.

S

in total consumption., in terms of percentage, which is what we

are talking about here, what the percentage of marihuana is

that is possessed in this country and how it is broken down,

what percentage is attributable to imported or domestically

grown marihuana.

He could do what the defendant did in Adams

among other things, challenging the trial.

There is also pos­

sibility of other evidence to be presented on that.

I think

what we are dealing with is not a peculiar case but generality
case where Congress determined this presumption should apply.
It may be the man just wandered onto the site of the
stilly but the court said it was rational to allow the presump­
tion? or maybe the man found the car over the border, he did
not steal the car, maybe he was just tired and sat down in it;
but here, it is the rationale of the presumption.
Q

Would it make any difference?

A

X think that has some bearing

Q

The question is;

Can the Government, in just

proving that he has possession, not proving the relationship to
any growth in this country of marihuana, can that prove it was
not imported?
A

It is our submission that the statute, in view

of the fact we know about the illicit marihuana traffic, makes
that a reasonable presumption.
