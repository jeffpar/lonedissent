Mr. Gray, you may proceed with.your argument.

ARGUMENT OF JON F. GRAY, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. GRAY:

7
8

No. 841, Tommie E. L.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
The petitioner below has been completely barred from

9
10

his statutory right to appeal the criminal conviction against

11

hirn and this bar has been solely upon the basis of

his poverty.

We, therefore, contend that the case before Your

12
13

Honors today is on all fours where even a stronger case than

14

that presented to this Court, in the case of Griffin versus

15

Illinois and the following cases in which this Court has held

16

for a decade that the State may not withdraw a right of appeal

17
18

from a person upon any invidious discrimination, such as
poverty.
The respondents raise two points.

19

Their first

20

point is that there is some adequate alternative method of

21

appeal open to us and the second point is that the Griffin

22

rule should not apply since the offense convicted in this

23

case and appealed from is a petty offense with which we

24
25

disagree.
In Oklahoma, as was the situation in Illinois at the
3

1

time of the Griffin ease, there are two methods of appeal.

2

There is a short form of appeal, which is the

3

clerk’s transcript and contains barely

4

record.

the few papers of

It is conceded in respondents' brief at Page 8, and
that this method of appeal

7

The second method of appeal available in Oklahoma is

8

the long form which we call a case-made, and which respondents

0

agree in their brief at Page 4 is the method in which the

60

court reporter's transcript of all of the evidence and

11

proceedings and all the instruments are made up and presented

12

to the appellate court.

all the

13

Now, turning to their first point that there is an

14

adequate alternative method, the respondents assert that the

15

defendant should have made up a statement of the evidence from

16

memory in narrative form and submitted it, and I quote from

17

Page 8 of their brief,"in lieu of the case-made" and that, there

18

fore, we would have an alternative method of appeal.

19

Q

Just where did that word "case-made" come from?

20

A

Your Honor, the statutes, as far as I can tell,

21

states that the parties shall make up a case and I think that

22

is where it comes from.

23
24

Q

Which statute?

brief and -A

Q

“Case-Made in Criminal Cases".

A

Now, the facts of this case which we say brings

this case within Griffin rule is that the defendant, who has
conceded in this case of being indigant.

He was a hospital

janitor making about $55 a week and supporting living children.
The defendant was convicted in the Municipal Court of Oklahoma
City after a trial -- and this is important — a trial by a
12-man jury, was convicted of the crime of driving — and this
is also critical ■— driving under the influence, not drunk­
driving because everybody knows what drunk-driving is, But
driving under the influence.
He was sentenced to serve 90 days in jail and pay a
fine of $50 under a statute in which the maximum sentence is
■*r

90 days in jail and $100.
Q

Is there a distinction between drunk-driving and

driving under the influence?

the two?

A

I think it is a matter of degree, Your Honor.

Q

I know.

But is there a legal difference between

You said you know what drunk-driving is but this is
5

something different»
A

I think if he was charged with drunk-driving —

and I know of nothing on the statutes that sets out that charge
but I understand that some States have them —- that the
prosecution would have to prove that the defendant was drunk.
In this case the prosecution only has to prove that
the defendant had enough alcohol to influence his driving to
some degree which would render him incapable of safely driving,
Q

You just have this single offense in your State?

right?
A

Right.

Q

You don’t have the two.

A

No, as far as I know, there is no drunk-driving

statute in Oklahoma, just driving under the influence.
The defendant filed his motion for a new trial and
attached, thereto, the sworn affidavit that the person who
was driving the car at the time of the so-called alleged
accident, but that motion for a new trial was overruled and he
requested a case-made.
It is recognised by the trial court that the petitione r 9
in this case, would have an absolute right to appeal if he woulc
pay for the court reporter^ notes.
The respondents have attached , as an exhibit,to
their first brief in this case a transcript of the hearing
and the trial conceded this point.

Q

1

Mr. Gray, do I correctly understand that the

2

question here is not whether he has a right to appeal, that

3

he can appeal -—

4

A

5

Q

Right.
-- and on that appeal he would get the transcript

which you refer — what do you refer to it as?

6
7

A

The case-made, yes.

8

Q

No, no.

9

A

The court reporter's

10

Q

A

12

Q

13

He would get that

That is correct.
So, the only question here is, not his right of

appeal, but it is whether he can have a right, as you would put

14

it I

15

suppose, of effective appeal in the sense that he can't

obtain, without paying for it, the stenographic report of

16

what

transpired at his trial.

17

A

18

That is very well put.

It was conceded by and

expressly stated by both courts that if he had been convicted

19

of a felony in District Court he would have been given this

20

transcript without cause.

21

Now, it is interesting to note that at the hearing,

22

on our request for a court reporter's transcript, the trial

without paying for it; is that right?

court held several findings of fact which are lengthy but
'

briefly the important ones are — and it is for this reason fchai
7

1

we contended this case is stronger than Griffin — the

2

trial court held that we have the legal need for the long form

3

of appeal and that the short form is inadequate.

4

The second important point that the trial court

5

found is that our appeal is not without merit, which is similar

6

to a

Federal Court finding that the appeal is not frivolous.
The third point that strikes right at the heart of the

7

8

respondents' first contention is that the defendant -- neither

9

the defendant nor his attorney could compile from memory an

10

adequate narrative statement, an adeqixafce transcript.

I?

Q

Why not?

12

A

The trial court, Your Honor, heard the pre­

13

trial hearing and they had pre-trials in this court, and heard

14

the trial and heard our motions and our arguments and, of

15

course, taking all that into consideration, I assume, he felt

IS

it not unreasonable that we couldn't remember all the important

17

points in the case.

10

Q

How long did the trial take?

19

A

It took approximately one day.

20

Q

How short would it have to be so memory would

A

Your Honor, the only thing that I can respond

21

22
23
24
25

suffice?

to in that regard is this Court's holding in the Gardner case
j which was rendered at the time my brief was turned in so it is
not in my brief but this Court pointed out that certainly a
8

lawyer would be lost without a transcript in even preparing a
petition for review and that is the position in this Court today.
1 don't know how short a hearing would have to be —*
Q

How many witnesses were there?

A

I think there were approximately four.

Q

And it took a whole day?

A

Yes, sir? that is my memory.

Q

Don't some States have this as a regular procedure,

where the defense counsel presents a statement of the facts on
appeal and it is settled by the Court after consultation with
counsel?
A

Yes, they do, Your Honor.

We admit that

Oklahoma could establish such a procedure.
Q

You have such a procedure?

A

No, X say we admit that they could and that would

be a reasonable alternative.
Q

What do they have?

A

Your Honor, the two methods of appeal are the

clerk's transcript, which contains only the bare pleadings in
the case, the information, the minutes and the judgment and
the case-made that we have discussed.
Q

Those are the only two?

A

Yes „

Q

There is no provision at all for counsel getting

together and presenting a statement of the facts to the Court
9

1

and have it approved and used as a record on appeal?
A

There is none that 1 have found and if there is

Q

Why did the trial court make the finding that

A

Well, he —

A

What

if he could have?

10

Q

Yes.

11

A

Your Honor, I don't know.

12

Q

He could have made his case.

13

A

Well, there are many cases in Oklahoma that set

could he have done?

14

out the requirement for a pre-case-made and one of them is that

15

neither the parties nor their attorney can make up a transcript

16

from memory and we have requested that the trial court rule on

17

this issue and he did so.

10
10

He ruled that it would not be reasonable to require
us to make up a transcript from memory.

20

Q

That is a good question,

Your Honor.

Court need get to.
Q

Let us assume you thought you could remember —
10

1

you had made plenty of notes, like most lawyers do in Court and

2

you made up a running account of what happened at the trial,

3

what the testimony was, do you think that that would be accept­

4

able as a case-made in Oklahoma?

5
6

A

I tried that, Your Honor, and in a case in this

same court --

7

Q

What happened to you in the State Court?

8

A

In the State Court the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

9

Appeals ruled that the petition for Writ of Mandamus was

10

denied for the same reason that it was denied in this case and

11

because the defendant there was employed and I think there was

12

one other situation that went to his earnings.

13
14

Q

There was a question as to whether or not he

was an indigent, as I remember it.

15

A

Right.

16

Q

That is the petition for certiorari pending here.

A

Right, in other words, the Court of Criminal

17
10

19
20
21

22

23
24
25

Appeals in Oklahoma did not rule in that ease that we couldn't
have a case-made because we could remember the testimony.

I

think it is unfortunate that they didn't speak to that point.
Q

Does this all come down to this, Mr, Gray, that

you are saying to us that whatever Oklahoma might adopt in the
way of some substitute practice, the present practice permits
an appeal only on short form or on case-made.
This case is inappropriate for short form and you are
11

1

denied case-made because you can't afford to pay for the

2

transcript»

3

is unconstitutional?

Therefore, this practice, in no circumstances,

4

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

5

Q

But part of it is that you must have a transcript

6

to make a case?

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

That goes for all traffic violations?

•9

A

Well, we believe that goes for all — all we

10

are asking this Court to get to is that that goes for all serious

11

criminal convictions and I ——
Q

12

Are there any cases in Oklahoma where a trial

13

record has been made by counsel and approved by the court and

14

used by the court on appeal?

15

v A

16

Q

17

I have not seen any.
May I ask this:

This is from the Municipal

Criminal Court of Oklahoma?

10

A

Right.

19

Q

Does this mean that there always is a court

23
24
25

It is a court of record.

reporter?
A
Q

That is correct.
He is sitting there, taking down, transcribing

the evidence?
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

The statutes have

given the same court reporter to the Municipal Criminal Court
12

1

of record in Oklahoma City as they have given the District

2

Court* which is the court of general jurisdiction.

3

Q

And he or she is paid out of public funds?

4

A

That is correct.

5

Q

So* this isn’t a question of one party or the

6

other needing to arrange in advance and hire a court reporter

7

to come into the courtroom.

8

A

9

set out in our brief.

The statute on the court reporter's salary is
But briefly they are that the court

10

reporter is paid a salary and then he may charge the individual

11

appellant for copy.

12

Q

But now do you go directly up to an appellate

13

court from this municipal court or is there an appeal to the

14

District Court for de novo trial?

15
16
17
18
19

20
2'i

22
23
24
25

A

Prior to the inception of this court in 1965

the appeals of this type of case went to the District Court.
Then they instituted this court and the appeals are exactly as
in the District Court* straight to the Court of Criminal Appeals
in the State of Oklahoma.
Q

Is the trial de novo in the District Court?

A

No, Your Honor, there,is one trial in the

municipal court and then you appeal that finding to the
appellate court in the State.
So, the point I would like to make is that the
trial court has negated the first point.

13

There is no alternative

record and the only basis for their argument is the 1918 Harris

Z

case which was adopted at a time when the court reporter took

down all the

That turns to the issue of the petty offense,

Your Honor, and the short answer is, yes„
Q

You think whatever we decide here also decides

the counsel issue?
A

Yes, Your Honor,,

This is why:

8

contention is that this

9

Your Honor is well aware in this discussion of petty-serious

10
11
12
13

is a serious crime.

Because our
There are, as

crimes, there are two elements -—■
Q

What has that got to do with it in this area,

serious or petty?
A

Well, usually the past determination of whether

14

it is serious or petty has come from the type of penalty and

15

the type of crime.

16
17
18

Q

But we think it goes deeper than that.

Who has made that distinction concerning question 3

of counsel or transcript?

Who has made that distinction between

serious and petty crimes?

19

A

Most of --

20

Q

Do the States have ---

A

No, most of the cases involving petty-serious

21
22
23
24
25

distinction have been jury trial issues and I think that there
has been one or two cases involving the right to counsel?
Q

There has?

In the Federal Court?

A

I am under that impression, Your Honor.
15"

I can’t

1

cite you one right now.

2

Q

You don't mean in this Court?

3

A

No.

4

Q

I gather that this Court has refused to review

5

some instances of offenses which carry no more punishment than

S

90 days.

We have refused to review refusals to provide counsel.

7

A

I think thafcis correct, Your Honor.

8

Q

Do you think we have to reach that question?

9

A

Well, no, Your Honor, I don't.

10

Q

I wouldn't think so.

I suppose you suggest it­

11

is incongruous if

12

it wouldn't necessarily follow you are also entitled to counsel?

13

A

you prevail on the right to

transcript but

We believe that in a serious crime — that is

14

why we think the right to counsel is important.

15

a petty crime, possibly, we wouldn't have a right to counsel.

16

But it is a serious crime and since it is a serious crime, we

If this was

have a right to a fair jury trial, including the right to counsel,
a fair preliminary hearing and a fair appellate procedure.
The right to a jury trial without counsel would be
half a loaf and in this case

there have been no Oklahoma

cases cited to this Court in which the Court said that this
situation is a petty offense.
So, turning to the case of Duncan versus Louisiana,
for example, as a guide, this Court said that if we look to the
laws of the localities as a gauge of the social and ethical
16

1

judgments, we see that the crime in this case is serious for

2

the singular reason that for 50 years the State of Oklahoma

3

has given a right to a jury trial based upon due process and

4

that, in all cases in which there is any incarceration, the

5

Oklahoma courts have held that due process requires a jury

6

trial.

7

For instance-- -

Q

Even for 15 days?

9

A

Yes, sir, even for one day.

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Do you think we should have a different view

of it on counsel or transcript?
A

20
21

Haven't we held that up to six months is a petty

offense here ---

15

19

of Oklahoma Constitution?

No, sir; we concede the fact that there is some­

place a petty offense.

But this Court need not re-examine the

roots of the peety-serious offense distinction because in this
case it is a serious crime.

It is a serious crime because

Oklahoma has always construed this type of crime to be a serious
offense.

iI

1

Did that answer Your Honor's question?

2

Q

I wonder if it does.

Am I wrong about this,

3

Mr. Gray, to the extent we have dealt at all with the distinc­

4

tion between petty and serious, or petty and non-pettv, which­

5

ever way you want to put it, we have indicated, have we not,

6

that there are certain of the guaranties, notably jury trial,

7

which do not apply if the offense, however serious, carries

8

with a punishment not exceeding six months; haven’t we?

9

A

Yes, Your Honor.

In the Duncan case you imnlied

10

that if the punishment was under six months there would be no

11

right to a jury trial.

12

Q

13
14
15

16
17
10
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We think —*

But we draw the distinction on the time, or

rather length of imprisonment which the offense may carry.
A

Right.

Q

We haven't drawn the line based on whether the

offense is serious or non-serious; have we?
A

No, Your Honor, it is my reading of the cases

that the six-month line is a result of findings, as I understand
it, that under six months it is not serious and over six
months it is serious.
We will argue that there are more considerations than
the mere six-month penalty.

Your Honor knows well that there

has long been discussed that there are two elements, the length
of the penalty as well as the seriousness of the crime and in
the Oklahoma Court and other cases cited in our brief at Pages ]7
18

1

and Pages 28? for example, in 1918 Franks versus City of Muskoges.
It gets to the point that when a defendant is

2
3

convicted of an offense carrying a maximum offense of a $25

4

fine, as a maximum penalty, this Court held — the Oklahoma

5

Court held that in any, with regard to ordinance violations,

6

any crime whi'ch carries any imprisonment is an essential part

7

of the tribunal and in this case, that I am mentioning to you,

3

the defendant could be jailed for failing to pay a fine, which

9

emphasizes my point that if there is one day

10

of imprisonment

in Oklahoma, that is a serious crime.
Ex Parte Monroe, also pointed out, it is another Oklahom;

11
12

case cited in our brief, that it was never contemplated that

13

a police court, which is not a court of record, could try

14

crimes involving incarceration.
Now, there are precedents in this Court.

15

Callan

16

versus Wilson was a $25 fine and a 30-day imprisonment penalty

17

and in 1888 this Court held that was serious.

13

the District of Columbia versus Colts, the charge was reckless

19

driving, which we think to be a lesser offense, and the Court

20

held that that was

21

to the general moral sense and State cases have since continued

22
23
24
25

indictable at common law.

In the case of

Our contention is that in deciding whether a crime
is serious or not, there are other legal indicia besides length

of
Q

2

Well, now, is this a submission that on this

3

business of extension of right to counsel, if that is what it

4

is to be, the determination should be made on the basis of a

5

criterion called "seriousness of the offense" rather than

by focusing primarily on the punishment that the offense

7

carries?

8

9

Is that what you are asking?
A

We believe that the right to counsel is part of

the baggage of the jury trial.

I don't know if that answers

10

your question but I submit that the right to counsel shouldn’t

n

depend upon an arbitrary imprisonment, a time of imprisonment.

12

It should depend on whether the crime is serious or not and

13

in the past this Court has said there are two considerations.

14

We are arguing today that there are many considerations

15

about whether a crime is serious.

16

you are speaking of is extended in Oklahoma by statute and by

17

State constitution; as I mentioned, it is an essential part of

13

the jury trial and also the City of Oklahoma City has an

19

attorney — and it certainly would be a violation of due process

20

and equal protection, we contend, to try a man with a jury trial

1

A

2

Well, we are indicating that since there is a

3

right to counsel, that is another indication of the seriousness

4

of the crime.
Q

5

But you say there is a right to counsel in any

case in Oklahoma, or did I misunderstand you?

6

7

A

I think that is a correct position.

8

Q

Then, in Oklahoma, every offense is a serious

crime under that definition, even a parking violation.

9

A

10

I see what you mean, Your Honor.
I think this Court need not get to that point,

11

but I think you are right.

12
13
14
15

Q

That is where your argument leads.

A

That is correct.

Q

Mr. Gray, as I remember your brief, the points

that you rely on to show that Griffin ought to be applied in

16

this case — that is to say that the State ought to be required

17

to furnish, without cost, to an indigent such transcript as is

18

necessary for effective appeal.

19

That is what you are trying to

get us to hold, isn't it?

20
21

22

A

Yes, sir.

Q

And in order to support the argument that this

is the kind of case in that category, you point out that this

23

is a case in which the jury trial is required, that is Point 1?

24

is that

that this regarded,that driving while under the influence of

cases?

Q

Sir?

11

A

In our cases and in this Court.

Q

Then you point out that --

13

isn't there some provision in the Oklahoma constitution to

14

which you refer us with respect to the definition of a serious

15

offense?

1G

A

No, Your Honor.

The definition of a serious

17

offense, we contend, comes from the old Oklahoma cases cited

18

in our brief which construe the due process laws to mean that

Of course, this Court is a court of record and on

your question as to the right to a jury trial, our position is

7

that since we do have a right to a jury trial, that is the

indication of the seriousness of the crime.
But the other indications, which we submit that

this Court may consider, are the*. serious is a relative term and

ARGUMENT OF GILES K. RATCLIFFE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

Q

Mr. Ratcliffe.

MR. RATCLIFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, if Your Honors

please.
The respondents have urged two positions here.

One

7

isthat the Court's ruling in the Griffin case should not be

8

extended to this type case for the reason that the relief that

9

the petitioners have sought was denied by the appellate court

50

below on the grounds that this was a quasi criminal, in the

11

language of the Court, or a petty offense.

12

Now, I think this is where we got into the discussion

13

of serious offense or petty offense.

14

it had reviewed Your Honors’ decisions in these matters and

15

had found no case where this Court had said that a transcript

16

must be furnished in a case involving, what they call, a quasi

17

criminal or a petty offense.

18

The Court just said that

Now, clearly, if this were one in which a felony was

19

involved, it would not be tried in this city court.

20

this problem wouldn’t have arose.

Consequenti V'

21

Q

What is the jurisdiction of this city court?

22

A

$100 fine, 90 days maximum sentence.

23

Q

The court has no jurisdiction with anything

24
25

punishable with a more serious offense.
A

No, that is true.
