ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE R. WARREN

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

9
10

MR. WARREN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

11

This case involves the constitutionality of the

12

Arkansas Anti-Evolution Law.

13

H. H. Blanchard, the father of two would-be learners, challenged

14

the constitutionality of the initiated act No. l-F-1926, which

15

was the so-called Monkey Bill or the Anti-F.volution Law.

16

Mrs. Susan Epperson, a teacher and

The callenge was based upon the contention that the

17

act violated and colided with the first amendment freedoms, the

18

freedom of speech, the freedom to speech and to learn, and the

19

question of freedom of religion, the question of the establishmer t

20

clause of the first amendment.

21

We have briefed these points as well as we possibly

22

can.

23

excellent briefs.

24

the patience of this Court to argue to any great extent the

25

question of the first amendment freedoms, but I would like to

We have the benefit of supporting briefs of amicus to
I shall not burden or impose upon the time or

4

i

discuss with emphasis, greater emphasis, than in our brief the

2

question of failure of the Act to meet the permissible statutory!

3

vagueness of the new process clause.

4

From the time that this act was enacted or adopted,

5

teachers in Arkansas were and have been and are genuinely confuss

6

and concerned, uncertain as to whether or not the language of ths

7

act which forbids the teacher to teach the theory or doctrine

8

that man ascended or decended from a lower form of animal,

9

whether that language forbids the teacher to discuss the matter

10

or permit the theory or permit a classroom discussion of the

11

theory or whether the actual meaning of the act was that the

12

teacher could not teach, that idle theory was or had been

13

established or it was true.
At the time of the trial of this case in the lower

14
15

court, the plaintiff, Mrs. Epperson, testified that she did not

16

wish to teach, that the theory was true, but simply to explain,

17

because contained in the chapter of the biology book that had

18

been furnished hereby the local school district.
As I understand it, there simply is no biology text­

19
20

book that simply doesn't have some reference or some explanation

21

of the theory of the evolution of man .

22

Judge Reed, the trial judge, commented on the question

23

of whether or not the language of the act permitted a discussion

24

of the act or whether it forbid the teaching that the theory was

25

true.

We devoted 12 pages in our brief in the Arkansas Supreme

3

Court to a discussion of statutory vagueness under the due

2

process clatise, yet the Supreme Court of Arkansas in a two-line

3

opinion,, memorandum and opinion, held that this was a proper

4

exercise or a valid exercise, that this act was a valid

5

exercise of the power of the state to control the curriculum of

8

the schools.

7

Q

8
9

Would you be taking the first position under the

5

first amendment?
A

Yes.
Ii

10
11
12

Q

If this statute, as I read it, says that it is unlaw­

ful to teach in any university, college, normal public school

!

and so forth.

t
■:

If it is said that it is unlawful to teach

't

13

children in primary grades one through six, would you take the

14

same position under the first amendment?

15

16

A

I would take the same position, but not quite as

strongly.

17

Q

I don’t understand.

18

A

I think the Bartels and Iowa case, the Iowa case,

19

the Nebraska case, the Meyer case, that those statutes pro­

20

hibiting the teaching of German only applied to the elementary

21

schools and this court in those two cases struck down those

22

acts under the due process clause.

23

G

Those were private schools?

24

A

In the Meyer case, it was a public school.

25

Q

You are familiar, I don't know that you cited, with

6

1

the decisions in the area of the Ginsburg Case in the last term,

a

the Bumper and Michigan and in those cases, at least in that

3

area has drawn some lines depending upon the ages of the childre

4

or the activity there in volved.

5

A

Yes, Justice Brennan..

6

Q

You don8t think that same kind of language is here?

7

A

No.

I take the position that the position of the

8

public schools, even in the elementary grade is not a matter

9

for ballot, but a matter for the proper education officers.
Q

10

Suppose you had a statute that said it shall be

11

unlawful to teach in the grades one through six, that depending

12

upon the color of the skin, one race is inferior to another

13

race.

14
15

IS

Do you say that vrould be unconstitutional?
A

Yes, sir, 1 think that would clearly be unconstitu­

tional.
Q

So you donst think any lines can be drawn at all

17

depending upon the level of the education, primary versus high

13

school?

19

A

1 must say that I believe that these are matters for

20

educators and not for the ballot.

21

case was decided by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, it made the

22

statement in the second line that we do not decide whether the

23

act forbids the discussion or explanation of the theory or

,24

forbids whether the theory was true.

25

the act

But to go back, when this

This in itself condemns

7

1

It certainly makes it vague.

The teacher should not

be required particularly where this is a penal act and where

3

conviction requires the dismissal of the teacher from the school.

4

from her profession, from her job, the teacher shouldn’t be

5

required to take this gamble.

6

Q

It is also a fine?

7

A

$500 fine.

8

Q

Eas there been any prosecution under the statute?

9

A

To my knowledge, there has not been.

10

threats of prosecution.

11

I don’t think they were ever concluded.

It is evident there is not much danger in the

I can't say there

15

was any danger or not.

16

lot of fright.

17

In a number of districts in Arkansas, the subject of biology

18

is not even taught.

19

biology books do have chapters, when the teacher reaches that

20

chapter, the teacher simply skips it, unless the teacher happens

21

to be one of those ingenious people who wants to be sure that

22

the student actually reads it.

23

There was a lot of uncertainty and a

I think the act was used for mostly bogeymen.

In other districts in Arkansas, because the

The teacher announces that the reading of this chapter is

24

illegal.

I think the children probably run and read it and get

25

more from that chapter than any other chapter in the book.

Mr. Langston?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON LANGSTON

13

I

.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

14
15
16
17

MR. LANGSTON;

May it please the Court, I think it should

be noted to start off with that from the record in this case
this action was originated in 1965, prior to the administration

18

of the President and the attorney general and was defended by

19

him in the state courts.
The present administration took over the defense of

20
21

22
23
24
25

this lawsuit after it was decided by the Supreme Court of
Arkansas and was appealed to this court.
Q

What was the significance of that?

A

I was just giving you background, Your Honor.

Q

I thought you were telling us your administration

j

10

1

doesn’t like the statute»

2

A

No, I aw not here prepared to say that, Your Honor»

3

Q

It wight not be too late , you know.
,

4

A

The reason the State of Arkansas is involved in this
\

5

lawsuit, as you will recall from the record, the plaintiff

6

pursued the Little Rock School District and its superintentent.

7

The reason the State of Arkansas intervened in the lawsuit is

8

that under our declaratory judgment act under v?hich Mrs.

3

to

Epperson sought to declare this? act unconstitutional, the
statute number is 34-2510 in our code.

It is in our declaratory!

11

act or declaratory judgment of acts of statutes that when a

12

declaratory relief is sought in a procedure seeking to have any

13

state statute declared unconstitutional, the attorney general of;

14

the state shall be served with a copy of the proceeding and is

15

entitled to be heard.

16

general's office is involved in this lawsuit at this stage.

17

So that is the reason why the attorney

We have always interpreted that to mean that we are

18

to defend the constitutionality of these statutes,

19

should also be noted in the record that the Chancery Court of

20

Polasky County filed and rendered what I would call a rather

21

lengthy opinion for a trial court in Arkansas.

122

23
24
25

I think it

i

I

We have the benefit of its reasoning in this court.
However, the Supreme Court of Arkansas which ordinarily and in
almost all of its cases renders an opinion with reason to back
it up, has failed —- I shouldn’t say failed to, but has not

j
j

XX

!

filed an opinion which is usually written by one of its justices

2

with reasoning for its decision,

3

opinion in this case which they very rarely do,

4
5

They merely issued a per curia; a

1 don't know why they didn’t file a written opinion
with reasoning.

6

Q

Maybe they couldn't,

7

A

I have heard rumors to that effect.

8

Of course, the second sentence in the per curiam opinion

9

which one of the justices said he thought was irrelevant to the

10

decision of the case, if a case was brought to prosecute a

11

teacher under this action, I would say that the opinion of the

12

Supreme Court and the statute would be interpreted to mean that

13

to make a student aware of the theory, not to teach whether it

14

was true or untrue, but just to teach that there was such a

15

theory which would be the grounds for the prosecution under the

16

staitfce? and that the Sxipreme Court of Arkansas’ opinion should

17

be interpreted in that manner.

18

.Q

Should be interpreted to the effect that it is a

19

criminal offense for a teacher to make a student aware that

20

there is such a theory?

21

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

In our opinion teach means to make the student aware

23

that there is such a theory, not whether it is true or untrue.

24
25

Q

So you think we should take the Arkansas statute as

meaning that?

12

1

A

Yes, Your Honor, to mean that,

2

Q

As meaning that it doesn5fc reach the teaching about

3

as well as affirmatively teaching the rightness of it?

6

I
It would cover a teacher telling about Darwin as well j
Ij
as teaching the Darwin was right?
j
I
A
That is correct. If Mrs. Epperson would tell her

7

students that, "Here is Darwin's Theory, that man ascended or

3

descended from a lower form of being,” then I think she would

4
5

9
SO

be under this statute liable for prosecution.
Q

I have some trouble with that.

You get that out of

11

this second sentence, 5*The Court expresses no opinion under

12

the question?83

13

A

!

I am saying that I think that the lower courts of

14

Arkansas would hold that: sentence irrelevant, Your Honor, and

15

say that, although the Supreme Court of Arkansas did not.

16

think if the Supreme Court of Arkansas were presented with a

17

prosecution under this case, that they would disavow that

13

second sentence.

19

Q

I

As has already been suggested, the problem I take it

20

is to decide the constitutional question on die basis of the

21

authoritive interpretation of the statute in a state court.

:22

A

Yes, Your Honor.

23

Q

What are we to take to foe the authoritive interpre­

24
25

tation of the statute by the Supreme Court of Arkansas State?
A

I think the first, sentence of the opinion.

13

1

z
3
4
5

Q

That is that it is a valid exercise of the state’s

power to specify the curriculum in the public schools?
A

Yes, Your Honor,

They have not decided the question

that I have said.
Q

What concerns sue, going back to the question I asked

6

earlier,, are we to take this to mean that as much as they have

7

said is that this statute is valid as regards the curriculum in

8

the public schools meaning primary schools or does this mean

9

that it is valid as regards teaching in any university, college,

10

public school or other institution?

1?

A

I think any tax school in Arkansas would be covered.

12

Q

So public school here covers colleges and graduate

15
16
17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

schools?
A

Yes.

14

1

Q

If that is the interpretation that we are contesting

2

the constitutionality of the First Amendment, do you see a differ

3

3nce when that kind of prohibition dealing with the universities

4

colleges and public schools, and that kind of prohibition dealing!

5

tfith children in the primary areas?

6

A

No, sir, I don't.

7

Q

You don't think Butler in Michigan has any analogy here

8

at all?

9

tfhat is fit for children to read?

10

You can't measure the reading of it by the standards of

A

I guess what you are getting at is the impression of

I don't see any distinction in this.

I think

11

younger children.

12

that anyone from kindergarten on up is not supposed to be made

13

aware of this theory in Arkansas and that it makes no difference

14

how old the student is.

15

Q

fou are defending it on the ground that is constitu­

16

tional and you deny the teacher any right to teach this even in

17

college?

18

Yes, sir, &s to whether this statute is vague and uncer

ID

tain or not, of coarse we alufied to this in our brief and our

20

basis for argument on this i3 that our statute was passed with th

21

ase of Scopes v. Tennessee in mind, wherein their statute was

22

rield valid and met the requirements that it was not vague and

23

uncertain.

24
25

We think that our statute is even better worded than
theirs.

So therefore, in the light of that decision and our

process.

we think that it meets the constitutional test of due

Q

What is the state interest you are protecting through

A

We feel that the state has a right to set the curricu­

6

7

states can prescribe their curriculum in schools and not have

;haos whenever they teach its courses there.

That is our main point, Your Honor, that

It could keep the

18

A

10

I would think that that should be prohibited, yes, sir.
To be consistent with my argument, I would have to say

20

;hat because I think that the state in prescribing the courses in

21

here.

On that theory, would you think that the state would

A

Yes.

This isn't the kind of case that would be presented —

this doesn't have to do with the subject to be taught

That is correct.

How about the sex?

Does Arkansas has any prohibitions

on teaching in the field of sex?
