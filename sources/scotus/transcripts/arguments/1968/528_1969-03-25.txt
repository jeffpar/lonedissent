ARGUMENT OF RANDALL C. COLEMAN * ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF
NACIREMA OPERATING COMPANY, INC.

3
to

MR. COLEMAN;

11

12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
The issues before the Court today are whether pier

13
14

injuries to longshoremen are injuries which occurred on navi­

15

gable waters of the United States and are, thus, within the

16

coverage of the Longshoremen’s Act.
Th® question was answered in the affirmative by the

17
13

Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and, therefore, as one

19

of the reasons that the Fourth Circuit decided the case affirma­

20

tively was that the Admiralty Extension Act broadened and ex­

21

panded the coverage of the Longshoremen’s Act, the Court will

22

also have before it the Admiralty Extension Act and whether or

23
24
25

not it did, in fact, extend the coverage of the Longshoremen’s
Act.
The facts in the case are undisputed and I will give

3

1

2

them, Your Honors, together with the history of the case.
These consolidated cases arose from pier injuries to three

3

longshoremen,,

4

the longshoreman,,

5

One of the injuries resulted in the death or

The cases arose, two of them, William Johnson and Joseph

6

Klosek, in Maryland* and one, Albert Avery, arose in Virginia,

7

They were pier injuries under virtually identical circumstances

8

because all three of the longshoremen involved were what is know

9

as "slingers".

They 'worked, and were working at the time of the

10

injuries, in gondola cars on piers.

They were slinging on cargo

11

which was attached to ships falls, or cables, which then loaded

12

the cargo which was being slung on, to the vessel.

13

The pier in the Maryland case was on the Pafcapsco River.

4

It extended out into that river approximately 600 feet, I believje,

15

6
7
10

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

and there is no question that the Patapsco River is navigable
waters of the United States,
The pier in the Virginia case, city piers of Norfolk, Vir­
ginia, extended, I think, about 1,000 feet into the Elisabeth
River,

There is also no dispute that the Elizabeth River is on

navigable waters of the United States.
It was found as a fact, and not disputed, that these long­
shoremen, in both cases, might have been working on the pier at
one time; they might also have gone aboard the vessel.

They soir

times switched positions.
It is also found as a fact, and undisputed, that these

1

particular piers were piers which were erected on pilings and

2

certain small craft could get under them, and I think canoes and

3

rowboats were named.

4

obstructed them.

Large vessels could not, because the piers

other two men, Johnson and Avery, were pinned against the side

11

of the railroad car.

12

The Deputy Commissioner found that those injuries, both

13

Deputy Commissioners, found that those injuries were injuries

14

which did not occur upon navigable waters.

The opinions of both

the Deputy Commissioners were then appealed to the District
Courts, first to the Eastern District of Virginia, and to the
District Court for the District of Maryland, and the District
Judges, Judge Hoffman from the Eastern District of Virginia,
and Judge Watkins of the District of Maryland, affirmed the find­
ings of the Deputy Commissioner.
The cases were then appealed to the Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit.

They were — first the Avery case and the

Johnson and Klosek cases, were first argued in separate panels,
and after that they were consolidated and the Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, en banc, heard all three cases.

The principle point upon which I rely is that for some years

the piers have been considered extensions of the land.

The

mentioned by the Court of Appeals below, and 1

think the Court of Appeals might have hada somewhat difficult

A number of cases from this Court were cited.
page 10 of our briefs.

They are on

The most recent that I can think of, of

this Court, is the opinion announced by Mr. Justice Black in
Swanson against Marra Brothers, which I think is still the law.
It is certainly the most well known case.

I will only quote

that portion of the opinion which relates to this point.
Swanson was a longshoreman who was injured on the pier when
a liferaft fell from the ship and injured him.

This Court said,

without dissent:
"But since the Act" — that’s the Longshoremen’s Act — "is
restricted to compensation for injuries occurring on navi­
gable waters, it excludes from its own terms, and from the
Jones Act, any remedies against the employer for injuries
inflicted on shore.

The Act leaves the injured employees
6

'3

in such eases to pursue the remedies afforded by local law» "

2

The Court then, and prior to that, had always considered

3

pier injuries to be shore injuries, and 1 submit. Your Honors,

4

that that is still the lav;»

5

The Court, this Court, has always followed, I believe, the

6

line of demarcation which was set out in the Jensen case years

7

ago, and that line is the line between State and Federal cover-

6

age, and specifically, it is the line between navigable waters

9

and land, or extensions of the land.

10
11

I think that has always

been the law.
So far as I know, there has never been a decision except

12

that of the Fourth Circuit which disputes that pier injuries are

13

considered as land injuries.

14

having occurred on the pier, don't fall within the stated excep­

15

tion of the Act, which is any drydock.

16

and detailed as to what they were by Mr. Justice Douglas in Avon­

17

dale Marine Ways against Henderson, I think, and it was clearly

13

pointed out that the types of drydock referred to are not wharves

19

or piers, as they are in this instance.

20

The injuries in this instance, all

Drydocks were explained

The injuries do not fall within the Court's exception, which

21

was in Mr. Justice Black's decision in Davis against the Depart­

22

ment of Labor, in the twilight zone.

23

understand it, is that sort of hazy area between the ship and

24

the pier where it is difficult to determine which coverage does

25

The twilight zone, as I

apply, and the Court, in the twilight zone cases, has held that

7

1

there may be both State and Federal coverage, and the injured

z

longshoremen may elect„

3

The case most heavily relied on by the Court below was

4

Calbeck against Travelers Insurance Company»

5

was discussed at some length, that this Court won't consider it

6

presumptuous of me, and particularly Mr. Justice Brennan, to try

7

to state what I think that case held.

8
9

I hope, since it

I do not think the case held, as the Court of Appeals below
said it held, that pier injuries could be covered by the Long­

10

shoremen 1 s Act.

11

involved two or more shipyard workers who were injured aboard

12

ships which were on navigable waters under new construction.

13

They were ships under construction.

14

That was a case, Your Honors will recall, which

Now, the Court had before it its prior holding in 1922 of

15

Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, and that case,

16

long ago, had established that there was a local concern in

17

ships that were under construction in navigable waters, and wher|e

18

there was such local concern

19

could apply, that there, and in that instance, the State Acts

20

may apply and Federal coverage did not come into effect.

21

that the State Compensation Acts

Now, I gathered from Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion, that

22

this Court was very much concerned with whether or not, in all

23

cases where there was local concern, and particularly in the

24

very case that was before it, there would definitely be coverage

25

for longshoremen who were injured.

8

There was a fear, I got froir

1

the opinion, that there might not be State or Federal coverage

2

somewhere for those men who were working in areas that the pre™

3

1927 decisions had set aside as local-concern areas,

4

So the Court in reversing the Fifth Circuit — I believe it

5

was the Fifth Circuit — held, that what this Act meant was pre­

S

cisely what it said.

7

to longshoremen on navigable waters.

8

it meant injuries on navigable waters.

9

It wanted to cover injuries which occurred
It didn't mean all injurie

There was no dispute, there is no dispute, there can be no

10

dispute, that ships under construction, just as much as ships

11

that have been built, are on navigable waters if they are afloat

12

or in a drydock, or in a marine railway.

13

Q

One of these men was knocked off the pier into the

water, wasn't he?

No, sir.

That was a case that was not brought up on

There were two men in Norfolk.
But you are quite right.

I cannot recall the
One was knocked off

10

Q

I see.

Would that make any difference?

19

A

Your Honor, to me that makes a difference in that I
I thi ik

20

felt, too, that that man was injured on navigable waters,

21

this is totally situs oriented and that a man who sustains his

22

injury in the ocean or in the river, in the water, is clearly

23

on navigable waters,

24
25

Q

That gets it down to a point that has the greatest

appeal to legal technicians, doesn't it?

9

1

2

A

X suppose whenever you draw a line, it is a difficult

line to draw? yes, sir»

Q

Here is a man working on a pier, two men working on a

the ship?

6

This is a crane, isn't it, or a line that is attached to

A

Well, in each instance — well, I know in the .Maryland

7

case there was a derrick or crane on the ship, and from that

8

derrick or crane a line descended to the gondola car and hoisted

9

the steel beams out.
Q

10

There is a ship here and there is a crane on it and a

11

line coming from the crane, two men working on the pier in my

12

hypothetical situation.

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

They are both hit.

One of them is just knocked to the

15

floor of the pier and he sustained injuries.

16

His fellow worker is knocked off the pier and into the water and,

17

that being navigable water, he is covered.
A

18

That is exactly it, Your Honor.

He is not covered.

Is that about it?
I know, I recognise,

19

I can't dispute that incongruities are going to develop wherever

20

a line is drawn.
Q

Didn't the Deputy Commissioner make an award in that

23

A

Oh, yes.

That is what I thought.

Mr. Coleman, suppose the man —•

X am not sure the Deputy Commissioner did, Your

Honor.

I know the Court of Appeals held

Well, I thought X read in the briefs that the

case.

That is right.

It did uphold the award in that

I haven’t borne that one particularly in mind —

9

Q

No, because that is not before us, but I thought

10

X read in the briefs, in a footnote someplace, that the Deputy

11

Commissioner had mad® that precise distinction, for the man

12

knocked in the water and drowned.

What happens if the longshoreman is on deck and

he is knocked onto the pier?

19

That is why X can't see the difference when he is

on the pier and gets knocked into the water.

It is the

Q

18

That:

Your Honor, again, you are hitting me right where

that line is drawn and it is tough.

22

Q

And you can't give the line up, obviously.

23

A

No, sir? X can't give the line up.

All that the

24

Court of Appeals has done below us, they have just redrawn the

25

line.

It is just a question of where you are going to draw it.

11

1

Wherever you draw it , somebody on the other side of it who is

2

aggrieved is going to be nudging and say, "I ought to be on that

3

side of it®"

4

I think this is a clearly established line»

I honestly

S

think it is a logical line to draw? that is, navigable waters,

6

it was drawn by this Court for constitutional reasons, navigable

7

waters and the land®

8

show what might happen if it were extended further shoreward®

9

They might sound far fetched, but they are not far fetched if

Now, there are a number of examples which

10

the Court adopts the status approach that was adopted by the

11

Fourth Circuit®

12

Any time the status approach is adopted, it is going

13

to be extremely difficult to tell what to do about that line®

14

But. if a clear situs approach is adopted, you know if it hap­

15

pened on navigable waters it was covered by this Act, if it hap­

16

pened on land or extensions of land it is covered by the State Act,

17

The Court, in Calbeck, went on to point out that the

18

pre-1927 decisions, which has been referred to in the respondents1

19

brief as static decisions where we should not freeze the line,

20

were those very decisions of local concern and it was brought

21

out in the Calbeck case, just as it was brought out in the Parker

22

against Motor Boat Sales before it, that the local-concern doc­

23

trine was said to have been read out of the Act and that it simply

24

means that where there are navigable waters, and the Court used

25

the term “navigable waters" frequently, that is where the Federal

12

1

Act applies»

2

The Coart also recognised in the Calbeck case the

Jensen line of demarcation.

4

cases.

5

case of Debardeleben which quoted that Congress intended to exer­

6

cise to the fullest extent its power to act in this area.

7

fullest extent was determined by the Court some time ago to be

8

where there are navigable waters, and apart from land or exten­

9

sions of land which were within the State compensation acts.

10

It had recognised it in previous

The Court cited iri the Calbeck case the Fifth Circuit

The

Judge Sobeloff, in the majority decision below, stated

11

that it would have been interesting if the three courts, or at

12

least if the Fifth Circuit which decided the case contrariwise

13

from the Fourth Circuit, if the Fifth Circuit had considered the

14

impact of the Calbeck decision in reaching the result which was

15

opposite this one.

16

The Fifth Circuit did not, in precise terms, refer to

17

the Calbeck decision.

18

scholarly opinion of Judge Watkins who had at length discussed

19

the Calbeck case because the Calbeck case had been argued to him.

20

It did, however, refer "to the extensive

In the Ninth Circuit case, which also held, that is,

21

Houser against O'Leary, that piers are extensions of the land anti

22

that pier injuries are covered by the State Act rather than the

23

Federal Act, there the Calbeck case was discussed at some length.

24
25

Q

Do you suggest that the admiralty jurisdiction at

its maximum extension would not reach an injury on a pier?

13

1

2

A

Mow wait a minute.

The Admiralty Extension Act,

Your Honor —

3

Q

I understand that* but a while ago you said that

4

it has been determined that the maximum extension of the admiral :y

5

jurisdiction still didn't reach an injury on a pier?

6

A

No, Your Honor»

You misunderstood me»

What I

7

said was that the Longshoremen's Act does not, that no extension

8

of the Longshoremen's Act will reach a pier injury because that,

9

is not on navigable waters»

10

Perhaps what you are asking me, Mr, Justice White, is

11

do I contend that Congress hasn’t the right in the exercise of

12

its maritima jurisdiction, to move all the way into the pier

13

and, thus, let the Longshoremen’s Act cover that?
I think, sir, that was the very point that was in

14
15

Jensen, and Knickerbocker, and Dawson, where they held no.

16

is the same constitution»
Q

17
18

It

So you do say, then, that admiralty jurisdiction

ends with the pier»
A

19

Not admiralty jurisdiction.

Admiralty jurisdic-

20

tion goes on land, Your Honor’s decision in Guitierres, by vir­

21

tue of the Admiralty Extension Act, but jurisdiction under this

22

statute is strictly limited to navigable waters by its terms»
Q

23
24
25

limited,

But what about the Congress saying that it isn’t

I suppose it could.
A

Is that it?

That is where it should be decided,

14

I think maybe

Congress could.» but it would be faced with this Court saying it
couldn't, back in Jensen, and Knickerbocker, and Dawson.
Q

Do you think Jensen is still the law?

A

Yes, sir.

It hasn't been overruled.

I remember

Your Honor's decision in Davis against the Department of Labor
when no one there suggested that it would be appropriate to try
to overrule Jensen because of the confusion it would create.
Now, I am mindful of the fact that the Solicitor Gen­
eral suggested in an appropriate case it might be a good idea,
but he also points out that this wouldn't be that case because
this calls for strictly an application of the Longshoremen's Act
Q

How much power do you think Congress was exercis­

ing in passing the Longshoremen's Act?
A

It was exercising the power granted it under

Article III, I think it is, the maritime power, in the area wharfs
the States may not act, and that Act, and where the maritime
jurisdiction extends under the very length discussion in those
three cases — Jensen, Knickerbocker, and Dawson -- was again
navigable waters, because the lands were within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the State.
Now, I am not at all sure that that would be followed
now.

All I know is, that is what it has been for some time.

Th<js

Court wrote fairly convincing opinions.
Q

What was the power of Congress, I suppose, in

passing the Admiralty Extension Act, was the maritime jurisdiction
15

1

wasn't it?

2

A

Well, they merely expanded the admiralty tort

3

jurisdiction, and I am not sure whether that was commerce or

4

whether it might have been maritime.

5

might have been commerce, but I am not sure.

6

I don't know.

I think it

But I knew that the approach given by the .Court below,

7

which is a status approach, certainly contradicts any idea that

8

the Admiralty Extension Act extends the coverage of the Longshore

9

men's Act.

10

I finally point out that the Court, in the Calbeck

11

case, also quoted extensively Senate Report 973, which was the

12

crux of th® legislative history, in a footnote, and in part it

13

said "Injuries occurring in loading or unloading are not

14

covered unless they occur on th® ship or between th© wharf and

15

the ship."

16

That is what Congress intended, and as I understand

17

this Court's decision in Calbeck and many others, it felt the

18

same way, and certainly did as recently as Calbeck.

19

Wow, to the Admiralty Extension Act, I believe the

20

reading of the Act itself makes it fairly clear that the Court

21

below, in finding that the Admiralty Extension Act did extend

22

the coverage of the Longshoremen's Act, was mistaken.

23

part of the Admiralty Extension Act, to which very little atten­

24

tion seems to have been paid, and which was not commented upon,

25

The second

is that in any such case suit may be brought in rem or in per son dm

1

according to the principles of law and the rules of practice

2

ARGUMENT OF HON. ERWIN N. GRISWOLD
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL
ON BEHALF OF DEPUTY COMMISSIONERS TRAYNOR AND OOSTING
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is solely one of statutory

19

construction, although there is, of course, a constitutional

20

background.

21

it is in a sort of never-never land, but I think it helps if we

22

focus on the fact that we are dealing with the construction and

23
24
25

In some ways, as Mr. Justice Fortas has indicated,

application of a statute which was passed by Congress in 1927,
more than 40 years ago, and has never been amended.
It is appealing to think that the time has come when
18

1

the statute hers involved should be given a broader sweep, as

2

the Court below has done, but it is an appeal, I submit, that

3

should be resisted in the interest of the proper allocation of

4

governmental powers„

5

We have become accustomed to growing and expanding

6

constructions of the Constitution, and there is reason for this,

7

since constitutions are often written in general terms and they

8

are hard to change.

9

In the area of statutory construction, though, Con­

10

gress always has the power to amend the statute if it thinks tha

11

is desirable, and in the allocation of powers between the great

12

branches of the government, it is the function of Congress to

13

amend statutes, and not of the Court, as this Court itself point* id

14

out in the Pilisbury case; involving the Longshoremen’s Act,

15

some years ago.

16

We don’t contend that the proper construction of the

17

statutory provision is a matter of black and white, as legal

?8

questions rarely are, but there are elements which we believe

19

point clearly enough to a decision.

20

section 903 of Title 33, and is set out just above the middle of

21

page 3 of the Government's brief. Beginning with the fourth

22

line of that provision, I would call attention to three elements

23
24
25

The relevant language is in

There is first "occurring upon the navigable waters
of the United States."

Now, "upon" is a common word and common

wor4s often have many shades of meaning.

2

place must take its content in party at least, from its back­

3

ground, the most important element of which was the Jensen case.

4

The dictionary definition of ’‘upon” is short and sweet

This word in this

5

I looked it up this morning in the Second Edition of Webster's

6

International:

7

"on" and "on" is defined as "The position of contact with or

8

against a supporting surface."

9

'’Upward so as to be one™

That makes us turn to

I don't think the dictionary definition helps a great

10

deal, but it does make it apparent that here the men were upon

11

the pier, and not upon the water.

12

But in addition to the Jensen case, there was also the

13

Nordenholt case, not to mention the Cleveland Terminal and Valley

14

Railroad case, both of which were well known when the statute

15

was written.

be outside the admiralty jurisdiction.

17

18

can travel beneath the piers on the water, but that is not where

19

20

fixed in land.

In both of those cases, pier injuries were held to

They were

20

?

same sense that they were here, but no one would say that a par­

2

son on a bridge was upon the water, even though ships could pass

3

underneath«

4

Next we come to the phrase, immediately following, in

5

parentheses "(including any dry dock)”.

Note that this is in­

6

cluding any dry dock, not any dock or any dock or pier.

7

fact that Congress expressly included any "dry dock” is some

8

indication that it did not include other docks or piers.

9

suggest that the other construction is impossible.

The

I don9-:

I do submit

10

that it is unlikely and that the construction which would make

11

the Act applicable to injuries occurring on any dock or pier is

12

not only unnatural in the light of the situation which Congress

13

understood when it wrote the statute, but also makes this phrase

14

of little use in the statute.

15

think, be avoided.

16

Such a construction should, I

Finally, in this same few lines of the statute, we

17

come to the last clause, "and if recovery for the disability or

18

death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly

19

be provided by State law.”

20

Now, it is said that this last clause was written out

21

of the statute by this Court's decision in the Calbeck case.

22

am planning to devote the final portion of my available time to

23
24

25

X

a discussion of the Calbeck case, but I will say now that X do
not think the statement I have just recounted is true.

Writing

provisions of the statute is not the function of the Court, and

21

1

I donct interpret the Calbeck decision as attempting to do so.

2

On the contrary, the present case is, I submit, an

3

excellent example of a situation where this final clause is

4

applicable and is dispositive of the question of construction

5

and of the litigation.

6

Turning specifically to the question of construction,

7

I have already referred to the language of the statute, but the

8

argument is confirmed by the legislative history,

8

including this jurisdictional language, was of course passed

The statute,

10

following the Jensen decision, and the two cases where the Court

11

struck down the first two attempts of Congress to deal with the

12

problem.
Not only was the Jensen case there with clear terri­

13
14

torial implications, but this Court had already decided the

15

Nordenholt case in 259 U»S. in an opinion by Mr, Justice

16

McReynolds, who was the author of the Jensen opinion, and the

Court held

The Court, in its opinion, referred to

the doctrine that ‘'locality” is the exclusive test of admiralty
jurisdiction." It said "Isands, who was the injured workman, was
injured upon the dock, an extension of the land. See Cleveland

I

But Congress took that out, and substituted in its

7
8

'

place, the language which has persisted unchanged for more than
40 yearsf "upon the navigable waters of the United States, in­
cluding any dry dock.”

This showed a clearly territorial approach

which is surely understandable in the light of the decisions as
they stood at that time.
Next I would point out that this was the immediate and

3
long continued, consistent, administrative construction of the
4
/

statute, which should be given great weight at this late date.
5
23
i

1

Almost at once, and in a long series of rulings, the

2

administrative agency charged with the application of the statute

3

construed it not to apply to pierside injuries, as it has done

4

in this case.
Finally, since the statute was enacted, this Court's

5

6

decisions lead to the same conclusion.

As long ago as 1941, this

7

Court said, in Parker against Motor Boat Sales, “The field in

8

which a State may not validly provide compensation must be taken .

9

for the purposes of the Act, as the same field which the Jensen

10

line of decision excluded from State compensation laws.

Without

11

affirming or rejecting the constitutional implications of those

12

cases, we accept them as the measure by which Congress intended

13

to mark the scope of the Act they brought into existence."
Shortly thereafter, in Davis against the Department

14
15

of Labor, the Court said, "Congress has, by the Longshoremen's

16

Act, accepted the Jensen line of demarcation between State and

17

Federal jurisdiction.”
More specifically, in Swanson against Marra Brothers

IS
19

Company, to which Mr. Coleman has referred, the Court held almost

20

directly that a pierside injury was covered by the Longshoremen's

21

Act, citing and relying on the Nordenholt case.
I turn now to the Calbeck case, which is, of course,

22
23
24
25

an important authority in the construction of the Longshoremen's
Act.

My submission is that it supports our construction of the

statute.

Some language in it is taken out of context to sustain

24

1

the contrary argument, but that argument will not survive, I

2

submit, when the language is placed in the context of the deci­

3

sion as a whole.
In the first place, we must give consideration to the

4

S

actual facts of the Calbeck case.

The language of an opinion,

6

of course, takes significance as applied to the facts which were

7

before the Court, and in the Calbeck case the Court was dealing

8

with an injury to an employe® who was working on a ship which

9

was afloat on navigable waters.
This is the clearest possible situation within the

10

1!

admiralty jurisdiction, and within the Jensen case. The workmen

12

there were on the water side of the Jensen line of demarcation.

13

What the Court said there has great relevance to injuries which

14

are so clearly maritime. That this was the area on which the

15

Court focused is clearly shown by the repeated references in the,

16

opinion to "injuries incurred on navigable waters."

17

occurs at least nine times in the opinion, with slight variations.

This phrase I

As to such injuries, the Court did use some rather

18
18

broad language, but it was only such injuries that were actually

20

before the Court.

21

is shown by its reference to the Act's adoption of, and here

22

again I quote, "the Jensen line between admiralty and State

23

jurisdiction as the limit of Federal coverage," and its refer-

24

ence to the fact that in Davis against the Department of Labor,

That the Court did not intend to go further

,

I
25

the Court had pointed out that, and again I quote, "The Act

25
.

1

adopts the Jensen line of demarcation.,”

2

It should be observed, too, that, in the Calbeck case

3

the Court, at page 129, cited the Nordenholt case with approval,

4

where it had been held just before the enactment of the statute

5

that injuries on piers were on the State authority side of the

6

Jensen line of demarcation.

7

8

Thus, Calbeck, when closely examined, deals only with
the water side of the Jensen line of demarcation.

A

18

Certainly a barge floating beside a ship, which

19

is being used in unloading a ship, would be within the admiralty

20

jurisdiction, and I do not recall a case which has involved a

21

floating pier, but I think it is very likely that would be held

22

to be within the admiralty jurisdiction.
Certainly it was not the situation which was involved

23
24
25

in the Nordenholt case, which was a fixed structure built on
land.

26

'3

Calfoeek, as I have said? does accept the Nordenholfc

2

case and makes it plain that a pierside injury,, such as that in­

3

volved here , is and always has been understood to foe covered by

4

the State Acts, and is, thus, outside the scope of the Longshore™

5

men’s Act, not only because the injury is on the State side of

Q

the Jensen line of demarcation, but also because coverage of the

1

Longshoremen’s Act is expressly excluded by the final clause of

8

section 3(a), since a remedy under the State Act is clearly

3

available, and this is the case, it seams to me, where that final

10

clause can properly be applied»
In the Calbeck case, the Court did quote soma rather

11
12

expansive language from Judge Hutchison in the Debardeleben

13

Coal case, but nevertheless, the case itself involves injuries

14

which were clearly on the water side of the Jensen line of de­

15

marcation.
Congress did undertake to use its authority to the

16
17

full as it then understood its authority to be under this Court’s

18

decisions.

19

the line which it understood to be the Jensen line of demarca­

20

tion, to which this Court has frequently since made reference,

21

although it may be that it could draw the line someplace else

22

if it were enacting the statute now, and I think it could, this

23

is the place where it did draw the line when it ena.cted this

24

25

In undertaking to meet its responsibilities, it drew

statute in 1927.

Nothing that has happened 3ince is an appro­

priate reason for a court to draw the line someplace else.

This is 209 of 373 U.S.

mitted by an amicus on behalf of petitioners.
"Various farfetched hypotheticals are raised, such as

that the duty to provide a seaworthy ship and gear, includ­

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

We think we have a very analogous situation here.

We

feel that the Longshoremen's Act applies whether the man is on
the deck of the ship or on the deck of the pier, and the basis
of that is that the foundation of the Longshoremen's Act is the
admiralty power of the United States.

It is the same power which

gave rise to the enactment of the Jones Act, which again was an
employer-employee relationship.
40

of that jurisdiction, and in recognition of its humanitarian

We feel that it is almost incomprehensible to hold

We say this would be a harsh and incongruous result

Well* what was the so-called Jensen line?

12

A

The Jensen line, Your Honor, as I understand it,

13

is solely a decision that the States cannot legislate in the

14

admiralty field, for the simple reason that it must be uniform.
Q

15

Did the Jensen case define what that line was

16

between — did it have anything to do with docks, and gangplanks

57

and ships?

18

A

Jensen itself, Your Honor, Jensen was a longshore

19

man who operated an electric truck, who went back and forth frorr

20

the pier to the ship.

21

out of the ship’s hold onto the gangway? it somehow became

22

fouled up; he went back and he hit his head on the ship and

sustained a broken neck.

25

He was killed when he was taking cargo

So Jensen sustained his injury as a

It was held that his injury was within the Federal

43

1

domain and that the New York State Compensation Act could not

2

be applied.

That is the factual backdrop of the Jensen decision.

1

Following that? Congress tried to pass two different laws, but

4

neither on© passed judicial scrutiny by this Court, because both

5

laws tried to confer on the State authority to act in this field

6

and this Court stated that that would interfere with, disrupt,

7

and perhaps destroy the uniformity that we must have in the

a

admiralty field.
Q

"As we said in a slightly different factual context,

In the conclusion portion of my brief, commencing on
45

I

page 34, I set forth various anomalies and bizarre situations

't
A..

which the petitioners are requesting this Court to ratify and
support.

’

If I may touch briefly on the legislative history of

4

the Act, if one thing stands out preeminently, it is the Con-

5

gressional resolve to avoid the constitutional pitfalls of lack

6

of uniformity which caused Congress to stumble in its two ear lie::

7

attempts to help longshoreman„ the preoccupation of the chairman

8

with uniformity, and his apprehensiveness over its possible'

9

vitiating absence.
Seamen were left out of the Act.

10

The only omission

1i

is seamen.

Everything else there is to extend and enlarge it,

12

and that is why they put in "including any dry dock”, because

13

in a normal, factual, common-sense appraisal, a drydock is not

14

upon navigable waters.

So that was a term of inclusion.

The chairman was concerned because seamen were omitted.

15
16

This preoccupation is apparent throughout all the proceedings,

17

the Senate hearings, and also the hearings before the House of

18

Representatives.
Now, with reference to the uniformity of full coverage,

19
20

there was just about unanimous accord.

21

Houses wanted to avoid the constitutional flaw in the law.

22

Labor, both the ILA and the shipyard unions, wanted full cover­

24
25

Management supported it.

on the pier and 75 percent aboard ship

tected by the Act, is striving to defeat the very uniformity

11

that Congress not only strove for, but actually achieved.

12

My final comment will be this. Your Honors:

13

come as a shock to petitioners, who are so patently enamored of

14

some pre-1927 views, but one cannot thrust the mighty 42-year

15

oak of the Act back into its embryonic acorn.

22
23
24
25

This injury was upon the navigable waters.

The injury

was upon the navigable waters both factually and legally.
Going right to the question that was asked about Jen­

Now, the New York people wanted to give this fellow

compensation.

11

of Appeals of New York,

12

Jensen, they said, "We can't give this fellow compensation.

13

Because in Jensen the Court had said the work of a stevedore is

14

maritime in nature and his employment was a maritime contract."

15

16
17
18

19
2
21

22
23

24
25

It went up through the courts, through the Court
which included Cardoza, and, reading
Why ?

Injuries which he received were, likewise, maritime, and the
rights and liabilities of the parties in connection therewith
were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction, and so
even if they were on the dock, they couldn't get compensation.
Then the Nordenholt case came along, and this is his­
tory, which Mr. Justice Brennan went through in the Calbeck case
to come out with the holding in Calbeck, which is very important
in this Court.

Now you come up with Nordenholt.

In Nordenholt, the Court said, "Well, this fellow fell
down from a bag, a stack or pile on the dock and there is no
pertinent Federal statute," and they started the local concern
49

i

doctrine.

They said, "It is a bad result.

Let’s start a local

concern doctrine.

Now, let's go back to poor Johnson.

Going on to the argument, it is clear that Calbeck

expressly repudiated a determination on the basis of the line

of demarcation, and this is quoting from Calbeck again, a line

of demarcation as a static one fixed at pre-1927 constitutional

decisions.

The Court, in Calbeck, holds that there are areas

May I say one last thing, Judge, and

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
MR. RABINOWITZs

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, I say to this

Court in conclusion that this case could be affirmed and should
be affirmed.

It could be affirmed on a very narrow ground, and

that is that all these fellows, all these longshoremen — remem­
ber, this is an Act called the Longshoremen8s Act, passed for
the benefit of longshoremen -- were injured by ship's gear
while serving the ship, and they were on areas that were con­
structed over the navigable waters of the United States.

the Court:

I have about a minute left.

I would like to call

Mr. Justice White’s attention, and I will not attempt to read

it, but at page 25, Your Honor, of the appendix, Judge Watkins,

11

the District Judge who decided these cases, did go into the

12

legislative history of the Extension Act.

13

The last thing I would say, Your Honors, is that I

14

think it becomes abundantly clear why the argument made by the

15

respondent should be made to the legislature, when one considers

16

that there are States in which the benefits afforded by the

17

State Acts exceed those afforded by the Federal Act, and in thos
