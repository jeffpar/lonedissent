ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLI,AM M. ACKER, R. , ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. ACKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

a

Court, the Petitioners, Glover and Otis were the plaintiffs

9

below.

10

This case comes here purely and simply on the pleadings.
The plaintiffs were 14 railroad carmen helpers.

II

Their complaint in the District Court charged a cooperative

12

scheme by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company and

13

their Brotherhood, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of

14

America, to perpetuate a long-existing racial discrimination

15

in the area of seniority by the device of using what they

16

call apprentices to do the traditional work of carmen helpers;

17

that is, white apprentices, so that, the Negro carmen helpers

10

will continue not to get promoted to the classification of

19

carmen.
This device has caused a bottleneck in seniority

20
21

which affects not only the Negro carmen helpers but the White

22

carmen helpers unfortunately behind them on the seniority

23

roster.

24
25

The District Court dismissed the case on the grounds
that the plaintiffs had not alleged an exhaustion of one of

2

Ii

their remedies before the National Railway Adjustment Board.

2

Two, their remedy within the union itself, and,

3

Three,

4

their remedy provided by the Collective

Bargaining Agreement.

3

There were no specific allegations in the complaint

S

as to the character of these two supposed contractual remedies

7

or even if they existed, but the District Court nevertheless

3

concluded that they both were, as he said, “available" and

9

must be employed.

10

?i

The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and this Court has
granted certiorari.

12

Let me say that some people do not like the concept

13

of seniority as a criterion for job assignment emd promotion.

14

2 don't think it is for me to be for or against this concept.

15

It is just a fact of labor life, and racial discrimination in

16

the application of this concept is where discrimination hurts

17

the most.

I

It hurts the pocketbook.
I submit that to eliminate invidious discrimination

13
19

in this area can lead ultimately to its elimination in other

20

sectors of our national life.
While I was on the airplane coming up from Birmingham, I

21

with the plane jumping up and down, I grabbed something to get

23

my mind off of -that, and

Despite that disclaimer, there are a couple of

8

things in this article that I would like to read and that I

9

think have particular bearing»

10

The sub headline says, "For nearly a century, most

unions have forced Negroes into Jim Crow locals, giving them

12

dirty jobs or refused to admit them at all»

53

repeated union promises are not stopping prejudice."

Then, down in the body, it says this;

23
24
25

reminiscent of the one by the Southern School District

Now, if we may, let's see where the lower court's
reasoning in this case would lead these plaintiffs.
First, what about the internal union complaint

1

procedures?

2

The Trial Court said that such procedures were there, j

For the sake or argument, therefore, we will have to assume,

allegations by the plaintiff, no allegation by the defendants.

8

It would be unbecoming of me

There are no allegations as to what they are, no

However, I think it is not unsophisticated for this

9

Court, just as I know it knows that the plaintiffs could not

10

get damages — damages — that is one of the things they are

1!

suing for —■ money damages — for past discrimination from the

12

union.

13

is, are they going to be able to get what they are asking for

14

here -- damages?

If they go through the union constitution, such as it

It is just as easy, I think, to know that they cannot |

17

people.

18

The Union does not promote

The decision that they theoretically could hope

19

for with the union alone would be an admission by the union,

20

by some top decision-making body or some policy-making body of

21

the union ‘that the union was wrong in failing to take their

22

grievance to the company.

23

fa® union procedures.

24
25

Q

That is all they could hop© for with

Don't you allege a conspiracy, so to speak, be­

tween the union and the employer here in your complaint?

5

I

A

Yes, we do.

2

Q

I don’t know that yon use the word

"conspiracy" j

3

or joint action by these co-defendants in depriving your clients

4

of promotion and the pay that goes with promotion,,

S

A

Exactly.

6

Q

Then, why couldn’t they get damages from the

7
3

9
10

union if you are right?
A

I don’t think they could get damages from the

union within the union constitutional procedures.
We are discussing constitutional procedures within

11

the union that are not plead and the court does not have any

12

way to know what those procedures are.

13

I will say that the union constitution does not

14

provide a method for the union to compensate someone monetarily

15

for some wrongdoing

16

point — what they could get there theoretically.

17

and that is all I am discussing at this

Now, what could they expect from the company if

18

they processed a grievance without the union’s blessing and

19

in the face of its active opposition?

20

The actual grievance machinery here again is not

£1

spelled out in the complaint, but in these matters it is easy

22

to know that they would get nowhere.

23

with the company in the face and in the teeth of their own

24

union’s opposition and collusion, then, according to the Fifth

25

Circuit, the Court from which tills case comes in

If they sought redress

Haynes against U. S. Pip®, a case that was cited by the Dis­

z

trict Court in its Memorandum Opinion,, then there would be no

4

i

The Fifth Circuit is not saying that you exhaust your j

5

administrative remedies within the company and if you are not

S

satisfied you then to go Court.

7

exhaust your administrative remedy within the company even if

8

the last and ultimate method that the employee employees is to

9

get his union to strike.

They are saying in Haynes, you

If that does not work, he is finished.

10

This is what the Fifth Circuit Sayss

11

"At this point* the decision denying him relief was

12

final.Under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement*

13

are the processes of the Court now vailable to him for con­

!4

testing or voiding that final decision?"

13

We are talking about intra-company procedures.

In

29

where the grievance procedure was final and the Court’s opinion

21

was against the appellant.

22
23
24
25

the union did not faithfully represent him.
He does not charge fraud on either
This is a case

This means the Fifth Circuit in Haynes would say
that unless the plaintiffs here would bite off the tremendous
burden after having exhausted this machinery that the District
Court and the Fifth Circuit say we must exhaust, unless we want

7

bite off the burden and take on the burden of proving fraud on
the part of the union and the company — fraud •— then we have
no

judicial review»

Then we have reached the end of the road

by referring this matter to the grievance machine.,
Now what could the plaintiffs reasonable expect from
the National Railroad Adjustment Board?
The 1966 revisions of the Railway Labor Act came too
late for Mr. Glover and his friends.
1965.

They filed this case in

The carmen in their brief admit to an average of three

years for processing a claim before the NARB, Second Division.
The railroad admits to less, but this court in Walker v.
Southern Railway was not only impressed by the unreasonable
delayes before the NARB, before the 1966 revisions, which would
make the NARA proceedings applicable here just as in Walker,
but by the absence of any judicial review in the event of a
decision adverse to the individual employee.
The Court says, "The Congress also found if an
employee receives an award in his favor by the Board, the
railroad affected may obtain justicial relief from that award
by declining to recognise that award.

If, however, an employee

fails to receive an award in his favor, there is no means by
which judicial review may be obtained."
That point is argued In our brief at some length, but
thiparticular case was not erf erred to, the most recent on
that point.

We think that as constituted, as created, as

8

j

1

conceived by the Congress, the NARB is not able or designed

2

for handling this kind of grievance.

3

Q

I take it there is no question that the individui ill

employee as distinguished from the union may energisse the

S

grievance procedure in the railroad business?
A

contract between the union and the railroad does not say

anything about grievances.

cases has said that a remedy —-

Q

Let me put it this way:

May Congress say in

13

a claim of this kind you must first follow the administrative

procedure before you go to court?

My own personal view, Mr. Justice Brennan, would

16

be that this particular tribunal as constituted, with an absence

17

of judicial review from an adverse decision to an employee, if

25

the Congress required it and attempted to overrule by legislatioi.
the Steele and Tunstall cases as I interpret them, I think the
Congress would have enacted unconstitutional legislation.
That is my personal view.
1 obviously do not have time to comment on all of the
important cases bearing on the exhaustion of remedies, but I
would like to discuss these:

Republic Steel against Maddox,

Vaca against Sipes, NRLB against Shipbuiiding Local 22, recently
denied by the Third Circuit.
-in

-

If I have any time, I would like to mention Conley v.
Gibson and Walker against Southern Railway.
In Republic Steel against Maddox, the Maddox case firs
off did not involve a claim against a man's union as well as
the company for which he worked.

The majority of the Court in

that ca.se considered it a run-of-the-mill discharge case and
simply held that Mr. Maddox should have employed the grievance
machinery which there was clearly provided by the collective
bargaining agreement under the evidence.

The collective bar­

gaining agreement was there for the Court to examine and to
determine that it wars available.
In this case, it is not there.

It has not been

declared by us, and it has not been declared by the defendants.
The Court said, 5iXn a general rule to which Federal
law applies, Federal labor policy requires that individual
employees wishing to to assert contract grievances must attempt
use of the contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer
and union as the mode of redress."
It continued;

"If the union refuses to press or

only perfunctorily presses the individual's claim, differences
may arise as to the forms of redress then available.

But unless

the contract provides otherwise, there can be no doubt that the
employee must afford the union the opportunity to act on his
behalf."
Nov/, we ammended this complaint after Judge Lynn

Threw us out.

sir, no question whatsoever.

What is the basis for your claim that you don't j

really have a remedy before the Board?

Is it just that it is

inadequate, or did you say the Board can't handle a claim by
a union member against a union?
A

That is right.

There is no statute that con­

stitutes that.

That is what the Court said in Steele, wasn't it?

Q

Let us get Steals and Tunstall clear first.

Neither of those would get you into court against the employer;
is that right?
A

I think they would, based on their language.

They are certainly distinguishable on their facts as far as the
union being present.
Q

They said there wasn’t any remedy before the

Board because it was a suit againt the union.
A

Thar, is one thing they said.

Q

It is very critical, isn’t it?

A

I think it is one critical point of those

decisions, but 1 do think that they are both not just susceptibl e
by a sweeping argument to conclude from it that in cases where
invidious discrimination sixch as racial discrimination is
involved, then the doors of the Court are opened.

I think

they are susceptabla to that without stretching it beyond the
opinion, beyond what they say.
Of course, those cases preceded the Conley Case
and Hayes Case against the Union Pacific.

That was purely and

simply a case wherethe employees were asking for an interpreta­
tion of the collective bargaining agreement which we conced
we are asking for, and the company was the prime defendant, and
it was named Union Pacific Railroad Company.
This court held in that case where the charge was
collusive

discrimination, it was just like this one, unanimously,

t
2

that that case was decided wrong.
Now, if the Court meant that as 1 think they did,

3

then they were saying as I read that case that in all cases —

4

now, I may not be able to prove this»

3

opportunity to prove it -- just the opportunity to prove that

6

this union representing them and this company got together at

7

their expense, and if I can prove that, and if any plaintiff

8

similarly situated can make a charge like this and make it

9

stick, then 1 submit under the footenote four, Conley against

10

Gibson, then they should have that right and the doors of the

n

Court should be open.

Black's position in that case, the case should be reversed,

16

I think, on the reasoning of the majority as expressed by

17

Mr. Justice White.

Mr„ Justice Black adhered to his dissent

18

I don't believe that the concurring opinion of Mr.

19

Justice Fortas, which was joined in by Mr. Justice Harlan —

20

and I have forgotten which other of the Court joined in him --

21

doesn't deal with the issues in this case, but the majority

said the following things in ¥aca.

Q
A

386 O.S.
'The Preemption Doctrine, however, has never

been rigidly applied to cases where it could not be inferred
that Congress intended exclusive jurisdiction to lie with the
NLRB.*'
This lies with the NLRB, but 1 think that case fits
the NARB.

While these exceptions in no way underline the

preemption rule where applicable, theydemonstrate the presump­
tion over a given class of cases must depend upon the particular
interests being asserted and the effect upon the administrationj
of national labor policies of current judicial and administrativ e
remedies.
"It is not applicable to cases involving alleged
breaches of the

union's duty of fair representation," which

I think applies here.
"It can be doubted whether the Board brings substan­
tially greater expertise on these problems than do the courts
which have been engaged in this type of review since the Steele
decision.
"In addition to the above considerations, the unique
interests served by the duty of fair representation doctrine
have a profound effect, in our opinion, on the applicability
of the presumption rule to this class of cases."
The Court recognised in Steele that the congressional
grant of power to a union to act as exclusive collective

17

bargaining representative with its corresponding reduction in
the individual rights of the employee so represented would
raise grave constutional problems if unions were free to
exercise this power to further racial discriminatione"
Since that landmark duty0 the decision has stood as

j

a bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct against individuals
stripped of redress of the provisions of Federal labor law»
"However, because these contractual remedies have been
devised and often controlled by the employer, they may well
prove unsatisfactory and unworkable for the individual grieving,

An obvious situation in which the employee should noe be
limited is in the exclusive remedial procedures and when the
document of the employer amounts to a repudiation of these
contractual procedures."

We say repudiation.

I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD Wo FISHER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, at the beginning of my address, I should like to point
out first of all that this is not a Civil Rights Act suit and
point out as the court below pointed out in the memorandum
opinion that substantially the same plaintiffs have alleged a
violation of their civil rights under Title 7 and that particu­
lar matter is being processed at the present time in the Dent

18

Case to which reference was made inthe Look article commented
upon by Mr, Acker»
So any possible unfair employment practices which
have been committed against these individuals, and I do not at.
all concede or intimate that any were committed, is in the
process of litigation in the lower courts at the present time
and has no real connection with the instant case.

The instant

case is a Railway Labor Act case,
Q

Under Title 7 of the Civil Fights Act, can

the union be"made a defendant?
A

The union was made a defendant in that

proceeding, sir,
Q

In addition to the employer?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

The group of the petitioners involved is a

racially mixed group,, as Mr. Ackerman pointed out.

There are

I believe, eight Negro members of the group and six white
members of the group.

So it is not on the sarface a normal

type of racial discrimination case where all of the members
are members of a minority racial or religious group.
The Brotherhood and the Carrier, and I am speaking
in this instance for both of them, holds no belief for racial
discrimination in any form.

The Brotherhood and the Carrier

concede that no contract or arrangment which makes invidious
discriminations or hostile discriraations based on race, color

19

f

creed, national origin should be or could be countenanced

2

and that is not the issue in the case in its present posture.

3

The question involved is whether the plaintiffs

4

pleaded a sufficient attempt to eschaust admistrative contractu-al

S

remedies to allow them to remain in court.

interesting parallel to the Court’s decision in Vaca

1

In Vaca v, Sipes, the union alone, the Court will recall, was

8

named in a law suit, but in the course of its opinion, the

9

court indicated that perhaps the employer should have been

to

joined in that particular action because, in fact, both the

11

employer and the union had interests and could be adversely

12

affected by the nature of the complaint,

13

j

Now, in Vaca v^ Sipes, which was not a case arising

14

under the Railway Labor Act, the claim against the employer

13

for breach of a collective bargaining contract, for wrongful

16

discharge, if youwill, was a legally cognizable claim.

It

'

1?

was a judiciable claim and the claim against the union for

18

duty of fair representation was a legally cognisable claim,

19

so this court quite properly held the two could perhaps in

20

future suits, subsequent to Vaca, should be joined together

23

in one action.

22

But in the present case, the claim of the employee

23

against the carrier for violation of his employment rights

24

as embodied in a collective bargaining agreement and perhaps

25

in customs and practices has been uniformally held by this

20

t

Cour for a number of years to foe nonjudieiable»

2

under no stretch of the imagine can be combined with a claim

3

against the union for alleged breach of the duty of fair

4

representation because, as Mr. Justice White indicated in

some of his questions, the matter must be submitted before the

against their best interests, do they not?

Yes, the allegation is

Then I have three short questions.

If Congress

I would not believe it would be, sir.

would be the final arbiters as to which side was right? would
that be due process?

The difference between that situation and this

situation?

8

situation is at the highest level the carrier group and the

9

union groups appoint individuals who are designated by Federal

io
11

statute to act as arbitrators.
This Court has said fchatthe National Railroad Adjust­

12

ment procedure is compulsory arbitration, and I believe it would

13

be indeed presumptuous to assume that the arbitrators who are

14

appointed — it is true they are appointed by a carrier group

15

a high level carrier group and a high level union group who wou

16

not discharge their duties under law the same as all citizens.

17

Perhaps I am getting mixed in my syntax.

18

presumptions certainly would be the carrier members and the

19

labor members abide by the law.

20

racial discrimination bring forth a correct constructive

21

application of railroad bargaining agreements?

22

I think the

As a matter of fact, I think it has been recognised

23

by this court that miscarriages of justice will probably result

3

Q

How do you get around Steele?

It seems to me

4

this kind of remedy before the Board is not the kind of

5

remedy that has to be exhausted because of the factors that

6

Mr» Justice Marshall mentioned and others»

7

In Steele the defense was there»

They had not

8

exhausted the remedies and the Court has just said that that

9

remedy is not much of a remedy when this great charge of

10

racial discrimination is made.

I!

so far as you know?

12

A

No, sir»

Has that case ever been modified

The Steele case was not a case

13

involving a claim for an interpretation of rights under an

14

agreement»

face, it was discriminatory against the Negro firemen who

16

were classified as ’’non-proraotable.w

Do you mean that, the Court wasted its time

talking about this remedy in ther terms that it did?

22

A

No, sir, Mr» Justice White»

23

Q

They took it seriously?

24

A

The Court in the Steele case, I believe, said

25

that this was not a matter that was to be heard before the
23

1

the Adjustment Board because the hostile discrimination

3.

against these individuals engaged in by the union could not

3

be remedied before the Adjustment Board, and that was the

4

suit which established, as I understand it, the so-called

5

"Civil Action for Breach of the Duty of Fair Representation.”

6

1 concede on behalf of the Brotherhood that the

7

Brotherhood is amenable to suit, not under the terms of this

8

collective bargaining contract which is to be construed exclu­

0

sively by the Adjustment Board, but is amenable to suit on the

10

theory that it failed to accord the plaintiffs their right of

11

fair representation, and I think this case raises the question

12

whether a plaintiff who is a railroad employee and is repre­

13

sented by the Brotherhood and is also a member of the Brother­

14

hood, as in the Sfeeale case, the Negro firemen were not members

IS

of the Brotherhood nor were they eligible to be members of

10

the Brotherhood»

17

But in this case the plaintiffs are and are conceded

18

to be in the pleadings to be members of the Brotherhood»

19

think the question arises whether they do not have the same

20

duty as other members of the Brotherhood to attempt to invoke

21

the procedures under the union constitution to, in other

22

words, require the Brotherhood to accord them their due

23

rights of representation»

question whether those particular employees who were in the

members of the Brotherhood.
In any event, the question of their need to exhaust

7

remedies under the union constituion was not discussed and

not decided.

18

the National Railroad Adjustment Board, and this has been

There are no exceptions to that rule except in the

one instance when an employee accepts a discharge as final,

the Moore y„ Illinois Central exception, and then attempts

to sue the carrier for damages only.

tion was alleged to be that the Brotherhood would process

Yes, Conley was limited to the dlaim that the

Q

As 1 read Hayes„ and I know you haye not

seen it yet-—
A

I have seen the ease»
!

Q

That was an action charging the railroads

with the discriminatory application in this matter of
seniority and promotion which stemmed from the collective
bargaining agreements and the Court of Appeals in that case
said there is an adequate remedy before the Board and the
Court, as 1 read footnote 4, disapproved that holding.
In your case, I do not see that it happens
to involve allegation of discrimination between the railroad

?

and the union, but I don’t see that footnote 4 makes that
inapplicable in your ease.

A

In the Conley v„ Gibson case, that dealt with

the duty of the railroad to press the grievance when they
were asked to press a grievance.

When the grievance was

filed, the Brotherhood refused to press it, and they did it
because of race, and this Court held that that was a duty,
f

a violation of duty of fair representation.

We say the question raised here* even though there may

arguably be an allegation that the Brotherhood refused to act
on behalf of these plaintiffs in a proper manner* since they
were members of the union* since they didn't have the duty

of the Landrum-Griffin Act* the duty to attempt to get action
T?£^hout suing the union* by the same token* we say when the
contract is admitted to be a proper contract*, the contract
is not discriminatory* the contract is not being attacked*
but the railroad is breaching the contract and the union is
concluding with the railroad in the breach of this agreement?
that* however* it is not at all clear that this contract
gives them the rights as helpers to be promoted to carmen

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. FISHER:

B

Mr. Fisher, you may

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

20urt,
To go back to the point which I left at the noon

10

cecess, in talking about the Tunstall case and the Steele case.

1?

It seems to me that the carrier and the Brotherhood again say

\z

that regardless of who the parties were in these cases, the

13

cases involve the duty of a labor union to accord to minority

14

tiembers of a craft or class fair representation.

15

I think that is put in sharp outline by the opening

16

statement of Chief Justice Stone, who said that the question of

17

whether the Railway Labor Act imposes on a labor organization

18

acting by authority of the statute as the exclusive bargaining

19

representative of a craft or class of railway employees , the

20

luty to represent all the employees of the craft without dis~

21

crimination because of their race, and if so, whether the courts

22

lave jurisdiction to protect the minority of the craft or class

23

from the violation of such obligation.

24

25

And to point out further, regardless of who the
arties were, that the court also noted that there no differences
36

1

between the parties in the Field ease or in the Tunstall ease,
for that matter, as to the interpretation of the contract on

3

page 205 of the court's opinion,» nor are there any differences

4

as to the- interpretation of contract which, by the act are

S

committed to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Adjustment Board.

s

Now in the Tunstall case» it is true that it was

7

a discriminatory application» that the union was the guilty

0

party, the most guilty party that violated the duty of fair

9 1 representation.
Now, again in Oonley versus Gibson the thrust was

10
11

against the union for refusing to process these grievances, and

12

and we concede in this case that the union cannot discriminate.

13

There is no problem in my mind about that — this union cannot

14

discriminate.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

statement, if you wish.
MR. FISHER:

17

Thank you» Your Honor.

I merely want

18

to say this ease prevents the question when you are suing the

19

union for violation of that duty» and the plaintiff is a member,

20

even though he is a Negro, he is a member of the union, doesn't

21

he have the same obligation that other union members of the unior

2,2

have, of attempting to utilize his internal remedy, and the

23

question of the interpretation of this contract.

24

conceded —•

25

Q,

There is no

Why did the court say that the administrative remedy
37

was inadequate in Steele and in Tunstall — they said that part
of the reason was that it was not an unbiased tribunal, that
both parties who were accused of discriminating against the
plaintiff were sitting there deciding this dispute.

That was

part of the reason, was it not?
A.
Q

I think they did make that observation.
If the union who was sitting on one side was so

biased and so unreliable as not to furnish a decent administra­
tive remedys why would you suggest that the union would be un­
biased and would furnish a suitable remedy inside the union?
A.

Well, may I answer the question this way, Mr. Justice.

The court observed in those days that the adjustment board would
not permit individual plaintiffs to go before it.

It said in

over 400 cases —
Q

I understand that.

A,

Let me attempt to answer it directly, then, if I may,

and if I have not been direct.
In that case they were talking about the brief of the
union, of its duty of fair representation.

They said this is

not the claim that should go to the adjustment board.

I concede

they perhaps said it would not be a fair tribunal in weighing
the union’s duty because it was a union appointed representative
on the tribunal.
I am saying, and I hope I have been clear in this,
that the question of contract interpretation, pure and simple,
38

I

is the only question that I believe is properly referable to the
adjustment board.

And I am concedingj with Justice Marshall

and the other Justices on the court that the claim for breach of
the duty to treat members of a craft or class fairly is a claim
that is cognizable in the courts.
I think on that claim, which is a judicially
cognizable claim, since he is a member of the union, suing his
union,he should make some attempt to exhaust his remedies.

If

he had done that years ago he might have had immediate and
instantaneous relief.

He made no attempt and admits that he

made no attempt to exhaust his remedies.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
MR. FISHER:
MR. ACKER:

Thank you.

Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court, just a couple of remarks.

As I understand Mr. Fisher, he

is saying that these plaintiffs must have ppcne three separate
routes and that they must fragment their claim.

They must take

their union claim to the union, and their claim against the
company to the company grievance machinery and thereafter to
the Railroad Adjustment Board.
I do not think that could be done in two years.
Whether you did it simultaneously or not, at any rate he is
requiring a fragmentation.

He is saying there is. no right at

any time anywhere to sue the union and the company together
before one tribunal.

That ground was not In the motion to dismiss.

They

do not say in the motion to dismiss that you have no right in

3

this court to sue these two entities together.

4

heres as to footnote 4 of Conley against Gibson I think what

5

Mr. Fisher is saying is that footnote 4 went further than the

6

court needed to go to decide that particular case and therefore

7

it is dictum3 and he might be right there.

They say that

But I do think that what the court said in that
footnote 4 was carefully reasoned and was correct and should

10

become the law in a case where very clearly that question that

11

appeared in Hayes against Union Pacific is presented.

12

no question about that in this case.

One other thing —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

MR. ACKER:

There is

Make it brief.

One other thing.

The remark was made

16

and was made in brief that Mr. Dent had availed himself of the

17

remedy provided him -- or attempted to because he has been

18

unsuccessful thus far -- remedy under the Civil Rights Acts

IS

section 64, in which I am not involved.

20

I will say only one thing more.

This case here

21

certainly should not rise or fall on what one of the petitioners

22

here is doing in another case outside of the control of counsel

23

in this case.

24

after having been thrown out there as he was heres he will not

25

be entitled under the Civil Rights Act to damages \fhich is what

But if Mr. Dent is successful there ultimatelys

we are talking about when we talk about loss of seniority and

Job rights.

We are talking about money.
Thank you.
