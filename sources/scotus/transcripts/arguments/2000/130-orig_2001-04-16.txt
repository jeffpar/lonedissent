MR. STERN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Before the Court today is Maine's motion to

12

dismiss New Hampshire's complaint on res judicata grounds.

13

By its complaint, New Hampshire seeks to redraw its

14

boundaries --

Would you speak up a little, please?
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Maybe you can raise the podium and

it'll be closer.
MR. STERN:

I apologize.

By its complaint, New

20

Hampshire seeks with redraw its boundary with Maine by

21

moving the border from the middle of the river onto

22

Maine's shoreline along the Piscataqua River.

23

this Court held that the King's 1740 order permanently

24

fixed the boundary as the, quote, middle of the river,

in 1977, according to New Hampshire at the time in a brief

2

reproduced at 149a of New Hampshire's Appendix, that

3

decree, quote, contains specific findings and rulings and

4

sets forth the precise factual basis and legal principles

5

upon which it, the decree, is founded, closed quote.

6

Paragraph three of that decree sets forth the

7

pertinent provision of the 1740 King's order, the, quote,

8

middle of the river, closed quote, language.

9

Paragraph four of that decree is a ruling or

10

legal principle or finding that as used in the 1740 order,

11

quote, middle of the river, closed quote, means, not

12

surprisingly, middle of the Piscataqua River, middle river

13

of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.

14

QUESTION:

If we agree with your position, does

15

it become important or do we decide here, or does it

16

remain in dispute whether the middle means the geographic

17

middle or the middle of the channel?

18

MR. STERN:

No, paragraph four of the 1977

19

decree specifically held or noted or ruled that as used in

20

the 1740 order, quote, middle of the river, closed quote,

21

means middle of the main channel of navigation of the

22

Piscataqua River.

Of note, in the dissenting opinion written by

Justice White, it's noted that Maine strongly objected to

the proposed geographic midline of the special master

because of the substantial areas that Maine would lose to

8

New Hampshire in both the river and harbor and seaward

9

thereof.

Before this Court, Maine's Assistant Attorney

10

General argued, and it's at 104 to 105a of New Hampshire's

11

Appendix, that as much of an objection as Maine had to the

12

effect of the geographic line with respect to losing

territory off the coastline outside the harbor, Maine felt

much more -- a much greater prejudice from the effects

say, sure, we dismiss it because at least it isn't that

the low-water mark of the Maine shore, and not decide

whether it means the thalweg or the geographic middle of

MR. STERN:

Exactly, Your Honor.
We could do that, and that would mean

they could come back here a fourth time, I assume.

8

MR. STERN:

9

QUESTION:

I assume, yes.
But to do that we would just as much

10

have to rely upon the fact that the only thing which the

11

1977 decree technically held, mainly the outward line,

12

depended upon a calculation of what the line within the

13

river was.

14

while we're making that conclusion, we may as well go the

15

whole hog and accept what that decree said was, namely the

16

middle of the channel of navigation, rather than the

17

geographic middle.

We'd still have to make that conclusion.

And

Isn't that logical?

18

MR. STERN:

That's logical.

19

would result in the motion --

20

QUESTION:

Either approach

Well, I think the other approach is

21

illogical.

I mean, there's no basis for saying that we

22

can resolve this matter without deciding where it is in

23

the River, because the only thing the decree says is that

24

the line outward into the ocean depends upon the line

25

inward in the harbor and in the river, and it then goes on

to say, and that line is the middle of the navigation

channel, so it seems to me if we buy into the binding

3

effect of the decree, we buy into the middle of the

4

navigation channel.

5

MR. STERN:

We agree, Your Honor.

To the extent

6

that there's a suggestion that New Hampshire had no reason

7

or no incentive to press a claim to the shoreline back in

8

the 1970s, that is simply wrong.

the special master's report, New Hampshire filed

Indeed, in response to

10

exceptions seeking to move the middle of the river line

11

three hundred and fifty feet closer to Maine's shore.

12

the shoreline boundary was correct, if they pressed it

13

back then, the line would be moved not three hundred and

14

fifty feet but over half a mile onto Maine's shoreline,

15

obviously resulting in a substantial additional amount of

16

territory being in New Hampshire rather than Maine.

To the extent that there is the suggestion that

the middle of the river could possibly mean the shoreline,

that's defused by New Hampshire's own -- not only the

21

application in paragraph five, but also with respect to

New Hampshire's own pleadings at the time, own briefs,

as a possibility, because New Hampshire had the --

QUESTION:

New

Just as a matter of English usage, it

5

seems that when you're talking about the middle of the

6

river it would not be Maine's shoreline.

7

MR. STERN:

That's what we have been saying,

8

Your Honor.

We are here on a complaint seeking to in

9

effect that, quote, middle of the river, closed quote,

10

does not mean the middle of the river, but it gets more

11

peculiar because as a result of the decree in 1977, at

12

least the first mile of the river is laid out as the

13

middle of the river.

14

once we get up to the head of tide near Salmon Falls, we

15

jumped back into the middle of the river again, because

16

apparently the 1740 decree describes the boundary up there

17

as the middle of the Nuashanog.

18

New Hampshire appears to agree that

So the middle of the river means middle of the

19

river at the mouth.

Middle of the river means middle of

20

the river at its head, but middle of the river does not

21

mean middle of the river, according to New Hampshire, in

22

the middle section of the River.

23

peculiar, because it appears that New Hampshire concedes

24

that virtually all, if not all, of the islands on Maine's

side of the middle of the river, except the Shipyard

MR. STERN:

Not exactly, because back in the

2

1970s, as it has been explained previously, by necessity

3

it was essential to determine the location of the boundary

4

in the river and, in fact, the decree applied the

5

principle to a portion of the river.

6

as is obvious by comparing the United States' brief and

7

Maine's brief, that reasonable minds can differ as to

8

whether we're talking about a claim or an issue.

9

believe the claim preclusion and issue preclusion are

But we understand,

We

different paths that get to the same spot res judicata,

The difference is that claim

preclusion would favor you to the extent that it doesn't

whole claim.

Issue preclusion, it usually does

matter whether it was actually litigated.

Yes.

If it is a, quote, consent

decree, closed quote, and we would argue that this is not

21

the type of consent decree described in, for example,

22

independent determination that the 1740 King's Order and

24

not the proposed consent decree permanently fixed the

suggest that looking at, in particular paragraph four of

the 1977 decree, that that according to New Hampshire, as

we've related, is a specific finding or ruling or legal

1

That's another set of range lights where people who are

2

navigating would follow as well, going further up the

river.

4

to the consent decree is that it did define the channel as

5

the middle of the river, as the middle of the main channel

of navigation, and it extended that line up into the river

7

to a considerable decree.

8
9

But the important point to recognize with regard

QUESTION:

When you say that definition of the

middle of the river, the main channel -- is that the

10

thalweg, or just the channel that is in fact used by the

11

ships?

12

MR. MINEAR:

I think in actuality it is the

13

channel that is in fact used by the ships.

14

White pointed out in his dissent in No. 64 Original, the

15

thalweg would normally follow the deepest channel or where

16

the current is fastest, and so it would not necessarily be

17

a straight line.

18

and as the line that is drawn show in here, they

19

compromised their meaning of the consent --their meaning

20

of the 1740 Order by using where the ships actually

travel.

of course boundaries are ambulatory, they move, and maybe

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LESLIE J. LUDTKE

11

Thank you, Mr. Minear.

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MS. LUDTKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to start by framing what appears to be

12

the central issue before the Court, and that issue is as

13

follows: Maine and the United States argue that New

14

Hampshire is bound by its position in the 1976 case

15

concerning the meaning of the 1740 boundary decree. That

16

case involved the determination of the State's lateral

17

marine boundary that ran between the mouths of Portsmouth

18

Harbor and Gosport Harbor.

19

Now the boundary decree in question which was

20

issued as an order in council in 1740, describes the

21

boundary as follows, and I will paraphrase the

22

description.

23

Piscataqua Harbor and up the middle of the river into the

24

river Newichwannock and through the same to the furthest

25

head and it divides the Isle of Shoals.

The boundary passes up through the mouth of

1

New Hampshire agreed that three phrases in the 1740 decree

2

had relevance in determining the location of their lateral

3

marine boundary, and those phrases were as follows. Phrase

4

number one: The boundary passes up through the mouth of

5

the harbor.

6

river.

Phrase two: It passes up the middle of the

And phrase three, it divides the Isle of Shoals.

7

Since that time, New Hampshire has determined

8

for good historical reasons after a searching review of

9

original records and maps that the phrase up the middle of

10

the river has no relevance to determining the location of

11

the boundary in the harbor and the tidal portions of the

12

Piscataqua River.

13

Maine and the United States claim that the

14

stipulation in 1976 preludes New Hampshire from arguing in

15

this case that that phrase, up the middle of the river,

16

has no application to the location of the boundary in

17

Portsmouth Harbor.

18

precluded from arguing that, because that phrase, up the

19

middle of the river, was not essential to this Court's

20

jurisdiction to enter judgment approving the consent

decree.

Excuse me.

I meant it's our

the 1976 order issued by this Court does stand for the

5

proposition that the States have broad latitude in coming

6

to agreement as to the location of a boundary when the

7

underlying boundary instrument is imprecise, and I think

8

the second corollary of that is this Court need not

9

adjudicate the actual true and correct historical meaning

10

of the underlying decree in approving such an agreement of

11

the parties.

12

And I think later on in the Multistate Tax

13

Commission that we've cited in our brief, in that case the

14

Court explicitly cited this case as well as the Virginia

15

v. Tennessee case for the proposition that an approval of

16

an agreement relative to a boundary line didn't implicate

17

the Commerce Clause when the underlying instrument was

18

imprecise.

19

So I think it goes to the point of whether this

20

Court could have approved that consent agreement entered

21

into between New Hampshire and Maine, had that stipulation

22

not been there, regarding the meaning of the phrase middle

23

of the river.

dissent that was raised, because there is no legal or

5

QUESTION:

Well, I think the Court would be

6

surprised to learn that the real disagreement between the

7

majority and the dissent in the case was not over where

8

the line was, but rather over whether you can accept the

9

parties' stipulation or not.

There is no indication in

10

the writings as I recall it that that was the difference

11

between the majority and the dissent.

12

majority and the dissent understood that they had to be

13

determining what the line was, giving some allowance to

14

the parties' concessions, but that the Court had a

15

responsibility to determine the line.

16

to indicate that, and you're telling us that the basic

17

distinction is that the majority just thought that they

18

had no responsibility to come to an independent

19

determination.

20

I think both the

Both opinions seem

MS. LUDTKE:

middle.

2

used, and raised questions about the legal authority of

3

those devices to determine a 1740 boundary.

4

New Hampshire at oral argument told the Court

5

this decision is arbitrary.

It's based on administrative

6

convenience, we want a straight boundary line.

7

reason why that dogleg went up into the harbor instead of

8

emerged from a closing line is that Maine insisted at that

9

time that a closing line not be placed across the harbor

And the

10

so that it could take advantage of the reservation that

11

this Court had allowed it in the United States v. Maine

12

case to litigate the legal extent of its seaward

13

boundaries.

14

So this was not a case where the parties

15

intended to negotiate or to conclude a boundary in the

16

harbor.

17

Maine's interests in reserving its right to litigate the

18

question of the legal extent of its seaward boundaries.

19

Moreover, as the State has submitted to the Court, the

20

Solicitor General at that time was expressing grave

21

concern regarding the question of whether this would

22

implicate rights in the United States v. Maine case by

23

establishing a ruling that colonial charters had a legal

24

effect in determining boundaries in the marginal sea.

Your Honor, the history of the

There was not

a searching historical inquiry into what the phrase, up

middle of the river, which you agreed to, mean the

2

low-water mark on the Maine shore?

3

MS. LUDTKE:

Your Honor, our position on the

4

term, up the middle of the river, means that -- we take

5

the position that as historically used that was intended

6

to describe the course of the boundary up the main part of

7

the Piscataqua River, and it was intended to direct that

8

the line that proceeded north two degrees west went from

9

the main tributary that was that the main feeder stream

10

into the headwaters of the Salmon Falls River, and we have

11

shown through the 1763 boundary proceedings and the 1828

12

boundary proceedings that that is how that term was used.

13

We do not think that that term is properly

14

applied to the harbor boundary.

In 1973, both Maine and

15

New Hampshire and the special master all thought that term

16

had some relevance to the harbor boundary, with the best

17

of intentions, because there had not been a searching

18

historical inquiry into what that language meant, and it

was an easy mistake to make.

what they knew, and they did it with the best of

2

intentions.

3

QUESTION:

All right, so that's what worrying

4

me, that when I read this, until I heard you actually, I

5

thought, well, gee, I don't understand what this argument

6

is, because the reading of this decree seems to say when

7

you take the middle of the river or middle of the harbor

8

or middle of anything, it seems to take the main channel

9

of navigation divided down the river.

Now, you've read it

10

closely and you say that this part of it wasn't actually

11

at issue.

12

reopening boundary decrees, it seems to me we're going to

13

get into a lot of trouble because there may be a lot of

14

boundary decrees among States that have parts that, if you

15

really looked at them, they might not have been perfect or

16

perfectly described.

even though it was all done by mistake and with the best

18

of intentions and so forth.

It wasn't literally decided, because

it wasn't directly an issue in the case, I assume.

The applicability of this phrase

2

was an assumption that the parties brought to the

3

negotiations, and the boundary was set out based upon

4

those negotiations. There was no actual -- no actual

5

adjudication of whether this phrase applied.

6

of the boundary at issue was not the harbor boundary.

7

There is no intent to make this apply, that was clear.

8

And I think that the most troublesome aspect, and that's

9

why I addressed this question first, is whether this Court

The portion

10

could have entered the consent decree in 1976 had the

11

parties' stipulation pertaining to the meaning of the

12

middle of the river not been there.

13

could have entered it, because the boundary description

14

describes the boundary as passing up through the mouth of

15

Piscataqua Harbor, and it would have been reasonable,

16

given that description of the boundary, for the parties to

17

agree upon a location in the middle.

that neither the application nor the meaning of the

adjudicated in 1976.

MR. STERN:

The second one, which is the one

that the dissent addressed, was where in the river was the

3

boundary because depending upon where it was -- geographic

4

middle, thalweg, or the Maine shoreline, it would

5

determine how much territory was in each State.

6

suggest that New Hampshire didn't have the incentive to

7

claim a shoreline on Maine's -- in Maine, I mean, borders

8

on implausible because it would have resulted in hundreds

9

if not thousands of additional acres of territory being in

10

New Hampshire rather than Maine.

11

Hampshire filed special exceptions to the special master's

12

report and argued to this Court that the boundary should

13

be moved over a bit, three hundred and fifty feet in the

14

middle of the river, to get some additional territory.

15

shoreline boundary would have increased that manyfold, so

16

New Hampshire had the incentive to press a claim to the

17

shoreline boundary.

You'll recall that New

Its failure to do so precludes it from doing so now.
And the reason we have these specific findings,

rulings and legal principles according to New Hampshire,

as they explained in the 1970s, was to avoid the Vermont

v. New York problem where there was a decree without

findings, without an adjudication of any issues.

of that concern that this decree might not be approved,

these specific findings and rulings and legal principles

were laid out here, and they are made without reservation.
