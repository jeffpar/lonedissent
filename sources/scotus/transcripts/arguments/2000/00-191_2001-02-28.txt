ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Twenty-five years ago in Buckley this Court held

16

that limits on campaign contributions can be more easily

17

justified under the First Amendment than limits on

18

campaign expenditures, and noted that a coordinated

19

expenditure, such as one made at the candidate's request,

20

is treated as a contribution for this purpose.

21

Nothing in the First Amendment requires an

22

exemption from these rules for political parties. Congress

23

recognized that parties are different from other political

24

actors and gave them somewhat higher contribution limits

25

and much higher limits on coordinated expenditures.

1

QUESTION:

I think that you do have a problem in

2

sustaining this part of the congressional act because the

3

basis for sustaining the limits on contributions is the

4

corruption rationale that has been in our cases for, you

5

know, 50, 60 years.

6

me to see how receiving a contribution would corrupt a

7

political party.

8
9

But it's very difficult, at least for

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Political parties present the

risk -- a risk of the corruption that justifies limits on

10

contributions and coordinated expenditures in two ways.

11

First, because they can receive contributions in much

12

larger amounts than other actors and then redistribute

13

them to candidates, they provide a conduit for other

14

actors to circumvent the contribution limits of the act.

15

Other donors can make large contributions to the party

16

which, though not technically, literally earmarked, and

17

therefore not in violation of the specific earmarking

18

provision of the statute, nevertheless through informal

19

and well understood arrangements find their way through

20

the party to the candidate and create the same risk or

21

appearance of corruption as a direct contribution to the

22

candidate.

23

QUESTION:

Well, if those informal arrangements

24

are that actually this money is given to the party but we

25

know you're going to give it to candidate X, certainly the

Congress can prohibit that.

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Perhaps it already has.

Congress has prohibited

3

earmarking, but the Court recognized in Buckley itself

4

that a prohibition on earmarking cannot reach, cannot be

5

effective to reach the whole problem of, in effect, using

6

an intermediary to exceed the limits, and the reason is

7

for one thing an earmarking arrangement requires something

8

more rigid than what would usually happen.

9

not earmarking, for example, if -- within the meaning of

I mean, it's

10

the statute, if a contributor understands that there is a

11

good likelihood that the money will be passed by the party

12

to the candidate, although there might be reasons why it

13

would not.

14

has the prospect of being regarded by the candidate and by

15

the donor as virtually a contribution.

16

In that case it's not earmarking, but it still

QUESTION:

Let me get this straight.

I can

17

understand why there's, you know, corruption if the donor

candidate says I'll vote for your bill.

individuals to spend $100,000 in their own advertising for

21

this candidate, and it says at the bottom of the ad, you

22

know, paid for by Schwartz, and the candidate knows

23

Schwartz has bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of

24

television advertising, that is perfectly okay, right?

QUESTION:

But if Schwartz gives $100,000 to the

3

Democratic Party, we're suddenly worried that the

4

candidate is going to be corrupted because Schwartz gave

5

$100,000?

6

fanciful to think that the one situation presents, you

7

know, an opportunity for corruption and the other doesn't.

8

You're much better off if you want to corrupt Schwartz,

9

spending the money on an advertisement that says

11

I can't understand that. That seems to me so

presented, you know, presented by XYZ Corporation.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, the Court in Buckley had

12

to balance a number of different concerns in arriving at

13

its distinction between independent expenditures, which

14

will certainly often please the candidate, but which it

15

regarded as sufficiently important in First Amendment

16

terms so that limiting them to protect against possible

17

indirect corruption was not permissible on the one hand,

18

and contributions, direct contributions to the candidate,

Now, the additional point that I was addressing

MS. UNDERWOOD:

QUESTION:

The section --

And you talk about the significant

7

First Amendment value of an individual being able to spend

8

his money on an ad for the candidate, there is significant

9

First Amendment value in that.

It is not clear to me that

10

there is any less First Amendment value in people being

11

able to band together in political parties and in unison

12

support political candidates.

13

First Amendment value, too, and you're saying they can't

14

do that.

15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

16

QUESTION:

That's a very important

Well, no.

Well, you're saying they can do it to

17

a very limited degree, although rich individuals can take

18

out their own television ads, a party which gets

19

contributions from Joe Sixpack in five and ten dollar

20

amounts cannot do that to support a candidate.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No, the party can do it in

unlimited amounts when it is making the same kind of

QUESTION:

MS. UNDERWOOD:

we discuss this at pages 28 and 29 of our brief, several

2

Senators made -- expressly observed that a party can act

3

as a conduit for an individual who has reached his

contribution limit.

QUESTION:

So the danger is that contributors to

political parties are using those contributions to somehow

7

corrupt the candidates?

8

MS. UNDERWOOD:

9

QUESTION:

10

Correct.

And that's kind of an indirect sort

of a thing?

11

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's right.

That the

12

anti-earmarking provision itself is evidence of Congress'

13

concern about that, about the evasion of the limits on

14

donors.

15
16

QUESTION:

And you say the earmarking provision

isn't sufficient?

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

And where do we look for this

evidence of concern?

To stray remarks by some Members of

Well, there are remarks by

Members of Congress.

There is, better perhaps even than

candidate C by passing it through B.

QUESTION:

But you think that's not sufficient?

4

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

And this Court

5

said it wasn't sufficient in Buckley, and observed that

6

that's part of why -- part of what justifies the limit on

7

individual contributions in a campaign, the total limit,

8

9

QUESTION:

Is the argument, General Underwood,

10

it is not that the party is corrupted, I take it, because

11

that would seem just fatuous, but the party is kind of a

12

means to corrupting the candidate himself?

13

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

There are two arguments

14

about the risk of corruption.

15

that I'm talking bout is that the party is a means -- that

16

the contribution limits on individual donors are justified

17

as a means of preventing corruption and the risk of

18

corruption donor to candidate, and that the party, as an

19

intermediary, can facilitate, can essentially undermine

20

that mechanism that the individuals can exceed their

21

contribution limits.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

MS. UNDERWOOD:

would agree that it -- that the function of the party is

if it were prohibited from making independent

10

There is no limit on its independent

QUESTION:

Coordinated expenditures have --

It's a very strange, very strange

calculus.

5

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Coordinated expenditure has a

6

technical meaning here, and it doesn't violate the

7

prohibition on coordinated expenditure for the party to do

8

something that is consistent with the candidate's

9

campaign.

10

What the coordinated expenditure prohibition was

11

designed to prohibit was the candidate essentially paying

12

the media bills for the candidate, and the record contains

13

evidence that the over -- that the predominant forum that

14

coordinated expenditures take is exactly that.

15

QUESTION:

What if, what if the party consults

the candidate and says, you know, we're thinking of

statutory term, but the Federal Election Commission has

10

been developing regulations to try and make more precise

clear from the outset of the statute that the purpose of

No, but what I'm saying is, once you

as what you're trying to prohibit?

6

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No.

Although these things are

7

all a matter of degree, it is the case, I mean, it's -- it

8

is the case that Congress thought that contributions over

9

a certain limit created a potential for corruption, and

10

that to make that enforceable, it had to prohibit as well

11

or limit as well things that are the functional equivalent

12

of contributions, such as --

13

QUESTION:

But it's also the case that the

contrary to the whole idea of the truth that the First

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

It has been observed

2

before that Congress perhaps -- well, that Congress is

3

fully familiar with the practices of campaign expenditures

4

and campaign fund-raising and with the risks and benefits

5

that various forms of fund-raising have and that having

6

evaluated all of those risks and benefits and taken

7

guidance from these courts, the distinctions that this

8

Court has drawn, its effort to, to make those judgments is

9

entitled at least to some, some credit.

10

QUESTION:

Do we owe any deference to common

11

sense in recognizing that when Congress draws up campaign

12

funding legislation, it is more likely to draw up a system

13

that favors incumbents and is it not true that this rule

14

of course favors incumbents because the one who suffers

15

the most when he can't get significant funding from the

party is the new candidate, the unknown face who is

running against an incumbent?

on what donors can give to a candidate, they will be

2

trying to find ways to get around it, and one good way is

3

to use intermediaries that are not subject to the same

4

limits and that Congress recognized that and attempted to

5

address it without crippling other important functions by

6

putting a limit on the contributions, by not prohibiting,

7

but putting a limit on the contributions and coordinated

8

expenditures that parties can make to candidates.

9

There is a second corruption concern, and that

10

is the concern, not that the party would act as a conduit,

11

but that the party leaders in charge of dispensing funds

12

would, in effect, exact -- pay for votes, would themselves

13

tie money to legislative actions.

14

evidence in the record of that happening, but it is the

case that if a candidate's own family can be subject to a

Yes, it does.

does this case, in that coordinated expenditures are, in

that they are not, then it would be decided --

QUESTION:

But your corruption rationale is much

11

less if you're talking about a big wheel or, you know, a

13

is the fat cat is going to get something in return, but

14

the idea that a political party donating to a candidate is

Well, as I suggested, it does,

however, I think, have the same ring to say that a

19

political party can facilitate the very transaction that

20

you were just describing; that is, the fat cat now not

21

giving money directly to the candidate because he's barred

22

from doing so, but giving it to the party to transmit to

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

MR. BARAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8

may it please the Court, the statute before you makes it a

9

crime for a political party to send one letter to every

10

voter in the State if the candidate requested that letter

11

or collaborated in its preparation.

12

The issue before the Court is whether this

13

clear, direct, and substantial infringement on political

14

parties' First Amendment rights is justified, and based on

15

this Court's precedent, the legislative record, and the

16

factual record developed in this lengthy case, the answer

17

must be no.

18

The record demonstrates that this limit directly

19

and substantially suppresses political party speech and

20

does not prevent any discernible form of corruption.

21

Moreover, this particular Federal limit stands in contrast

22

to the majority of State laws which may restrict

it is, surely there would be a single instance of this

MR. BARAN:

The practical effect of striking

down these limits in addition to giving parties their

discretion as to how best to spend their limited resources

18

is that I believe the other practical effect is that it

19

will provide an incentive for political parties to raise

20

more hard money, which is presumably the beneficial money

21

that we have in our process.

22

Right now, there is actually a perverse effect

of these limits, rather than preventing corruption,

MR. BARAN:

substantive and historical difference.

One of the

11

distinguishing features of the legislative record going

back to Congress' consideration of campaign finance reform

in the early 1970s is that while there is a great deal of

1973 or 1974 at a time they were considering a bill which

provided for no private contributions in general elections

public financing proposition, somebody got up and said,

resources and we want to make sure that there is not

excessive spending so we're going to devise this formula,

3

which is more generous than we are providing to anyone. In

4

fact, it's generous exponentially because we're telling

individuals and political committees they cannot

contribute to these candidates at all, and that's the

genesis of this limitation.

We discussed that in 1996 before this Court that

that supports spending limits generally, but I don't know

that it is, it is or was meant to be the exhaustive

rationale for a distinction between coordinated and

uncoordinated because if that were the only issue there

19

wouldn't have been any distinction.

20

MR. BARAN:

21

QUESTION:

Well -A spending limit is a spending limit.

22

And if you're distinguishing between coordinated and

contrary, that the policy is exactly the intuitive

judgment that was behind the original hypo of Justice

2

Breyer's.

3

MR. BARAN:

I believe that if that were the

point, in the consideration of campaign finance over a

period of literally decades would have gotten up and said

MR. BARAN:

15

QUESTION:

No.

They did it to limit spending.

They don't need to distinguish

17

they're concerned with?

18

MR. BARAN:

No.

Because, and this may explain a

19

little bit of that dichotomy in the statute today that we

20

have that contribution limit of $5,000 to candidates from

21

a political party and yet we have this special provision

QUESTION:

Now there are.

Are you saying that

the rationale for what happened here was just

4

and said, hey, we don't need this now?

5

Nobody thought about it?

MR. BARAN:

Nobody went back

I believe that the rationale for

6

this provision today is the original rationale, the entire

7

statute, this provision was transferred verbatim after

8

this Court's decision in Buckley from the criminal code of

9

Title 18 into the existing statutory provision of Title 2.

10

And other than the report language that was noted in the

11

Government's brief regarding the effect of this provision

12

after Buckley, there is no other congressional utterance

13

that I'm aware of regarding the purpose of the statute.

14

This really is a relic from Congress' effort to basically

15

control spending in the entire political process.

16

There is one final point I would like to bring

17

to the Court's attention.

There has been discussion about

18

Congress' treatment of family members and there is an

19

intimation that perhaps there was no record or legislative

20

record regarding Congress' actions in that regard.

21

noted in our reply brief in 1996 that there is legislative

22

record of concern back in 1974 about wealthy family

23

individuals contributing to candidates of their family.

24

There was even the example noted of concern that Nelson

25

Rockefeller's mother had contributed one and a half

We

million dollars to his campaign in 1968, and there are

2

some floor statements by legislators as well.

3

not accurate to say that Congress did not have any

4

expression of concern about family members, as opposed to

5

political parties, and that record was presented to this

6

Court in Buckley when it considered all of those statutes

7

at that time.

9

So it is

I would also like to address the question about
what is the definition of coordination.

That is in the

10

statute, Section 441A.

11

an expenditure into a contribution if there has been a

12

request or a suggestion, if there has been consultation

13

with the candidate and I don't believe it's at all clear

14

whether the Government would not restrict a political

15

party's spending if they simply went to a candidate as

16

suggested by Justice Scalia and said, well, will this help

17

you or will this hurt you?

18

enforcement that suggests that at least as far as the

19

commission is concerned that would constitute coordination

20

and therefore would be either subject to our limit or

21

somehow barred under the contribution limits.

are no further questions, I have covered everything I

intended to cover.

Well, you just said there is nothing

13

Congressman ever said anything like that.

14

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, at pages 28 and 29 of our

15

brief, we quote some legislative history.

I think my

16

colleague discounts it because it was at a time when the

17

structure of the statute was somewhat different so the

18

evasion and the conduit that was possible was somewhat

19

different but it was nevertheless then, and is now, aimed

20

at preventing parties from enabling individuals to avoid

21

their limits.

22

that the point of this is to prevent an indirect

23

contribution by a candidate -- by a contributor to a

candidate going through the party.

The coordinated expenditures are like

contributions and it was the premise of Buckley, over some

3

objection to be sure, that they have a greater potential

4

for corruption than independent expenditures.

5

for parties and for political action committees, as well

6

as for individuals, and it's true for fat cat

7

contributors, as well as for small contributors, so the

8

right that's being claimed here, the constitutional right

9

here to unlimited coordinated expenditures is, in effect,

10
11

That's true

a claim of right to unlimited contributions.
The Colorado Republican Party isn't making that

12

argument, but it seems to follow from their argument

13

because parties -- and the reason why, although parties

14

are different from other kinds of actors in the system,

15

they nevertheless need to be subjected to some limits, is

16

precisely because, as intermediaries, they can serve to

defeat the other limits of the statute.
