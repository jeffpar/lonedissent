ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. SMITH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. SMITH:

Mr.

Chief Justice.

May it please

6

the Court.

I think my first task here is to show you that

7

what the Texas Court did was contrary to or an

8

unreasonable application of your previous decision in

9

Penry in this case, and I believe that your decision in

10

Penry or Penry One as we call it in our brief was fairly

11

clear in saying that as to this man, a retarded man like

12

this with a life long history of really gruesome child

13

abuse where virtually his whole case is based on the

14

retardation and the horrible child abuse, that the three

15

questions of the old Texas statutory scheme just don't

16

work or at least they do not work unless you take the

17

first question which asks whether the defendant acted

18

deliberately and give "deliberately" a definition.

19

It would have to be a rather unusual definition of

20

deliberately that will tell the jury, contrary to the

21

normal meaning of the word, that you can find that conduct

22

resulting from child

23

child abuse, although that's perhaps a stretch, could be a

24

basis for a finding that the defendant did not act

25

deliberately.

When you summarized in Grand v Collins the Penry

2

holding, you said and I'm quoting from page 474 of 506 US

Reports, you said that "in Penry it was impossible to give

QUESTION: It was impossible there under the

11

instructions that were there given, but the instructions

12

here given made it very clear that if you considered the

13

mental deficiency to be a mitigating factor you should

answer one of the three questions "no".

how the jury could have misunderstood it.

simplify it.

Your Honor, and there is no one of whom a jury is likely

QUESTION:

--

How about this sentence: if you

17

determine when giving mitigating effect to the mitigating

18

evidence, if any, that a life sentence as reflected by a

19

negative finding to the issue under consideration rather

20

than a death sentence is an appropriate response to the

21

personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding

22

should be given to one of the special issues.

23

MR. SMITH:

I respectfully submit that's much

24

less than clear, Your Honor, and becomes even less clear

25

if you read the preceding sentence.

The preceding

circumstances in this case you must decide how much weight

3

they deserve, if any, and therefore give effect and

consideration to them in assessing defendant's personal

culpability at the time you answer the special issue."

MR. SMITH: No, it wasn't.

these three issues.

MR. SMITH:

Done by Joe Price, who's a very able

14

man but he was doing it back in March and the jury didn't

15

deliberate until July.

16

has held that an improper instruction or even an ambiguous

17

instruction was clarified by voir dire questions asked

18

four months previously or by voir dire questions.

think that works.

To me the important fact was not the

pay somewhat more attention to the piece of paper that

Well, what is

instruction was the Supreme Court has said this mitigating

2

evidence doesn't come under any one of the three, so in

3

effect, as counsel said in the voir dire, I'm creating a

4

fourth special issue and if you find mental incapacity,

5

say no to any one of the three and I think that's what

6

this sentence says.

7

MR. SMITH:

I submit it would have been

8

significantly less confusing if they had indeed put a

9

fourth question on the piece of paper Your Honor, but I

10

also want to call your attention in the instruction to the

11

words "as reflected by a negative finding to the issue

12

under consideration".

13

if they have any meaning at all, if the possible defense

14

of them is if they have no meaning at all, that's the best

15

that can be said for them, but if they have a meaning they

16

mean that you cannot give effect to the mitigating

evidence unless you can reflect it to

negative finding to the issue under consideration,

19

whatever that is.

I suggest to you that those words,

5

QUESTION:

--

How would you have done it, Mr.

Smith.

Do you think the judge had authority to override

7

the Texas statute which only provided for these three

questions and simply invent a fourth of his own?

10

MR. SMITH:

I don't think he had authority.

I

think you'd already done that for him Your Honor?

11

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think we created a

12

fourth question under Texas statutory law.

13

we said is that the mental incapacity has to be one of the

14

factors the jury is allowed to take into account and I

15

think it's a perfectly reasonable way for the judge to say

16

find no to one of the Texas special issues in the statute,

I think it's fair to characterize

what you did in Penry and Penry One, Justice Scalia, as

Penry and when the statute is held unconstitutional of

23

course the state court on retrial need not observe it.

13

whether it would have been successful, to use the jury

also proposed several instructions that would

MR. SMITH:

It is true that Roberts was

Roberts I think is that it's intolerable to tell the jury

to disregard what they are being told to do.

QUESTION:

Roberts had a reason and the reason

that Roberts gave why it was intolerable was that the jury

was just invited on no evidence whatever to move the

offense downward which would have been the exact thing

that Furman objected to.

he has the further authority to go ahead and invent

MR. SMITH:

I guess I would answer by saying if

the Texas statute has been held unconstitutional as

applied then it's perfectly appropriate for a Texas judge

not to implement it.

Let me try to talk briefly about my second task, if I

can,

3

which is to show that the

report was contrary to or an unreasonable application of

this Court's decision in Estelle v Smith.

permitted under Buchanan against Kentucky.

Based on the

I think it is

The Peebles report which is

10

at page 60 of the joint appendix served one function in

11

this case for the prosecution and that was to introduce

12

one sentence which says it is

released from custody that he would be dangerous to other

summarizes perfectly what the state was trying to prove on

its affirmative case of future dangerousness.

The state does

error.

I do not see how you can think an error was

2

harmless or the admission of a piece of evidence was

3

harmless when you look at what the prosecution did with

4

that piece of evidence, and that is at page 7 of our

5

brief. This is the last page, the last paragraph of the

6

prosecution's rebuttal summation.

7

this is what he saved to have ringing in the jury's ears

8

when they went out to deliberate.

9

Doctor Felix Peebles who found that he was sane.

This is the climax,

"He was examined by
He knew

10

the difference between right and wrong and he was

11

competent to stand trial."

12

made an additional finding that was really out of the

13

ordinary and I have never seen this in any kind of a

14

report. I'm quoting the prosecutor, closing out.

15

added it, he said that "it is my further professional

16

opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from

17

custody that he would be dangerous to other persons".

18

question of course comes why

19

that report so much?

20

dangerousness was not a tough issue for them, but I think

21

the Curt must remember that the jury wasn't just answering

22

yes or no to the second issue.

23

Penry the jury had to take into account had to weigh the

24

mitigating evidence against the perfectly horrible and

very real evidence of man's dangerousness.

You don't weigh the one against the

regarding how culpable he was.

MR. SMITH:

I beg to differ.

Of course it would

not affect the jury's determination of how culpable he was

I do think it was important not just whether the jury

at the man and said this man is so dangerous I've got to

to the jury.

But I still don't see how that means

that this one sentence is so controlling that all the

to decide whether it was harmless error.

21

MR. SMITH:

I'm not saying it can't be looked at

but I think to decide whether it's harmless you have to

say how different is the case without it, different enough

that the prosecutor would not have had this key point.

the Court. Unlike Penry One, where no instruction was

give effect to a moral determination of this man's

20

personal culpability such that if they felt despite

21

literal answers to the three questions that Texas submits

answer yes. I mean that's such an odd posture in a sense

2

it's very awkward to say the least.

3

MR. TAYLOR:

We submit that it is not awkward

4

because of the actual words contained in the instruction

5

as Justice Scalia read out loud in that particular

6

instruction that was given, and I might add, Justice

Ginsburg, that instruction was attached to the three

again in writing but once that instruction was put

together, it made clear that to give a vehicle to this

of yes.

not unconstitutional to shape and to structure that jury's

2

consideration of all of the evidence so that they can make

3

a life choice.

4

QUESTION:

Isn't the difficulty in this case

5

that what you describe as the structure is in effect an

6

instruction that says you may act irrationally and as

7

against that possibility there were at least two avenues

8

open to the court that would have allowed the jury to do

9

just what Penry One required and to do it in a rational

10

way?

11

say "even though you answer yes to one, two and three you

12

also have a responsibility to consider mitigating evidence

13

and if you do so, you may in fact answer this fourth

14

question" however it might be structured "in a way that

15

says don't impose the death penalty any way".

16

One way would have been to add a fourth question and

A second rational way to do it -- I don't how easy it

17

would have been but I assume it could have been done,

18

would have been with a definition of deliberately and the

jury that a person of some degree of retardation simply

court decided to do it in an irrational way saying even if

1

all the evidence leads to a yes answer, you can say no any

2

way, and that's to me the nub of the problem here because

3

if as we have repeatedly said the jury is supposed to

4

engage in some kind of a reasoned moral process, this was

5

not a reasoned moral process; it was an irrational

6

process.

7

What's your response to that?
MR. TAYLOR:

Any of those three would be

8

constitutional.

This Court has never told the state of

9

Texas that in structuring and shaping the jury's

10

consideration of all of the relevant consideration of

11

evidence including mitigating evidence, it must choose a

12

particular way to

QUESTION:

No, but it has

-- this is the point

14

of my question, it has repeatedly told everybody that the

15

process of arriving at a determination or a choice between

16

life and death is supposed to be a reasoned moral process

17

and it seems to me by definition inconsistent with that

18

standard to say that it suffices to tell the jury that you

19

may behave in a totally irrational way.

20

MR. TAYLOR:

We think that it was a reasonable

21

choice and certainly a reasonable application under the

22

Edpa standard for this trial judge to pick an instruction

that in order for an instruction on deliberateness to work

That's flatly inconsistent with the

command in the special issue that because at least ten

MR. TAYLOR:

We submit that it is not flatly

MR. TAYLOR:

The charge and the accompanying

2

instructions is found in volume three of the joint

3

appendix beginning at page 672, Justice Ginsburg, and that

4

charge does a couple of things. It not only tells the jury

5

to take into consideration all of the evidence but it goes

6

further and it tells them that they should look at all of

7

the mitigating circumstances and including in that look at

8

the defendant's character, record, circumstances of the

9

crime, and then they have to look at a broader principle

10

and that is what is this defendant's personal culpability

11

not limiting it to only the question of deliberateness or

12

future dangerousness or provocation

13

QUESTION:

3

so what should I do as a juror if I thought that a life

and the mental retardation, but I didn't think a life

questions was appropriate, what am I supposed to do?

You must follow your oath.

The

oath includes the instruction and under that circumstance

10

morally if you believe life instead of death is the right

11

answer, you answer no.

I believe a life sentence is appropriate but I don't

believe a life sentence as reflected by a negative answer

to a finding to the issue under consideration; I don't

believe it is appropriate as reflected by deliberation; I

QUESTION:

MR. TAYLOR:

Counsel, Your time is far off still.
Under the Estelle claim what was

4

clearly established and remembering of course that we're

5

on federal habeas review, Edpa standard applies, what was

6

clearly demonstrated in Estelle, two things, first that

7

request for an examination of the defendant was not made

8

by the defendant or his counsel but rather was ordered by

9

the Court.

Second, in Estelle we learned that there was

10

no attempt at all to introduce the mind-set or the

11

psychiatric evidence in that case, and so it was a

12

reasonable application of Estelle for the Court of

13

Criminal Appeals in Texas to rule that Estelle was

14

distinguishable and not clearly applicable to this case.

15

In this case not only are we dealing with a request

16

by defense counsel, we're also dealing with offensive use

17

of psychiatric evidence by defense counsel.

18

in the record when Dr. Price, their expert witness on

19

mental retardation and child abuse and its effects, he

testified that he relied on the Doctor Peebles report.

MR. TAYLOR:

Of course, we contend that Estelle

2

is not applicable but if you believe that Buchanan applies

3

and the only way that we can win is to argue that it's

4

solely and exclusively rebuttal, the answer to that

5

question that demonstrates why we still prevail and why

6

the court below was correct is that in the Peebles Report

7

there is a statement made that the reason that this

8

gentleman doesn't learn from his mistakes is not because

9

of mental retardation, not because of child abuse but

10
11

rather because he is a psychotic individual.
He has an anti-social personality disorder.

He's a

12

psychopath and so therefore it's very important in

13

determining personal culpability and whether he should get

14

death instead of life to be able to demonstrate from the

15

prosecution's point of view this man is not any less

16

culpable because his violent behavior, his future

17

dangerousness is not the result of mental retardation.

18

It's the result of the fact that he's a psychopath and

19

therefore he is not any less culpable than any one else

20

absent such evidence of mitigating circumstances.

21

Justice Ginsburg, it is for that reason that we still

22

prevail even if you believe that under Buchanan and its

23

rebuttal exception that is all that we have here.

rebuttal to what they were saying in the punishment phase,

10

what Dr. Price was saying is that I'm not focusing on the

11

future dangerousness part but what Dr. Price was saying is

12

we don't think he's culpable and the reason we don't think

he's culpable is because he can't control himself, he

declining to impose the death penalty.

12

This is how the Penry One holding was characterized

13

in subsequent opinions of this Court including Graham and

14

Sapple and others, and it's true that Penry One discussed

15

some of the ways that Texas might comply with this

16

principle but it did not clearly establish that these

17

additional instructions either had to include a separate

18

special issue or had to expressly tell the jury that it

could answer no to a special issue even if the literal

In fact in

case and Penry One is that here unlike Penry One, the

2

trial court actually gave a very extended instruction on

3

the subject of mitigating evidence as Mr. Taylor has

4

discussed earlier.

5

there was no corresponding instruction given in Penry One

and so the only question -- so clearly this case is

distinguishable from that and clearly the lower courts at

One.

That was instruction number four and

Whether they did so reasonably is the real question

10

of the day and I think on that point it's significant

11

although not dispositive that of the ten state judges and

12

the four federal judges who address this issue on the

13

merits, not one of them concluded that the instruction was

14

an unreasonable application of Penry One.

15

There was one judge in the Fifth Circuit who

16

concluded that it was incorrect but again under Williams

17

versus Taylor it's not enough that the application be

18

incorrect and especially not less than perfect.

19

even if it would have been better to add a fourth special

20

issue, that doesn't make the Texas decision unreasonable

21

especially in light of Boyd and Sapple which say that the

22

states retain their right to structure and shape the

-- I don't

case under Roberts because the problem in Roberts of

2

course which was a plurality opinion was that there was no

3

instruction at all that even authorized the jury to find a

4

lesser included offense if it wanted to give a life

5

sentence instead of a death sentence.

6

QUESTION:

What do you think about that?

The

7

other thing more philosophically, as a prosecutor, someone

on that side, if this court were to say nullification

instructions are okay, might that come back to haunt you

some day in other cases, indeed to bite you if you see

11

what I'm driving at?

12

as a prosecutor.

13

I want to get your reaction to that

MR. SCHAERR:

I think the way the word

14

nullification was used by the Texas Court of Criminal

15

Appeals, it was simply that the jury could in essence

16

nullify what it might otherwise consider to be the correct

17

answer to one of those three special interrogatories.

18

don't think they were saying that nullification

19

instructions as a general matter are proper or anything

20

like that but as used here that's what nullification

21

means.

22

I

I don't think there's any magic.
QUESTION:

The word nullification instruction is

23

almost an oxymoron, isn't it, because you think of

24

nullification jury as refusing to follow an instruction

25

rather than following one.

MR. SCHAERR:

Right and that was the situation

2

in Roberts, but that's not the situation here.

At the end

3

of the day the instruction at issue here was reasonable in

4

my view, if for no other reason that it gave the jury at

5

least one clear path to a life sentence based on the

6

petitioner's mitigating evidence and that is all that this

7

court's decisions clearly required.

8

Now finally I think it's important to remember as the

Court considers the statute here that Edpa was designed to

10

curb what Congress saw as an enormous and undue federal

burden on the state's criminal justice system.
