ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. BURLING:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
According to local land use regulations there

11

are two uses to which Mr. Palazzolo's property can be put,

12

residential and a beach club.

13

applied to fill all 18 acres of his property which would

14

have made the property suitable for either use.

15

was denied, he applied for a lesser scaled-back permit

16

application to fill 11 and a half acres for a beach club.

17
18

QUESTION:

that's a zoning authority of the town.
MR. BURLING:

20

QUESTION:

22

That is correct, Your Honor.

What is that zoning authority, the

zoning board?
MR. BURLING:

That is the Town of Westerly's

zoning authority, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

assumption, and both parties agree on that assumption,

2

that the only development that would be allowed is perhaps

3

a single residence on the high ground.

4

QUESTION:

So far as the '83 denial, it seems to

5

me that was the skimpiest kind of showing, I don't see any

6

zoning authority accepting a proposal to just fill the

7

marsh without any further specified use.

8

count that very heavily in your favor.

9

beach club is concerned, that's a bit different.

I don't really

So far as the
Do you

10

read the opinion by Judge Israel and then the opinion by

11

Judge Williams and the opinion by the Supreme Court of

12

Rhode Island as, particularly the latter, as proceeding on

13

the assumption that the one lot with the residence on the

14

high ground would be the only permitted development? Can

15

we take the case on that assumption.

16

MR. BURLING:

That is correct, Your Honor. We

17

know from the reasons given by the Coastal Resource

18

Management Council, CRMC, for its denial of the 1985

19

application, that it found that a beach club would not

20

serve the compelling public interest standard that the

21

CRMC has for approving applications.

22

QUESTION:

Was it that beach club or any beach

23

club?

Because that beach club was just about 11 acres of

24

paving with a Port-a-John and a dumpster and a couple

25

trash cans.

Is the State going to tell us, oh, well, we

1

might have approved some other use? Are we going to hear

2

that from the State, do you think?

3

MR. BURLING:

I do not believe they will, Your

4

Honor, because they have never made that allegation or

5

statement previously in this case with regard to any kind

6

of beach club use being allowed. Now, this beach club,

7

which by the way was unpaved and did have very minimal

8

structures, Mr. Palazzolo believed that that would have

9

less of an environmental impact than having structures

10

with sanitation facilities and things of that nature.

11

know quite clearly what uses he could and could not do

12

with the property.

13

out that no residential structures of any kind would meet

14

the public purpose requirement of CRMC.

15

QUESTION:

We

At trial, for example, it was brought

I thought that the record showed that

16

the Rhode Island courts concluded that Mr. Palazzolo could

17

have built quote, at least one house on the upland portion

18

of the property, the CRMC director testified he might have

19

built as many as four, and that the residual property

20

would have had a value of about $157,000 if given as open

21

land.

22

MR. BURLING:

Your Honor, if I may try to

23

clarify the record a bit on that, we do readily admit that

24

the State has said that it would gladly allow Mr.

25

Palazzolo to apply for one homesite on the small upland

2

turn around, 50 by 80-foot turn around, excuse me, at the

3

end of the 1500-foot roadway.

4

There was some initial testimony at trial regarding other

5

wetland uses, excuse me, other upland uses perhaps, but

6

later on at trial that became clear that any other upland

7

on this property could only be reached by filling wetland

8

to access it.

9

made it quite clear that there were no residential

That would be allowed.

And at trial the CRMC executive director

10

structures could meet the compelling public purpose.

11

think we're going in this case --

12

QUESTION:

I

They wouldn't let you build the house

13

or not?

I thought -- was there testimony at trial that

14

you could have built up to four houses, the CRMC director

15

said, I don't have the exact words, but I take it he might

16

be able to build as many as four.

17

MR. BURLING:

And later on in testimony by

18

CRMC's biologist show that to reach any other upland on

19

the property wetlands would have to be filled, and that

20

would not be in the public interest.

the compelling public interest there.

QUESTION:

It would not meet

So there's a finding by them that you

couldn't build four?

In other words -- what I'm trying to

24

get at is, you're saying that the value of the property

was reduced to near zero.

Some -- or that what you think is

equivalent to Lucas zero, because it might have been worth

kinds of argument about what the value of the house would

have been, the value of the place would have been, how do

we know?

What --

8
9

We'll have a record here in findings and all

MR. BURLING:

I think, Your Honor, the best way

of telling is looking at the State's opposition to the

10

petition for cert where they say in there that they would

11

gladly allow Mr. Palazzolo to build a single family home

12

--

13

QUESTION:

Twice in the brief in opposition they

14

acknowledge that the CMRC would have approved a single

15

home site, which would have netted greater proceeds i.e.

16

$200,000 at less risk, they say that on page four, and

17

again at say, page 19, they say specifically the Council

18

would be happy to have petitioner situate a single home

19

thus allowing petitioner to realize $200,000.

20

know, I thought that was not in the case when we took it.

21

MR. BURLING:

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

We might not have taken it had I

thought it was in the case.

you more.

QUESTION:

Is it also the case that in order to

2

build more, whatever the more might be, beach house,

3

residential development, whatnot, there would have to be

4

filling of the wetland; is that correct?

5
6
7

MR. BURLING:

That is absolutely correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Now, what is the significance of the

8

finding, and I think it was in Judge Israel's opinion, but

9

I could be wrong about which one it was, that any such

10

filling would have been a nuisance at common law for the

11

simple reason that it would in effect have eliminated the

12

use of the wetland for fin and shellfish breeding and so

13

on, what's the significance of the nuisance finding?

14

MR. BURLING:

15

one that talked about nuisance.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BURLING:

Judge Williams' decision is the

Williams used nuisance?
Yes, your Honor.

And he was

18

referring to the consequences from the 18-acre fill, and

19

specifically if you look at the language of his decision,

20

he talks about the impacts caused by nitrate pollution.

21

Nitrates come from septic systems, however, as I said

22

earlier, Mr. Palazzolo's beach club application would

23

involve no septic systems --

24

QUESTION:

25

Because they were going to have

portable toilets?

MR. BURLING:

That is correct, your Honor.

2

Specifically to avoid any problems with septic systems or

3

nitrates.

4

QUESTION:

No, but I'm -- I don't want to reduce

5

the case to something silly, but I mean is the takings

6

claim predicated on the right that in measuring the

7

taking, we should measure it on the assumption that he was

8

somehow reasonably bound to be allowed to build a beach

9

club with nothing but portable sanitation, is that in

10

effect the kind of baseline for the claim?

11

MR. BURLING:

Not precisely, Your Honor. The

12

baseline of our claim is that Mr. Palazzolo can make no

13

use whatsoever of any of his wetland.

14

--

15

QUESTION:

Now, the issue of

But what is the basis upon which you

16

claim that you have or should have a right to fill the

17

wetland.

18

MR. BURLING:

Traditionally in Rhode Island one

19

owning riparian property has always had the right to fill

20

the wetland.

21

has been the law in Rhode Island for a century and a half.

22

As the Supreme Court said below at pages A3 to A4, that as

23

of the early 1960s there was not even a permit requirement

24

to fill wetland.

25

Indeed, as our reply brief points out, this

QUESTION:

All right, now, let's assume that at

1

some point the State says, well, this is causing damage,

2

it's either going to cause pollution because of nitrates

3

or it's going to interfere with the fisheries because

4

things breed in the shallow waters and so on, is it your

5

position, in effect, that if the State decides to

6

regulate, to prohibit wetland filling, that it therefore

7

is engaging in a taking of every piece of wetland that a

8

landowner might otherwise wish to fill?

9
10

MR. BURLING:

This would have to be looked at on

a case-by-case basis.

11

QUESTION:

No, but is that the assumption of

12

your claim here that you used to have a right to fill any

13

wetland, and regardless of what the reason for the State

14

saying you no longer can do that, that is a taking.

15

MR. BURLING:

Not precisely, Your Honor, because

16

if the State is able to prove that the particular

17

application before it would cause a nuisance and by

18

nuisance talking about a genuine nuisance not something

19

decreed anew, not something that has always been unlawful.

20

QUESTION:

But, with respect, in other words,

21

you're saying if it could prove the nuisance then there

22

would have been no change from the prior law.

23

25

MR. BURLING:

That is correct, Your Honor, if

you -QUESTION:

All right, now let's assume that it

1

would never have been understood to be a nuisance at the

2

prior law because nobody ever paid any attention to that

3

and they now say, well, we don't want nitrates to go up,

4

we want fish to breed and so on, and that's the reason, is

5

that the predicate for the taking claim?

6

MR. BURLING:

When talking about what is and

7

what is not a nuisance, it is important not to simply say

8

that the law of nuisance is coterminus with the police

9

power, in this case it's not only that it was not a

10

nuisance beforehand, but also that the State has not

11

proven that the proposals by Mr. Palazzolo would indeed

12

constitute a nuisance.

13

that we have new knowledge today and it is therefore a

14

nuisance, the inquiry must be more searching than that.

15

QUESTION:

It is not enough simply to say

Let me ask you a different question,

16

would it be a predicate for the taking claim for a State

17

to pass a statute saying all dwellings, all public

18

accommodations must have modern plumbing with septic

19

systems, would that -- and in the past that wasn't

20

necessary, so it naturally reduces the value of the land

21

because it makes it more difficult, more expensive to

22

develop.

23

Would that be a predicate for a taking claim?
MR. BURLING:

Probably not, but again, we must

24

look at the individual circumstances of the case.

25

the septic systems being required?

Why are

If it is to prevent a

1

genuine health and safety risk then I would have to concur

2

that that would be a regulation passed to protect public

3

health and safety and it may rise to the level of a

4

nuisance.

5

QUESTION:

What I'm getting -- no, I'm sorry.

6

All I'm getting at is, it sounds suspiciously to me as

7

though that, at least, is what was involved or could have

8

been involved whether it was stated or not when the State

9

said, no, we're not going to let you build a beach club

10

without any plumbing.

11

pollution by any plumbing system that went in because of

12

runoff from the septic system or a beach club with no

13

plumbing at all, and in effect modern outhouses, that

14

seems to me a weak basis for a takings claim and if that's

15

not we're concerned with I want you to explain it to me.

16

MR. BURLING:

And if the alternative was

The State Supreme Court did not in

17

this case base its decision on the existence of a

18

nuisance.

19

the State Supreme Court and that could be found at pages

20

12 to 14 of Mr. Palazzolo's brief to the State Supreme

21

Court, but the issue was never reached --

Indeed the finding of nuisance was appealed to

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Can I ask about the beach club, I

thought after the beach club application you came up with

another application that was just -- just to fill.

MR. BURLING:

The beach

application was the last application.

7

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Was the second one.

The first was

just to fill without any specification.

8

MR. BURLING:

9

QUESTION:

Correct.

Correct.

And that was turned down.

10

MR. BURLING:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BURLING:

Correct.

For what reason?
It was turned down because it

13

lacked specificity and because of some general concerns

14

that it would impact the environment.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BURLING:

17

Specificity in what respect?
The plans needed to have more

detail in them, contour lines and things of that nature.

But the --

QUESTION:
do the fill, did he?

Well, he didn't say why he wanted to
He said I want to fill this.

MR. BURLING:

In the application -- in the

21

application, he did not indicate why he wanted to do the

22

fill.

23

He wanted to move this on in a multistep process.
QUESTION:

Why does he have to show why he

24

wanted to do the fill?

I mean the only change was the

going to use it for a beach club?

3

MR. BURLING:

4

Does he have to say he's

He does not, and we do not think

so, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Do you know of any zoning authority

6

in the United States that would allow a major filling

7

without knowing what structure was going to be put on it?

8

I mean, I just don't think we -- I don't think we need to

9

get in that because I think the Supreme Court of Rhode

10

Island did reach the issues that you wish to present to

11

us.

12

MR. BURLING:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think I have some question, they

14

did say that the owner hasn't sought permission for any

15

use that would involve substantially less filling, but

16

having left us with that lingering doubt they then rush

17

into the merits.

18

MR. BURLING:

That is correct, Your Honor. I

19

don't think this case needs to turn on the 18-acre

20

application, indeed it was not even part of the complaint.

21

I think the key here is understanding that no filling of

22

any wetland would be allowed for any reason that was

23

lawful under the local zoning code.

24

kind would be permitted by Mr. Palazzolo to construct.

we know that he cannot use his wetland.

QUESTION:

What portion of his, 18 acres is it?

What portion is wetland and what portion upland?

4

MR. BURLING:

The 18 acres is all wetland. The

5

upland portion is the small road that I referred to

6

earlier with the turn around.

7

island of upland, the amount unspecified how much, but it

8

is fairly small, that is surrounded by wetland.

9

QUESTION:

10

There may be an isolated

Small compared to the 18 acres.

MR. BURLING:

And indeed small compared to the

11

total size of that road and the turn around on that as

12

well.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Can we assume 20 acres of which 18 is

wetlands?
MR. BURLING:

The court never concluded that it

16

was 20 acres, and it is probably less than that.

17

can not be more specific than that. Since we know what

18

uses can and cannot be made with the property, the primary

19

question that is of concern to us is whether or not the

20

existence of regulations in 1978 when Mr. Palazzolo

21

acquired the property is sufficient to deny him the

22

ability to challenge the, either the application of those

23

regulations or challenge the impact of those regulations

24

upon him if he contends that that is a regulatory taking.

25

We certainly know that Shore Gardens, Incorporated had,

But I

1

from 1971 until the time it was dissolved in 1978, the

2

right to apply for permits and the right to bring a

3

takings claim if those permits were denied.

4

To suggest that the State can deny a permit and

5

refuse somebody even the right to seek just compensation

6

because they acquired the property from a predecessor is

7

contrary

8

which I don't need to repeat the entire cite, except this

9

Court did say briefly, so long as the commission could not

to what this Court had held earlier in Nollan

10

have deprived prior owners of the easement without

11

compensating them, the prior owners must be understood to

12

have transferred their full property rights in conveying

13

the lot.

14
15

QUESTION:

May I ask one very brief question?

In your opinion, when did the taking occur in this case?

16

MR. BURLING:

The taking occurred in 1986 when

17

the permit was denied.

18

existence until that time because as we also pointed out

19

in our brief, this Court has held in Preseault that the

20

existence of a permitting requirement in and of itself

21

does not generally take property.

22

Government in good faith will allow a permit to be granted

23

or will at least consider that permit fairly.

The taking was simply not in

One expects that the

QUESTION:

Mr. Burling, if rights to land use

pass from owner to owner like that, how far back does the

5

chain go?

the 17th century settlement. So where do we draw the line?

There are two answers to that,

Your Honor, a theoretical one and a practical one to this

10

case.

11

principles, I would suggest that we go back as far in time

12

as before there was an existence of pervasive regulation.

13

But that rather theoretical issue is one that this Court

14

does not need to fully address because as we pointed out

15

in our brief and as I said previously, as of the early

16

1960s there was absolutely no requirement for a litigant

17

to obtain a permit to fill wetland.

18

century and a half before that that there was a right, not

19

only to fill wetland but to fill tidelands which are those

lands that are under water all the time.

MR. BURLING:

QUESTION:

No, no, not still do exist. Did they

exist in 1985?
MR. BURLING:

Yes, Your Honor.

They existed in

1985 because the imposition of a permitting requirement

that was adopted in 1971, as I said earlier, does not

effect the background principles of property law.

It requires a

But it --

QUESTION:

May I ask the extent to which it

14

affects the reasonable investment expectations of someone

15

who buys property with regulations already in existence,

16

so that when you buy the property you know to develop this

17

it's going to be a tough uphill battle, because I know

18

what's on the books and I know how they've treated them.

19

MR. BURLING:

You certainly, when you buy

20

property and it's subject to regulation, you have the

21

expectations that it's going to be more of a difficulty to

22

develop that property, but I do not believe that that

23

affects the background principles of the very property

24

itself, the regulation that you are challenging in a

25

takings case cannot still affect background principles

Why doesn't the same argument apply

onerous that it takes property.

QUESTION:

Now that is normally not

But that's a different question.

The

10

ultimate question of the taking, it seems to me is

11

separate from the question of what background principles

12

are supposed to apply to define how you calculate the

13

taking, and I suppose that if the background principle of

14

filling wetland cannot be tampered with in effect by new

15

wetland regulation then the background principle of being

16

able to build the property line cannot be tampered with by

a setback requirement.

of regulation.

Why isn't a reasonable

MR. BURLING:

When we're talking about the

I have seen is one adopted by a lower Pennsylvania Court

in a case we cited in our reply brief called Machipongo,

based on an article by fee in the Chicago law review.

19

That sets a standard that you look at the amount of area

put in that particular set-back, and if that area is so

large, then that area by itself would be an economically

viable use of property if you could put it to some use

there has been a denial of economically viable use, then

11

in a Penn Central analysis which I think is the next place

that the Court should look at, certainly the character of

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS

12
13
14

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As this Court stated in Armstrong versus United

15

States, the just compensation clause was designed to bar a

16

government from forcing some people alone to bear public

17

burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be

18

borne by the public as a whole.

19

regulatory takings claim necessarily depends upon the

20

proposition that he has been unfairly singled out to bear

21

a disproportionate share of the burdens attendant on the

22

provision of public benefits or the prevention of public

23

harms. In our view the record entirely fails to bear out

24

that assertion.

1

clause and Armstrong isn't the only case construing the

2

just compensation clause.

3

MR. STEWART:

No, that's correct.

And certainly

4

this Court in Lucas made clear that even when there is no

5

exercise of eminent domain authority or physical

6

occupation of the land there may be a taking if the burden

7

imposed by regulatory limitations on land use has the same

8

practical effect as a direct appropriation.

9

QUESTION:

The case is somewhat like Lucas, it

10

seems to me, in that other landowners who got there first

11

were left alone and then the wetlands people got into the

12

act.

Or am I wrong in that construction?

13

MR. STEWART:

I think that's incorrect. At

14

least, in our view, the record in this case strongly

15

supports the assertion that filling of wetlands has been a

16

very rare practice in this part of Rhode Island.

17

true that it wasn't until comparatively recently that

18

statutory permit requirements were imposed as a

19

prerequisite to the fill of wetlands.

occurred.

Now, my understanding is that even as to the dry

wetlands and it doesn't have the same environmental

2

consequences as wetlands fill. And the point we'd like to

3

stress is that the requirements imposed most recently by

applicable limitations on the ways in which wetlands

properties can be used and they secure a reciprocity of

advantage to landowners in the vicinity.

the use he can make of the wetlands portion of his

property, but at the same time the fact that those

12

prohibitions are imposed on his neighbors as well tends to

13

benefit Mr. Palazzolo insofar as his tract also includes

14

an uplands area, because presumably the prevention of

15

filling by neighbors preserves the quality of the

environmental resources in the area, most notably

function as a sort of density restriction that is --

MR. STEWART:

I think the short answer is that

as the case comes to this Court I think the petitioner has

3

really given up any claim that the wetlands portion of the

4

property constitutes a separate parcel because the third

5

question presented was --

MR. STEWART:

I agree that the argument has --

QUESTION:

Whether the remaining permissible

uses of regulated property are economically viable.
MR. STEWART:

Right, merely because the property

13

retains a value greater than zero.

14

the body of the petition of that third question presented

15

made it clear that Mr. Palazzolo was not claiming the

16

wetlands portion are a -- constitute a separate parcel and

17

the value of that is zero.

18

takings claim as it came to the Court in the cert petition

19

was that the parcel as a whole had a value of only

20

$200,000 and that that value was so small in comparison to

21

the purported 3 million dollar figure as to amount to a

22

total deprivation of economically beneficial use.

23

And the explication in

1

together, and the State's appraiser testified, and his

2

testimony was credited by the trier of fact, that the

3

presence of wetland areas even if they couldn't be

4

separately developed would enhance the value of a home

5

constructed on the uplands area, in the sense that a house

6

constructed on a 20-acre parcel is going to be more

7

valuable than a house constructed on a two-acre plot,

8

because you have open space, you have a feeling of privacy

9

and seclusion.

I think it's also important to recognize

10

that the original investment in this property was

11

something less than $13,000, that is -- I say something

12

less because SGI purchased a larger parcel for $13,000 and

13

partly in 1959 and partly in 1969 sold portions of it for

14

prices that aren't revealed in the record.

15

So if Mr. Palazzolo or his predecessor, SGI, put

16

in $13,000 and now has something worth $200,000 he's

17

hardly had anything taken from him.

QUESTION:

Well, I really think that's

irrelevant and that's -- Justice Breyer suggested there

should be a cap, that assumes the Government doesn't have

to be reasonable on an ongoing basis, I think that's just

wrong.

comes on and says, well, look, you only paid 15,000 for

MR. STEWART:

I agree, if Mr. Palazzolo could

ever identify a point in time at which the property was

worth 3 million dollars, then we would have a very

different case.

We're not taking it on the assumption

hypothetical the land would have actually been valued at 1

million dollars in the real world today. But if you look

3

at the methodology that was addressed by Mr. Palazzolo's

appraiser, he took as his starting point the price that

was paid for a comparable lot in 1988.

6

price was paid in an environment where wetlands

development in this region is subject to substantial

restrictions.

Now obviously that

So in effect what the appraiser was determining

10

was, if Mr. Palazzolo could develop his property to the

hilt and everybody else around him remained subject to

12

extensive restrictions on development, his property would

dramatically appreciate in value.

the appraiser was correct in that hypothesis, it can't

MR. BURLING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A

2

few points to rebut was just said, I think that when we

3

look at what property has been taken and what property has

4

not been taken, we're talking about, are we only going to

5

look at the wetlands or are we only going to look at the

6

upland? Our case is submitted on the idea that there are

7

many ways of determining whether or not there has been a

8

denial of economically viable use and whether or not there

9

has been a taking.

It may be that in some cases we're

10

dealing simply with a large parcel and we're looking at

11

that time devaluation of that parcel.

12

be that we're dealing, as here, with a situation where

13

some of the land is carved out and you're told you can use

14

some of it but the vast majority of that you cannot.

15

Some cases it may

The problem of what happened in the court below

MR. BURLING:

There are three independent

that the case is not ripe and I think we've talked about

that, the other that he bought the property on notice of

the existence of the regulation, and third the court did

9

look at the fact that there was some value left in finding

that the existence of some value took the case outside of

assume there's a value greater than zero because the

case that the wetlands also have value that enhances the

MR. BURLING:

Either way, Your Honor, the

I am

If that remaining wetland

belonged to the State, if it had been taken by the State,

15

that nice view has been taken by the State.

true value of what the upland is, if you do not add in

$200,000 value comes from, it talks about a few dollars

just purchase the 18 or so acres of wetlands and sue.

3

MR. BURLING:

A later purchaser of those 18

4

acres, after attempting to go through the permitting

5

process, may indeed be able to sue if, as the question

6

said earlier, this area is within the economically viable

7

size of development in the area. I think that is one way

8

of looking at it, we certainly know that there are three

home sites on fill in the -- immediately adjacent to Mr.

10

Palazzolo's property.

Home sites that are very small as

11

the record reflects.

12

developable property on site, then indeed that should be

looked at separately.

14

think this Court needs to fully determine, what -- what

15

the situation would be in that hypothetical, because in

16

this case we know that Mr. Palazzolo can make no use of

17

his wetland, and we know that his -- the value of the
