CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

versus the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

Mr. Hallett.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRELL D. HALLETT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. HALLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

10

the Court:

As a result of the position taken by the

11

Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the brief before this

12

Court, the issue the Court needs to decide is a limited

13

one.

14

discharge or cancellation of debt of an insolvent debtor

15

which is excluded from income under Section 108 is income,

16

such that it amounts to an item of income which increases

17

the

18

1367 of the Internal Revenue Code.

And that issue is whether the amount of debt

shareholder's stock basis under Sections 1366 and

19

The Commissioner rests his entire case in his

20

brief on the argument that under Section 108 no income is

21

realized by the insolvent debtor.

22

position is clearly contrary to the statute.

23

rather than paraphrasing initially, read the statute, I

24

think it's really critical to this issue and resolves this

25

issue.

Your Honors, that
And if I may

And that statute is section 108(a)(1) in the
3

1

appendix to the petition, at Page 34.

2

And it states as follows:

Gross income does not

3

include any amount which, but for this subsection, would

4

be

5

of indebtedness of the taxpayer if the discharge occurs

6

when the taxpayer is insolvent.

7

includable in gross income by reason of the discharge

To paraphrase that, Your Honors, what that

8

subsection (a) says in hopefully plain English is that an

9

item is only excluded under Section 108 if it otherwise

10
11

would have been included in gross income under Section 61.
QUESTION:

Well, I think your argument under the

12

statute is a strong one.

13

theory or practical equity why Congress would want to

14

allow this result in this particular case?

15

understand that the statute may compel this, but is there

16

some underlying rationale to support your position?

17

MR. HALLETT:

But is there any reason in tax

I mean, I

It may well be consistent with the

18

restructuring of the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, in

19

which Congress said very broadly in Section 61 that gross

20

income includes all income from whatever source derived,

21

and listed specific items, some 15 of

22

them is income from subsection 12.

those, and one of

23

And then consistent with that over in Sections

24

101 through 138, those items that are included in income

25

are specifically excluded from gross income.
4

So --

1

QUESTION: What I am asking is why would Congress

2

allow you to use income that you don't pay tax on, to

3

increase the basis and then which would allow you to

4

deduct additional unrelated losses?

5

MR. HALLETT:

Well, first of all, because this

6

statute clearly says that --

7

QUESTION:

8

I know that's position number one.

I'm asking, is there a reason for this?

9

MR. HALLETT:

There's a reason for it is that in

10

the final analysis, the basis reflects the

11

equity in the corporation, roughly

12

shareholder gets equity in the corporation by contributing

13

capital.

14

income is realized, taxable or nontaxable.

15

Congress recognized that if losses have accumulated such

16

that they are not deductible because they exceed the

17

basis, well when income is realized, nontaxable income

18

such as municipal bond interest, that income goes down to

19

increase the basis to reflect the fact that there now is

20

an increased equity investment.

21

shareholder's

speaking, and the

He also gets equity in the corporation when
And the

QUESTION: Mr. Hallett, it seems that the

22

Subchapter S shareholder is the only solvent entity who

23

could take advantage of this.

24

this provision is that every other taxpayer, say a

25

Subchapter C corporation, a partner in a partnership, the

The peculiar thing about

5

1

insolvent would have to be that entity, that tax paying

2

entity.

3

Subchapter S corporation, which is not itself a taxpayer,

4

is the insolvent, while the shareholders are highly

5

solvent.

6

to give those solvent taxpayers this advantageous

7

treatment?

8
9

But here you have the peculiarity that the

And is there any reason why Congress would want

MR. HALLETT:

I think what -- they clearly did

that in 1984 when the Congress said that in the case of an

10

S corporation, the amount is excluded if there's

11

insolvency at the corporation level.

12

recognized that by doing that, the benefit of the

13

exclusion would come down to the shareholder who could

14

well be solvent.

15

They certainly

And I think to the extent the legislative

16

history reflects why they did that, it made it simpler to

17

look to the insolvency of the corporation rather than up

18

to 75 shareholders.

19

any situation, certainly not all, if the S corporation is

20

in trouble, the shareholder is in trouble as well.

21

QUESTION:

They may well have recognized that in

But it wasn't that way up until --

22

and yet, in 1982 -- well, let me put it this way:

Do you

23

recognize that if the 1982 law was still in place, the

24

government should win?

25

MR. HALLETT:

Well, it would depend on whether
6

1

or not my clients the shareholders were insolvent.

2

they were insolvent then they would be entitled to the

3

result that we are seeking.

4

QUESTION:

If

Yes, but in this case where we have

5

very solvent shareholders and an insolvent Subchapter S

6

corporation.

7

MR. HALLETT:

This particular case, if the law

8

would have remained as it was in 1982, then if the

9

shareholder were solvent he would not be able to exclude

10

the amount from gross income.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HALLETT:

13

QUESTION:

So it was the change in '84?
It was a change in 1984.

And so we would look to a reason for

14

that change if we are trying to understand, as Justice

15

Kennedy asked, whether there might be something other than

16

the words of the statute going for the position you are

17

taking?

18

MR. HALLETT:

That is true.

We would look to

19

the change.

20

critical statutes that existed prior to the change in 1984

21

and the statutes which provide for the basis increase, and

22

those are Sections 1366 and 1367.

23
24
25

But I think you would also look to the

Now when Congress made the change in 1984, they
did not change those provisions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hallett, is it invariably the
7

1

case that this comes as a windfall to the solvent

2

shareholder?

3

benefit that the shareholder gets?

4

MR. HALLETT:

5

a windfall.

6

windfall.

7

Would the government never recapture the

Well, it's not the case that it's

It's certainly not the case that it's a

QUESTION:

Accept my characterization

of it as

8

a windfall.

9

benefit to the shareholder to be recaptured by the

10
11

Would any events in the future enable that

government?
MR. HALLETT:

Well, certainly if you view a

12

benefit excluding the debt discharge amount from gross

13

income, then if the attribute deduction provisions come

14

into play, you could view that as a recapture of the

15

benefit in the future.

16

QUESTION:

Well, suppose the corporation

17

suddenly becomes solvent, its business picks up or in some

18

new sort of business. I assume that at that point the

19

distortion would even out for years, say one, two, three,

20

four and five, because the net operating losses which

21

might otherwise have been deducted against the new income

22

are now diminished by reason of the discharge of

23

indebtedness income.

24

MR. HALLETT:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So there, to answer Justice Scalia's
8

1

question, there might be, I think there might be some

2

instances in which this distortion, if we can call it

3

that, or windfall, does even itself out?

4

MR. HALLETT:

That's correct.

And much as Your

5

Honor stated, the increase in basis by the amount of

6

discharged debt occurs at the time of the insolvency and

7

permits the taking of the losses.

8

losses, the losses of course go away.

9
10

QUESTION:

And by taking of the

So it isn't always a windfall or

distortion, accepting those characterizations?

11

MR. HALLETT:

It's not always a windfall.

12

QUESTION:

13

Kennedy's question.

14

character will be in subsequent tax years; is that

15

correct?

And I guess this was in Justice
The events that deny the windfall

16

MR. HALLETT:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Going back to your very initial point

18

about Section 108, if Section 108 had read,

19

income shall not include , instead of

20

not include , then the government would be right; is that

21

correct?

22

MR. HALLETT:

items of

gross income does

Well, I don't think so because it

23

-- it would still presuppose that the item is income.

24

other words --

25

QUESTION:

No. I'm saying if it specifically
9

In

1

said income from discharge of a debt shall not be treated

2

as an item of income.

3

MR. HALLETT:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HALLETT:

6
7

Yes.

Then your whole case would collapse.
Yes.

If Congress would have said

specifically that COD is not income.
QUESTION:

So it s the difference between

8

excluding from gross income and specifically stating that

9

it's not an item of income, as the case turns out.

10

MR. HALLETT:

Exactly.

And that's a very

11

important distinction that was drawn when Section 108 was

12

enacted in 1980.

13

I'd also point out, Your Honor, that if the

14

Commissioner were correct, that COD is not income, then

15

Section 108 would never apply to an insolvent debtor.

16

if we look at Section 108(b), it only comes into play if

17

an amount is excluded under Section 108(a).

18

not income and it's therefore, doesn't come within 108(a)

19

because it otherwise wouldn't be income, then the

20

attribute reduction process which the Commissioner places

21

so much weight upon would never occur.

22

QUESTION:

And

Now if it's

So what's supposed to happen?

Some

23

disaster must occur in the tax code since the government

24

did at one point push this argument, but it stopped, I

25

want to know what disaster occurs if you just take
10

1

108(d)(7)(a), in which it says these things will apply at

2

the corporate level.

3

level, those three sub -- four subsections, (a), (b), (c)

4

and (g); (c) and (g) are just special cases, but (a) and

5

(b) is the main case.

6

level.

7

through.

8

attributes don't flow through.

9

All right.

It says it applies at the corporate

It says they apply at the corporate

What does that mean?

It means it doesn't flow

It's very simple; nothing flows through.

The

Nothing flows through.

Now once you say that, that cures

10

what seems an anomaly from a point of view of policy.

11

don't we interpret it that way?

12

MR. HALLETT:

13
14

Why

Because the statute doesn't say

that.
QUESTION:

Well, let's see what it says.

It

15

says, in the case of an S corporation, subsections (a),

16

(b), (c) and (g) shall be applied at the corporate level.

17

Now why can I not take those words to mean they shall be

18

applied at the corporate level and only the corporate

19

level, i.e., they do not flow through?

20

MR. HALLETT:

21

applied at the corporate level.

22

(a), the exclusion from gross income is applied at the

23

corporate level.

24

corporation realizes the income and it excludes it.

25

Because we have to look at what is
For example, subsection

And that's logically because the

QUESTION:

Right.
11

1

MR. HALLETT:

Subsection (b), and this is the

2

critical part of the statute, an essential part of the

3

statute as amended in 1984, is that the insolvency is

4

determined at the corporate level.

5

provisions do not say anything about the basis pass

6

through.

7

QUESTION:

But those two

I know they say nothing.

They say

8

nothing.

So what I'm doing is suggesting that because

9

they say nothing one way or the other, one can interpret

10

those words

11

mean everything to do with 108 applies at the corporate

12

level in the case of the Subchapter S corporation, and

13

does not flow through.

14

I not do that?

15

shall be applied at the corporate level

MR. HALLETT:

So what I'm asking you is why can

Because the statute doesn't say

16

everything occurs at the corporate level.

17

gross income is excluded --

18
19

QUESTION:

I've got that point.

MR. HALLETT:

21

QUESTION:

22

25

Your point is

Yes.

Is there anything other than the

language?

23
24

It says the

the language.

20

MR. HALLETT:

The plain language of the

statute.
QUESTION:

to

Nothing else.

MR. HALLETT:

And the failure to say anything in

2

either 108 or Sections 1366 and 67 about the general rule

3

of basis -- pass through to basis not occurring.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HALLETT:

6

So you're -There's nothing to suggest that.

Not a hint.

7

QUESTION:

Is it an answer to Justice Breyer,

8

and I may be wrong about this, that if that interpretation

9

prevailed, there would be some instances in which the

10

shareholder was really entitled to a double tax.

11

words, if there were basis left and the basis were not

12

decreased as a result of this interpretation, then the

13

shareholder in effect would be paying a double tax in some

14

instances, or am I wrong about that?

15

MR. HALLETT:

Well, I'm not sure it would result

16

in a double tax.

17

Code language that's simply not there.

18

In other

I think it clearly would read into the

QUESTION:

Well, that the shareholder would be

19

taxed in effect for discharge of indebtedness income even

20

though the corporation was insolvent.

21

MR. HALLETT:

22

QUESTION:

23

That's true.

Because the basis would not be

reduced.

24

MR. HALLETT:

25

QUESTION:

That's true.

That's true.

Mr. Hallett, may I go back to an
13

1

earlier colloquy, and that is, as I understand it in this

2

case, the tax attributes, at least under your theory, they

3

wouldn't -- that would be an academic question because the

4

losses here were entirely wiped out against the increased

5

basis.

6

Isn't that right?
MR. HALLETT:

There were no losses left.

True.

Once we go through the

7

process of determining how much the losses exceeded basis

8

for the taxable year, as the statute tells us to do, if

9

the losses are completely absorbed by the COD, if they are

10

completely absorbed because of the increase in basis, then

11

assuming there's no other attribute, assuming there's no

12

basis in assets that can be reduced, that would be true.

13

QUESTION:

I take that to be the case here, that

14

the losses were totally absorbed.

15

MR. HALLETT:

No.

Actually, and I have to point

16

out, this is not in the record, Your Honor, the losses

17

were totally absorbed but there was some $800 thousand

18

basis in assets and properly applied, even though the

19

losses were absorbed, the COD income is still there and

20

the COD income would be applied in the next taxable year

21

to reduce the basis in the assets.

22
23

QUESTION:

next tax return before us, so we don't --

24
25

But that's not -- we don't have the

MR. HALLETT:
correct.

No, no, that's true.

That's

And I would just point out, it's a very
14

1

important concept of Section 108 that, I think it's -- you

2

read the legislative

3

about a purpose is to pick up the income in the future

4

through the attribute reduction, but Congress allowed a

5

very very important exception to that.

6

full ability to use net operating loss carryovers or basis

7

in the case of property sold in the year of discharge.

8

Very very important, such that certainly many taxpayers

9

are going to have excluded COD income but they are not

I don't believe the situation we have here is in

any way an anomaly.

18

And that's the

We have absolute proof of that in one

The Pugh case, there were no attributes at

There were no suspended losses, there was no basis

And the Court of Appeals of course

So we know that situation.

We know that

situation exists.

19

QUESTION:

Why do you say it's no anomaly?

I

20

would think with an ordinary corporation the chance of an

21

insolvent corporation ending up with a lot of positive

22

income in the year of insolvency is pretty low.

23

individual, the chance of an individual ending up with a

24

lot of positive income in the year of insolvency is pretty

25

low.
15

With an

1

In the case of an S corporation, the chance that

2

a shareholder of the insolvent S corporation could have a

3

lot of positive income in that year is pretty high.

4

therefore, if we accept your intention for an S

5

corporation, your interpretation, we reach as a practical

6

matter quite a different result in terms of tax windfalls

7

than you do in the other two instances.

8
9

MR. HALLETT:

And

Well, I think though in the other

two instances, take a corporation that's in trouble and

10

has net operating losses, it could well be the situation

11

that it doesn't have any basis in its assets in excess of

12

the liabilities.

13

it doesn't have any attributes to reduce.

14

saying; it's not an anomaly to have a situation such as we

15

have in this case that whether it's a corporation, a

16

regular corporation or a partnership, that we don't end up

17

with any attributes to reduce, particularly because they

can be used in the taxable year

16

That would be reduced.

It would

I would just call the Court's attention as well

17

to one other section that I think solidifies that income

18

is realized as a result of debt discharge and that's

19

Section 108(e)(1) on page 43.

20

there is no other insolvency exception to the general rule

21

that COD is income to be included in gross income.

22

that general rule is provided in Section 61(a)(12).

23

And it specifically says

And

And finally on this matter, the Commissioner

24

goes back to 1923 and cites court cases particularly in

25

the depression era, and a Treasury regulation that was
17

1

promulgated before the substantial 1980 revisions of

2

Section 108.

3

are flawed reasoning.

And I would point out that those court cases
The notion is that --

4

QUESTION:

They are what, Mr. Hallett?

5

MR. HALLETT:

They represent flawed reasoning.

6

The rationale in those cases that if a debtor realizes

7

debt discharge, that there is no income if he's insolvent.

8

Of course the Court held in 1931 in Kirby Lumber that as a

9

general

proposition there is income.

And these cases in

10

the depression era picked up on some language in Kirby

11

Lumber about

12

assets .

doesn't add to

14

income.

15

the forgiveness of the debt frees up

And they said well, if you're insolvent, it
assets.

And so there is no realization of

That was the rationale of those cases.

And I

16

submit that just defies economic reality where a debtor

17

has $2 million in debt, or $1 million in debt, or $100,000

18

in debt, and that is discharged.

19

hundred dollars or a few hundred thousand dollars still

benefit.

22

applied, that would mean where a debtor is insolvent and

Let me turn briefly to the specific language of

there's a question

of where do you start here.

This isn't a narrowly drawn

It says in 1366 that all items of income,

Congress described the reason for the basis

10

that if an item is nontaxable, then if there's later a

15

well, that means that you only could increase basis for a

you can distribute in kind.

18

The Commissioner seizes upon this stated

Well, the statutes don't require that there be a

2

glad the Commissioner brought up this notion of

realization of income, because commentators and some of

the courts have said that, well, you shouldn't give the

shareholder the losses because he hasn't had an economic

It's the economic gain, the income, that Congress has

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

Thank you, Mr. Hallett.

MR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court.

7

Congress did not provide to Subchapter S

8

shareholders the unique double tax benefit that

9

petitioners seek.

10

The simple question presented here is whether

11

the discharge of debt of an insolvent is an item of income

12

or tax exempt income that flows through to shareholders

13

and increases their basis under 1366.

14

The plain text of the directly applicable

15

statutes seems to provide a pretty clear answer to that.

16

QUESTION: Mr. Jones, would you clarify whether

17

you are indeed walking away from the rationale of the

18

Tenth Circuit which was not about the characterization of

19

this as income, but was a timing question, as I understand

20

it.

21

MR. JONES: The timing question, we don't think

22

the timing question ever arises in this case, nor has it

23

ever properly arisen in any of the other cases.

24
25

QUESTION: But you did argue the theory that the
Tenth Circuit accepted; you argued it in the Court of
22

1

Appeals.

2

MR. JONES: Actually, I believe the Tenth Circuit

3

developed that theory on its own.

4

Tenth Circuit as in the other cases our argument has been

5

twofold: that this item has never been regarded in the 80-

6

year history of the Internal Revenue Code as income for an

7

insolvent taxpayer. Secondly, that 108(d)(7) recognizes

8

and is an emanation of that fact.

9

I believe that in the

The Tax Court rationale was that 108(d)(7) says

10

all of this happens at the corporate level.

11

income because it's excluded and it's not tax exempt

12

income so nothing passes through.

13

And it isn't

QUESTION: To put Justice Ginsburg's question

14

another way, if you do not prevail on your argument that

15

it's not income, I take it you don't ask us to accept a

16

backup position that reflects the view of the Circuit on

17

timing.

18

MR. JONES: If the Court were to disagree with

19

our basic contentions, then you would be faced with a

20

problem -- then as a Court the problem would be that you

21

have the clear history of the statute that says this is

22

not to be treated as income.

23

tax attributes and then to be disregarded.

24

have that clear history.

25

presumptive rule that tax statutes should not be

It's to be applied against
So you would

You would also have the

23

1
2

interpreted to provide a double benefit.
QUESTION: No, we don't think it's a problem.

3

Let's assume that we simply reject that argument.

4

to know if the backup argument, if you think that as a

5

matter of sound, statutory construction, I think this is

6

what Justice Ginsburg was asking, for us to accept the

7

timing rule adopted by the Circuit.

8
9

I want

MR. JONES: It is an appropriate resolution of
the problem if you reach it, and the reason that is so, is

10

that 1336(d)(2)requires the losses, the suspended losses

11

from the prior year, to be brought into the corporation in

12

the year of the discharge.

And then --

13

QUESTION: 1336 or 66?

14

MR. JONES: 1366(d)(2).

15

QUESTION: Now Mr. Jones, we've got some 20 pages

16

in the appendix of statutory sections.

17

statutory section, could you refer us to the page of the

18

appendix on which it is?

19

When you cite a

MR. JONES: On Page 53 of the petition appendix.

20

It says, any loss or deduction which is disallowed for a

21

taxable year by reason of the prior paragraph of that same

22

page, shall be treated as incurred by the corporation in

23

the succeeding taxable year.

24
25

Now this is the point that the Tenth Circuit
made, that this provision brings back into the year of the
24

1

discharge the losses from the prior year, the suspended

2

losses from the prior year.

3

And then --

QUESTION: But Mr. Jones, isn't that antithetical

4

to the -- is it in 1017 the general timing rule that you

5

take this in the next year, not in the year of the --

6

MR. JONES: It is a different treatment of

7

suspended losses.

It is expressly a different treatment

8

of suspended losses and how they are handled on the

9

Subchapter S return.

10

Subchapter S's.

11

It is a different treatment for suspended losses.

12

brings them into the year of the discharge.

13

under 108 we know that the tax attribute reduction is to

14

apply at the corporate level.

15

Yes.

These are rules peculiar to
The answer to your question is yes.
It

And then

QUESTION: If you think that the timing rule is

16

changed here, it's surprising that you didn't make any

17

suggestion of that in your brief.

18

MR. JONES: Well, I think that it's -- I wouldn't

19

call it a fall-back argument but I would call it not a

20

correct way to analyze the basic problem that we have in

21

this case, which is that the courts have glossed over the

22

question of whether this has ever been regarded as an item

23

of income, and in particular whether Congress intended it

24

to be treated as such, when the history of the statute

25

says as clearly as it could that Congress accepted the 80
25

1

year old position of the Treasury and the judicial

2

insolvency exception, did not regard this as an item of

3

income, said that it was to be applied to reduce tax

4

attributes and then in the words of both the House and

5

Senate reports, has no further tax consequences.

6

QUESTION: Let me see if I can get you to focus

7

precisely on the point I'm trying to understand.

You have

8

just told us that in the Tenth Circuit brief we will not

9

have found this unusual approach to the timing question.

10

We would not have found that in the government's argument.

11

We certainly don't find it in our brief in this Court.

12

I'm just trying to determine whether the government at

13

least considered it an alternate argument in the lower

14

courts and for some reason abandoned it here.

15

MR. JONES: I think it -- I wouldn't quite put it

16

that way.

17

I have put it, which is that with proper -- we are

18

presenting this case to you with complete integrity.

19

think this issue need not be reached in this case.

20
21
22

I think that the right way to put it is the way

QUESTION: Did you present it the same way in the
Tenth Circuit?
MR. JONES: Actually, I believe in the Tenth

23

Circuit we didn't address the issue.

24

Circuit developed its analysis on its own.

25

We

I believe the Tenth

QUESTION: So if I look at the government's
26

1

brief, I'll find that corroborated?

2

MR. JONES: I think that's correct.

3

QUESTION: Did you address the issue you are now

4

addressing in the Tenth Circuit?

5

Mr. JONES: I'm sorry, Justice?

6

QUESTION: Did you address the issue you're

7

presenting to us in the Tenth Circuit other than --

8

MR. JONES: Yes.

9

QUESTION: -- in footnote 14 of your brief.

10
11

MR. JONES: Although in the Tenth Circuit, we
were defending the tax court's ruling.

12

QUESTION: Yes, but for whatever reason, this

13

argument that you now say is so obvious on the face of the

14

Code, was this referred to in your argument to the Tenth

15

Circuit other than in a footnote, footnote 14 of your

16

brief?

17

MR. JONES: Well, you are expressing a close
familiarity with that and I don't remember footnote 14.
QUESTION: I didn't dig this out myself.
stated in your opponent's presentation.

It was

Is it inaccurate?

MR. JONES: It is -- I have recently looked at

22

our brief in the Tenth Circuit and my recollection of our

23

brief in the Tenth Circuit was that we made the same point

24

and we made the same argument in the context that the tax

25

court resolved the issue, which is that first they talked
27

1

about how it's all done at the corporate level.

2

having reached that conclusion, emphasized that there is

3

no item of income and no tax exempt income in connection

4

with this item.

5
6

And then

QUESTION: This does not constitute income.

You

made that explicit argument?

7

MR. JONES: Yes.

In fact, we noted that the

8

Treasury regulations have provided this for 70 years, long

9

before 61 was enacted, long before 108, and that the

10

courts had adopted the judicial insolvency exception, had

11

agreed with the Commissioner that no income arises from

12

the discharge of the debt of the insolvent.

13

QUESTION: Are there past cases in which the IRS

14

has argued that something is not income, or is this a

15

first?

16

MR. JONES: Well, it's an uncomfortable position

17

for us.

18

case properly without addressing that subject.

19

can't because Congress made that the fulcrum of its

20

legislative determination.

21

I mean, I would love to be able to resolve this
But we

QUESTION: You know, it seems a little

22

contradictory to say that under Section 108, the taxpayers

23

here have to pay some sort of tax whether you call it a

24

deferred tax or just a price on something that you say

25

isn't income of any type.

It just seems contradictory.
28

1

And I'm concerned, if we say it's not income, that there

2

may be other items that are currently considered to fall

3

within section 61 as income that all of a sudden we find

4

aren't.

5

--

6

And I don't know how far that would take us if we

MR. JONES: I don't know of any other.

And of

7

course I don't know if that provides you with any comfort,

8

but let me answer the first part of the question you

9

raised which is, are there other situations where

10

something that does not constitute income has an effect on

11

basis, or doesn't.

12

believe it's quoted in the appendix, is 1368(b).

13

1368(b) is a provision that says that if a Subchapter S

14

corporation has no earnings and profits and makes a

15

distribution to its shareholder, that won't be treated as

16

income and under 1367 it will reduce their basis.

The closest example, and I don't
And

17

Well, this is a similar determination.

18

something has happened here that puts the shareholders in

19

a position whether they might --

20
21

QUESTION: Excuse me.

If

That means it won't be

treated as income to the shareholder.

22

MR. JONES: Yes.

23

QUESTION: You are not talking about whether in

24

the abstract it's an item of income.

25

that it's not treated as an item of income because
29

They have to say

1

otherwise it normally would be.

2

MR. JONES: Well, actually, if you look at the

3

close words of the statute, it doesn't say that.

Section

4

61 begins with the phrase "except as otherwise provided,

5

discharge of a debt is not an item of income".

6

recognizes the historical distinction that Justice -- that

7

this Court had talked about in Commissioner versus Tufts,

8

in Justice Blackmun's opinion that the whole theory of the

9

discharge of indebtedness doctrine is that the discharge

10

frees up the assets of the debtors and he could use them

11

to --

And that

12

QUESTION: May we go back to the formulation that

13

gross income does not include? Well, that same formulation

14

is also used for tax exempt bond interest.

15

MR. JONES: Yes.

16

QUESTION: For life insurance proceeds, and even

17

though it says the same exact words, does not -- gross

18

income does not include, we know that those do up the

19

basis.

20

MR. JONES: Not as an item of income though.

21

They come in as tax exempt income.

22

for items of income including tax exempt income.

23

exempt income is something that really is income, and it's

24

an accretion to wealth.

It's an asset.

5

QUESTION: And forgiveness of indebtedness --

6

MR. JONES: Is not.

Forgiveness of indebtedness

for an insolvent, as Justice Blackmun pointed out in

any assets.

that use the words "gross income does not include". And I

say they are items of income. And obviously one thing I

would be reluctant to do is to take those same words

MR. JONES: But it should help you resolve that

problem because what's at issue was what was Congress's

intent when it used the phrase "items of income."

QUESTION: And are you saying it's always the

same, those words "gross income does not include" in those

29 subsections whatever they are referring to is never an

6

item of income or do you mean sometimes is and sometimes

7

isn't?

8
9
10

MR. JONES: I think I'm focused on your problem.
I think the answer to your question is probably that in
all of those instances it wouldn't be an item of income.

11

QUESTION: Never? What for example about a

12

lessor's income?

13

a lessor of a certain kind of rent which I thought surely

would increase basis.

recognized in subsequent periods.

QUESTION: Could you answer one other question

5

which is, -- but it's going to sound as if it's on your

6

side so be tempted to agree but don't agree because you

7

haven't pushed this argument and I want to know why.

8
9

It seemed to me that the strongest point was the
words keeping it at the corporate level. Because if you

10

kept it at the corporate level no problem I can think of

11

would be caused and it eliminate the loophole and seems

12

consistent with the language, but you have not pushed that

13

argument. And therefore there must be some disaster in tax

14

law lurking.

15

MR. JONES: We do. We put it as our second point.

16

We don't abandon that argument.

It's definitely addressed

17

in our brief. Its sort of an intellectual fussiness that

18

causes us to address the income issue first and then the

19

shareholder issue, I mean the corporate level issue.

20

that is because (d)(7) wasn't enacted, as Justice Ginsburg

21

pointed out until 1984.

22

ahead and said this is not to be treated as an item of

23

income; it's to be used to reduce attributes and it is to

24

have no further tax consequences.

25

look to 1984 legislation in (d)(7) to answer this

that we should undo the change that Congress made in 108.

4

And you are telling me, no, the change in 108 didn't do

5

anything? Or what?

6

MR. JONES: It didn't change the basic principles

7

of 108 that the amendment in 1984 simply said that the tax

attribute reduction would be applied at the corporate

level for Subchapter S corporations.

But what was the effect of

saying take it at the corporate level so that the

MR. JONES: Congress said that they were doing

that because they wanted all shareholders to be treated

22

the same.

23

That was the explanation that Congress gave.

corporation should be treated the same.

In other words

8

they didn't want to -- Congress said they didn't want to

9

have shareholder one to be treated differently from

10

shareholder two although as you are aware for partnerships

11

that kind of different treatment can result.

12

didn't think this had anything to do with - that the

13

change in 108(d)(7) had anything to do with the issue here

14

because they had already resolved the issue in 1980 when

15

they explained how these statutes were to work.

16

But Congress

And I want to point out that in 1993 when

17

Congress amended Section 108 to extend its application to

18

qualified real property indebtedness, Congress went

19

through the operation of these same provisions and said

20

the same thing.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION: But Congress was explicit there in a
way it isn't here.
MR. JONES: I don't know how Congress could have
been more explicit in-QUESTION: Didn't Congress say that there won't
37

1

be any increase in basis?

2

MR. JONES: That's true.

3

QUESTION: and here we don't have anything that

4

says it won't be an increase in basis.

5

MR. JONES: We have awfully good indication of

6

that.

We have Congress saying it's not income.

7

to be used to reduce tax attributes.

8

consequences.

It's only

It has no other tax

9

QUESTION: But you will concede that to say basis

10

will not be increased is something a lot clearer than what

11

you are presenting to us?

12
13

MR. JONES: Yes, it's perfectly clear.

But to me

it's -

14

QUESTION: So why didn't they make that same

15

statement with respect to this, knowing that the courts

16

were all over the lot?

17

MR. JONES: In 1980 the courts were not all over

18

the lot.

19

discharge of the debt of an insolvent was income.

20

In 1980 no court had ever suggested that the

21

QUESTION: What was the year of the real estate
provision?

22

MR. JONES: 93.

23

QUESTION: 93.

24
25

MR. JONES: Yes.
QUESTION: So I am asking about when they made
38

1

that change in 93 and they said basis will not be

2

increased.

3

same thing for subchapter S corporations?

4

Why didn't they just say, well, let's do the

MR. JONES: I am sorry. They were talking about

5

Subchapter S corporations in 1993.

6

about exactly the issue we have in this case.

7

They were talking

QUESTION: But I'm just simply asking you why

8

didn't they make that same change to say explicitly basis

9

will not be increased, since that would have cured --

10

MR. JONES: The statute wasn't amended in any of

11

its substantive characters in 93.

12

provision to the same statute

13

They just added another

QUESTION: Yes, but couldn't they have said "now

14

we are adding this provision.

15

thing explicit.

16

to make that same provision elsewhere."

17

And we are making this

To make the statute compatible we ought

MR. JONES: They were talking about, -- When they

18

said basis is not adjusted, they were talking about the

19

Subchapter S corporation provisions involved in this case.

20

So they were talking about previously enacted provisions

21

of Section 108 in describing how they applied.

22

QUESTION: There are certain words that are used.

23

MR. JONES: Basis is not increased by --

24

QUESTION: Yes.

25

And why wasn't it made clear

then? Basis is not increased, with respect to this
39

1

subchapter S?

2

MR. JONES: That is exactly what they said at

3

that the time in '93.

4

communicating.

5
6

QUESTION: No, we are not.
that says those words expressly.

7
8

It's just

QUESTION: I thought it was in the statute
itself.
MR. JONES: No, I am sorry. Now I understand.

It

was in the history of --

13
14

You are asking them -

legislative history.

11
12

We have a provision

MR. JONES: It's not a provision.

9
10

I'm sorry. We are not

QUESTION: Its not in the statute itself in any
case?

15

MR. JONES: It was in the history of the 93

16

amendment that Congress in going through how the statute

17

operates, explained that for subchapter S corporations

18

this is not an item of income; it doesn't adjust basis.

19

That is all I am saying.

20

binding history.

21

I am not saying that this is

QUESTION: Is there a provision of the Internal

22

Revenue Code that says basis will not be increased that

23

was a change that was made in the statute, not legislative

24

history?

25

MR. JONES: I am not familiar with that, but it
40

1

is just the contrary.

2

will be adjusted if there's an item of income.

3

Congress said this isn't and item of income.

4

that's -

5

The statute says only that basis
An
I know that

QUESTION: Perhaps I will look for it. It's that

6

real estate -- I am sure that you must be familiar with it

7

and I thought that in that statute itself those words

8

appeared.

9

MR. JONES: I am not familiar with that.

10

The contention that if it is not an item of

11

income then its tax exempt income is also fundamentally

12

flawed for the same reason. Its not tax exempt income

13

because its not an accretion to wealth. Its not income in

14

the first place.

15

QUESTION: Except that Section 61 of Title 26

16

says that income includes income from discharge of

17

indebtedness. I mean that's a germinal provision.

18
19

MR. JONES: It says "Except as otherwise provided
--"

20

QUESTION: Yes.

21

MR. JONES: Income includes income from discharge

22

--

23

QUESTION: So that is the normal rule.

24

MR. JONES: Well, that's the contingent rule. It

25

says except as otherwise provided, income includes income
41

1

from discharge. 108 says it does not include income from

2

discharge of an insolvent. And that is the 80 year history

3

of the Internal Revenue Code.

4

QUESTION: And it also says it does not include

5

income from a lot of other things. I mean, as Justice

6

Breyer was pointing out earlier, there are a lot of other

7

things as to which it says the same thing. And all it

8

means is that although gross income would normally mean

9

this, for purposes of subchapter S, it will not mean that.

10

But that does not mean -- it is in the abstract, not

11

income.

12

I thought the argument you are making here

13

MR. JONES: I don't have any objection to what

14

you just said. I think it is perfection correct. I think

15

it's a proper concern.

16

supposed to, what we have to resolve here is what did

17

Congress mean when it said items of income in 1366 because

18

that's what flows through. Congress said this is not an

19

item of income.

20

the debt of an insolvent. My only point about the

21

congruence of 61 and 108 is that they cannot win on those

22

provision because all those provision say is what we say:

23

It's not income.

24
25

But our point is that what you are

And I say this, I mean the discharge of

And what the legislative history of the
provisions say is exactly - is why we are here today
42

1

,which is that Congress has always said this isn't income.

2

Has never permitted it to have any tax consequences other

3

than attribute reduction. And I go back again to Victor

4

and Loken. I mean, they are a pretty objective neutral

5

source on this, and they agree with us, that this is not

6

the way Congress used the term and that after it is used

7

to reduce attributes, it's to be ignored.

8
9

The reason.

QUESTION: Was this some article in a law review
you are talking about.

10

MR. JONES: It's actually in their treatise.

11

QUESTION: In a treatise?

12

MR. JONES: Federal Income Taxation. It is a

13

pretty reliable guide.

14
15

QUESTION: How has the Court of Appeals come out
on this issue?

16

MR. JONES: The Court of Appeals have been sort

17

of all over the map.

18

in this case,--

19

If you are talking about the Court

JUSTICE: No, I meant just the Court of Appeals.

20

The Court or Appeals ruled for the government on this

21

issue.

22

MR. JONES: Yes.

23

JUSTICE: Have other Court of Appeals ruled

24
25

against the government on this point?
MR. JONES: Yes, The Third Circuit in the Farley
43

1

case ruled against the United States, saying that the

2

plain language of 108 makes this an item of income. And I

3

don't understand their reasoning because the plain

4

language of 108 says it is not an item of income.

5

clear history of the statute says it should never be

6

treated as one. And instead it is to be ignored after you

7

reduce basis. I mean after you reduce the tax attributes.

8
9
10

And the

QUESTION: In fact, no Court of Appeals has
agreed with the government on this point, has it? Is there
any Court of Appeals that has agreed with this argument?

11

MR. JONES: I don't think there is a Court of

12

Appeals that has gone through these arguments that we have

13

made the primary focus of our position in this court.

14

QUESTION: The answer is no.

15

MR. JONES: They haven't addressed them, Justice

16
17
18
19

Scalia.
QUESTION: Why didn't the government argue this
in the other courts?
MR. JONES: Again, I believe what we were doing

20

is that we were defending the rationale of the Tax Court.

21

QUESTION: Which you now disagree with?

22

MR. JONES: As I explained to Justice Breyer, we

23

think that the proper way to reach this, to analyze this

24

is the way Congress did, to start with 108 in 1980.

25

then to point out that the amendment to (d)(7) in 1984 was
44

And

1

consistent with that result and promoted that conclusion.

2

Now, what the Tax Court did was different.

3

Justice Breyer points out that all of this should be done

4

at the corporate level and nothing escapes to the

5

shareholders because it's all handled at the corporate

6

level.

They said, as

I think that's a correct conclusion.

7

But I think one of the reasons it's a correct

8

conclusion is because there is no item of income that can

9

escape to the shareholders and add to their basis and give

10

them this double tax benefit wind fall.

11

point out that in each of these cases when a basis

12

adjustment is allowed there is indeed a windfall there.

13

And I do want to

QUESTION: But that can't be controlling.

14

There's no reason to simply distort the tax code to avoid

15

a wind fall in this particular case.

16

MR. JONES: I don't its controlling but it is a

17

presumption that Congress doesn't intend to do that.

18

so when you look at these statutes and you have the clear

19

history, and if you have any uncertainty about the

20

application of the plain text of those provisions, that

21

uncertainty should be resolved to avoid creating -- either

22

denying the intention of Congress or creating the windfall

23

benefits.

25

QUESTION: I'm sorry.
refer to.
45

And

What's the presumption you

1

MR. JONES: The presumption is what this Court

2

said in Skelly Oil, that tax statutes should not be

3

interpreted to be provide the practical equivalent of a

4

double deduction, which is exactly what they have sought.

5

QUESTION: Could it not end up being a double tax

6

in the other direction? Let's assume an insolvent chapter

7

S corporation that later recovers.

8

9

that arises from this reduction of indebtedness and

All right.

The

therefore could not offset against any future gain that he

11

gets from the corporation.

Is that fair?

MR. JONES: I think that what you are pointing

13

out is exactly the opposite of how Congress looked this

14

situation.

15

16

year that the debt is discharged.
