CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now

3

in Number 00-292, C & L Enterprises

Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma.

v. the Citizen Band
Mr. Mashburn.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN DAVID MASHBURN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. MASHBURN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the court:

9

The Potawatomi Indian Tribe on August 25th,

10

1993 presented a contract to C & L Enterprises for the

11

construction of a roof upon a bank building that the tribe

12

was building off of the reservation.

13

The contract contained an arbitration provision

14

specifically adopting the rules of the American

15

Arbitration Association and also specifically providing

16

that the award, the arbitration award in such proceedings,

17

would be enforceable by judgment.

18

There is no question that the arbitration

19

agreement provided that the tribe waived its immunity as

20

to the American Arbitration Association and its

21

arbitration proceedings.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:
phrase.

There is no --

Well, but it didn't use the magic

It didn't say waive immunity.
MR. MASHBURN

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

we believe the standard, that no standard has required

1

that it specifically state we waive sovereign immunity.

2

Rather they clearly stated we agree to be brought into the

3

American Arbitration Association and to be subject to

4

arbitration, a binding arbitration.

5

They went further than that and they said in the

6

agreement we agree that a judgment may be entered upon

7

that.

8

QUESTION:

I understand.

9

MR. MASHBURN:

And the ambiguity that the

10

respondent attempts to raise is regarding which court is

11

being referred to where the phrase recites any court of

12

competent jurisdiction.

13

However, we believe that that argument of

14

ambiguity fails for four reasons.

15

Arbitration Association Rule 47C, which is incorporated by

16

the very terms of the clause, states that awards under

17

their procedures may be enforced as a judgement in any

18

federal or state court.

19

The contract itself selects Oklahoma law as

20

governing law in addition to this Court's rulings in

21

Mescalero, Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Potawatomi Organized

22

Village of Cocky.

23

goes off the reservation, it is subject to the substantive

24

laws of the state.

First, the American

1

mentioned anywhere in the contract.

2

is we don't believe the Tribal Court would have had

3

jurisdiction to even hear this case under the ruling in

4

Montana v. United States because it is undoubtedly non-

5

Indian not on the reservation.

6

QUESTION:

7

the suit in the Tribal Court?

8

jurisdiction?

9

But, what if the non-Indian brought

MR. MASHBURN:

10

QUESTION:

And the fourth reason

Why wouldn't it have

Because despite --

You must be suing on the arbitration

11

order.

12

tribal jurisdiction if you brought the suit.

13

It seemed to me you agreed on the objection of

MR. MASHBURN:

We believe that that type of

14

jurisdiction is in fact subject matter jurisdiction

15

because under the ruling in Montana v. United States, the

16

court indicated that tribes don't have jurisdiction to

17

hear matters unless it's been specifically given to them

18

by the Constitution or statute.

19

QUESTION:

But, there's a consensual exception

20

to Montana too, is there not, where there's a consensual

21

transaction between the tribe and a non-Indian?

22

MR. MASHBURN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

One of

23

the two exceptions that are carved out under Montana is

24

for a party that enters into a consensual agreement.

25

However, Montana doesn't even get to, we

believe, those exceptions until you find that it's on

2

reservation activity.

3

Montana and in the cases we've reviewed following that

4

regard on reservation activity.

5

QUESTION:

All of the activity discussed in

Now, if the very same clause were in

6

a contract that your client entered into with a state, do

7

you think that we would have found a waiver of Eleventh

8

Amendment immunity?

9
10
11

MR. MASHBURN:

Yes.

But, the question is more

difficult and if I could explain.
QUESTION:

I would have thought we wouldn't,

12

that our cases would have said not, that wouldn't be

13

enough to waive sovereign immunity.

14

MR. MASHBURN:

Under this Court's ruling in

15

Edelman v. Jordan regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity,

16

the Court stated that the rule is that the waiver, and

17

again this one applies, as you know, to Eleventh Amendment

18

immunity from suit in federal court, but the courts even

19

there stated that the ruling regarding whether a provision

20

waives such immunity is that it must be stated by the most

21

express language or by such overwhelming implications from

22

the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable

23

construction.

24

And in this situation, under the same

25

circumstances, we believe that that standard would find a

(800) FOR DEPO

1

waiver because there is no other reasonable construction

2

of this clause when you take what the clause incorporates.

3

And in fact, in this Court's ruling in Port

4

Authority v. Feeney, and subsequently in Kimmel v. Florida

5

Board of Regents, the Court recognized that the consent

6

provision may look to other provisions.

7

Authority, it looked to a venue provision.

8

it looked for an ADA claim; it looked to the Fair Label

9

Standards Act and found--

10

QUESTION:

In the Port
And in Kimmel,

Well, do you concede, Mr. Mashburn,

11

that an Indian tribe has the same sort of immunity as the

12

state under the Eleventh Amendment?

13

MR. MASHBURN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, we do not.

14

We believe that that is peculiar to the states and that

15

that at the very most is the highest standard that this

16

Court should apply and we don't believe that that is

17

appropriate for an Indian tribe.

18

QUESTION:

Well, in some ways, Indian tribes

19

have been given more immunity than states, hasn't that

20

been the --

21

MR. MASHBURN:

There is some discussion of that

22

in the dissenting opinion in Cairo that it appears that

23

that's what the Court is doing.

24

that's what the Court intended to do.

25

don't believe that that's the rule that should be followed

We don't believe that
And certainly, we

1

here.

2

We believe that the Court should find a waiver

3

if there is simply a clear statement that using the usual

4

rules of contract construction that the tribe agreed that

5

upon a breach it could be brought to court and sued for

6

the breach of that contract.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Mashburn, as this respects

8

foreign sovereigns, Congress in 1988 made the specific

9

provision that if you agreed to an arbitration dispute

10

settlement mechanism, then you have no immunity.

11

Congress did that by statute and doesn't that imply that

12

when Congress doesn't do it by statute, the immunity

13

persists?

14

MR. MASHBURN:

The

No, Your Honor, we don't believe

15

that it does.

16

has to be drawn.

17

attempting to bring some uniformity to a variation of

18

rules that had been applied.

19

And in fact, as this Court recited the history of

20

foreign sovereign immunity in the Cairo case, there had

21

been a move from virtually no immunity to virtually total

22

immunity under I believe it was the Tate Letter.

23

then, shrinking back from that, and then applying implied

24

consent from commercial operations.

25

First of all, we believe that a distinction
In that instance, Congress was

We don't believe that the fact that they acted

1

there to specifically provide that as a waiver indicates

2

where they have not acted that there is no waiver.

3

fact, we believe the Court can take guidance from the

4

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and from cases leading up

5

to that finding waivers from entering into commercial

6

relations, or in particular arbitration agreements, and

7

find that that is within the appropriate policy that the

8

United States has followed.

9

QUESTION:

And in

You don't take the position do you,

10

maybe you do, that any arbitration agreement necessarily

11

implies the waiver of sovereign immunity?

12

MR. MASHBURN:

No, Your Honor, I believe you

13

have to look to the specific term here in the arbitration

14

agreement.

15

QUESTION:

You're dealing with this one.

16

MR. MASHBURN:

That's correct.

But, as a

17

general rule, we believe that if the arbitration

18

agreement, first of all, if it incorporates rules, as this

19

one does from the American Arbitration Association, then

20

we think it's perfectly appropriate for the Court to look

21

to those rules and the parties are both on notice that

22

those rules are going to govern the procedures.

23

in international law that had generally allowed suit on

2

commercial transactions by states.

3

open to us to apply such a rule to the sovereign immunity

4

of Indian tribes, which we made up ourselves anyway,

5

right?

6

MR. MASHBURN:

Why do you think it's

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

7

it is correct that it was simply a codification of what

8

was the emerging case law in the field.

9

appropriate for this Court to draw a waiver rule as

It certainly is

10

lenient

11

certainly no more strict than the Eleventh Amendment

12

Waiver Rule.

13

that because, as Your Honor has stated, this Court

14

recognized in Cairo that it is a court created doctrine.

15

Especially in the context that it tends to impinge on the

16

state's rights and be court created, we believe there's

17

even more argument for the Court to move cautiously in;

18

certainly in expanding any immunity that has been afforded

19

to Indian tribes.

20

as the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Rule, and

And this Court has complete authority to do

QUESTION:

Mr. Mashburn, even if you could --

21

you've agreed the agreement is saying yes, they agreed for

22

arbitration.

23

they are going to resolve this through arbitration.

24

where do you get tied to that, that the Court to enforce

25

the arbitration award would be a state court?

That's explicit right out there that but

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

But,

There is no

1

explicit agreement due to that by the tribe, is there?

2

MR. MASHBURN:

No, Your Honor, we believe that

3

there is and the reason that there is is because first of

4

all it adopts the American Arbitration Association rule

5

which says the award may be enforced in state or federal

6

court.

7

Secondly, it adopts Oklahoma's Arbitration Act,

8

which says that the award may be enforced in any court of

9

the state.

And we believe when you combine that with the

10

fact that, in our opinion, the Tribal Court would have had

11

jurisdiction, there is no ambiguity that the court that is

12

being selected is not the Tribal Court.

13

So, the only other alternative would be to argue

14

that the term, that the provision was meaningless and that

15

it was selecting no court.

16

that that argument holds water because the parties had

17

adopted Oklahoma law specifically.

18

adopted the American Arbitration Association rules.

19

And under both of those bodies of law, the forum

20

is either, you know, from a state court or a federal

21

court, not the Tribal Court.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

But, we don't even believe

The parties have

The reason that the Tribal Court

would not have had jurisdiction is -MR. MASHBURN:

unless there was specific statute or constitutional

2

provision providing for jurisdiction over civil matters by

3

the Indian tribe, that it did not have jurisdiction over

4

non-Indian off the reservation.

5
6

QUESTION:

So, even if, are there, is there a

Tribal Court?

7

MR. MASHBURN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

And has it had any arbitration

proceedings?

10

MR. MASHBURN:

Not in this case.

No parties --

QUESTION:

Have they asserted jurisdiction over

arbitration in other cases?

MR. MASHBURN:

I'm not aware of whether they

have or not, Your Honor.

16

any action in Tribal Court in this case at any time.

QUESTION:

No party has attempted to bring

21

wouldn't have thought Montana would be a barrier.

That arose in the context of a Tribal Court or a

Court.

question.

And if the Court views that as more a personal

jurisdiction question, then certainly a non-Indian party

could consider it in that court.

QUESTION:

All right.

Assume you lose in this

Court on the interpretation of the contract, I take it

11

that the tribe would say that they're immune from suit in

12

their own court as well.

13

MR. MASHBURN:

Is that correct?
I'm sure that they would assert

14

that they are immune from suit in their court.

15

clarify one matter though for your previous question, Your

16

Honor.

17

I need to

There is some question because the agreement

incorporates the American Arbitration Association rules

QUESTION:

Mr. Mashburn, you are now retreating

4

from a position that you started out originally because

5

you answered Justice O'Connor's question if we're talking

6

about personal jurisdiction, of course, you can submit to

7

personal jurisdiction.

8

But, before that, you were taking a position

9

about the subject matter jurisdiction of Tribal Courts.

10

You were saying that parties can't confer subject matter

11

jurisdiction on the court.

12

reasoning, then your answer to Justice O'Connor should

13

have been no.

14

These courts are simply powerless to entertain

15

the case where one of the litigants is a non-member and

16

the episode and suit occurred off reservation, you started

out, are you abandoning that position?

ON BEHALF OF TEXAS, AS AMICUS CURIAE

Mr.

12

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. COLEMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the court:
Respondent waived its immunity from suit when it

13

entered into a contract expressing its willingness to

14

submit to binding arbitration and judicial confirmation of

15

the arbitration award in state court.

16

We think that the test should be with respect to

17

evaluating a waiver of tribal immunity whether the

18

contract states a waiver by sufficiently expressed

19

language or by overwhelming implication from the text such

20

that by applying the traditional rules of construction,

21

the only reasonable interpretation is that the tribe

22

intended to subject itself to suit on the contract.

23

QUESTION:

What about a forum selection clause?

24

Would that comply with your test because you want to know

25

what that says?

But, the standard forum selection clause?

MR. COLEMAN:

I think if the contract otherwise

2

says we agree to be sued, and there is a forum selection

3

clause, that those together certainly would be effective.

QUESTION:

But, it's not if it just says in any

dispute between the parties the laws of the State of New

6

York will apply?

8

That wouldn't do it?

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't believe that that would do

it, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

Would this clause have sufficed to

waive state sovereign immunity for Eleventh Amendment

11

purposes if it were state instead of a tribe?

MR. COLEMAN:

I believe not, Your Honor, for a

couple of different reasons.

14

that the states have set for waiving their own immunity

15

are matters of state law and the states have adopted a

16

variety of standards so one can't speak of a uniform

17

standard of waiver.

18

First of all, the standards

But, more importantly, the Eleventh Amendment

19

developed in a different way.

20

that the states didn't have immunity from suit in federal

court.

23

government to protect the states from suit.

from the state's own sovereign immunity with respect to

waiver.

With that in part -QUESTION:

How about cases that have delineated

a narrower immunity for tribes, Indian tribes?
MR. COLEMAN:

This Court has stated a standard

7

from time with respect to waivers.

But, the Court has not

8

really been in the position of having been asked

9

specifically what that standard is.

10

So, the language from Santa Clara Pueblo has

11

simply come forward to the state without really being used

12

in any specific case and without being tested.

13

is what is at issue today before the Court.

14

QUESTION:

And that

You're asking us to adopt a rather

15

confusing body of law.

16

17

sovereign immunity and another for the state and, why

18

should we do that?

MR. COLEMAN:

We have one set of standards for

insufficient to waive immunity if it were the state that

was involved.

MR. COLEMAN:

Because the Eleventh Amendment

contains a specific requirement as to federal court.

you about the Eleventh Amendment.

sovereign immunity pursuant in the state's own courts?

MR. COLEMAN:
Stevens.

It could be a waiver of

Let me correct my answer, Justice

I didn't understand it in that way.

If there

10

were authorization to waive a state's immunity in this

11

fashion, then we believe that it could be waived by this

12

kind of language.

13

QUESTION:

What's the answer then?

That they

14

say the words, this agreement shall be specifically

15

enforceable in any court having jurisdiction means in any

16

Tribal Court having jurisdiction, and why doesn't it mean

17

that?

18

What's wrong with their argument?

19

MR. COLEMAN:

So, why -- I mean that's a possible reading.

We have two basic arguments.

One

20

is that we agree with the petitioner here that the subject

21

matter of jurisdiction of the Tribal Courts is limited by

22

Montana and by Straight.

23

And that therefore, because this is a contract

24

involving off reservation commercial activities, the

25

Tribal Court's jurisdiction cannot extend to this type of

activity.

And therefore, there could be no expectation by

2

either party that the arbitration confirmation would be in

3

Tribal Court.

4

We also would argue --

QUESTION:

Let me just interrupt you if I may.

What is it that imposes the limit on the Tribal Court's

jurisdiction?

20

MR. COLEMAN:

Going back to the basic analysis

21

that this court laid out in Kennecott Copper, it talked

22

about the fact that state courts are courts of general

23

jurisdiction.

24

are the only courts of general jurisdiction.

25

And in our dual system, the state courts

1

there is a question when you say any court of competent

2

jurisdiction that that means state court.

3

Courts themselves are courts of very limited jurisdiction

4

and it's not clear that saying any court of competent

5

jurisdiction would ratchet down to the Tribal Court, but

6

would rather continue to apply to the state court,

7

particularly when the contract is adopting state law.

8

It incorporates the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration

Act, which defines the only court under that act that can

QUESTION:

It seems rather strange to me that

12

they can agree to an arbitration by the American

13

Arbitration Association, which is a private body, but then

14

they couldn't further agree that the arbitration would be

15

enforceable in an Indian Court.

MR. COLEMAN:

activity, there is probably that ability.

there has been any agreement to do that.

Tribal Court, there could have been an objection that they

2

had not followed the arbitration rules which were

3

incorporated which they agreed to.

4

They were bound by those rules as much as the

5

tribe was and they simply could not under their agreement

6

bring that confirmation action in Tribal Court.

7

why we think under these circumstances that the tribe

8

waived its immunity as to a confirmation suit in Tribal

9

Court.

10

That is

And we think also that the United States

11

discussion of Finney in its brief suggests that if they

12

were to view the arbitration agreement as more than a

13

simple agreement to arbitrate, but to evaluate the

14

incorporation of those arbitration rules, as was the state

15

statute in Finney and as this court considered by

16

reference in Kimmel, that they too would agree that there

17

has been a sufficient pointing to the court that the

18

action should be brought in, that this agreement taken as

19

a whole and interpreted according to the usual rules of

20

construction, clearly indicates the tribe was willing to

21

subject itself not merely to suit generally, but also to

suit or more specifically to suit in Oklahoma State Court

I'm quoting it from page of the blue
The relevant -- page six on the blue

The relevant language in the middle of the block

quotes is this "The award rendered by the arbitrators",

12

I'm skipping "shall be final and judgment may be entered

upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court

That reference to jurisdiction thereof has to

20

When they agree that in effect they will

jurisdiction, and when they agree that they are subject to

any court having that subject matter jurisdiction, isn't

that a pretty clear waiver and doesn't it go beyond

Why?
This language, as we pointed out

MR. MINNIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So, it gave the other side a piece of

paper that says arbitration and the whole thing was a

deception.

MR. MINNIS:

It was illusory?
Well, it is a deception in terms of

a party who is not -- if you say that the parties aren't

charged to know the law, which in Oklahoma they are.

And

10

the law is that you have to have a waiver by the Tribal

Government or the state government.

12

QUESTION:

It's not deceptive.

There is also a rule, isn't there, in

13

most common-law jurisdictions that parties deal in good

is just illusory as you interpret this contract to be?

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

In Kiowa Tribe, this Court recognized that

Indian tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit in state

13

courts with respect to both the governmental and

14

commercial activities.

15

waived that immunity, this Court applies the same

16

stringent standard that is applied -- that it applies in

determining whether a state, or the United States, has

waived its immunity from suit.

Well, we certainly don't mean that

unequivocal means one thing for a state and one thing for

a tribe.

11

unequivocal expression and the Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache

12

Tribe, the court addressed the question of whether because

Indian tribes had different attributes of their

14

sovereignty than the states, or the United States, a

15

different waiver standard ought to apply.

16

The court has expressed the standard as

QUESTION:

But, what's unequivocal?

It may mean

something different when you're talking about a state

court and when you're talking about a Tribal Court.

bring suit in any court having jurisdiction thereof, if

1

But, if I entered into this agreement with a tribe with

2

respect to real estate off of the tribal reservation, the

notion of a Tribal Court just wouldn't enter into my mind

when it spoke about in accordance with applicable law in

MR. GARRE:

Well, that sort of interpretation I

12

think goes beyond the four corners of the document that

the Court would be construing.

14

unequivocal waivers has always limited its analysis to the

language of the statute of contract.

would be the same when you're dealing with a tribe simply

2

because who thinks of any court having jurisdiction

3

thereof as a Tribal Court.

4

MR. GARRE:

But, the Court of course has said

5

that in the context of the state in the Kennecott Copper

6

case and in the College Savings case.

7

that makes sense as a rule of construction, that a

8

sovereign as a presumption would only intend to consent to

suit if it were going to consent to suit in its own courts

And we think that

and not another sovereign's courts.

Yes, but doesn't that presumption

operate in circumstances in which the state is making

MR. GARRE:

application of the rules of the American Arbitration

Now, why isn't that part and parcel of the

that's all that were here, then the separate arbitration

enforcement provision would not be necessary.

And moreover, whatever ambiguity that is

resolved by the fact that the rules provide for

arguing that this might be in Tribal Court.

in the contract as in any other contract case.

2

reviewing this language, we believe that the language does

3

not unequivocally express the tribe's --

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

And in

But, didn't the agreement

5

incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration

6

Association which refer to federal or state court and

7

don't mention Indian Tribal Court?

8
9

MR. GARRE:

As I said, the agreement says

arbitration shall be in accordance with that.

There would

10

be no need for the separate enforcement provision of the

11

clause if the reference -- if the parties thought that the

12

reference to the rules alone resolved that.

13

And the fact that the contract doesn't contain

14

the federal or state court limitation that's in the rules

15

simply introduces ambiguity as to whether the parties

16

intentionally omitted that.

17

Now, with respect to the choice of law

18

provision, we don't think that the separate choice of law

19

provision itself can unequivocally express the tribe's

20

consent to suit in state court.

21

And moreover, the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration

22

Act by its terms is inapplicable to the contract in this

23

case because that act only applies to agreements which

24

provide for arbitration in this state.

25

in this case did not provide for arbitration in Oklahoma.

So, that act doesn't apply.

2

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't you say it

3

provided for arbitration in Oklahoma by virtue of the fact

4

that it could be brought in any court of competent

5

jurisdiction?

6

MR. GARRE:

I think that gets back to the

7

question of what courts would have competent jurisdiction.

8

But, it is -- given the plain meaning to the language,

9

providing for jurisdiction in this state we think that the

10

conflict - that the law requires that the arbitration
