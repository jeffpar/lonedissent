CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Corporation v. United Mine Workers of America.

6

Mr. Roberts.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Twice the driver in this case tested positive

12

for illegal drugs, and twice the company that employed him

13

to drive its 25-ton vehicles in West Virginia tried to

14

fire him.

15

reinstated.

16

arguing that the reinstatement award should not be

17

enforced because it was contrary to public policy to put

18

this driver back behind the wheel.

19

Each time an arbitrator ordered the driver
The second time the company went to court,

The district court and the court of appeals,

20

however, rejected that argument and concluded that because

21

reinstatement was not illegal, the public policy exception

22

to the enforceability of contracts, quote, does not apply,

23

unquote.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, did the company have any

provision in the collective bargaining agreement about
3

1
2

what it was going to do for positive drug testing?
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

The agreement said that in

3

the case of a positive drug test the driver was subject to

4

sanctions up to and including termination, and the

5

arbitrator concluded that in this case they hadn't

6

established just cause.

7

That, of course, is the predicate for the

8

application of the public policy exception in every case,

9

the fact that the contract provides a result that is

10

different from the one the parties are arguing for under

11

public policy.

12

QUESTION:

How do you read Department of

13

Transportation regulations on this?

14

extensive, and as I read them it doesn't expressly cover

15

what happens for a second violation.

16

to do something that I guess they didn't adopt.

17
18

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROBERTS:

22

There was a proposal

Yes, there was a proposal, and it

was just not adopted.

19

21

They're quite

Yeah.
We don't know if it was because it

was regarded as too strict or not strict enough.
QUESTION:

So is it within the provisions of the

23

regulations actually adopted that an employee could be

24

restored to driving a truck under these circumstances?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Certainly after one positive test.
4

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. ROBERTS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5

After a -The question of a --

It just doesn't say.
No.

The question of a recidivist

is not addressed by the regulations at all.

6

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

What the regulations provide --

8

and we agree with the Solicitor General's reading of the

9

regulations.

We don't take issue with it -- is that in a

10

case of a positive drug test a couple of things have to

11

happen.

12

pass the minimum requirements, which is just evaluation by

13

a substance abuse professional and pass a return-to-work

14

test, and then whether or not the driver gets his job back

15

is left to private ordering.

16

The driver, before he can go back to work, has to

Now, if that private ordering takes the form of

17

a contract, a collective bargaining agreement, that

18

contract should be subject to the public policy exception

19

just like every other contract is.

20

QUESTION:

There is not --

Why, Mr. Roberts, because you could

21

have said expressly, you didn't have to as a contracting

22

party rely on what a court might or might not declare to

23

be the public policy.

24

gets tested and shows up positive twice, he's out.

25

could have said that.

Could you have not said, a driver
You

You could have negotiated for that.
5

1

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we could have tried.

2

Whether or not it would have been the result of the

3

collective bargaining practice is another question.

4
5

QUESTION:

But you didn't, you didn't do that,

or we don't know.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

The arbitrator determined that we

7

didn't, I think is the best way to put it.

8

under this court's decision in Kaiser Steel, though, even

9

if we had signed a contract that was illegal, we'd still

10

Now -- but

have standing to object to that.

11

QUESTION:

Yes, but I'm just trying to make the

12

narrow point that an employer could bargain for a rule

13

that says you test positive for drugs twice, and you're

14

out, could bargain for such a rule.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

that.

17

public policy exception.

Yes.

18
19
20

There's no question about

Again, all that does is pose the question under the

QUESTION:

Well then it would make that academic

or moot if you had it in the contract.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, if the union agreed to it,

21

if it were phrased in such a way that it were not subject

22

to an arbitrator's misinterpretation, and it's also the

23

case that it may not be the best result.

24
25

QUESTION:

There are such contracts, as I

understand it -6

1

MR. ROBERTS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Yes.

-- are there not?
Yes.

They'd make it explicit where the

first time, second time, you're out, period.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, there are some contracts.

In

7

other cases unions have resisted them, and in other cases

8

perhaps the employer recognizes that an absolute rule may

9

not be the best result.

10

QUESTION:

So in other words, what you're

11

seeking, then, would be a rule that says the public policy

12

kicks in if the employer wants to discharge this person,

13

but suppose the employer would say, we're going to give

14

him a second chance, even a third chance, there would be

15

no public policy to come into that picture.

16

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right, and for a very

17

important reason, is because the doctrine that we're

18

talking about is a doctrine of contract law.

19

applies when the question of the enforcement of a contract

20

is at issue.

21

public policy role for the courts, and --

22

It only

That is an important limitation on the

QUESTION:

But in other words you are saying the

23

bottom line rule that you're urging is that you ought to

24

be permitted, if you so choose, to discharge this man, but

25

if you do not so choose, then there's no -- there's

7

1
2

nothing that -MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, but there is something very

3

much that constrains the company's choice in that

4

situation, and that's tort law.

5

that informs the exercise of the public policy exception

6

when the court is asked to enforce the contract restrains

7

what the company can do on its own unilaterally.

8
9

QUESTION:

The same public policy

Well, I want to get into that, but

just before we leave this last question, if the company

10

had a contract that said three strikes and you're out,

11

would that contradict public -- but not two and not one,

12

would that contradict public policy?

13
14

MR. ROBERTS:

If the -- the question would come

up when someone wanted to enforce a contract.

15

QUESTION:

16

you're out, not two, not one.

17

employer comes and says, well, you know, this violates

18

public policy, we want him out.

19

The contract says three strikes and

MR. ROBERTS:

Then on the second time the

Yes, it would not prevent the

20

application of the public policy exception.

21

every case that the question comes up, whether it's this

22

case or the Kensington --

23
24
25

QUESTION:
the employer.

The -- in

So that would be a valid argument by

In other words, he --

MR. ROBERTS:

It would not prevent the court -8

1

QUESTION:

There is in your view a public policy

2

which would prohibit a three-strikes clause of the kind I

3

describe?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, what it would prohibit,

5

depending on the circumstances, and the Town of Newton

6

case said this is a very fact-intensive inquiry on the

7

court's part, when the court is asked to enforce the two

8

strikes, and he should be fired, the fact that the

9

contract provided three strikes doesn't act as an absolute

10

bar.

11

question comes up that the contract provides something

12

else.

13

It is always the case when the public policy

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Roberts, you've referred to

14

the public policy exception several times.

15

state your version of the public policy exception?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

Would you

The public policy exception

17

is the one this Court articulated in Town of Newton, which

18

is that courts have not only the authority but the

19

obligation to decline to enforce contracts that are

20

illegal or that violate public policy.

21

Now, to determine whether they violate public

22

policy, what this Court did was adopt the Restatement

23

test, one that has been developed over centuries of common

24

law, which asks whether the interests in enforcing the

25

agreement are outweighed in the circumstances by a public
9

1

policy harm by the enforcement of the agreement.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's just kind of boiler plate.
Well --

I mean, how would you -- can you

amplify it at all?

6

MR. ROBERTS:

Certainly.

The public policy in

7

this case is the public policy against the use of illegal

8

drugs by those in safety-sensitive positions.

9

policy is well-defined, because Congress and the executive

Now, that

10

have said what those positions are, not the courts.

11

Congress and the executive have said it covers these

12

substances, not the courts, and the policy is so strong

13

that Congress has said, we're going to test you to make

14

sure that the policy is implemented, and Congress and the

15

executive have said how that testing should be done, and

16

how often.

17
18
19

The courts -QUESTION:

How does the policy differentiate

between two strikes and three strikes?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, at that point you get into

20

the fact-intensive weighing that this Court in Town of

21

Newton says, said has to be done.

22

have to look at all of the circumstances and determine

23

whether that policy --

24
25

QUESTION:

In other words, you

Does that mean any -- one judge might

say, well, one strike's enough for me, that's the end of
10

1

the ball game?

2

MR. ROBERTS:

3

QUESTION:

Well --

Another judge might say, two strikes,

4

and still another might say three strikes.

5

which is the right number?

6

MR. ROBERTS:

How do we know

With respect to the one strike I

7

think the regulations would prevent that in most

8

situations, because they contemplate that in some

9

circumstances you can be reinstated, so there should not

10
11

be an absolute rule of one strike and you're out.
Now, the objection Your Honor raises is the same

12

objection that could have been raised in the Town of

13

Newton case.

14

agreement violates the policies underlying section 1983?

15

It's an objection that has been raised with respect to the

16

public policy exception since the beginning.

17

the Muschany case and even before that.

18

How do you tell which release dismissal

Go back to

And yet the exception has endured because the

19

courts have recognized that if courts do not ensure that

20

contracts do not violate public policy, no one else can.

21
22

QUESTION:

Whenever the policy applies, I take

it it trumps the contract.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Absolutely, yes.

What do you look to for -- now,

you've talked about the DOT regulations, which obviously
11

1

have some -- are there other sources to be relied on here?

2

You say something about the congressional -- in testing --

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, one -- yes -- well, in the

4

testing, but what the Court said in Muschany, repeated in

5

Grace and in Misco, is, courts just don't pluck these

6

policies out of the air.

7

legal precedents.

8

regulations, the drug-free work place acts, and one thing

9

they establish is a strong policy of deterrence.

10

You have to look to the laws and

You look to the testing act, the DOT

They didn't think that by imposing this testing

11

regime they would catch everybody who's using drugs.

12

they thought was, if people knew they were going to be

13

tested and consequences were going to flow from that,

14

people would stop using drugs.

15

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- do we say there's a

16

firm public policy that a repeat offender may not be

17

restored to a job affecting public safety?

18

MR. ROBERTS:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROBERTS:

21

Yes.

I think --

Is that the policy?
I think it is.

QUESTION:

23

as part of that determination?

25

Now, there may

be --

22

24

What

How -- and do we look to the DOT regs

MR. ROBERTS:

I -- first of all, I think that's

the policy as a general matter.
12

I don't think -- again,

1

this is not an area where the Court adopts general

2

categorical rules.

3

years apart, or something like that, perhaps in that

4

situation it doesn't make sense to say you cannot be

5

reinstated.

6

For example, if the two tests are 15

That of course is not the situation here.

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, the indeterminacy of all

7

this I think is what is bothering a lot of us, and let me

8

put the question slightly different from the way others

9

have done.

10

It seems to me that in considering a public

11

policy exception here we are in a different -- we at this

12

particular Court in this context are in a different

13

position from courts simply sitting in the traditional

14

common law circumstances in which you have two independent

15

contracting parties, and we're in a different position

16

because in fact we've got a labor contract here, and we

17

have a body of law which I assume we can rely on which

18

places tremendous value on the process of arbitration

19

under CVA and respect for the arbitrator's agreement --

20

determination.

21

So that if we are going to provide a public

22

policy, or recognize a public policy exception here, it

23

seems to me that it's got to be one in which the force of

24

the public policy thought to be inconsistent with the

25

arbitrator's award has got to be very, very, very clear
13

1

and strong and so on.

2

of public policy that might satisfy a traditional common

3

law context.

4

It's not the kind of, or the degree

Given the high degree of persuasiveness that the

5

policy has got to have to overcome these presumptions, is

6

there any way, practical way to administer it short of

7

what the Court did, and that in effect is to say, look,

8

you've got to have inconsistency with positive law?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, first of all, the

10

application of the exception is in no way inconsistent

11

with the deference to arbitrators.

12

which involved --

13

QUESTION:

In the Grace case,

Well, it is if you set the strength

14

of the policy too low.

15

the policy has got to be.

16

MR. ROBERTS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, that depends on how strong
If --

You have --

Go ahead.
You have a common law rule that

19

authorizes and obligates courts to apply this, and the

20

argument, as I understand it, and it is the union's

21

argument, is that you should have an exception to that

22

rule in the labor area because we defer to arbitrators,

23

but we defer to arbitrators because they have expertise in

24

the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.

25

That is not the question when it comes to public policy.
14

1

As this Court --

2

QUESTION:

Well, except that up to a point it

3

is, because as I understand the DOT regs in effect -- I

4

think the phrase that has been used, leave the issue of

5

when you can fire, or whether you can fire for a repeat

6

offense, to private ordering, so it is in fact an issue of

7

the meaning of the contract, and the arbitrator is right

8

smack in the middle of what the arbitrator is best at

9

doing when the arbitrator makes a decision like this.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, no.

That depends on what

11

the collective bargaining agreement provides, and

12

collective bargaining agreements do not shape public

13

policy.

14

employer and a union, and as this --

15

They shape a private agreement between an

QUESTION:

No, they don't, but the -- when the

16

agreement -- when the private ordering addresses this

17

subject, and the arbitrator is applying that agreement,

18

the arbitrator is acting in sort of a quintessential

19

arbitrator's role, so that it's quite true the arbitrator

20

doesn't -- isn't a separate source, perhaps, of public

21

policy, but the arbitrator's decision is entitled to the

22

greatest deference that it's ever entitled to.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

As this Court said in the Wright

24

decision, the deference that is accorded arbitrators is

25

limited by the rationale that supports it.
15

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, do you agree that an

2

arbitrator's decision arbitrating a collective bargaining

3

agreement is somehow entitled to more weight than an

4

arbitrator interpreting a provision under the Federal

5

Arbitration Act?

6

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

I think they're

7

both entitled to the same weight, and all that the

8

arbitrator's decision does is tell you what the parties

9

agreed to.

10

They say, this interpretation is binding on

the parties.

11

Well, that just poses the question that is

12

presented.

13

policy doctrine you assume that the parties have agreed to

14

something else.

15

signed an agreement limiting her -- the liability of the

16

company to 250 francs.

17

When you have an application of the public

In the Kensington case, Mrs. Bleaker

QUESTION:

All right, so in this case, then, to

18

get right to the facts of it, which -- facts-intensive, we

19

assume that the parties agreed that an appropriate remedy

20

for a person who is found with marijuana twice, and there

21

are extenuating circumstances, is a $10,000 fine, in

22

effect, and rehabilitation, and reinstatement if he tests

23

negative.

24
25

Now, how can we say that's against public
policy?

If you were in California the criminal law
16

1

provides the most severe penalty that could be attached to

2

a second possession of 26 grams is a $100 fine.

3

we have 30 million people in the State of California

4

saying a $100 fine is the appropriate thing.

5

Virginia, I take the highest fine would have been $1,000

6

under the criminal law.

7

So here

In West

And now here, the arbitrator says it's going to

8

be $10,000 and testing negative, rehabilitation,

9

reinstatement, so how could we say in this case it's

10

against public policy and he has to be fired?

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Because the criminal sanctions

12

that Your Honor addressed don't take into account what the

13

contract enforcement is going to bring about, and that is,

14

putting this individual, who in the course of 15 months

15

failed two tests for illegal drugs, behind the wheel of a

16

25-ton vehicle on the roads in West Virginia.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but how does the -- how does a

18

court know that that individual, when he gets behind the

19

wheel on Monday morning, is any more of a risk to the

20

people on the road than the guy who had three martinis on

21

Saturday night and is sober on Monday morning and gets in

22

the truck?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Again --

How do we -- how does a court know

that?
17

MR. ROBERTS:

2

Congress told it that.

3

testing act.

when you're there performing the functions, because you

5

have to be sober.

6

7
8

The court knows that because
Congress drew a distinction in the

It said, when we test for alcohol we test

It's all right if you're going to have

And it took a different approach when it came to
illegal drugs.

9

It said where --

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, may I ask you if the

10

arbitrator had left leeway to the employer to put this

11

person in a nonsafety-sensitive job, then would you say,

12

well -- what would you say about public policy then?

13

The -- everything is the same, that he gets stopped

14

$10,000 or whatever it was pay, and he has to go through

15

the drug rehabilitation program, and at the end of the

16

line the employer can put him back in a nonsafety

17

sensitive position.

18

MR. ROBERTS:

The issue there would be whether

19

that undermined the deterrent effect of the testing

20

program.

21

drugs and putting the lives of the traveling public at

22

risk is you get a desk job rather than you're behind the

23

wheel, that would undermine what Congress was trying to

24

do.

25

In other words, if the consequence for taking

QUESTION:

Would the public -- would the
18

1

argument -- in other words, you're telling me that the

2

public policy as you perceive it would say, this person is

3

out, even if there's a nonsafety-sensitive job that he

4

could be given?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

In the -- on the facts of this

6

case, in other words a second positive test, not the first

7

test, I think yes, although the argument for public policy

8

would not be as strong.

9

QUESTION:

10

Then why -- I'm sorry.

MR. ROBERTS:

I was just going to emphasize that

11

what Congress sought to achieve, and what the Department

12

of Transportation is seeking to achieve, is deterrence,

13

and if the consequences are so minimal, as in Your Honor's

14

hypothetical, that undermines the deterrent effect.

15

do the other drivers who are subject to this test take it

16

seriously, when they see someone who's failed twice --

17

QUESTION:

$10,000 is minimal?

How

I mean, if the

18

Department of Transportation had adopted its reg that

19

favors your position, I take it they would have insisted

20

on a 60-day suspension.

21

it had been adopted, then it would have been satisfied

22

here.

23
24

MR. ROBERTS:

They didn't even adopt it, but if

Well, Your Honor, we don't know

why they didn't adopt it.

They may not have adopted it --

All right.

I see, yes.

QUESTION:

Was -- that's true.

What about

$10,000?

5

across the country, why is $10,000 a minimal -- a minimal

6

sanction for an ordinary worker who is a driver of a

7

truck?

8
9

I mean, why is $10,000 in light -- if you went

That sounds like a lot of money to me.
MR. ROBERTS:

Because when you're dealing with a

second offense, someone who failed the first drug test

10

they had to take, then failed another one given 14 months

11

after they were reinstated, after they had been through

12

the rehabilitation process, we tried what the statute and

13

the regulations provide, and it didn't work.

14

QUESTION:

Can you tell us a little bit --

15

QUESTION:

-- why doesn't the regulation address

16

it, Mr. Roberts?

17

with your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question and the

18

distinction that you were drawing in mine between the way

19

Congress treated alcohol and treated drugs.

20

I mean, I think that's the problem I had

If, in fact, it is so clear that the deterrent

21

effect would be vitiated unless there were a firing and so

22

on, why didn't DOT provide it, and the fact that DOT

23

didn't provide it seems to erect a caution sign in my mind

24

in the face of a court that purports to be able to infer

25

the clear public policy that you rest upon.
20

1

MR. ROBERTS:

The assumption underlying your

2

question is that the regulation somehow occupies the

3

field.

4

of situations that can arise.

5

There's --

6

In other words, they addressed the full universe

QUESTION:

They plainly did not.

Well, I'm not getting into so much a

7

technical kind of preemption as I am a practical kind of

8

psychology.

9

assume it is, why wasn't it clear enough for Congress to

10

If it was as clear as your argument seems to

come out and say so in so many words?

11

MR. ROBERTS:

I would suppose because neither

12

Congress nor the Department ever supposed you'd have an

13

arbitrator who would reinstate someone who failed two

14

tests within 15 months to this type of a position.

15

It's --

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, could you comment on the

17

potential civil liability of the employer?

Are there

18

cases -- let's assume an accident with a person who's

previously tested positive.

20

be liable for punitive damages if he took no steps to

21

terminate the employee.

23

punitive damages.

I take it the employer would

If the arbitrator orders the

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

I don't want to --

Are there any cases on this in the

1

lower courts?

2

MR. ROBERTS:

I'm not aware of any, and I don't

3

want to limit what the company will be arguing in the

4

future, but if you accept the interpretation that the

5

arbitrator's decision is an interpretation of the

6

contract, I don't know how much of a defense that's going

7

to be.

QUESTION:

it for some other concessions by the union and they

thought this one was one they didn't care that much about.

would be.

21
22

I'm sure that's what the argument

QUESTION:

So you know, you can't feel very

sorry for the company if that's what happens to them.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

On the other hand, the contract,

24

like every contract, is subject to the public policy

25

exception.

Now, it is an exception that is applicable
22

1
2

only in the rare case, but those cases do come up.
The union today is arguing that there's no role

3

for the courts here, but in the Jones Dairy Farm case it

4

was a union that was arguing for the public policy

5

exception against the management rule that employees had

6

to report unsanitary conditions only to management.

7

The Solicitor General is arguing against the

8

exception today, but when it was a Federal postal worker

9

that they were trying to fire and an arbitrator ordered

10

him reinstated, then the Solicitor General was saying no,

11

the court should vacate that arbitration award.

12

These situations come up with sufficient

13

regularity, sometimes the shoe is on one foot and

14

sometimes on the other, but the fact of the public policy

15

exception has to be recognized, and the one thing that is

16

clear, it seems, is that the lower court approach, which

17

said this is not illegal, therefore there's no role for

18

the public policy exception, is inconsistent with this

19

Court's decision.

20

The formulation has always been the public

21

policy exception applies to contracts that are illegal or

22

that violate public policy, and with respect --

QUESTION:

What's the criterion of violation of

24

public policy going to be?

I don't want to create a whole

25

tort law of drug-impaired drivers that the lower Federal
23

1

courts are going to have to decide how risky it was to put

2

this driver back on the road, how risky it was to put

3

another driver back on the road.

4

kind of stuff the Federal courts are intended to be

5

dealing with.

MR. ROBERTS:

7

QUESTION:

8

you can give us a clear line.

9

suggest a clear line.

10

No.

This is just not the

There are two --

I want a clear line.

I don't think

In fact, you don't even

You say every case has to be

decided on its own facts.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that's what the Court said

12

in Town of Newton, and I think it's correct.

13

a clear line, but what the Court has said -- and there are

14

two aspects to the question.

15

policy is, how do you tell whether it's violated.

16

There is not

How do you tell what the

On the policy question, what the Court has said

17

is, it has to be well-defined, and you have to point to

18

the laws of legal precedents.

19

definition of this testing program is spelled out in

20

detail by Congress and the Department of Transportation.

21

QUESTION:

That's satisfied here.

The

Well, I don't agree with your

22

expression of what the public policy is, for one thing.

23

You say the public policy is what?

24

who drive dangerous vehicles shouldn't be users of illegal

25

drugs.
24

You said that people

act.

3

is at issue here.

That's the policy of the testing

Congress has said that, and that is the policy that

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but DOT has indicated that at

5

least on the first offense there can be reinstatement, and

6

the regs are silent on the repeat offense, so what do we

7

make of that?

8

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, what the regs say, according

9

to the Solicitor General, and we agree, is that it's left

10

to private ordering, and if it's left to private ordering

11

in the form of a contract, the public policy exception

12

applies.

13

Now, that's as far as we got in the lower

14

courts.

15

look at it because it's not illegal.

16

it may be seen difficult to manage the application here is

17

that the district court hasn't done it, and the court of

18

appeals hasn't done it in this case.

19

Then the lower courts said, we're not going to

QUESTION:

One reason I think

But you agree it wouldn't be illegal,

20

because you -- in answer to my question you said if the

21

employer wants to keep this person on, he could.

22

wouldn't be violating any law or regulation.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

It

That's an important limitation on

24

this, is on the public policy exception, which is that it

25

only applies when the courts are asked to enforce the
25

contract.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

13

Mr. Mooney, we'll hear from you.

The second question presented is, should

15

arbitration awards be vacated on public policy grounds

only when the award itself violates positive law or

requires unlawful conduct by the employer?

your argument, will you tell us your position on that?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. MOONEY

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

21
22
23

MR. MOONEY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We believe that the Court doesn't need to reach

24

the unanswered question in footnote 12 of Misco because

25

the standard that the Court announced in Misco, which was
26

1

basically affirmed in Grace, provides ample analytical

2

framework for this Court and any court to analyze this

3

case.

4

What Misco taught us is that in the 301 context,

5

a court may refuse to enforce an arbitrator's award

6

because it is contrary to public policy if and only if it

7

violates an explicit public policy that is well-defined

8

and dominant, and is ascertained by an examination of laws

9

and legal precedents, and not general supposed notions of

10

public interest.

11

with the public relevant public policy can the arbitration

12

award or contract in the 301 context be struck down.

13

Only if there is an explicit conflict

Eastern challenges under the guise of public

14

policy an arbitration award that was rendered pursuant to

15

the parties' collective bargaining agreement, which

16

reinstated an employee who had tested positive for

17

marijuana.

18

in the omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991

19

and the regulations issued by the Department of

20

Transportation pursuant to that statute.

21

The policy that it uses is the policy embodied

An examination of the statute and the

22

regulations reveals a comprehensive public policy.

It is

23

not merely deterrence.

24

out of driving dangerous vehicles, although we agree it is

25

in there.

It is not merely to take employees

It also has a statutory purpose of
27

1

rehabilitation and a return to duty for these employees.

2

The basic framework of the statute, as we see

3

it, and the regs issued pursuant to that, is detection of

4

these employees, removal from the safety-sensitive

5

position --

6

QUESTION:

It seems to me like saying that when

7

you have a criminal law that provides sending a person who

8

commits a certain crime to prison for only 10 years there

9

are two policies involved, one that he should be punished

10

for doing whatever he did wrong, and secondly that such

11

people should be released after 10 years, and I don't know

12

that that's a public policy.

13

limitation upon the first public policy.

14

I mean, it's just a

I don't know that I would express it to be a

15

policy in and of itself that there should be

16

rehabilitation of people, and that people who have

17

violated proscriptions against the use of illegal drugs

18

and driving dangerous vehicles, we want these people to be

19

rehabilitated.

20

itself.

21

I don't see that as a policy in and of

It's simply a limitation on the other policy.
MR. MOONEY:

I would disagree, Justice Scalia,

22

because the statute specifically refers to rehabilitating

23

these employees, and that was one of the policy goals, so

24

I don't view it as a separate policy.

25

part of the policy embodied in the statute and the
28

We would view it as

1

regulations, and of course there's not just a penal aspect

2

to the regulations that we have here.

send these employees to a substance abuse professional who

4

must evaluate them, develop a plan, and that employee must

5

successfully complete that plan prior to being eligible to

6

return.

7

QUESTION:

What it does is

Let me ask you this.

Do you contest

8

that it is a clearly defined public policy that persons as

9

to whom there is a substantial risk because of prior drug

10

use, that they will be under the influence of drugs when

11

driving dangerous vehicles, should not be behind the

12

wheels of such vehicles?

13

MR. MOONEY:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MOONEY:

16

QUESTION:

Oh, we agree with that -Okay.
-- Justice Scalia.
Now, what if a -- an arbitrator under

17

an arbitration clause such as this said in his award, I

18

really think there is a substantial risk that this person

19

will use drugs again and perhaps drive a vehicle while

20

he's still under the influence of drugs again.

21

Nonetheless, despite that substantial risk, I think we

22

should give him another chance. Would you allow a Federal

23

district court to set aside that arbitration decision?

24

MR. MOONEY:

Your Honor, what we would do is go

25

back to the framework of Misco.
29

We would take the public

1

policy as established.

2

includes the remedy that the arbitrator crafted, and in

3

the balancing of all the circumstances, apparently the

4

arbitrator in your situation still thought it was

5

appropriate to return that employee to duty.

6

QUESTION:

We would take that award, which

He thought so despite the fact that

7

there was a substantial risk that he would endanger the

8

public again by being under the influence of drugs again.

9

He says that explicitly.

I acknowledge there's a

10

substantial risk that this will happen, but I think -- I'm

11

a tender-hearted fellow -- he should be reinstated anyway.

12

MR. MOONEY:

So long as he complies with the

13

statutory and regulatory prerequisites, and so long as

14

that remedy is within the scope of the arbitrator's

15

commission, we believe that that arbitration award should

16

be enforced.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know what there is left

18

of the public policy exception if you allow an arbitrator

19

to essentially disregard it.

20

public policy not to undertake that substantial risk.

21

arbitrator says there is that substantial risk, but you

22

nevertheless say we're going to let the arbitrator under

23

the contract force the employer to put the man back on the

24

road.

25

MR. MOONEY:

You acknowledge it's a

Well, Your Honor, that's what we

The

30

1

would posit would be the appropriate standard.

2

really goes to the second question, which is the

3

unanswered question in Misco, although I doubt an

4

arbitrator would do that, and I am not aware of any

5

circumstance --

6

QUESTION:

That

Well, suppose an arbitrator did do

7

that for a transportation company.

8

guy is going to drive around getting into an accident with

9

earth-moving equipment, but I'm still going to send him

10

back to his job.

11

draw its essence from the contract?

12

He says, I think this

Do you think an award like that would

MR. MOONEY:

If we had the question of whether

13

it draws its essence from the contract we would go under

14

the established guidelines since Enterprise Wheel, and

15

perhaps that would not do that.

16

QUESTION:

All right.

We think the law -So if it would not do

17

that -- I mean, it's an awfully odd award that a

18

transportation company has to hire back somebody who they

19

think is going to get into an accident.

20

MR. MOONEY:

We don't quibble with the

21

jurisprudence that the courts have developed ever since

22

Enterprise Wheel.

23

difficulty in following that, and we recognize that some

24

arbitration awards that have idiosyncratic developments

25

have been struck down, vacated, or a court's refused to

We think the courts have not had great

31

1
2

enforce that.
QUESTION:

Well, is it easier for the courts to

3

say, a) that it's against public policy, or b) that it

4

does not draw its essence from the contract?

5

more precise doctrine?

6

MR. MOONEY:

Which is the

Well, we would view the Misco

7

public policy exception as part of an overall deference to

8

labor arbitration, the 301, that goes back to Lincoln

9

Mills and then comes through the Steelworkers Trilogy, so

10

I don't know if there's -- how you would attempt to

11

analytically put that in a box, Justice Kennedy.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I had thought Justice Breyer's

13

question suggested that there might be another way to

14

answer Justice Scalia's hypothetical by saying, oh, well,

15

this doesn't draw its essence from the contract, and I'm

16

asking you if that's any more precise, any more clear, any

17

more categorically manageable from the standpoint of

18

appellate review than the public policy is.

19

me it might not be.

20

MR. MOONEY:

It seems to

I'm not so sure it would be more

21

clear, but I think it would be -- your reference still

22

goes back to the Misco analysis when someone raises public

23

policy -- when someone is attempting to avoid compliance

24

with their own contract by reason of invocation of the

25

public interest, certainly we have to use the analytical
32

1

framework developed in Misco.

2

framework has worked, for the most part.

3

We believe that that

We think it should be affirmed just as we

4

originally had it in Grace, and we see what happened in

5

Grace is that the Court's explicit recognition of a public

6

policy exception in the 301 context perhaps encouraged

7

courts, invigorated them to look at labor arbitration

8

awards under the public policy exception, and the Court

9

had to come back in Misco and remind all of us what it

10

meant in the Grace decision, and we think that the Misco

11

standard --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MOONEY:

14

QUESTION:

Well --- is still perfectly applicable.
-- let us assume that Justice

15

Breyer's question suggests the possibility that the

16

standard of not drawing the award from the essence of the

17

contract gives the courts more latitude than the public

18

policy argument to set aside arbitrators' awards.

19

you agree with that?

20

MR. MOONEY:

Would

The difficulty I have, Justice

21

Kennedy, is whenever you look at the question of, does it

22

draw its essence from the contract, you must examine the

23

contract.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, isn't another difficulty that

you -- it's -- drawing its essence from the contract is
33

1

very contract-specific, whereas presumably the public

2

policy thing might be more general?

3

MR. MOONEY:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you

4

articulated better than what I was trying to say, is that

5

in a Enterprise Wheel case the first duty the court would

6

look at in an arbitration award would be, what is the

7

labor contract?

8

there strictures on the commission of the arbitrator?

9

That's the first line of inquiry.

10

Is there a just cause provision?

Are

Those really don't come in under the Misco

11

analysis as directly as under the Enterprise Wheel

12

analysis.

13

well-defined, dominant public policy in the laws and legal

14

precedents, and only if that policy is violated by the

15

award can it be struck down in the 301 context.

Misco says that there must be an articulated,

16

QUESTION:

Well, why --

17

QUESTION:

But you do acknowledge that there is

18

a general public policy against having people who use

19

prohibited drugs from driving dangerous vehicles.

20

MR. MOONEY:

Justice O'Connor, we certainly do,

21

and we look to that policy as articulated perhaps best by

22

the policymaker itself in this area, which is the

23

Department of Transportation.

24

told us how that policy is to work in situations like

25

Mr. Smith's.
34

The policymaker itself has

1

QUESTION:

But Mr. Roberts says that that policy

2

is silent as to what should be done to recidivists.

3

do you agree with that or not?

4

MR. MOONEY:

Now,

I part company with Mr. Roberts in

5

analyzing that question.

6

offenders, recidivists, was considered by the agency in

7

its rule-making.

8

would have a sanction for a second offense of a 60-day

9

period outside the safety-sensitive position, or removal

10
11

The question of repeat

Initially there was a proposal that

from work, suspension.
After receiving comments, the agency did not

12

adopt that standard.

13

sanction for failing the rehab program, which is in

14

essence what happened, is the same as in alcohol testing,

15

which is you will be removed, rehabilitated, and eligible

16

for return to service.

17

QUESTION:

What it did do is remind us that the

Return to what service?

That was a

18

question that I asked Mr. Roberts, and I'm not sure what

19

the situation is in this very case.

20

arbitrator's award, is there instruction that after the

21

rehabilitation period this man is to be returned to the

22

job of driver, or consistent with that award could the

23

company give him work in a nonsafety-sensitive position?

24
25

MR. MOONEY:

As you understand the

Your Honor, we would read the award

as stating that Mr. Smith was to return to work on
35

1

October 20 of that year.

2

completed the program, as he had, to return to the

3

safety-sensitive position, we would say he should get that

4

position.

5

reading would be that he return to employment consistent

6

with the other provisions of the collective bargaining

7

agreement.

8
9

If he had satisfactorily

If he has not completed that program, our

QUESTION:

But I think then you're going beyond

the award, but you've been very candid, I think, if I

10

understand what you said, that this award says if he

11

passes the rehabilitation course he goes back in the

12

driver's post.

13

MR. MOONEY:

That's our reading of the award,

14

Justice Ginsburg, is that Mr. Smith, once he satisfies the

15

prerequisites contained in the statute, which is referral

16

to the SAP, completion of that process, successful

17

evaluation by the SAP, and then a return-to-duty test,

18

which he has not taken -- he was ready, willing and able

19

to take it.

20

he should be able to return to his MEO job.

21

Once he satisfies all of those prerequisites,

QUESTION:

I read it that way, too.

That's the

22

only way to understand why he should have to be

23

rehabilitated.

24

job as far as public policy is concerned, right?

25

He can still be a pot-head and do a desk

(Laughter.)
36

1

QUESTION:

Why make him go through the

2

rehabilitation if you're not looking to his driving a rig

3

again?

4

award, but I don't understand how you can think that the

5

Secretary, by not addressing recidivists, is in effect

6

saying recidivism doesn't matter.

7

So I agree with you on the interpretation of the

It seems to me the fact that they didn't apply

8

automatic disqualification for recidivism only means, you

9

know, there are all sorts of circumstances that may exist,

10

and we're not willing to say categorically that somebody

11

can never come back, but that doesn't answer the question,

12

certainly, whether, when you have a person whom -- in my

13

hypothetical, the arbitrator acknowledges that there is

14

significant risk that this person will be under the

15

influence of drugs again behind the wheel.

16

When the arbitrator finds that and nonetheless

17

puts him back behind the wheel, public policy isn't

18

violated.

19

address that situation is anything except silence.

20

I don't think the failure of the regs to

MR. MOONEY:

We would disagree, Justice Scalia.

21

We believe that the agency has not precluded these

22

employees from coming back once they've satisfied the

23

statutory prerequisites, but the hypothetical that you

24

posit would probably be a vehicle for the Court to address

25

the question that it did not reach in Misco, which is
37

MR. MOONEY:

And we're asking you how the Court

We believe, as the union did in

5

Misco, that the appropriate standard in that case, Justice

6

Kennedy, would be that unless the contract or the award

7

giving life to that contract violates positive law, it

8

should be enforced, and we have several reasons for why we

9

view that that is the appropriate standard if the court

10

was to need to reach it.

11

QUESTION:

But you say we shouldn't reach it

because this case doesn't stretch that far, because here

think that that's how easily this case can be resolved.

that labor contracts really are something different than

what they do is lawful, we're not going to interfere with

that.

QUESTION:

Does the arbitrator -- is the

7

arbitrator under an obligation, or, indeed, to your

8

knowledge does the arbitrator as a routine matter take

9

into account public policy?

10

MR. MOONEY:

Your Honor, we believe that

11

arbitrators routinely take into account those

12

considerations, the examination of external law.

13

submission to the Court as amicus on our behalf, this is

the sort of thing that numerous arbitrators do and,

17

As the

18

commission he can and should look at those other

19

considerations.

20

is they have the specialized judgment, as the Court

21

recognized in Gateway Coal, to resolve those questions.

22

Certainly an arbitrator can look at those external sources

23

and use the benefit of those to craft a remedy.

24
25

That's why people select the arbitrators,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

21

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

22

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

23
24
25

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The arbitrator in this case treated the
41

1

employee's drug use as a serious offense.

2

it worthy of serious punishment.

3

aspects of the arbitrator's decision, the petitioner

4

really has no complaint.

5

He considered

With respect to those

Petitioner contends that the arbitrator's award

6

is contrary to public policy only in that the arbitrator

7

chose to impose a suspension of slightly over 3 months

8

plus costs of the arbitration in lieu of outright

9

discharge, and therefore the question is whether the

10

punishment imposed by the arbitrator can reliably be said

11

to conflict with public policy.

12

This Court emphasized in Misco that a court

13

asked to vacate an arbitral award in the labor context on

14

the basis of public policy must draw that policy from

15

positive law, from statutes and regulations.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, what's the Government's

position on question 2 that's presented?
MR. STEWART:

We would say that there are

19

limited circumstances under which an arbitral award can be

20

vacated even though the award would not compel the

21

employer to violate positive law, and to give you a

22

hypothetical example, the Department of Transportation has

23

a regulation that says that a driver who is convicted of

24

driving under the influence is disqualified from operating

25

a commercial motor vehicle for a period of 1 year.
42

1

Now, in a hypothetical case in which an employee

2

was believed to have driven under the influence, was not

3

convicted, but conceded at the arbitral proceeding that he

4

had, in fact, driven while under the influence of alcohol

5

and drugs, in such a case, if the arbitrator imposed a

6

3-month suspension and then put the person back behind the

7

wheel, that would not literally compel the employer to

8

violate positive law because there would be no conviction.

9

But given that there was an alternative basis

10

for feeling highly confident that the prohibited conduct

11

had occurred, such an award would be explicable only on

12

the ground that the arbitrator disagreed with the policy

13

judgment reflected in the DOT regulations.

14

But we do -- while we don't think that the

15

vacatur of the award is limited to those situations in

16

which a violation of positive law would otherwise occur,

17

we do think that the relevant public policy must be drawn

18

directly from positive law, and therefore the question is,

19

is there anything in the testing act or the DOT

20

regulations that identifies discharge as the mandatory

21

penalty for a second drug offense or not, and in our view

22

there's no way that the regulations or the statute can

23

fairly be read to compel that conclusion.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, they can't compel that

conclusion, but wouldn't you say it's part of the public
43

1

policy, a clear part of the public policy, that a -- that

2

where there is a substantial possibility that a person who

3

has been a drug user will be under the influence of drugs

4

while driving, that person should not be put behind the

5

wheel?

6

MR. STEWART:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STEWART:

9

I think that's correct --

All right.
-- and I think the DOT reg -- but

I think the DOT regulations --

10

QUESTION:

So you would acknowledge that if the

11

arbitrator's finding in this case could be characterized

12

as ignoring that substantial possibility, it could be set

13

aside?

14

MR. STEWART:

We wouldn't say that, because in

15

our view the DOT regulations provide an alternative basis

16

for preventing that, that feared result from occurring.

17

That is, regardless of whether the arbitrator orders this

18

person reinstated, the person is not eligible under the

19

regulations to drive a commercial vehicle until he

20

complies with DOT's rehabilitation requirements.

21

And if he's evaluated by the substance abuse

22

professional, if the substance abuse professional

23

certifies that he has complied with the recommended course

24

of treatment and that the employer is therefore legally

25

free to employ him again in driving a truck, that provides
44

1

the basis for assurance that a person who poses a

2

substantial risk will not be on the roads, and --

3
4

QUESTION:

Who are these substance abuse

professionals who have the unfortunate acronym SAP's?

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

7

Do you get a certificate as a SAP, or

what --

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. STEWART:

The SAP's, as we refer to them,

10

are not -- they're not certified by the Department of

11

Transportation, but the regulations do specify the

12

categories of people who are eligible to perform this

13

service, and the regulations also make clear that the

14

choice of a particular SAP is up to the employer unless

15

the employer has delegated that power away through

16

collective bargaining agreement, so the employer has the

17

ultimate power to ensure that this important decision is

18

not being entrusted to someone, somebody that the employer

19

believes is insufficiently protective of the public

20

safety.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, do you think that there

22

is a difference and that public policy overrides, say,

23

something that would just come under the FAA, a question

24

the Chief asked, say a consumer contract that's drawn by

25

the seller, and that's dictated the contract, and a -45

1

adding on top of the collective bargaining contract public

2

policy in the case of a -- of an employer-union negotiated

3

contract?

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, we would certainly agree

5

with the Chief Justice that there is also a strong policy

6

reflected in the language of the Federal Arbitration Act

7

in favor of enforcement of arbitration agreements in the

8

commercial context.

9

There is in the labor context the additional

10

consideration of preserving industrial peace, but we

11

don't -- I don't know that we would say that the two are

12

different in kind.

13

Now, certainly in the State system it is up to a

14

State government to determine how it wants to allocate

15

power among the branches, and therefore State courts may

16

assume far greater authority to devise public policy to

17

set aside contracts that violate it even if they aren't

18

drawing the relevant public policy from positive law.

19

That's up to the State system.

20

But within the Federal system I think even

21

whether within the FAA, or under the labor management

22

statutes,

23

enforcement of contractual choices.

24
25

there is a strong policy in favor of

And so in 1992 to 1994 the Department of
Transportation conducted an extensive rule-making, it
46

1

heard comments from a number of interested people, and its

2

mandate from Congress was to consider both the need to

3

protect the public safety against the ill effects of

4

transportation employees who use drugs, and the testing

5

act also included a congressional finding that

6

rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing

7

program.

8

And it was the Department's mandate to balance

9

those potentially competing objectives, and specifically

10

with respect to the problem of a recidivist drug user, the

11

initial regulation proposed by the Department of

12

Transportation would have mandated a 60-day

13

disqualification period.

14

And I think, as Justice Breyer suggested, part

15

of the irony of this case is that if that provision had

16

been adopted, we think the petitioner would have no basis

17

for challenging the arbitral award here, because if DOT

18

had said, suspension of at least 60 days, and the

19

arbitrator had imposed a suspension of a little over 3

20

months --

21

QUESTION:

May I ask this question, following up

22

on some of Justice Scalia's?

23

public policy that would require arbitrators in cases such

24

as this to assess the likelihood of recidivism in the

25

future?

Do you think there's a

47

1

MR. STEWART:

I think it all depends on what

2

powers the parties elect to confer upon the arbitrator.

3

That is, if the collective bargaining agreement specified

4

that the punishment for a first positive drug test will be

5

a 30-day suspension followed by reinstatement if the

6

individual has complied with the DOT regulations, I think

7

there would be no room under the contract for the

8

arbitrator to say, I'm not sufficiently confident that

9

this person can do the job again, and therefore I'm

10

ordering him discharged.

11

And conversely, if the collective bargaining

12

agreement said, anybody who violates the drug policy twice

13

will be dismissed, the arbitrator wouldn't have authority

14

to determine that really the policy in favor of

15

rehabilitation was more important and therefore he should

16

be given another chance.

17

But where, as here, we have a collective

18

bargaining agreement that gives the arbitrator very broad

19

discretion to decide whether there is just cause in a

20

particular case, we think the arbitrator would naturally

21

look to public policy considerations, among others.

22

QUESTION:

So you would say he would sometimes

23

make the public policy determination, but not necessarily

24

always.

25

MR. STEWART:

And it would depend upon the
48

1

authority entrusted to him --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. STEWART:

4

And so the Department of Transportation

5

considered a provision that would have imposed a mandatory

6

60-day suspension for recidivists.

7

that if that provision had been adopted, the 90-day-plus

8

suspension that was imposed here couldn't be said to

9

violate public policy, and although it's not terribly

Under the agreements --- by the parties.

It seemed clear to us

10

clear from the Federal Register notice exactly why the

11

Department declined to adopt that provision, it's very

12

clear that the Department understood that the consequence

13

of deleting that proposed rule was to leave to the

14

contracting parties the determination whether

15

reinstatement would occur even after a second positive

16

test.

17

Department of Transportation.

That is the public policy as determined by the

QUESTION:

20

Does the record tell us where

Mr. Smith is working today, and at what job?

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I have

just three very brief points.

5

First, the lower courts did not address the

6

questions we have been discussing this morning.

They

7

adopted the position that because this award was not

8

illegal, the public policy exception does not apply.

9

understand the Solicitor General's representative to agree

10

with us that that is an incorrect statement of the

11

standard.

12

to vacate the decision and send it back for the lower

13

courts to at least apply the correct standard.

14

I

At the very least, then, it seems appropriate

Second, take no comfort in the certification of

15

the substance abuse professional.

My brother for the

16

union said that he certifies that the employee

17

successfully completed rehabilitation.

18

correct.

19

certifies is that the employee properly followed the

20

program, not that it worked, not that it was likely to

21

work, and certainly not that the employee does not present

22

a risk to the public, and also keep in mind that the

23

professional obligation of the SAP is to the employee, not

24

to the public safety.

best for this employee to be back on the job, even if that

Finally, you can look through the regulations in

excruciating detail.

5

may have considered some things.

6

It seems an awful lot of weight to place on the failure to

these rules 20 times is to be treated exactly like someone

9

who violates it one time.

10

It didn't adopt them.

That is insufficient to protect

public safety.
What the regulations provide is that this issue,

reinstatement, is left to contract.

14

If it is left to

In the reported cases alone, you will find

15

examples of arbitrators ordering the reinstatement of

16

nurses who prescribed the wrong medication and stood by

while patients were dying, the helmsman of a 635-foot oil

18

tanker who was on marijuana and ran it aground, the

nuclear plant operator who diffused the safety system at

the plant so he could leave early for lunch, and the pilot

21

of a 727 who flew it while blind drunk.

The public policy exception is needed for those

23

types of cases, and we respectfully submit that the case

of a driver of a 25-ton vehicle in West Virginia who has
