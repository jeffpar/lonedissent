ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REYNOLDS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
The Court today considers what is the proper

12

standard of review for appellate courts when faced with a

13

constitutional challenge to a punitive damage award as

14

grossly excessive.

15

In the instant case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a

16

punitive damage award against Cooper Industries of 4.5

17

million, which 90 times the $50,000 compensatory award.

18

It did so using an abuse of discretion review standard.

19

We submit that that was error, that the court of appeals

20

should have examined the constitutional excessiveness

21

issue independently under a de novo review standard.

22

This Court framed the gross excessiveness

23

constitutional inquiry as it applies to punitive damages

24

in BMW v. Gore.

25

making what is essentially a comparative analysis, looking

It identified there three guideposts for

1

at the reprehensibility of the offense, the ratio, or

2

relationship of the punitive damages to the compensatory

3

award, in order to discern whether the punishment or any

4

discernible relationship to the offense or was wildly

5

disproportional, and as a third guidepost to look at other

6

available sanctions, whether criminal or civil, that would

7

bear on the question of how society generally punishes

8

this sort of offense.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, when you have a

10

standard, what should I say, so wildly extreme, as wildly

11

disproportionate, does it make any difference -- does it

12

really -- do you really think it makes any difference

13

whether you're reviewing the lower court for a -- de novo,

14

or for abuse of discretion?

15

I mean, the question is whether the court abused

16

its discretion in not considering this wildly

17

disproportionate.

18

difference for -- between whether it is wildly

19

disproportionate -- I just find it hard to imagine a

20

situation in which I would be reviewing a district judge

21

for abuse of discretion, and would find that it is -- that

22

it is an abuse of discretion, where I wouldn't also find

23

that it was wildly disproportionate.

24
25

Does that really boil down to any

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

you certainly could come to the same conclusion under both

standards, but the -QUESTION:

Well, the point is, wouldn't you

3

almost -- wouldn't you virtually always come to the same

4

conclusion under both standards?

5

MR. REYNOLDS:

I don't know that you would, and

6

I think that the reason de novo review is important is

7

that you have a legal issue here.

8

implicates a constitutional right.

9

admittedly, bottomed on guideposts that are fluid

You have one that
It is, I think

10

concepts, and there's a need to have some kind of a

11

coherent doctrine that develops so as to have a uniform

12

application of the substantive standards.

13

QUESTION:

Well, do you have much doubt, Mr.

14

Reynolds, that if the standard is de novo review, there

15

will be more determinations of lower -- of the district

16

court, trial court upset than if there's abuse of

17

discretion review?

18

MR. REYNOLDS:

I believe there probably would be

19

more awards that would be upset, or there would be more

20

remittitur decisions.

21

QUESTION:

More law would develop in the courts

22

of appeals, presumably.

23

MR. REYNOLDS:

That's exactly the point I was

24

trying to make, that I do think that you would get a more

25

coherent body of law.

You would be able to better

1

determine how to apply the standard, and it would be

2

applied in a way that would be more uniform, and I think

3

one of the objectives of the due process protection is

4

that people who are similarly situated be treated the same

5

way for --

8

QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, is this a mixed

question of fact and law that we're talking about?
MR. REYNOLDS:

Justice O'Connor, I think that it

9

could be characterized as a mixed question of fact and law

10

in that, as I understand what that means, it means that if

11

you have established facts, and you're applying a legal

12

principle to those facts, that would be a mixed question

13

of fact and law.

14

QUESTION:

For instance, in the first prong, the

15

reprehensible conduct, presumably a review of the facts is

16

included in the appellate review, so you do seem to have a

17

mixed standard --

18

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, to some --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. REYNOLDS:

21

To some extent I think I would agree with you.

22

It does seem to me that what we're talking about here in

23

de novo review is the same thing that the Court does

24

traditionally.

25

deferential review, and we don't suggest there would be

Excuse me, Your Honor.

As to historical facts, the Court accords

1

any difference as to that.

2

But when you get to the legal issue of where you

3

cross the constitutional line, and you start looking at it

4

in a comparative analysis, which really is looking at

5

extrinsic facts that are outside the record, that's where

6

the legal inquiry comes in and de novo review would be

7

required.

8
9

QUESTION:

On the reprehensibility of the

conduct, do you envisage that if you prevail the circuit

10

court will have some sort of standards for

11

reprehensibility, or how will it go about writing this?

12

MR. REYNOLDS:

13

QUESTION:

Well --

I could see if it was abuse of

14

discretion, I can hear the circuit court saying, well,

15

trial judges see the witness, and they heard the whole

16

trial, and they're in the position to make this judgment,

17

and we're not going to second-guess them.

18

would happen under the abuse of discretion standard in all

19

likelihood.

20
21

What would the circuit court do with this first
prong that Justice O'Connor mentioned, reprehensibility?

22

MR. REYNOLDS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. REYNOLDS:

25

That's what

I --

Under your view?
As I understand it, Your Honor,

the court of appeals would basically take the conduct and,

1

on the established record, that would be the baseline, if

2

you will, for its comparative analysis under the Gore

3

factors.

4

fits on a continuum of blameworthiness, if you will, and

5

that would be essentially a legal question.

You would have to look at where that conduct

6

What you're doing is very much, it seems to me,

7

Your Honor, what you do under the de novo review standard

8

that this Court announced in Bajakajian, I believe is how

9

you pronounce it.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, may I interrupt you at

11

that point, because what you described sounded very much

12

to me like what a jury does when it's choosing among

13

negligence degrees of culpability, negligence, gross

14

negligence, recklessness.

15

decisions, and they're not reviewed de novo by any judge,

16

not the trial judge, not the court of appeals, so why

17

isn't the degree of reprehensibility exactly the same?

18

MR. REYNOLDS:

Those are quintessentially jury

Well, Your Honor, here the -- we

19

are over a threshold of malice that is necessary in order

20

to award a punitive award.

21

QUESTION:

Just like you would be over a

22

threshold if you decide there's negligence.

23

there's negligence, then there would be recovery, but

24

there might be greater recovery if you had a higher

25

standard.

Then, if

1

MR. REYNOLDS:

Right,

but I think what the

2

Court has said in BMW v. Gore is that you are going to

3

determine whether or not the punishment that is imposed

4

here is reasonably related to the crime, and whether it

5

rationally serves the interest of punishment and

6

deterrence, and that is an analysis, a legal analysis that

7

looks to this conduct as compared to similar conduct and

8

the way in which that has been treated in the punishment

9

arena, and in other situations.

10

QUESTION:

Could you describe the precise test

11

that the court of appeals would be applying under your

12

standard as compared with the precise test that would

13

apply under an arbitrary and capricious standard?

14

It seems to me the substantive question, which

15

they would apply on de novo, is whether any reasonable

16

person could possibly consider this proportionate.

17

that the test?

18

assume that means no reasonable person could consider it

19

proportionate, right?

It has to be wildly disproportionate.

20

MR. REYNOLDS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. REYNOLDS:

25

Isn't

I think that that would --

Okay.
I don't quarrel with that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Now, if you're using an abuse of

discretion standard, you would be asking whether any

1

reasonable judge, whether no reasonable judge could think

2

that any reasonable person would consider this

3

proportionate.

4

boil down to the same thing?

You're sure that the two questions don't

5

MR. REYNOLDS:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

Well, Your Honor, I --

I -- it's just too subtle for me to

understand the difference between the two.
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think that there is a

substantive standard that has been announced as being

10

applicable in BMW v. Gore, and we're not going back and

11

suggesting we revisit that.

12

ought to get meaningful application, it ought to be

13

applied so as to allow the courts to give some content to

14

it and through cases to come to a more clear understanding

15

of exactly how it applies in different cases.

16

What we're saying is that it

It is, I believe, clear, and I agree with the

17

Chief Justice, that the de novo standard would allow

18

courts of appeals, who believe that this was

19

disproportionate punishment, it would allow them to apply

20

a remittitur when, under the abuse of discretion standard,

21

they would feel that they were not compelled to.

22

QUESTION:

I understand that, but it seems to me

23

that whenever a court of appeals finds that no reasonable

24

person could possibly consider this proportionate, so it

25

is wildly disproportionate, it would automatically find

1

that no reasonable judge could have thought that a

2

reasonable person would find this proportionate.

3

know whether you can find one finding --

4
5

MR. REYNOLDS:

QUESTION:

-- without automatically making the

other one, so what are we arguing about?

8
9

Yes, Your Honor. I don't

disagree --

6
7

I don't

MR. REYNOLDS:

I don't disagree that where you

have a punitive award that is so over the line that

10

everybody agrees that it would be unconstitutional, that

11

whichever standard you apply would probably give you the

12

same result.

13

you're not talking about something that is so over the

14

line.

15

You're going to have a lot of cases where

I happen to believe this case is one that is so

16

over the line, and the point is that you've got a legal

17

question, it's got a constitutional dimension, you've got

18

a standard that is not one that is dependent upon looking

19

at the historical facts and second-guessing them, and

20

that, I believe, dictates that you look for de novo review

21

and independent review by the courts of appeals.

22

QUESTION:

Whatever word you use to describe it,

23

I take it that what you're essentially asking is to have

24

the judge, as a panel of three judges, sit as though they

25

were jurors, as though they were jurors making a
11

1

determination of reprehensibility.

2

MR. REYNOLDS:

As though they were jurors in

3

making the policy judgment as to what the appropriate

4

punishment is in order to fulfill the goals of deterrence

5

and retribution.

6

QUESTION:

And then if we go back in history,

7

punitive damages, I believe, was considered in the

8

bailiwick of the jury, and not the judge.

9

was a question whether any judge, even the trial judge,

10

In fact, there

could overturn the jury's verdict, is that not so?

11

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, I believe it's clear that

12

you could have a court overturn a verdict if, indeed, it

13

was a verdict that was outrageously excessive, or, as they

14

said in the early cases, driven by juror bias or passion,

15

and was not proportional to the offense, and I believe the

16

common law, as well as the early American law, has said

17

that punitive damages would certainly be reviewable in

18

that regard, as would compensatory, so I think --

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds --

20

MR. REYNOLDS:

21

QUESTION:

-- appellate review is available.

I'm not certain of that, and I think

22

that, at least as to compensatory damages, there was some

23

disagreement on this Court whether there was any allowance

24

of --

Right.

MR. REYNOLDS:

Justice

you said that there was appellate review.
QUESTION:

Would you argue, Mr. Reynolds,

8

different principles to -- and different propositions to

the circuit court than you would to the jury, or do you

10
11

just argue the same thing?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think that the -- well, the

12

arguments to the jury in this regard would depend in large

13

part on the instructions that were given to the jury, and

14

I think there are some instructions that would be very

15

problematic to give the jury in terms of the BMW v. Gore

guideposts, so --

1

excesses of the jury determination with regard to

2

punishment, and it is a test, as I understand BMW v. Gore,

3

that says that we're going to look at what the jury did in

4

this case in order to serve society's interest in

5

punishment and deterrence, and to see whether that is out

6

of line, constitutionally out of line, with the punishment

that is visited for similarly-situated people who commit

similar offenses.

QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds --

MR. REYNOLDS:

It is a check, if you will, at

the appellate level on the jury judgment call.
QUESTION:

So if that's true, then Justice

13

Scalia's proposition that no reasonable juror could find

14

the award doesn't quite work, because you're putting forth

15

different contentions to the two different bodies.

16

You're putting one case to the court of appeals, and

another to the jury, i.e. --

18

MR. REYNOLDS:

19

QUESTION:

I --

-- that this is inconsistent with

20

what other juries and judges have done around the country

21

and therefore just doesn't meet the standard of

proportionality under some Nation-wide proportionality

standard that the jury didn't hear about, or is the answer

24

that the jury can hear about this stuff?

into the picture until a district judge, the trial judge,

12

so it would be de novo review not of the jury's

13

assessment, but of the trial judge's refusal to tamper

14

with the jury's verdict, so isn't it -- the court of

15

appeals is reviewing not the jury's action but the trial

16

court's action, isn't that so?

17

The court of appeals doesn't get

MR. REYNOLDS:

That's correct, and I think that

as we were saying, Justice Ginsburg, the court of appeals

19

would, in that instance, do the traditional deferential

20

review of the historical facts, or the fact questions, but

21

as to this legal question it would be a de novo review.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, let me ask you if I am

23

understanding your argument correctly in this respect.

24

think you're making two different kinds of arguments for

25

the value of the de novo review.

I

1

The first argument is simply that de novo review

2

on its own merits is the better review here.

3

argument is sort of a practical one, that if all you have

4

is abuse of discretion review of what the trial judge does

5

when the trial judge reviews the jury verdict, you're not

6

going to have very many appellate cases, and you're

7

certainly not going to have many appellate cases with

8

exhaustive discussions of the way jury verdicts ought to

9

be examined.

10

The second

And I think you're saying that if you have de

11

novo review, you're simply going to have more

12

articulations by appellate courts of the way trial courts

13

ought to look at jury verdicts, and if you are making the

14

second argument, I suppose you're making -- you're saying

15

what ought to happen in the development of the review of

16

punitive damages is the same thing that I think happened

17

back in the old days on the review of jury verdicts of

18

negligence.

19

If you go back in the law reports to the

20

twenties and the thirties when negligence law was

21

developing, you find exhaustive appellate discussions of

22

whether, you know, the train was close enough to the

23

intersection for the driver to have been negligent in

24

going out on the track, and so on, and I think you're

25

arguing for a sort of parallel between punitive damages

Which way -- what are you suggesting?

7

MR. REYNOLDS:

I know you're not going to like

8

this answer, because I think that what I would say is, the

9

court of appeals probably could take either approach.

10

If the court of appeals viewed the award as

11

constitutionally excessive, there is authority that

12

suggests that the court of appeals could set what would be

13

the maximum allowable award constitutionally, on its own.

14

I think there is also the ability of the court

15

of appeals to do a remand, and to have the district court

16

perform that, so I'm not sure that --

MR. REYNOLDS:

It would make a lot

I believe the kind of opinion

6

you're likely to get is what we got in this case, where

7

the Ninth Circuit simply says they do not believe that the

district court abused discretion, and it would not provide

any enlightenment, or any kind of coherent -- doctrinal

10

coherence to the BMW v. Gore factors in an application of

that.

12

QUESTION:

So what you want is not -- I mean, I

can't -- I'm having trouble seeing what the difference is

between the standards.

answer seems to be, it depends on what's at issue in the

are certain things, reprehensibility or harm, you'd say,

2

look, judge, remember, the district court judge saw this

3

and you didn't, and take that into account.

4

Now, when you get into the comparison of other

penalties, as to that, I don't see why the district judge

would be in a superior position at all.

7

be in a superior position to decide how reprehensible this

8

person's behavior was, and how harmful it was to this

plaintiff, but then once we get the outer limits of that,

10

the appellate judge on his own applies the constitutional

standard as an element of deference, and there's a big

12

element of no deference.

that, and then beyond that, the words de novo and abuse of

MR. REYNOLDS:

I mean, it's like be a judge.

I think that what you would be

looking at is the kind of standard that you imposed, that

10

was imposed in the, I go back to the Bajakajian -- I

cannot pronounce that -- Bajakajian case, where the Court

12

had the excessiveness issue in the context of a fine and

13

the Eighth Amendment and said de novo review was the

14

appropriate review to determine disproportionality, and

15

went through a not dissimilar kind of an inquiry that BMW

16

v. Gore laid out.

17

And I believe that the de novo standard would

require the kind of demanding or exacting review of those

guideposts in a way that would be much more rigid and

decipherable, if you will, and understandable, than if you

QUESTION:

Isn't it always an abuse of

MR. REYNOLDS:

I think when the trial court

7

makes an error of law, that it would certainly be an abuse

8

of discretion, but I also would say that I think the

9

standard we use here is one that is compelled by the

10

nature of the inquiry and the fact that it's

11

constitutional, and by the Gore guideposts, and the

12

comparative analysis which are extrinsic to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22
23

MR. MASSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We urge an abuse of discretion standard for two

24

principal reasons.

First, there's the historical

25

tradition under which punitive damages were largely

1

committed to the jury with quite limited appellate review,

2

the second reason is the pragmatic argument for abuse of

3

discretion standard.

4

Kennedy have recognized, the Gore guideposts are intensely

5

fact-specific, reprehensibility perhaps most of all and,

6

as this Court noted in Gore, reprehensibility is perhaps

7

the most important indicator of the reasonableness of an

8

award.

As Justice O'Connor and Justice

Also --

10

QUESTION:

What do we do generally, if you look

11

at our precedents, on mixed questions of fact and law on

12

appellate review?

13
14
15

You see some statements that it's de novo
review.

What's the closest analogy, do you suppose?
MR. MASSEY:

Well, we believe that

16

reasonableness is maybe a close analogy, because the

17

touchstone of excessiveness is, of course, reasonableness,

18

and it is the sort of grossly excessive standard that

19

Justice Scalia has referred to, and in many contexts

20

reasonableness --

21

QUESTION:

Well, but there is more than one

22

question under the Gore standard, in addition to

23

reprehensibility, the ratio between compensatory and

24

punitive damages awarded, and how the award compares to

25

other sanctions available for comparable misconduct.

1

Those latter two seem closer to pure questions of law, in

2

a sense.

3

think, on appellate review standard for mixed questions of

4

fact and law?

5

What has this Court historically done, do you

MR. MASSEY:

Well, it's done both, Your Honor.

6

I mean, Pullman standard against Swint is a case noting

7

the difficulty of precise categorizations, but in the

8

context of reasonableness, Cooter and Gell, for example,

9

the reasonableness of Rule 11, the Pierce v. Underwood,

10

the reasonableness of a -- of the legal position taken by

11

the Government in equal-access-to-justice cases.

12

Cooter and Gell is notable because it discussed

13

how negligence has been traditionally reviewed very

14

deferentially under an -- essentially an abuse of

15

discretion standard, so I think Justice Souter's concern

16

about the development of the law can be fully addressed

17

through an abuse of discretion standard, and that --

18

QUESTION:

I couldn't find any except the

19

ones -- I just had to look this up for another reason, and

20

Justice Ginsburg has a couple in an opinion she wrote, but

21

the case -- I mean, this seems not a question of mixed

22

fact and law, but up to a certain point you decide what

23

the facts are.

24

a question of applying the legal label, and so the real

25

question is, under what circumstances does a court of

facts.

Now, until we get to the point of dispute, I'll

give you all the discretion you want, but once we're in

I couldn't find any other than that.
Well, it's -- yes.

We agree that

17

the very last step of the analysis has a strongly legal

18

flavor to it,

19

but --

QUESTION:

Strongly legal -- it isn't a question

20

of degree.

It is a question of black and white.

The

21

question of applying a legal label to a set of undisputed

22

facts is a question of law.

23

Now, you can give as much weight as you want to

25

At that point, we reach the area where there's none.

all we're doing is applying the legal label.

5

had in her opinion?

6

MR. MASSEY:

Now,

Now, on that

There's Gasperini, Your Honor,

7

which involved a New York statute which did not simply

8

direct district courts to review the historical facts

9

underlying a compensatory award, but instructed them to

10

engage in a comparative analysis, an essentially legal

11

analysis of this compensatory award versus other

12

compensatory awards in New York to see if they were

13

comparable.

14

QUESTION:

In fact, they gave that instruction

15

to the appellate courts, and this Court said, because of

16

the Seventh Amendment, that job -- the only judge

17

positioned to do it in the Federal courts would be the

18

district courts.

MR. MASSEY:

Exactly, Your Honor, and that was

20

essentially a legal inquiry, but this Court said the court

21

of appeals was constrained --

22

QUESTION:

Oh, but then that's exactly the

question, because I'd say, I don't see any reason why,

reason that a court of appeals here should defer one

little bit, any more than it does with any other standard

2

of law, except with a very few exceptions.

3

MR. MASSEY:

Well, as Justice Scalia noted, the

4

question of whether a mistake of law has been made is an

5

automatic abuse of discretion, if there hasn't been a

6

mistake, so traditionally this label of abuse of

7

discretion has been used, even though before Gore, even

8

under State law excessiveness standards, there was always

9

the last step of applying the law to the facts in the

10
11

court of appeals.
In other words, consider a State which has

12

codified standards for excessiveness of damages, as some

13

States have, like Texas, for example.

14

district judge has no discretion whether to apply those

15

statutory criteria.

16

in Judge Friendly's terms.

17

the last step, yet the standard of review has always been

18

abuse of discretion.

2

MR. MASSEY:

Yes, Your Honor, you did.

We

3

believe that case is not controlling, because first there

4

were separate interests there, a need for a national

5

standards of law enforcement, and other reasons that the

6

Court noted.

7

In particular --

QUESTION:

Well, but if BMW v. Gore announces a

8

constitutional rule, presumably there's a need for

9

national standards there, just as surely as with the

10

Fourth Amendment.

11

MR. MASSEY:

Well, Your Honor, we think, though,

12

that a district court review would be the best way to

13

promote uniformity in the context of punitive damages,

14

because --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, though, you could have said the

same thing about Ornelas.
MR. MASSEY:

law enforcement officials on the questions underlying the

20

judgments of reasonable suspicion --

QUESTION:

MR. MASSEY:

As a part of de novo review.
Yes, Your Honor.

You're correct

about Ornelas.

wrote it.

5

MR. MASSEY:

(Laughter.)

7

MR. MASSEY:

No, I understand.

I understand, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

8

understand, but the Robinette case is a case where you

9

noted that the fact-specific nature of reasonableness made

10

bright line rules inappropriate, and you recognized the

11

need to defer to the sort of close people who were closer

12

on the facts and on the scene.

13

But let me just circle back for a moment,

14

because the Rule 59 context, and motions for remittiturs,

15

those have always been judged by an abuse of discretion

16

standard, and that, of course, is where constitutional

17

excessiveness challenges are ordinarily raised.

18

quite a logic to the Cooter and Gell position that we

19

ought to have a unitary standard of review in this area

20

because the Rule 59 context, as Justice Breyer mentioned,

21

will require the district judge to apply sometimes the

22

very same standards as are in Gore to the judgment under

23

State law requirements.

Well, the difference with 59, I

thought, look, BMW is -- governs quite extreme cases, you

10

know, and if you say, look, judge, you have a lot of

11

discretion under 59, and you have a lot of discretion to

12

decide how egregious something is, and you have

13

reprehensibility, and how much harm, and all those things.

14

Now you give him discretion on discretion, then

15

you say at this last step, where you're also applying this

legal label that only applies to extreme cases, you're

saying, and now there's some more discretion even in that,

judges have done in reviewing, or are they studies about

7

what appellate courts have done in reviewing trial judges?

8

MR. MASSEY:

Both, Your Honor.

Both.

In -- the

total of both trial and appellate together is -- the range

10

of reversal goes from 54 to 70 percent.

11

look just at appellate courts applying abuse of

12

discretion, I believe there are numerous cases in the

13

General Dynamics brief.

14

If you want to

Particularly, there's a case called Kim, one

15

called Kimzey, there's an Aetna Life case from the Ninth

16

Circuit, so I don't believe -- the abuse of discretion

17

standard is not a toothless standard.

18

in U.S. v. Taylor, which was a 1980 Speedy Trial Act case

19

which reversed the dismissal of a case under the Speedy

20

Trial Act, this Court described abuse of discretion as

21

permitting thorough appellate review, so we don't share

22

the view --

23

QUESTION:

As this Court noted

Well, but it's thorough appellate

24

review -- you say it's not a toothless standard, but I

25

1

and a lot is going to get through, and sure, there are

2

some teeth, but -- I mean, I -- it seems to me that your

3

brother's argument is -- does not depend, perhaps, on

4

exact parsing of the difference between applying de novo

5

and abuse so much as it does in emphasizing that if you're

6

going to have de novo review it's going to be a more

7

aggressive review, and it's going to be a more articulate

8

review, and doesn't he make sensible points in that

9

respect?

10

MR. MASSEY:

Well, perhaps superficially, but I

11

really -- but we believe that, for example, the practical

12

result of telling courts of appeals that they have to

13

review de novo long, burdensome records might be actually

14

to reduce the amount of time they have --

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but I mean, you've just been

16

telling us that they're going to review carefully on abuse

17

of discretion, and I suppose they're going to have to look

18

at long, burdensome records there, aren't they?

19

MR. MASSEY:

Well, we believe that in a case

20

involving -- the headline cases we see in the papers about

21

big, punitive awards can be addressed fully by an abuse of

22

discretion standard.

23

What's going to happen in the run-of-the-mill

24

cases, where the result is actually reasonable and falls

25

within what this Court described in Gore as the zone of

1

reasonableness, those cases are going to occupy a

2

tremendous amount of appellate resources without many

3

differences in result, and the result of the whole process

4

may be more unpublished opinions in punitive damages cases

5

because the courts of appeals are busy reading records in

6

cases where the abuse of discretion standard would have

7

the same outcome.

8
9

So we -- as a practical matter, Rule 59 is a
familiar standard.

The abuse of discretion review has

10

grown up, not just under Gore, but under the State law

11

excessiveness standards which courts have always applied

12

historically, even though the last step of applying any of

13

these standards could be described as a purely legal

14

issue.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- Mr. Massey, the point

16

that I'm having difficulty with, and I think Justice

17

O'Connor raised it first, there's one of these standards,

reprehensibility, degree of reprehensibility that sounds

like even at the last step.

21

recklessness.

It's a judgment call that the

I don't really see the difference.

22

But the other two standards, the seriousness of

23

the injury and the comparable awards in other cases, that

24

the jury isn't so well-equipped to deal with, and you can

25

say this is law applied to historic facts.

For example, the Cooper brief in this very case,

the reply brief, leads off with three pages of factual

factual disagreement about how to apply this.

you're going to have to do that anyway in any appeal, and

so -- but you read it with an eye favorably towards the

you can't read it that favorably, but that's going to be

true no matter what standard you have.

They're always arguing about that sort of stuff,

Isn't the difference between the Rule

this:

Rule 59 motions are reviewing, sort of, or are

intended to review what are claimed to be specific

mistakes and problems in individual cases, but what we're

14

dealing with here is regarded somehow as a more serious

15

and a more intractable problem than what Rule 59

16

addresses, and therefore the argument is, because you have

a more intractable problem in trying to get some kind of

coherent standard for punitive damages, you've simply got

19

to have a more restrictive remedy or a more intensive

review, so Rule 59 really is not a good precedent to

2

the problem of remittitur issues as being a problem

3

comparable to the difficulty of trying to get some kind of

4

a coherent standard for punitive damages, and because the

5

problems are different maybe the remedies and terms of

6

judicial review ought to be different.

7

MR. MASSEY:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

8

seriousness with which the lower courts address this

9

problem is not really going to be affected by the standard

10

of review.

I think the message has been sent in Gore and

11

has been received, and the courts have shown themselves

12

quite willing to step in and reverse verdicts that the

13

perceive to be excessive, and I -- we believe that the de

2

In this instance, when you have highly

3

fact-intensive questions I think the message sent by a de

sort of undermining the district court's willingness to

grapple with the record, knowing that whatever he does is

going to be reviewed again by the -- by his brethren on

QUESTION:

But that's quite different than the

that historically the review of a jury verdict is very,

2

for this kind of punitive excessiveness is very grudging,

3

but we passed that point and we said, yes, there can be

some review, and that review to begin with can take place

5

by a trial judge, and a trial judge who is performing

6

what, I think, functionally is an abuse of discretion

7

review of what the jury did, informed by particular Gore

factors and so on, can set it aside.

9

Once we have passed the point of saying there

10

can be that kind of review by the trial judge, what is it

11

historically that would have a bearing on the question,

12

whether the appellate court's review of the trial judge is

either de novo or abuse of discretion?

The courts did not treat the two differently and, in fact,

in footnote 7 of Cooper's reply brief they discuss the

common law tradition of treating them similarly,

indistinguishably, in fact, in the same verdicts, so we

I would just like to add, and this uniformity

notion that we've heard about, first we believe the

this Court in TXO essentially rejected a proposal for

The BMW factors are
