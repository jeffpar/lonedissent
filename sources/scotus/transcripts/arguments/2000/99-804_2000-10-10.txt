ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MOGIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. MOGIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether for purposes

12

of the Federal mail fraud statute a State or municipality

13

parts with property when it issues a license.

14

case, the Fifth Circuit has used a novel concept of

15

property to give the Federal Government the power to

16

police State and local license applications under the mail

17

fraud statute when State and local governments are fully

18

capable of administering and implementing their own

19

licensing schemes and punishing misconduct involving

20

licensing schemes when it occurs.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

In this

What would they be punished under?

What kind of State laws would cover -MR. MOGIN:

Well in this case, for example,

24

there's a false statement provision in the Louisiana video

25

poker statute.
3

1
2
3

QUESTION:

And that's fairly standard in State

licensing schemes?
MR. MOGIN:

I think it is, that there be a --

4

that false statements are ordinarily punished --

5

punishable by criminal provisions.

6

undertaken a survey of that.

7

I can't say that we've

In addition, in the area of gambling, Justice

8

Scalia, 18 U.S.C. 1955 is available for conducting an

9

illegal gambling enterprise and, in fact, that was one of

10

the charges here.

11

very theory was that the gambling operation was illegal

12

because of alleged false statements in the license

13

applications, so -- and that had also been the charge in

14

the Salvatore case, so that would be --

15

Petitioner was acquitted on it, and the

QUESTION:

Is it the case that the same would

16

apply to a Federal agency?

17

not peculiarly directed at State agencies.

18

MR. MOGIN:

This is not -- the statute is

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

19

Most of our argument would apply if this was a Federal

20

agency, although in this case we have the United States v.

21

Bass and the principle about not lightly interpreting

22

statutes to reach --

23

QUESTION:

But in any case it would be -- any

24

application for a permit to a Federal authority would be

25

susceptible to the same argument.
4

There's no distinction

1

that's being made, a Federal power against the State as

2

against the Federal Government.

3

MR. MOGIN:

Under the Fifth Circuit's analysis I

4

think it would be possible that a Federal license

5

application perhaps could be prosecuted if it met the

6

Fifth Circuit's test, which is somewhat difficult to

7

discern from the opinion, but there's nothing in what the

8

Fifth Circuit says that would confine it to a State

9

application, if that answers your question.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MOGIN:

12

QUESTION:

Or in the statute.
Right.
Mr. Mogin, I think it would be

13

helpful if we focused somewhat on the statutory language

14

in this case to figure out what it covers, and we have to

15

read it, I suppose, in light of this Court's decision in

16

McNally, which does appear to suggest that it -- the

17

statute covers only the scheme to defraud the victim of

18

money or property, although the statute doesn't say so in

19

so many words.

20

Now, let me ask you this.

Here, I take it the

21

State did more than just issue a license.

It issued a

22

license with an ongoing substantial revenue component for

23

the State.

24

fee and then you have this forever.

25

it not, the payment of substantial amounts of money to the

It wasn't just a one-time payment of a license

5

It contemplates, does

1

State thereafter, and does that distinguish it, or make it

2

somehow more of a property interest than otherwise might

3

be the case?

4

MR. MOGIN:

Justice O'Connor, there is no

5

question the State is taking a substantial share of the

6

revenue from video poker operations in Louisiana, but we

7

don't see how that gives rise to any property interest.

8

Certainly, under the analysis in College Savings Bank,

9

cited by this Court in 1999, the fact that there's a

10

pecuniary interest involved would not establish a property

11

right.

12

QUESTION:

Well, taking money from the victim is

13

covered, according to McNally, so is it taking money from

14

the State, in a sense, because of this revenues --

15

MR. MOGIN:

No, Justice O'Connor, we would say

16

it is not.

17

operations as a source of revenue for the State, and it

18

has been a very significant source of revenue for the

19

State.

20

was not paid that shouldn't have been paid in terms of the

21

State's pro rata share and, really, the States here --

22

To the contrary, the State views video poker

There was no allegation in this case that anything

QUESTION:

Did the State ever argue that it has

23

an interest in assuring the users of these machines that

24

the operators are honest and that by this alleged

25

misstatement the goodwill, the confidence that the State
6

1

has in its own licenses is somehow diminished, and that

2

that's a taking of property, and of course you might say

3

this is intangible property, but did they ever make that

4

sort of argument?

5

MR. MOGIN:

No, I don't believe that that

6

argument has been made by the Government and, of course,

7

there's no question that the regulatory scheme is designed

8

to ensure the honesty and suitability of licensees.

9

argument was not made, that I recall.

That

I mean, there's

10

been no question that the licensing process serves a

11

legitimate purpose to identify appropriate licensees, but

12

it's hard to see how that would be a property --

13

QUESTION:

Are the licenses limited in number?

14

MR. MOGIN:

No, they're not, Justice Kennedy.

15

QUESTION:

Would that have made a difference?

16

It would be like a taxi cab medallion in New York or

17

something?

18

MR. MOGIN:

Well, it's our position that even if

19

there were a limitation to some large number of licenses,

20

that the same analysis would apply, but certainly that

21

would be a factor to consider, and when you get to a very

22

limited number of licenses, you may have a different

23

analysis, because then there's -- people are actually

24

competing with each other for a license, and something

25

important is being given away by the State.
7

1

QUESTION:

Well, but even in that case, how

2

would it affect any property interest of the State, unless

3

you could show that the person who got the license somehow

4

intended to exercise the rights under it, less than some

5

other holder might have done, and thereby produce less

6

revenue from the State, which is at least on the face of

7

it counterintuitive, because the State and the licensee

8

has the same interest in maximizing the amount of gambling

9

that goes on, but save in that odd situation, how would a

10

limited number of licenses affect your property analysis?

11

MR. MOGIN:

Well, I think that you're right, the

12

mere fact that there's a limitation on the number would

13

not, in our view, give rise to a property deprivation.

14

It's one factor to consider, and --

15

QUESTION:

Would it be a basis for saying that

16

there is a property interest at all, where there is not,

17

as you argue, under these circumstances?

18

MR. MOGIN:

Well, we think the term license is

19

used in many different contexts, radio licenses, whatnot.

20

There may be situations in which the State is giving away

21

only one or 5 or 10 licenses, and our analysis doesn't

22

foreclose what would happen in such a case, but here

23

there's a mere grant of Government permission.

24

nothing in what the Government is doing that can be

25

analogized to giving away an easement.
8

There's

The applicants are

1

not competing with each other, so I simply --

2

QUESTION:

That would be true if there were just

3

one license being given away, if there were only one

4

gambling casino allowed in the whole State.

I mean, you

5

know, do you stand by your analysis or not?

It seems to

6

me if you stand by your analysis you have to say -- it

7

would be a more appealing case, I suppose, if there were

8

only one license, but on the analysis that you've brought

9

us, even if there's only one license, there's no property

10

involved, isn't that right?

11

MR. MOGIN:

That is our position, Justice

12

Scalia.

The one -- the difference is, if there were only

13

one license, then the State really would be losing

14

something in giving away the license.

15

think that that's a property right, but there's certainly

16

no clear definition in the cases of what property is.

We still would not

17

QUESTION:

Well, I don't --

18

QUESTION:

How does the State lose something

19

giving away one license, but not lose something giving

20

away a number of licenses?

21

MR. MOGIN:

Well, if -- Mr. Chief Justice, if

22

there were only one license available, and if it were

23

understood that once given it couldn't be taken back, then

24

perhaps it could be said that the State was losing

25

something because by giving the license it lost the
9

1

ability to give it to anyone else.

2
3

QUESTION:

licenses or 100 licenses, doesn't it?

4
5

But that's true if it gives away 10

MR. MOGIN:

Well, in this scheme, if 10 licenses

are given out for video poker --

6

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

If it's an infinite

7

number, sure, they can always create one more license, but

8

I don't see how that affects the property analysis as

9

opposed to a regulatory analysis.

10

MR. MOGIN:

And we don't disagree.

The

11

additional point we'd make is that there's no reason to

12

stretch the concept of property, as the Fifth Circuit did

13

in this case.

14

designed, drafted, implemented by State and local

15

officials.

16

position to interpret them, to decide whether they've been

17

violated in a particular case.

18

during the early years of the Louisiana video poker

19

scheme, and State and local officials can decide the

20

appropriate sanction, if there is misconduct.

21

State licensing schemes, of course, are

Those are the officials that are in the best

This case, in fact, arose

Now, the Government argues that this license is

22

special because the State has a substantial economic stake

23

in the -- in video poker operations.

24

since when has the existence of a property right depended

25

on something as amorphous as whether there's a substantial
10

We would respond,

1

economic stake, or the reach of a criminal statute?

2

That's not an appropriate test for defining criminal

3

liability.

4

There would be a whole host of questions that

5

would be raised under the Government's theory.

How much

6

is substantial?

7

Should it be the percentage?

8

revenues the licensing authority has, so that it might

9

have a different situation if the license was issued by a

Is it a dollar amount that counts?
Does it matter what other

10

poor rural county as opposed to a wealthy, suburban

11

county.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Mogin, what do you do with the

13

Government's argument that under the second clause of the

14

statute you don't need a victim?

15

pursuant to a scheme to defraud, and so forth and so on.

16

MR. MOGIN:

They obtain money

Justice Stevens, we have a number of

17

responses to that.

18

which is made in our brief, that is not before the Court,

19

because it wasn't raised until the brief on the merits.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MOGIN:

Passing over the procedural point

An alternative basis to affirm.
Right.

We've argued in our brief

22

that under the Tuttle decision and other decisions this

23

Court has only rarely considered issues raised by the

24

respondent for the first time in the brief on the merits,

25

but on the merits of the point, the Court was unanimous in
11

1

McNally that the 1909 amendment merely codified Durland,

2

and McNally held that the statute is limited in scope to

3

the protection of property rights, and that when the

4

Government is the alleged victim, and I quote, any benefit

5

which the Government derives from the statute must be

6

limited to the Government's interest as property holder.

7

So that was then reaffirmed -- the basic holding

8

was reaffirmed in Carpenter, and I think it was a premise

9

of Neder, the Neder decision in 1999 as well, as we've

10

explained in our brief, and we've also covered the

11

background of the 1909 amendment in our brief, the

12

commission report, which there's really no suggestion that

13

Congress was attempting to create a new basis of

14

liability.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MOGIN:

17

QUESTION:

How many years since McNally?
13 years.

That was decided in 1987.

So we can assume that someone in

18

Congress knew of this Court's interpretation and could

19

have done something about it if it disagreed.

20

MR. MOGIN:

That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and

21

in fact in 1988 the statute was amended to deal with

22

honest services cases, which had been thought to be the

23

most important application of intangible rights doctrine,

24

and those were brought under the statute if there was a

25

deprivation of honest services.
12

1

Even today, just acquiring someone's services is

2

not enough.

3

of honest services, but Congress in 1988 did not otherwise

4

change the McNally ruling, even though it was fully aware

5

of it.

6

You have to have a scheme to deprive another

QUESTION:

Would you give me an example -- maybe

7

the most obvious example you can think of -- of the

8

deprivation of honest services?

9

that term refers to.

10

MR. MOGIN:

I may not understand what

Justice Souter, that refers to the

11

principle that an employer has a right to expect that an

12

employee will provide honest services, and so --

13
14

QUESTION:

What kinds of acts would be

forbidden?

15

MR. MOGIN:

A scheme involving kickbacks, for

16

example, where the employee is paid a kickback to divert

17

business.

18
19

QUESTION:

Basically any kind of corruption on

the part of the employee.

20

MR. MOGIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. MOGIN:

Yes.
Yes.
The theory that the Government has

23

presented a substantial economic stake, if adopted, would

24

raise all kinds of thorny applications, thorny questions

25

in application, which would be particularly troublesome,
13

1

because it's a criminal statute, so the trial judges would

2

be required to explain the standard to the jury so the

3

jury could apply it in a particular case, and that makes

4

the situation particularly intolerable.

5

The State's expectation of receiving revenue

6

simply does not mean that when the State issues a license

7

it parts with property.

8

Bank case, I think that makes it clear that even business

9

in the sense of -- the Court said business in the sense of

To go back to the College Savings

10

the activity of doing business and making a profit is not

11

property, so the State's mere expectation of obtaining

12

revenue after a license is issued.

13

QUESTION:

Are there other licenses, State

14

licenses where the Government's revenue is a percentage of

15

the proceeds of the business, as distinguished from the

16

tax on the income?

17

MR. MOGIN:

Well, yes, in the area of hotels, of

18

course, rooms are taxed generally based on occupancy, so

19

that in New York City, for example, the city would obtain

20

very substantial revenue from the occupancy tax.

21

it was over 20 percent.

22

reduced to about 15 percent.

23

QUESTION:

Formerly

In the mid-nineties it was
Now, that's called a tax.

Some States administer their sales

24

tax by issuing licenses to do business, don't they, and

25

all it means is that you have to pay a sales tax on your
14

1
2

gross receipts.
MR. MOGIN:

That's common, and taxes can be

3

quite substantial, and the Governments raise money, of

4

course, through fees and charges of all sorts, not merely

5

assessments that are called taxes, so the fact that the

6

State is getting significant revenue here -- I don't know

7

why that indicates that it's losing property when it

8

issues the license.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Mogin, I can probably find this

10

out myself, but on this issue, had this issue arisen

11

before McNally was decided?

12

post McNally cases.

13

MR. MOGIN:

I know there were a bunch of

Well, there were limited instances,

14

and there was case called United States v. Green, brought

15

in California, a prosecution involving obtaining a

16

driver's license, and the State prosecuted that under the

17

intangible rights theory.

18

case that I'm aware of.

19

That's really the only clear

There are a couple of cases involving licenses,

20

and because the intangible rights theory had been widely

21

accepted in the courts of appeals, that was the doctrine

22

that was generally relied on when a license was involved.

23

So it's our submission --

24
25

QUESTION:

What about an automobile license, a

vehicle license?
15

1

Supposing there's a fraudulent application for a

2

vehicle license and the Government says, well, we did part

3

with property, it cost us 76 cents to make that license,

4

although they get $300 for it.

5

MR. MOGIN:

Well, the courts of appeals at least

6

I think have been in agreement that the mere cost of

7

printing the paper for the license is to de minimis to

8

support a charge, and so the analysis has focused on

9

whether some other -- on some other basis it can be said

10

that the State is losing property.

11

We think the Government's theory of liability in

12

this case is contrary to traditional law, is not supported

13

by any established concept of property, and of course the

14

Government is doing this in a criminal case.

15

Civil RICO plaintiffs, of course, could take

16

advantage of the theory if it were endorsed by the Court,

17

and the very novelty of the theory makes an inadequate

18

basis for injecting Federal law into the area of State

19

laws, local licensing, so for that reason we submit the

20

petitioner's conviction should be reversed.

21
22
23
24
25

If there are no further questions, I reserve the
balance of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Mogin.

Mr. Dreeben,

we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
16

1
2
3
4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A video poker license is property both in the

5

hands of the State and in the hands of the licensee.

6

Petitioner's scheme therefore violates both the first and

7

the second clauses of the mail fraud statute.

8
9

I'll address first why a video poker license is
property in the hands of the State.

A video poker license

10

represents the State's right to a stream of payments from

11

an enormously lucrative business, a business that the

12

State has absolute power to conduct itself.

13

conducting the business itself, the State franchises that

14

opportunity to private individuals while asserting control

15

over every aspect of the business and retaining a right to

16

a large share of the revenues.

17

QUESTION:

Instead of

By --

How has that property interest been

18

infringed in any way, because there's no claim, as I

19

understand it, and I don't know whether your argument

20

suggests that there was any intent here to deprive the

21

State of its licensing fees, and no intent here to deprive

22

the State of its percentage, and no intent here, in

23

effect, to conduct less gambling than would otherwise be

24

possible in order to minimize revenue, so even if we

25

accept your theory that there are property interests that
17

1

the State can claim, how have any of them been infringed

2

on the allegations of this complaint?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, I would agree that

4

if there were a direct fraud at money or property of the

5

State in a tangible form or in a financial form, that

6

would be an easier case than this one.

7

This case, I suggest the best way to look at it

8

is to start from the premise that the State is to be

9

treated as any property owner under the mail fraud

10

statute.

11

private individual similarly situated, and to understand

12

how the State loses property, you have to compare the

13

State to a similarly situated private individual.

14

It is to be no less and no more protected than a

Now, the two analogies that most readily show

15

how the State loses an intangible property right are a

16

private franchise business, which has the right to

17

exercise franchises and grant franchises to private

18

parties, and has a contract right not to be defrauded in

19

choosing the franchisees that it chooses.

20

QUESTION:

But I don't see where the fraud comes

21

into it.

In other words, the only basis upon which I can

22

see any fraud here, if we start with the assumptions that

23

I made, that there's no claim that they were minimizing

24

business or skimping on the percentage or whatnot, the

25

only basis to say that there has been -- that the State
18

1

has been defrauded of something is to say that the

2

property right must be some kind of metaphysical entity

3

that somehow goes beyond the right to receive the fees,

4

and the right to receive the percentage, and I don't know

5

why we should take that step and recognize some kind of a

6

metaphysical property right in addition to these quite

7

easily defined property interests.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:
property right.

Well, it's not a metaphysical

It is an intangible property right, and

10

under this Court's decision in Carpenter v. United States,

11

intangible property rights are just as protected as

12

tangible ones.

13

right is identified is by looking at the legal scheme that

14

creates those rights, and Louisiana created a legal scheme

15

under which it has the exclusive right to determine who

16

may engage in the video poker business.

17

Now, the way that an intangible property

QUESTION:

Okay, but as I understand it, then,

18

the -- what I was sort of disparaging as the metaphysical

19

right is basically the State's regulatory interest.

20

has nothing to do directly -- well, strike that.

21

right of -- to dispose of licenses conceived of as

22

something connected to but nonetheless distinguishable

23

from the right to receive the fee, the right to receive

24

the percentage and so on.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

It

It is a

It is both a regulatory and a
19

1

proprietary interest.

2

QUESTION:

But if we were to say, we're going to

3

distinguish for purposes of this statute between the

4

State's regulatory interest and the State's property

5

interest, then you'd have to lose, wouldn't you?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

No, because I would define the

7

State's property interest more broadly than simply the

8

actual currency that is received under the license.

9
10

QUESTION:

Did the State lose any revenue here

because of the fraud?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

We didn't charge or attempt

12

to prove that the State lost revenue and, in fact,

13

Louisiana connects the gambling, the video poker terminals

14

to a central computer to ensure that skimming of revenues

15

does not occur.

16

QUESTION:

Well then, why isn't Justice Souter's

17

question correct, that you're not talking about any

18

orthodox property interest here that was lost to the

19

State.

20

authority.

21

You're talking about a loss of its regulatory

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I think we are talking about a

22

property interest that in the private sector would clearly

23

be recognized as such.

24

closely to a contract interest of a party that runs a

25

franchise business and selects its own franchisees, and if

It would be analogizeable most

20

1

it is lied to by the franchisees, it is defrauded in it's

2

act of letting a contract to that franchise holder.

QUESTION:

7

But in a private action you have to

MR. DREEBEN:

That is true, but under the mail

fraud statute we do not.
QUESTION:

Well, I know.

8

your analogy is quite imperfect.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

That's why I think

I think that the analogy is an

10

analogy which attempts to compare the State to a private

11

party, and the difference is that the State can always be

12

said in some sense to be acting as a regulator.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Were there money damages in Carpenter

to the Wall Street Journal?
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

There were no money damages

16

in the Wall Street Journal case at all, because all the

17

Wall Street Journal lost was its exclusive right to

18

determine when to publish certain columns, and Winans and

19

Carpenter were accused in that case of having taken from

20

the Journal their right, the Journal's right to decide

21

when to disclose the contents of that column.

22

It was highly intangible.

It's an interest only

23

created by law, and by direct analogy here the interest

24

that is created is Louisiana's interest in deciding which

25

proprietary parties will work with it in the video

Louisiana give itself a license and go into the video

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:
answer is no.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Under Louisiana law, could the

State of Louisiana sell to Mr. Joe Smith, a private
citizen, the right to give out franchises to others?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

has that authority.

15

QUESTION:

16

Under the Louisiana law, the

Under Louisiana law --

Yes.
-- I don't believe that the State

No, I don't think so, either.

Therefore, it doesn't sound like McDonald's at all.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

18

QUESTION:

Well, it would be --

I mean, McDonald's can give the right

19

to sell to others.

McDonald's has something that's

20

valuable because it could go into business itself.

21

do what it wants.

It can

22

MR. DREEBEN:

The State --

23

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, that's your analogy.

24

MR. DREEBEN:

The State could choose to operate

25

in precisely that manner.

The State could have -22

1

QUESTION:

Oh, of course, under the Constitution

2

it could, of the United States, but the question is, what

3

is the scheme that Louisiana has set up under positive

4

law.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6

QUESTION:

But I think --

And under positive law, I'm just

7

saying in the two respects I mentioned it does not sound

8

like McDonald's.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, I agree with you

10

that the State has not assigned to itself the right to

11

sell video poker licenses.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

QUESTION:

15

It couldn't under the statute.

16

Could not.

It could not.

No, I don't see any reason --

No, it could under the Constitution.

MR. DREEBEN:

Under its own statute, but if

17

you're looking at the legal rights that it has invested in

18

itself, it is as if Louisiana has made the State the

19

exclusive holder and determiner of who may participate in

20

the video poker industry with a substantial revenue share

21

being assigned back to the State.

22

The State could have done the exact same thing

23

in a different manner.

It could have said, you, the

24

State, shall select someone who will choose all these

25

State franchise holders who will do the video poker
23

1

business and it could have sold that interest, could have

2

said, a private party can take over the role of deciding

3

who gets a license and collect all the money and give some

4

of the money back to the State, but it did not do that.

5

Instead, it retained those legal rights in itself, and

6

those legal rights would have been viewed as property had

7

a private property holder exercised them.

8
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, how does that differ

from giving out liquor licenses, or giving out taxi

10

medallions?

11

spreads, and as I read it in your brief it seems very far.

12

My question is, how far this theory of yours

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, it spreads only

13

to those licenses and those State activities that are

14

generically speaking more in a proprietary mold than in a

15

regulatory mold, and there is a classification question

16

that arises.

17

share some features with the Louisiana scheme and,

18

therefore, arguably both of those would fall on the

19

property side of the equation.

20

QUESTION:

Both liquor licenses and taxi medallions

Well, tell me, what is the

21

Government's position?

22

fall under the Government's theory, and which ones would

23

be left out?

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

What falls, what licenses would

Our position is that a purely

regulatory license, such as a license to practice
24

1

medicine, or a driver's license, is not encompassed within

2

this theory of property, but a license, or a regulatory

3

proprietary scheme such as a franchise scheme, or a

4

license that is very closely linked in the revenue stream

5

that goes back to the State and in the regulatory

6

component is.

7

QUESTION:

Well, suppose there is, like with the

8

example of the hotel and the occupancy tax that Mr. Mogin

9

raised, or people who run liquor establishments get a much

10

higher tax than people who are in other businesses.

11

That's special to that business.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Do those qualify?

I think that they do under a

13

strict analytical approach, but I also think that there is

14

a component to the analysis that is narrower than assuming

15

that all such licenses fall within the scope of the mail

16

fraud statute, and --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben -- if you answered the

18

question -- it seems to me that you really -- the property

19

right that I would think of in terms of normal usage would

20

be the right to exclude as one of the bundle of rights,

21

but you don't claim the right to exclude is sufficient,

22

because you would not include the bar, the control of the

23

membership in the bar, is that right?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You are not claiming -- every right
25

1

to exclude is not a --

2

MR. DREEBEN:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But then I don't -- I really don't

4

understand why it makes any difference that the State

5

shares in the revenues.

6

different case if they didn't, they just taxed the video

7

people on some income basis, rather than sharing in the

8

revenues.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't see why it would be a

Well, I think if there was no

10

linkage between the taxation and the licensing scheme,

11

then it's harder to say that the State is acting in a

12

proprietary than in a regulatory --

13

QUESTION:

But even if it's acting in a

14

proprietary way, it's not deprived of any revenue.

15

not deprived of anything, except the right to exclude

16

these people, and that's not itself sufficient.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

It's

It's not itself sufficient, but in

18

combination with a scheme such as this, that creates in

19

the State the power to participate in a particular

20

industry, and to select, in effect, the participants in

21

the industry, the agents who will carry out the work, the

22

State has acted in a way that far more closely resembles a

23

franchise business than it does a pure, sovereign

24

regulator, and that is the question that has to be asked

25

under the mail fraud statute.
26

1

QUESTION:

I don't --

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, you seem to be -- the

3

Government's position seems to be somewhat of a shifting

4

target.

5

itself is deprived of property under this scheme, and when

6

it's a proprietary licensing scheme that is the situation.

7

You appear to be arguing today that the State

I thought in your brief the focus was an

8

argument to the effect that the statute is satisfied so

9

long as the licensee gets some kind of money or property.

10

It doesn't matter if the victim, here the State, is

11

deprived of property.

12

now?

Are you abandoning that argument

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

QUESTION:

15

It was new.

MR. DREEBEN:

17

QUESTION:

19

22
23

I don't think it was

pressed below.

16

18

No, Justice --

Correct.

But do you still adhere to that as

well?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, I do.

It is our alternative

theory of why -QUESTION:

Is there any reason why we should

address it, since it came so late in the day?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the Court has discretion to

24

address it.

It certainly isn't required to address it.

25

We did not argue it below.

But I will say that in favor
27

1

of the Court addressing it and resolving it is that it is

2

a purely legal argument that the Government made in

3

McNally, that the Court did not squarely address in

4

McNally for a variety of --

5

QUESTION:

Well, by implication McNally seemed

6

to assume that it was -- the statute covers only money or

7

property obtained from the victim.

8

opinion seems to be focused, anyway.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, that's how the

Well, there is language in

10

McNally, without doubt, that reads that way, but that

11

language could not have announced a holding in McNally,

12

because the actual holding of McNally was, in addition to

13

the well-known part of McNally that an intangible right to

14

good government is not a property right, the Court also

15

held that there was no deception of the State and there

16

were no false statements made to any third party, so there

17

was no factual predicate in McNally itself for deciding

18

whether the second clause applies.

19

QUESTION:

I suppose one argument in favor of

20

exercising our discretion here is that we took the case to

21

construe the meaning of a statute, there's a conflict in

22

the circuits, and to say, you know, we're construing it

23

this way but there's another argument that we might accede

24

to in some other case wouldn't be the best use of our

25

resources.
28

1
2

MR. DREEBEN:

I agree, Mr. Chief Justice,

particularly --

3

QUESTION:

But you say that's what we did in

4

McNally.

You said this argument was available there and

5

we chose not to address it, and to leave everything sort

6

of up in the air.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, there is --

I mean, I was here in McNally.

I

didn't realize we had done that.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, there is actually no

11

discussion in the opinion itself of the theory that the

12

Government raised that the false statements alone, when

13

the defendant obtains property, are sufficient.

14

QUESTION:

Oh, you're saying we did in McNally

15

what you are now arguing it would be irresponsible for us

16

to do now.

17

thought we had addressed the statute.

18

I don't think we did that in McNally.

MR. DREEBEN:

I

Well, as I said, Justice Scalia,

19

there -- the square holdings of McNally did not require

20

the Court to come to a definitive answer to it, and if you

21

read the McNally opinion, which is fairly brief, it

22

doesn't identify and reject in terms this theory.

23

What the McNally opinion does do is point out

24

that the second clause of the statute, which was added in

25

1909, has the effect of codifying this Court's decision in
29

1

Durland v. United States, which held that --

5

QUESTION:

6

If --- false promises come within the

That's contrary to your

interpretation of what the amendment did.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

No, it's not contrary to it.

8

think that the amendment did more than that.

9

at least codifies Durland.

It clearly

There's no question about

10

that.

11

require that there be a deprivation of property.

12

I

But the plain language of the statute does not

QUESTION:

But if it did more than that, we

13

should have said that in McNally.

14

it just did this, which would have reached the result that

15

we reached in McNally, and simply ignored the fact that it

16

did more than that, which would have produced a different

17

result in McNally.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

We shouldn't have said,

It would not have produced a

19

different result in McNally, Justice Scalia, because the

20

Court made quite clear in footnote 9 of its opinion that

21

there was no deception of the State at all.

22

The Government's theory in McNally was that

23

State officeholders who have an adverse interest to the

24

State are required to disclose it to the State, and this

25

Court said in footnote 9 of McNally that we should not
30

1

assume that there was any such duty of disclosure, and

2

without a duty of disclosure, there could have been no

3

fraud that would have triggered the second clause of the

4

statute.

5

QUESTION:

You also would never reach the

6

principal holding of McNally if you're going to put all of

7

the weight on that footnote.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

The Court could have decided the

case based on that analysis, but it decided it on a

10

broader analysis, which is --

11

QUESTION:

12

Right.

I don't think footnote --

what note was it?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

QUESTION:

Footnote 9.
-- 9, I don't think footnote 9 was

15

meant to preclude the question that's before us here, any

16

more than it was meant to preclude the question of whether

17

intangible services can qualify under the statute.

18

Certainly everybody assumed that's what the case decided,

19

despite footnote 9.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

What I think is evident from

21

McNally is that the Court at various points in the opinion

22

wrote broadly about the mail fraud statute.

23

a distinct theory of liability that we briefed before this

24

Court in McNally and that was not addressed in terms, and

25

I think that there is an explanation for why that theory
31

But there is

1

was not addressed, which is that there were no false

2

representations to anybody that were charged in the jury

3

instructions that could have supported that theory.

4

QUESTION:

If we did have that, if that theory's

5

in front of us, it seemed a little broad.

6

it would make guilty of mail fraud -- I was thinking, you

7

know, Richard, on the Survivors program --

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

10

You don't know that.

It seemed that

But I mean, he

seemed absolutely guilty under your interpretation --

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

-- and then I thought that

13

probably -- probably any competitor, by the way, in a

14

commercial context, anybody who lies to his competitor,

15

any boss who lies to his subordinate, any subordinate who

16

lies to his boss or a coworker, they're all out to get

17

money, and they're telling lies or scheming to get money,

18

just like Richard on the Survivors program, and I was a

19

little surprised that the Government is suddenly going to

20

make criminal under the mail fraud statute -- I mean,

21

bring back Cotton Mather.

22

I mean, this is -- any lying in a commercial

23

context where you're trying to get money out of it is now

24

mail fraud.

25

Is that right?

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't want to speak to
32

1

Richard in the Survivors, since --

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. DREEBEN:

-- we haven't charged that case

4

and I'm not familiar with it.

5

QUESTION:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. DREEBEN:

I hope not.

But as far as the breadth of the

8

theory, it is a broad theory.

9

Breyer, whether it covers all of the hypotheticals in your

10

question, but it is a broader theory than the license as a

11

proprietary activity theory, because it would apply

12

whenever an individual lies for the purpose of

13

obtaining property --

14

QUESTION:

I'm not sure, Justice

So what I'm most worried about in

15

that, of course, is that it is possible, you know, that

16

competitors in a commercial context may tell each other

17

lies sometime.

18

your competitor goes you stay home and take his customer

19

away.

I'm going to the trade show, and then when

Well, each one of those is a RICO suit, and I --

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so.

No?
No.

I think there is a

23

materiality component in the mail fraud statute that this

24

Court described in Neder v. United States --

25

QUESTION:

It's material.
33

You get your

1

competitor to go to the trade show and then while he's

2

away you take his customer.

3

money there.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

There was quite a lot of

I haven't tried to frame this as

5

an application that would sweep in routine commercial

6

conduct.

7

QUESTION:

But you said you were going to treat

8

the Government just as a private person would be treated

9

under this statute that was -- but are you saying that's

10

true of the theory that it's property in the hands of the

11

Government as well, and not true under this alternative

12

theory?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Ginsburg, but in this

14

particular case what the defendant did was lie to the

15

State, concealing adverse facts about his background in

16

order to obtain a valuable license, which --

17

QUESTION:

Well, that could apply, at least in

18

the cases you excluded from your first theory.

19

the license to practice law, the license to practice

20

medicine, those are very valuable in the hands of the

21

recipient.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23

QUESTION:

That is,

That is true.

And I think sometimes when they

24

divide property on termination of marriage those are

25

attributed a monetary value.
34

1

MR. DREEBEN:

That is true, and there is yet

2

another theory of the mail fraud statute which we have not

3

raised in this case and we haven't briefed in this case,

4

which holds that lying to, for example, the State in order

5

to obtain a regulatory approval that will then allow

6

someone to obtain money from a third party fits within

7

even the first clause of the mail fraud statute.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, my problem with your large

interpretation, Mr. Dreeben, is you're essentially making

10

the Federal Government monitors of what would be a false

11

statement to a Government agency.

12

operates on the Federal level.

13

18 U.S.C. 1001, that

You're just saying, well, we do the same thing

14

with overall monitoring, of making a false statement to a

15

Government official, State or Federal, and that's the kind

16

of thing, if Congress meant to do, shouldn't it be

17

required to speak clearly?

18

rule apply to that level of monitoring, false statements

19

made to State agencies?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Shouldn't a clear statement

I think, Justice Ginsburg, that

21

Congress has attempted to speak very clearly and

22

comprehensively in the mail fraud statute.

23

Court ruled in McNally that it did not apply to the

24

intangible right to honest services, Congress came back

25

and amended the statute to make clear that it did want the
35

When this

1
2

Federal Government in that line of business.
QUESTION:

Well now, wait.

It was a later

3

Congress that decided that's what they wanted to do.

4

doesn't have anything to say about what the earlier

5

Congress intended when they passed this fraud statute.

6
7
8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

That

I don't suggest that it does,

Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

These were different people in

Congress, after McNally, and they decided that they agreed

10

with the Government that there should be a way to get

11

these people, but that says nothing at all about whether

12

the statute, as originally drafted by another Congress

13

many years ago, all of whom are gone, meant what we said

14

it meant in McNally.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Even taking the Court's own

16

holding in McNally, the Court's holding is that the State

17

is not to be less favored than a private party insofar as

18

it's a property holder.

19

It's to be treated on the same footing if the

20

defendant uses a Federal jurisdictional means which

21

subjects him to a Federal regulatory system, and there are

22

lots and lots of defendants who make false statements to

23

Governments in connection with obtaining money or property

24

or even defrauding a State of tax revenue, which some

25

people might think are quintessential things for the
36

1

States to handle all on their own.

2

QUESTION:

I don't know whether one -- 18 U.S.C.

3

1001 was passed before or after the mail fraud statute,

4

but the Government, intimated by Justice Ginsburg, really

5

doesn't need 1001 if you're right about the mail fraud

6

statute.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the elements of the two

8

statutes are different, and there are many applications

9

where 1001 would fit where we wouldn't necessarily be

10

able to establish a scheme to defraud under the mail fraud

11

statute, so the --

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Well, can you give me perhaps one of

those?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, you'd -- under our second

15

theory, we do not need to show that there is an intent to

16

deprive the State or the Federal Government of a property

17

interest, whereas --

18
19
20
21

QUESTION:

So you say basically the mail fraud

is much broader than 1001.
MR. DREEBEN:

In some ways it's broader, and in

some ways it's narrower.

22

QUESTION:

In what way is it narrower?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, mail fraud requires a use of

24

the jurisdictional means that you have mail fraud, and it

25

also under the scheme to -- you need to have proof of the
37

1
2

mails in other words, which is not true for 1001.
1001 involves any Federal agency, any false

3

statement in a matter within the Federal agency's

4

jurisdiction, and it need not involve any money or

5

property loss or gain.

6
7
8
9
10

So the two statutes have a substantially
different sweep.
QUESTION:

If it's only the jurisdictional peg,

I guess the wire -- isn't there -- there are parallel
statute that deals with use of wire communications?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

Correct.

12

QUESTION:

Which --

13

QUESTION:

It seems to me there's hardly any

14

application for anything that wouldn't use one or the

15

other, a telephone or the mail.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

That may be true, and there's also

17

an intent element, though, in the mail fraud statute of an

18

intent to defraud, which is not present in the 1001.

19

simply applies to a knowing false statement within the

20

jurisdiction of a Federal agency.

21

QUESTION:

1001

Would your theory apply, assuming

22

there's a mailing, of course, to false statements in an

23

employment application?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

QUESTION:

To the State?

Yes.

You want to get a State job,
38

1

and you lie about your background in some way, misstate

2

your age, or you say you were never caught speeding or

3

something like that.

4

Would it apply?

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, certainly the second clause

5

as we have construed it would apply in such a case,

6

because the employment applicant seeks employment.

7

10

QUESTION:

What about a misstatement in a tax

return, State-filed tax return?
MR. DREEBEN:

A misstatement that is intended to

result in a greater tax --

11

QUESTION:

Greater deduction, or lesser tax.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

But Justice Scalia, that

13

would be covered under anybody's interpretation of the

14

mail fraud statute, because it's a scheme to acquire money

15

or property that should belong to the State, and that's

16

fundamentally --

17

QUESTION:

It's a scheme to keep your own

18

property, which you're supposed to give to the State.

19

not sure that anything is being taken from the State.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I'm

No, the State has a right to --

You don't read the statute too

closely, do you?
MR. DREEBEN:

I think that I read the statute

24

broadly in respect of money or property losses to the

25

State, and apply it in a way that makes it congruent with
39

1

what a private party would be subjected to.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, I have, I guess, a basic

3

problem with how we even get to your second theory,

4

because as I understand it the trial judge in this case

5

charged the jury simply on the theory of depriving the

6

third party of property, so I don't see how we could even

7

get into this if we wanted to.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

The trial judge combined the first

clause and the second clause of the statute which were

10

charged in the indictment.

He combined them by saying a

11

scheme to defraud by making false or fraudulent

12

representations to the State.

13

QUESTION:

But he did it on a theory of

14

defrauding, i.e., getting the other person's property,

15

didn't he?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

He did, but a jury that found

17

guilt on those instructions necessarily found that the

18

object of the scheme was to make false statements to the

19

State to obtain the license and, indeed, the charged

20

mailings were the mailings of the license to the

21

defendants.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

So you're saying it's like lesser-

included?
MR. DREEBEN:

It's exactly included within what

the jury had to find in order to render the conviction on
40

1

the instructions that were given.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, your alternate theory is

3

admittedly very broad.

4

employment application.

5

given to Federal prosecutors, given the tremendous

6

potential sweep of the statute as you construe it?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

You gave a yes answer to the
Is there any guidelines that are

There are no guidelines beyond the

8

legal requirements for charging mail fraud that are given

9

to Federal prosecutors.

10

QUESTION:

So the individual prosecutor can

11

decide if he or she would like to go after the would-be

12

employee who lied on an application for State employment?

13
14
15

MR. DREEBEN:

In theory.

In theory, Justice

Ginsburg.
I would also say that under the property prong

16

of mail fraud individual prosecutors have discretion on

17

what level of case they are going to bring, and the

18

competing obligations and case loads of Federal

19

prosecutors tend to send those cases to the wayside, but

20

there are small cases brought even where the State is

21

defrauded of a relatively small amount of property.

22

And one of the reasons why that is is because

23

frauds against the State often involve State actors in

24

collusion with the private parties, and the Federal

25

Government there serves a very valuable role in coming in
41

1

and being able to prosecute when the States themselves

2

seem to be less able to do so, and this case itself had a

3

corruption component in it involving charges against State

4

Senators, which the jury ended up rejecting, but there was

5

a reason why the Federal Government was involved in this

6

case in the beginning.

8

QUESTION:

You don't think the people of

Louisiana deserve the kind of government that they elect.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. DREEBEN:

I think the people of the State of

11

Louisiana are actually benefited by having the Federal

12

Government available as a supplementary prosecutorial

13

tool.

14

Thank you.

15

QUESTION:

16

Mr. Mogin, you have 11 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MOGIN

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MR. MOGIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we will waive

rebuttal unless there are questions.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish the Carpenter

22

case, because the Carpenter case held that the

23

confidential information of the Wall Street Journal was

24

traditionally protected as property because it would be

25

subject to protection in equity, et cetera.
42

1

MR. MOGIN:

The key distinction is that there

2

this Court was able to find prior law that recognized

3

confidential business information as property.

4

Ruckelshaus case in this Court, a case from -- the

5

International News case I believe it is, a treatise was

6

cited in the opinion.

7

indicating that confidential business information was

8

protected as property under the civil law, so the Court

9

was not required to announce a new theory of property in

10

The

There was substantial prior law

that case.

11

QUESTION:

May I ask this, Mr. Mogin.

The right

12

to exclude is mentioned over and over again in property

13

cases as one of the bundles of rights that's a property

14

right, and so forth.

15

this to the extreme it would go, but why isn't -- why

16

couldn't one view the video poker industry as an industry

17

that is controlled by the State and they have the right to

18

exclude newcomers, oldcomers, and that's just an old-

19

fashioned property right?

20

MR. MOGIN:

I know the Government doesn't press

Well, this Court has pointed out

21

that there's no precise or universal definition of

22

property.

23

and --

24
25

That's been said in some bankruptcy cases,

QUESTION:

But isn't it true that the right to

exclude is referred to in many, many property cases as a
43

1

strand of property right?

2

MR. MOGIN:

Yes, but I don't think that from

3

that one could conclude that every right to exclude is a

4

property right, because here you have the breadth of it,

5

that the licensing and approvals and permits and

6

certifications and registrations that the Government

7

issues is truly extraordinary.

8
9

It's never been thought that those are property
rights that the Government is exercising, and property law

10

has been formed -- is based a lot on history and

11

tradition, and not merely on characteristics.

12

one characteristic, such as the right to exclude, that can

13

be focused on and is the be-all and end-all of whether

14

there's a property right.

15

QUESTION:

There's no

Well, of course, in this case or in

16

any regulatory case, as distinct from the case of private

17

ownership or private property, there are two capacities, I

18

suppose, on the part of the supposed property owner, and

19

one is a regulatory capacity and one is arguably a

20

proprietary one, and I suppose -- I mean, wouldn't it be

21

your argument that the right to exclude would have to be

22

classified on the regulatory side rather than the property

23

side?

24
25

So in other words, the right to exclude is here,
but the reason it isn't property in the case of the
44

1

Government is that the Government holds it in a different

2

capacity as regulator, which is a capacity that the

3

private property owner doesn't have.

4

MR. MOGIN:

I think that's exactly right, and

5

that's why the Government prohibits all types of things,

6

excludes people from all types of activities.

7

The mere fact that the Government is excluding

8

something does not mean it's exercising a property right.

9

One has to look at the nature of the decision and see

10

whether the Government is acting in a regulatory or

11

proprietary capacity.

12

courts have always viewed licensing decisions and

13

revocation decisions as regulatory rather than

14

proprietary.
