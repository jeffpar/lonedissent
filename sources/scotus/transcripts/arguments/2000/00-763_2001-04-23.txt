ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN L. CALDWELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. CALDWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress never intended to include front pay as

12

a type of compensatory damages when it enacted the Civil

13

Rights Act of 1991.

14

Act itself, Section 2 of the Act, which provided that the

15

congressional purpose was to provide additional remedies.

16

This was intended to deter harassment and to prevent

17

intentional discrimination in the workplace, just as in

18

the Vinson case.

19

This is made clear by looking at the

This legislation was stated by Congress to be

20

necessary to provide these --

21

QUESTION:

What about the terms of the

22

legislation itself, rather than what members of Congress

23

might have said about it?

legislation itself, 1981a-(a)(1), it provides that the

It starts on page 1 and goes over

What Congress was saying was that we're not

changing what the status quo was.

16

they did it very carefully in (a)(1) of the Act.

QUESTION:

What was
We're simply

But, Ms. Caldwell, the status quo

8

that you're talking about is the status quo created by

courts, because at no point did the statute use the words

front pay.

11

MS. CALDWELL:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. CALDWELL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It did use the words back pay.
It did use the word back pay.

If

14

you look at the original language -- and it's provided

And that was the

1

QUESTION:

So the question boils down here to

2

whether or not so-called front pay is equitable relief,

3

doesn't it, as opposed to damages?

4

MS. CALDWELL:

5

Court is, what was the intent of Congress?

6
7

QUESTION:

We look to the intent of Congress, I

suppose, by looking at the laws that it wrote.

8
9

The central question for this

MS. CALDWELL:

That's right.

And the laws that

it wrote in 1972, there was an intent of Congress to

10

provide additional relief to what had been provided under

11

the 1964 Act, and they added the language, or any other

12

equitable relief as the court deems appropriate, clearly

13

discretionary with the court and therefore equitable, Your

14

Honor.

Do you think a court of equity has

16

ever traditionally awarded damages in the sense of front

pay?

1

that would normally be required of the person, which would

2

be injunctive in nature, is not available for whatever

3

reason, such as the land no longer exists on the market,

4

then relief can be given, which would be equitable, and

5

yet be monetary in nature.

6

QUESTION:

I thought there was a doctrine where

7

contracts for personal services were not specifically

8

enforceable, Longley against Wagner.

9

MS. CALDWELL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But

10

I think there is an analogy in equity, in the maximums of

11

equity, which do lend credence to what Congress created,

12

which was a form of equitable relief involving monetary

13

relief, both back pay and later the court-created remedy

14

of front pay.

15

QUESTION:

When you speak of front pay, do you

16

mean an award calculated as it was in the Chief Justice's

17

hypothetical?

18

term contract, you take the term of the contract, figure

19

out what portion of it is unexpired, and in effect, award

20

pay equal to what would have been earned in that

21

unexpired term --

22

In other words, you take -- if you have a

MS. CALDWELL:

Not at all, Your Honor, and

23

that's one of the central problems of the concept of front

24

pay as a purely legal remedy.

25

QUESTION:

All right.

Well, how, then, is front

pay calculated, because that was going to be my question.

2

I understand it in his hypo, and you didn't take exception

3

to that, but you now say, Well, that isn't the way we

4

calculate it.

5

How is it calculated?

MS. CALDWELL:

Front pay is much more fluid.

6

depends on the circumstances.

7

not whether the person's entitled to front pay.

8

consideration is whether that plaintiff should be

9

reinstated, and is there a compelling reason why they

It

The first consideration is
The first

10

should not be reinstated, and there are numerous examples

11

of circumstances where reinstatement would be

12

inappropriate.

13

For example, there's another employee in the

14

place in which the plaintiff -- to which the plaintiff

15

would be reinstated.

16
17
18

QUESTION:
Assume that.

Okay.

Let's just take that case.

How is front pay going to be calculated?

MS. CALDWELL:

Some courts have fashioned it as,

19

we'll give the company two years to find an appropriate

20

position for this plaintiff, given the training,

21

experience, background.

22

that person will be paid the pay that they otherwise would

23

have missed.

24
25

QUESTION:

And during that two-year period,

All right.

Now, if at the end of the

two-year period, there hasn't been a reinstatement, is

1

there any further front pay ever awarded, or do you say at

2

that point, it's over with and any future award would have

3

to be an award of damages?

4

MS. CALDWELL:

Often it comes right back to the

5

court, and in the Sixth Circuit case of Shore v. Federal

6

Express, which went up on appeal twice to the Sixth

7

Circuit -- and it's one of the leading cases from the

8

Sixth Circuit in which the Sixth Circuit recognizes front

9

pay as equitable -- the plaintiff was held by the judge

10

not to be required to go back to that employment because

11

of the hostile environment, the painful situation she

12

would find herself in.

13

QUESTION:

This is after something like the two-

14

year period has passed?

15

MS. CALDWELL:

Well, what he did was he

16

fashioned the remedy, saying that she would never again

17

find a job equivalent in pay to what she had Federal

18

Express, and each year Federal Express is required to pay

19

her the difference between what she earned and what she

20

would have earned.

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

But that -- I just don't see

22

how when the front pay so-called becomes that extensive, I

23

don't see how you distinguish it from an award of lost

24

future earnings not attributable to loss of earning

25

capacity, which is a recognized form of damages at law.

MS. CALDWELL:

The hallmark really is the

discretion of the court.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Caldwell, you're describing this

4

as the typical substitute for reinstatement, but you did

5

say that front pay covers a wide range, and at least one

6

area that it covers is a person qualifies for the

7

promotion or for the job, doesn't get it because of

8

discrimination.

9

the job isn't there.

10

But then there's a seniority system, so
Front pay is you pay the person at

the job level where they are now until there's a vacancy.

11

Or if there's a training program, she hasn't

12

been promoted but she would need a training program, you

13

pay her while she gets the training program at the higher

14

rate.

15

as an incentive to stop the employer from foot-dragging.

16

And front pay in those situations was conceived of

So you're treating this in the most questionable

17

case where front pay is originally, in the situations I

18

describe, it's much more easy to characterize as

19

equitable.

20

cases where she's never going to be in the job.

21

Is that not so?

MS. CALDWELL:

And you're giving us these

Well, front pay applies to both

22

instances, and normally this is one of the reasons why it

23

should remain with the court rather than with a jury.

24
25

QUESTION:

Ms. Caldwell, would you tell me how

it works so far as the jury's concerned.

pointed out that from your standpoint, there's a real

2

problem with the respondent's position as to what the jury

3

should be instructed, but even if your position is

4

accepted, I'm not quite sure how it works.

5

Is the employer entitled to an instruction to

6

the jury?

7

that there is liability and if you reach the point of

8

punitive damages and future damages, you should not take

9

into account any lost future earnings.

10
11
12

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find

Is that the way it

works, if you prevail?
MS. CALDWELL:

If I prevail, that's not the way

it would work, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

How does it work?

14

MS. CALDWELL:

15

QUESTION:

The way it would work --

Just as -- for the preface, because

16

it would seem to me that the employer would want the jury

17

to know that they shouldn't worry about future pay and

18

future earnings, and there should be some instruction to

19

that effect.

20

MS. CALDWELL:

There should be an instruction to

21

that effect, but there are certain future pecuniary

22

amounts that the jury would be instructed on.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. CALDWELL:

25

And what are those?
And those would be such things as

future medicals, moving expenses, those sorts of items,

1

which are clearly within the confines of what Congress

2

allowed in enacting this legislation.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Caldwell, can I call your

4

attention to the text of the statute again which you cited

5

us to?

6

any other type of relief authorized.

7

currently authorized, not that used to be authorized.

8

isn't one of the problems with your case that, assuming

9

you're relying on the equitable nature of this award, it's

Compensatory damages shall not include back pay or
I assume that means
And

10

clear that you do not give equitable relief where legal

11

relief is available.

12

doesn't cover the problem.

13

Equity only steps in when the law

Now, once upon a time, this front pay may have

14

been available under 2000e-5(g) of the Civil Rights Act as

15

equitable relief, but once you have enacted a new

16

provision for compensatory damages, it seems to me you do

17

not need that equitable relief of front pay.

MS. CALDWELL:

It does not function the same as

20

a sum certain that a jury would find as to future losses.

21

It's a different animal.

22

QUESTION:

Also I believe if you look to --

Well, do you deny that if you have

23

legal ability to get your future earnings, you cannot ask

24

a court of equity to give you your future earnings without

25

jury trial and everything else that goes with it?

MS. CALDWELL:

It would certainly thwart the

intent of Congress to provide make-whole relief.

QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

QUESTION:

What do you call this -- is there a

what's the term that you call these other damages?

Equitable damages?

MS. CALDWELL:

QUESTION:

10
11

No.

And then

Equitable relief.
Equitable relief but not

damages?
MS. CALDWELL:

Well, damages are a portion or a

12

type of equitable relief which have been fashioned and

13

made available under Title VII.

14

QUESTION:

Well, that's just contrary to the

15

most fundamental understanding of the difference between

16

equity and law.

17

other kinds of relief when damages are not sufficient.

18

The law awards damages.

MS. CALDWELL:

Equity awards

And the difficulty here -- and

19

perhaps I'm not expressing it clearly enough -- is that

20

when a court reaches the issue of front pay, the court is

21

normally joining it with some form of injunctive relief

22

that's certainly not within the provenance of a jury.

23

QUESTION:

Well, under the new law as written,

24

you can get compensatory damages.

It used to be, because under your

theory, it was equitable relief, and it was -- and the

10

same money was not available through the law.

But when

11

you have a new statute that says you can get this

12

compensation, I don't see any justification for giving you

13

front pay on an equitable basis.

14

MS. CALDWELL:

We have legislative history which

makes clear that all the persons who expressed any

QUESTION:

You're not looking at me, are you?

18

MS. CALDWELL:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia, I am.

Are you saying, Ms. Caldwell,

20

essentially that front pay is post-judgment back pay, that

21

is, that they are identical animals, and Congress

22

characterized back pay as equitable?

23

MS. CALDWELL:

24

QUESTION:

25

Absolutely.

And front pay, since it is of the

same character, is as much equitable.

I read the statute the way Justice Ginsburg says it.

20

from a statutory reading, I would think the jury shouldn't

award back pay, but I'm pretty sure also that's not the

22

way it works.

I believe it should not work that

way.

the instruction, then there's a calculation by the jury.

2

But that's a different animal from front pay to that

3

extent, because there is a two-step process in front pay.

4

First, the issue of reinstatement entirely for the court.

5

Second, the issue of front pay which is a matter of not

6

straight calculation.

7

QUESTION:

What about someone who has been

8

discriminated against and wants damages but does not want

9

reinstatement?

10

MS. CALDWELL:

If you look at 706(g) itself,

11

that allows an award of back pay and other equitable

12

relief regardless of reinstatement.

13

QUESTION:

So -- but you're saying that the

14

court must always first deal with reinstatement before it

15

gets to back pay or --

16

MS. CALDWELL:

17

QUESTION:

Before it gets to front pay.

To front pay.

But in a situation

18

where the plaintiff, although wronged, does not wish

19

reinstatement, that's not going to be the case.

20

MS. CALDWELL:

The converse is equally

21

difficult.

If this Court decides that front pay is now

22

awardable exclusively under 1981a, the effect will be that

23

persons who were discriminated against but not

24

intentionally will no longer be able to get front pay.

25

That will certainly thwart the make-whole purposes of the

characterization of back pay as equitable, that that was

4

done way back in '64, because there was frankly distrust

5

in how southern juries would deal with Title VII?

6

MS. CALDWELL:

7

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

So Congress created this thing that

8

they call back pay, which one might characterize as

9

compensatory whether it was called back pay, and then the

10

court said, well, front pay is the same, is post-judgment

11

back pay, so the courts put it under the same heading.

12

MS. CALDWELL:

And keep in mind that front pay

13

did not -- that term was not coined until 1977, some five

14

years after the 1972 amendment.

15

QUESTION:

You said in response to an earlier

16

question of Justice Ginsburg that the statute -- or you

17

agreed that the statute characterizes front pay as

18

equitable.

The 1991 statute, where does it do that?

19

MS. CALDWELL:

I didn't mean to say that.

It doesn't call it equitable.

It

doesn't even call back pay equitable.

it wanted to provide additional remedies.

4

said that the new relief was in addition to the relief as

from the new relief, and that's because the whole -- what

was going on is Congress wanted to provide added relief in

that that relief would be subject to a jury determination,

I am terminated before the time for my performance of

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Under the current

rule of a breach of contract, you could, but interestingly

10

enough, if one's looking back for law versus equity and

11

analyze back to the 18th Century, the rule then was that

12

you couldn't get future lost wages as damages for a breach

13

of contract because they were too speculative, so you

14

couldn't get them at law, you couldn't get them in equity

15

then.

16

Congress provided for new remedies of the type

17

that don't have a precise parallel to what was

18

traditionally available at law and equity.

19

QUESTION:

It specifically named back pay.

I

20

mean, it seems to me it doesn't get you very far to say

21

that front pay no more resembles equitable relief or no

22

less resembles equitable relief than does back pay,

23

because Congress mentions back pay in Section 706(g)(1).

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, it does, Your Honor, but it

also mentions back pay as an illustration in a statute

it to award other equitable relief.

There's no right to a jury trial on back pay, just

right to a jury trial on front pay.

As a matter of practice, do juries

ever do back pay?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

To the extent that juries might in

14

some cases do back pay, which I'm not specifically aware

15

of, I would assume that they're doing that in an advisory

16

capacity, which the court is allowed to ask the jury to

do.

with our opinion in Chauffeurs Union?

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that the

A facial reading of the statutory scheme, in

4

fact, shows that compensatory damage and, as we get to it,

one of its component parts, future pecuniary losses, are

subject to decision by the jury.

Now, what I would like to do just briefly is

8

step back and see where the parties agree here and really

where we shouldn't differ.

I listened very closely to

Petitioner this morning, and I thought there was no

12

what front pay is.

13

the court said that front pay is future lost earnings or

wages.

QUESTION:

Historically when you boil it down,

Just as back pay is past loss of

earnings.

That's generally true.

So you can't distinguish the two.

there is agreement between the parties as to what this

in fact, petitioner in her opening brief, on page 14,

11

concedes that, in effect, it is lost future earnings.

from that would be, is isn't it true that if we write

those words on paper, that by writing those words, we will

cast considerable doubt on back pay as well, because it

will suggest that that is a legal remedy and not an

awarded back pay, hadn't it?

MR. RIPPLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And had awarded at least a form of

10

MR. RIPPLE:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

So I don't maybe even need the

12

equitable portion of the statute to find that what this

13

statute seemed to do was to simply suck up what the NLRA

14

had done and spit it out into this new statute, in which

15

case you get back pay and front pay.

16

MR. RIPPLE:

17

QUESTION:

I think that was the intent in '72.

The problem with it is you will have

18

the worst of both worlds, because in which case, there

19

would be front pay, and both front pay and back pay would

20

not be equitable, but would be legal relief, and you'd get

21

a jury trial on both of them.

22

for back pay as well as for --

MR. RIPPLE:

Usually back pay is a practical

24

matter in these cases.

It's relatively manageable, it's

25

understandable, it's calculable and by statute only goes

QUESTION:

Well, if I rely on the National Labor

Relations Act language which was embodied in the original

version of this statute, why don't I reach the same result

that your opponents say should be reached in this case?

9

QUESTION:

I guess I don't understand that
I'm sorry.

The argument is that this constitutes

affirmative action as may be appropriate, whether or not

10

it's equitable relief, because that's all that the

11

National Labor Relations Act language said, and under that

12

language, the NLRA awarded both back pay and front pay.

13

And when Congress adopted that language in this statute,

14

they expected courts to do the same thing.

15

MR. RIPPLE:

I don't know if I've ever seen it

16

construed that way.

don't think I've ever seen it construed.
