ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY WINKELMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MS. WINKELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case involves an excessive force action

11

brought by a State prisoner under Section 1983 that was

12

dismissed on the grounds that the prisoner had not

13

exhausted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's three-tiered

14

prison grievance system.

15

statutory construction, whether when first enacting and

16

then amending Section 1997e(a), to limit the exhaustion

17

provisions to, quote, such administrative remedies as are

18

available.

19

The case turns on an issue of

Congress intended to require a prisoner, whose

20

remedy is one for monetary damages, to address a past-

21

completed constitutional violation to exhaust a prison

22

grievance system that cannot provide such a remedy.

23

course, the backdrop of this case is that there's no

24

general exhaustion requirement in Section 1983.

25

is key here is that when Congress first enacted the

Of

But what

1

Section 1997e exception in 1980 and then when it amended

2

Section 1997e in 1996, while dramatically strengthening

3

and changing the exhaustion provision in many respects, it

4

retained the key words, such administrative remedies as

5

are available.

6

QUESTION:

7

about effective, did they not?

8
9

But they also took out the words

MS. WINKELMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Congress took out the words plain, speedy and effective in

10

1996, along with making exhaustion mandatory rather than

11

discretionary, removing the stay provision and a number of

12

other changes.

13

and effective, though, those words did not drive the

14

result that we're seeking here.

15

inquiry of whether, in fact, the prison grievance system

16

could provide the relief.

17

work that those words did in the prior statute, and this

18

is evident from looking at the present statute, which is

19

reprinted on page 5A of Respondent's brief.

20

The purpose of taking out plain, speedy

QUESTION:

They didn't drive the

What those words -- what the

In this case the statute says, no

21

action.

It doesn't say particular claim for something.

22

It says no action shall be brought until such

23

administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.

24

Your client, I take it, brought an action and in that

25

action, he wanted a transfer of records, a bunch of

1

different things, as well as damages.

2

as this case is concerned, why wasn't there for that

3

action remedies to exhaust, namely all the transfer part,

4

all the other parts?

5

MS. WINKELMAN:

So at least as far

Your Honor, when Mr. Booth

6

brought his claim, it's true that he sought both what we

7

know as injunctive relief and money damages and in fact

8

that was the basis upon which Respondents opposed our

9

petition for writ of certiorari, that this was a mixed

10

case.

But the question that we presented was a money

11

damages only case and that's the question that's before

12

--

13

QUESTION:

Just looking at the statute, the

14

statute, though, and the statute refers to action and this

15

is a mixed action.

16

strong argument that whatever you think about somebody who

17

runs into court and files a claim only for money damages,

18

where a prisoner asks for both, he shouldn't be able to

19

bring his money claim in court until after he's exhausted

20

his prison remedies in respect to what there is to exhaust

21

and there's a lot.

22

And I would think there's a very

23

of Appeals have taken a different approach.

1

the rationale for allowing a person who has the mixed

2

claim to go to Federal court at all, if he doesn't first

3

go and exhaust what he has to exhaust?

4

MS. WINKELMAN:

The Courts of Appeals haven't

5

explained their reasoning in the decisions, but one

6

possibility would be a practical one, which is if in a

7

mixed claim situation the prisoner has to go back and

8

exhaust both the injunctive and the monetary part, it's

9

likely that their monetary claim -- they would risk

10

-- face a high risk of forfeiting their money claim

11

because it would be too late to exhaust that through the

12

prison grievance system.

13

five days.

It's 15 days for bringing your initial

14

grievance.

So if Mr. Booth's case had been dismissed, he

15

would have been out of time, in all likelihood by that

16

point, to pursue the money claim through the grievance

17

procedure, which is why I think the Courts of Appeals had

18

approached the issue and dealt with this problem by

19

permitting --

20

QUESTION:

Pennsylvania's, for example, is

I don't follow that if he hadn't come

21

to court at all.

If the rule is, if you want more than

22

one kind of relief, you must go to the administrator

23

within five days, whatever.

24

Justice Breyer was suggesting, that is if you have a mixed

25

claim, this -- what you're trying to present, you said,

So the idea is, I think what

1

the question we presented is damages only.

You want this

2

Court to treat this case as though there were never any

3

claims, anything else other than money damages and I

4

understand that that's how you would like this case to be

5

treated, but if we take this very case, I am not following

6

your argument that there would be any loss of time and a

7

time bind for the defendant if you must go swiftly to the

8

prison system and name everything.

MS. WINKELMAN:

My argument Justice Ginsburg is

that when he brought his -- he brought his mixed action,

that is true.

12

13

injunctive claims in here that need to be exhausted, he

14

would have been, he would have been time-barred from

15

pursuing the money damages claim then in Federal court

because he had to bring his grievance, under

17

Pennsylvania's grievance procedure, within 15 days of the

incident.

If he had been -- if that action had then

but it is entirely conceivable that an exhaustion

the statute reads.

13

MS. WINKELMAN:

That seems to

Your Honor, if Congress had

14

intended to require exhaustion in every case, a blanket

15

exhaustion rule, it would have and could have written such

a statute, but it didn't do that in 1980 and when Congress

17

had the opportunity in 1996, and I want to go back to the

question about effective because I don't think I answered

that completely.

20

When Congress had the opportunity in 1996 to

21

create this kind of blanket exhaustion, we want all

could have written a broad exhaustion statute.

maybe they can't give damages, but that's the next stage.

It might be --

that the Congress could have taken the FTCA analogy to

2

accomplish the result that it wants to accomplish here.

3

MS. WINKELMAN:

If the result is that all prison

4

complaints and all prison problems are aired through the

5

prison grievance system first, then I submit that Congress

6

could have created that type of statute, but Congress

7

didn't do that.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, I would agree with you that

Congress perhaps could have been clearer about it.

But I

10

want to ask you just a textual question to see whether we

11

disagree on that.

12

at the statute I thought remedies referred to form of

13

relief.

14

statute a few more times, I came to the conclusion that,

15

in fact, remedies was an ambiguous word.

16

mean form of relief or it could mean administrative

17

process.

18

I will admit that when I first looked

But after reading the briefs and reading the

It could either

And one of the textual clues, it seems to me,

19

that's in there to indicate that Congress meant

20

administrative process was its use of the word exhaust.

21

We don't normally speak of exhausting the relief that you

22

get.

23

having a good time, that's what -- I mean, exhaustion

24

usually refers to exhausting a particular process.

25

just at kind of step one, the textual point here seemed to

I mean, like running through the money damages and

So

1

me probably to make a better argument or support a better

2

argument, that what Congress was talking about when it

3

used relief was administrative process rather than -- a

4

remedy rather.

5

than particular relief awarded.

6

that?

7

It was using administrative process rather

MS. WINKELMAN:

Would you comment on

I agree that there's some

8

ambiguity in the word remedy and procedure and it's

9

something certainly that we've struggled with, with the

10

word remedy in the statute, that sometimes it can mean an

11

administrative procedure and sometimes it can mean the

12

right.

13

probably doing double duty in some sense, but when it --

Where we've come out is that in this statute it's

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, if it's doing double duty,

doesn't that nix your case?

16

MS. WINKELMAN:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

17

because it's still an administrative remedy as are

18

available.

19

that can actually give you the right, the relief that you

20

seek, something that can actually redress the wrong.

21

That's the meaning of remedy.

22

QUESTION:

It means both procedure and it means something

One of the practical difficulties of

23

your interpretation is that I gather a prisoner by simply

24

saying he wants money damages in any case can avoid the

grievance system entirely even though money damages might

not be a major part of what he wants.

2

MS. WINKELMAN:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, this

3

problem of bypass, I think, is a little, somewhat

4

overblown in some of the briefs.

5

fact, the empirical evidence would point to the contrary

6

that in the Circuits, in the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits,

7

that have held our away on the money damages point, there

8

hasn't been this bypass and this explosion of litigation

9

and that makes sense because if what the prisoner wants,

It's conjectural.

In

10

the prisoner can, in fact, get through the prison

11

grievance process, then just like the State's amicus brief

12

points out, numerous grievances are resolved in a

prisoner's favor.

14

different cell.

15

Why would they give up the injunctive relief that they

16

want simply to get into Federal court where they have to

today pay a filing fee, at least in installments, where

18

they risk losing one of their three lifelong strikes if,

So --

They would go there.

QUESTION:

Ms. Winkelman, I wanted to get a

clearer handle than I now have on the nature of the claim

23

you think you have.

24

you have this kind of claim, you can go directly to court

25

with no administrative filing at all.

You were candid in saying before, if

Suppose the

1

administrative process does include some kind of monetary

2

relief, but it's got a cap, say a thousand dollars capped.

3

And your client's view is they beat me to a bloody pulp

4

and a thousand dollars wouldn't begin to compensate me for

5

my injury.

6

to court because there's no available remedy?

7

monetary remedy but it's capped.

8
9

Could such a person, in your view, go directly

MS. WINKELMAN:

There's a

Your Honor, in that situation,

Justice Ginsburg, the prisoner would have to go through

10

the prison grievance system because the prison grievance

11

system, while it couldn't provide the one-to-one

12

correlation of the relief could provide the category of

13

relief and certainly our position wouldn't preclude a cap

14

such as the one that you posit your hypothetical.

15

But in that situation there is a monetary

16

damages remedy available.

17

It may not be the one-to-one fit, but the difference

18

between that case and our case, is that in our case there

19

was no monetary damages remedy available at all and that's

20

why Mr. Booth, as a matter of administrative exhaustion,

21

didn't have to go through that process.

22

It may not be a perfect remedy.

In light of these changes, it is clear that

Congress wants prisoners to exhaust their prison

I know I wanted to hear her response, but I'm

MR. PAPPERT:

What it means, Your Honor, is what

Congress wanted and that is that there is a presumption

12

that underlies, I think, the Petitioner's point and your

13

initial question, which is that, just because money's not

14

available there is nothing that this process can do for

15

the prisoner.

16

QUESTION:

Well, his complaint is not money.

17

His complaint is that a guard whacked him over the head or

18

something of that sort.

19

MR. PAPPERT:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the way the statute reads, it

21

says with respect to prison conditions, no action shall be

22

brought with respect to prison conditions until such

23

administrative remedies as are available are exhausted and

24

I gather the condition here is the fact that guards go

25

about whacking people over the head and the remedies for

that are presumably whatever remedies the prison provides

2

for when you get whacked over the head, which might

3

include money damages, but might not.

MR. PAPPERT:

Well, remedy in this statute means

QUESTION:

Congress wanted the inmates to

Even though there's nothing at the

8

end of it?

You mean it's just a process.

we're not going to give you anything but we're going to

have a hearing and then an appeal and then a second

13

Of course, you can't get any relief.

MR. PAPPERT:

No, it doesn't.

Surely it

No, it doesn't,

14

Your Honor.

And where I respectfully differ with your

15

question is again the presumption that it means nothing.

16

The process means nothing if there isn't money at the end

17

of the line and the reason that that is not correct is

18

that there is an indefinite and almost endless list of

19

ways that the prison could satisfy the prisoner, short of

20

money.

21

satisfy the prisoner short of giving him or her money

22

because in essence the currency equivalence isn't money.

Money has a value within the prisons, but the currency of

which took a greater length of time than the statute of

14

MR. PAPPERT:

MR. PAPPERT:

I was honestly trying to get to

11

that, Your Honor, and that is, that that's my point behind

the fact that courts do not lose the discretion here to

that the prisoner's put in the position that Justice

We believe that the prisoner could

that, under the Petitioner's interpretation, we still have

is there's no prohibition on a court recognizing that.

MR. PAPPERT:

In that hypo, even though there

2

could be no action taken against the guard, there could

3

still be something that the prison could give the prisoner

4

that would satisfy him.

5

interpretation of the statute is, we will never know that.

6

We don't know that in this case before the claim gets to

7

Federal courts and we will not know that in all the cases

8

that are similar to this that follow because we never gave

9

the prison the chance to try.

10

QUESTION:

The problem with the Petitioner's

Could you give me an example of this.

My hypothetical is he sues because he was assaulted by a

Congress focused more broadly in this statute and there

at the prison and the prison itself by putting the prison

MR. PAPPERT:

The words are used interchangeably

in the statute and when we do speak of exhaustion of

3

remedies we don't, as I believe Justice Souter pointed

4

out, we don't speak of exhaustion of the money or the

injunctive relief, we speak of exhaustion of the process.

It means a process that provides

relief.

10

MR. PAPPERT:

QUESTION:

Yes.

describing the procedure, says the following relief can be

13

given and they give a bunch of examples, but none of them

14

include the hypothetical you've given me.

suggesting there's sort of an undefined category of relief

that might be granted by the warden independently, not as

Is that what you're

there may be something that can benefit the prison and the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

The PLRA requires an inmate to exhaust available

7

administrative remedies without regard to whether they

8

offer the relief that the inmate seeks in court.

9

So if an

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

On that small point and I don't

21

think it would come up very much because almost often --

22

almost in all cases there would be something that the

23

administrative process could do about the complaint and

24

here we're talking about a complaint about excessive

25

force.

So the available remedies that have to be in

1

existence is just something that addresses complaints

2

about excessive force and it could be transferring the

3

inmate to another area, it could be disciplining the

4

officer involved and directing the officer not to repeat

5

that conduct and that would show that administrative

6

remedies are available and an inmate would have to

7

exhaust, even if he only wants to seek money in court.

8

Now that conclusion follows when the textual

9

changes that Congress made in the statute.

Before the Act

10

was amended, exhaustion could only be required when the

11

available administrative remedies were effective.

12

this Court said in McCarthy against Madigan that

13

administrative remedies are not effective when the inmate

14

seeks only money and the administrative process does not

15

offer that specific form of relief.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And

And it was dictum there, of course.
Of course, it was dictum, but when

18

Congress is reviewing a statute and are attempting to

19

amend it, it's very unlikely that Congress is going to

20

make fine distinctions about whether this Court had a

21

holding or an analysis that was necessary to the holding

22

or that it was dicta.

23

interpretation of the term effective and the Court

24

interpreted it to mean then when administrative remedies

25

do not offer money and the inmate is seeking money, the

What Congress was faced with was an

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

administrative available remedies are not effective and in

2

that context, Congress's elimination of the term effective

3

shows that Congress intended to require inmates to exhaust

4

available remedies in all cases, including ones like that

5

in McCarthy, in which the inmate seeks only money and the

6

available remedies do not offer money.

7

So what we have, what the statue essentially

8

says to an inmate, is if you have a complaint about prison

9

conditions and the administrative process will address it

10

in some way, you must give the administrative process a

11

chance to do it to your satisfaction and if they cannot do

12

that --

13
14

QUESTION:

Your interpretation of the word

remedy is more than process then, it's some relief.

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think it's some relief, but

16

that's what I think is implicit in a grievance procedure.

17

I would just use the word grievance procedure.

18

grievance procedure is something that offers some relief

19

for the kind of complaint that an inmate is complaining

20

about.

21

A

And the reason Congress made the particular

22

changes that it made here is it wanted to reduce the

23

enormous burden that these kinds of cases were placing on

24

Federal district courts and the change that it made

25

accomplishes that in two important ways.
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

First of all, an

1

inmate may start out wanting nothing other than money and

2

he may end up being satisfied with something else.

3

second of all, you have cases where the inmate receives a

4

decision on the merits and he decides after seeing that

5

decision that this is not a claim that's worth pursuing in

6

court.

7

And

And finally, it's important to note that very

8

few State administrative programs offer money for anything

9

other than personal property loss.

So the consequence of

10

accepting the Petitioner's construction here would be that

11

an inmate would have the ability in a wide range of case

12

to avoid the exhaustion requirement simply by formulating

13

a complaint that seeks only money.
