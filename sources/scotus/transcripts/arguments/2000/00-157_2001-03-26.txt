ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC R. FOX

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. FOX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

There is a single element in this case that

12

properly determines its outcome, and that is that the

13

product liability loss, as the district court said, and

14

you can find this on page 36A of Appendix B.

15

liability loss is a subset of the net operating loss.

16

Section 172(a) and 172(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue

17

Code provides that a net operating loss can be carried

18

back three years.

19

The product

Section 172(b)(1)(I), and you can find the exact

20

language on page two of petitioner's brief, provides that

21

in the case of a taxpayer which has a product liability

22

loss, the product liability loss shall be a net operating

23

loss carry-back to each of the ten taxable years preceding

24

the loss year.

25

product liability loss, and that is, it is the lesser of

In Section 172(j)(1) then defines the term

1

the net operating loss for the year, and that is the net

2

operating loss that can otherwise be carried back three

3

years, or the sum of the amounts allowable as product

4

liability deductions.

5

So it is clear that the product liability loss

6

is nothing other than a piece of the net operating loss.

7

And if you apply that rule to a single stand-alone

8

corporation, the first thing you do is determine whether

9

the corporation has a net operating loss.

If it has a net

10

operating loss, the next thing you do is determine the

11

extent to which that net operating loss is attributable to

12

product liability deductions.

13

deductions in an amount not exceeding the net operating

14

loss then becomes the product liability loss.

15

carried back ten years, but it's all part of the net

16

operating loss.

17

And the product liability

That can be

So if you have a product liability loss that's

18

less than the entire net operating loss, then after you

19

carry back the product liability loss ten years, what is

20

left of the net operating loss can be carried back three

21

years.

22

The important part -QUESTION:

Is the theory of the statute that

23

development of these products usually takes longer than a

24

three-year period, and that what we're just trying to do

25

is allow the company to have its loss carry back apply to

1

those years in which it was engaging in research?

2

the theory of the statute, or is there some other theory?

3

MR. FOX:

Is that

I think the legislative history

4

suggests that there was some concern that product

5

liability suits and the like took time to arise, and that

6

a product might be sold in a particular year, generate

7

income, and then it wouldn't be for many years before the

8

product liability suit arose.

9

longer period of income against which potentially large

And in order to provide a

10

losses might be deducted, the Congress thought it was

11

appropriate to extend the statute and allow going back as

12

far as ten years.

13

I think the theory was that it would be logical

14

that the income might arise years earlier than the three-

15

year period, and Congress was simply extending the carry-

16

back period to allow for that problem.

17

QUESTION:

I suppose it doesn't help us much

18

because if I told you, well, that makes it sound very

19

corporation-specific, you would say, well, so are all

20

other net operating losses when they're calculated.

21

the first instance, they're specific to that corporation,

22

and yet they are carried over to affiliated groups, so

23

product liability losses should be given the same

24

treatment.

25

I take it that's your argument.
MR. FOX:

Well -5

QUESTION:

You want to make it a better

MR. FOX:

Well, I'll try, Justice Kennedy, if I

can.
I believe that the plain language of the statute

when applied to an affiliated group of corporations

7

requires the outcome that we seek.

QUESTION:

Would you respond, Mr. Fox, to the

claim that what you're arguing for is a double deduction,

10

and would you tell me in the first instance something that

11

maybe I should have gotten from the briefs, but I just

12

couldn't find it.

13

in this affiliated group which, in fact, as I understand

14

it, had the expenses involved here -- did they deduct the

15

product liability expenses in the course of calculating

16

what in effect turned out to be positive income which was

17

then attributed to the group?

18

aside the treatment -- the possible treatment of the loss,

19

has there already been a deduction taken by the

20

constituent companies here?

21

MR. FOX:

Did the -- did the successful companies

No.

Had they already -- leaving

Justice Souter, I want to make

22

perfectly clear there is absolutely no double deduction in

23

this case, and there was no deduction in computing

24

separate taxable income in the sense that a tax benefit

25

was produced at that point.

There was clearly a

1

subtraction of the product liability deduction in arriving

2

at separate taxable income.
Well,

That is --

3

QUESTION:

then --

4

MR. FOX: -- incontrovertible.

5

QUESTION:

-- why aren't you asking for that

6

same subtraction, as it were, to have the further benefit

7

for the affiliated group?

8
9

MR. FOX:

The reason is that when you -- when a

single corporation or an affiliated group has a net

10

operating loss, the total amount of that loss has not

11

produced any tax benefit because you have had deductions

12

that exceed income, and, yes, you've deducted them in the

13

sense that you subtracted them, but now you come up with a

14

negative number, and that negative number, which is all

15

we're talking about here -- the net operating loss -- that

16

in and of itself does not produce a tax benefit.

17

just -- it's hanging out there until you can carry that

18

negative number to some other year and take a deduction

19

against income in that other year.

20

produces a tax benefit, so we have --

QUESTION:

It's

Then the deduction

What we're arguing about here is

whether you go back three years or ten years.
MR. FOX:

Exactly, Justice Scalia.

That's the

24

only thing we're talking about.

The fact is that the very

same product liability deductions that have been, quote,

deducted, in arriving at separate taxable income are in

the net operating loss that Respondent will agree we can

3

carry back three years.

4

years and take a deduction, there's no double deduction.

5

They would not claim that.

6

because we're going back ten years, there's a double

7

deduction, but that's simply not the case because we're

8

reducing what we can otherwise take back three years.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. FOX:

11

QUESTION:

And if we can carry it back three

They now want to say that

Mr. Fox -All we're doing is -I understand that there's no dispute

12

at all about the amount involved.

As you said, it's just

13

a question of whether it's a three-year carry-back or a

14

ten-year carry-back.

15

that's different from the Intermet case -- the other side

16

of this split -- and that in Intermet, the corporation had

17

sustained the loss that Lynchburg was also a member of the

18

consolidated group in the carry-back year.

19

understand the facts of your case, you -- the deductions

20

of the losses sustained in '83 to '86, and you want to

21

carry it back to '73?

22

sustained the loss were not part of the affiliated group.

23

Why should it be carried back -- why should the affiliated

24

group get this benefit when the companies who sustained

25

the loss were not part of it in those carry-back years?

But there's one feature of your case

But as I

MR. FOX:

The regulations have a mechanism for

2

dealing with corporations that join a group and provide

3

that in the case of a net operating loss, if a member of

4

the group contributes to the net operating loss by itself

5

having a loss, and in the carry-back year, be it three

6

years or ten years earlier, it was not a member of the

7

group, a portion of the overall net operating loss can be

8

allocated to that company and carried to a separate return

9

year outside of the consolidated return.

10

In this case --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FOX:

Can be or must be?
Must be.

In this case there -- the

13

corporations that generated -- the members of the group

14

that generated the product liability deductions would not

15

have an allocated net operating loss under that provision

16

of the regulations which is -79.

17

mechanism for carrying back to any separate return year.

18

The only carry-back can be within the group.

19

And so there is no

Now, if you have a corporation that joins a

20

group and has deductions, even though it just joined the

21

group, any deductions it has are going to find its way

22

into the net operating loss that can be carried back.

23

the question again is the fact that the corporation would

24

have deductions, even though it had separate taxable

25

income.

The fact that it is contributing to the net

So

1

operating loss, even though it wasn't a member, say, the

2

last year, does not prevent its deductions from being

3

carried back three years as part of the net operating

4

loss.

5

they're going to be carried back ten years instead of

6

three years.

And so in this case, it's merely a fact that

7
8

QUESTION:

You say the same problem exists under

the three-year carry-back?

9

MR. FOX:

Exactly, because any deductions that

10

this corporation has for product liability are going to

11

find their way into the net operating loss that can be

12

carried back three years, and that would be before it was

13

a member of the group.

14

QUESTION:

Is this right -- and tell me, if it's

15

wrong, I'm not going to pursue it -- but it seems to me

16

the theory of this thing is that we have a company called

17

Company A, and Company A has, let's say, a loss of two

18

dollars over the year.

19

says is wait -- Company A, if you have some product

20

liability loss, there are a lot of things that can cause

21

losses, and you have all of them.

22

23

there is product liability loss.

pretend that's what the statute says -- as long as there

25

was two dollars of it.

And what this statute normally

It was a terrible

1

other loss.

2

Now, what you want to do is if Company A is part

3

of, let's say, fifteen other companies, you want to

4

pretend that the big losses run by these other companies

5

which had nothing to do with product liability are product

6

liability losses, too.

7

9
10

MR. FOX:

Well, I would agree with you, but I

think -QUESTION:

Is that what you -- that's what

you're reading in the statute --

11

MR. FOX:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
All right.

Now, if that's so, then

13

there's a great thing we could do.

14

losses in our company, so we look around for some other

15

firms that happen to have some product liability losses,

16

but they're just marginally profitable.

17

up, and now our let's pretend game allows us to count as

18

our losses which came from totally other things -- having

19

a very bad product, for example -- now are product

20

liability losses, so we get to go back ten years.

21

that would be a consequence of accepting your position, is

22

that right?

23

MR. FOX:

We have some big

Now we buy them

Now,

Theoretically, yes, Justice Breyer,

but I think that is a -- that the example which comes from

perfectly, number one.

you have just posited is not something that flows from the

can exist if a single stand-alone corporation were to find

QUESTION:

Well -Can't you purchase somebody with

losses that will enable you to carry back what you

19

otherwise wouldn't be able to carry back three years?

MR. FOX:

QUESTION:

22
23

That may not -No, but then you're purchasing

somebody with profits in Justice Breyer's example.
MR. FOX:

Might not work that way because if,

24

first of all, if they were separately profitable, then

25

they wouldn't be contributing any losses.

Of course, if

they had losses, then they'd have to carry them back to a

this hypothetical requires coincidences that are very

MR. FOX:

QUESTION:

MR. FOX:

They could promulgate a regulation

12

that would be consistent with this statute but their

13

position, given the regulations as they exist today, is

14

inconsistent with the statute, and I will tell you why.

15

The reason for that is, as I said earlier, the net -- the

16

product liability loss is just a piece of the net

17

operating loss, and an affiliated group filing a

18

consolidated return has only one net operating loss -- the

19

consolidated operating loss.

20

exists to be carried back three years.

21

That's the only thing that

Now, just as you would in the case of the

22

separate corporation, you say, to what extent is that

24

had prescribed that can be carried back three years?

To

deductions?

of the product liability deductions of the group.

3

right in there and every one of those deductions,

4

regardless of whether the contributing member has negative

5

taxable income or positive taxable income, goes right to

6

that bottom line, and you can prove, dollar for dollar,

7

that the net operating loss is attributable to every one

8

of those deductions.

9

And you can determine that by looking at all
It's

And that, because of the way they have designed

10

the regulations, they have provided only for the single

consolidated net operating loss.

13

carried back ten years.

14

that fact.

15

do it on a consolidated basis.

16

worry about whether we should view, in this particular

17

case, the consolidated group as a single entity or as a

18

group of separate companies.

QUESTION:

That is what could be

Mr. Fox, did the Government take the

20

same position in the court of appeals that it takes here?

21

I thought it argued for something a bit different from

22

what the court of appeals came up with.

23

MR. FOX:

I'm a little confused as to what

24

position the Government is taking in this case, but in the

25

court of appeals they basically argued that the net

1

operating loss you should look at was the negative or

2

positive separate taxable income of a company.

3

you had positive taxable income, then the member didn't

4

have a net operating loss and that was the end of the

5

matter.

6

That if

The Fourth Circuit rejected that argument.

The

7

Fourth Circuit said, as the Petitioner argued, that the

8

definition of separate taxable income is not the same as

9

the definition of a net operating loss because separate

10

taxable income excludes things like charitable

11

contributions, capital gains and the like.

12

negative taxable income can never equate theoretically,

13

and definitionally, with a net operating loss.

14
15

And so the Fourth Circuit went and found a net
operating loss some place else.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FOX:

18
19

And so

Where did they find it, Mr. Fox?

that argument had been raised by the Government, but I do

not recall them arguing it specifically in the Fourth

QUESTION:

in terms of anomalies that would be created if you lost?

16

MR. FOX:

All right,

Well, I think from a policy standpoint

17

if you go back and look at the 1918 legislative history,

18

that certainly when Congress brought the consolidated

19

return into being, they thought of the affiliated group as

20

one single business.

contrary to what Congress thought.

1

They thought that all of the activity -- business activity

2

under common ownership, was a single business.

3

But even then you could have an affiliated group

4

of five thousand coffee shops, or five thousand vitamin

5

stores, all managed by a separate headquarters business

6

-- all financed out of one separate headquarters business.

7

I think it's pretty hard there to view each separately

8

incorporated coffee shop as a business that's separate and

9

apart from every other business.

And in that case, it

10

would make perfectly sense -- perfect sense if one member

11

of the group had a product liability loss, even though it

12

might otherwise be profitable, that this entire group

13

which is all in the identical line of business should be

14

able to avail itself of that.

15

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question, Mr. Fox?

16

Going back to your response to Justice Kennedy about the

17

purpose of the provision -- what about the fact that if

18

you do have separate corporations in different lines of

19

business and one of them is profitable notwithstanding its

20

history of product liability losses ten years ago, hasn't

21

that served the purpose of allowing that business entity

22

to recover the loss that has to be otherwise carried back

23

ten years?

24
25

MR. FOX:

If that corporation were a stand-

alone corporation, I would say yes it is.

But I think

1

when you're dealing with an affiliated group, that puts

2

too much emphasis on where you place the particular

3

business.

4

this was a problem, could get around that by simply moving

5

loss companies around.

6

put it where you're going to have the product liability

deductions, you probably could straighten that problem

out.

QUESTION:

You're kind of risking your

But Mr. Fox, isn't that the point of

the Government's -- the note it makes on page 41?

The

5

footnote in which it says there's no logical reason why

6

Petitioner should be able to use these deductions to

7

create product liability losses for itself simply because

8

the affiliated corporations that actually incurred the

9

product liability expenses realized profits instead of

10

losses.

11

doesn't cover the profit for a corporation, but it would

12

cover one where there had been losses.

13

The anomaly that -- as you said, the regulation

MR. FOX:

Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, that

14

that is not really a function of consolidated returns.

15

Take a single stand-alone corporation that has an oil

16

business and a computer business.

17

product liability in the oil business, but when they

18

report their income, they are reporting the entire

19

company's income and losses.

20

the oil business with a product liability deduction and a

21

huge loss in the computer business, they put that all

22

together and, even though the oil business was profitable

23

and the product liability was more than offset by the oil

24

company's income, because they are in a separate

25

corporation, they can put everything together and they're

going to get the product liability deduction.

2

So the fact that you have disparate lines of

3

business is not the thing that causes the problem, because

4

you can get exactly the same result when you're dealing

5

with a stand-alone corporation. And if that's not a

6

problem there, I don't really see why it should be a

7

problem in the affiliated group context.

8
9

QUESTION:

Is your underlying rationale -- and

Justice Breyer asked you about policy questions --that

10

there's really no reason to treat this affiliated group

11

any differently than you would treat one corporation that

12

had separate divisions?

13

MR. FOX:

Yes, I think that is exactly the case.

14

That's the way Congress viewed an affiliated group if you

15

look at that 1918 legislative history.

16

that at some length.

17

ultimate point here is that the plain language of this

18

statute requires that you look at the consolidated net

19

operating loss -- that's the only thing we have that's a

20

net operating loss, and you ask, to what extent is that

21

net operating loss attributable to product liability

22

deductions.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it's common ground that none of the

5

corporations involved in this case would be able to claim

6

a product liability loss on a separate return.

7

because the product liability loss provisions provide no

8

extended carry-back benefits either for profitable

9

corporations regardless of the amount of their product

That's

10

liability expenses, or for unprofitable corporations that

11

have no such expenses.

12

in this case is whether the fact that this profitable

13

entity that had some expenses of this type is combined

14

with an unprofitable entity that had no such expenses

15

changes the result on a consolidated return.

16

QUESTION:

So the narrow question presented

Mr. Jones, can I just ask one

17

preliminary question?

The statute refers to in the case

18

of a taxpayer which has a product liability loss -- now,

19

who is the taxpayer?

MR. JONES:

Well, the taxpayer in the 172

context is plainly the individual corporation.

Mr. Jones, your position that you're

One is, going

into this whole picture with this company, there was an

to go up higher in the Service who said, yeah, they're

right, under the consolidated regs that now exist, they

get this refund.

Therefore, it leads me to think that there has been no

that right?

It is a very important provision,

of the individual entities are defined both in the

regulations --

13

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't that the point?

they don't define it as net operating loss?

is -- at least at the verbal level, there is no such

There is no question that the

What the Secretary instead has done is he has a

workable rule.

It has the background rule that determines

Mr. Jones, there is

The Internal Revenue Code doesn't prevent that.
MR. JONES:

But the question is whether the

the Court said that the mind rebels against the notion

that in allowing for consolidated returns Congress meant

then when the deductions come up ten years later because

the expenses come up later, it's fair to let that company

It is not fair, and it's not what Congress

provided, to let some other company that had no product

This Court said in Woolford Realty that this sort of

said that the privilege of filing a consolidated return is

acquisition, and the question was, well, do you combine

9

these two, or do you look at their separate character?

And the affiliate used that money to buy the

Now, there's a limitation on the amount of

And the answer of the tax court in H Enterprises was, no,

11

you have to look at them as separate individuals and apply

12

that provision separately first.

13

the result was that, well, you didn't hold the interest

14

-- the company that borrowed the money subject to this

15

limitation of using that, that when the other company used

16

the money to buy stock.

17

Now, another -- and so

The other example is -- is the First Chicago

can only do that if it holds a certain percentage of the

amount, and another affiliate owned less than that amount,

amount. But because you local -- you focus your inquiry

Mr. Fox, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC R. FOX

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. FOX:

The Respondent takes the position that

7

if the regulations do not address a particular provision,

8

that any provision in the Code has to be applied on a

9

separate company basis and not on a consolidated basis.

10

That is totally inconsistent with the position that the

11

Internal Revenue Service took in both Gottesman and H

12

Enterprises.

13

In the Gottesman case, the IRS argued that the

14

accumulated earnings tax had to be applied on a single-

15

entity basis.

16

was their position.

17

They happened to lose that case, but that

In H Enterprises, they took the position that

18

the disallowance of interest rule had to be applied on a

19

consolidated basis, and they won the case.

20

in that case was the taxpayer argued that they had

21

borrowing in one company, and the tax exempt bonds in

22

another company, and that you shouldn't look at the two

23

together.

24

you look at the whole thing as one, and there was no

25

regulation that said that.

What happened

But H Enterprises is -- clearly provides that

1

The other point I want to make is that the

2

Government seems to think that you can kind of have a --

3

it's not very important as to how close the definition of

4

separate taxable income may come to net operating loss. I

5

think that is, in a sense, totally irrelevant because the

6

statute says, you look at the net operating loss. The

7

regulations have provided for a net operating loss.

8

the consolidated net operating loss.

9

it would even look at separate taxable income.

10

It's

I see no reason why

The question is, we have the regulations

11

provision for the separate net operating loss, and the

12

issue is, to what degree does that net operating loss that

13

everyone agrees can be carried back three years -- to what

14

extent is it attributable to product liability deductions?

15

When we come up with the number, that's the product

16

liability loss.

17

don't need a regulation to tell you to get there, because

18

the statute is clear on its face, and the Service has put

19

in the regulation the definition of net operating loss.

And that's the end of the matter, and you

20

Thank you.
