CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

99-1702, the State of Texas, Petitioner, v. Raymond Levi

5

Cobb.

6

I have misplaced my -- here we go.

Mr. Coleman.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before Raymond Cobb confessed to murdering

12

Maggie and Korie Rae Owens, he was more than once

13

meticulously informed of his right to counsel and the

14

consequences of his choice to waive that right.

15

confession was properly admitted at trial and should

16

have been rejected under Jackson, because Sixth Amendment

17

right to counsel had never attached to the murders and

18

therefore did not need to be waived, or, alternatively,

19

because Cobb validly waived whatever Sixth Amendment right

20

to counsel had attached.

21

His
not

Applying McNeil's rule of offense specificity to

22

exclude factually related but uncharged crimes from the

23

scope of Sixth Amendment attachment is true to and, we

24

think, required by both the text and the purposes of the

25

Sixth Amendment.
3

1

In evaluating attachment, the court is

2

interpreting the Sixth Amendment terms, criminal

3

prosecutions and the accused, and for decades this Court

4

has consistently interpreted that text to limit attachment

5

of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the formal

6

initiation of judicial criminal proceedings.

7

setting aside Escobido --

8

QUESTION:

Indeed,

Mr. Coleman, do I understand from

9

what you just said that if everything had occurred in

10

Walker County, if there had been no moving of Cobb to

11

Odessa, no bail, everything happens in Walker County, and

12

it really is a point that you represent Cobb, the Walker

13

County law enforcement personnel never consult Ridley

14

before interrogating Cobb repeatedly, it would still be,

15

in your view, no violation of any Sixth Amendment right;

16

is that correct?

17

MR. COLEMAN:

The fact that the interrogation

18

occurred in Odessa makes no difference, you're exactly

19

right.

20

had not yet been appointed on the murders because there

21

had been no indictment, the police were free to

22

interrogate Mr. Cobb.

23

If Ridley had been appointed on the burglary and

QUESTION:

So what the police did was something

24

they didn't need to do.

In other words, the police did

25

twice call Ridley while he, while Cobb was still in Walker
4

1

County.

2

MR. COLEMAN:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Twice called him and said, is it okay

4

if we question your client, and Ridley said yes both

5

times, but that was something extra the police did they

6

were not required to do, in your view?

7

MR. COLEMAN:

That's correct.

8

that they were obligated to do it.

9

they called.

I don't think

I don't think that

I think the record indicated that, in fact,

10

he was in court with Ridley when they asked if they could

11

talk, and so he was there.

12

QUESTION:

But in any event, they did tell him,

13

we're going to talk to your client, is it okay, and he

14

said yes?

15

MR. COLEMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Taking Justice Ginsburg's question a

17

little bit further, suppose you have this situation:

the

18

counsel is there, they begin questioning him on the

19

break-in.

20

you outside a minute, and they go outside of the

21

interrogation room and they say, counsel, you know, we're

22

not interested in the stereo, we're interested in the

23

murder.

24

not representing him on that, go back in the room, ask him

25

all the questions you want?

The police then say, counsel, we'd like to see

Could a responsible attorney say, oh, well, I'm

I would be amazed if an
5

1
2

attorney could do that.
MR. COLEMAN:

I don't know if it would be a

3

responsible thing to do, but the Court made clear in Davis

4

that until there's been an initiation of criminal

5

proceedings the Sixth Amendment constitutional right to

6

counsel doesn't attach, so it would be poor practice,

7

perhaps malpractice, but not a Sixth Amendment violation.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, a number of courts have come to

the conclusion that where the two crimes arise out of the

10

same conduct and are closely related, that you're going to

11

go ahead and apply the Sixth Amendment requirement to the

12

related but yet-uncharged crime.

13

view of lower courts today?

14

MR. COLEMAN:

Is that the majority

I don't think that courts have

15

established any kind of consistent test, but yes, most of

16

the courts that have addressed this issue have said there

17

is this test, although most of them have found that there

18

is, in fact, no violation.

19

number that have found a violation.

20

It's a relatively small

But we would go back and say that they're

21

erroneous in applying that test at all, and as I was

22

saying, Escobido aside, this Court has never, ever held

23

that the Sixth Amendment attached prior to the initiation

24

of formal judicial proceedings, prior to indictment or

25

arraignment.
6

1

QUESTION:

Well, under the hypothetical we were

2

just discussing and the answer you gave to Justice

3

O'Connor, I suppose the police could say, and we're now

4

going to question him about that murder so we want you out

5

of the room.

6

You can't go back in that room.

MR. COLEMAN:

Under Moran that might be

7

constitutionally permissible, but remember, the important

8

aspect of the analysis is what happens in the room,

9

because the defendant does have a Fifth Amendment right to

10

counsel that he needs to be informed about, and he has an

11

opportunity to waive that, so that would only happen if

12

the defendant or suspect has actually waived his Fifth

13

Amendment right to counsel.

14

QUESTION:

That's true.

What I'm concerned

15

about is the possibility for some manipulation, if the

16

police hold and charge on the lesser offense merely to

17

bide their time until they begin questioning about the

18

more serious offense.

19

MR. COLEMAN:

I'm actually very anxious, Justice

20

Kennedy, to debunk this idea of abuse or manipulation,

21

because when the police are doing an investigation, and

22

they might be investigating a number of related crimes,

23

once they have enough evidence to convict, admissible

24

evidence to convict on one of them, there's certainly no

25

problem with them bringing that charge.
7

1

They have a serious societal interest in

2

continuing to investigate other crimes, but if you compare

3

that defendant who has had one crime charged against the

4

defendant where they haven't brought any of the charges,

5

once you charge that defendant he has the right to counsel

6

that has now attached not only to the Fifth Amendment but

7

also the Sixth Amendment, and our system ensures that that

8

person will not only have a right to counsel but will

9

relatively quickly actually be represented by counsel, who

10

will then, of course, advise the client as to the charged

11

offense and almost certainly as to the uncharged offenses

12

and will say, don't talk to the police about this charged

13

offense or anything else and, in fact, Mr. Ridley had

14

given that counsel to Mr. Cobb.

15

it.

But I don't think --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. COLEMAN:

18

He simply didn't follow

Well, that -- that isn't the --- there's a real serious risk of

manipulation.

19

QUESTION:

As I understand it, that isn't the

20

advice that he gave him.

21

I know of that he gave him any advice that he should not

22

talk to the police about anything else.

23

to the police sure, go ahead and talk with him about the

24

murder.

25

MR. COLEMAN:

He -- there's no indication that

He in fact said

In September 1995 -8

1
2

QUESTION:

Is -- just as a matter of fact, isn't

that correct?

3

MR. COLEMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes.

Okay.
On two occasions he told the

6

police to go ahead and talk to them.

7

when Cobb was returning to Odessa, Ridley said, here's my

8

card and my number. If the police try to contact you, call

9

me.

10

QUESTION:

In September 1995,

Well, the obvious problem is the

11

person is accused, or the police think he kidnapped,

12

murdered and raped a person, or they think he distributed

13

drugs, you know, and my first example could involve three

14

separate crimes, my second example could involve

15

possession, a telephone count, a distribution count, and

16

if there was more than one person a conspiracy, all right?

17

So the police indict the person for one of those four, or

18

two of them, and he gets a lawyer, and the next minute

19

they turn around and start asking him questions.

They

20

say, oh, we were asking him about the other two.

It's all

21

the same event.

22

So I mean, what could a Constitution mean that

23

creates that situation?

24

decided that it doesn't mean that.

25

MR. COLEMAN:

That's why every court has

Not every court, Justice Breyer.
9

1

QUESTION:

Well, I mean most.

2

MR. COLEMAN:

3

QUESTION:

But that --

What's the answer?

I mean, that -- I

4

think my problem is what has led almost all the courts to

5

adopt this fuzzier test, and what is the response to that

6

rather direct problem?

7

MR. COLEMAN:

I think if you can establish

8

trickery then you create a Fifth Amendment issue, because

9

it is the Fifth Amendment and not the Sixth Amendment that

10

goes primarily to the issue of coercion.

11

QUESTION:

It won't be trickery.

If the rule is

12

you cannot -- you know, the counsel relates only to the

13

offense charged, there's no trick involved.

14

in total good faith, go and ask the same set of questions

15

relating to the kidnapping without telling the counsel.

16

There's no trick, and that seems not a trick, it seems

17

absurd.

18

MR. COLEMAN:

The police,

I don't believe that it is.

I

19

believe that the police have a strong societal interest in

20

continuing to investigate crimes that have not yet been

21

solved, just as the police were trying to solve two

22

murders in this case.

23

evidence, and I don't think that the Constitution,

24

particularly the Sixth Amendment, prevents the police from

And the lower courts have all agreed

They've all agreed with you, if it's actually a

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't believe that the fact that

5

there is a factual connection between the crimes makes any

6

constitutional difference, distinction.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't McNeil say that it's

offense-specific?
MR. COLEMAN:

McNeil specifically does say that

10

it's offense-specific and that should be interpreted, as I

11

was arguing, to exclude factually related crimes, because

12

factually related crimes are in no better position to

13

receive those kinds of constitutional protections that the

14

Sixth Amendment gives than are unrelated crimes.

15

This Court has said that the purpose of the

16

Sixth Amendment is to protect the unaided layman at

17

critical confrontations with his expert adversary, the

18

Government, after the adverse positions of the Government

19

and the defendant have solidified with respect to a

20

particular alleged crime.

21

There are three parts of that statement that

22

this Court has given in several cases that can't be

23

satisfied by a factually related crime.

24

particular alleged crime doesn't meet it.

25

that there's a solidification of the adverse positions
11

Certainly the
We don't think

1

2

stili investigating a related crime.

3

the defendant did it or not.

4

won't have sufficient evidence to bring that charge,

5

certainly there was not sufficient evidence in this case,

6

and so there's no solidification, and there is not a

7

critical confrontation, which has been defined to be a

8

critical stage, which is a very well-established part of

9

this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.

10
11

The police are

They don't know if

Generally speaking they

There's

simply no critical stage because it is pre-indictment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coleman, would it make any

12

difference to you if the other crime about which he's

13

being interrogated is not only factually related but,

14

under the Blockburger test, would be a greater offense of

15

which the offense on which he's indicted is a lesser-

16

included offense?

17

burglary charge, and he's interrogated concerning the

18

offense of murder in the course of burglary.

19

That is to say, he has an attorney on a

MR. COLEMAN:

We have argued, and it is our

20

position, that if it is not simply a factually related

21

crime, but the argument is that it is the same crime, then

22

we think that there's a strong argument the Sixth

23

Amendment would, in fact --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it's not quite the same crime,

but if he got acquitted on the burglary he'd have to be
12

1

acquitted on murder in the course of burglary.

I mean,

2

Blockburger would cover it and it would be double

3

jeopardy.

4

interrogated without consulting his lawyer concerning

5

murder in the course of burglary?

6

MR. COLEMAN:

So in that case you'd say he could not be

We would say that this Court's

7

rule would prohibit the introduction of evidence relating

8

to that interrogation.

9

QUESTION:

Why?

Now, why is that, because it

10

satisfies the, or doesn't satisfy the Blockburger test?

11

That's quite a burden to put on a police officer.

12

we have a hard enough time applying that test ourselves,

13

and to say that the police officer would be responsible

14

for a Blockburger analysis really is quite demanding.

15

MR. COLEMAN:

I mean,

We think that the Court recognized

16

in Moulton that when the police interrogate suspects

17

they're frequently trying to get evidence about any number

18

of crimes, and one of those might be a previously charged

19

crime, and that is why the Court has very consistently

20

said that the remedy we're going to impose is simply that

21

if you get evidence as to a charged crime for which the

22

Sixth Amendment has attached and been asserted, then we

23

will not allow you admitted at trial but if you have

24

evidence related to other, uncharged crimes, and we would

25

say also factually related uncharged crimes, then you may
13

1

admit it.

2

So it's not the police that are really having to

3

make a hard determination at the time that they do the

4

interrogation.

5

introduce the evidence at trial.

6

That is made later, when you try to

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's become even

7

harder.

I assume the police officer ought to know that if

8

he has a constitutional right to interrogate or not, and

9

you say well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't, depending

10

on what the defendant says.

11

that insufficient guidance to the police.

12

MR. COLEMAN:

That -- we've never given

Well, Clanky is the only case we

13

think in which there was actually the same offense, and we

14

think that if the police are still investigating, or they

15

believe --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

What was the name of the case you

said, Clanky?
MR. COLEMAN:

Clanky v. Illinois.

I'm sorry.

19

It's an Illinois Supreme Court case applying the factual

20

relation test.

21

The police are still investigating other crimes

22

for which no charge has been made.

23

have at that point -- and that's all they need to know.

24

They can then interrogate the suspect, give them their

25

Fifth Amendment rights, and do what they can to protect
14

We think that they

1

those, and then if they end up getting information about a

2

charge that has been -- a crime that has been charged and

3

for which the Sixth Amendment has both attached and been

4

asserted, then they can't use it at trial, but they can

5

use it, under Moulton and under this Court's precedents,

6

for any uncharged crime, a crime for which the Sixth

7

Amendment had not yet attached at the time of the

8

interrogation.

9

But what respondent would have the court do is

10

make the court, make the police apply a test that asks the

11

police to know ahead of time if the crime for which they

12

are going to interrogate the suspect relates to something

13

that the suspect has previously been charged, or with

14

respect to something that the suspect and his counsel may

15

feel that there is an attorney-client relationship, and we

16

don't think that that can be the test.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Coleman, there are -- there's

18

quite a range.

19

the uncharged offenses were wholly unrelated, different

20

time, different place, and here you have one continuous

21

episode.

22

correctly, think that if there is a close relationship

23

between the offenses, if they're all part of one series of

24

events, that the Sixth Amendment right would attach?

25

There's one, the McNeil case itself, where

Don't most courts, if I understand them

MR. COLEMAN:

The fact that there is a close
15

1

relationship cannot overcome the fact that that closely

2

related crime cannot fit within the stated purposes of the

3

Sixth Amendment, and the fact that it would improperly and

4

unnaturally hamstring the police's legitimate efforts to

5

investigate and solve a crime for which no one has been

6

brought to justice.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Coleman, as I understand your

8

argument on why the permissibility of this kind of

9

interrogation for related offenses is not likely to cut

10

back, in effect, on the Sixth Amendment right which has

11

attached, your best argument seems to be that you don't

12

have to recognize a Sixth Amendment right here because

13

there's going to be, as there was in this case, an

14

adequate warning that one doesn't have to speak, and an

15

adequate Fifth Amendment opportunity to get a lawyer,

16

probably the same one, but in any case to get a lawyer

17

prior to the commencement or continuation of any

18

interrogation.

19

Do you agree that's probably your strongest

20

response to the concerns expressed by people like Justice

21

Breyer?

22

MR. COLEMAN:

I believe so, and I believe that's

23

exactly what the Court said in Patterson when it

24

indicated --

25

QUESTION:

Right.
16

1

MR. COLEMAN:

-- that the reason to have counsel

2

at a custodial interrogation for Sixth Amendment purposes

3

is not any stronger than it is for Fifth Amendment, and

4

the Fifth Amendment --

5

QUESTION:

What about --

6

MR. COLEMAN:

7

QUESTION:

-- test protects them.

I'm sorry.

What about, then, the

8

concern for noncustodial interrogations?

If the person

9

who has been charged with the first offense is out on

10

bail, and the police want to go and interrogate, simply

11

see if they can strike up a conversation with a guy at his

12

apartment, we're not going to get -- I presume we're not

13

going to get into any Miranda rights.

14

Isn't the opportunity for abuse there, so that

15

on your best argument, if the police are subtle about what

16

they do, and they have a defendant who's not in custody,

17

they will, in fact, raise the, I think the specter of

18

cutting back on the Sixth Amendment right with respect to

19

the crime that has already been charged.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

The Court in Patterson made it

21

clear that, as to the charged offense for which the Sixth

22

Amendment has attached, there must be an express waiver,

23

so that is why --

24
25

QUESTION:

So that there would be an exclusion

if anything were said about that offense?
17

1

MR. COLEMAN:

If there was no valid waiver for

2

the charged offense.

3

Court's decision in Patterson and Moulton.

4
5

QUESTION:

I think that's the meaning of this

And that would be enforceable by the

exclusionary rule?

6

MR. COLEMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. COLEMAN:

9

Yes.

Okay.
If I may, I'd reserve the rest of

my time for rebuttal.

10

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Coleman.

11

Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

15
16
17

MS. BLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Police have a compelling interest in

18

investigating uncharged crimes and in obtaining voluntary

19

confessions from suspects who have been advised of their

20

right to counsel under Miranda and are willing to speak to

21

the police about those uncharged crimes.

22

does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel

23

because that right is offense-specific.

24
25

That questioning

Under that rule, the statements may not be used
to prove the charged offense, but the statements are
18

1

admissible in a trial for the uncharged offenses.

2

not matter, under this rule, whether the two crimes are

3

factually related.

4

crimes constitute the same offense.

5

It does

QUESTION:

The test is rather whether the two

Why?

Why?

I mean, you see my

6

problem from what I said before, don't you?

7

is ambiguous as to whether you're describing a set of

8

events in the world, or a legal concept.

9

I mean, crime

Look at the set of events in the world.

It

10

would have all been over in 15 seconds, and it could

11

constitute any one of 15 crimes, and the police charge on

12

the basis of that 15 seconds of real-world behavior three

13

crimes, and he gets a lawyer for those three.

14

the police be able, without a lawyer, to interrogate him

15

about what happened in the real world because there are

16

eight other things that weren't charged?

17

MS. BLATT:

Why should

Because the Sixth Amendment, the

18

text of the Sixth Amendment only applies to someone who

19

has been accused in a pending prosecution, and the

20

prosecution is limited by the actual offenses that are

21

charged by the State, and it is only at that time that the

22

right to counsel attaches under the Sixth Amendment.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So it's purely formal.

Your argument

is purely formal.
MS. BLATT:

No.

This Court has repeatedly
19

1

recognized that the requirement that there must be a shift

2

from investigation to accusation is more than just a

3

formalism, because the purpose and the essence of the

4

Sixth Amendment is to make sure the defendant has an

5

opportunity to consult with counsel and prepare for a

6

defense against the pending charges.

7

A suspect has no Sixth Amendment right to

8

counsel, to have a lawyer appointed or assist him in

9

connection with charges that have not been brought by the

10

State, that may never be brought by the State.

11

suspect has never indicated any unwillingness to talk to

12

the police about those uncharged offenses.

13

QUESTION:

The

Ms. Blatt, you gave the example, or I

14

think your brief indicates that you would support the

15

example that if the crime for which the person is already

16

charged is burglary, and they can't ask him about the

17

homicide at the time of burglary because that would be a

18

greater -- that would be the same crime, yes, in that

19

legal sense that we understand for double jeopardy

20

purposes.

21

But this has got to be administered by police

22

officers, and a police officer will say gee, homicide is a

23

lot different from burglary.

24

okay and when it isn't.

25

MS. BLATT:

I don't understand when it's

The same elements test under
20

1

Blockburger leads to consistent and predictable results,

2

and can be ascertained ahead of time by the police

3

officer, and if he needs to consult with the prosecutor,

4

he can do that.

5

By contrast, pegging the Sixth Amendment right

6

to a transaction test leaves police officers in the

7

untenable position of not knowing before they question the

8

suspect what --

9

QUESTION:

Well, I would think the lay person

10

would understand, it all happened in the same episode,

11

more readily than would understand Blockburger.

12

MS. BLATT:

He may not know that.

It may be

13

that they know that there's been a burglary and that there

14

are missing bodies, but have no idea whether those victims

15

were murdered by someone else 2 weeks from then, whether

16

there had been a kidnapping, whether it was in a different

17

location.

18

I mean, he can't possibly know ahead of time,

19

without talking to the suspect, nor can a court ask at the

20

time of appointment of counsel, would you mind telling me

21

everything you did as part of the same transaction so I

22

can make sure you're appointed counsel with respect to all

23

possible offenses that may be brought against you.

24

just -- they don't know that.

25

investigation, and this case is a perfect illustration of
21

They

They're in a phase of

1
2

that.
There's no contention in this case the State

3

manipulated the charges when they indicted him for

4

burglary and 15 months later questioned him about the

5

murder, nor is there any suggestion that they had enough

6

proof at the time that they charged him with burglary to

7

charge him with murder, and there's a hypothetical

8

assertion that there might be incentives for selective

9

manipulation, but we don't believe that those incentives

10
11

necessarily exist.
Once the State initiates a prosecution, the

12

suspect will not only be afforded the right to counsel,

13

but at the time that he's approached, if he's in custody,

14

he will be given his Fifth Amendment Miranda warnings and,

15

under this Court's decision in --

16

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

It seems to

17

me it's not the question of when the lawyer was appointed,

18

but what is the scope of the representation by the lawyer

19

who has been appointed.

20

Assume a lawyer is paid $20 an hour by the State

21

for representing a defendant.

22

represent him in the robbery charge, then he talks to the

23

client, the client says, there's a lot of other stuff I

24

think you ought to know in order to represent me well, and

25

then he goes and interviews him at great length about all
22

He's appointed then to

1

these things that happened in the same transaction, but

2

they've never been indicted.

3

entitled to be paid for the time he spent on questioning

4

about the related crimes?

5

MS. BLATT:

Would that lawyer be

I think to the extent that the --

6

yes, and to the extent that the defense relates to the

7

pending charge.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

It has no relation to the pending

charge, except it was part of the same bunch of
transactions.
MS. BLATT:

If he said to his lawyer, I also

12

murdered these two people, I think it would be perfectly

13

clear that the -- if the defendant went off and started

14

researching capital sentencing procedures under Texas law

15

he very well might not get paid for that.

16

appointed to represent his client on the burglary charge.

17

He certainly can take on a scope of representation that's

18

greater than that, and can work out an arrangement with

19

his client to get paid for that.

20

QUESTION:

He was

So he's -- the lawyer, the good,

21

conscientious lawyer would say, well, don't talk to me

22

about that because I'm not going to get paid for any

23

advice I give to you on that, on those matters?

24
25

MS. BLATT:

No, he certainly will want to talk

to his client with respect to the conduct that constituted
23

1

the offense for which he's been charged, and there might

2

be other things he needs to know about.

3

QUESTION:

But if it doesn't survive the

4

Blockburger test, the fact that it happened at the same

5

time, that wouldn't justify the lawyer spending any time

6

on it?

7

MS. BLATT:

He will need to spend whatever time

8

is necessary to defend him on the pending charge ,but he's

9

certainly free to tell his client, I'm not competent to

10

represent you in a death penalty case and you ought to

11

retain separate counsel for that offense, and moreover,

12

you haven't even been charged with that offense.

13

In all these cases where there is a pending

14

charge, the court in McNeil and in Moulton represented --

15

excuse me, recognized the compelling interest that the

16

police have in investigating and solving uncharged

17

offenses, and if the suspect never indicates any

18

unwillingness to talk to the police about those offenses,

19

there's no basis for excluding what is concededly a

20

voluntary confession to those crimes that might otherwise

21

go unsolved.

22

The other thing I wanted to say, just about the

23

Blockburger test, is that this Court, in the context of

24

double jeopardy and the lesser-included offenses context,

25

has recognized that that test is workable, and is
24

1
2

predictable, and can lead to consistent results.
QUESTION:

Workable in court from double

3

jeopardy determinations; workable when you're talking

4

about the police officer, I'm less certain.

5

MS. BLATT:

I think the police officer can

6

certainly ascertain immediately what the pending charge

7

was against the suspect, and if he has any questions about

8

the elements test he can certainly ask a prosecutor, but

9

generally the police can be advised, as this Court

10

recognized in Moulton, that it's okay to approach a

11

suspect that's under indictment about additional crimes,

12

and so the question just simply becomes, what's a separate

13

offense, and that's a lot easier question than, is it

14

possible that the suspect may say something that's so -- a

15

court may or may not later deem inextricably intertwined,

16

such that the statements can't be used.

17

If there are no other questions --

18

QUESTION:

19

Mr. Greenwood, we'll hear from you.

Thank you, Ms. Blatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY E. GREENWOOD

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. GREENWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are asking only that this Court follow its
prior precedents in Brewer and Maine v. Moulton.
25

We don't

1

want to expand any constitutional application.

2

QUESTION:

Well, but we've said in McNeil that

3

it's offense-specific --

4

MR. GREENWOOD:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, ma'am.

-- this Sixth Amendment right, and

6

here there was at the time of the burglary charge no

7

evidence of the murder -- the murders, or the defendant's

8

connection with them, so why isn't that a separate

9

offense?

10

MR. GREENWOOD:

Your Honor, in looking at the

11

Court's, initially the Fifth Amendment cases on the right

12

of counsel and then the stair-stepping and the filling in

13

of the blanks of the various phases where counsel has come

14

in, as we've all had to do in the research for these

15

cases, and we get to McNeil -- and we have no problem with

16

McNeil.

17

written.

18
19

McNeil makes sense in the context in which it was

QUESTION:

Well, how about its statement that

Sixth Amendment right is offense-specific?

20

MR. GREENWOOD:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Your Honor, in --

You have to go beyond that, don't

you?
MR. GREENWOOD:

Your Honor, I can -- under -- in

24

the context of the way, the facts of McNeil, I can see

25

that statement being legitimately and perfectly
26

1

reasonable, but McNeil --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GREENWOOD:

4

QUESTION:

5

cases.

6

sharply limit it.

7

But it's a categorical statement.
Yes, Your Honor, it is.

So you are asking us to go beyond our

You're asking us to distinguish McNeil and very

MR. GREENWOOD:

No, Your Honor.

That statement,

8

taken in separation with the facts of McNeil and the

9

issues presented I think are really different, and I

10

recognize -- we've reviewed you all's decisions,

11

concurring and dissenting opinions here, and we understand

12

you all's concerns about that, but in our view, in

13

starting with McNeil, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the

14

question before them was unrelated offenses, and this

15

Court granted cert on unrelated offenses, and during the

16

argument of counsel the Government on at least three

17

separate occasions in McNeil, and we've got their

18

transcripts, said this is -- the situation here is

19

completely separate and distinct offenses, different

20

counties, different victims, different facts.

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but you can limit any one of our

22

opinions in that respect to say, you know, this happened

23

on a Tuesday and not on a Wednesday, but we employ

24

statements as to what we think the law is and so on in

25

deciding these cases, and it isn't always limited just to
27

1
2

the particular facts.
MR. GREENWOOD:

That's true, Your Honor, and --

3

but it just, from our viewpoint, even though McNeil makes

4

sense as to separate and distinct offenses, when you look

5

at Brewer, and Moulton, and the interrelated, intertwined

6

defenses, to us you just simply cannot say, well, the line

7

of Brewer just stopped, because --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

What is your definition of, quote,

intertwined, close quote, or interrelated, close quote?
MR. GREENWOOD:

In looking at all of these

11

things and trying to make a decision, the simplest and

12

easiest definition we got to is just the related offenses,

13

where those that occur in one single immediate transaction

14

and incident.

15

QUESTION:

Well, okay.

16

this doesn't make it any easier.

17

What's an incident?

18

MR. GREENWOOD:

Okay.

What is a -- you know,
What's a transaction?

Well, transaction is

19

defined -- is not even defined under Texas joinder law, so

20

you get a dictionary out, but at the same immediate

21

temporal time and place.

22
23

QUESTION:

And you think this case meets that

definition --

24

MR. GREENWOOD:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-- of the same time?
28

1

MR. GREENWOOD:

2

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Mr. Greenwood, I think your, sort of

3

your strongest argument is that, if you don't recognize

4

the scope of the right as you argue for it, that the risk

5

that the Sixth Amendment right in the -- with respect to

6

the first offense will be infringed is simply too great,

7

and you cannot run that risk, and this is the way to avoid

8

it.

9

Mr. Coleman has essentially two responses to

10

that, and I'd like you to comment on them.

11

response is that if the subsequent interrogation is a

12

custodial one, the Miranda warnings are going to be there,

13

and they functionally will assuage your concern and that

14

in any event, even in a noncustodial case and, a fortiori,

15

in the custodial case, if, in fact, there is a violation

16

of Sixth Amendment right with respect to the first

17

offense, any evidence so given will be excluded with

18

respect to the first offense.

19

these two avenues of warning or relief are sufficient to

20

reduce the concern about the risk that you raise.

21

you respond?

22

MR. GREENWOOD:

The first

And he in effect says,

How do

Initially, Your Honor, one of

23

the concerns that I have is, as the Chief Justice wrote in

24

one of his dissenting opinions, I think in Moulton,

25

correct me if I'm wrong, that there has not been in the
29

1

past wholesale violation of Sixth Amendment problems by

2

law enforcement.

3

in this, these more than two decades of cases that dealt

4

with this related offense concept have generally kept the

5

police away from the defendant in these related contacts,

6

so you haven't had wholesale --

7

I think to allow -- but over the years

QUESTION:

Right, but let's assume we no longer

8

have that regime, but we have the regime that your brother

9

argues for and he says the two safeguards are Miranda in

10

custodial cases, exclusion in noncustodial cases if the

11

interrogation strays into the evidence on the first

12

offense.

13

MR. GREENWOOD:

The immediate, most immediate

14

concern I have is that a statement by this Court that that

15

is permissible will encourage police officers to make

16

those contacts.

17

QUESTION:

Let's assume that it does.

Let's

18

assume that no, this relatedness test is not the proper

19

test, there's going to be more interrogation.

20

MR. GREENWOOD:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Absolutely.

We're all assuming that.

Now, why

are his two safeguards going to be insufficient?
MR. GREENWOOD:

Under the facts of this case,

24

and because the -- and I must preface this just briefly.

25

This can be a complicated situation, with regard to Sixth
30

1

Amendment and the related offenses, and that's why most of

2

the courts of appeals, Fifth Circuit and Third Circuit,

3

have devised a list of factors, totality of the

4

circumstances, which we think are necessary.

5

Having said that, in this case, for example, you

have a long-term, 17 months or more, attorney-client

relationship.

didn't know that the word, offense-specific, in McNeil,

whether it referred to something on paper --

MR. GREENWOOD:

QUESTION:

Right.

-- namely, the definition of a crime,

18

or something in the world, such as the robber entering the

19

bank, hitting the teller and taking the money, which, of

20

course, could be one of several crimes.

QUESTION:

Well, take it, Mr. Greenwood.
31

Take

it.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. GREENWOOD:

Youur Honor, in dealing with all

4

this, we have looked at the term transaction, because

5

that's a series of acts of conduct which can have one

6

offense or dozens.

7

in this context.

The term crimes means different things
The term --

MR. GREENWOOD:

It's what we do.
Right.

Can I get back to your description of

15

what was going on here?

16

had dealt with him over many cases.

17

understand about your case, or about the rule that you're

18

urging upon us, is why it makes a difference that the

19

other offense was factually related, was simultaneous.

20

The man had a lawyer, the police
What I can't

I mean, I can understand the position that,

look, once a man has a lawyer -- I have a lawyer for

24

entirely separate embezzlement -- or, I'm interrogated

25

about an entirely separate embezzlement on May 14th.

I'm a stockbroker, and I'm charged with

I'm charged with an

I

1

would feel just as strongly as you do about, well, it's

2

only fair they know the man has a lawyer, they shouldn't

3

go to him without going to his lawyer.

4

They know the man has a lawyer to represent him

5

vis-a-vis the police.

6

whether it's factually related or not, if you're going to

7

appeal to that, I don't know, that feeling once you know a

8

guy has a lawyer, you ought to deal with his lawyer?

9

don't see that the factual relationship makes me feel any

10
11
12

What difference does it make

worse about it.
MR. GREENWOOD:

QUESTION:

14

MR. GREENWOOD:

16

Your Honor, I agree with that,

but since --

13

15

I

Okay, well -Since McNeil, it does make a

difference, and -QUESTION:

Well, I think unless we're going to

17

go all the way down to the bottom of that slippery slope

18

it makes sense to say what you have a lawyer for is for

19

the charge, and that the choice is between saying you have

20

a lawyer for that charge, and the police can deal with you

21

separately on any matter that is apart from that charge,

22

and if you're not going to adopt that rule you really

23

ought to jump all the way over to the rule that once

24

you're represented by a lawyer with regard to this police

25

department, with regard to matters that -- concerning this
33

1

defendant, they ought to contact that lawyer for

2

everything they have to do with that defendant.

3

MR. GREENWOOD:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Well, and that's part --

And that's a big extension of what

we've said up to now.
MR. GREENWOOD:

In the decisions of the courts

7

of appeals on this issue dealing with the totality of the

8

circumstances, one of the important things in making sure

9

that the concerns of the court with regard to really

10

hamstringing law enforcement are not overdone, is limiting

11

it to a single criminal investigation in a jurisdiction by

12

the same type of law enforcement, and we'll go along with

13

that, because we can think of hypotheticals --

14
15

QUESTION:

What do you mean, you'll go along

with it if we do that?

16

MR. GREENWOOD:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. GREENWOOD:

You don't have much choice.
No, I understand.

We will take that, Your Honor,

19

as to a limitation.

20

McNeil, obviously, Koolman v. Wilson.

21

brief that ongoing and future crimes should be exempted

22

from this related offense rule.

23

QUESTION:

There are limitations on this.
We concede in our

It's not just an exemption.

You've

24

said that, I think, the law enforcement would be seriously

25

hamstrung -34

1

MR. GREENWOOD:

2

QUESTION:

3

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

-- if the simple fact that a person

had a lawyer stopped policemen from asking him questions.

4

MR. GREENWOOD:

5

QUESTION:

Right.

All right.

But that isn't true where

6

you're talking about a single offense defined in terms of

7

what happens in the world, I take it.

8
9

MR. GREENWOOD:

That's correct.

That's correct,

and we are afraid that if the Court follows the

10

petitioner's argument that, because of the ability of law

11

enforcement and prosecutors to charge in a matter of

12

discretion at their will, they can, in fact pick different

13

crimes and then make dozens of confrontations with the

14

defendant.

15

For example, in this case --

16

QUESTION:

But to stop to ask a less friendly

17

question, I think what's worrying the department and

18

others is that once you depart from the definition of

19

offense in terms of some words on paper, i.e., once you

20

start looking to what happened in the world, there's no

21

good way to define what is the same offense, and therefore

22

they get into a mess, and therefore we have six different

23

circuits trying to do different things.

24

MR. GREENWOOD:

25

QUESTION:

Right.

And you say in response to that, no,
35

1

there is a good way, and what is it?

2

MR. GREENWOOD:

I -- in the brief before the

3

Court of Criminal Appeals we followed the Third and Fifth

4

Circuits' totality of circumstances test, and followed it

5

right down the line with regard to that.

6

factors could have totally thrown off the analysis of this

7

case.

8
9

QUESTION:

Any one of those

Of course, the problem that the law

enforcement has is not only that they don't know how to

10

define what is a related offense, but that they also don't

11

know whether the offense that they're inquiring about

12

meets that definition or not.

13

second problem which existed here.

14

whether the kidnapping was done at the same time as the

15

murder, whether the two were related or not.

That is a totally separate
They did not know

16

It's a real problem, not just figuring out a

17

definition, but also figuring out whether what they're

18

asking about falls within that definition or not.

19

won't know that until the facts are fully known.

20

MR. GREENWOOD:

They

That is true, and in our attempt

21

at definition to limit expansion of this concept any

22

longer, is the transaction or incident in a temporal time

23

and place seems to be the least expansive you can get, and

24

most police officers --

25

QUESTION:

What if the police here thought that
36

1

the kidnapping had occurred on a different day from the

2

burglary, that he had done the kidnapping and the murder

3

and then he'd gone back the next day and burglarized the

4

place?

5
6
7

MR. GREENWOOD:

I don't think under the facts

you could have gotten there, but assuming that -QUESTION:

Is it enough that they thought that

8

and it turns out not to be the case, they're nonetheless

9

not violating the Sixth Amendment rights?

10
11

MR. GREENWOOD:

something like that, you would have two separate crimes --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GREENWOOD:

14
15

You would have -- if you had

I understand that.
-- really, as opposed to the

same transaction.
QUESTION:

No, but it didn't turn out that way.

16

It turned out that they were both done on the same day.

17

Now, but you're going to let the police off because they

18

thought it was on separate days, right?

19

MR. GREENWOOD:

Oh, well, thought, but you see,

20

if the facts show otherwise, then you have a set of facts

21

that can be analyzed.

22

QUESTION:

So they can't talk at all then,

23

because even though they think it happened on a separate

24

day and therefore, believing they're in full compliance

25

with the Sixth Amendment they interrogate the person
37

1

without his lawyer, it turns out that they happened on the

2

same day, and all this evidence has to be thrown out.

3

MR. GREENWOOD:

I may have missed some of that,

4

Your Honor, but law enforcement officers deal with

5

transactions and incidents daily --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GREENWOOD:

8

I understand.
-- and that, it seems to me,

would be the easiest definition.

9

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that what matters

10

is the reality, or what matters is what the interrogator

11

believes when he conducts the interrogation?

12

MR. GREENWOOD:

I will concede that at the time

13

what he legitimately believes.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GREENWOOD:

Okay.
Yes.

That makes sense, under --

16

in considering all this, because you could have a bizarre

17

circumstance when no one would know when certain crimes

18

occurred.

19

QUESTION:

-- just not sure.

I mean, does he

20

have to know that it was at the same time, or suppose he's

21

in a state of complete agnosticism.

22

it occurred.

23

MR. GREENWOOD:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GREENWOOD:

He doesn't know when

In --

Is he violating the Sixth Amendment?
A police officer in a -- I
38

1

cannot answer the question.

2

that concept --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GREENWOOD:

That -- I do not think of

I can't, either.
But -- but, if I knew a police

5

officer who had no knowledge or intent, really -- I'm

6

trying to separate it from this case.

7

difficulty -- had really no knowledge that an

8

investigation was going on and that we want to interrogate

9

him about this serious crime, then I could see a judge

That's my

10

under the totality-of-the-circumstances test saying,

11

there's no either bad faith or negligence or intentional

12

or even accidental violation of the Sixth Amendment.

13

haven't been able to work out your factual question far

14

enough down the line, sorry.

I

15

But I do believe -- in this case, for example,

16

in the Texas statutory scheme, this defendant could have

17

been charged, well, with nine different capital crimes,

18

and three of them, at least three of them are under

19

statutorily different offenses which would have allowed

20

prosecution under Blockburger, even though it's the same

21

offenses, same exact conduct, and where -- we are

22

concerned that under a circumstance where an attorney has

23

been representing a defendant for a substantial length of

24

time, and he consults and investigates on this limited,

25

immediate transaction about various crimes, and he tells,
39

1

and he consults the attorney about what we're going to do

2

-- for example, in the example it was asked if he was

3

arrested on one offense, he said, by the way, I killed two

4

other people.

5

Well, I know what I would do if I was his

6

counsel, and take all possible avenues to try to protect

7

him under my responsibility.

8

this whole issue here with the responsibility of the scope

9

of counsel.

I give a lot of credence in

10

In the McNeil argument one of the attorney --

11

QUESTION:

Well, I know what you'd do, too.

12

You'd say, take the Miranda advice seriously, refuse to

13

answer any questions now, later, a week from now, a month

14

from now, and then you're protected.

15
16
17

MR. GREENWOOD:

That's it.

That, of course, is what their

position is, Your Honor, and -QUESTION:

Isn't that implied by what you were

18

just saying?

19

to his client, don't talk to them about anything, no

20

matter what, unless I'm there, and why isn't that one of

21

the answers to the concerns that you're raising?

22

I mean, any prudent lawyer is going to say

MR. GREENWOOD:

We believe that if the Court

23

allows this continuous conduct where law enforcement can

24

come in on a regular basis, in this case, literally dozens

25

of times could have come back at Mr. Cobb to interrogate
40

1

him about all the potential offenses, that it gives

2

certain rise to complete abuse.

3

QUESTION:

But Mr. Greenwood --

4

QUESTION:

He can say no any time.

5
6

refuse to talk to them.
MR. GREENWOOD:

He can

His lawyer has advised him.
And we say they -- once he has

7

counsel, in these facts they know he has counsel, they

8

ought to stay away from him.

9

QUESTION:

10

They -- first, the Odessa people

didn't know he had counsel.

11

MR. GREENWOOD:

They didn't know.

12

QUESTION:

13

that I hope you will address.

14

that this case may not be a strong case for your position,

15

even if we were to take a related-offense view of it.

But there's another aspect to this
In this -- it seems to me

16

As I understand Jackson, the purpose was to keep

17

the police from badgering a defendant, keep coming back at

18

him and back at him, and even though he's been given

19

Miranda warnings, to wear down his will.

20

there was a considerable interval of time.

21

out of custody, he was living with his father, and in that

22

interval he could have talked to his lawyer many times.

23

When he has that interval why, in that case, isn't Miranda

24

enough, when he's not in custody where he's --

25

MR. GREENWOOD:

In this case
Defendant was

I still maintain that as long as
41

1

that formal charge was pending, and the counsel

2

relationship continued, that when you throw law

3

enforcement into talking to the defendant without his

4

counsel, that you're still subjecting the defendant to

5

abuses because, primarily, of the Moran v. Burbine

6

decision that allows police officers to lie to the

7

defendants, and you're getting a conflict, more than

8

likely, which will encourage a conflict of statements

9

between what the lawyer's telling him and what the police

10

officers are telling him.

11

QUESTION:

I suppose, Mr. Greenwood, that your

12

response to the contention that it ought to be enough that

13

his lawyer tells him at the very beginning, look it, I'm

14

only representing you on this crime, but you shouldn't

15

talk to them about any other crime, you got that?

16

Yes.

Don't talk to them at all.

17

Yes.

Yes, yes, I understand.

The argument that that suffices, what's wrong

18

with that is that if it suffices here it would have

19

sufficed or ought to have sufficed in Michigan v. Jackson

20

as well.

21

that's not enough?

22

it, I'm your lawyer now, don't talk to the police without

23

me, and yet Michigan v. Jackson still says, even though

24

the lawyer's told him that, if the police try to talk to

25

him without him, it's a constitutional violation.

I mean, doesn't Michigan v. Jackson assume that
The lawyer's going to tell him, look

42

1

MR. GREENWOOD:

2

QUESTION:

3

wrong.

Right.

So maybe Michigan v. Jackson is

I mean, if --

4

MR. GREENWOOD:

No, Your Honor.

We still

5

maintain that Jackson is a proper continuation of Sixth

6

Amendment jurisprudence.

7

QUESTION:

And I suppose the same answer that

8

Justice Scalia just outlined for you is your answer to the

9

question that I raised earlier about your brother's

10

argument.

11

why wasn't Miranda good enough to protect him there?

12

If Miranda is good enough to protect him here,

MR. GREENWOOD:

We just believe that if you rely

13

on this, the invocation of the Fifth Amendment on these

14

related offenses, you're going to have officers, encourage

15

them to make more and more contact with the defendant and

16

invade that attorney-client relationship with false

17

information, which I think will lead to more abuses.

18

That's all the questions?

19

QUESTION:

20

Maybe -- well, this is just to

clarify something that I had trouble understanding.

21

MR. GREENWOOD:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

Suppose that a person is -- what's

23

the law in the following situation?

The person, a

24

defendant is put into custody, a suspect, he's

25

interrogated.

He's told about his Miranda rights.
43

He

1

gets a lawyer, and then he's not charged, all right?

2

not charged.

3

He's

The next day, although the police know he got a

4

lawyer, he has a lawyer, they call him back to question

5

him again without telling the lawyer.

6

MR. GREENWOOD:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GREENWOOD:

9

QUESTION:

10

Can they do that?

I think they could, Your Honor.

Thank you, Mr. Greenwood.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Coleman, you have 1 minute

remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. COLEMAN:

I'd like to very quickly address

14

Justice Stevens' question about the scope of

15

representation and real-world fact scenarios that are

16

uncharged, and I think in both of those instances I can go

17

back beyond the cases of this Court and say, those are not

18

criminal prosecutions, and that person has not been

19

accused of those factually-related crimes, and the Sixth

20

Amendment by its own text simply does not apply in those

21

types of circumstances.

22

When -- and also, in both of those

23

circumstances, if the defendant or the suspect is

24

questioned he can say, at the advice of his counsel, I

25

don't want to talk to you, in other words cuts him off.
