ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. LAYTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

In 1933, when Congress authorized the

12

organization of banks for cooperatives, it implicitly

13

authorized the States to tax them.

14

effective for each bank when it retired the Government

15

shares.

16

Missouri until 1995, but according to the Missouri supreme

17

court the bank's tax liability ended in 1985.

18

failed to recognize the bank's exemption from taxes is and

19

always has been provided by statute, and that staute, now

20

12 U.S.C. 2134, exempts from taxation only the bank's

21

notes, debentures, and other obligations, not its income.

22

That authority became

The National Bank for Cooperatives paid taxes to

That court

In deciding what section 2134 means, the

23

Missouri supreme court erred in three respects.

24

transformed a technical and conforming amendment into a

25

significant change in the Farm Credit Act, it made that
3

It

1

transformation by adding to the plain language of the

2

statute, and it turned the statute into something that is

3

incongruous to the rest of the Farm Credit Act.

4

Before 1985, the statute provided that CoBank

5

and its predecessors would always pay taxes on real and

6

tangible personal property and, at any time when the

7

Government did not own shares, they would pay other taxes

8

to State and local governments and perhaps even to the

9

Federal Government.

The question arises here as to what

10

happened in 1985, and the position being taken by CoBank

11

is that in 1985 suddenly they were freed from all taxes,

12

and yet that is not what the statute said in 1985.

13

There was a technical and conforming amendment

14

that appeared in title 2 of the 1984 -- 5 act.

15

was the part of the act that was dedicated to making the

16

Farm Credit Administration an arm's length regulator for

17

the farm credit system, something more akin to what we see

18

at the FDIC and other bank regulators in the Federal

19

system.

20

amendments.

21

which CoBank cites here as a new vehicle for investment

22

into the farm credit system.

23

Title 2

Title 1 of that act also included conforming
Title 1 dealt with the credit corporation

The second point that the Missouri court erred

24

on is transforming the plain language by adding to it.

25

The plain language of the statute is simply that this
4

1

entity is exempt from taxation as to its notes, debentures

2

and other obligations.

3

of the exemption given to the banks for cooperatives has

4

been contained in statutes.

5

Ever since 1933, the entire scope

The only thing that anyone can point to in the

6

statute today that goes beyond notes, debentures, and

7

obligations is the reference to this entity as a Federal

8

instrumentality, but this Court has at various times

9

suggested or, in fact, held that Federal instrumentality

10

does not have the kind of meaning that CoBank ascribes to

11

it.

12
13

QUESTION:

It has, I take it, been described as

such by statute from the very beginning.

14

MR. LAYTON:

From the very beginning, Your

15

Honor, and that's significant, because even in 1933, what

16

rights or ablities a Federal instrumentality had was

17

unclear.

18

Certainly -QUESTION:

But don't we have -- isn't the

19

statute -- as I understand the statute, it used to say,

20

your bonds are exempt and your income is exempt as long as

21

the stock's being held by the Board of Governors.

22

MR. LAYTON:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's right.
All right.

Now, they get rid of the

second part because nobody holds the stock any more.
MR. LAYTON:

That's right.

QUESTION:

All right.

first part.

3

MR. LAYTON:

4

QUESTION:

5

So we're left with the

That's right.
And what you rather briliantly say

is, ha-ha, that means McCulloch clicks in.

6

MR. LAYTON:

7

QUESTION:

Well -And since McCulloch clicks in, since

8

it doesn't say it doesn't, they're exempt anyway as a

9

Federal instrumentality.

10

MR. LAYTON:

Well, I think that's what they say.

11

That isn't what we would say.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LAYTON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LAYTON:

Right.

Right.

That's what they say.

We would say that they're not -Exactly, right.
That's right, and this Court, and

16

in fact Congress has never suggested that there could be

17

this kind of a hybrid provision for exemption.

18

the instances where we have a financial institution that

19

seeks an exemption from taxes, Congress has either defined

20

the whole scope of that exemption, or left it blank.

21

QUESTION:

All right.

In each of

Now, given that's their

22

argument, and given we're left with the remnant, why

23

doesn't McCulloch click in?

24
25

MR. LAYTON:

Well, first off that -- the

McCulloch -- well, McCulloch holds that a Federal
6

1

instrumentality cannot be taxed discriminatorily and in

2

fact goes beyond that to say you can't import -- impose

3

certain kinds of taxes.

4

suggest that anything that might be labeled a Federal

5

instrumentality qualifies.

6

QUESTION:

McCulloch, however, does not

One obvious reason -- one obvious

7

reason would be because they're not a Federal

8

instrumentality.

9

That's A.

MR. LAYTON:

10

QUESTION:

That's A.

11

lurking here, that --

12

MR. LAYTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LAYTON:

Now, is there a second argument

Yes.
That's what I'm -That McCulloch is restricted to an

15

instrumentality of the type that this Court addressed in

16

the New Mexico case, and we can see the comparison fairly

17

bluntly here.

18

The Second Bank of the United States was run by

19

presidential appointees.

The Federal Government owned 20

20

percent of the shares in that bank, and that bank

21

performed governmental functions, not just functions in

22

which the Government had an interest, but it actually

23

issued currency.

24

must do.

25

States was a little like the Red Cross that this Court

It did things that the Government itself

In that sense, the Second Bank of the United

7

1

addressed in the Department of Employment case.

2

presidential appointees run the Red Cross, and that entity

3

fulfills treaty obligations that the United States assumed

4

under the Geneva Convention.

Again,

The -- CoBank mentions the Rural Telephone Bank

member board of directors.

8

the President of the United States.

9

Rural Telephone Bank is appointed by the Secretary of

10

Agriculture, and there is a direct appropriation from

11

Congress in a -- over a 10-year period of -- or 20-year

12

period of $600 billion for the Rural Telephone Bank.

13

Well, the Rural Telephone Bank has a 13Seven of them are appointed by
The Governor of the

By contrast, here we have an entity that from

14

the beginning has been controlled by a board of directors

15

that is appointed by its voting shareholders, which did

16

not include the United States.

17

It has always been a private entity, quite distinct from

18

the things that we see in McCulloch.

19

That is, by the borrowers.

So what's the distinction from McCulloch?

20

McCulloch holds that if you have something that is an

21

instrumentality of the type that is the Second Bank of the

22

United States, then in fact there is, absent any

23

congressional language, immunity.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, I guess on the side of your

opponent is the fact that these banks were created to
8

1

perform an important governmental function by extending

2

reliable credit to farmers at the lowest possible cost.

3

MR. LAYTON:

4

QUESTION:

5

And that's certainly true.
Right?

governmental interest.

6

MR. LAYTON:

7

QUESTION:

8

I mean, that was an important

Yes.
And by subjecting them to taxation,

it's going to drive up that cost.

9

MR. LAYTON:

Well, it may or may not drive up

10

that cost.

It's interesting to look a little at the

11

history of what happened here.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LAYTON:

In 1933 --

Assuming it does -Assuming it does, assuming that it

14

does drive up the cost, then that would certainly affect

15

the ability of these entities to fulfill that interest in

16

which the Government has an interest, yes, it would.

17

QUESTION:

18

from that interest?

19

MR. LAYTON:

Is that enough, then, to exempt them

No, it is not.

It is not.

If that

20

were enough, then anything that Congress creates within

21

its power and says it has a governmental interest could be

22

exempted, or inherently exempted from State tax.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Would you amend your answer to say,

anything the Government calls an instrumentality?
MR. LAYTON:

Well, no.
9

I don't know that the

1

Government has to call something an instrumentality in

2

order to give it the exemption under that approach.

3

Again, instrumentality doesn't have a meaning that is

4

precise as CoBank wishes that it did.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

Did the statute in McCulloch say --

use the term, instrumentality of the United States?
MR. LAYTON:

No.

There was no statute in

8

McCulloch that referred to a tax exemption, and that is

9

one of the distinctions.

10

QUESTION:

11

the Bank of the United States.

12

MR. LAYTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

No, I mean, but the statute creating

As far as I know, it did not.
Did it call it an instrumentality of

the United States?

15

MR. LAYTON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LAYTON:

No.
My recollection is that it didn't.
I -- there's no mention in the case

18

suggesting that it did, and that matters in the sense

19

that -- well, not just that it didn't use that phrase, but

20

there's no exemption statute at issue in McCulloch.

21

is, Congress, when it created the Second Bank of the

22

United States, didn't say, okay, you have the following

23

exemptions from State and local taxes, but that's what

24

Congress at least since 1916, when it started the farm

25

credit system, has done consistently for the financial
10

That

1

entities within the farm credit system.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Layton, there's a reason that the

3

other side gives for the exemption of the debt

4

obligations, because, they say, those obligations are held

5

not in the hands of CoBank but in the hands of the

6

lenders, so you need an exemption so that those lenders,

7

who are private and not government instrumentalities,

8

won't be taxed.

9

MR. LAYTON:

Well, it's curious that they make

10

that claim in a brief where they also cite the Memphis

11

case in section 742 of, I beileve it's title 31, which, if

12

this entity is part of the United States, that is, if this

13

bank of cooperatives has the inherent authority that they

14

ascribe to it, then 742 would cover them, and this

15

provision would be superfluous in 2134.

16

cover them, because they are not an instrumentality of

17

this sort, and Congress has defined the scope of their

18

authority.

19

But it doesn't

In 1928, this Court in the Shaw v. Gibson-

20

Zahniser Oil case, just a few years before the 1933 act

21

that created the Bank for Cooperatives, pointed out that

22

there are instrumentalities of the United States that do

23

not have exemptions unless Congress gives them an

24

exemption, and then 5 years later Congress in this

25

instance defines what the exemption is, and what CoBank
11

1

and what the Missouri supreme court have done is to say,

2

well, that definition by Congress doesn't really matter.

3

The third point that I mentioned was that it

4

turns the statute into something in Congress with the rest

5

of the Farm Credit Act.

6

Farm Credit Act, where Congress has created an entity that

7

is even -- that is analogous to this particular one,

8

Congress has said, okay, here is the kind of exmeption

9

that you have from State and local taxes.

That is, in each instance in the

It always is a

10

comprehensive statement, and does not leave room for some

11

kind of an argument that there is an additional exemption

12

based on some kind of inherent immunity, and in each

13

instance it permits taxation of real property and in many

14

instances taxation of tangible personal property.

15

And one of the differences that occurred in

16

1985, according to CoBank, is all of a sudden the statute

17

changed from allowing State and local governments to tax

18

tangible personal property to including only a real

19

property exemption which they ascribe back to the dicta in

20

McCulloch.

21

In fact, there may be a problem with tangible

22

personal property.

I'm not sure how much of that CoBank

23

would be likely to foreclose upon, but the same statutory

24

language is used for the production credit associations,

25

and it is easily understood that there would be tractors
12

1

and other equipment that they would foreclose upon that

2

would justify the need for a provision for taxation on

3

tangible local -- tangible personal property.

4

QUESTION:

Do we have some cases that say that

5

if you call it a technical amendment, then we can go back

6

behind the intention of the Congress as, treat it as

7

something of a different order than a straight-out

8

repealer?

9

MR. LAYTON:

No.

There are a couple of cases

10

cited in our brief that stand for the proposition that we

11

don't expect Congress to use technical amendments to make

12

this kind of a change, but neither of them actually says,

13

yes, we can then go back behind the language to determine

14

what Congress did.

15

But here you don't have to go behind the

16

language to committee reports or something like that.

17

Just look at what the language was.

18

do what CoBank now says they did, all they had to do was

19

eliminate the last sentence in the prior statute.

20

is, the sentence that said, okay, here's the point at

21

which the State's authority to tax begins.

22

If Congress wanted to

That

If that had been the scope of the -- of

23

Congress' action, just eliminating that last sentence,

24

then except for the tangible personal property question

25

CoBank would have today exactly what they wanted, but that
13

1

sentence says, okay, the exemption that we are giving you

2

in the prior sentence -- that is, you don't have one until

3

we give it to you.

4

prior sentence is going to apply only to a certain point.

5

And when Congress acted here, they took out not

The exemption we are giving you in the

6

just the, okay, it applies at a certain point, but

7

exemption that they had given, and so today there is no

8

exemption in the statute, and the banks for cooperatives

9

are responsible for paying taxes to State and local

10

governments.

11
12

If there are no further questions, I'll reserve
the rest of my time for rebuttal.

13
14

QUESTION:

We'll hear from you now, Mr.

Frederick.

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

16

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

18
19
20

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Our position is that banks for cooperatives

21

under the Farm Credit Act are not exempt from State income

22

taxes for two reasons.

23

its decision to an analsyis of the text of the Farm Credit

24

Act, and not go beyond it to discuss or address the

25

constitutional issues relating to Federal

We think the Court should confine

14

1
2

instrumentalities.
Under the text of the act itself there are two

3

reasons why banks for cooperatives are not exempt from

4

State income taxes.

5

section 2134, the first sentence itself just addresses an

6

exemption for notes, debentures, and obligations.

7

provision contrasts with two other provisions of the Farm

8

Credit Act that specifically give State income tax

9

exemptions for other entities of the farm credit system.

First, as the State counsel noted, at

That

10

12 U.S.C. 2023 provides an exemption from State income

11

taxes for farm credit banks and provides expressly that

12

Congress intended for those entities to be exempt from

13

State income taxes.

14

Moreover, 12 U.S.C. 2098 provides an express

15

exemption from State income taxes for Federal land bank

16

associations.

17

enacted this statute, and it amended it over a 50-year

18

period, it knew precisely how to give the kind of

19

exemption from State income taxes being asserted by

20

respondents in this case and chose not to do so.

21

It's clear, therefore, that when Congress

Secondly, the history behind this provision, as

22

the Stte counsel made perfectly clear, does not support

23

respondent's position.

24

itself provided for the exemption from State income taxes

25

only in any part of a year in which the Government owned

Between 1933 and 1985, the text

15

1

stock.

2

and 1968, the Government retired all of its shares of

3

stock in banks for cooperatives.

4

That ended in 1968.

From a period between 1965

So as of 1968, and this is reflected in the Farm

5

Credit Administration's annual report, banks for

6

cooperatives were not exempt from Federal and State income

7

taxes.

8

decades later, in the 1985 Farm Credit Amendments Act,

9

there was no Government ownership in any banks for

10

cooperatives.

11

profit entities and, as such, would have been subject to

12

State income taxes throughout the entire period.

13

These were completely privately owned for-

Now, the last point that I'd like to make is

14

that the Court should not reach out to opine about

15

instrumentality status generally.

16

consistently under the Farm Credit Act has looked at the

17

text of the act to determine the scope of exemptions from

18

taxation, and that's true in all of the cases that have

19

been cited by the parties under the Farm Credit Act.

20

should not use this case to opine broadly about what

21

instrumentalitiy status means for several reasons.

This -- the Court

It

22

First, Congress uses the term, instrumentality,

23

in a broader range of contexts, and even in this case and

24

in this statute itself, has used it to describe not only

25

the organizations that are being used to facilitate
16

1

Congress' purpose, but also the financial instruments

2

themselves.

3

tax exemption provision, describes the notes themselves as

4

the instrumentalities of the United States, and so by

5

making a decision about what instrumentality status means,

6

the Court could end up having -- could create unintended

7

consequences that would affect the taxable status of

8

instrumentalities throughout the Government.

9
10

Section 2023, which is the Farm Credit Bank

QUESTION:

Well, maybe Congress has already

created that confusion by using the term inconsistently.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, that is

12

certainly an area that Congress would certainly want to

13

address.

14

and I would give a second reason, and that's that Congress

15

imposes certain obligations on agencies and

16

instrumentalities that are apart from tax questions,

17

reporting obligations for data to the Secretary of

18

Commerce, encouraging --

19

The question, though, is, by using that term,

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Frederick, isn't it true

20

that for purposes of deciding this case, if we have to

21

-- if we rule in your favor and the favor of the

22

petitioner, we must decide that the mere fact that it's

23

labeled an instrumentality is not sufficient to give a tax

24

exemption?

25

MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice Stevens.
17

What the

1

Court would say is that use of the instrumentality

2

language by itself would not render the rest of the tax

3

exemption language in the Farm Credit Act surplusage, and

4

the Court would say that Congress defined the scope of the

5

tax exempt status of these particular instrumentalities by

6

expressly dealing with tax exempt status, and that's how

7

the court did it in the First Agricultural Bank case in

8

1968, when it addressed a very similar question for the

9

national banks, and there the Court said, we're going to

10

look at the text of the statute to determine the scope of

11

the exemption and not reach --

12

QUESTION:

Well, we would at least have to say

13

that the mere fact they have used the term instrumentality

14

is not sufficient to overcome the statutory argument.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, where there is

16

express tax-exempt language given by Congress.

17

even in McCulloch itself the Court said that it was up to

18

Congress to decide how it wanted to exercise its powers

19

under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

I mean,

So is it your principal submission

that we should look at the act in its pre-1985 status?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, we think that the '85

23

language which is present here is, in and of itself,

24

sufficient, but it is also supported by the history of the

25

statutory evolution from 1933, which makes perfectly clear
18

1

Congress did not intend for these entities to be tax-

2

exempt when the Government did not own shares in them.

3
4

If the Court has no further questions, I have
nothing further.

5

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Frederick.

6

Mr. Hanson, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. HANSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

QUESTION:

Your opponent said that your client

10

continued to pay taxes to the State of Missouri from,

11

what, 1985 to 1995, is that correct?

12

MR. HANSON:

Perhaps I could clear that up, Your

13

Honor.

In the first place, the bank was not formed until

14

1989, so that we obviously didn't have any liability prior

15

to that date.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. HANSON:

How about from 1989 to 1995?
The bank did, in fact, pay tax, and

18

fairly promptly, beginning with the year 1991 filed refund

19

claims to recover that tax.

20

extent that they were slow in making those claims, it

21

might have had something to do with the fact that the

22

entire farm credit system had more serious problems to

23

worry about in the late 1980's which was, frankly, its

24

survival.

25

I would submit that to the

One point that all parties seem to agree upon,
19

1

and certainly the Court's opinions make this clear, is

2

that the question of whether or not an entity is entitled

3

to immunity as a Federal instrumentality is up to

4

Congress.

5

Missouri said that in their briefs, the Solicitor General,

6

of course, said the same thing.

7

The Court said that in the New Mexico, the --

What we now have here, we would submit, is a

8

case where congressional designation as a Federal

9

instrumentality somehow carries less weight than a

10

judicial determination of Federal instrumentality.

11

QUESTION:

Well, the question is was there

12

really any congressional determination, considering that

13

when one thing we know for sure from '68 to '85, Congress

14

meant these entities to be subject to income tax, and they

15

were.

16

from clear.

17

What happened in '85?

MR. HANSON:

What Congress meant is far

Well, let me go through the history

18

briefly of the banks for cooperatives, because I think

19

that answers your question.

20

that time, if you look at decisions like James v. Dravo

21

Corporation, to be a Federal instrumentality meant -- and

22

I don't think there would have been any dispute, that you

23

were exempt from Federal income tax absent an affirmative

24

authorization.

25

was then in 1971 completely recodified and Congress again

They were formed in 1933.

At

The banks were, and the Farm Credit Act

20

1

affirmatively, not merely carry-over, but affirmatively

2

said, the bakns for cooperatives are -- continue to be

3

federally-chartered instrumentalities of the United

4

States.

5

Federal Government owned no stock in that entity, and they

6

said the resaon --

7
8
9

That's 1971.

QUESTION:

They did that at a time when the

But there was still a provision for

the Government to come back and use -MR. HANSON:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HANSON:

To invest in the stock.
Yes.
What changed in 1985 is that the

12

form of potential Government investment changed, and it

13

changed not because of some sense of a difference in the

14

structure of these entities, it changed because Congress

15

determined that a centralized entity, the Farm Credit

16

Capital Corporation, could serve a number of warehousing

17

and centralized financing functions, and it would then

18

become the entry point for Federal investment.

19

So what we have is, in effect, instead of the

20

money going directly to the bank for cooperatives, it

21

would go to the Capital Corporation, which would then

22

provide it to the banks for cooperatives, and I would

23

submit that that's --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HANSON:

The infusion would be a loan type -It would be a loan, and if you look
21

1

at the statute, it's a subordinated loan.

2

subordinated to all of the debt of the system.

3

subordinated to the capital provided by the members.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HANSON:

It's
It's

It's still not up -It's still not equity, I would

6

agree, but if you -- I mean, if you were trying to value

7

the debt versus the equity and compare their security and

8

their claims on the assets, I think you would find that

9

there very little distinction.

10

QUESTION:

You only tax the income-earned

11

equity, don't you?

12

bank is -- the income goes to the equity holder, doesn't

13

it?

14

I mean, basically the income of the

MR. HANSON:

The income goes -- the income of

15

the bank is used for four purposes, and these are provided

16

in the statute.

17

this in the context of 1991, which is the first year

18

before the Court.

19

of the bank, because you can't function as a lender

20

without capital to provide security to your bond holders.

21

The first purpose is to -- and I'll do

The first use is to rebuild the capital

The second use -- and this is all set out in

22

section 2132 with respect to BC's.

The second use is to

23

rebuild loss reserves, or to make sure that loss reserves

24

are adequate.

25

for the bank to function.

These are both things that are necessary

22

1

The third use, of course, in these years is to

2

pay back the Government loan and, as we indicated in our

3

brief, the Bank for Cooperatives National Bank and its

4

successor, CoBank, paid back something like $300 million.

5

None of those things actually affect earnings.

6

QUESTION:

No, but I mean, my point is simply,

7

if I own your bank -- you might be very nice -- I would

8

expect the State to tax the income, but if the Government

9

owns the bank, probably it wouldn't, and that's what the

10

statute seemed to say.

QUESTION:

What was the fourth purpose?

You

said there were four -- four things that -MR. HANSON:

The fourth would be, and this is

because we are a cooperative, would be a distribution to
23

1

our member borrowers according to the business they did

2

with the bank, not according to their capital, and as this

3

Court pointed out in Kiowa County, the purpose for that

4

distribution is not a purpose to return an investment to

5

the borrower.

6

because one of the fundamental missions of the farm credit

7

system, again as this Court has recognized, is to provide

8

loans for farmers at the lowest possible cost.

9

It's to reduce the cost of his loan,

QUESTION:

If your client had never been

10

financed by the Federal Government, the fact that it had

11

those priorities for distribution wouldn't entitle it to

12

any sort of a tax exemption, would it?

MR. HANSON:

No, but I think they make the point

14

that the bank itself is not a for-profit entity.

15

cooperative.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

It is a

Why does that bear on its tax

immunity?
MR. HANSON:

Well, it bears on why Congress

19

would give the bank a designation as a federally-chartered

20

instrumentality of the United States.

21

farm credit system -- it's set out in the statute, it's

22

been recognized in your cases, is to provide secure and

23

adequate lending to agricultural borrowers at the lowest

24

possible cost.

25

QUESTION:

The mission of the

All right, but the lowest possible
24

1

cost argument would not have washed before the '85

2

amendment, because before the '85 amendment it was very --

3

as I understand the statute it was very explicit.

4

even though you could reduce the cost by rendering the

5

bank nontaxable, you would only -- or the bank's income,

6

you would only do that if the United States was in part an

7

owner.

8

MR. HANSON:

QUESTION:

That

Right.
And once the United States dropped

10

out, we didn't care whether it made the loans more

expensive.

13

become -- why did Congress become more sensitive to cheap

14

loans after '85 than before?

15

Why would there be a different policy in

MR. HANSON:

Why did we

Well, I don't think Congress was

16

any less sensitive.

If you go back to 1933, when the

17

banks were formed, it was obviously the Depression, and

18

Congress did what the Court acknowledges that it does.

19

balanced the interests of a Federal program to provide

20

secure and adequate and inexpensive financing to farmers

21

with the fact that the States were also suffering from the

22

Depression, and so the compromise that was struck in

23

Depression conditions was, you can't tax these entities as

24

long as there's a Federal investment, but we will let you

25

tax them when that investment is retired.
25

It

1

As Missouri itself put it in its brief, they

2

said, you know, if the Federal Government has an

3

investment in the bank -- an investment here cannot

4

realistically turn on whether it is equity or debt.

5

mean, in either case, as I suggested earlier, the terms

6

are such that it's a Federal claim.

7

ought to be understood to have to stand aside until that's

8

paid back.

9
10

They said the States

What changed in 1985 is, Congress recapitalized
the system.

11

QUESTION:

Okay, but Congress was saying before

before the State interest.

policy.

Yes.
That isn't necessarily a cheap loan

It's a favor-the-United States policy.
After 1985, the United States says, we're not

18

going to be owners any more.

19

to favor the United States, and therefore there's no need

20

to provide a nontaxable policy.

21

and after '85, the United States' policy with respect to

22

the effect of the cost of borrowing on borrowers, on this

23

analysis, would be exactly the same.

24

MR. HANSON:

25

QUESTION:

Therefore, there's no need

At each time, before '85

Right.
The only thing that's changed is, we
26

1

don't have the United States in an equity position to

2

favor any more, therefore there's no need to provide for

3

nontaxability.

4

MR. HANSON:

Well, I mean, certainly there's

5

nothing in the legislative history that suggests that that

6

analysis was undertaken.

7

might not have thought it through that way, but going back

8

to what Justice Breyer was asking me about the profits and

9

income of a bank, there is no source to pay back the

11

QUESTION:

No, my question is actually the same

12

as Justice Souter's, that --

13

QUESTION:

No, go ahead.

14

QUESTION:

I'm probably just going to put it in

15

a slightly different way, but -- you have three sentences

16

in this statute.

17

MR. HANSON:

18

QUESTION:

Right.
The first sentence that says no, no

19

tax on bonds, all right.

20

when we're -- the Government's an investor.

QUESTION:

The second said, no tax on

Right.
All right.

Now, just out of

24

curiosity, let's suppose that was still the statute.

25

We're back in '84.

Why can the State tax a bank's income

even where the Government doesn't have an investment?

MR. HANSON:

QUESTION:

I apologize, Your Honor.
That's -- the point is, the statute

doesn't say, it can't.

9

The statute nowhere says that it

What the statute says is, it can't as

10

long as the Government has an interest.

11

what happens when the Government interest disappears.

12

it says is that the preceding sentence exemption doesn't

13

apply when the Government interest disappears.

14

what my version says.

15

the preceding sentence shall apply only when the

16

Government is an owner.

It doesn't say

21

Why doesn't McCulloch apply?

Now the Government isn't

Therefore the preceding sentence doesn't apply.

22

MR. HANSON:

23

legislative history from 1933 --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HANSON:

Well, and the answer is that the

Fine.
-- makes it very clear.
28

1

QUESTION:

2

negative implication.

3

MR. HANSON:

What you're saying, there's a

4

That Congress was very clear about

that.

5

QUESTION:

Fine.

Now, once you say there was a

6

negative implication before, why doesn't that same

7

negative implication exist after '85, from the first

8

sentence, unless there's something in that '85 history

9

that shows that what they wanted to do was restore

10

McCulloch, and my reading is there isn't a word on that,

11

but you're prepared to say it wasn't the statute before

12

that wiped out McCulloch.

13

You're saying what wiped out McCulloch before

14

was a negative implication from the statute, and so my

15

question is simply, why isn't that negative implication

16

still there, just as strong as it ever was, unless, of

17

course, you can point to a reason?

18

you see where I'm going?

19

MR. HANSON:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Now do you see my --

I understand where you're going.
Yes.

That's what I'd like the answer

to.
MR. HANSON:

Well, and let me qualify part of my

23

answer, is that the statute has been understood by -- it's

24

never been construed by this Court, but it's been

25

understood by a number of State courts and -- consistent
29

1

with what Congress said.

2

with that third sentence is, not that we -- we won't tell

3

you what happens when there's no ownership, but we are

4

telling you affirmatively that you become taxable.

5

They said, what we are writing

Now, was it artful language?

Perhaps not.

So I

6

don't think it's fair to say that the exemption -- that

7

the taxability previously existed by negative implication.

8

I think it was statutory and, of course, the answer, what

9

happened in 1985 was, the statute was repealed.

10
11

Now, both

the exemption, I agree, and the negative implication.
One thing here that I think the Court needs to

12

focus on, and it's a major point made by the State and by

13

the Solicitor General, is they -- citing Rosello and cases

14

like that, they say, well, the farm credit banks have an

15

exemption, and the farm -- the Federal land bank

16

associations have an exemption, and you don't have an

17

exemption therefore, and I grant that that's a perfectly

18

valid rule of statutory construction.

19

But I think it's fair to say that someone ought

20

to at least offer a reason why it makes sense that

21

Congress would discriminate against -- differentiate.

22

They're not discriminating -- differentiate between a bank

23

for cooperatives which makes loans to an agricultural

24

cooperative or production credit association which makes a

25

loan to a farmer.

It's also a property, but it's
30

1

otherwise identical, and a Federal land bank association

2

makes the same loan, and they've clearly granted a

3

statutory exemption in the one case but not the other.

4

Now, you know --

5

QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't that text take care

6

of it?

If you take the position that there's no inherent

7

exemption for this kind of organization, that you have

8

three organizations, and for two of them Congress has

9

provided expressly your income is exempt, and for one of

10

them it hasn't, so why isn't the assumption just from the

11

text that two of them have it and one of them doesn't?

12

MR. HANSON:

Well, I mean, I think Congress is

13

normally presumed to legislate on a rational basis and

14

have a reason for what it's doing.

15

particularly from --

16
17

QUESTION:

My point is, and

I thought in the tax area Congress

could shed its grace where it will.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. HANSON:

Well, I certainly agree with Your

20

Honor on that point, but 1985 -- and there is this change,

21

and we pointed it out in our brief, that when the banks

22

formed in 1933 and through 1971, in effect they were a

23

stand-alone element in the farm credit system.

24

issued their own bonds.

25

were liable only for their own bonds and for their own

They

They made their own loans.

31

They

1

operations.

2

From 1975 through 1985 the entire system became

3

interlocking in terms of issuance of bonds and liability

4

therefore, and the operation of all the banks, so --

5
6

QUESTION:

You say the entire system.

What are

you referring to?

7

MR. HANSON:

Well, I'm talking about the major

8

legs of the farm credit system, the -- what were

9

originally the Federal land banks and are now the farm

10

credit banks, the production credit associations, and the

11

banks for cooperatives.

12

lenders.

13

Those have always been the three

But in 1985 CoBank is -- or, National Bank for

14

Cooperatives -- I'm sorry, 1989 -- is no longer simply

15

liable for its own operations.

16

bonds.

17

affects everybody else, because if Missouri can tax it, it

18

has less income to put into the pool to pay back the

19

Government.

It doesn't issue its own

Its taxability doesn't affect only it.

20

QUESTION:

Now it

That's all true, but are there some

21

other kinds of banks that are very similar that Missouri

22

can't tax?

23

related kind of bank that Missouri cannot tax?

You're not saying there's some other very

24

MR. HANSON:

25

QUESTION:

I don't believe so.
No.
32

1

MR. HANSON:

I mean, the national banks, which,

2

of course, have always been viewed and designated as

3

Federal instrumentalities, the statute now tells you what

4

to do.

5

in the first place they're not designated as federally-

6

chartered instrumentalities.

7

QUESTION:

The other types of lending institutions, you know,

Again --

Well, isn't the obvious answer to

8

your question, what -- you say, well, the Government's

9

thought was, while we're the owner, Missouri can't tax us,

10

but once we're no longer the owner, because we don't own

11

stock, then it can, and if that raises the price of

12

credit, so be it.

13

to say.

14

I mean, isn't -- that's what it seems

MR. HANSON:

Well, then I guess I would --

15

that's one way of looking at it, but it seems frankly

16

implausible to me.

I mean --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HANSON:

19

What about the other two --- because the Government -- I'm

sorry, Justice Scalia.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HANSON:

I thought you were done.

Finish it.

The Government -- and again,

22

this -- part of the problem that we have with this is, we

23

recognize that there were distinctions made between the

24

banks.

25

capitalized --

The Federal land banks, which were originally

33

1

QUESTION:

It seems implausible -- you were

finishing your answer.

3

because?

4

MR. HANSON:

It seems implausible to you

That Congress would make that

determination with respect to the banks for cooperatives,

6

but it wouldn't make that determination with respect to

7

the other banks.

10

QUESTION:
question.

Are the other banks -- this was my

Does the Government own stock in the other

ones?

11

MR. HANSON:

It does not own stock in the other

12

banks.

It originally capitalized the Federal land banks,

13

which had been before this Court numerous times.

14

QUESTION:

So you could not explain the

15

difference on the ground that the Government is a

16

participating investor in the others --

17

MR. HANSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

But --

No, and --- in a formal sense, whereas it is

not here.

20

MR. HANSON:

Those statutes -- their statutory

21

exemption continued after the Government's stock was

22

retired.

23

cooperatives exemption was, as it appears to us, because

24

when the banks were formed in 1933, that was a political

25

calculation that Congress made.

It was not made conditional, as the banks for

34

They said, the States are

1

desperate for revenue, and while we need to accomplish

2

this program, we're willing to make this accommodation.

3
4

QUESTION:
for 35 years.

5
6

But the accommodation didn't kick in

MR. HANSON:

That's right.

until the late 1960's, and that accommodation --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HANSON:

9

It did not kick in

Kind of one-sided compromise.
Well -- I mean, partly that goes to

the nature of farming.

You offered to buy the bank, and I

10

suspect I have members who would happily sell it to you.

11

But --

12

QUESTION:

But it does show the Government was

13

willing to treat CoBank differently then, and there's no

14

resaon to believe tht Government isn't willing to treat it

15

differently now, just as then you say the other

16

instrumentalities, even though the Government was no

17

longer a participating investor, would continue to have

18

their exemption, that was not the case for CoBank.

19

MR. HANSON:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

That's correct.
So it's always been treated

differently for -MR. HANSON:

There is that differentiation.

But

23

it comes -- it all comes down to 1985, and did Congress

24

change the rules, and we suggest that the law before 1985

25

was, we are exempt as long as the Federal Government has
35

1

an investment, and technically in the stock of the bank,

2

and I understand that.

3

In 1985, Congress says, we have to provide a

4

line of credit to this entire system to keep it from

5

falling.

6

capital it had accumulated over 7 years.

7

It managed in 2 years to lose 40 percent of the

And not only are we going to do that, but we're

8

going to make the whole thing interlocking in terms of how

9

it functions, and we're doing all of this because the bank

10

is critical, because the commercial banks will not lend to

11

agriculture in times of stress -- Congress said that in

12

1633 in '87 -- and because the farmers are suffering from

13

interest rates that they have to pay to the farm credit

14

system, which in large part was a function of the cost of

15

borrowing in the capital markets, because the capital

16

markets had lost confidence in the banks, so we had --

17

QUESTION:

Congress said all this in a technical

18

and conforming amendment, but nothing to suggest that they

19

meant to do anything more than get rid of the obsolete

20

provision that referred to the Government's ownership.

21

MR. HANSON:

Well, you know, the State has

22

suggested that that is the reference in the committee

23

report which describes this change, and we would submit

24

that's not true for two reasons.

25

First, as we pointed out in our brief, the
36

1

committee report refers to a version of the bill which did

2

not, in fact, establish -- it did not, in fact, repeal the

3

second sentence.

4

understand that's a two-edged sword, but they say it's

5

only a technical and conforming amendment when what

6

Congress was doing was repealing only the third sentence

7

of the act, which would leave us with a complete

8

exemption, so I don't know that you can prove too much --

9

I don't know if I'm being clear about that.

10

It repealed only the third.

QUESTION:

I

But what puzzles me is if the tax,

11

the State tax was on from '68 to '85.

12

saying, stop, States, you would expect that to be

13

something that people would stand up and take notice of,

14

and yet there's not anything explicit to suggest that

15

Congress meant to take away from the States the tax

16

authority that they had for this and the -- what is it,

17

the PCA's as well?

18

MR. HANSON:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

If Congress was

Yes, it was, basically.
That it meant to take that away from

the States.
MR. HANSON:

Well, I think there are two answers

22

to that, and first is, as we've pointed out, you know,

23

this legislation started out, as legislation does, with

24

hearings and worrying about governmental regulation, and

25

farmers complaining about the cost of borrowing, and by
37

1

the time it got into the system in November, the question

2

was whether or not you could save the farm credit system,

3

because it turned out that it was basically hemorrhaging

4

money.

5

And Congress, the bill was introduced on, I

6

think, the 20th of November, and it was signed by the

7

President on the 18th of December.

8

bang, bang, bang.

9

Journal as legislating on the fly.

10

I mean, this went,

It was described in the Wall Sreet
They were, you know,

as the Wall Street Journal would be very offended by that.

11

But -- so you have -- you have a lot of very

12

high priority concerns that Congress was trying to deal

13

with and articulate and explain, and then you've got this

14

State tax exemption which I'm -- and liability, which is

15

clearly important to Missouri, I've no doubt about that,

16

but on a list of priorities, I doubt that it was very high

17

when Congress was concerned -- as the comments on the

18

floor indicate, they're worried about losing the entire

19

system, and -- but I think the second point, and again, in

20

19 -- I know I'm repeating about this point, but in 19 --

21

prior to the change, the statute said that the bank was

22

exempt as long as the Federal Government owned stock in

23

the bank.

24
25

After 1985, if you accept our interpretation, we
are saying that the bank is exempt because the Federal
38

1

Government has reinfused capital, admittedly in a

2

different form, but certainly not financially,

3

economically different, and in a form for which the banks

4

were liable, so that I would submit that the only

5

difference between the circumstances in 1984 and 1986, if

6

you will, is that in the first place Congress was being

7

explicit, and in the second place Congress was relying

8

upon --

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. HANSON:

11

QUESTION:

If you look at --- that designation.
I mean, that's why -- not everyone

12

agrees, but I like to look at legislative history, and you

13

would have expected, given -- even cooperative banks at

14

that time, they'd have lawyers who were doing this, and if

15

they thought that in removing words that grant an

16

exemption the intent was to give an even bigger exemption,

17

I would certainly think somewhere somebody would have said

18

something.

19

MR. HANSON:

Well, I don't understand, and

20

I've -- we've never accepted this notion that somehow we

21

have a bigger exemption.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HANSON:

No, equal to.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but -- well,

24

not even equal, because previously we were exempt from

25

Federal income tax.

Subsequently we're not exempt from
39

1

Federal income taxes, and in -- I mean, and that's fairly

2

significant.

3

Now, you can say, well, doesn't that undercut

4

the notion of lending at the lowest possible cost?

The

5

answer is, I think the Government is sort of indifferent

6

whether it gets its money -- in paying back the loan

7

whether it gets its money from taxes or gets a loan

8

repayment, and in fact the banks were never truly exempt

9

from Federal tax because they were -- even when they were

10

exempt from Federal income tax the statute imposed a

11

franchise tax based on net earnings, which is functionally

12

equivalent, so in that sense the status quo was

13

maintained, and I think that's our argument.

14

The status quo was maintained.

The design was

15

maintained.

16

circumstances, and given the pressure Congress was under,

17

I think it's entirely rational that they would look at

18

this -- I mean, the bill came out of the House on the 6th

19

of December.

20

by both Houses on the 10th.

21

The facts changed, and under the

It was passed, completely changed and passed

I think it's -- you know, it's asking a bit much

22

to expect a nice, detailed explication of all the

23

provisions.

24
25

QUESTION:

Could you go to the reason for the

tax, the Federal income taxability?
40

Is it taxable under a

1

special statute that says, CoBank, pay Federal income

2

taxes now, or is it taxable simply because there's no

3

express exemption for CoBank?

4

MR. HANSON:

It is -- it's taxable because the

5

Internal Revenue Code provides that it would be taxable

6

absent an express exemption, and there is none, so it's --

7

entities have always been subject to --

8
9

QUESTION:
this bank?

10
11

Does the code refer specifically to

MR. HANSON:

No.

The code refers to Federal

instrumentalities and tells you how to --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HANSON:

Okay.
-- that they are exempt -- I'm

14

sorry, that they are taxable absent an express exemption

15

in the income tax law.

16

It's 501(c)(1).

So -- you know, so the presumption, the pattern

17

is opposite for a Federal tax.

18

there's a statutory exemption.

19

You're taxable unless

Here, and I'd like to simply conclude by where I

20

started.

If you look at the New Mexico decision which

21

Missouri relies upon at length, and you go to page 736,

22

and I pick this out -- this is illustrative.

23

talking about whether those particular Federal contractors

24

were exempt from State tax, and you said, the Court's

25

other cases describing the nature of a, quote, Federal
41

You were

1

instrumentality.

2

That is a term of art.

It's been a term of art

3

since Justice Marshall first coined it in McCulloch v.

4

Maryland, and the one attribute that's always been

5

associated with a Federal instrumentality in this Court's

6

cases is an exemption from State taxation absent a waiver.

7

I mean, I've looked -- I can't claim that I -- this is

8

complete.

9

The Court has never held that an entity which is

10

a Federal instrumetnality is taxable in the absence of an

11

affirmative congressional authorization, whether you're

12

talking about the Department of Employment, you're talking

13

about New Mexico, you're talking about Graves, you're

14

talking about James v. Dravo, never, at least not that we

15

can find.

16

That term carries with it that attribute, and we

17

submit that Congress, in designating us a federally-

18

chartered instrumentality, consistent with what we do --

19

they didn't do it haphazardly -- intended precisely the

20

same designation, and we would suggest that that also fits

21

with the overall goals of Congress in passing the 1985 act

22

and rescuing the farm credit system and trying to give the

23

agricultural borrowers some relief from high interest

24

rates.

25

It seems to us it all fits together, and what
42

1

the State is literally saying is, well, we want to act

2

like the law didn't change, that there was no repeal.

3

Well, there was a repeal.

4

question is, did Congress intend that we become taxable

5

without regard to the Federal investment, or did they

6

intend that we become exempt under the McCulloch rule, and

7

those are basically the choices facing the Court.

The law did change, and the

8

If there are no further questions --

QUESTION:

MR. HANSON:

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Hanson.

Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Layton, you have 7 minutes

13

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. LAYTON:

I'll note first that I believe that

16

the banks for cooperatives were subject to Federal income

17

tax prior to 1985, but I'd also note the franchise tax

18

that counsel referred to.

19

In the 1971 act in section 4 it sets out a

20

franchise act that could be as high as 25 percent of net

21

income for the banks, but interestingly, that franchise

22

tax applied so long as the Government holds shares in the

23

bank, and that the Government didn't hold any shares at

24

that point, and there was obviously an incentive, given

25

that franchise tax, not to allow the Government to pick up
43

1
2

any shares in your particular bank.
I should note also that although the National

3

Bank for Cooperatives was formed in 1989, it was the

4

merger of other banks for cooperatives, and there have

5

been banks for cooperatives operating in Missouri for

6

many, many years prior to 1989.

7

Turning to the legislative history, if, indeed,

8

we have to get to the legislative history, the history

9

does talk about the reasons for the 1985 act, and one of

10

the things that's there is a note that the banks for

11

cooperatives themselves were healthy.

12

prompted by a problem with the banks for cooperatives.

13

was prompted, as Mr. Hanson accurately said, by a system-

14

wide problem.

This was not
It

15

That is, there may have been -- there were other

16

entities within the bank, the farm credit system that were

17

having enough problem that it was bringing down the

18

ability of the entire system to sell bonds, and yet the

19

argument being made here is that because some other entity

20

had a problem and Congress created a system-wide remedy,

21

that is a remedy that would provide Federal financing to

22

the system as a whole, and never to particular

23

institutions, that somehow these banks for cooperatives

24

attained a new exemption.

25

Before, they only had an exemption when they had
44

1

Federal investment.

2

all have an exemption even if no one has a Federal

3

investment, and the most that's likely is that some

4

production credit association or someone else would have

5

an investment, and yet somehow they get this exemption

6

back.

7

Afterward, according to CoBank, they

They also -- the -QUESTION:

Mr. Frederick, what is the effect of

8

Congress' calling an institution a Federal

9

instrumentality?

I'd always thought that the primary

10

reason they do that is precisely to exempt it from State

11

income tax.

12

MR. LAYTON:

13

QUESTION:

Well -What other effect does it have?

Why

14

would you enact a statute that says, you know, the Red

15

Cross, or whatever it is, is a Federal instrumentality?

16

MR. LAYTON:

I think one reason is to ensure

17

that that entity -- in the tax context one reason is to

18

ensure that that entity cannot be subjected to

19

discriminatory taxation.

20

Missouri, for example, could not pass a tax that

21

was restricted to the income of federally charter -- or,

22

excuse me, of cooperative banks that serve cooperatives,

23

farm cooperatives.

24

this instrumentality, that would be aimed at a Federal

25

instrumentality and would be a discriminatory tax and it

Because the only one that exists is

45

1

would be illegal, becuse that is a Federal

2

instrumentality.

3

certainly that is one impact of use of that term.

4

There may be other reasons as well, but

The change that is alleged to have come about in

5

1985 is not just to remove the connection between the

6

Federal investment and the bank that is asserting the

7

exemption, but also to remove the temporal aspect.

8

is, before, the exemption only was in place while the

9

Federal investment was in place.

That

10

At the time in 1985 there was 5-year sunset

11

provision on the credit corporation through which the

12

funds that Mr. Hanson spoke of would be channeled, and yet

13

the exemption that he asserts is one that would exist

14

indefinitely.

15

history and with the language of the statute.

16

CoBank poses the question as to why

That's inconsistent with the legislative

17

differentiate between production credit associations and

18

banks for cooperatives on the one hand and other

19

institutions such as land banks on the other, and we

20

shouldn't have to ask that question, because Congress made

21

that determination in 1933.

22

distinction.

23

distinction now is.

24
25

There has always been a

We're just discussing today what the

But there are a couple of possible reasons for
Congress to have made that distinction.
46

One is simply

1

temporal.

In 1933 we were in the Depression era, and not

2

only was there a problem with the farm credit, with credit

3

for farmers, but there was a problem with banks generally,

4

and so here Congress was setting up some institutions that

5

would compete with commercial banks that themselves were

6

failing throughout rural areas in the United States, and

7

Congress set up a system that said, okay, for the time

8

being, we will give you an advantage over your commercial

9

competitors, but only for the time being.

At some point

10

it's going to go back to where you do not have that extent

11

of commercial advantage.

12

obligations that will be tax-free, but you won't be able

13

to avoid tax entirely.

Sure, you can still issue

14

Another reason that there may be a distinction

15

is that the land banks that Mr. Hanson referred to lend,

16

as I understand it, based on the farmer's land as

17

collateral, and there has always been a feeling in

18

Congress that we don't want to take the land away from the

19

farmers.

20

lending based on their crops, which is what a production

21

credit association would do, or based on the equipment and

22

land that is held by a cooperative that may be producing

23

or processing the crops or otherwise providing services

24

for the farmers.

25

That is distinguishable from the question of

There is a distinction.

It's worth noting that today betwen two-thirds
47

1

and three-quarters of agricultural lending in the United

2

States is done by entities outside of the farm credit

3

system, and those entities must compete on the grounds

4

that Congress set forth, and not on the grounds that can

5

be divined by some reference to past history.
