CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Wolfson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Congress brought Federal judges within the

11

coverage of the Social Security and Medicare programs,

12

they began to share with the vast majority of all other

13

Americans the costs and benefits of a universal program of

14

social insurance that benefits society at large.

15

obligation to participate in those programs posed no

16

threat to the central purpose of the Compensation Clause,

17

which is to protect the judiciary from interference from

18

the other political branches.

19

The

As this Court recognized in O'Malley v.

20

Woodruff, judges are also citizens, and the Compensation

21

Clause does not grant them an immunity from participating

22

in the burden of Government, whose Constitution and laws

23

they are charged with administering.

24
25

A nondiscriminatory tax that falls on judges as
well as most other citizens does not violate the

Compensation Clause.

2

with Congress' possibly abusing its power to set judges'

3

statutory salaries does not apply to Congress' application

4

and extension of a nondiscriminatory tax on income.

5

The concern that the Framers had

Now, the Framers understood that when Congress

6

exercised its authority to enact statutory salaries, it

7

would have the opportunity for mischief.

8

QUESTION:

Excuse me, how does that

9

nondiscriminatory get into it?

Suppose Congress simply

10

reduces the salaries of all Federal employees, officers

11

and employees, and judges among them.

12

that it was nondiscriminatory wouldn't prevent it from

13

violating the Compensation Clause, would it?

14

MR. WOLFSON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Surely the fact

That is correct, Justice Scalia.

Although you could say they're

clearly not trying to impair the independence of judges.
MR. WOLFSON:

That's the holding, of course, of

18

Will, which is that a nondiscriminatory reduction in

19

Federal employees' salaries that includes judges does

20

violate the Compensation Clause, but it's one thing to say

21

that a direct reduction of judges' salaries violates the

22

plain language of the clause, because it is, after all, a

23

diminution of their compensation that is owed to them for

24

their services, but it's another thing -- and -- but it's

25

another thing to say that a tax, which is not a direct

1

reduction of their compensation but is an obligation that

2

they must share with all other citizens, implicates the

3

Compensation Clause.

4

QUESTION:

Why is that, because a tax doesn't

5

have anything to do with their compensation, and therefore

6

it doesn't count?

7

the Compensation Clause, then?

Why would a discriminatory tax violate

8

MR. WOLFSON:

9

QUESTION:

First of all, I think --

If it doesn't have anything to do

10

with compensation, you could do it discriminatorily, I

11

assume.

12

MR. WOLFSON:

I'm not sure it would violate the

13

Compensation Clause itself.

14

fundamental principles underlying Article III, a

15

discriminatory tax, even if it didn't fall on judges'

16

compensation.

17

It very likely would violate

If -- one -- there are two, essentially two

18

different principles here.

19

compensation, and another is discriminatory treatment of

20

judges in some way which might or might not be directed at

21

their salary or at their income.

22

principles would apply, a discriminatory tax principle

23

would apply if Congress --

1

the Compensation Clause and decided them one way or the

2

other, but what cases support this second line of

3

argument?

4

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think the

5

cases like Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm show that there are

6

broader principles protecting the independence of the

7

judiciary that go beyond some political interference, that

8

go beyond just the Compensation Clause, but I want to add,

9

even if I'm wrong, and even if one should analyze the

10

discriminatory tax on judges' salaries under the

11

Compensation Clause, that doesn't mean one would have to

12

also conclude that a nondiscriminatory tax violates the

13

Compensation Clause, because the clause would still be

14

interpreted in light of its central purpose, which is to

15

protect judges from interference with their function by

16

the political branches.

17

Now --

18

QUESTION:

Well, but maybe -- you call it a

19

central purpose, but it's not the only purpose, and it's

20

clear that another purpose is to enable those who come to

21

the bench, setting aside a lucrative profession, to be

22

able to be sure that they will get so much money over the

23

term of their lifetime service.

24

one of the purposes.

You acknowledge that's

I certainly acknowledge that that

it's -- I think it's --

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I'm not sure that I agree

that that is a central purpose of the Compensation Clause.

6
7

A purpose.

QUESTION:

You disagree with Alexander Hamilton,

then?
MR. WOLFSON:

But I -- Hamilton said that that

9

would certainly be a benefit of the clause, but I think

10

that even if that's -- even if that's so, and even if I

11

agree with you, it doesn't necessarily follow -- it

12

doesn't follow, in fact, that every expectation that a

13

judge had, that he brought with him, or her, when taking

14

office, was protected from any disparagement or any

15

adverse effect by later action in Congress.

16

After all, the same claim was made in Will.

The

17

judges argued that the formula for adjusting the statutory

18

salary had been built into the statute at the time they

19

took the judges, and they fully expected that those

20

adjustments in salaries would come automatically each

21

year, and yet Congress in 2 years prevented those salaries

22

from taking effect.

23

QUESTION:

But there, it was because they had

24

not yet become effective, and therefore they were not part

25

of the compensation that the judges had -7

1

MR. WOLFSON:

But the broader point is that it

2

just is not the case that every single expectation that a

3

judge has about his financial position when he takes

4

office is something that the Compensation Clause freezes

5

in place.

6

For example, Congress surely could have raised

7

the rate of the general applicable income tax on all

8

citizens in the exact same amount as was the amount of the

9

Medicare and Social Security taxes in this case, and

10

Congress could have done so, in fact, because it had

11

decided that from this point on these programs of social

12

insurance should be financed out of general income tax

13

revenues instead of a separate tax on income.

14

QUESTION:

Perhaps, but is it fair to equate

15

payments into a retirement system with general taxes?

16

mean, when employers offer compensation, they offer a

17

compensation package, which very often includes retirement

18

plans.

19

noncontributory, but that is part of the whole scheme of

20

compensation, and it may well be the case that the general

21

taxes are something entirely different, but does that

22

necessarily show that contributions to retirement schemes

23

are entirely different?

24

involving the compensation of the judges?

2

contribution to a retirement scheme, but it also is

principally a tax that is laid on the wages and salaries

of every earner.

QUESTION:

It's quite -- it's actually quite

QUESTION:

Right --

-- a fraction of what you paid in.

11

get the whole deal, and pay 60 years and get nothing more.

12

MR. WOLFSON:

The -- not only that, but there's

13

both a floor and a ceiling in Social Security benefits.

14

Congress has also made clear by statute that it can adjust

15

Social Security benefits, and that there are no

contractual or vested rights in a particular level of

benefit, so --

QUESTION:

This was meant to replace for these

5

judges the Civil Service retirement system, wasn't it,

6

which they previously had been entitled to participate in?

7

MR. WOLFSON:

Actually, no.

The judges -- the

8

judges themselves, while judges, did not participate in

9

the Civil Service retirement system.

Now, Federal

10

employees did participate in an entirely separate, self-

11

contained system, CSRS, and Congress did not bring

12

incumbent Federal employees into Social Security on a

13

mandatory basis.

QUESTION:

Congress replaced that element of

QUESTION:

Why is the contributory versus

whether you contribute to it or not, or whether, you know,

14

somehow it is tied to your wages or not?

15

it's part of the total employment package.

16

Does it make a difference, when an employer

MR. WOLFSON:

It seems to me

Well, first, the question here is

17

not whether judges' Social Security benefits are part of

18

their compensation.

19

presenting here is whether Congress could ask judges, or

20

could require judges to participate in the financing of a

21

system that operates for the benefit of society at large,

22

and that is the obligation that was extended to judges for

23

the first time in 1983 and 1984.

1

the concerns that the Framers had with diminishing direct

2

reductions of statutory salary don't apply here, is that

3

when Congress enacts and shapes a general tax like Social

4

Security, it legislates with the broad perspective of

5

society at large, and it doesn't have a narrow focus on

6

the judiciary, and when Congress sets the generally

7

applicable tax rate, it is also constrained by political

8

checks, by the popular political objection to --

9

QUESTION:

But you could say that Congress did

10

have a focus on the judiciary here, since judges weren't

11

included until 1983, and then it was decided to bring

12

judges in, who had not been in before.

it's true Congress brought judges -- Congress eliminated

1

the step of extending it or not extending it to this very

2

discrete group of individuals, judges, you're confronted

3

with the problem that they may be induced to extend it or

4

not to extend it on the basis of whether they like judges

5

or not, on the basis of whether they think these judges

6

have been coming out with decisions of the sort they like

7

or not.

8
9

Once you allow Congress, whether it's part of a
step-by-step proceeding or not, to single out judges for

10

an imposition of this sort, you run the risk that, you

11

know, that they're doing it for a wrong reason, and we

12

can't inquire case-by-case whether they did it because

13

they were mad at judges or not.

14

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, first of all, there is no

15

claim in this case that Congress did this for that reason,

16

that Congress extended the coverage of the programs to

17

judges.

18

QUESTION:

I don't know how you'd find that out,

19

to tell you the truth.

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, second, this isn't -- excuse

me.

MR. WOLFSON:

A couple of million, all right.

11

As -- if there were 2 million, let's say, 1,950,000 it

didn't apply to, because there it was just for the future.

As to the remaining 50,000, there were probably

less, probably 5,000, maybe 2,000, it did apply to them,

right, which is that in the first place one has to

2

remember that close situation of employees of the

3

legislative branch and Members of Congress, who before

4

1984 were not mandatorily covered by either CSRS or Social

5

Security, and they were required, as of '84, basically to

6

choose one, and so they were in roughly the same situation

as Federal judges, which is that beforehand they were not

first question is, is that really a bona fide tax of any

Then the second question, even if one gets that

point, the second question is, is there a legitimate

reason, or not?

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Breyer, I agree that when

Congress treats judges for tax purposes differently than

other people who are similarly situated, it has to have a

significant reason for doing so, but I would say two

things.

2

the -- the attendant benefits of the coverage that I

3

discussed earlier to them as well as everybody else, as

that that is a significant reason for tax equal -- for

treating judges for tax purposes equally, as all other

citizens.

11

Now, the hypothetical that you gave me is not
tax equalization.

I mean, it's -- it is imposing a

special tax on judges.
So that, I think is -- I think that is almost

12

always, perhaps always, a legitimate objective of

13

Congress, which is to treat judges equally with all other

14

citizens for tax purposes, because the Constitution does

15

not require Congress to grant judges a perpetual exemption

16

from taxes.

17

recognize that when judges take office with a particular

18

salary, that they cannot reduce that level of salary.

What it does require Congress to do is to

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, do I understand your

20

argument to be essentially, this is no different than if

21

Congress had initially given Federal judges an exemption

22

from income tax, and they enjoy that exemption -- say, a

23

judge when he took office got that exemption.

24

later, the Congress decides that judges shouldn't be

exempt from the Federal income tax, so puts it on.

you mentioned is basically the case that was decided by

the Fourth Circuit in Baker v. Commissioner, after this

Chief Justice Stone sat, it raised the situation that

after this Court's decision in Miles against Graham,

is that they give him something that isn't poison, but

that is very addictive, and then withhold it from him, and

can do the same thing with Federal judges.

7

QUESTION:

You're saying that you

You cannot put a new tax just on

8

judges, but when they come in, you can say, hey, guys,

9

we're going to give all of you a special tax exemption,

10

and if you behave yourselves, you can keep that tax

11

exemption, but you get us mad, and you're not going to

12

have that special exemption any more.

13

that that's okay?

14

MR. WOLFSON:

You really think

Justice Scalia, I think the

15

problem with analyzing it that way is that there's no

16

question that Congress could have raised everybody's

17

income taxes in the exact same amount that it raised

18

judges, that it was equal to the Medicare and Social

19

Security taxes in these cases.

20

So judges did not have any expectation -- if

21

they came into office at the salary of $100,000 and the

22

income tax rate was 30 percent, there's no question, or it

23

isn't disputed in this case, I don't think, that Congress

24

could have raised the general income tax on everybody 5,

25

10 percent.

2

Not only that, Congress could have imposed what

3

it has called from time to time a surtax, which is, you

4

know, a special kind of tax that is found necessary to

5

impose from time to time.

6

Now, that has the exact same economic effect as

7

a -- as the elimination of the 5.4 -- the exemption for

8

the 5.4 percent for Social Security taxes and the Medicare

9

tax, so I think it's just wrong to say that the judges had

10

an enforceable entitlement that required Congress to

11

freeze this in place, because their economic situation

12

could have been changed in exactly the same way.

13

QUESTION:

Isn't the reason that judges were

14

distinguished from some other categories in this general

15

revision of the Federal retirement system, isn't one of

16

the reasons that they had a guaranteed retirement income,

17

and that was the basis for narrowing the focus to judges?

18

Do you think that's a fair basis for saying, well, since

19

you have this retirement income, which the Constitution

20

guarantees you, we're going to use that guaranteed income

21

as the basis for treating you differently from other

22

people?

say that Congress realized that if it was -- if it

talking about the old age tax here.

2

3

completely nondiscriminatory, but as for the OASDI tax, if

4

Congress had required incumbent Federal employees to pay

5

that, they would have been subject to double deductions,

6

and Congress realized that that in itself was unfair.

7

That is, it would be required to treat alike things that

8

were not, in fact, alike, so the fact that judges had the

guaranteed retirement annuity was a difference for

QUESTION:

What authority in our cases is there

for either of those, Mr. Rosenthal?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, with respect to the

6

discrimination, the latter, virtually every one of these

7

cases, especially the Woodrow case, refers to a

8

nondiscriminatory tax.

9

With respect to the issue of the tradeoff, the

10

tradeoff is derived from both Will and Evans, which refer

11

to the fact that one of the primary purposes, an equal

12

purpose of the clause, was to bring judges -- bring

13

qualified judges into the judiciary.

14

Hamilton, one of the purposes of the clause was to get

15

people with the requisite knowledge, combined with the

16

requisite integrity.

17

indicated in Federalist 78.

18

To quote Alexander

That was a primary purpose, as he

Therefore, the purpose was so that -- and I'm

19

again quoting Hamilton.

It was so that a man knew what

20

ground he stood on, and the ground that these judges stood

21

on was, they didn't get -- they got a lot of

22

disadvantages, Your Honors, from when they became Federal

23

judges, but one of the small advantages they did get was,

24

all of the plaintiffs were free from OASDI and HI, and

25

that was retroactively changed.

QUESTION:

So would you say on that reasoning

that when the Social Security tax came in and everybody in

the general population was exposed to it, and the judges

MR. ROSENTHAL:

That is contrary to what the SG just

said, because the SG just said there are also some people

in Congress.

8
9

Now, who are those people?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, there was a theoretical

possibility that you had not been in CSRS before, and the

10

Government for the first time in the reply brief raised

11

this issue.

12

I've done some inquiries, and I am informed that

13

that set of people who did not elect CSRS is either very

14

few or none at all, and the reason for that is, it was

15

almost irrational not to elect CSRS because it's

16

refundable, so if you were a youngster who was just out of

elect CSRS because 2 years later you can get the money

back.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

It's very small, Your Honor.

3

But of the 2-1/2 -- of the 2-1/2 million, we're talking

4

about, a number in the three digits or the low four

5

digits.

6

The fact is -- and that is the basis of our

7

discrimination argument, and I would point out that the

8

election that was given was not just given once, it was

9

given three times, so if you were fool enough to miss it

10

the first time, you were given a number of opportunities

11

to opt out of the deduction from your salary, and that is

12

the basis for our discrimination argument.

13

The Government says, oh, we have a rationale for

14

discrimination, and that is equalization.

15

that, number 1, this Court's decision in the Will case

16

said, equalization can't justify a diminution, because the

17

Government made the same argument in Will.

18

we lowered Federal judges' salaries, but we were lowering

19

all Federal employees' salaries at the same time, and this

20

Court said, equalization can't be a rationale.

21

I would answer

They said, oh,

But secondly, the fact is that it doesn't take a

22

very creative legislature to come up with some reasonably

Is there any evidence in the

admissible in this case, that there was a discriminatory

intent?

15

MR. ROSENTHAL:

No, and this Court has never

No, that's quite true, but I mean,

We're

1

saying, well, this isn't so clearly literally within the

2

core of the Compensation Clause, and maybe one of our --

3

maybe our principle criterion ought to be to determine

4

whether this is also prohibited, since it gets away from

5

the core, is a discrimination criterion, was it used to

6

discriminate for purposes of cowing the judges and so on,

7

so the fact that in the core case we didn't look to it

8

doesn't mean that we shouldn't look to it here.

9

MR. ROSENTHAL:

If I could suggest a case which

10

I think is quite analogous, and that's Davis v. Michigan

11

Department of Revenue.

12

As the Court may recall, that was a case in

13

which State employees were exempted -- State retirees were

14

exempted from a tax on their retirement benefits.

employees and the rest of the Michigan public had to pay

income taxes on retirement benefits.

was discriminatory.

QUESTION:

This Court held,

There was no intent to discriminate

than discriminatory as a matter of intent.

you are saying.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I think that is what we're

saying, and obviously the penny -- I mean, if there were a

penny drop in stated salary, that obviously would be

unconstitutional, but we infer the intent from the facts.

QUESTION:

Well, if we get outside the

Compensation Clause, several recent congressional pay

10

raises in 1989 gave district judges a higher percentage

pay raise than court of appeals judges, court of appeals

12

judges a higher percentage pay raise than Supreme Court

maybe Congress had it in for the Supreme Court?

There was a

reduction in take-home pay, so we're dealing here with a

reduction in take-home pay, and the question in this case

is, was it an unconstitutional reduction?

So we distinguish it from cases where there are

different levels of increase, where, frankly, political

factors do play a role, but that was a decision made by

a much greater role than with a decrease, where a

Congress has a choice.

Either it taxes -- it gives no

exemption, it can never take it away, so it's got to treat

judges -- it can't give them preferential treatment, in

it's stuck with that, but you --

12

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, that's correct, Your

Honor.

Congress next year, instead of providing an increase in

15

stated salaries, said, all judges can take $10,000 tax-

free, $10,000 of their income is tax-free.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I resist it because exemption

I think if there were at least one directed to judges, if

there were an exemption, that might be interpreted to be

an increase in --

You wouldn't say, as I understand

your argument -- I don't understand why you wouldn't --

10

that if everybody in the country had a $10,000 exemption,

your first $10,000 is for free, okay, and then they took

it away for the whole country, is it your contention that

system, which had been in place since 1920, and that it

6

would be extremely disruptive just to terminate it and

7

start as if it had never existed, especially because many

8

Federal employees would not have been able to accrue

9

enough service in Social Security after that point to

10

become eligible in Social Security, especially if they

11

were older.

12

system allows retirement at age 55.

13

The Federal -- the Civil Service retirement

It also is more expensive on the cost side for

14

Federal employees than Social Security in some sense,

15

because the contribution rate is higher, and there was no

16

earnings cap on Social Security -- on CSRS, as there was

17

under the old age tax system, so all of those factors had

18

to be balanced.

19

The point is, at the end of the day, Federal

20

judges joined virtually everybody else in our society in

21

being subject to a 5, 6 percent mandatory contribution for

22

a retirement income security system, and that's what I

23

mean when I say that the overall objective of Congress was

24

equalization, and that Congress treated them no

25

differently at the end of the day than it treated

everybody else.

Now, it is true, there are issues that come up

3

in a transition, as there are any time when Congress

4

extended Social Security, or where a State might adjust --

5

a State might adjust an exemption, for example, the

6

intragovernmental tax immunity system doctrine was alluded

7

to.

9

Well, there was a time when States exempted all
Federal employees and Federal contractors from their taxes

10

because they thought they were required to under this

11

Court's decisions in Collector v. Day.

12

Graves, and the Court said that States could tax Federal

13

employees and Federal contractors on an equal rate.

14

States were required to adjust their systems, or had the

15

opportunity to adjust their systems, and they were able to

16

do so in many different ways.

17

Then along came

The

It required some -- it required a lot of

18

adjustment because of the ways that different people had

19

been treated differently, and this Court has many cases on

20

that point, reviewing the adjustments that the States

21

made, but the point is, the principle that emerged from

22

those cases was, what was required at the end of the day

23

was nondiscriminatory taxation of those who dealt with the

24

Federal Government, and that principle we think is the

25

same principle that should govern here.

That is, at the

end of the day, Congress is required to do more than treat

2

Federal judges on par with the vast majority of American

3

citizens.

4

I do want to touch on the termination of

5

violation point, which is, even if we're wrong about

6

everything that I just said, it seems to me the only

7

expectation that judges could have had when they took

8

office was that their net pay would not have been reduced

9

below the level at which they took office.

10

So the expectation -- the expectation that

11

judges had was not that they remain exempt from Social

12

Security taxes in a kind of indefinite number that is

13

just, they have an interest in an exemption, quia

14

exemption, but a particular number has to be put on that,

15

so if a violation did occur, the violation came to an end

16

when Congress brought judges' net pay back up above the

17

highest level that it had ever been at any earlier time.

18

If the Court has nothing further --

19

QUESTION:

Well, yes, as long as you're at it,

20

the part that was bothering me was not the part, treating

21

judges the same.

22

differently.

23

differently in that everybody else is allowed to opt out

24

but judges.

25

It was the part of treating judges

So what -- I mean, they're treated

Now --

MR. WOLFSON:

Well -50

QUESTION:

2

They weren't angry.

3

It's just that they thought judges already have this

4

pension plan, which is perfect.

5

But that only applied --

6

-- the reason is clear, I guess.
They didn't dislike our opinions.

MR. WOLFSON:

That's why they did it.

It's not just that judges had the

7

pension plan.

8

anything and everybody else had to pay something.

9

Federal employees also had to pay something, so they were

10

It's also that judges didn't have to pay

Thank you.
