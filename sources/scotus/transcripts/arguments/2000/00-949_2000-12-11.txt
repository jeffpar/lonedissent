ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. OLSON:

Mr.

Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it please the Court:
Just one week ago, this Court vacated the

14

Florida Supreme Court's November 21 revision of Florida's

15

election code, which had changed statutory deadlines,

16

severely limited the discretion of the State's chief

17

election officer, changed the meaning of words such as

18

shall and may into shall not and may not, and authorized

19

extensive standardless and unequal manual ballot recounts

20

in selected Florida counties.

21

Just four days later, without a single reference

22

to this Court's December 4 ruling, the Florida Supreme

23

Court issued a new, wholesale post-election revision of

24

Florida's election law.

25

Florida election law yet again, it also explicitly

That decision not only changed

3

1

referred to, relied upon, and expanded its November 21

2

judgment that this Court had made into a nullity.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson --

4

QUESTION:

Can you begin by telling us our

5

federal jurisdiction, where is the federal question here?

6

MR. OLSON:

The federal question arises out of

7

the fact that the Florida Supreme Court was violating

8

Article II, section 1 of the Constitution, and it was

9

conducting itself in violation of section 5 of Title III

10

of federal law.

11

QUESTION:

On the first, it seems to me

12

essential to the republican theory of government that the

13

constitutions of the United States and the states are the

14

basic charter, and to say that the legislature of the

15

state is unmoored from its own constitution and it can't

16

use its courts, and it can't use its executive agency,

17

even you, your side, concedes it can use the state

18

agencies, it seems to me a holding which has grave

19

implications for our republican theory of government.

20

MR. OLSON:

Justice Kennedy, the Constitution

21

specifically vested the authority to determine the manner

22

of the appointment of the electors in state legislatures.

23

Legislatures, of course can use the executive branch in

24

the states, and it may use in its discretion the judicial

25

branch.
4

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. OLSON:

Then why didn't it do that here?
It did not do that here because it

3

did not specify

-- it did use the executive branch.

In

4

fact, it vested considerable authority in the Secretary of

5

State, designating the Secretary of State as the chief

6

elections official, and as we point out, the very first

7

provision in the election code requires the Secretary of

8

State to assure uniformity and consistency in the

9

application and enforcement of the election law.

The

10

Secretary of State as the executive branch is also given

11

considerably

12

but -- and to a certain extent, especially in connection

13

with the contest phase of the election, certain authority

14

was explicitly vested in the Circuit Court of the State of

15

Florida, which is the trial court.

16

-- considerable other responsibilities, when

QUESTION:

Oh, but you think then there is no

17

appellate review in the Supreme Court of what a circuit

18

court does?

19
20
21

MR. OLSON:

Certainly the legislature did not

have to provide appellate review.
QUESTION:

Well, but it seemed apparently to

22

just include selection of electors in the general election

23

law provisions.

24

in together somehow.

25

MR. OLSON:

It assumed that they would all be lumped
They didn't break it out.
Well, there are
5

-- there is a

1

breakout with respect to various aspects of Florida

2

statute and Florida election law.

3

grant of authority to the circuit courts.

4

reference to an appellate jurisdiction.

5

most powerful argument we bring to this Court.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. OLSON:

There is no
It may not be the

I think that's right.
Because notwithstanding,

8

notwithstanding

9

Constitution may have been invoked.

10

There is a specific

-- well, the fact is that the

QUESTION:

Well, this is serious business

11

because it indicates how unmoored, untethered the

12

legislature is from the constitution of its own state, and

13

it makes every state law issue a federal question.

14

you use this theory and say that it creates some sort of

15

presumption of validity that allows us to see whether this

16

court or the executive has gone too far?

17

you're arguing?

18

MR. OLSON:

Can

Is that what

No, I would say this with respect

19

-- it would have been a perfectly logical, and if you read

20

the statutes, a perfectly logical, especially in the

21

context of a presidential election, to stop this process

22

at the circuit court, and not provide layers of appeal

23

because given the time deadline, especially in the context

24

of this election, the way it's played out, there is not

25

time for an appellate court.
6

1

QUESTION:

I have the same problem Justice

2

Kennedy does, apparently, which is, I would have thought

3

you could say that Article II certainly creates a

4

presumption that the scheme the legislature has set out

5

will be followed even by judicial review in election

6

matters, and that 3 U.S. code section 5 likewise suggests

7

that it may inform the reading of statutes crafted by the

8

legislature so as to avoid having the law changed after

9

the election.

And I would have thought that that would be

10

sufficient rather than to raise an appropriate federal

11

question, rather than to say there's no judicial review

12

here in Florida.

13

MR. OLSON:

I think that I don't disagree with

14

that except to the extent that I think that the argument

15

we presented and amplified on in our briefs is a good

16

argument, it's a solid argument.

17

the way the code is set up, and it's particularly

18

consistent with the timetable that's available in a

19

presidential election.

20

QUESTION:

However

It is consistent with

--.

Well, it's pretty close.

You can say

21

it could be interpreted that way by the Florida Supreme

22

Court, I suppose.

23

that even in close calls we have to revisit the Florida

24

Supreme Court's opinion?

25

You think it must be?

MR. OLSON:

Or is your point

No, I think that it is particularly
7

1

in this case where there's been two wholesale revisions,

2

major restructuring of the Florida Election Code, we don't

3

even get close to that question at all.

4

unfortunate to assume that the legislature devolved this

5

authority on its judiciary sub silentio.

6

specific reference to it.

7

pointed out, especially the decision of last Friday, there

8

was a major overhaul in almost every conceivable way.

9

QUESTION:

Mr.

It would be

There is no

But in this case, as we have

Olson, as I understand your

10

argument, you rely on Leser v. Garnett and Hawke v. Smith,

11

and is it critical to your Article II argument that we

12

read the word legislature as narrowly, I mean the power

13

granted the legislature as similar to that granted in

14

Article V of the Constitution, as those cases dealt with?

15

MR. OLSON:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20
21
22

No, I don't think it's necessary.
So your reliance on

-- you really

are not relying on those cases.
MR. OLSON:

Well, I think those cases support

the argument, but as we said
QUESTION:

--.

But if you've got to choose one

version of the word legislature or the other
MR. OLSON:

--.

I think in a different context, it's

23

not necessarily the case, and certainly it is true that

24

legislatures can employ the legislative process that might

25

include vetoes by a state chief executive, or a
8

1

referendum, when the state deliberately chooses to choose

2

a legislative method to articulate a code.

3

think that's most important and most

4

QUESTION:

The point I

--.

But is it the choice of the

5

legislature or was it constitutionally limited to this

6

provision?

7

Is it your theory, in other words, that they voluntarily

8

did not permit appellate review of the lower courts in

9

these election contests or that Article II prohibited them

10

I'm a little unclear on what your theory is.

from allowing it?

11

MR. OLSON:

No, Article II

-- we do not contend

12

that Article II would prohibit them from fulfilling that

13

process.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Of course Article V would have, and

under Leser against Garnett and those cases, but you
MR. OLSON:

--.

In the context of this case we're

17

saying that they can include the judicial branch when they

18

wish to do so, but under no circumstances is it consistent

19

with the concept of the plan in the Constitution for the

20

state, sub siletio, the state legislature sub silentio to

21

turn over to the judiciary the power to completely

22

reverse, revise, and change the election code in all of

23

the major respects

24
25

QUESTION:

--.
Mr.

Olson, with respect to the role

of judicial review, you rely very much on the McPherson
9

1

case, and two things strike me about that case.

2

if you're right on your jurisdiction theory, then should

3

not this Court have vacated instead of affirmed the

4

decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in that case

5

because the Michigan legislature didn't confer upon the

6

Michigan Supreme Court in that case any special authority

7

of judicial review?

8
9

MR. OLSON:

One is,

That's entirely possible that that

might be the case, Justice Ginsburg, but the entire text

10

of the McPherson decision and its recitation of the

11

legislative history or the history of legislation and acts

12

by state legislatures to comply with it make it quite

13

clear that the power is vested in the legislature itself.

14

QUESTION:

15

reviewing, which we affirmed.

16

theory as I see it, there was no role for the Michigan

17

Supreme Court to play because Article II, section 1 gives

18

the authority exclusively to the legislature, and the

19

legislature has not provided for judicial review

20

especially for that measure.

21

MR OLSON:

But there was a decision by the court
Under your jurisdiction

I think the context of that case is

22

different, and that it's entirely possible for the Court

23

to have come to the conclusion it did in that case and we

24

believe that case is compelling for the principle that we

25

are arguing in this case, that there is no, the entire
10

1

structure of what Florida did, its election code, in its

2

effort to comply not only with Article II, but with

3

Section 5 of Title 3, is such that it did not intend in

4

any way to divest itself of the power to determine how the

5

appointment of electors would be determined in a federal

6

presidential election and most importantly, the resolution

7

of cases and controversies, and disputes, with respect to

8

the appointments

9

--.

QUESTION:

Three times, at least as I counted in

10

McPherson itself, it refers to what is done by the

11

legislative power under state constitutions as they exist.

12

This is not the most clearly written opinion, and yet

13

three times, they refer to the legislative power as

14

constrained by the state's constitution.

15

MR. OLSON:

And I think that that's important.

16

I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg.

17

clearly written opinion.

18

of that case, the relationship of the legislature to the

19

Constitution in that case and the way that power was

20

exercised, that ought to be reconciled with what we are

21

urging the Court today, that a wholesale revision and

22

abandonment of the legislative authority can't be turned

23

over, especially sub silentio, by a legislature simply

24

because there is a constitution.

25

It's not the most

But I think that in the context

There is a constitution in every state.
11

There

1

is a judiciary in every state.

2

certain functions in every state, and to go that length,

3

one would assume that the judiciary in every state under

4

that argument could overturn, rewrite, revise, and change

5

the election law in presidential elections notwithstanding

6

Article II, at will.

7
8

The judiciary performs

Now, this was a major, major revision that took
place on Friday.

9

QUESTION:

Mr.

Olson, isn't that one of the

10

issues in the case as to whether it was a major revision?

11

Your opponents disagree, and I know you rely very heavily

12

on the dissenting opinion in the Florida Supreme Court,

13

but which opinion do we normally look to for issues of

14

state law?

15

MR. OLSON:

Well, I think that the dissenting

16

opinion and the two dissenting opinions are very

17

informative.

18

one looks at, for example, the recount provisions, before

19

this revision under Florida law, manual recount under the

20

protest provisions were discretionary, completely

21

discretionary, conducted by canvassing boards during the

22

protest phase of the election, post-election period,

23

pursuant to legislatively defined procedures as to who

24

could be present, for seven days after the election with

25

respect to all ballots in a county, that was mandatory and

We are relying on what the court did.

12

If

1

only available, as we heard last week, for tabulation

2

error up until this election.

3

After the decision of December 8th in this

4

context, those remand provisions, I mean those recount,

5

manual recount provisions became mandatory instead of

6

discretionary pursuant to judicial rather than executive

7

supervsion during the contest phase rather than the

8

protest phase, even though it's not even mentioned in the

9

statute with respect to the contest phase, pursuant to ad

10

hoc judicially established procedures rather than the

11

procedures that are articulated quite carefully in the

12

statute.

13

QUESTION:

Well, on ad hoc judicially created

14

procedures, the point of subsection 8 of 168.

15

once we get into the contest phase, subsection 8 gives at

16

least to the circuit court, leaving aside the question of

17

appellate jurisdiction, about as broad a grant to fashion

18

orders as I can imagine going into a statute.

19

MR. OLSON:

I mean,

Well, to read that, to read that

20

provision and it's written quite broadly, but to read

21

that, one has to read that in the context of the entire

22

statutory framework.

23

Supreme Court did, the entire process is tilted on its

24

head.

25

election officials, it now becomes in the court.

If one reads it the way the Florida

the protest phase, where the standards should be lower

window.

process that exists are there and one has to -- .

The time tables are thrown out the window.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. OLSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

there.

What's the timetable in 168?
There is no timetable.
That's right.

There is no timetable

So that seems to undercut your timetable argument

10

once you get into the contest phase from the protest

11

phase.

12

The

MR. OLSON:

But that's only if you untether 168

13

entirely from the statute and the steam by which the

14

protest phase takes place over a period of seven to 10

15

days in the context of this election, and the contest

16

phase occurs over the next four weeks.

17

QUESTION:

It may well be and I'll grant you for

18

the sake of argument that there would be a sound

19

interpretive theory that in effect would coordinate these

20

two statutes, 166 and 168, in a way that the Florida

21

Supreme Court has not done.

22

Florida Supreme Court statutory construction and unless

23

you can convince us, it seems to me, that in construing

24

168, which is what we are concerned with now, and its

25

coordination or lack of coordination with 166, the Florida

But that's a question of

14

1

Supreme Court has simply passed the bounds of legitimate

2

statutory construction, then I don't see how we can find

3

an Article II violation here.

4

MR. OLSON:

Well, I am hoping to convince you

5

that they passed far beyond the normal limits of statutory

6

construction.

7

The changing of the meaning

QUESTION:

-- .

You have convinced us certainly that

8

there is a disagreement about how it should be construed,

9

and that disagreement is articulated by the dissents in

10

the most recent case.

11

cross the line into saying that this has simply become a

12

nonjudicial act.

13

construction, but I don't see it as a nonjudicial act.

14
15

But I don't quite see where you

It may or may not be good statutory

MR. OLSON:

It is, it is, we submit an utter

revision of the timetables, the allocation.

16

QUESTION:

17

there is no timetable in 166.

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

But Mr.

Olson, we're back to the --

That's correct.
And what your argument boils down to,

20

I think, is that they have insufficiently considered 168,

21

I'm sorry, that they have insufficiently considered 166 in

22

construing 168, and you may be right, but you have no

23

textual hook in 168 to say untethered timetables imply in

24

effect a nonjudicial act.

25

MR. OLSON:

We are not just saying timetables.
15

1

We are saying that it has wrenched it completely out of

2

the election code which the legislature very carefully

3

crafted to fit together and work in an interrelated

4

fashion.

5

there are timetables which are very important in a

6

presidential election, we are today smack up against a

7

very important deadline, and we are in the process where

8

-- .

9

It isn't just the timetable.

QUESTION:

Yes, you are.

The fact that

But that is a deadline

10

set by a safe harbor statute for the guidance of Congress

11

and it's a deadline that has nothing to do with any text

12

in 168.

13

MR. OLSON:

Well, I believe that the Supreme

14

Court of Florida certainly thought that it was construing,

15

it certainly said so this time, that it was construing the

16

applicability of Section 5 and it was expressing the hope

17

that what it was doing was not risking or jeopardizing the

18

conclusive effect -- .

19
20
21

QUESTION:

And it took that into consideration

in fashioning its orders under subsection 8.
MR. OLSON:

And we submit that it incorrectly

22

interpreted and construed federal law in doing that

23

because what they have inevitably done is provide a

24

process whereby it is virtually impossible, if not

25

completely impossible, and I think it is completely
16

1

impossible, to have these issues resolved and the

2

controversies resolved in time for that federal statutory

3

deadline.

4

the process has changed.

5

Furthermore, it is quite clear, we submit, that

QUESTION:

Well, if your concern was with

6

impossibility, why didn't you let the process run instead

7

of asking for a stay?

8

MR. OLSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. OLSON:

Well, because we said -- .
We'd find out.
Because we argued, and I believe

11

that there is a very firm basis for saying that that

12

process already had violated Article II of the

13

Constitution.

14

compliance with Section 5 of Title 3 because the laws had

15

been changed in a number of different respects and we have

16

recited them.

17

It was also already throwing in jeopardy

The timetables are important.

QUESTION:

Oh, and I thought your point was that

18

the process is being conducted in violation of the Equal

19

Protection Clause and it is standardless.

20

And the Due Process Clause, and what we know is now the

21

new system that was set forth and articulated last -- .

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. OLSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

In respect to that

MR. OLSON:

--.

Pardon me?
In respect to that, if it were to

start up again, if it were totally hypothetically, and you
17

1

were counting just undercounts, I understand that you

2

think that the system that's set up now is very unfair

3

because it's different standards in different places.

4

What in your opinion would be a fair standard, on the

5

assumption that it starts up missing the 12th deadline but

6

before the 18th?

7

MR. OLSON:

Well, one fair standard, and I don't

8

know the complete answer to that, is that there would be a

9

uniform way of evaluating the manner in which

10

was Palm Beach, for example

11

QUESTION:

--.

All right, a uniform way of

12

evaluating.

What would the standard be, because this is

not good enough.

Well, the standard -- .

We want -- .
And what in your opinion would be the

19

most commonly used in the 33 states or whatever, or in

20

your opinion, the fairest uniform substandard?

MR. OLSON:

Well, certainly at minimum, Justice

22

Breyer, the penetration of the ballot card would be

required.

discussed in conjunction with the December

But we submit in the context of the

Now, the intent of the voter

Olson

It would be a complete change.
It is also part of your case, is it

10

not, that insofar as that language just quoted is

11

concerned, the power of the circuit judge to prevent or

correct any alleged wrong, it's part of your submission, I

think, that there is no wrong when a machine does not

14

count those ballots that it's not supposed to count?

15

17

MR. OLSON:

That's absolutely correct, Justice

Scalia.
QUESTION:

The voters are instructed to detach

18

the chads entirely, and the machine, as predicted, does

19

not count those chads where those instructions are not

20

followed, there isn't any wrong.

21

MR. OLSON:

That's correct, they've been

22

euphemistically

-- this has been euphemistically referred

23

to as legal votes that haven't been counted.

24

ballots where the system created by Florida, both with

25

respect to the initial tabulation and the preferred system
24

These are

1

for the recount, the automatic recount in close elections,

2

is to submit those ballots to the same mechanical

3

objective scrutiny that the initial count was done, and

4

those were not counted either because there were votes for

5

more than one candidate, which would make them overvotes,

6

I guess they're calling them, or that they read as no

7

vote, which many people do, many people do not vote in the

8

presidential election even though they're voting for other

9

offices.

10

QUESTION:

But as to the undervotes, and as to

11

the undervotes in which there is arguably some expression

12

of intent on the ballot that the machine didn't pick up,

13

the majority of the Florida Supreme Court says you're

14

wrong.

15

They interpreted the statute otherwise.
Are you saying here that their interpretation

16

was so far unreasonable in defining legal vote as not to

17

be a judicial act entitled, in effect, to the presumption

18

of reasonable interpretation under Article II?

19

MR. OLSON:

Yes, that is our contention, and

20

that has to be done.

contest provisions.

QUESTION:

Mr.

Olson, is it critical to your

position that the Florida Supreme Court erred in its

opinion?

MR. OLSON:

20

QUESTION:

--.

Is it critical to your position,

because you're tying the two cases together, that the

Florida Supreme Court made that kind of error in its

resolution of the conflict between shall and may in the

24

disparate statute?

25

MR. OLSON:

I don't think it's critical.
26

What

1

we're saying is that the court expanded upon its previous

decision that was vacated in this case, it used the time

Mr.

Klock, will you address Justice

Breyer's question of a moment ago, if there were to be a

15

uniform standard laid down, I suppose at this point by the

16

Leon County Circuit Court or in any other valid way in

17

your judgment, what should the substantive standard be?

18

MR. KLOCK:

I'll try to answer that question.

19

You would start, I would believe, with the requirements

20

that the voter has when they go into the booth.

21

would be a standard to start with.

22

the polling place and then when they walk into the booth

23

that what you are supposed to do with respect to the punch

24

cards is put the ballot in, punch your selections, take

25

the ballot out, and make sure there are no hanging pieces
28

That

about presumes that it's a legal vote no matter what you

do with the card.

5

out of the polling place and not stick it in the box and

6

they would consider that to be a legal vote.

that a legal vote at the very basics has to at least be

8

following the instructions that you are given and placing

9

the ballot in the box.

And presumably, you could take the card

QUESTION:

11

MR. KLOCK:

12

QUESTION:

The fact is

No, we're asking, I think --.
No.
Not what the Florida election law is

13

at this point in your opinion, but rather if under the

14

Equal Protection Clause, and I'm drawing on your

15

experience as a person familiar with elections across the

16

country.

You have looked into this.

17

MR. KLOCK:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
What would be a fair subsidiary

19

standard applied uniformly, were it to be applied

20

uniformly across all the counties of Florida, including

21

Broward, a fair uniform standard for undervotes.

22

Remember, Indiana has a statute, Michigan has a statute,

23

33 states have a statute where they just say intent of

24

voter, but in your opinion because of the hanging chad,

25

etc., etc., what is a fair, not necessarily Florida law,
29

1

but a fair uniform standard?

2

MR. KLOCK:

Without being disrespectful, Your

3

Honor, I think you have answered the question in terms of

4

phrasing the question.

5

schemes that you could select from if you were a

6

legislature, but as a court, I don't think that the

7

Supreme Court of Florida respectfully, or any other court

8

can sit down and write the standards that are going to be

9

applied.

10

There are any number of statutory

If you are a legislature --.
QUESTION:

But in your opinion, if you were

11

looking for a basically fair standard, to take one out of

12

a hat, Indiana, or Palm Beach 1990, in your opinion would

13

be a basically fair one?

14

MR. KLOCK:

If I were to take one out of a hat,

15

Your Honor, if I was a legislature, what I would do is I

16

would hold that you have to punch the chad through on a

17

ballot.

18

there are only indentations in every race, you might then

19

come up with a different standard, but the only problem

20

that we have here is created by people who did not follow

21

instructions.

22
23

In those situations where you have a ballot where

QUESTION:

Okay.

Can I ask you a different

question on Florida law?

24

MR. KLOCK:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And the question on Florida law is
30

1

simply this, what the statute is.

2

statute lists grounds for contesting, one of those grounds

3

is rejecting a sufficient number of legal votes sufficient

4

to place the election in doubt, and then the circuit judge

5

is given the power to investigate that allegation, just to

6

look into it.

7

MR. KLOCK:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11
12
13
14
15

Yes.

I take it the contest

There were no --.

So why would it be illegal under

Florida law to have a recount just to investigate whether
this allegation is or is not so?
MR. KLOCK:

The Justice's question assumes that

they are legal votes.
QUESTION:

There might be some in there that are

legal under anybody's standard.
MR. KLOCK:

Your Honor, if they are not

16

properly, if the ballot is not properly executed, it's not

17

a legal vote.

18

upon this in terms of a machine ballot is the Hogan case

19

from the Fourth District Court of Appeal.

20

District Court of Appeal, that candidate lost by three

21

votes, and he went during the protest phase to the

22

canvassing board and asked for a manual recount to be done

23

and they exercised their discretion and said no.

24

that case, there is a discussion.

25

that there were ballots in there that had hanging chads

The only case in Florida that even touches

31

In the Fourth

And in

He raised the argument

1

and this that and the other thing.

2

of it and when it went up on appeal, it was affirmed.

3

the fact of the matter is that the only case that we have

4

that deals with this handles it in that fashion, and I

5

would respectfully suggest that a ballot that is not

6

properly punched is not a legal ballot.

7

They would hear none
So

And I think also, sir, if you go through an

8

analysis of the Vice President's arguments in supporting

9

what the Supreme Court does, there is sort of an omelet

10

that is created by going and picking through different

11

statutes.

12

For instance, the clear intent standard comes

13

from a statute that deals with a damaged ballot where you

14

have to create, to put through the machine, a substitute

15

ballot, and there are very clear directions as to what to

16

do to preserve the integrity of the ballot.

17

Beckstrom case, which you will no doubt hear much about as

18

the argument proceeds, dealt with that kind of situation.

19

There was a manual recount there; the court did not pass

20

on the propriety of it.

21

officials took ballots and marked over the ballots instead

22

of creating a separate substitute ballot, they took that

23

ballot and marked it over so it could go through an

24

optical scanner, which the court found to be gross

25

negligence whether they would discount the votes.

And the

The issue was if the election

32

That

1

was the issue that was present there.

2

look through Florida law it is relatively clear that there

3

was no basis whatsoever to be able to find -- .

4

QUESTION:

So I think if you

Let me just ask this question.

If

5

you did have a situation, I know your position is

6

different, where there were some uncounted ballots due to

7

a machine malfunction, for example, would it not make

8

sense to assume that the standard used for damaged ballots

9

would be the same standard you use in that situation?

10

MR. KLOCK:

11

QUESTION:

12

I don't think so, sir.
What standard would you use in the

situation I propose, then?

13

MR. KLOCK:

Well, Justice Brennan, the

14

difficulty is that under -- I'm sorry.

15

tell you not to do that.

16
17

That's why they

The standard that is in 166 is in, is dealing
with the protest phase, and it was brought about in 1988.

18

QUESTION:

I understand, but my question is if

19

you don't use that standard, what standard would you use

20

for my hypothetical?

21

MR. KLOCK:

22
23

one, sir.

The legislature would have to create

I don't know what standard -- .
QUESTION:

You are saying that they can't

interpret a statute in which there is no explicit

25

definition.

QUESTION:

I'm Justice Souter -- you'd better

cut that out.

7

MR. KLOCK:

I will now give up.

What I'm

8

saying, sir, is this.

9

of using the word interpret to explain anything that a

10

court does.

11

baggage.

12

That you cannot be in a situation

The word interpret cannot carry that much

QUESTION:

But you go to the opposite extreme

13

and say, it seems to me, that they cannot look, as Justice

14

Stevens suggested, to a statute which deals with, and

15

certainly a closely analogous subject at a near stage, and

16

it seems to me that you in effect go to the opposite

17

extreme that you are excoriating the Florida Supreme Court

18

for and say they can't interpret at all.

19

MR. KLOCK:

I think what the Florida Supreme

20

Court should do in that instance is note the very tight

21

restrictions that exist under the protest phase.

22

require that you find voter intent with respect to a

23

damaged ballot.

That's correct.
Mr.

Klock -- I'm Scalia.

Yes, sir.

I remember that.

You

It will be hard to forget.

QESTION:

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I had

10

thought that although you don't take into account

11

improperly marked ballots for purposes of determining

12

whether there will be a manual recount, I had thought that

13

when there is a manual recount for some other reason, and

14

you come across ballots of this sort that you can count

15

them, that for that purpose you can decide oh, look at,

16

there is a hanging chad.

17

It's clear what the intent of the voter are.

18

it.

21
22

MR. KLOCK:
correct.

Yes.

Justice Scalia, that is

If you have a situation -- .
QUESTION:

It's correct if you use the intent of

the voter standard in that situation?

23

MR. KLOCK:

24

QUESTION:

25

We'll count

Is that not correct?

19
20

The machine didn't count it.

Pardon me, sir?
It's correct that you use the intent

of the voter situation, standard in that situation?
35

1

That's what I understand the answer to be.

2

MR. KLOCK:

It is correct that that statute

3

provides.

That I think that that statute, there could be

4

problems under it, but that statute was designed for a

5

very limited situation where there was a problem with the

6

mechanism of voting.

7

error and that is absolutely clear because otherwise, Your

8

Honor, what would occur is the following.

9

election that have you that was close, you would have an

It was not designed to handle voter

That in every

10

automatic recount and then irrespective of what the

11

canvassing board does, just load all the ballots together

12

and put them on a truck and send them to Tallahassee

13

because if there is no standard whatsoever and in any

14

election contest that you are unhappy with the election,

15

you can send the ballots to Tallahassee, then have you a

16

problem that is created that would not exist -- .

MR. BOIES: Yes.

The Supreme Court of Florida said

word, I assume it used it in a legal sense.

Why doesn't that constitute an acceptance by the

I think, Your Honor, and obviously

this Court and the Florida Supreme Court is the best

15

interpreter of that opinion, but I think a reasonable

16

interpretation of that opinion is to say that what the

17

Florida Supreme Court meant by cognizant is that it was

18

taking into account the desire to get the election over in

19

time so that everyone would have the advantage of the safe

20

harbor.

21

I think that goes throughout the opinion.

All right.

And it seems to me that if

have acted with reference to 3 USC

Except, Your Honor, what the Florida

10

Supreme Court did I think in its opinion is to say that in

11

terms of looking at how to remedy the situation, it needed

12

to be cognizant of the fact that there was this federal

13

deadline out there that was going to affect Florida's

14

electors if that deadline was not met.

15

QUESTION:

Well, of course the deadline is

16

meaningless if there's a new law involved.

17

the equation, too.

18

MR. BOIES:

That's part of

Yes, but what I would say is that

19

whether or not there is a new law, that is whether there's

20

a change in the enactment in the language of the statute

21

or the constitution, is something that has to be decided

22

in the initial instance by the Florida Supreme Court

23

interpreting Florida law.

25

QUESTION:

There really

-- Mr. Boies, there are

really two parts to that sentence of section 5 we're
38

1

talking about.

2

the other is finally determined six days before the date

3

for choosing the electors.

meant to acknowledge

generally, they must have acknowledged both of those

provisions.

MR. BOIES:

Do you think the Florida court

-- it seems to me since it's cited

I don't know exactly what was in the

8

Florida Supreme Court's mind, but I think that in general

9

what the Florida Supreme Court made quite clear is that

10

the thing that was constraining it was the desire to fit

11

its remedy within the safe harbor provision.

12
13

QUESTION:

So that's the finally determined

portion of section 5?

QUESTION:

--.

Let me ask, could the legislature of

19

the State of Florida, after this election, have enacted a

20

statute to change the contest period by truncating it by

21

19 days?

22

MR. BOIES:

23

QUESTION:

You mean by shortening it?
Without contravening the section

24

which says that there should be no new law for the safe

25

harbor?

Could the Florida Supreme Court have done what

1

the

supreme court did?

Consistently, because that would be a

new law under section 5, wouldn't it?
MR. BOIES:

Yes, because it would be a

legislative enactment as opposed to a judicial
interpretation of an existing law.
QUESTION:

Remember

--.

And in fact it would be a new law

under our pre-clearance jurisprudence, wouldn't it?
MR. BOIES:

I think not, Your Honor, because if

14

you go back to the State against Chappell in 1988, where

15

the Florida Supreme Court faced the very question of

16

whether or not that seven-day period was an iron curtain

17

that came down, the Florida Supreme Court said it was not.

18

The Florida Supreme Court said that you had to look as to

19

whether there was substantial compliance.

20

three days was found to be substantial compliance.

21

was a situation in which there was telephone notice, which

22

was not adequate for certification.

QUESTION:

But if we assume the legislature

would run contrary to the new law prohibition in the
40

statute, wouldn't the Supreme Court do it if it does

2

exactly the same thing?

3

MR. BOIES:

Except what I'm saying, Your Honor,

4

is that it wasn't doing exactly the same thing because it

5

wasn't passing a new law.

It was interpreting the

I'm not sure why

10

court does it, it isn't.

Both would have to require

11

you have to pre-clear judicial rulings and see whether

12

they make new laws, don't you?

13

MR. BOIES:

--

What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that

14

if the supreme court had rewritten the law the way you

15

hypothesized the legislature rewrote the law, it might

16

very well be a difference.

17

Florida Supreme Court did not rewrite the law in the way

18

that you hypothesized.

19

confronted with was a statute, and that statute said that

20

-- and it was the later passed statute, we get back into

21

the may and the shall.

22

What I'm saying is that the

What the Florida Supreme Court was

The may statute was the later passed statute,

23

and so what the Florida Supreme Court said is we have to

24

look at what is the criteria by which you decide whether

25

you may ignore and will ignore these returns, and what the
41

1

Florida Supreme Court said, we're going to interpret that

2

exactly the way we've interpreted it for 25 years, and 12

3

years before the Florida Supreme Court made this decision,

4

it had made the State against Chappell decision in which

5

it had approached it from exactly the same policy grounds.

6

QUESTION:

Well, it was quite a different

-- I

7

mean, there, indeed, telephone notification had been given

8

within the deadline, and the actual written material was

9

not submitted until a few days after.

I think that's

10

quite a bit different from extending the period generally

11

and for all submissions for, you know

12

-- I'm not sure that you and Justice Kennedy are

13

disagreeing on very much.

14

that if the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of this

15

law were not a reasonable interpretation, just not one

16

that would pass normal judicial muster, then it would be

17

just like the legislature writing a new law, but your

18

contention here is that this is a reasonable

19

interpretation of Florida law.

20

MR. BOIES:

-- but if I could

It seems to me you acknowledge

I think the way I would put it, Your

21

Honor, is that if you conclude that the Florida Supreme

22

Court's interpretation of Florida law is either a sham or

23

it is so misguided that it is simply untenable in any

24

sense

25

--.
QUESTION:

Right.
42

1

MR. BOIES:

I think at that point then you can

2

conclude that what it has done is it has changed the law,

3

but I think the standard is the standard this Court has

4

generally applied in giving deference to state supreme

5

court decisions.

6

QUESTION:

But is it in light of Article II?

7

I'm not so sure.

I mean, I would have thought that that

8

bears on the standard, frankly, when it contemplates that

9

it is plenary power in the legislature.

Does that not

10

mean that a court has to, in interpreting a legislative

11

act, give special deference to the legislature's choices

12

insofar as a presidential election is concerned?

13

think that is a tenable view anyway, and especially in

14

light also of the concerns about section 5.

15

MR. BOIES:

I would

I think, Your Honor, that if the

16

Florida Supreme Court in interpreting the Florida law, I

17

think the Court needs to take into account the fact that

18

the legislature does have this plenary power.

19

when the Florida Supreme Court does that, if it does so

20

within the normal ambit of judicial interpretation, that

21

is a subject for Florida's Supreme Court to take.

QUESTION:

You are responding as though there

23

were no special burden to show some deference to

legislative choices.

In this one context, not when courts

context of selection of presidential electors, isn't there

2

a big red flag up there, watch out?

3

MR. BOIES:

I think there is in a sense, Your

4

Honor, and I think the Florida Supreme Court was grappling

5

with that.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BOIES:

8

QUESTION:

9

And you think it did it properly?
I think it did do it properly.
That's, I think, a concern that we

have, and I did not find really a response by the Florida

10

Supreme Court to this Court's remand in the case a week

11

ago.

12

all those changes and deadlines were just fine and they

13

would go ahead and adhere to them, and I found that

14

troublesome.

15

It just seemed to kind of bypass it and assume that

MR. BOIES:

Your Honor, if I could, one of the

16

things that was argued from the beginning by

17

Governor Bush's counsel and accepted by the Florida

18

Supreme Court was that the protest statute and the contest

19

statute were very separate procedures.

20

limit in the protest contest prior to certification, but

21

there is no time limit in the contest statute process,

22

which is what we are in now, and I think that the Florida

23

Supreme Court was focusing on this contest period, which

24

is what is really before, was before them and is before

25

you, and in the contest -44

There was a time

QUESTION:

But I thought, and maybe I'm

2

mistaken, but I thought it directed that certain votes

3

that had been tabulated after the expiration of the

4

original certification date were to be included now

5

without reference to the point at all that their opinion

6

had been vacated.

7

I just didn't know how that worked.

MR. BOIES:

Well, there are three different

8

groups of votes, okay?

And with respect

-- Broward, Palm

9

Beach, and Miami-Dade.

With respect to Miami-Dade and

10

Palm Beach, there was a trial.

11

It is the appeal from that trial that is before this

Court.

QUESTION:

This was a trial, Mr.

Boies, in the

circuit court of Miami-Dade?
MR. BOIES:

Yes.

No.

In the Circuit Court of

23

Leon County.

Because it's a statewide election, the

24

contest procedure takes you to Leon County, regardless of

25

where the votes are cast.

But what the, what the, what

the court found there, and there was undisputed evidence,

It said that those votes had to be

certified, which certainly contravenes our vacating of

add more numbers, but as I read the Florida Supreme Court

10

opinion, it said the Secretary of State will certify these

11

MR. BOIES:

Yes.

Because the contest procedure

is a procedure to contest the certification.

what the Florida Supreme Court was saying after this trial

is yes, you proved that this certification is missing 250

That's what every contest proceeding is.

Yes.
With respect to Broward, what you

have is you have these votes that have been counted, and

MR. BOIES:

whether it is in the criminal law, an administrative

11

practice, whether it is in local government, whenever

12

somebody is coming to government

13

QUESTION:

--.

But here you have something

14

objective.

15

are looking at a piece of paper, and the supreme courts in

16

the states of South Dakota and the other cases have told

17

us that you will count this hanging by two corners or one

18

corner, this is susceptible of a uniform standard, and yet

19

you say it can vary from table to table within the same

20

county.

21

You are not just reading a person's mind.

MR. BOIES:

You

With respect, it is susceptible of a

22

more specific standard, and some states, like Texas, have

23

given a statutory definition, although even in Texas,

24

there is a catch-all that says anything else that clearly

25

specifies the intent of the voter.
50

So even, even where

1

states have approached this in an attempt to give

2

specificity, they have ended up with a catch-all provision

3

that says look at the intent of the voter.

4

QUESTION:

But they have ended up with a

5

catch-all provision because I assume there may be cases in

6

which the general rule would otherwise operate in which

7

there is an affirmative counter indication to what the

8

general rule would provide, but I think what's bothering

9

Justice Kennedy and it's bothering a lost us here is we

10

seem to have a situation here in which there is a

11

subcategory of ballots in which we are assuming for the

12

sake of argument since we know no better that there is no

13

genuinely subjective indication beyond what can be viewed

14

as either a dimple or a hanging chad, and there is a

15

general rule being applied in a given county that an

16

objective intent or an intent on an objective standard

17

will be inferred, and that objective rule varies, we are

18

told, from county to county.

19

objective rule for all counties and if there isn't, why

20

isn't it an equal protection violation?

21

MR. BOIES:

Why shouldn't there be one

Let me answer both questions.

22

First, I don't think there is a series of objective

23

interpretations, objective criteria that would vary county

24

by county.

25

QUESTION:

All right.
51

But on the assumption

1

that there may be, if we were fashioning a response to the

2

equal protection claim, and we assume as a fact that there

3

may be variations, wouldn't those variations as, from

4

county to county, on objective standards, be an equal

5

protection violation?

6

MR. BOIES:

I don't think so.

I don't think so,

7

Your Honor, because I think there are a lot of times in

8

the law in which there can be those variations from jury

9

to jury, from public official to public official.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but in jury to jury cases, we

11

assume that there is not an overall objective standard

12

that answers all questions definitively.

13

that there is detail that cannot be captured by an

14

objective rule.

15

We are assuming

The assumption of this question, and I think, I

Is it really, does not the procedure that is in

achieved by having the final results all reviewed by the

11

14

of decisions that people get a right to object to is all

19

problems that pertain not just to the equal protection

aspect of this, but to the rationality of the supreme

be de novo review by the circuit judge in Leon County.

counts that had come out of Palm Beach and Broward

MR. BOIES:

10

hundreds of ballots that they could discern the clear

11

intent of the voter from that were not machine read.

Now, in doing so, they were applying Florida

13

law, and like the law of many states, it has a general

14

standard, not a specific standard.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Were those dimpled or hanging chads,

so to speak?
MR. BOIES:

Well, what he testified is that you

18

looked at the entire ballot, that if you found something

19

that was punched through all the way in many races, but

20

just indented in one race, you didn't count that

21

indentation, because you saw that the voter could punch it

22

through when the voter wanted to.

23

you found a ballot that was indented all the way through,

24

you counted that as the intent of the voter.

Another, another thing that they

counted was he said they discerned what voters sometimes

did was instead of properly putting the ballot in where it

was supposed to be, they laid it on top, and then what you

10

would do is you would find the punches went not through

11

the so-called chad, but through the number.

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't the standard the one

MR. BOIES:

I mean, why don't we go

Well, Your Honor, because in Florida

law, since 1917, Darby against State, the Florida Supreme

18

Court has held that where a voter's intent can be

discerned, even if they don't do what they're told, that's

supposed to be counted, and the thing I wanted to say

The Supreme Court in 1998, well before this

election, said you've got to count those votes.

fact, they counted those votes even though the way the

4

canvassing board dealt with them was to go back and mark

5

them over with a big black marker, which made it

6

impossible to check whether the canvassing board had

7

really just marked over the ballot or had put a new mark

8

on the ballot.

QUESTION:

Mr.

And in

Boies, can I come back to this

10

discrepancy between Palm Beach and Broward County?

I'm

11

reading from footnote 16 of the Florida Supreme Court's

12

opinion.

13

requested on behalf of Vice President Gore in four

14

counties

15

Broward County and Volusia County timely completed a

16

manual recount.

17

manual recounts in Volusia County and Broward County were

18

included in the statewide certifications.

On November 9, 2000, a manual recount was

-- miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Volusia.

It is undisputed that the results of the

19

MR. BOIES:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And those statewide certifications

21

the Supreme Court ordered to be accepted.

22

Supreme Court, while applying a standard of supposedly de

23

novo review of the certifications, is requiring the

24

Circuit Court to accept both Broward County, which does

25

one thing with dimpled ballots, and Palm Beach County,
59

So it is -- the

1

which does something clearly different.

2

MR. BOIES:

Your Honor, the de novo review is in

3

the contest phase, and neither Volusia County nor Broward

4

County was a contest filed.

5

is that you've got de novo review in a contest.

A contest

6

relates to specific ballots that are contested.

The

7

ballots in Broward and Volusia were not contested by any

8

party.

QUESTION:

What the Supreme Court holds

But the determination that the

10

circuit court has to make about whether it's necessary to

11

have a recount is based upon the certifications.

MR. BOIES:

QUESTION:

4

And you had a certification.
And here you are telling him to

accept it not de novo, but deferring to Broward County.
MR. BOIES:

I think what the Supreme Court is

5

saying is you have got a certification.

6

certification shows a certain vote total.

7

that certification until it is contested, and it can be

8

contested by either or both parties.

9

until it is contested, you do not have contested ballots.

10

Once have you contested ballots, then going back to State

11

against Williams, Nuccio against Williams in 1929, cited

12

in our papers, then it becomes a judicial question, and

13

what the court holds is you then look at that as a

14

judicial matter and that is why you have going on in Leon

15

County the review of the Miami-Dade ballots under the

16

court's supervision.

23

want to review the undervotes all around the state.

QUESTION:

We also asked to have the

They also said, which

justices in the Supreme Court of Florida said that meant

177,000 ballots.

2

Was he correct in your view?

MR. BOIES:

No.

That is a result of adding the

3

so-called undervotes that were mentioned and the so-called

4

overvotes that were mentioned.

5

no vote registers for president or an overvote where two

6

or more registers for president are discarded, because you

7

can't vote twice, and if you vote not at all, and in

8

either circumstance, your vote doesn't get counted.

QUESTION:

Either an undervote where

So if you disagree that 177,000

10

ballots will be involved in this recount, how many do you

11

think there are?

12

MR. BOIES:

It's approximately 60,000, I think,

13

Your Honor.

14

the recounts that have already been completed, but I think

15

the total sort of blank ballots for the presidency start

16

at around 60,000.

17
18

It turns out to be less than that because of

QUESTION:
question.

Mr.

Boies, can I ask, ask you this

Does that mean there are 110,000 overvotes?

19

MR. BOIES:

20

QUESTION:

That's right.
And if that's the case, what is your

21

response to the Chief Justice of Florida's concern that

22

the recount relates only to undervotes and not overvotes?

23

MR. BOIES:

Well first, nobody asked for a

24

contest of the overvotes, and the contest statute begins

25

with a party saying that there is either a rejection of
62

1
2

legal votes or an acceptance of illegal votes.
QUESTION:

But as a matter of remedy it's

3

ordered a statewide recount in counties where the ballots

4

were not contested, and that's where I'm having some

5

difficulty, and it goes back to, in part to your answer

6

that you gave to Justice Stevens

7

Broward County, and in part to the answer you are giving

8

to Justice Stevens now.

9

hand to Justice Scalia, oh, well, these weren't part of

-- Justice Scalia about

Why is it that you say on the one

10

the contest, but now all of a sudden we are talking about

11

statewide, not all of which were contested, but we are not

12

talking about the overvotes?

13

MR. BOIES:

Two parts to the answer.

The reason

14

that I said what I did to Justice Scalia was that I think

15

that if this Court were to rule that there was something

16

wrong with the statewide recounts, that they were being

17

done by canvassing boards as opposed to directly by the

18

court, or because the court was not supervising the

19

particular expression of voter intent, what the court

20

would have done is simply cut back on a remedy that we

21

didn't ask for.

22

The second part is that when you are dealing

23

with overvotes, remember, this is a machine issue.

When

24

you are dealing with overvotes, the machine has already

25

registered two votes.

Now, there may be another vote
63

1

there, a dimpled vote or an indented vote that the machine

2

did not register.

3

doesn't get counted for the presidency.

4

But once you get two votes, that ballot

QUESTION:

They gave an example.

The example

5

they gave in their brief was there is a punch for Governor

6

Bush, and then there is a punch for write-in and the

7

write-in says I want Governor Bush and so I think their

8

implication is that that would have been rejected by the

9

machine, but if you looked at it by hand the intent of the

10

voter would be clear.

11

votes, but they say there might be.

12

Now I don't know if there are such

There is nothing in the record that

suggests that there are such votes.

14

contested the overvotes, it would have been a relatively

15

simple process to test that because you could simply test

16

it as to whether the double vote was a write-in vote or

17

was another candidate.

18

QUESTION:

If anybody had

I gathered from the opinion of the

19

Supreme Court of Florida that the Vice President did not

20

ask for as broad a recount as the Supreme Court granted,

21

but that it thought that to do just what he wanted would

22

be unfair and therefore out of fairness, they granted the

23

wider recount, am I correct in that?

24
25

MR. BOIES:

I think that's right.

that's the way I would interpret it, Mr.
64

I think

Chief Justice.

1

QUESTION:

Mr.

Boies, I have one other

2

perplexity about the scheme that's been set up here.

3

-- there is a very, as you point out, there is scant

statutory provision concerning, concerning the contest.

There is quite detailed statutory provision concerning the

6

protest period.

time limits and all of that.

place, including this one, that has been the baseline that

phase have been identified as disputed ballots, so that

24

contest deals with.

25

QUESTION:

What is left over are those ballots that one

My concern is that the contest period
65

1

as we have been talking about requires the setting of

2

standards, judicial review, and by reason of what I take

3

it to be your earlier position in the litigation, this

4

period has been truncated by 19 days, causing the time

5

frame of which we are all so conscious, making it

6

difficult for appellate review, and it seems to me, and we

7

are getting back to the beginning of this, that the

8

legislature could not have done that by a statute without

9

it being under law, and that neither can the Supreme Court

10

without it being a new law, a new scheme, a new system for

11

recounting at this late date.

12

MR. BOIES:

I'm very troubled by that.

But, Your Honor, at this -- leaving

13

aside the prior case about the extension of the time for

14

certification, which I think at this stage you have to

15

leave aside because at the contest stage, what you are

16

doing is you are contesting specific ballots whether or

17

not they were included in the certification.

18

It's absolutely clear under Florida law that

19

that's what the contest is about, so at the contest stage,

20

the only question is can you complete the contest of the

21

contested ballots in the time available?

22

Everything that's in the record is, that we

23

could have and indeed we still may be able to, if that

24

count can go forward.

13

would be completed in about another day.

procedures ready to count.

the Supreme Court of Florida want briefs and wouldn't the

parties have needed time to prepare briefs?

MR. BOIES:

Yes, Your Honor, but as we did in

this Court, we have done in the Florida Supreme Court a

22

number of times and that is to do the briefs and have the

argument the next day and a decision within 24 hours.

I think the Florida court has sort of

ignored that old Boardman case.

13

MR. BOIES:

Your Honor, I think the Boardman

14

case relates not to the counting of votes, it has nothing

15

to do with the standard in terms of the intent of the

16

voter.

17

referring to is at page 268 of the Southern Reporter

18

report of that case, and what is clear from that page and

19

that discussion is it's dealing with the issue of whether

20

or not because the canvassing board threw away the

21

envelopes from the absentee ballots so they could not be

22

checked, whether that invalidated the absentee ballots,

23

and the court says no, it doesn't, because it's important

24

to count all these votes, and because we assume that what

25

they were doing was proper.

The Boardman case, the language that you're

That does not, I respectfully
70

1

suggest, at all deal with the question of deference to the

2

voter intent determination which the court has repeatedly

3

said is a matter for judicial determination.

The other thing that I would say with respect to

5

intent is I know the Court is concerned about whether the

standard is too general or not.

Some states have made

There's a sense where that may be an

Article II issue.

14

QUESTION:

Mr.

Boies, let's assume that at end

15

of the day the Leon County, Florida judge, gets a series

16

of counts from different counties, and they heard those

17

counties have used different standards in making their

18

counts.

19

violation of the Constitution for the Leon County judge to

20

say, I don't care that there are different standards as

21

long as they purported to fall on intent of the voter,

22

that's good enough.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Mr.

At that point, in your judgment, is it a

I'll extend your time by two minutes,

Boies.
MR. BOIES:

Yes.

I do not believe that that
71

1

would violate the equal protection of due process clause.

2

That distinction between how they interpret the intent of

3

the voter standard is going to have a lot less effect on

4

how votes are treated than the mere difference in the

5

types of machines that are used.

6

QUESTION:

Then the fact that there is a single

7

judge at the end of the process, in your judgment, really

8

is not an answer to the concern that we have raised.

9

MR. BOIES:

No, I think it is an answer.

I

10

think there are two answers to it.

11

the answer that they did it differently, different people

12

interpreting the general standard differently, would not

13

raise a problem even in the absence of judicial review of

14

that.

15

First, I think that

Second, even if that would have raised a

16

constitutional problem, I think the judicial review that

17

provides the standardization would solve that problem.

18

The third thing that I was saying is that any

19

differences as to how this standard is interpreted have a

20

lot less significance in terms of what votes are counted

21

or not counted than simply the differences in machines

22

that exist throughout the counties of Florida.

23

There are five times as many undervotes in punch

24

card ballot counties than in optical ballot counties.

25

Now, for whatever that reason is, whether it's voter error
72

or machine problems, that statistic, you know, makes clear

2

that there is some difference in how votes are being

treated county by county.

4

than the difference in how many votes are recovered in

5

Palm Beach or Broward or Volusia or Miami-Dade, so that

6

the differences of interpretation of the standard, the

general standard are resulting in far fewer differences

among counties than simply the differences in the machines

that they have.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.

16

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice.

I

17

would like to start with a point or two with respect to

18

the equal protection due process component of this case.

19

The Florida Democratic Party on November 20 was asking

20

the

21

Supreme Court to establish uniform standards with respect

22

to the looking at and evaluating these ballots, a

23

recognition that there were no uniform standards and that

24

there ought to be.

25

-- november 20th of this year, was asking the Florida

Last Tuesday in the 11th Circuit, unless I
73

1

misheard him, the attorney for the Attorney General of

2

Florida said that the standards for evaluating these

3

ballots are evolving.

4

this record, that there are different standards from

5

county to county.

6

QUESTION:

There is no question, based upon

And there are different ballots from

7

county to county too, Mr.

Olson, and that's part of the

8

argument that I don't understand.

9

there's the optical scanning, and then there are a whole

There are machines,

10

variety of ballots.

11

we've heard about and other kinds of postcard ballots.

12

How can you have one standard when there are so many

13

varieties of ballots?

14

MR. OLSON:

There is the butterfly ballot that

Certainly the standard should be

15

that similarly situated voters and similarly situated

16

ballots ought to be evaluated by comparable standards.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Then you would have to have several

standards, county by county would it be?
MR. OLSON:

You're certainly going to have to

20

look at a ballot that you mark in one way different than

21

these punch card ballots.

22

the punch card ballots, is that there are different

23

standards for evaluating those ballots from county to

24

county and it is a documented history in this case that

25

there have been different standards between November 7th

Our point is, with respect to

74

1

and the present with respect to how those punch card

2

ballots are evaluated.

3

Palm Springs is the best example.

They started

4

with a clear rule which had been articulated and explained

5

to the voters, by the way, as of 1990.

6

the process of evaluating these ballots and changed the

7

standard from moment to moment during the first day and

8

again, they evolved from the standard that the chad had to

9

be punched through to the so-called dimpled ballot

Then they got into

10

standard, indentations on the ballot.

11

why that was done.

12

enough additional votes so that there's pressure on to

13

change the standards.

14

which is where the process is ultimately subjective,

15

completely up to the discretion of the official, and

16

there's no requirement of any uniformity.

17

There was a reason

It was because they weren't producing

And that will happen in a situation

Now, we now have something that's worse than

18

that.

We have standards that are different throughout 64

19

different counties.

20

considered where an indentation on a ballot will now be

21

counted as a vote, but other ballots that may have

22

indentations aren't going to be counted at all.

23

overvotes are in a different category, and in this very

24

remedy the ballots in Miami-Dade are being treated

25

differently.

We've got only undercounts being

The

Some of them have been all examined and the
75

1

balance of the process, the remaining 80 percent will be

2

looked at only in connection with the undercounts.

3

QUESTION:

Mr.

Olson, do I understand that your

4

argument on the equal protection branch would render

5

academic what was your main argument that's troublesome,

6

that is that we must say that the Florida Supreme Court

7

was so misguided in its application of its own law that we

8

reject that, and we, the Supreme Court of the United

9

States, decide what the Florida law is?

10

MR. OLSON:

I'm not sure I know the answer to

11

that question, whether that would render academic the

12

challenge.

13

our opinion, with respect to Article II because virtually

14

every aspect of Florida's election code has been changed

15

as a result of these two decisions.

16

There is a clear constitutional violation, in

QUESTION:

But the Florida Supreme Court told us

17

that it hasn't been changed and just looking at one of the

18

cases that you cite frequently, the O'Brien against

19

Skinner case, this court said, well, maybe we would have

20

decided the New York law differently but the highest court

21

of the state has concluded otherwise.

22

function to construe a state statute contrary to the

23

construction given it by the highest court of the state.

24
25

MR. OLSON:

It is not our

The only thing I can say in response

to that is that what this Court said one week ago today,
76

1

that as a general rule the court defers to a state court's

2

interpretation of a state statute, but not where the

3

legislature is acting under authority granted to it by the

4

Constitution of the United States.

5

The final point I would like to make is with

6

respect to section 5.

It is quite clear that the court in

7

both the earlier decision and the decision last Friday was

8

aware and concerned about compliance with section 5.

9

construed section 5 in a way that allowed it by labeling

It

10

what it was doing as interpretation to change in dramatic

11

respects the Florida election law, and we submit because

12

it did, so misconstrued the applicability not only with

13

respect to finality but the other part of section 5

14

requires a determination of controversies pursuant to a

15

set of laws that are in place at the time of the

16

elections.

17

QUESTION:

If you start with the premise, a

18

clear intent of a vote should count, where there's a clear

19

intent on the ballot, it should count as a vote, can't you

20

reasonably get the majority's conclusion?

21

MR. OLSON:

I don't believe so because we know

22

different standards were being applied to get to that

23

point, and they were having different results.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
The case is submitted.
77

Thank you, Mr.

Olson.
