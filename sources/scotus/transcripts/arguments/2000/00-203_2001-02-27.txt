ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

12

back pay for purposes of the Federal Insurance

13

Contribution Act, known as FICA,

14

Unemployment Tax Act, known as FUTA, whether back pay

15

under those statutes is taxed in the amounts applicable to

16

the year in which it was paid, or the year in which it

17

should have been paid.

18

and the Federal

In our view, the plain language of the statute

19

provides a clear answer to that question.

All five of the

20

statutory provisions that are directly applicable to this

21

case base the tax on, quote, the wages paid during the

22

calendar year, not the wages that should have been paid,

23

or would have been paid, or could have been paid if events

24

had been other than they were.

with your case, and that is the case from this Court

2

dealing not with the taxability, but with the calculation

3

of benefits under statutes using the very same language,

4

where we look back at the year when it should have been

5

paid in calculating benefits, and your opponent is going

6

to say, and has said in the brief, that it will cause lots

7

of disruption if we were to adopt your view in that area.

8

Can you have these statutes using the very same language

9

and have a different interpretation for calculating

10

benefits than you do for taxing --

11

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

Let me just --

-- the wages?
I have one caveat before I answer

the question, which is, actually the language in nobody's

15

view, I think, is the same.

QUESTION:

Well, but they both have language

referring to wages paid.
MR. FELDMAN:

Right, that's true, but they --

22

it's slightly different.

They say calendar quarters in

23

which it was paid, so it is slightly different, even the

24

provision that might have been applicable there, but

25

beyond that, the Court in Nierotko based its decision on

the purposes of the Social Security Act in providing

security for people as they reach older age and as they

3

retire.

4

the particular statutes it had there in terms of the

5

statutory scheme in which it was found, which was a

6

security scheme of that sort.

7

QUESTION:

The Court referred to that, and I think construed

Okay,

but in answer to my question,

8

are you taking the view that we can leave that the way it

is and calculate benefits --

Yes.

-- the way Nierotko suggests and not

be disturbed by the fact that it's a different view here?
MR. FELDMAN:

I actually think that there's no

14

problem at all.

In the first place I'd point out that

15

that's the way it's been -- the Internal Revenue Service

16

since the time of Nierotko has taken the position that the

17

wages-paid rule is a statutory test for taxes.

18

other hand, the Social Security Administration has taken

19

the view that at least for statutory back pay, which

20

wouldn't apply to this case, but at least for statutory

21

back pay they will allocate it back, and that's been going

22

on for 60 years, and it hasn't caused an enormous problem.

23

In fact, it's caused no problem at all.

On the

24

As far as the specific -- I mean, I could go

25

through some of the specific examples of problems that

respondents say would be caused in the statute by their

2

view.

3

for money that's paid to somebody more than six -- on

4

disability, for disability more than 6 months after the

5

person -- the employee stopped working for the employer.

6

For example, there is a -- an exclusion from wages

Well, I don't see any problem that is created by

7

applying the wages paid for taxes to that payment.

In

8

fact, the problem would be created quite the contrary.

9

Under the wages-paid rule, you look, you count 6 months

10

after the employee stopped working, which is what Congress

11

wanted to do.

12

taxed.

13

Payments made after that date are not

Payments made before that date are taxed.
Under respondent's view, you'd have to take all

14

the payments that were made after that date and try to

15

figure out whether they should have been paid, should they

16

have been paid earlier or should they have been paid

17

later.

18

QUESTION:

Don't those records have to be kept

19

for social security allocation purposes, so the

20

employer -- to determine quarters of coverage, would have

21

to supply those records to the Social Security

22

Administration.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, not quite.

The Social

Security -- the issue arises, I would say, with less

25

intensity and frequency in Social Security for a number of

reasons.

2

Social Security scheme, they essentially permit you

3

either -- your choice, option of either going back or

4

using the wages-paid rule, and therefore a lot of cases,

5

since you have a choice a lot of cases don't even arise,

6

because they just use the wages-paid rule.

7

One is that as a Social Security -- under the

Secondly, under the Social Security scheme,

8

because of the way that works, it's a lot less

9

significant, the allocation decision.

Under Social

10

Security, all you need is 40 quarters of coverage in order

11

to be a fully-insured individual, and most people already

12

have that, and it doesn't really matter whether it's in

13

the quarter that it would be paid or the quarter, or some

14

other quarter it's allocated to.

15

In addition, under the Social Security scheme,

16

your benefits are based essentially on your average annual

17

earnings.

18

It's just an average annual earnings.

19

matter where you allocate the wages, it won't make much

20

difference for most people's Social Security, because

21

you're taking an average anyhow over some many-year period

22

of time, usually.

23

That's the way they're currently calculated.
It doesn't really

Now, I'm not saying it will never make a

24

difference, but the issue arises much less sharply and

with much less frequency in the Social Security context,

1

but in any event --

2

QUESTION:

But my question really is, are you

3

taking a position that the provisions, the FICA and FUTA,

4

however you pronounce it, that those provisions dictate

5

the position that the Government is taking, or are you

6

saying, yeah, they could have gone for symmetry with

7

Nierotko, but this statute could go either way, and our

8

consistent interpretation, the service's consistent

9

interpretation has been when it's paid is when it's

10

income?

11

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I think the wages-paid

12

language in FICA and FUTI -- FUTA is entirely unambiguous.

13

It says, wages paid during the particular year, and I

14

think that that ends the question as far as FICA and FUTA

15

goes.

16

The Court in Nierotko adopted a different

17

construction of somewhat different language in the Social

18

Security Act.

19

probably that the Court felt that this was not -- didn't

20

tie it to any particular -- the allocation question --

21

didbn't tie to any particular language, but just decided

22

that an exception of this sort was necessary to accomplish

23

the purposes of the Social Security Act.

1

MR. FELDMAN:

No, we don't.

It was a statutory

2

decision, and I don't think that there's any basis to

3

overrule it.

4

I think that they -- the Court didn't give any

5

explanation of how it arrived at the conclusion that you

6

have to allocate back based on any particular language of

7

the statute, and that's one reason why I think the best

8

reading of Nierotko is that the Court was just adopting a

9

kind of extrastatutory exception, and saying, given the

10

purposes of the Social Security Act and providing security

11

for people so that they'll know they'll get the funds and

12

won't descend into poverty as they get older, given those

13

purposes, this is really the only way to do it for those

14

purposes.

15

The Court did not look at the specific language

16

of the statutes here, or the specific changes that those

17

statutes had gone through to arrive at that language.

18

Originally in 1935, in the 1935 Act, the FICA, what became

19

FICA and FUTA -- it was actually all part of the Social

20

Security Act -- those taxes were based on wages paid for

21

employment during a year.

22

agreed at that time, you had to look at when the

23

employment occurred, not when the wages were paid.

24
25

That meant, and everybody

That scheme was in effect for a few years and
the 1939 Congress saw that it caused confusion and

difficulties and said, we have to change this, because we

2

don't want to have to -- it's easy to figure out when

3

somebody was paid.

4

that they were paid in March of 1994 and usually that's a

5

question that doesn't cause any problem, so we're going to

6

base the taxes in 1939 on the wages paid.

7

Indeed, in this case they stipulated

Now, in 1946, Congress extended that to the

8

wage-base provision, so by 1946 everything was in line to

9

avoid the kind of confusions and uncertainty that were

10

caused by having to look and see when the employment was

11

performed.

12

QUESTION:

But none of the statutory changes

13

address this point specifically.

MR. FELDMAN:

I think, quite to the contrary, I

think they do.

changes to wages paid was an unambiguous change that

17

required that the tax be based on whether --

QUESTION:

It is certainly unambiguous with

respect to the normal payment of wages in accordance with

20

whatever the wage contract is, but if we take the

21

position, and I will confess that I -- I'm inclined to,

22

and that's what I want you to address.

If we take the position that the statute simply

24

does not address the problem that we've got here -- it

25

addressed the problem of accrual versus cash methods when

1

you're doing your taxing in the normal course, but it

2

doesn't address the, in effect the back-wage problem, if

3

we take that position, why isn't it sensible for us to say

4

the normal, bedrock philosophy of remedial orders is to

5

put the wronged party in the position that the wronged

6

party would have been in if, in fact, the defendant has

7

acted as the defendant should have, and if we take that

8

position, then we're going to, in effect, find the wages

9

payable for these various tax purposes when they should

10
11

have been paid.
MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think that that's the --

12

that is the philosophy when you have litigation between

13

the wrongdoer and the wronged party.

14

that's a part of the philosophy of the tax code.

any wrong in this case or in any of the other cases --

effect, have a -- in effect a different rule for its

taxation from the rule which in effect determines the

should we have disparate rules?

MR. FELDMAN:

But what is -- I -- we don't have the

same problem of administration when we look back with back

problem in 1939, which was an accrual kind of problem in

the administrative problem is in the back pay context.

MR. FELDMAN:

In other words, don't -- at the

I don't think that that's

Back pay was attributable to '86,

on what basis the employer is working, but since the

When Congress enacted

Mr. Feldman, can I just ask, you may

3

have covered this, but in the red brief, toward the end of

4

the brief, there were a lot of anomalous examples.

5

6

purposes, you get a bunch of anomalies they suggest, and

7

your response to all of that is, as I understand it,

8

that's been true for 40 or 50 years, and it really isn't

9

all that serious.

10

If you

Is that your answer?

MR. FELDMAN:

I think, two answers.

One is it

11

has been true for 40 or 50 years, and it hasn't caused any

12

major problems, but second is, I just don't think that

13

there are anomalies, the anomalies would be created.

14

Let me take another example.

There's the

15

example of a case where payments that are made to the

16

estate of someone who's deceased in the year after they

17

died, are not taxed under FICA and FUTA, but if the

18

payment is made during the year -- in the same year that

19

they died, they are taxed under FICA and FUTA.

20

provides a bright line.

21

you look, you see when the payment was made, and you

22

decide whether you have to pay the FICA and FUTA taxes,

23

which is very consistent with how Congress wanted this

24

scheme to work.

25

It's easy to administer.

all the payments that were made after the year that the

2

person died and try to see, well, was there some reason

3

why they really should have been made earlier, were they

4

late, were they delayed, did the employer not make the

5

payment on time, was there a dispute, whatever, and you

6

have to sort all that out.

7

I think under the logic of respondent's

8

position, which is, you're trying to put people, the

9

Federal Government in the FICA and FUTA system is trying

10

to put people in the same position they would have been if

11

the taxes had been paid when they should have been, you

12

have exactly the reverse problem, too.

13

All the payments that were made during the year

14

that the person died, you have to look, well, were those

15

advance payments, should they really have been made in the

16

next year, why shouldn't they be made in the next year,

17

then they're not taxable, and I don't really see any way

18

to distinguish between any of those cases.

19

I think Congress enacted a precisely drawn

20

statute here with carefully drawn provisions that drew

21

sharp lines and were easy to administer, and the

22

wages-paid rule is the classic example of that, because

23

it's -- there's very few disputes about when wages are

24

actually paid, and if it's applied in accordance with its

terms, then the result is that you were able to do it, and

The -- I would add that the provisions at issue

6

in Nierotko at most -- the Court in Nierotko did not

7

discuss or cite any of the tax provisions at issue here.

8

At the very most, they referred to section 209(g) of the

9

1939 Act, which had slightly different language from the

10

tax provisions that are in issue here, although I wouldn't

11

make a big deal out of that.

12

It talked about quarters in which wages were

13

paid, rather than wages paid during a year, but it had

14

slightly different language, and I think the Court's whole

15

approach in Nierotko was driven by its impression of the

16

purposes, the need for security in an old age security

17

system, which is what the Social Security system was.

18

It would be anomalous to take that approach,

19

that was driven by the purposes of that system and was,

20

insofar as the Court was looking at language at all was

driven by language of different provisions that are in a

context that's talking about benefits determinations and

the language of Chevron, but given the history of the

delegation by the Secretary of Treasury to the head of the

13

IRS, I don't see why they wouldn't get the same deference.

14

The IRS, when they publish revenue rulings, says

these don't have the full breadth of scope, because they

generally deal with just a narrow issue, and they don't

positions taken here today.
With respect to Nierotko, I think I understand

3

the United States to have finally conceded that the

4

pivotal language in the Nierotko decision is the

5

wages-paid language, and that there is no meaningful

6

distinction between the wages-paid language that was the

7

basis for the interpretation in that case and the

8

wages-paid language that we have inherited now that is the

9

subject of the provisions that are at issue in this

10
11

particular case.
But to the extent that there is any question on

12

that, I would ask the Court to recognize first of all it's

13

clear that the Court was interpreting the 1939 amendments,

14

which contains that language.

concept that did not exist prior to 1939, so it clearly

essentially that argument said, we have no doubt that it,

referring to back pay, should be allocated to the periods

when the regular wages were not paid as usual.

4

I think there's no other way to interpret

One is, in the 1946 amendments, Congress was very clear

2

when it said, what we want here is conformity on the

benefits side and on the tax side, and therefore the

ultimate question about administrative convenience isn't

the answer.

6

What Congress wanted was for the two schemes to

be the same, so to the extent that the benefits tends to

take you back in time, as I think the Government has

conceded today it continues to do, in order to comply or

to further the overall objective of Congress in 1946, you

have to do the same thing on the tax side, otherwise

conformity is completely impossible to achieve, and that's

the overriding congressional purpose, it seems to me.

But you know, if there's some mechanism in there

I don't think you can analyze the same language in the

interpret them as allowing fundamentally different

administrative ease.

Let's be clear about this, there is an entire

set of accounting rules for Social Security that exist

today, and a complete set of accounting rules that apply

under the IRS, and as I understand the Government's

position, Social Security is absolutely right in its

interpretation of what's required here, so if you're going

It's exactly identical in both the

Social Security benefits language and the Social

Wages paid is the operative language and, as I understand

the Government today, they concede that's the key term

that we're focusing on, and that language was used, you

know, with the express statement in the legislative

about what the Internal Revenue Service's motive was here,

other than -- I do think it's important to put in context,

remember, the Internal Revenue -- the Government's

position here is, this doesn't promote fairness, this

doesn't promote revenue enhancement.

The sole purpose that they try to promote is

some notion of administrative simplicity, and so they have

15

QUESTION:

If you want to talk about violence to

of violence to the statute, and I suppose the question is

whether you're going to -- whether it's worse to extend

that violence to both half of -- both halves of the

be a colorable argument but for the fact that Congress,

2

before the ink was dried on Nierotko, looked at exactly

3

that language, adopted exactly that language, and

4

engrafted it into the statute on a going-forward basis,

5

and so the notion that the Court might revisit Nierotko,

6

you know, today -- I mean, 1) the Government doesn't ask

7

you to, and 2) it doesn't make sense to do that, and

8

second, I don't even understand the Government to be

9

asking you to reconsider it on the benefits side.

10

What it says is, you can have a tax rule that

11

goes in one direction, a benefits rule that goes in

12

another direction, when the language is exactly identical.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I would hope that the Court

would rigorously enforce the ruling in Nierotko and -- but

beyond that, I think you get more mileage in this

particular context, because Congress in 1946 ratified

Nierotko and implemented it on a going-forward basis, so,

point.

2

The second point is, what they did do there is,

3

they also did not change the specific provision that was

4

at issue in Nierotko, which was a benefits provision.

5

was a definition of who is a fully qualified individual.

6

They didn't change that at all, and so they didn't discuss

7

it.

8
9

It

What they did change was the tax provision for
the wage base, and that provision they changed to move it

10

to the wages-paid rule, which they had started to bring in

11

in 1939, and they had said why they did that, to avoid the

12

confusion and difficulties that the other rule had caused.

13

Finally, then, they changed the wage base in the

14

Social Security Act, which was not at issue in Nierotko,

15

because that had nothing to do with wage bases.

16

do with who was a fully qualified -- they changed that,

17

and they said, well, we're doing this just to conform with

18

what we've done with the tax provisions.

19

It had to

I think if you put it all together, what the

20

clear intent was, was to keep the taxes easily

21

collectible, and to pursue the ease of administration that

22

they had started in 1939, and then just to bring the

23

Social Security wage base definition in line with that,

24

but I don't think saying that meant in any way, or there's

25

no reason to think that Congress thought that what -- if

they were aware at all of Nierotko, that it had anything

to do with taxes.

3

As far as the Social Security -- just two other

4

very brief points.

5

Publication 957 discusses what they -- their method is,

6

and they do give an option, because they say you can --

7

you report the back pay on your W-2, and then if you file

8

another filing allocating it back, we'll look at that.

9

you don't, you can just leave it allocated on the W-2 for

One is that the Social Security

If

the year it was paid.

11

And finally, just one other point that I thought

12

was interesting is that the 19 -- Mr. Phillips referred to

13

the 1943 income tax provision that did allow some

14

attributing back pay to prior years.

15

where it was 15 percent or more of your wages, but this

16

was a statute which they enacted, and it's called Section

17

119, Back Pay Attributable to Prior Years, and it starts

18

off, if the amount of back pay received or accrued by an

19

individual, and so on.

20

That was limited to

So when Congress wanted to address the back pay

21

problem in the income tax context, right around this time,

22

they did it, they did it in express language, they kept

23

that into effect, in effect for a certain number of years,

24

they limited it to where it's more than 15 percent of the

25

income, and then they got rid of it when they found that
