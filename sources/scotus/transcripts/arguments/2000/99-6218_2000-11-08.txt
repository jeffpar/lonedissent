CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

5

Mr. Rogers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. MARK WARD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WARD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

10

In two cases, Bouie v. City of Columbia and

11

Marks v. United States, this Court stated that ex post

12

facto principles apply to judicial decisions under very

13

narrow circumstances, and that's only when those judicial

14

decisions are unexpected and indefensible based upon the

15

law that's been expressed at the time of the conduct in

16

question.

17

This case involves a misapplication of this rule

18

of law by the Tennessee Supreme Court.

19

Tennessee Supreme Court held that its decision to overrule

20

itself and to overrule a 700-year-old rule of law was not

21

unexpected and indefensible based upon this test that this

22

Court adopted.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

In this case, the

Has the Supreme Court of Tennessee

ever applied the year-and-a-day rule to a case?
MR. WARD:

The court has recognized it since
3

1

1907, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

I -- that wasn't my question, because

3

I think your opponent says it was dicta.

4

was not dicta, that it actually let somebody off on that

5

basis?

6
7

MR. WARD:

Do you say it

It was not dicta in that case.

In

1907 in Percer v. State, if I could explain --

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. WARD:

-- the court reversed in Percer v.

10

State for numerous reasons.

11

defendant without the defendant being present.

12

Among those, they tried the

One of the reasons they reversed was because

13

they put on proof during the trial as to the date of the

14

death of the deceased, the witness said that it happened

15

sometime in July, but never testified as to what date,

16

what day of the month in July, or what year in July.

17

court in -- the Tennessee Supreme Court referenced the

18

year-and-a-day rule and reversed the case, because absent

19

some evidence of what date and year there was a death,

20

then there could be insufficient evidence.

21

QUESTION:

The

Well, was it reversed because the

22

case shouldn't have been brought, or because the testimony

23

was not relevant?

24
25

MR. WARD:

The court -- the Tennessee Supreme

Court in 1907 listed numerous reasons and said for all of
4

1

these we reverse.

It's not like they said --

2

QUESTION:

Yes --

3

MR. WARD:

-- specifically, this is the one

4

we're going to reverse on.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but they didn't then analyze

6

separately the year-and-the-day rule, or -- you -- I

7

thought you'd said that a witness testified, and the

8

witness said something happened in July but she didn't say

9

when.

10

MR. WARD:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

And I'm curious whether the Supreme

12

Court of Tennessee in invoking the year-and-a-day rule

13

said it made the witness' testimony irrelevant, or did

14

it -- does the year-and-a-day rule mean that the entire

15

prosecution shouldn't have been brought?

16

MR. WARD:

Well, what the court stated was that

17

absent the -- they -- it was really a very --

18

one-paragraph opinion, a very short opinion.

They --

19

QUESTION:

The whole opinion was one --

20

MR. WARD:

No.

Most of the paragraph was -- the

21

opinion was taken up with the discussion of trying the man

22

in abstentia.

23

QUESTION:

Absentia.

24

MR. WARD:

Then there was about a half-a-page

25

paragraph that dealt with two issues.
5

One was, was this

1

indictment returned before the date of the offense or not?

2

The other one was the year-and-a-day rule, and absent this

3

testimony there was insufficient proof before the court as

4

to either fact, the year-and-a-day rule or when the

5

offense was occurred, so I contend it was not dicta in

6

that case.

7

And in this case, Your Honor, State v. Rogers,

8

the court, the Tennessee Supreme Court said, we have

9

recognized the year-and-a-day rule in Tennessee since

10
11

1907.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, there -- this case has an

12

aura of unreality about it.

13

attempted to murder the victim by stabbing him in the

14

heart with a butcher knife.

15

settled expectation that he wasn't going to be accused of

16

murder, and yet he wants to take advantage of this

17

year-and-a-day rule.

18

Your client apparently

Now, he didn't have any

I mean, what does it serve?

It's some concept of fair warning or

19

expectation, but at the time the crime was committed, I

20

guess he hoped the victim would die, and I don't see that

21

your client has been deprived of any kind of an

22

expectation.

23

MR. WARD:

Well --

24

QUESTION:

Regardless of what we do with the

25

year-and-a-day rule.
6

1
2

MR. WARD:

Well, with regard to fair warning my

client was entitled objectively.

3

Subjectively, I have to admit it is very

4

difficult to ever prove that any criminal defendant relies

5

upon the state of the law at the time that he or she

6

commits an act, but objectively he was entitled to rely

7

upon the year-and-a-day rule if the victim did survive.

8

But more importantly than that, after the fact, after he

9

was charged, fair notice and reliance applies after the

10

fact also, not just at the time of the act; otherwise, a

11

defendant who is approaching trial is never going to know

12

exactly what are the elements of the offense, or what is

13

the punishment that I'm about to face.

14

We don't just say you're entitled to fair

15

warning of the punishment at the time you commit it, but

16

you're also, based upon that time, are allowed to rely

17

upon that as you're approaching trial.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I guess we wouldn't allow a

19

court, any more than we would allow a legislature, to

20

change the law so that attempted murder now becomes

21

murder.

22

with the requirement that the victim actually die.

23

could say, gee, his expectations weren't disappointed.

24

intended to kill.

25

die.

That is, so long as you intend to kill, dispense
You

It just so happened the person didn't

He

7

1

And we certainly wouldn't uphold a State supreme

2

court judgment that, well, you know, that's a

3

technicality, we're not going to insist that the victim

4

have died, we're going to get you for murder anyway.

5

guess you could likewise say no disappointment of

6

expectations.

7

MR. WARD:

Well --

8

QUESTION:

I don't see why this is terribly

9

I

different from that.

10

MR. WARD:

Well, it's not.

Under the State's

11

theory in this case, as long as the defendant had the same

12

mens rea, same actus reis, the fact that the result

13

occurred or didn't occur would be irrelevant, and under

14

the State's theory you could eliminate the requirement

15

that there be a result and there would be no problem with

16

that.

17

But the problem is that as a matter of

18

fundamental fairness and fair warning as to punishment

19

deals with not just at the time of the act.

20

courts to retroactively alter the elements of an offense

21

or to retroactively enhance punishment, what I have to do,

22

what I have to tell my clients when we're getting ready to

23

go to trial is, I can tell you what the law was at the

24

time you committed your crime, and I can tell you what the

25

law is today, as we get ready to go for trial, and you're
8

If we allow

1

innocent of the law as we have it today.

2

I'm going to get to tell them that.

3

because the courts can change after the fact.

4

eliminate this element of the offense.

5

QUESTION:

In some cases

But I can't tell you,
They can

Mr. Ward, let's assume that the

6

Tennessee Supreme Court had simply affirmed the lower

7

court that said the legislature made this change, and they

8

made it long before he committed the crime.

9

have no issue at all.

10
11
12

MR. WARD:

You would

I wouldn't be here, and that would be

a matter of statutory interpretation.
QUESTION:

Now, suppose the State is one, and I

13

don't know if this is so, where you couldn't have purely

14

prospective overruling because that would be considered an

15

advisory opinion, so here's the Tennessee Supreme Court

16

saying, gee, it was our mistake in not getting rid of this

17

obsolete rule.

18

so we want to get rid of it, but we can't.

19

It's our rule, not the legislature's rule,

We're saying it's our fault, not the

20

legislature's.

We can't change, however, because if we

21

apply it to this case it's going to be ex post facto, and

22

we can't simply prospectively overrule without being an

23

advisory opinion.

24

the road, is your argument one that a court can't cure its

25

own error of this nature?

So is your -- is the -- at the end of

9

1

MR. WARD:

No, Your Honor.

The Tennessee court

2

could have abolished this rule and applied it

3

prospectively, and probably, and we contend was required

4

to do that if it wanted to abolish the rule because of the

5

ex post facto due process requirements.

6

QUESTION:

So it can give -- the Tennessee

7

courts can give an advisory opinion in that respect?

8

mean, they can --

9
10
11

MR. WARD:

I

Tennessee courts, I have no

citations, but they frequently make rulings prospectively.
QUESTION:

Well, but Justice Ginsburg's

12

hypothetical, and the point interests me as well, it's

13

actually to assume the opposite, that a court is in a

14

system where it is improper to give an advisory opinion.

15

Then what would happen?

16

MR. WARD:

The court's hands are tied.

Well, I think that the court could

17

give some indication, and could voice some discomfort with

18

the rule short of an advisory opinion.

19

QUESTION:

But it could never change it, unless

20

you're saying that the dictum would provide sufficient

21

basis for a subsequent case.

22

MR. WARD:

It would --

23

QUESTION:

Then we have an incremental

24

overruling process that you would allow?

25

changing the law.
10

They're still

1

MR. WARD:

I think the dictum in the case would

2

then be such that when a court came along later it would

3

be able to say, this was expected and defensible because

4

we criticized the rule in a previous case.

5

QUESTION:

Well --

6

QUESTION:

Well --

7

QUESTION:

-- a moment ago you were saying how

8

you had to have certainty in advising your client, but if

9

that is permissible in a gradual overruling, surely the

10

certainty is gone.

11

MR. WARD:

Well --

12

QUESTION:

You don't know what the Tennessee

13

Supreme Court is going to do the next time it comes up if

14

in the interim it has criticized the rule.

15

MR. WARD:

But I would be fairly confident, if

16

the Tennessee Supreme Court had criticized the rule in

17

advising my client that there was a substantial likelihood

18

that the rule would be changed.

19

QUESTION:

Well, suppose 10 State supreme courts

20

in other jurisdictions -- that didn't happen here -- had

21

criticized the rule and Tennessee was just quiet about it.

22

You've got the same problem.

23

MR. WARD:

Well --

24

QUESTION:

Plus -- plus we know that the day,

25

year-and-a-day rule is an outmoded relic anyway.
11

1

MR. WARD:

Well, with regard to other States I

2

think it's asking too much of our citizens to ignore a

3

rule of the Tennessee Supreme Court and look to other

4

States.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, you seem to accept it as

6

unthinkable that the Supreme Court of Tennessee should be

7

unable to alter a rule of criminal law by judicial

8

decision.

9

Federal Constitution was adopted?

10

Do you think it was unthinkable at the time the

Do you think that common law courts, which had

11

much more rigorous notions of stare decisis than we do

12

today, do you think they would have thought it unthinkable

13

that a court should not be able to suddenly make a crime

14

of what had not been a crime at common law?

15

I mean, I don't know why you accept that,

16

especially when you're dealing with a State that has a

17

constitutional provision adopted in 1870 which reads, all

18

laws and ordinances now in force and use in this State not

19

inconsistent with this constitution shall continue in

20

force and use until they shall expire, be altered, or

21

repealed by the legislature.

22

unthinkable at all, the Supreme Court of Tennessee

23

shouldn't be able to alter the criminal law.

24
25

I don't think it's

I mean, if you want to accept it, fine, but I
don't know -12

1

MR. WARD:

I'm not sure --

2

QUESTION:

-- why you would accept it.

3

MR. WARD:

-- that the Tennessee Supreme Court

4

can alter the -- I'm not sure I understand -- let -- well,

5

maybe I should continue.

6

QUESTION:

The question to you, assume that it

7

was unthinkable that the Supreme Court of Tennessee

8

shouldn't be able to change the criminal law, why it

9

should be able to do that, but that's certainly not what

10

is envisioned by the constitution of the State of

11

Tennessee.

12

QUESTION:

The question didn't assume that it

13

was unthinkable.

14

you, is this the end result?

15

Supreme Court cannot itself change its rule, only the

16

legislature can?

17

The question was simply putting it to

MR. WARD:

That is, that the Tennessee

Well, the Tennessee Supreme Court can

18

change the rule, and I have no problem with the court

19

changing the rule.

20

the retroactive --

21

QUESTION:

The problem that I'm talking about is

But they can't change it, because

22

there'll never be a case in which they can change it.

23

other words, the court in this situation, we can't change

24

it prospectively because it would be advisory.

25

change it in this case because it would be ex post facto.
13

In

We can't

1

One answer that you could give is yes, that's right, only

2

the legislature can change it, but you're not giving that

3

answer.

4

MR. WARD:

No, I'm --

5

QUESTION:

No.

6
7

How do you explain the provision

of the Tennessee constitution that I quoted?
MR. WARD:

That provision, my interpretation of

8

that provision is it refers to statutory laws and not to

9

judicial decisions of the courts, would be my

10
11

interpretation of that.
QUESTION:

May I ask you this further question?

12

Suppose we -- it's so, and we tell the Tennessee Supreme

13

Court, you're wrong, this would be an ex post facto

14

obligation.

15

Supreme Court, would it not, to say, gee, we have to

16

rethink what that lower court did, and we now decide that

17

they were right after all, that the legislature made that

18

change long before this crime was committed.

19

It would still be open to the Tennessee

It would still -- no matter what we say here, it

20

would still be open to the Tennessee Supreme Court to say

21

the change was already made by the legislature and that

22

really ended the case, and all this has been kind of an

23

academic exercise.

24
25

MR. WARD:

Well, the Tennessee Supreme Court has

already said that the legislature did not make a change in
14

1
2

it, and the year-and-a-day rule is -QUESTION:

But they could change their mind,

3

better enlightened by what's happened since then.

4

are highest courts who concede from time to time that they

5

are fallible, that they may have made a mistake.

6
7
8
9
10

MR. WARD:

There

So if this Court was to reverse, the

Tennessee Supreme Court then would change its opinion?
QUESTION:

I asked if that would be something

that would be open to the Tennessee Supreme Court to do.
MR. WARD:

I guess the Tennessee Supreme Court

11

could do it.

12

certainly try to think of some way to come back to this

13

Court, but --

14

They could certainly try it, and I would

QUESTION:

Well, can you think of one?

The

15

Tennessee Supreme Court says, gee, we got it wrong, that

16

court of criminal appeals, they had it right all along.

17

The legislature took care of it.

18

year-and-a-day rule, haven't had one for 5 years.

19

MR. WARD:

We don't have any more

I guess I have to concede that that's

20

always possible, but the Court has made a detailed

21

analysis, the Tennessee Supreme Court, they've rejected

22

that, and I believe that I would stand behind them that

23

they would not change their mind in midstream simply

24

because this Court sent the case back and said they erred

25

on another point.
15

1

But I'm not contending the Tennessee Supreme

2

Court can't change the rule.

The rule is dead in

3

Tennessee.

4

with.

5

an offense that was committed 5 years prior to that, and

6

it gets back to the basic principle of legality.

7

try defendants based upon the law that's in existence at

8

the time of their conduct, or do we change it after the

9

fact, and the problem with changing it after the fact is,

The year-and-a-day rule has been done away

The question is whether or not they can apply it to

Do we

10

what it's going to do is, it's going to undermine the

11

presumption of innocence.

12

QUESTION:

I could understand very clearly,

13

Mr. Ward, the argument if you were saying that they added

14

an element, or they subtracted an element from the

15

offense, or something like that.

16

it intentionally, but you don't have to anymore, and it's

17

a much different -- but here you have something that

18

really is quite peripheral, out on the fringes, that

19

doesn't govern the substantive criminal law at all.

20

almost like a statute of limitations.

21

MR. WARD:

You used to have to do

Well, I disagree, Your Honor.

It's

I

22

believe that this is a material element of the offense as

23

the Tennessee Supreme Court has interpreted it.

24

said that you must prove death within a year and a day in

25

order to convict of any homicide offense in Tennessee,
16

They have

1

and --

2

QUESTION:

But that would be true of a statute

3

of limitations too, would it not?

4

limitations from -- say, supposing Tennessee had a statute

5

of limitations for robbery, 10 years.

6

of Tennessee would say you have to bring an action within

7

10 years in order to convict of robbery, but that doesn't

8

really make it an element of the substantive criminal law.

9

MR. WARD:

If the statute of

The Supreme Court

No, because it doesn't deal with

10

anything with regard to the -- it doesn't deal with

11

anything but a time period that they're required to bring

12

an action in.

13

certain facts occurred in.

14

This is a time period that they must prove

QUESTION:

With a statute of limitations your

15

argument would go, you are guilty of the crime but can't

16

be prosecuted for it after the 10 years, whereas with a

17

year and a day, your position is you're not guilty of the

18

crime unless the death occurs within a year of -- within a

19

year and a day.

20

Now, your opponent says it's just evidentiary.

21

What's your response to that?

22

evidence.

23

MR. WARD:

It's just a question of

Well, it's -- as interpreted by the

24

Tennessee Supreme Court, it's not just a question of

25

evidence.

It's a material element that's required to be
17

1

proven by the prosecution, and there is nothing else -- if

2

it was a rule of admissibility of evidence, there would be

3

something else that could prove this point, or prove the

4

conviction of -- prove the elements of the crime, but this

5

is an element that, it must be proven.

6

There's nothing else available.

If you don't

7

prove this element, you don't prove your case.

8

sufficiency of the evidence rule.

9

this -- and this is -- you lose.

It's a

If you don't prove
And now we say after the

10

fact I can't prove it, we'll just eliminate it.

11

element of the offense I can't prove, we have the power to

12

retroactively eliminate.

13

QUESTION:

Any

I guess one of the questions I have

14

is whether we gain anything by characterizing it as an

15

element.

16

with, let's say, the elements that refer to the conduct of

17

the defendant, didn't it?

18

fair notice to an individual about what he could and could

19

not do at the time he acts.

20

the year-and-a-day rule is kind of like an element, it's

21

not the kind of element, it's not the kind of fact that

22

Bouie was concerned with, was -- is it?

23

If you go back to Bouie, Bouie was concerned

MR. WARD:

And Bouie was concerned about

And so even if we say, well,

It's not a fact that would deal with

24

the first Calder category, whether something was criminal,

25

made criminal after the fact, no more than whether or
18

1

not --

2

QUESTION:

No, but I -- I think I agree with you

3

there.

I mean, if we assume that Bouie stands for the

4

proposition that the ex post facto clause and all the

5

Calder analytical framework is subsumed into due process,

6

I'll be candid to say I think you win this case, and my --

7

I guess my question was really aimed at, or premised on a

8

different assumption, and that is that Bouie really does

9

not stand for wholesale incorporation, and what Bouie

10

actually held, the point as to which Bouie made a

11

difference, was a point about altering elements that

12

describe the criminal act itself as opposed to conditions

13

that may or may not occur subsequent to that.

14

MR. WARD:

I agree with Your Honor.

The cases

15

that come before this Court for the most part have dealt

16

with the first Calder category.

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

MR. WARD:

But if this Court --

19

QUESTION:

But I guess if you don't use an

20

elements test for Bouie, I guess you have to reach the

21

conclusion -- and you say it's only those things that

22

affect the conduct at the time of the offense, regardless

23

of whether it's an element or not.

24

say that you could change the law and not require for

25

murder in the first degree that the victim had died.
19

Then you would have to

1

That's a subsequent event.

You knew you shouldn't stab

2

him with a knife, intending to kill him, and the fact that

3

he died should make no difference.

I --

4

MR. WARD:

I believe --

5

QUESTION:

I can't imagine that you're allowed

6

to do that.

7

MR. WARD:

Well, that's not my argument.

8

QUESTION:

I know it isn't.

9

MR. WARD:

That's my opponent's.

10

QUESTION:

But that's what you should have said

11

in response to the Bouie argument just raised.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. WARD:

But if this Court applies one Calder

14

category there's no reason not to apply them all.

15

there's some concern about whether due process principles

16

should incorporate -- ex post facto principles should

17

apply --

18

QUESTION:

If

What is your authority, Mr. Ward, for

19

simply suggesting that all of the Calder categories are

20

carried over into this ex -- like ex post facto -- clearly

21

this is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.

22

governed by Bouie, which said some of the same

23

considerations applied.

24

is carried over bag and baggage.

25

MR. WARD:

It's

You're talking as if everything

Well, I submit it's carried over with
20

1

the Bouie limitation that the judicial decision has to be

2

unexpected and indefensible, but what I'm suggesting is,

3

there's no reason to distinguish the first Calder category

4

from any of the others as far as ranking them in some

5

priority that --

6

QUESTION:

Well, but then you're acting for --

7

asking for an extension of Bouie, which clearly didn't

8

cover these others.

9

MR. WARD:

Yes.

I'm asking -- in one sense I'm

10

asking for an extension.

11

the Court to say that it meant what it said, that ex post

12

facto principles apply through the Due Process Clause.

13

QUESTION:

In the other sense I'm asking

Well, Mr. Ward, with respect to that,

14

Calder was itself dicta, because the case came out the

15

other way, and there was something said by a justice and

16

it has become venerable over the years just because it's

17

been repeated and applied as law by later courts.

18

But then, when you're thinking of extending it

19

under a due process label, wouldn't you want to take into

20

account its origin, and the compartmentalization has been

21

criticized?

22

lock, stock and barrel.

23

as dictum and its rigidity with these categories?

24

it's not Scripture.

25

MR. WARD:

I mean, you're not bound to take it over
Why should you, given its origin
I mean,

That's correct, and actually when you
21

1

look at the definition in Bouie that was cited from Calder

2

v. Bull, the discussion talks about aggravating a crime

3

after the fact, and also making something criminal that

4

wasn't a crime after the fact, and those are the two

5

things that Bowie concentrated on in its statement or

6

definition of an ex post facto law, the first two Calder

7

categories.

8

facto for a legislature to do it, then due process should

9

prevent the courts from obtaining the same result.

10

And then the Court said, if it's ex post

My suggestion is that there's just as great a

11

harm from making something criminal that wasn't criminal

12

before as it is to aggravate a criminal offense.

13

instance, if you take something that's not a crime and

14

give it a 2-day punishment.

15

take something that already is a crime with a 2-day

16

punishment and then aggravate it to where it has a

17

20-year punishment.

18

For

It's a far greater harm to

Justice Chase talked in Calder about those

19

Calder categories and said they came from the same kinds

20

of harm, and my suggestion is that ex post facto

21

principles are fundamental concepts, fundamental concepts

22

like fundamental fairness.

23

alter the elements of an offense after the fact, or to

24

aggravate it.

25

undermines the presumption of innocence.

It's fundamentally unfair to

It's fundamentally unfair because it

22

1

QUESTION:

So everything under the Ex Post Facto

2

Clause would be subsumed under due process vis-a-vis the

3

legislature too, is it, and in fact that's what you're

4

saying, isn't it?

5

MR. WARD:

That's the rule I'm asking, but only

6

under the limited circumstance when the ruling is

7

unexpected and indefensible under the test this Court

8

adopted in Bouie and Marks.

9

Jerome Hall's principles of criminal law, and it's to take

This test was developed from

10

into consideration the fact that all opinions in one way

11

or the other are retroactive.

12

opinions that are grossly retroactive, that change a clear

13

line of authority in a jurisdiction?

14
15

How do we treat these

If there's no further questions, I'd like to
reserve the remainder of my time.

QUESTION:

Very well.

Very well, Mr. Rogers.

Mr. Moore, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

GENERAL MOORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The decision below did not deny petitioner due

23

process of law because it did not deprive him of fair

24

warning that stabbing another person in the chest with a

25

butcher knife risked prosecution under Tennessee's
23

1

homicide statutes.

2

The statute under which petitioner was convicted

3

defines the crime of second degree murder as the knowing

4

killing of another.

5

statute does not require that the victim die within any

6

particular period of time, it does not require that the

7

defendant know that the victim will die within any

8

particular time.

9
10

QUESTION:
Chief.

The -- a conviction under that

But statutes often -- I'm sorry,

Go ahead.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I was just going to say, wasn't

12

it assumed by the Tennessee Supreme Court that this was a

13

substantive rule of law, and that you agreed that it was

14

but argued that it had been repealed by the 1989 revision

15

of the statute?

16

GENERAL MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor, our position

17

below was that the rule was a substantive principle of law

18

that had been abolished by operation of our Criminal Code

19

of '89, which said that unless conduct is described as an

20

offense by statute it is no longer an offense, and we

21

argued that the evident purpose of that provision was to

22

abolish all common law crimes, common law elements of

23

crimes --

24

QUESTION:

And the court rejected that argument.

25

GENERAL MOORE:

-- but that position was
24

1

rejected, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

But is it still not correct that you

3

would agree that it's a substantive principle of law, or

4

are you taking a different --

5

GENERAL MOORE:

Our position is that for due

6

process purposes the label one attaches to the rule,

7

whether one calls it a substantive rule, a procedural

8

rule, an evidentiary rule, an elemental rule, whatever

9

label one attaches to it really doesn't make any

10

difference, because the touchstone of due process fair

11

warning in this context, in the retroactivity context, is

12

the violation of a reliance interest of some sort, and

13

because --

14

QUESTION:

Let me ask you just a little

15

refinement of the question.

16

on the view that the 1989 statute had discarded this or

17

changed this substantive rule of law, would you think that

18

you could then have prosecuted someone who had committed

19

the crime before the 1989 statute went into effect?

20
21
22
23
24
25

GENERAL MOORE:

Supposing you had prevailed

Your Honor's hypothetical is if

we had prevailed and the '89 act had -QUESTION:

And then you wanted to indict someone

who had committed the same kind of offense prior to 1989.
GENERAL MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

What

Your Honor's question essentially is, if the legislature
25

1

had effectuated this change, would this be a prohibited ex

2

post facto law.

3

have been, although I must concede that if the rule had

4

been a definitional element of the crime, that would have

5

been an ex post facto violation.

6
7

QUESTION:

10

But there you're placing a label on

it, and I thought the label didn't matter.

8
9

Our contention is that no, it would not

GENERAL MOORE:

Right, and I think labels do

make a difference for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes, if
in --

11

QUESTION:

12

GENERAL MOORE:

13
14

But not for due process purposes.
But not for due process

purposes.
QUESTION:

So your position is, in the

15

hypothetical that I raised with your colleague over there,

16

your position is that if the legislature changed, or our

17

Court changed the law so that the victim no longer has to

18

die, you're guilty of murder, your reliance would have

19

been just the same.

20

struck him with a knife.

21

good luck, not to die.

22

you really think the court could say, we no longer require

23

the victim die for murder?

You intended to kill the person.

You

He just happened, through your

QUESTION:

No reliance interest at all.

I do not.

Why?

Do

GENERAL MOORE:

2

QUESTION:

3
4
5

I think it's because it's an element

of the crime, but why do you think it is?
GENERAL MOORE:

QUESTION:

7

GENERAL MOORE:

9

Well, I -- certainly the death

of the victim is an element of the crime.

6

8

But I think --

Yes.
The timing of the death of the

victim is not an element of the crime.
QUESTION:

Ah, so we do come down to the debate

10

over whether this timing thing here is an element of the

11

crime or not.

12

due process purposes.

13

You've just said that it's irrelevant for

GENERAL MOORE:

I think the due process

14

violation in Your Honor's hypothetical would be that --

15

well, I think first of all, Your Honor's hypothetical

16

assumes that a court may rewrite a statute.

17

Tennessee is not a common law crime.

18

QUESTION:

19

GENERAL MOORE:

20

QUESTION:

Homicide in

All right.
It's a statutory crime.

Change the hypothetical so it isn't a

21

statute, it's a common law crime.

22

mean, the fact is, you have to come back -- in order to

23

avoid my hypothetical you have to fall back on the fact

24

that this is not an element of the crime in this case.

25

it's an element of the crime, I think you're going to
27

It doesn't matter.

I

If

1

lose, unless you're willing to accept the hypothetical I

2

gave you that you can change the law through judicial

3

decision to dispense with the death of the victim.

4

GENERAL MOORE:

I think the change, the

5

alteration in the law posited by Your Honor's hypothetical

6

would be unconstitutional, but not because it violated

7

Bouie's fair warning principle.

8
9

QUESTION:

That's right, so there must be

something beyond Bouie's fair warning principle.

10

GENERAL MOORE:

Well, there is substantive due

11

process.

12

would be unconstitutional for that reason, but I think the

13

retroactivity problem here that is the subject of Mr.

14

Ward's client's complaint is that somehow the retroactive

15

alteration of this principle of law deprived him of some

16

form of fair warning.

17

If it is a wholly irrational change, that indeed

QUESTION:

You're careful to say that this is

18

not a substantive due process violation, and that's the

19

way the question presented is.

20

applies to the States.

21

facto case without any prejudice to your position?

22

I -- the ex post facto law

GENERAL MOORE:

Can we consider this as an ex post

No, Your Honor, I do not think

23

the Court may consider this to be an ex post facto case,

24

because the ex post facto --

25

QUESTION:

No, no, no.
28

Can we debate this case

1

under the Ex Post Facto Clause, or does that depart

2

from --

3

GENERAL MOORE:

Certainly Your Honor may ask me

4

questions concerning whether the Ex Post Facto Clause

5

would be violated if this alteration had been effectuated

6

by the legislature, yes.

7

point --

8
9

QUESTION:

Is that Your -- is Your Honor's

Suppose the Court thinks that it's an

ex post facto violation for the legislature to repeal

10

the -- pardon me, for the Court to abrogate the

11

year-and-a-day rule.

12

isn't it?

13

substantive due process case?

14

That's really what's before us,

Isn't this an ex post facto case rather than a

GENERAL MOORE:

I would disagree with Your

15

Honor, because it would be an ex post facto case if the

16

alteration of the law here had been effectuated by the

17

legislature.

18

technical restrictions of the Ex Post Facto Clause have

19

been imported into the Due Process Clause, but there are

20

numerous reasons why we contend that would be imprudent

21

and, as a matter of history, incorrect.

22

Now, Mr. Ward's argument is that the

QUESTION:

I see.

And this is the way you read

23

Bouie.

Of course, Bouie does have language to the effect

24

that if the legislature can't do it under the Ex Post

25

Facto Clause, neither can the courts, and I would assume
29

1

that the Court in Bouie would have said, because of the Ex

2

Post Facto Clause itself, as well as because of the

3

substantive Due Process Clause, or was it restrained from

4

doing that just because we've always said that ex post

5

facto is for legislatures, not courts?

6

GENERAL MOORE:

Well, I think a combination of

7

the two, but I think Bouie cannot be read to have already

8

accomplished this importation that Mr. Ward suggests this

9

Court ought to adopt in this case.

10

QUESTION:

Well, I think if we prevail for your

11

position we do have to cut back on some of the language in

12

Bouie, do we not?

13

GENERAL MOORE:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Because there is the fact, if we say

15

well, the legislature can't do it under the Ex Post Facto

16

Clause, neither can the courts.

17

GENERAL MOORE:

Well, I think candidly the

18

language to which Your Honor refers is properly

19

characterized as dicta, because in the Bouie opinion

20

Justice Brennan quite clearly located the doctrinal source

21

of his ruling in this Court's Bouie for vagueness

22

jurisprudence.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I think that's a fair argument, but

we have to at least cut back on the dicta.
GENERAL MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor.
30

1

QUESTION:

If that's what it is.

2

GENERAL MOORE:

The State of Tennessee would not

3

object to Your Honors clarifying that point, and I think

4

the point is well taken in Justice Brennan's opinion in

5

that case, is that both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the

6

Due Process Clause of course spring from a common core of

7

concerns about fairness, but obviously the purpose of the

8

Ex Post Facto Clause is as really a structural restraint

9

on the power of the legislative branch.

10

Now, clearly --

11

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt you there for a

12

second?

The clause itself doesn't speak about the

13

legislative branch.

14

such a law, and it's true, of course, that a court

15

normally looks to the past and decides what the law has

16

always been, even though a question has never been

17

decided.

It speaks about, a State may not pass

18

But here, however, it's unusual, because the

19

Tennessee Supreme Court expressly says, we're going to

20

change a substantive rule of law, and is that any

21

different than if it had been exercising, say, its

22

functions to make court rules, or had said, we are now

23

going to pass the following rule, that in murder cases the

24

victim does not have to die within a year.

25

written it out as a rule to be applied in the future, and
31

If they'd

1

somehow had authority to do that and comply with the

2

Tennessee constitution, how would we treat that, as a

3

court rule, or as a legislative rule?

4

GENERAL MOORE:

I think, under this Court's

5

first ex post facto case, Calder v. Bull, the action would

6

still be a judicial act and therefore beyond the scope of

7

the Ex Post Facto Clause.

8
9

If Your Honor will recall, in that case three of
the four justices posited the possibility that the

10

resolution under review there had been adopted by the

11

Connecticut legislature in the exercise of that body's

12

historic powers to operate as a court, and all three of

13

those justices said that if we decide this is a judicial

14

act rather than an act of legislation, it is beyond the

15

words of the Constitution.

16

But in that day of rigorous stare decisis, what

17

they may have meant by a judicial act was a court

18

announcing that this rule of a year and a day was never

19

part of Tennessee law, that our past opinions were

20

erroneous.

21

simply affirming an ambiguous rule.

22

At most they meant that, and maybe they meant

I mean, I think you have to read Calder in the

23

time frame in which it was pronounced.

24

courts who suddenly just jumped up and said oh yes, that

25

used to be the criminal law, but we are changing it.
32

You didn't have

1

GENERAL MOORE:

I would still argue, Your Honor,

2

that the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in this case

3

is in the tradition of the -- of a common law court.

4

common law does evolve, and the first principle of that

5

evolution is that where the reasons for a rule fail, the

6

rule should also fail, and so this --

7

QUESTION:

It really didn't evolve very much at

8

the time of Calder v. Bull.

9

the extent it evolved it, it evolved the good

10

old-fashioned way.

I mean, the courts -- or to

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

They lied about earlier cases.

11

But they certainly didn't just stand

13

up and say, you know, we're changing the law.

14

very rare.

15

The

GENERAL MOORE:

That was

Right, but of course it is our

16

contention, Your Honor, that Calder v. Bull is really

17

beside the point here, because this is a due process case,

18

not an Ex Post Facto Clause case.

19

QUESTION:

May I pursue that just for a second?

20

Assume for the sake of argument here, and you will be

21

willing to do this, I guess, that the year-and-a-day rule

22

is not an element, and assume that the Ex Post Facto

23

Clause has not been totally incorporated and applied to

24

judicial acts.

25

suggested here this morning, it's not a perfect analogy,

One line of analogy that has been

33

1

but it goes part of the way at least, is an analogy with

2

sort of a statute of limitations.

3

What is the rule under due process if a statute

4

of limitations is modified to a defendant's disadvantage

5

after the limitation period has run?

6

that?

7

GENERAL MOORE:

Can a legislature do

I believe, insofar as this

8

Court's jurisprudence is concerned, that the question

9

remains open.

10

I would argue that --

QUESTION:

What's the general rule in the State

11

court, sitting with State due process clauses, or applying

12

the Federal one for that matter?

13

denial of due process in effect to reopen the limitation

14

period after it has run in a defendant's favor?

15

GENERAL MOORE:

Have they held it a

I can only speak to my

16

jurisdiction's case law, and I cannot cite to Your Honor a

17

case that directly addresses that issue under our State

18

constitutional equivalent of the United States or the

19

Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.

20

QUESTION:

Is it acknowledged and accepted that

21

a legislature could not alter an ex -- a statute of

22

limitations, after it has run for a defendant?

23

GENERAL MOORE:

I do not believe that is an

24

accepted proposition.

I believe that if a legislature did

25

it, one would have to measure that law against each of the
34

1

four Calder categories, and it's not really an easy fit

2

under any of those four categories.

3

limitations does not render criminal actions innocent when

4

done.

5

regulate primary conduct at all.

A statute of

It involves -- the statute of limitations doesn't

6

The statute of limitations also involves facts

7

which are sort of wholly collateral to guilt or innocence,

8

so I think it doesn't either aggravate the crime, it

9

doesn't -- quite clearly it doesn't increase the

10

punishment, and because it involves issues that are wholly

11

collateral to guilt or innocence, it's hard to argue that

12

it's a sufficiency-of-the-evidence rule.

13

remedy for a statute of limitations violation would be to

14

dismiss the prosecution altogether, to dismiss the

15

indictment altogether, not to enter a judgment of

16

acquittal.

17

Rather, the

So I think if I were here arguing that case, at

18

least I would have an argument that would pass the smile

19

test.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but even in a statute of

21

limitations case, in a civil action, don't we place a

22

fairly high value on the assurance that a defendant has

23

that his period of jeopardy, his period of exposure to

24

liability is over, and he can simply get on with whatever

25

he wants to do, and I would suppose that that same value
35

1

applies with a greater intensity, or at least as great an

2

intensity in the area of the criminal law, and I -- the

3

analysis so far doesn't seem to be giving any weight to

4

that interest, and I'd like to know why you think that

5

interest is not sufficient to support the petitioner's

6

argument here.

7

GENERAL MOORE:

Because, Your Honor, the

8

year-and-a-day rule is not a rule of repose.

9

purposes at common law really were concerned with --

10

QUESTION:

11

functions that way.

12

None of its

Well, it functions -- it certainly

GENERAL MOORE:

Perhaps it functions that way,

13

but its purposes at common law were wholly unrelated to

14

considerations of repose, or concern with -- concerns with

15

repose, so I don't believe --

16

QUESTION:

They were essentially evidentiary.

I

17

mean, you just couldn't prove the causation reliably after

18

that period.

19

GENERAL MOORE:

Precisely, Your Honor, so I

20

don't believe that petitioner can really claim any

21

expectation interest in repose that derives from the rule.

22

Now, the statute of limitations does protect

23

such concerns but, of course, there is no statute of

24

limitations for murder in Tennessee --

25

QUESTION:

I -36

1

GENERAL MOORE:

-- which reflects a judgment, I

2

believe, that -- by our legislature that murderers should

3

not have any repose.

4

QUESTION:

I think we've held, in connection

5

with a civil case, that a legislature can change the

6

statute of limitations without violating the Due Process

7

Clause.

8
9
10
11

GENERAL MOORE:

Well, that -- certainly that

case law certainly would, I think, support our position
here.
QUESTION:

Why?

Suppose that if you have two

12

statutes in a state, the first forbids attempted murder

13

and has lesser penalties, the second forbids murder, and

14

has greater penalties, and one day the State, the supreme

15

court decides to -- that anyone who's guilty of attempted

16

murder is guilty of murder, because they say there's no

17

difference in the state of mind, et cetera.

18

some reasons.

19
20

They have

Now, could you apply that retroactively?
wouldn't have thought so.

21

GENERAL MOORE:

22

QUESTION:

I

I mean, it seems very unfair.
I don't think so, but I --

All right.

Now, I agree with you.

23

But if that's so, how does this differ?

24

they make the change people think, if I go after somebody

and he survives for a year and a day, it's like attempted
37

I mean, before

1

murder.

2

as I agree with you completely, the first would be

3

fundamentally unfair, why isn't the second?

4

After the change, it's like murder.

GENERAL MOORE:

So if -- if,

Your Honor, I believe that first

5

of all the change here is a change in a rule that does not

6

address either primary conduct or -- and does not

7

eliminate the mens rea with respect to the result of

8

that --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Nor did my example of attempted

murder, murder.
GENERAL MOORE:

And Your Honor's hypothetical is

12

that -- that, if I understand it, that a court would

13

decide that attempted murder equals murder.

14

QUESTION:

You can imagine -- I mean, it's not

15

totally absurd.

It depends on how they're written.

16

have discretion as to sentencing, they say, these notions

17

of punishing by effects are out of date, we should punish

18

by state of mind, the state of mind is identical -- I

19

mean, we can make that up.

20

just moderately absurd.

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

They

It's not totally absurd.

It's

But if it did happen -- if it did

23

happen, which is the point of it, I think we'd say it was

24

fundamentally unfair, and that's why I want to know what

25

the difference is.

To me there is -- I can't find a
38

1

difference.

2

GENERAL MOORE:

Analytically it seems to me

3

there is a large difference, since you have essentially in

4

your hypothetical created or expanded the elements of the

5

crime in a way that affected the primary conduct of the

6

actor.

7

QUESTION:

Ah, we're back to the elements again.

8

You ultimately were driven to the same response to my

9

hypothetical, which was essentially the same as Justice

10

Breyer's.

11

QUESTION:

And it's awfully technical, you see.

12

QUESTION:

Now, in the sense that from the point

13

of view of fairness, really what's happened in my

14

attempted murder, murder case is the difference as to

15

something beyond the control of the defendant, whether the

16

person happened to die, and that seems just what's at

17

stake here, whether we call it an element, or whether we

18

don't call it an element, and that's why it seems a

19

relevant hypothetical.

20

GENERAL MOORE:

I think the year-and-a-day rule,

21

that it is not accurate to characterize the

22

year-and-a-day rule as an element, for a couple of

23

reasons.

24

of Tennessee law, I think it is clear from its opinion

25

indicated that it is not an element of homicide.

First of all, the court below, and as a matter

39

It said,

1

rather, that the effect of its elimination was merely to

2

give the State an opportunity to prove causation, so --

3
4

QUESTION:

Is the ultimate characterization a

matter for the State, or a matter for the Federal courts?

5

GENERAL MOORE:

6

QUESTION:

I think --

I mean, could a State call -- suppose

7

you have the State in Justice Breyer's hypothetical

8

saying, well, the actual death of the victim was not an

9

element of the crime.

10

It was just -- you know, it wasn't

really an element of murder.

11

Now, we'd look at that and we'd say, well, you

12

say that, but come on, that's an element.

13

question for the Federal court, rather than the State,

14

ultimately?

15
16

GENERAL MOORE:

Isn't it a

I would disagree with that.

I

think --

17

QUESTION:

All right.

18

GENERAL MOORE:

19

QUESTION:

Well --

I think the State --

How do you distinguish the

20

year-and-a-day rule from what we held to be an element a

21

couple of terms ago?

22

ago.

25

has nothing to do with the intent of the criminal.

I think it was a couple of terms

2

3

It's after the fact.

We held it was an

Why is that an element and this not an element?
GENERAL MOORE:

Well, I would answer in two

4

ways.

5

element, and it seems to me that is an issue of State law,

6

and in fact the court here said, the lower court here said

7

that it has never been a part of the statutory law of the

8

State.

9

First of all, it is quite plainly not a statutory

Secondly, it is not an element because it is not

10

one of those issues that is submitted to the jury.

11

rather a jurisdictional fact.

12

QUESTION:

It's

My recollection of the case Justice

13

Scalia refers to, which I think is Carmel, is not the same

14

as his.

15

my recollection is that the Court held that the

16

particular -- the hue and cry violated the Ex Post Facto

17

Clause.

18

element of the crime.

I think we were both in dissent in the case, but

I don't know that it said that that was an

GENERAL MOORE:

20

QUESTION:

21

go and read it.

22

was an element.

23

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, I thought -- I -- well, we'll

I thought we -- we said that because it

GENERAL MOORE:

But in either case I don't think

24

the problem with Justice Breyer's hypothetical or Justice

25

Scalia's hypothetical would be one of due process fair
41

1

warning, which is the principle of due process --

2

QUESTION:

Well, can I give you a hypothetical

3

that -- stick to the year-and-a-day rule, because that's

4

what we have before us.

5

there'd been a really terrible crime, he killed a child in

6

a bad situation, but the child didn't die for over a year

7

and a half, or over a year and a day, and the Tennessee --

8

that prompted the Tennessee legislature to abolish that

9

rule, and they said in the rule, abolish it for the past

Supposing just before 1989

10

case too, and they said well, they can't do that, and they

11

say, if we can't do that because of the Ex Post Facto

12

Clause we urge the supreme court to abolish it judicially,

13

and remind them that they all run for reelection if they

14

don't do it, so --

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

And then, sure enough, the case comes

17

up and they decide, well, it's a -- it was a common law

18

rule but we're going to abolish it.

19

be a different rule when it's done by the court rather

20

than by the legislature?

21

case.

22
23
24
25

GENERAL MOORE:

Now, why should there

That's my real question in the

Because of the institutional

differences between courts and legislatures.
QUESTION:

And what is the institutional

difference when the court frankly says, we are making a
42

1
2

new rule of law?

What is the institutional difference?

GENERAL MOORE:

Because of the insulation of

3

that, of the institution of the courts from the same sorts

4

of political pressures that gave rise to the framers'

5

complete distrust of the ability of the legislative branch

6

to legislate in this particular area.

7

Courts not only are insulated from the same

8

sorts of political pressures, but they're subject to a

9

tradition of institutional --

10

QUESTION:

But my hypothetical assumed that

11

there was political pressure.

12

GENERAL MOORE:

13

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor?

My hypothetical assumed that there

14

was political pressure because they have to run for

15

reelection.

16

outraged the public is about this particular crime.

17

They can read the newspapers and see how

GENERAL MOORE:

Well, I think Your Honor's

18

hypothetical posits there is political pressure, but the

19

court, of course, by tradition doesn't succumb to

20

political pressure.

21

(Laughter.)

22

GENERAL MOORE:

And in addition it operates

23

under a set of institutional constraints in the way it

24

goes about doing its business that it seems to me provides

25

important protections here.
43

1

The -- it can't initiate law reform efforts of

2

its own.

It must -- it can only act in the context of

3

cases that the litigants bring before the court.

4

addition, there is stare decisis, and the concomitant

5

imperative that courts justify departures from precedent

6

of the sort Your Honor's hypothetical posits, with

7

reasons, and with some neutral principles of general

8

applicability and some consideration of the impact of the

9

change they're about to make, not only on the litigants

In

10

before them, but on all similarly situated litigants.

11

I think all of those traditional restraints

12

operate to justify different treatment for court decisions

13

as opposed to decisions of legislatures, and certainly the

14

history of the Ex Post Facto Clause indicates that the

15

framers were acutely aware of those distinctions, and

16

because of a well-documented history of parliamentary

17

abuse involving legislation of this sort they thought it

18

essential to insert a prophylactic prohibition against

19

legislation of this sort without regard to -- they weren't

20

going to look into the fairness of individual pieces of

21

legislation and the circumstances under which they were

22

passed.

23

that sort at all.

24
25

They erected a prophylactic bar to legislation of

QUESTION:

But isn't the answer to the

institutional argument that you've been making the answer
44

1

that Justice Scalia has raised a couple of times elsewhere

2

in the argument, that at the time the ex post facto rule

3

was written the way it was, common law courts, or our very

4

conception of courts, even in the Federal system, which

5

was in gestation at that time, involved a system of much

6

stricter precedent than we have today, so the likelihood

7

of a court doing what this court has done was simply much

8

less than it is today.

9

We have an entirely different concept of binding

10

precedent today, and for that reason, shouldn't the Due

11

Process Clause take that into consideration by being

12

starchier in -- than perhaps the founders ever thought

13

there would be a need to be when reviewing judicial

14

change?

15

GENERAL MOORE:

Your Honor, I think the Due

16

Process Clause and the Ex Post Facto Clause also are --

17

serve very different functions under our constitutional

18

scheme.

19

As I indicated, the Ex Post Facto Clause is this

20

sort of structural restraint on the power of that branch

21

of Government, but Due Process, litigation under the Due

22

Process Clause is by its very nature case by case, and the

23

concern of the Due Process Clause is individualized fair

24

treatment, so I would suggest that it would be

25

inconsistent with the nature of the due process guarantee
45

1

to build into it some sort of prophylactic structural

2

restraint on the judicial branch because of concerns that

3

the judicial branch in modern times engages in too much

4

law reform.

5

It seems to me that due process, the Due Process

6

Clause, with its concern about individualized fair

7

treatment, is up to the task of protecting against

8

aberrational cases in which a court is self-evidently

9

engaged in some sort of arbitrary or vindictive action

10

that -- of the sort that violates our notions of

11

fundamental fairness and our notions about the rule of

12

law.

13

To close, our position is that the Due Process

14

Clause was not violated here, and that the Due Process

15

Clause is not violated by a court decision of this sort

16

that retroactively alters a rule of criminal law unless

17

that change expands the scope of conduct covered by the

18

criminal prohibition issue and does so unforeseeably.

19

Secondarily, our position is that the Ex Post

20

Facto Clause simply doesn't regulate judicial action at

21

all, and that none of its technical restrictions should be

22

imported wholesale into the Due Process Clause.
