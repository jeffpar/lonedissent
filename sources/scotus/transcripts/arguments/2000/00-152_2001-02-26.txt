This case comes on a second time for review

18

before this Court following the initial petition for

19

granting petition for certiorari in 1999, when the Court

20

vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and sent the

21

case back for reconsideration under this Court's decision

22

in American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v.

23

Sullivan.

We argued at that time that the decision of the
Ninth Circuit was a radical departure from established

1

principles of constitutional law, and the cases decided

2

under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,

3

and the Court, we would submit, has only paid lip service

4

to this Court's decision in Sullivan and again renders a

5

decision which compounds confusion in the law and is again

6

a radical departure.

7

The Ninth Circuit again takes the position that

8

any interest or any declaim for payment under a public

9

works contract is a property interest within the meaning

10

of the Fourteenth Amendment.

11

viewpoint which is contrary to every other circuit that

12

has decided that question, including the Second District

13

and the Court of Appeals in the First and Seventh

14

Circuits.

15

That is a decision and a

Also, in the Ninth Circuit the position has been

16

for a number of years, as reflected in San Bernadino

17

Physicians Services, that these types of interests in

18

construction contracts, public construction contracts,

19

were not within the concept of property within the Due

20

Process Clause.

21

This Court in Sullivan made it clear that in

22

order to determine that there was a property interest,

23

that a plaintiff had to pass certain minimum standards,

24

had to surmount certain hurdles of pleading and evidence

25

that were never surmounted in this case and it is clear in

QUESTION:

Mr. Kerrigan, has the California law

changed since this case came about?

5

MR. KERRIGAN:

There is, as we pointed out in

6

our brief, Your Honor, the legislature has enacted some

7

new laws which --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Under the new law, can the State

labor department require the withholding by the contractor
from the sub?

11

MR. KERRIGAN:

There are some instances under

12

the new law where the DLSE, the Division of Labor

13

Standards Enforcement, can require a withholding.

14

QUESTION:

But the law at the time this case

15

arose was different, and there was no requirement -- the

16

labor department couldn't require the withholding, is that

17

right?

18

MR. KERRIGAN:

Under the law that existed at

19

this time, the only party who is required to withhold was

20

the awarding body, the State agency.

21

the general contractor, the prime contractor was not

22

required to withhold.

Now --

4

party?

5

MR. KERRIGAN:

After all, the prime

What prime would want to keep

Well, to start with the very

6

obvious, Justice Ginsburg, there would be the situation

7

where the prime doesn't owe any money to the sub.

8

get the withholding notice, there's nothing to withhold.

9

That's a very obvious example.

They

There are also examples,

10

for instance, where the situation of the subcontractor

11

would be such that if there was a withholding it would put

12

him out of business, and it might be in the interest of

13

the prime contractor not to put the sub out of business

14

because it might jeopardize performance under the

15

contract.

That is another example.

16

QUESTION:

Do you know if practically these -- I

17

know you -- are possibilities.

18

MR. KERRIGAN:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

Practically, has there ever been a

2

in fact that has occurred, yes.

3

QUESTION:

Because there would be a penalty.

4

It's not just that the wages would be withheld, but there

5

would be a penalty imposed, a daily penalty, isn't that --

6
7

MR. KERRIGAN:

There would be.

The law requires

that.

8

QUESTION:

So it could mount up pretty high.

9

MR. KERRIGAN:

Depending on the nature of the

10

violation, it certainly could, and some of these

11

violations are very substantial, and the amounts of money

12

are very substantial.

13

QUESTION:

Even if there were no statutory

14

provision authorizing the prime to withhold, wouldn't it

15

be true, under the law of contract in, I assume every

16

State, that under the circumstances of this case the prime

17

could withhold anyway, because the contract law is assumed

18

to be made to incorporate whatever positive legal

19

obligations there are, and if there is a positive legal

20

obligation on the part of the sub to pay a prevailing

21

wage, and the sub is not doing it, couldn't the prime say,

22

you are breaching the contract to that extent, and because

23

I can be sued I'm going to protect myself by withholding

24

something from my payment to you?

25

MR. KERRIGAN:

That is indeed the case, and

that's been the history of the construction industry.

QUESTION:

he was wrong about whether the sub was in breach or not.

4
5

He can do it, but he'd be liable if

MR. KERRIGAN:

He -- absolutely.

He would be

absolutely be liable.

6

QUESTION:

In other words, he'd be accepting on

7

faith the State's determination that the sub was in

8

breach, and if he was wrong about it he'd be liable for

9

damages.

10

MR. KERRIGAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

That's the only way to read --

Isn't he also going to have to pay

the sub in this case if the State is wrong?

13

MR. KERRIGAN:

14

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Sure, so my question is, if the

15

authorization in the statute is a key to a determination

16

that there is State action here, wouldn't the general law

17

of contract be an equal key, even if this provision did

18

not exist?

19

MR. KERRIGAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

put it another way.

22

when he is doing absolutely -- the prime is doing

23

absolutely nothing more than the prime could do under the

24

general law of contract?

25

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. KERRIGAN:

The relationship of the prime and

4

the sub in this industry, and as far as -- and as long as

5

this industry has existed, has been that if there are

6

situations of this kind under custom and practice, the

7

prime withholds.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

You would accept that argument?

MR. KERRIGAN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Chief Justice.

17

QUESTION:

And did they ever sue in any

18

California court to recover what they claim to have been

19

owed?

20

MR. KERRIGAN:

Not only did they not sue, they

21

never submitted any kind of a claim that we're aware of.

22

They never reduced any kind of a claim to writing that

23

we're aware of, and when we talk about a claim in this

case we're talking about something that's an abstraction,

California court.
QUESTION:

May I ask a further question on that?

3

Have they ever represented that they did, in fact, comply

4

with the statutes concerning the level of compensation?

5

MR. KERRIGAN:

Never.

Never, and there's

6

nothing in the record where they ever made the claim that

7

they complied with the prevailing wage requirements, or

8

any other conditions of the contract.

9

the record, and we've been in front of the Ninth Circuit

There's nothing in

10

three times on this, we've been in the district court two

11

or three times, and there's no such claim.

12

Now, one of the other questionable, we suggest,

13

determinations of the Ninth Circuit was that a cause of

14

action, a trial in a court of law was not a hearing within

15

the meaning of due process, that somehow there was some

16

requirement that the hearing had to be an administrative

17

hearing, and we believe that that is contrary to the

18

decisions of this Court in cases like Hudson v. Palmer,

19

and Ingraham v. Wright, where the Court at least in those

20

cases suggested that a trial in a court of law was,

21

indeed, a hearing within the meaning of due process.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask you on that question -- I

23

understand they haven't done it, but is there an

24

administrative procedure in which they could have said,

1

everything we're supposed to do, or do they have to sue?

2

MR. KERRIGAN:

There is -- certainly that could

3

have been done informally, and there's certainly

4

communications between the parties.

5

administrative procedure at that time.

6
7

QUESTION:

Is there -- under the amended

statute, is there such a procedure?

8
9

There was no such

MR. KERRIGAN:

There was a temporary regulation

put in effect during the course of this appeal that has

10

been utilized prospectively, and there have been a number

11

of hearings under that regulation, but there was none at

12

this time.

13

QUESTION:

It's pretty high-handed, don't you

14

think?

I mean, the State, without giving the sub even a

15

chance to respond to these allegations simply directs the

16

prime contractor to give the State the money owed to the

17

sub?

18

makes it a little different from the ordinary contract

19

case.

It's a kind of garnishment, I guess, and that's what

20

MR. KERRIGAN:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Well --

The way the statute reads, what you

must pay to the State is the money owing to the sub.
MR. KERRIGAN:

Justice Scalia, we would say it

24

is completely different than a garnishment.

25

there is a spectrum of situations that one would pose in
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

We would say

1

these cases.

2

of the spectrum cases that like the James Good Realty, the

3

Hawaiian case, where a party was divested of real property

4

interest.

5

You have on the far end of the, extreme end

You have the Sniadach case, where there was a

6

garnishment, where property is in possession of the --

7

let's say, the subcontractor, and that property is

8

divested and the right is divested.

9

This is a situation where there are two parties,

10

one party claims that the other party is not entitled to

11

the property, or in this case the money, and the other

12

party is claiming that they are entitled to the money.

13

think it's perfectly reasonable, especially in view of the

14

well-known insolvency of the subcontractors, that for the

15

protection of the workers on these projects, that the

16

withholding is appropriate.

17

We

And Justice Stevens in Sullivan said, and I

18

think that -- as we said in our brief, I think that

19

philosophy kind of tends to underscore the decision in

20

Sullivan that there is nothing unreasonable if a party in

21

good faith, who has possession of the property or the

22

goods, takes the position that they're going to hold onto

23

that property to preserve the status quo until some kind

24

of a reasonable determination can be made, and we don't

25

think it's high-handed.

QUESTION:

But the one difference is, as Justice

2

Scalia points out, it isn't the prime that made the

3

decision to do this.

4

enforcement agency said, you pay over -- Mr. Prime, you

5

pay over to the State what would otherwise be paid to the

6

sub.

7

It's the State agency, the

MR. KERRIGAN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

8

it isn't like a garnishment, where there is a clear

9

entitlement, property interest in the property or money.

10

Here there's a disputed claim, and that's all

11

there is, and we are saying, based on the disputed claim,

12

we're not going to pay you for the box of ballpoint pens

13

that the supplier gave us.

14

payment on that.

15

We're going to withhold

If, every time the State does not pay its bills

16

on time because there's a dispute, a good-faith dispute,

17

and if that's going to be a violation of the Due Process

18

Clause, we don't think that's what was intended by the

19

people who drafted the Due -- the Fourteenth Amendment.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I guess there was a good-faith

21

dispute in Roth as to whether the employee could be

22

dismissed or not.

23

and we said you couldn't do it without a prior hearing.

24

How do you distinguish Roth from the ordinary contract

25

case?

MR. KERRIGAN:

Well, as this Court has said in

2

Sullivan and almost every other case, the first inquiry is

3

always the nature and extent of the property right, if

4

any, and you can't get to that point in this case or any

5

other case until you've determined that there is a

6

property right within the meaning of the Due Process

7

Clause.

QUESTION:

And if I have someone who owes me

under a contract, I have a valid contract claim against

10

somebody, the State can take that away, and they have

taken away property?

Surely that's not right.

the interest of the State and because of the workers who

would be affected, and because of the notorious insolvency

of subcontractors, that it's an appropriate mechanism.

11

held that there was no property interest because he didn't

13

In cases like Loudermill, where the person could

not be dismissed and had a guaranteed right to continued

before they could dismiss him for cause, and a person in

No, because one of the rights -- in

law and the contracts provide that the immediate right to

payment doesn't attach in cases of dispute until the

19

plaintiff has proven his entitlement, so in this case the

cause -- the lawsuit is the mechanism by which entitlement

21

is proved, so that would not establish a present property

QUESTION:

13

MR. LAMKEN:

You're -What going to court does is, it may

I thought your position on your brief

the labor code gives the prime contractor a right to seek

Well, but that, this section 1729

doesn't say that.

You're saying --

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

16

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Chief.

No, I take it --

17

you're saying that, I take it, that the reference that the

18

language on account of failure simply refers to the reason

19

given by the State for withholding, as opposed to the fact

20

of failure or nonfailure.

21

MR. SEIDEMAN:

Well, right, and in either event,

22

even if you had the right to sue the prime contractor, you

23

still have the problem that you have enforcement officials

24

that can cut off your payments without any hearing right,

QUESTION:

Oh, I grant you that, but I mean,

2

what we were trying to get at is, whether you had a cause

3

of action that you could assert in a California court, and

4

your answer is, no, I don't, because even if I prove to

5

the court's satisfaction, the fact-finder's satisfaction

6

that I have paid the prevailing rate, so long as the prime

7

can show that the State is with -- or the public authority

8

is withholding payment because the State claims I didn't,

9

that is a defense.

10
11

That's your position.

MR. SEIDEMAN:

Well, yes, and therefore that's

why I don't think the court would even litigate --

12

QUESTION:

But Mr. Seideman, what were the suits

13

that you brought?

14

You refer to prior cases, and you say, a State court

15

ordered G & G and DLSE to mediate, and a settlement was

16

reached.

17

were availing yourself of under State law and State court.

18

What was it?

19

I'm looking at your brief, at page 3.

There must have been some procedure that you

MR. SEIDEMAN:

We were suing under the labor

20

code, it's a labor code lawsuit that you're allowed to get

21

the money back.

The problem, the due process problem --

And that allows you to file a suit.
Yes, and if you're a

subcontractor -QUESTION:

Against whom?

Against whom, the

labor department?
MR. SEIDEMAN:

Well, no.

It's nominally the

11

awarding body, but the real party in interest is the DLSE,

12

who defends the lawsuit.

13

QUESTION:

Well, is that not adequate

14

post-deprivation relief, even if you assume there's some

15

State action and some problem?

16

MR. SEIDEMAN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SEIDEMAN:

No, Your Honor.

Why?
Because when you have a seizure

19

by enforcement officials, something is forfeited for a

20

violation of law, the Court has stated in prior cases that

21

there needs to be some type of a right to at least a

22

prompt post-deprivation hearing to determine if there's a

23

basis of probable validity for the seizure.

24

QUESTION:

Well, here's a right to a

25

post-deprivation proceeding.

MR. SEIDEMAN:

Right, because all of the

money --

4

QUESTION:

Why?

5

MR. SEIDEMAN:

Because even if it's completely

6

baseless, the DLSE action, completely meritless baseless

7

action, the procedure is, all the money is held until the

8

completion of the lawsuit and appellate rights, so they

9

can hold money for 3 years.

QUESTION:

Could the prime make the same

11

argument, constitutional argument that you're making on

12

behalf of the sub?

13

15

MR. SEIDEMAN:

We contend we are -- we've always

contended we are a prime contractor and a subcontractor.
QUESTION:

All right, so whether he's a prime or

16

a sub makes no difference for purposes of the argument

you're presenting to us here?

QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I --

Would you mind telling us just what

21

post-deprivation remedy, if we assume there is some

problem here, was open to the respondent subcontractor?

23

MR. KERRIGAN:

There were a number, Your Honor.

24

There was, for instance, the remedy under 1733, which is

25

the labor code section.

That section says the contractor

or its assignee may bring a lawsuit within 90 days.

2
3

QUESTION:

Is he an assignee automatically,

because he's the subcontractor?

4

MR. KERRIGAN:

There is a case that came down --

5

it came down since this case was first argued, which

6

says -- it's called J & K Painting.

7

but I would refer you to footnote number 7, which seems to

8

suggest that they would be an assignee in law if the

9

assignment wasn't given.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KERRIGAN:

It's in our brief,

That's how I would read it, too.
And as a matter of reality, there

12

is no reason for the prime contractor not to assign.

The

13

prime contractor doesn't want any part of this suit.

They

have no economic interest in --

QUESTION:

Well, don't -- please continue to

answer.

17

MR. KERRIGAN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

I want to know -- the big allegation

19

is, they have no adequate post-deprivation remedy, and

20

their lawyer, as I understand it, is saying it would take

21

3 years to reach closure on it, so what is your response?

22

MR. KERRIGAN:

That is not the case, Your Honor.

23

There is a stop-notice provision.

24

provision is in the code.

25

36-37 of our brief.

The stop-notice

hearing.

The G & G type contractor files a stop notice

2

with the State, the State withholds money from the prime

3

contractor, and there is a hearing in a very short period

4

of time.

5

In addition --

6

QUESTION:

When I was reading that provision, it

7

wasn't clear to me that it applied in this situation

8

anywhere -- was there any finding about what that stop

9

order, and some other suggestions you had, would do?

10

MR. KERRIGAN:

11

QUESTION:

There are --

I thought that the law itself said

12

that this is the only remedy that the remedy of the prime

13

or its assignee suing was the only remedy, was the

14

exclusive remedy.

some words in the labor code to that effect?
MR. KERRIGAN:

Well, that, you told us, says that

the assignment is deemed in law to have occurred.

evils that -54

1

QUESTION:

But isn't there something in the

2

labor code involved in this very complex of statutes that

3

says that that action by the prime or its assignee is the

4

only remedy?

5

MR. KERRIGAN:

I believe what you're referring

6

to, Justice, is the provision in the statute that says no

7

other issues will be considered than the issue of the

8

entitlement to the money.

9

and there are -- one of the things that the Ninth Circuit

It is not the exclusive remedy,

10

said is, well, there aren't a lot of cases involving these

11

subcontractors in a public work situations under the law

12

of contracts, under the law of stop notices.

13

The reason is, is because there's almost always

14

an assignment, and the action proceeds under 1733, and --

15

QUESTION:

I think she's referring to 1732,

16

which says, notwithstanding any other provision of law,

17

and then jumping to the end of it, and suit on the

18

contract that is against the awarding for alleged breach

19

thereof and not making the payment is the exclusive remedy

20

of the contractor or his or her assignees, and you say

21

that means him, with reference to those wages or

22

penalties.

23

MR. KERRIGAN:

Well, the J & K Painting Company

24

case says to the contrary, Your Honor, and we would submit

25

it on that.

We would submit -- that's our case.
