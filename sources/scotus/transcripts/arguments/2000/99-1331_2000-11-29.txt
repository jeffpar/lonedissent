ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY C. DRIPPS, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DRIPPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Both the Jones Act and the Limited Liability Act

12

can and should be given effect in this single-claimant

13

case, yet respondent seeks to use the Limited Liability

14

Act to destroy rights conferred by Congress on Lewis as a

15

seaman.

16

Federal Employers Liability Act guaranteeing the employee

17

a choice of a State or Federal forum.

18

guarantees him the freedom from removal to Federal court

19

in the event he chooses a State court forum.

The Jones Act incorporates the provisions of the

QUESTION:

In addition, it

That's true of both the Jones Act and

FELA, is it?
MR. DRIPPS:

Yes, sir, and that statutory remedy

23

is saved to Lewis by the saving to suitors clause, yet it

24

can only be preserved in this case by dissolving the

25

injunction against State court proceedings.

This Court's

1

decision in the 1931 Langnes case held that the

2

injunction, even without stipulations, should be dissolved

3

to allow the State court suit to proceed, and that the

4

admiralty court would resume jurisdiction only in the

5

event that the State court judgment exceeded the amount of

6

the limitation fund.

7

QUESTION:

Well, under what circumstances could

8

the district court exercise its discretion and not

9

dissolve the injunction and require litigation of

10
11

liability in Federal court?
MR. DRIPPS:

Justice O'Connor, it would be only

12

in a multiple-claimant excess fund situation, and even

13

then under the Jones Act there might be a question with

14

regard to preserving multiple suitors claims under the

15

Jones Act, but generally in a non-Jones Act multiple-

16

claimant excess fund situation the vessel owner does have

17

the right to maintain the exclusive jurisdiction of the

18

admiralty court.

19

QUESTION:

20

multiple, and the Jones Act?

21

Jones Act would prevent a liability determination in all

22

of those situations?

23

MR. DRIPPS:

Well, what if you have excess funds,
Are you saying that the

Not necessarily.

I'm saying that

24

it's a question that potentially could be raised, but it

25

hasn't been.

That's, of course, not this case.

This is a

1

single-claimant case, and part of the court's discretion

2

at the district court level certainly was finding that it

3

could be a single-claimant case, which the district court

4

order did note in footnote 3.

5

QUESTION:

6

Do you think that the courts and rule

(f) preclude a single-claimant exception?

7

MR. DRIPPS:

Oh, absolutely not, Justice

8

O'Connor.

9

case, because in the Langnes case the district court in

10

fact exonerated the vessel owner, and were that -- were

11

rule (f) to preclude dissolution of the injunction,

12

certainly the court would have simply relied on the

13

exoneration finding.

14
15
16

I think that was made clear in the Langnes

QUESTION:

But you think that rule (f) is

invalid?
MR. DRIPPS:

I do.

However, and I want to make

17

this clear, the Court need not reach that issue if it

18

simply follows the Langnes analysis.

19

Act analysis only comes into play in this case if the

20

respondent's position is adopted, in that they say that we

21

have no right to go to State court.

22

forced to attack the rule which gives them the right to

23

have a liability and damage determination made in the

24

Federal court, which I do say is invalid as violation of

25

the rulemaking powers of this Court.

The Rules Enabling

At that point, I am

1

QUESTION:

But it's possible to rule for you

2

here without holding that rule (f) is invalid just as a

3

matter of interpretation, isn't it?

4

MR. DRIPPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I agree

5

completely that if the Court simply follows the Langnes

6

case and says that the Jones Act allows this case to be

7

brought in State court, and that that statutory remedy is

8

preserved by the saving to suitors clause, and that the

9

injunction should be dissolved on that basis, the Court

10

need not reach the issue of the invalidity of rule (f) in

11

this case.

12

QUESTION:

But it might not -- but it might not

13

go that far if you had a mass disaster and there were many

14

sailors injured and the vessel wasn't worth enough to

15

cover all the claims.

16

MR. DRIPPS:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that in

17

that case the plain language of the limitation statute in

18

anything other than fire requires the vessel owner to

19

admit liability and cannot use the limitation statute as a

20

method to shift the forum and then contest liability.

21

shipowner has a choice of one or the other in that

22

circumstance.

23

QUESTION:

How does it work in practice?

The

You

24

have a single claimant, and there's adequate, adequate

25

funds to cover the claim and it goes to the State court.

Then 6 weeks later somebody else has a slip and fall, and

then there's another suit.

to me that there's great merit to your position, but that

5

on the other hand there's going to be problems down the

line when you have subsequent claims, or is that maybe not

7

a problem?

8
9

Does that make everything

MR. DRIPPS:

How does this work in -- it seems

Justice Kennedy, I don't believe

that's a problem, because normally when you have a case

10

like this you have separate or serial funds.

11

the vessel owner wishes to file a limitation case there's

12

a separate valuation made, and it's a separate proceeding.

13

Each time

Now, the seaman's claims will become liens in

14

priority of the time they arise, but that's a separate

15

issue, and I --

16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

Okay, so the priority is what solves

the problem, then.
MR. DRIPPS:

Exactly.

There's a priority based

on chronology.

20

QUESTION:

And also --

21

QUESTION:

A chronology of when the claim was

22
23

filed, or when the injury occurred?
MR. DRIPPS:

I believe that it is of the time of

the judgment, except for wages, when it's a -- wages are a

25

lien that accrue as of the time -7

1

QUESTION:

Well, then I think there might be a

2

problem with successive claims.

3

It's in the background, it seems to me, of the rule we

4

must make, because if we ship it all off to the State

5

court, and then there are going to be subsequent claims,

6

you might have to start the -- stop the State proceeding

7

midway.

8

MR. DRIPPS:

We need not get into it.

Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe

9

that would only be a problem if the vessel owner tenders

10

the vessel to a trustee rather than posting security for

11

value, which is what was done in this case.

12

If, in fact, the vessel is turned over to a

13

trustee, though, the likelihood is that it's not going to

14

be employed by the owner, and so that owner won't be

15

allowed to have a subsequent claim, and if they post

16

security for value, I think that solves the problem,

17

because there is a fund posted, and we won't be in a

18

situation where we have competing claims for the same

19

fund.

In other words, they will be different funds.

20

QUESTION:

Do I understand the limitation

21

correctly?

I mean, the typical use would be if you have a

22

collision and lots of people are hurt, but this is a

23

single -- this is a tripping on wire, so we know it

24

isn't -- it isn't disputed in this case, is it, that we're

25

dealing with a single-sailor accident?

2

MR. DRIPPS:

There is no dispute concerning

3

that, Justice Ginsburg.

In the motion to dissolve the

4

restraining order, which is in the joint appendix on page

5

70, and I believe it's at page 71, paragraph 6, Lewis made

6

the specific claim that this was a single-claimant

7

accident.

8

contradicted by the opposing side, by the vessel owner, so

9

this is clearly a single-claimant case.

10

That claim has never been rebutted or

Now, what your question suggests then, is why

11

was this case filed, and it was filed simply as a forum-

12

shifting device.

13

QUESTION:

But you sued later.

Oh, you think

14

that they came in precipitously so that the forum would be

15

where they wanted it, rather than where you chose to sue?

use the term precipitously, but the complaint was filed on

concession that if only you had asked for a jury trial

saved.

18

MR. DRIPPS:

And I think the Linton case from

the Fifth Circuit in 1992 addresses that point

specifically, Justice Ginsburg, and they say that the

it's quite another, a separate thing for Congress to say

14

And that ties in with this Court's decision in

case their Federal statutory rights are fully protected,

conferred upon us in the Jones Act and preserved from the

Well, what have you conceded with

Do I correctly understand the picture

11

the function is served by the defense that the shipowner

can put into the Jones Act claim that is, there was no

negligence here, and that is effectively what the

14

exoneration plea would do?

15

MR. DRIPPS:

In some ways, Justice Ginsburg.

16

Now, if I understand the question correctly, I don't

17

believe that the exoneration rule is an incorporation of

18

Congress' allowing them a defense under the Jones Act.

19

think that defense has to be taken in the context of the

statute, and they can choose to defend and require us to

put on our proof of negligence, but only in the context of

3

It's a respondeat superior situation.

That's one

Another thing is, there was no negligence by

4

anybody at all, and I thought that that was the equivalent

5

of the exoneration plea, that nobody was negligent at all,

6

as distinguished from, maybe we have respondeat superior

7

liability, but we should be allowed to limit that.

8
9

MR. DRIPPS:

That's true, that is the essence of

the exoneration claim, and that's what they want the

10

Federal court to decide.

11

first of all, the Langnes case from this Court essentially

12

held that the exoneration claim was not sufficient to

13

preclude dissolution of the injunction because, as I noted

14

earlier, in Langnes the district court had, in fact,

15

exonerated the vessel owner.

16

required the injunction to be dissolved and the case to go

17

back to State court.

18

QUESTION:

The two responses to that are,

This Court nonetheless

Well, that I don't follow, because if

19

there was a determination of exoneration, that is, no

20

liability at all, not limited but no liability at all, why

21

wouldn't that have been preclusive in State court?

22
23

MR. DRIPPS:

If it had not been reversed by this

preclusive of the exoneration claim in Federal court under

9

QUESTION:

But if the Federal court had made the

10

determination first, and that -- and hadn't been reversed,

11

then that would be preclusive.

12

MR. DRIPPS:

Yes, it would, but the Court

13

reversed it because the determination should have been

14

made by the State court in the first instance rather than

15

the Federal court, and that's the essence of the Langnes

16

holding, that we're implementing the Jones Act's grant to

17

the seamen, preserved through the saving to suitors

18

clause, of the right to proceed in State court, rather

19

than be forced into Federal court by the shipowner, and

20

that holding was made without the presence of any

21

stipulations regarding res judicata, and this Court said

22

that the case will go back to State court for that

23

determination.

the equivalent of getting, in the Federal court,

They have the right in State court to defend,

They will be getting in the State court the

Federal court.
They are not being deprived of any rights by

proceeding in State court, and their Federal right of

13

limitation will be guaranteed to them by the stipulations

that we filed waiving res judicata with regard to the

15

issue of limited liability and stipulating to the

exclusive jurisdiction of the district court to decide the

and their right to defend and require proof of negligence

things they can assert in the State court.

Those protect their Federal rights,

The other reason that the exoneration rule

should not be permitted to control disposition of this

Yes, Your Honor, and that's why I

say that if the Court adopts the analysis that the

respondent has offered, then we need to grapple with the

Rules Enabling Act analysis, and in that case the

MR. DRIPPS:

Well, normally, Justice Ginsburg, I

would agree with you that that is what the rules do.

13

this particular case, however, this Court's decision in

14

the Benefactor specifically said that the fifty-sixth rule

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES V. O'BRIEN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. O'BRIEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The issue that is presented on certiorari grant
from this Court in this case is whether the district court

10

in this case abused its discretion in lifting the

11

injunction that was imposed upon the filing of the

12

limitation of liability case and allowing the claimant to

13

proceed with a nonjury case in Illinois State court, where

14

he was a single claimant in the limitation and where the

15

fund was, at least after the initial filing, deemed

16

adequate.

17

The Eighth Circuit answered this question in the

18

affirmative, and held that since the remedy sought by the

19

claimant, a nonjury trial, was already available in the

20

limitation of liability court, that there was no saved

21

remedy.

22

the claimant implicated, and therefore the Federal

23

district court in the limitation case was bound by its

24

grant of jurisdiction under Article 3, section 2 --

1

court's view would have been different had the right to

2

jury trial not been given up?

3

MR. O'BRIEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, our position in

4

the case, and I believe the position of the Eighth Circuit

5

was that if a jury trial had been requested, then a remedy

6

that was not available in the district court would have

7

been sought and therefore a saved remedy would have been

8

sought, and therefore the stay, assuming the single

9

claimant exception and the adequate fund exceptions were

10

met, would have been allowed to proceed in Illinois State

11

court.

12

QUESTION:

So this case hinges, in your view at

13

any rate, on the fact that the plaintiff had waived the

14

right to a jury trial.

15

MR. O'BRIEN:

16
17

To a large extent it does.

If I

may -QUESTION:

You say that because you say, well

18

then he doesn't need the State forum because he can get a

19

nonjury trial in admiralty, but wouldn't one say equally,

20

once the Jones Act plaintiff stipulates that he's not

21

going to seek more than X amount of damages, you don't

22

need the limitation proceeding?

23

MR. O'BRIEN:

Our position takes a step back,

24

and our position looks back at the original origin of the

25

single claimant exception that was set forth by this Court

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

in Langnes v. Green, and what we say is that we know a

2

number of things about what this Court -- what the

3

district courts have to do under the Limitation of

4

Liability Act.

5

Unlike some of the cases cited by the

6

petitioner, where there is no limitation case, we know

7

that when there's a limitation case on file there is

8

exclusive Federal jurisdiction, and we know that the

9

district courts are therefore bound to -- exclusively to

10

administer the rights of the limitation claimant and

11

all -- the limitation petitioner, excuse me, and all those

12

claimants who make claim.

13

The only way for any given claimant to exit from

14

the limitation case is if they can, for lack of a better

15

word, trump the limitation petitioner's rights to an

16

exclusive determination in the Federal court with some

17

statutory right, and in this case that would be -- the

18

source of that right would be 28 U.S.C. section 1333, the

19

saving to suitors clause.

20

Now --

21

QUESTION:

I'd like to back up a little bit,

22

because I don't think I followed you that far down the

23

trail.

25

be able to limit the extent of his economic loss to the

value of the ship.
Now, once it is certain that that will in fact

3

be the case, that there is no exposure beyond the value of

4

the ship, what function does a limitation proceeding

5

save -- serve, other than to block what would ordinarily

6

be a garden-variety Jones Act case from proceeding in

7

whatever forum the sailor chooses to sue in?

8
9

MR. O'BRIEN:

Because the Limitation of

Liability Act has more than just to limit liability.

It

10

also has the purpose of allowing an exoneration to be

11

pursued by the shipowner and, indeed, in Langnes v. Green,

12

the seminal case that started this exception, the Court

13

was very clear, this Court was very clear that the

14

limitation court had both the power to decide exoneration

15

and limitation.

16

Now --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

What provision of the limitation act

gives you the right to have an exoneration proceeding?
MR. O'BRIEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that

20

the entire act construed by this Court in the Norwich v.

21

Wright case provides that right.

22

183, but also read in conjunction with section 185 and the

23

entire statute.

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, the

statute itself, of course, is in the United States Code,

5

and under section 183 of title 46 the vessel owner is

6

entitled to pursue the limitation of liability, and is --

7

QUESTION:

But pursuing the limitation of

8

liability is one thing.

Getting an exoneration

9

determination is another.

10

MR. O'BRIEN:

Yes, sir.

11

Your Honor, going back to Norwich v. Wright,

12

this Court on at least a dozen occasions since 1871 has

13

decided that exoneration is a fundamental right under the

14

statute and is part and parcel of the limitation

15

proceeding.

16

QUESTION:

Were any of those cases single-

17

claimant cases where the fund was adequate to cover the

18

injury, or were they all what one thinks of as limitation

19

case, a rather larger disaster?

20

MR. O'BRIEN:

The early cases, Justice Ginsburg,

21

typically involved a petition to limit after a judgment

22

had already been obtained in a district court.

23

the Norwich case that is the case cited in both briefs,

24

and the original seminal case in limitation liability,

25

involved such a proceeding, and the Benefactor, the second

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

Indeed,

1

case after Norwich, also involved a shipowner that came in

2

after a finding of liability in the district court.

3

But when those early decisions came out

4

construing the Limitation of Liability Act, for the first

5

time -- it had been passed in 1851 -- they had to decide

6

what it meant, and there is an extended discussion in

7

Norwich v. Wright about it, and in that case this Court

8

stated that the American Limitation of Liability Act

9

represented a departure from English law, because the

10

English chancery courts, which had earlier heard

11

limitation cases in England, lacked the power to

12

investigate claims in admiralty, and therefore under

13

English admiralty law the shipowner was required to admit

14

liability.

15

In the American courts, and under the limitation

16

act as construed by this Court in Norwich v. Wright, a

17

determination not only of limitation was undertaken, but

18

also exoneration, and from that time forward --

19

QUESTION:

But wasn't that only on the

20

assumption that there was jurisdiction under -- just to

21

seek limitation?

seek exoneration, but was there any case where the only

issue was exoneration versus liability?

QUESTION:

And the word exoneration is not in

the statute itself, is it?

3

MR. O'BRIEN:

It is not found in the statute,

4

although it does state -- the statute does state that the

5

vessel owner's liability shall not exceed the value of the

6

vessel --

7

QUESTION:

Right, but that's quite different

8

from saying it shall not exist.

9

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, it also does not deny the

10

district court -- the same statute that gives the

11

jurisdiction to decide limitation of liability does not

12

deny to the district court the ability to decide

13

exoneration.

14

QUESTION:

But wouldn't all these cases fit

15

together if we simply held that in an appropriate case

16

where the limitation of liability proceeding involves

17

multiple claimants and an original intent to get more

18

than the gross value of the ship, that in such a case,

19

the -- among the things the shipowner can do is seek a

20

complete defense of a nonliability?

21

that on the Court, and I believe it's part of the

seek exoneration in any case in which it seeks a

limitation as well.

QUESTION:

6

The Norwich, for example, under the

Norwich was decided long before the Jones act was passed.

7

MR. O'BRIEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you think the Jones Act affects

the holding in Norwich in any way?
MR. O'BRIEN:

We do not.

It's clear that the

11

rights that the seaman has under the Jones Act are

12

subordinate to -- in general to the rights of the

13

shipowner to limit liability.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. O'BRIEN:

In other words --

Now, why do you say that?
Because -- for the reason that

16

it's clear that if it had been a limitation proceeding

17

with multiple claimants in a case where the claims

18

asserted exceeded the value of the vessel --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Yes, but Langnes says the single

claimant is different, does it not?
MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, what -- Langnes really rests

22

upon three distinct factors.

Langnes says, first you have

23

to have a limitation of liability case.

24

second, you have to have a single claimant, and third you

25

have to have a request for a jury trial.
28

Langnes says

Those, in our

1

view, are the three pillars upon which that case was

2

decided, and --

3
4

QUESTION:

Do you think the request for a jury

trial was essential to the holding in Langnes?

5

MR. O'BRIEN:

Your Honor, I do, and the reason

6

is because it's the request for a jury trial that

7

implicates a saved remedy.

8

is what implicates a right under the saving to suitors

9

clause, which in that situation exceeds the interest of

10

The request for a jury trial

the vessel owner in staying in Federal court.

11

QUESTION:

As I read it, you're trying -- you

12

seem to be trying to make the tail wag the dog.

These

13

early cases say, well, you know, if you're in Federal

14

court, shipowner, trying to limit your liability, because

15

we've had a collision and there are 42,000 plaintiffs and

16

you've got to deal with this and just limit it to the

17

vessel, well, as long as you're there, we'll try out

18

whether you're liable at all.

We'll try out exoneration.

19

The only reason we're doing that -- they didn't

20

do it in England, but the Court says -- we say, from time

21

immemorial it was done in every other country, right?

22

So --

23

MR. O'BRIEN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

So we'll do it.

But if you're not

1

there's a single plaintiff or if there's an adequate fund.

2

I mean, the reasoning of it would seem to me to be, if

3

you're not here, and you can't get here because there's an

4

adequate fund, for example, there's no reason for us to

5

snatch the issue of liability away from the State court.

6

MR. O'BRIEN:

Justice Breyer, I think it's key

7

to look at Langnes v. Green and see in that case that this

8

Court stated emphatically that the procedure under the

9

Limitation of Liability Act was to first look at

10

exoneration and then, if liability was found, to look at

11

limitation issues.

12

QUESTION:

Of course that's true, provided that

13

you are properly in the Federal court limiting your

14

liability.

15

here, for the reason that you already have an adequate

16

fund.

17

there's an adequate fund.

18

we want to exonerate, but exoneration is there in case

19

you're in anyway.

20

My point is, suppose you're not, as is true

You have no basis to get into the Federal court if

MR. O'BRIEN:

Your only basis could be that

Well, let me state that

21

initially -- the initial claim filed in this case did

22

exceed the limitation fund, and so that at the time the

23

vessel owner instituted the proceeding, that was certainly

24

in play and, indeed, when the initial claim was filed --

if I remember the chronology right, you sought limitation,

and then a week later the Jones Act case was started.

MR. O'BRIEN:

You had your limitation --

The short answer is that we know

in this jurisdiction, where the State court suit could

have been brought, that tripping over a wire could lead to

7

a judgment in excess of the value of the vessel, and so

You're basing it on other claims that were

No.

I believe the vessel owner,

based on its experience, and based on its knowledge of the

situation, felt that an accident had occurred during this

voyage which might make its vindication under the

Limitation of Liability Act a realistic legal possibility,

There's no rule that prevents a vessel owner

3

jurisdiction attaches, and under the Constitution and laws

4

the district court is obligated to decide all those

number of things about the saving to suitors clause.

QUESTION:

Well, what about the practical

2

advantage of a plaintiff who thinks he's going to get a

3

better verdict in Madison County, Illinois, than he will

4

in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of

5

Missouri?

6

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, that is his right, to sue

7

where he thinks he can obtain the best verdict, unless

8

there's some kind of illegal forum-shopping going on, but

9

that really is what this case is all about.

10

QUESTION:

I thought so.

11

MR. O'BRIEN:

The vessel owner is entitled to

12

pursue limitation where it believes the purposes of the

13

act will be furthered, in other words, where it sees that

14

it has an opportunity to invoke exclusive Federal

15

jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights from some accident

16

occurring -- occurring during some voyage.

17

And if I may address a point from --

18

QUESTION:

Do I understand you, then, that the

19

vessel owner in every case where the sailor chooses to sue

20

in State court and not ask for a jury trial the vessel

21

owner can always pick the forum instead by filing a

22

limitation proceeding?

23

MR. O'BRIEN:

Unless he pursues a right, the

24

claimant pursues a right that is preserved under the

25

saving to suitors clause I would agree with that.

QUESTION:

Well, what -- you told me that the

2

only thing that's preserved is jury trial, not the Jones

3

Act claim, which is what I would have thought that -- I

4

would have thought, apart from entertaining your position

5

that it's not the Jones Act claim, and the choice of forum

6

that Congress has provided, but it's only the device of

7

jury trial.

8

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, it's really -- what it is

9

is -- let me refine my comment.

What I'm really saying is

10

that if the remedy is already available in the Federal

11

court, and what the Eighth Circuit decided was that if the

12

remedy's already available in the Federal court in the

13

limitation proceeding, there is no saved remedy to pursue

14

elsewhere, and so the -- I think the issue for this Court

15

is not so much jury versus nonjury in the abstract sense.

16

The question is whether or not the specific remedy

17

requested is available in the Federal court where

18

exclusive jurisdiction is found.

19

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't the remedy the

20

courthouse that's closest to my home that's most

21

convenient for me?

22

saved, the ability to choose, irremovably, the venue?

23

Why isn't that the remedy that is

MR. O'BRIEN:

absolute, and they never have been by this -- held so by

QUESTION:

They're always

But your position was that that

4

wasn't saved at all, because you could get a nonjury trial

5

in the admiralty forum.

6

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, I don't think the decision

7

whether or not the nonjury trial is saved or not is

8

necessary to this Court's decision, nor was it addressed

9

specifically -- in fact, it was reserved specifically by

10

the Eighth Circuit.

11

the reason is because under the rubric adopted by the

12

Eighth Circuit, if the remedy sought is available already

13

in the limitation court, the claimant's not allowed to go

14

back, and it was already available, i.e. a nonjury trial,

15

so the court below never needed to address whether a

16

nonjury trial was specifically a saved remedy or not, nor

17

does this Court need to decide that for --

18

QUESTION:

You don't need to get that far, and

So practically what the position

19

you're urging on us comes down to is that the Jones Act

20

plaintiff can get his choice of forum as long as he

21

insists on having a trial by jury.

22

on having a trial by jury, he doesn't preserve his right

23

to choose the forum.

MR. O'BRIEN:

MR. O'BRIEN:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Why would that be?

I mean, let's

suppose that a Jones Act plaintiff does -- could go -- he

could get into Federal admiralty court.

or he could do what he'd prefer to do, which is to file in

6

the State.

unless there's some Federal reason that prefers the

Federal tribunal?

He could get in,

MR. O'BRIEN:

prefers the Federal --

11

QUESTION:

Well, the Federal reason that

No, no, I mean, you're making both

12

arguments.

One argument is that there is a Federal reason

13

and the Federal reason is the exoneration, and that's

14

countered with the argument that there is no Federal

15

reason where there isn't an independent reason for being

16

in the limitation action, all right, so I'm taking the

17

other part.

there is no Federal reason -- he has the right come in the

door, but there's no Federal preference.

QUESTION:

Okay.

3

MR. O'BRIEN:

QUESTION:

And the second response --

But if you didn't, if there were no

5

reason favoring the Federal court, then would you say,

6

give him his choice?

7

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, I suppose that would be

8

true, except that Congress has spoken to the situation

9

when they've committed limitation of liability acts to the

10
11

exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.
QUESTION:

Okay, but if you're prepared to go

12

that far, then the case turns on whether there is a

13

Federal reason, and the Federal reason you say is

14

exoneration, so I understand that.

15

And then I'm back to the question I had before,

16

which I'm not sure I had a satisfactory answer to totally,

17

that really what this exoneration is is the tail and it

18

follows the dog into the Federal court, and the only

19

reason it's ever there was, historically in England they

20

did this, what the courts thought were absurd, to force

21

the shipowner to give up his right to exoneration in order

22

to get in Federal court, and our court years ago said

23

that's silly, no other country does that and we're not

24

going to do it.

9

fact that if the only reference to it is in the Federal

10

rules, that's ultra vires?

11

MR. O'BRIEN:

Well, my response, Justice Scalia,

12

is 130 years of decisions from this Court and others, at

13

least a half-dozen cases from this Court holding that in a

14

proceeding under the Limitation of Liability Act itself

15

now the court determines exoneration as well as

limitation.

17

to write exoneration out unless it were prepared to

18

overrule all those cases.

19

It would be almost impossible for this Court

QUESTION:

Well now, are you saying that in the

20

single-claimant, stipulated claim less than the value of

21

the vessel, we would have to overrule cases in order to

1

MR. O'BRIEN:

No.

No.

What I'm saying is, what

2

Langnes v. Green tells us, and what Lake -- which is the

3

single claimant exception case, and what Lake Tankers v.

4

Henn tells us, which is the multiple-claimant case, or,

5

excuse me, the adequate fund case, what those cases tell

6

us is that when the claimant seeks a jury trial that it

7

has been deprived of him in the limitation court, that

8

under those circumstances there is enough of a -- there's

9

enough rights there for that claimant to trump the

10

shipowner's right to be in Federal court, and they will

11

then allow him to go back to State court assuming that on

12

the one hand there's a single claimant, or on the other

13

hand there's an adequate fund.

14

But you can't look back at Lake Tankers v. Henn

15

or at Langnes v. Green and write out of the Court's

16

decisions the references to a jury trial being requested

17

by the plaintiff.

the moving force in those decisions that allowed those

19

plaintiffs to go back.

QUESTION:

That is what in my view was the, really

Well, of course, can't you just read

21

that as the -- this is a particularly strong reason for

22

vindicating the plaintiff's right to choose his own forum,

23

that in one forum he gets a jury and in the other he

24

doesn't?

25

think you can necessarily deduce from that the conclusion

that he wouldn't also have a right to pick the forum of

2

his own choice without that feature.

3

MR. O'BRIEN:

Justice Stevens, I don't think

4

we'd be here if the courts had routinely held that you got

5

a right to a forum.

6

held, this Court and the Federal courts, and what the

7

commentators have talked about for decades, is the right

8

to a remedy, and the right to a remedy does not

9

necessarily entitle him to go to a State court.

10
11

They haven't.

It

entitles him to a remedy.
QUESTION:

Well, he gets the same remedy whether

12

it's a jury trial or a bench trial.

13

That's the remedy.

14

What the courts have

MR. O'BRIEN:

He's seeking damages.

Well, the remedy, as the Court

15

stated in Shilendez v. Luckenbach, the remedy is the means

16

employed to seek the redress and in our view, and I think

17

the cases bear this out, a jury trial is a specific form

18

of remedy, a nonjury trial is another form of remedy.

19

It's the means employed, and I think that there's really

20

no question under the case law that a jury trial is in a

21

class separate from a nonjury trial as far as the saving

22

to suitors clause goes.

23

they both seek judgments, but in a different way.

24
25

They're different remedies.

Now,

If I may briefly address the rule (f) argument,
the position urged by petitioner that rule (f) should be

3

announce a general test for the determination of when a

4

Rules Enabling Act rule would be ultra vires.

5

decided that rule 4 trumped the Suits in Admiralty Act

6

provision requiring forthwith service of process on the

7

basis that the rule was purely procedural.

This Court in the Henderson case did not

It instead

8

But if I may, under rule (f), three of the four

9

items that petitioner urges are contained in rule (f) and

10

that mandate that it's a substantive rule are found in the

11

limitations statute itself, namely, who may sue, when they

12

may sue, and the object of the suit and so therefore, even

13

under the test that petitioner cites, rule (f) clearly

14

does not meet the standard of a substantive rule that

15

would be struck down under the Rules Enabling Act.

16

Indeed, the limitation act addresses those items.

17

And I turn again back to the original decisions

18

by this Court in the Benefactor, in the Norwich v. Wright

19

case, in which this Court had occasion to construe the act

20

and, if you follow the language closely of those decisions

21

the Court was not construing rules that it promulgated.

22

The Court was construing rules that it promulgated.

23

Court was construing the act itself, and the original

24

admiralty rules that were promulgated by this Court in the

The

1

1871, were rules, but they were in themselves

2

interpretations of the act as seen by this Court, and they

3

included the right to exoneration.

4

Now, if the limitation petitioner can come into

5

court, and if he can pursue a limit -- exoneration as well

6

as limitation, then by definition the Court has exclusive

7

jurisdiction over both of those subject matters and the

8

limitation claimant, in this case the Jones Act seaman,

9

can return to State court only if he demonstrates that the

10

remedy he wants is not available in the Federal court.

11

If there are no further questions --

and I would simply refer the Court to the quote from the

Benefactor.

3

reply brief, and the Court said that hence, this Court, in

4

preparing the rules of procedure for a limitation of

5

liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such

limitation to contest any liability whatever.

It's at 103 U.S. 241.

It's at page 16 of the

Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer both asked

point out that both the Fifth Circuit in the Fect v.

Murkowski case and the Seventh Circuit in the Joyce v.

1

MR. DRIPPS:

-- as Justice Stevens noted does

2

not require a jury trial, but it simply said that a jury

3

trial is one aspect that makes the State court forum

4

desirable, and that's part of the Jones Act remedy to

5

allow the injured employee that option of choosing either

6

State or Federal court, and whether or not to have a jury

7

trial in either forum.

8
9

To get to the respondent's not-otherwiseavailable test, this Court is going to have to say that

10

the saving clause does not protect statutory remedies,

11

particularly the statutory remedy afforded by the Jones

12

Act, which allows the employee to choose the forum that

13

the case will be tried in.

14

the saving clause was designed to do, and that is why this

15

Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's decision and

reinstate the decision of the district court dissolving

the injunction.

That, however, is exactly what
