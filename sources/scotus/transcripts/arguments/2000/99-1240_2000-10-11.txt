Mr. Sutton.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:

11

In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act

12

in 1990, Congress invoked its powers to regulate

13

interstate commerce and to enforce the Fourteenth

14

Amendment.

15

pass the ADA under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, doubt

16

anyone ever would bring such an across-the-board attack on

17

the law, yet it is precisely the virtues of the ADA as a

18

matter of Commerce Clause legislation, its breadth of

19

coverage, its exacting accommodation requirements, that

20

make it unsustainable as a section 5 law.

21

We do not challenge Congress' authority to

Now, before this Court has authorized Congress

22

to impose extra constitutional duties on the States, it

23

has required the Congress to show that the States brought

24

this loss of authority upon themselves first by engaging

25

in a widespread pattern and practice of unconstitutional
3

1

conduct and, second, by showing that the remedial

2

legislation is proportionate and congruent in nature.

3

QUESTION:

Let's --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, there were congressional

5

findings that there has been discrimination against the

6

disabled in voting, health services, transportation,

7

education, and so on, and there are numerous examples in

8

the legislative record, and those are areas of traditional

9

State control.

Do you think that those findings are

10

somehow false, or not relevant in some way, or that the

11

discrimination is just not unconstitutional, or what?

12

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, they're exceedingly

13

relevant, and they certainly sustain the ADA as matter of

14

Commerce Clause legislation, but just as with Kimel and

15

the age laws they refer only to discrimination in general.

16

They don't establish constitutional violations.

17

QUESTION:

Well, that's what I'm trying to press

18

you on a little bit, because the findings in some

19

instances are in areas that are under traditional State

20

control.

21

MR. SUTTON:

That's true, Your Honor, and

22

there's no doubt if we had a situation where Congress had

23

actually identified constitutional violations in these

24

areas of State control, Congress would have section 5

25

authority.
4

1

QUESTION:

Did the findings distinguish at all

2

between discrimination that was the result of the State as

3

opposed to, say, the county or the city?

4

MR. SUTTON:

Not at all, Your Honor.

There's no

5

distinction whatsoever between State, city and county when

6

it comes to constitutional violations.

7

local government and State government generically put

8

together, but the key point is in the ADA the age laws, in

9

the statement of purpose and findings, it was exactly the

10

same.

It's usually just

In fact, in the age --

11

QUESTION:

Why isn't it a constitutional

12

violation when one witness said, the Essex Junction School

13

System said they were not hiring me because I was using a

14

wheelchair?

15

MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, it might well be

16

a constitutional violation, but the fact of the matter is

17

that particular allegation was won by just one side of the

18

dispute.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, I pick that out because

20

the SG's brief is filled with references, and we have all

21

these amicus briefs that are filled with references along

22

the lines I just said.

23

Now, if I -- is it that I'm supposed to count

24

all those, and they have a whole lot here in a huge stack

25

of briefs, and count them all and then say, well, they're
5

1

just not enough, or there are enough?

2

200 instances like that be enough?

3

MR. SUTTON:

Why wouldn't, say,

Well, the first problem, Your

4

Honor, is that it wouldn't be a remedial section 5 problem

5

because, if those allegations are true, if there's no

6

rational explanation for what was done they all violate

7

State law.

8
9

They would -- all 50 States by 19 -QUESTION:

Well, they tell us, for example, that

a lot of States didn't have laws, to use this case,

10

involving cancer, or perceptions of handicap which really

11

weren't, and then they list all kinds of flaws in those

12

laws in these briefs, and I suppose they're probably right

13

in terms of the facts here.

14
15
16

MR. SUTTON:

But Your Honor, the risk is one of

constitutional violation.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, that's what I'm asking.

17

That's what I'm trying to get to.

18

constitutional violation where Congress has lots and lots

19

of instances of States that seem to discriminate against

20

handicapped people under instances where, given the

21

information in front of them, for some reason or other,

22

these handicapped people have not been able successfully

23

to avail themselves of State law.

24
25

MR. SUTTON:

Why isn't it a

Your Honor, those would be relevant

if Congress had made a second finding, which is just
6

1

critical and is what is exactly missing here, and that

2

finding had been, despite this conduct by States in local

3

areas of local control, the States weren't enforcing the

4

very antidiscrimination laws they had on the books.

5

Let's draw an analogy to the race cases.

If in

6

the early sixties every State in the country banned

7

literacy tests, all right, banned the very thing Congress

8

was trying to get at, it would not be enough for Congress

9

to say literacy tests are causing problems.

They would

10

have to make a second showing which is, the States are not

11

enforcing their laws on the books.

12

QUESTION:

So if, in fact, in the sixties, there

13

had been discrimination in the South, and we discovered

14

there was a State law banning racial discrimination,

15

Congress would not have been able to pass laws against

16

racial discrimination in your view without --

17

MR. SUTTON:

In the early sixties they would

18

have been, because I think in the early sixties you would

19

have been able to show that the States, those were shams.

20

They were statutory Potemkin villages.

21

nothing.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SUTTON:

And today?

They meant

What about today?

There's no showing on that front,

24

not at all, Your Honor.

There's no -- Congress did not

25

even look in the direction.

It's true they looked in the
7

1

direction of -- excuse me.

2

QUESTION:

Let me ask you, suppose we have a

3

real case or a hypothetical case along the lines described

4

by Justice Breyer, a very egregious case, a person

5

absolutely confined to a wheelchair.

6

get into the court hearing on time, or can't get into a

7

voting booth, and you have an insensitive State official.

8

In that single discrete case, could there be an action

9

brought under the Equal Protection Clause to compel the

That person can't

10

access, compel access to the court, compel access to the

11

building?

12

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I think you've got two

13

possible issues there, one what type of review, would that

14

be a rational basis setting, or because it's a --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SUTTON:

17
18

That's why I'm asking.
-- fundamental right, and so

therefore would you have heightened review.
I think there would be situations in which you

19

might bring a constitutional claim, but -- and I hope I'm

20

getting to your point --

21

QUESTION:

Would the court be wrong to say that

22

there's a quasi -- would the court be wrong to say there's

23

a quasi-suspect class here, or suspect class?

24
25

MR. SUTTON:

I don't think the issue would be

changing rational basis scrutiny.
8

The issue would be

1

whether it's a voting rights problem which gets heightened

2

review, but Your Honor, the key point on voting, access to

3

courthouses and access to voting booths, the ADA does not

4

correct that problem.

5

To the extent you think that was the

6

constitutional problem the ADA was getting at, it exempted

7

all --

8

QUESTION:

Well, what I'm trying to find out --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. --

10

QUESTION:

-- is if there's ever an equal

11

protection violation on a stand-alone discrete case --

12

MR. SUTTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

Mm-hmm.
-- where a State discriminates

against a person by reason of a severe handicap.

15

MR. SUTTON:

16

QUESTION:

That -Does that state an equal protection

17

violation, and if it does, why is it that the courts can

18

do what Congress cannot?

19

MR. SUTTON:

That's the line of inquiry I --

Why is it that the courts have more

20

authority here to limit that type of State conduct than

21

Congress?

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

It would seem that that's one

23

consequence of your argument, and I want you to address

24

it.

25

MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, I think if it
9

1

were -- if I were in the situation where I was saying the

2

courts had more remedial authority than the Congress I'd

3

have a real problem, because of course that's not what's

4

going on.

5

remedial authority.

6

The point of section 5 is to give Congress

But the point I'm trying to make on the

7

courthouse access to buildings point is that that's not

8

something the ADA addresses.

9

shows that by 1990 every State in the country had an

The Congressional Record

10

architectural barriers law that precluded the building of

11

new buildings that didn't have access.

12

QUESTION:

But you're willing to concede,

13

apparently, that it is a constitutional violation not to

14

make special provision in public buildings for those who

15

are handicapped.

16

MR. SUTTON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SUTTON:

23
24
25

I'm not willing to concede that,

Your Honor, because --

21
22

That is a denial of equal protection

of the laws.

19
20

Well --

QUESTION:

Do you know of any case that has held

that?
MR. SUTTON:

I don't, Your Honor and I would, in

fact, point the Court to Alexander -QUESTION:

When Congress was speaking of
10

1

discrimination could it possibly have been referring to

2

the statutory definition of discrimination?

3
4

MR. SUTTON:

Absolutely, and there's no doubt

that's what they were referring to.

5

QUESTION:

Is there any compatibility between

6

that and the constitutional requirement of equal

7

protection?

8
9

MR. SUTTON:

There's not.

In fact, of all the

Federal --

10

QUESTION:

11

from it.

12

case.

I don't know why you're running away

It seems to me that's the core issue in this

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton --

14

QUESTION:

Whether, in fact -- whether, in fact,

15

making special accommodation for those who are

16

handicapped, or the failure to do so, is a violation of

17

the Constitution.

18

one.

19
20
21
22
23

I think if it is your case is a hard

MR. SUTTON:

It's not, and there's no Federal

civil rights statute -QUESTION:

But Mr. Sutton, isn't this an

employment case rather than an access case?
MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, it's a challenge

24

to the ADA across the board.

25

abrogation --

There's just one

11

1

QUESTION:

But the particular claims are

2

employment claims, and is it not at least theoretically

3

possible that refusal of employment to a person because of

4

a handicap would be an equal protection violation,

5

regardless of whether the access provision was?

6

MR. SUTTON:

7

justifications for a decision --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SUTTON:

Well, if there were only arbitrary

10

Should they have ruled --

QUESTION:

-- you have no problem.
-- that nobody with an artificial

11

limb can ever have a job of a certain character?

12

could say that wouldn't pass the rational basis test,

13

couldn't you?

14
15

MR. SUTTON:

You

There's no evidence, Your Honor,

that there are any such State laws --

16

QUESTION:

No, but in that kind of a

17

hypothetical you would agree that that could be a

18

constitutional violation?

19

MR. SUTTON:

If there were -- no -- if all you

20

had were arbitrary justifications for that law, of course

21

you would.

22

equal protection cases.

That's City of Cleburne, and that's all of the

23

QUESTION:

24

it, in other words.

25

MR. SUTTON:

If there were no rational basis for

Absolutely, Your Honor.
12

1
2

QUESTION:

But there might be a rational basis

for refusing to hire a teacher who was in a wheelchair --

3

MR. SUTTON:

4

QUESTION:

5

If this Court's --- if only that the school is not

properly equipped to accommodate such a teacher.

6

MR. SUTTON:

This Court said that very thing in

7

a case involving the Federal Government, where it said

8

budgetary constraints alone can state a rational basis.

9

QUESTION:

How about Justice Stevens'

10

hypothesis, a man with an artificial limb turned down for

11

a teacher, just without any real basis for it, you know,

12

we're just afraid we might not be able to handle you.

13

MR. SUTTON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SUTTON:

16

think that would be a problem.

17

whether there was evidence of that going on in the

18

eighties, number 1, and number 2, were State laws against

19

that very thing not being enforced.

20

Well, if there -That would be arbitrary.

QUESTION:

I think that is arbitrary, and I
The question, though, is

Well, assuming there was evidence of

21

that kind of discrimination, I really don't understand the

22

argument that the fact that there are State remedies also

23

available makes it impermissible for there to be a Federal

24

remedy.

25

MR. SUTTON:

Oh, there can be a Federal remedy,
13

1

and that's why the Commerce Clause legislation is fine.

2

The question is whether you can trump --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SUTTON:

5

QUESTION:

No, I --- the Tenth or Eleventh Amendment.
Why couldn't there be a Fourteenth

6

Amendment Federal remedy, even though there also was a

7

State remedy?

8

main argument.

9

I don't quite understand the thrust of your

MR. SUTTON:

Because the very point of section 5

10

is to correct State conduct that violates the

11

Constitution, and if the States aren't violating the

12

Constitution, one --

13

QUESTION:

Yes, but the fact that a State remedy

14

exists does not necessarily mean that discrimination is

15

not taking place.

16

MR. SUTTON:

I agree entirely, and that's why

17

one has to look at whether the State laws are being

18

enforced.

19

QUESTION:

So I take it if you went back to

20

Justice Breyer's example and used the hypothesis of maybe

21

200 examples -- I don't know how many we've got, but maybe

22

that many were adduced -- and in each of those instances

23

Congress had said not only, we find here is an example of

24

an instance of discrimination, but Congress had also

25

expressly said, and we find that in this example there was
14

1

no enforcement of State law to correct it, and it had

2

matched its 200 examples with 200 examples of State

3

failure to enforce, do I understand your position to be

4

that then there would be an adequate legislative predicate

5

under section 5?

6

MR. SUTTON:

7

but I just want to --

8
9

QUESTION:

Yes, and I -- the answer is yes,

So that if you win this case,

Congress could go back and dredge up from its record its

10

200 examples and, if Congress said well, we now -- you

11

know, we've checked into this, and in each of these

12

examples there was no State enforcement, Congress could

13

then pass the act again under section 5 and it would -- on

14

your view would be valid?

15
16

MR. SUTTON:

No.

Yes to the first, but no to

the second.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SUTTON:

Okay.
The second problem with the ADA is,

19

it's unlike any section 5 law to my knowledge ever

20

enacted, and certainly ever upheld by the Court, in the

21

sense that it truly is a constitutional amendment in

22

section 5 clothing.

23

but every form of Government service that ever existed or

24

ever will exist.

25

It applies not just to every State,

That truly is evading Article 5 and the
15

1

requirement that two-thirds of each House approve a

2

constitutional amendment and, most importantly, the

3

States, three-fourths of them, get an opportunity to

4

change it, and that's exactly what would happen, and

5

that's what would be very risky about allowing that

6

hypothetical to justify the ADA.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, would you -- I thought we

8

were talking just about the employment section, those of

9

the ADA, but you're saying no, it's broader than that.

10

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, we've briefed the case

11

that it is all of the ADA.

12

provision that applies to, you know, title I, title II,

13

and title IV, so I'm not sure how you could slice it that

14

we're just dealing with employment, but if, Your Honor, we

15

were dealing with employment, and you had Justice Souter's

16

hypothetical, 200 instances, just employment, States

17

refusing to enforce, sure, you would have a problem.

18

QUESTION:

There's just one abrogation

Well, you would want to know,

19

wouldn't you, Mr. Sutton, whether these 200 instances

20

were, quote, discrimination, close quote, in the sense

21

that Congress used it, or discrimination in the sense that

22

it's used in the City of Cleburne --

23

MR. SUTTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I --- as that's different.
Well, I assume, Justice Souter,
16

1
2

that's what you were saying.

Yes.

I mean, absolutely.

But my -- if we're going to talk about this

3

solely as an employment case, which is fine by us, we're

4

perfectly agnostic about the issue, this case is Kimel.

5

mean, it's exactly like Kimel.

6

got, in fact, a greater gap between a statutory standard

7

and a constitutional standard, and an equally anemic

8

record when it comes to constitutional violations.

9

mean, even --

10

QUESTION:

It's employment.

You've

I

I

Well, the difference that I wondered

11

about is, Kimel I thought was ambiguous as to whether or

12

not a rational basis test applies, and I'd be

13

interested -- I know you're probably aware of the

14

argument, the SG makes it, that rational basis is a test

15

that courts have created in order not to intrude upon the

16

province of the legislature.

17

But there is no reason to have the province of

18

the legislature not intruding upon the province of the

19

legislature and, therefore, you don't need to apply that

20

strict a matter and should respect the congressional

21

judgment that, in fact, there is unreasonable

22

discrimination being exhibited in these States against

23

handicapped people.

24
25

I would like to get your response to that kind
of an argument.
17

1

MR. SUTTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's an important

2

point.

3

the-mill legislation, City of Cleburne is right.

4

that authority to enact these 50 State laws and the 30

5

Federal laws that protect the rights of the disabled, so

6

there's just no doubt about that at all.

7

There's no doubt that when it comes to run-ofWe need

But in the section 5 context you've got two

8

other issues, the relationship between this Court and its

9

final Marbury power and the relationship between the

10

Congress and the States, and that's why the section 5

11

inquiries are always different.

12

game.

13

just as Congress gets a presumption of constitutionality

14

in enacting these 30 Federal disability laws, so do the

15

States get a presumption of constitutionality that when

16

they pass these 50 State laws, 1) they're presumptively

17

good and 2) they're enforcing them.

18

You've got a zero sum

Congress' gain is invariably the State's loss, and

Now, that can -- you know, that's not

19

dispositive, of course.

20

States aren't enforcing them, they're just shams, well

21

then they're got a problem and, you know, that's why the

22

voting rights laws are --

23

QUESTION:

Ultimately, if it turns out the

I don't think the issue is one that

24

is encompassed by getting into presumptions of

25

constitutionality.

The issue, I think, that's getting
18

1

raised is one about, let's say the competence of the

2

courts to make judgments, particularly when we get into

3

the rational basis area to make sound judgments and it

4

seems that the courts are not as good second-guessers

5

there, perhaps, as legislatures may be.

6

But the fact is, Congress is a legislature, and

7

it is not laboring under the judicial disability as a

8

second-guesser, so why do we -- I mean, I go back to the

9

question raised.

10

Why should we apply the same standard

that we would if we were dealing with a court's review?

11

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I hope I'm answering both

12

questions.

If one is concerned about the institutional

13

capacity of the courts versus Congress in this area, the

14

last thing this Court should be doing in this case is

15

making ultimately these section 5 findings itself, okay.

16

So if you're going to agree with Justice Breyer

17

and the suggestion in your question, Justice Souter, that

18

there has to be a little more deference to Congress in

19

this area, the last thing the Court should be doing is in

20

a situation where they don't ask the right questions,

21

constitutional violations as opposed to violating a

22

statutory standard, number 1, number 2, are the State

23

24

thing anyone's --

25

QUESTION:

You're right, but this is just a
19

1

question of standard, and you're saying, look, whatever

2

standard you apply, be careful to realize that you don't

3

have, on your view, a sufficient predicate in the record

4

to pass muster on any standard.

5

I think we understand that, but why should the standard be

6

the same?

7

MR. SUTTON:

That's one argument, and

Because, Your Honor, it's not easy

8

being the Supreme Court and deciding what the Constitution

9

means in all these cases, but the bottom line is the

10

Marbury power rests here in this building.

11

rest anywhere else, and clever arguments about how

12

Congress needs more deference to find out when

13

constitutional violations really exist is just a nice way,

14

a polite way of putting the fact that they across the

15

street get to decide what the Constitution means.

16

It doesn't

I don't know how else to divide it, but that is

17

what's going on, if they can enact a law that applies to

18

every Government services --

19

QUESTION:

Can I ask you, on this very -- the SG

20

has headlined in his brief, S report number 116, at page

21

18, and in big letters, current Federal and State laws are

22

inadequate.

23

why wouldn't that be a finding that current Federal and

24

State laws are inadequate?

25

That was right out of the Senate report, so

MR. SUTTON:

It is a finding, it's entitled to
20

1

deference, and it applies to the Commerce Clause Article I

2

justification for passing this law.

3

to show there are constitutional violations, and

4

certainly --

5

QUESTION:

That does not suffice

The question is, I suppose,

6

inadequate to do what, inadequate to do the good things

7

that need doing?

8

MR. SUTTON:

9

QUESTION:

10

Absolutely.
Or inadequate to assure compliance

with the Constitution of the United States?

11

MR. SUTTON:

12

QUESTION:

13
14
15
16

Absolutely.
And the report doesn't say the

latter.
MR. SUTTON:
everyone to read it.

No, it does not and I invite

QUESTION:

That's exactly what's going on.
All right.

That's the other

17

question, but that's what you were answering.

18

this a constitutional -- if Congress finds that there are

19

all these problems going on with the States, and the

20

current State laws are inadequate to help these

21

handicapped people who are discriminated against, why

22

isn't that sufficient to show the problem that permits

23

them to act under section 5?

24
25

MR. SUTTON:

Why isn't

I hope -- I'm fearful that I'm

not -- I didn't hear the question, but let me try to
21

1

answer.

2

hear what you were saying.

3

You can cut me off as soon as it appears I didn't

But they've got to be constitutional violations,

4

Your Honor, and if they're not constitutional violations,

5

they haven't asked the right question.

6

QUESTION:

7

violations because --

8

MR. SUTTON:

And they are not constitutional

That's not the question they were

The question they were asking is precisely the

10

one Justice Scalia asked, which is, isn't -- is this

11

12

better job.

13

Of course we can do a

You know, I think in 1985 the Court issued two

14

decisions which seemed to me to get right to the heart of

15

the matter.

16

Not only was it --

QUESTION:

Why weren't they asking about the

17

constitutionality if they explicitly abrogate the State's

18

immunity?

19

MR. SUTTON:

20

looked through the --

21

QUESTION:

I've no idea, Your Honor.

Fourteenth Amendment.

23

MR. SUTTON:

24

QUESTION:

They could only do that under the

22

25

I've

That's exactly right.
So then they must have been talking

about the Fourteenth Amendment.
22

1

MR. SUTTON:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

That

2

doesn't follow necessarily at all.

3

have an abrogation provision, and States are free to waive

4

on their own.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

I mean, one you could

Well, Seminole wasn't decided until

1997.
MR. SUTTON:

No, until 7 years afterwards,

8

that's exactly right, but I've looked to the Congressional

9

Record trying to find instances where Congress was aware

10

of the section 5 inquiry.

11

Fullilove, Representative Dellums saying there's a broad

12

section 5 power.

13

I found two.

One of them cites

Fullilove is no longer good law.

The second cites Morgan v. Katzenbach and just

14

has a sentence that says, embracing the broader version of

15

Morgan saying that if there's an antidiscrimination issue

16

out there, Congress can remedy under section 5, but that's

17

not the inquiry, and as early as 1970 it was clear that

18

was not the inquiry in Oregon v. Mitchell, when the Court

19

invalidated Congress' effort to lower the voting age from

20

21 to 18 in all States in the country.

21

MR. SUTTON:

Mr. Sutton, you've made something

22

in your brief of the absence of a congressional provision

23

to treat the Federal Government, or Federal employment on

24

a par with private sector employment.

25

that, but I didn't see the connection between that and the
23

You emphasized

1
2

section 5 inquiry that's before us.
MR. SUTTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

It goes to the

3

second question, not the record issue but the

4

proportionality issue.

5

Congress purported to be remedying, in their

6

words, a national epidemic regarding disability

7

discrimination, and they decided that in order to do that

8

you needed money damages actions, which is really all that

9

is at stake here in light of Ex parte Young.

How can they

10

say that it's a proportionate and necessary tailored

11

remedy when they're not only not imposing it on private

12

business in many instances, but on themselves?

13

That just doesn't stand.

It's not only the

14

failure to lead by example, just direction, but it doesn't

15

show proportionality.

I mean, it proves our very point.

16

This was not needed.

It's not proportionate to the very

17

problem they were trying to correct.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

What is being imposed on State

governments that's not being imposed on private employers?
MR. SUTTON:

Money damages actions in public

21

accommodations requirement.

Title II applies to any form

22

of discrimination plus access to public services.

23

title III those provisions, most of those provisions are

24

extended to private businesses, and there are no money

25

damages remedies there, which really proves the difference
24

Under

1

between the State's ability to lobby, and private

2

businesses.

3

QUESTION:

But with respect to the kinds of

4

cases that we're dealing with, with employment, there are

5

money damages against individuals.

6

MR. SUTTON:

That's true, Your Honor.

I mean,

7

again -- but if this is an employment case, which is fine

8

by us, it really is controlled by Kimel, because the gap

9

between the statutory standard and the constitutional

10

standard is even broader in this case than it was in

11

Kimel, and then --

12

QUESTION:

Well, your -- I'm sorry.

13

QUESTION:

That's a proposition a little hard to

14

maintain, because in the age discrimination area this

15

Court has never found a violation of the rational basis

16

test, but in the handicapped area we've found a bunch of

17

violations.

18

MR. SUTTON:

19

against employment, Your Honor.

20

with employment, there are none with respect to

21

employment, zero.

22

QUESTION:

This Court has never found one
If we're going to stick

But there are a number of other areas

23

where there have been constitutional violations, but none

24

in the age area.

25

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I suspect, Your Honor, if we
25

1

reviewed all of the Court's constitutional findings there

2

would be cases in which an elderly person was a plaintiff

3

and won a constitutional case.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but not that it was

5

unconstitutional to place the discrimination on the basis

6

of that person's age.

7

MR. SUTTON:

I think that's true, Your Honor,

8

but I mean, if you can remedy constitutional violations in

9

one area by transferring it to another area, then we

10

really should talk about the entire ADA, and talk about

11

its biggest flaw. Its biggest flaw that it is a section --

12

it is a constitutional amendment in section 5 clothing.

13

It applies to every single form of Government service, and

14

if they're allowed to do this, they'll do it in every

15

area, rational basis scrutiny of all sorts.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you if you think the

17

congressional findings might have been phrased a little

18

differently if they'd been made after the Seminole

19

decision?

20

MR. SUTTON:

It's certainly possible, Your

21

Honor, and one of the best things I think that can be done

22

here is, instead of the Court having to engage in this

23

section 5 inquiry on the basis of the Government lawyers

24

after the fact, let them do it again.

25

But I will suggest this, Your Honor.
26

It is not

1

going to be as easy as one submits to say --

2

QUESTION:

It seems to me you're suggesting that

3

we treat the Congress of the United States as a trial

4

court and remand the case to them to prepare better

5

findings.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor,

The ADA would be invalid.

12202, Section

8

not at all.

9

12202 would be invalid, and it would be up to them to

10

decide what they wanted to do.

11

this Court invalidated the RFRA.

12

again.

13

In fact, in City of Boerne
They're back at it

They're entitled to do that.
I will submit that there is a bright line here.

14

It's constitutional violations.

U.S. Senators, U.S. House

15

of Representatives Members are not going to lightly find

16

States are violating the Constitution, but we want them to

17

ask that question.

18

We want them to look out, root out this type of invidious

19

discrimination, and if it's going on, have them ask the

20

right question, identify it, and end it.

That's the very point of section 5.

21

QUESTION:

May I go back to the remedy question

22

that Justice Ginsburg raised?

23

with respect to the damages remedy that you zeroed in on,

24

that that would fail the proportionality test unless the

25

same remedy were applied to the National Government and to
27

Is it your position that

1

private employers generally?

2

you're taking?

3

MR. SUTTON:

Is that the position that

Your Honor, it certainly helps our

4

case and it makes it a lot easier, but to be candid with

5

you, if they imposed this same remedy on the Federal

6

Government, I think they would still have problem,

7

precisely because it applies to every Government service,

8

but it just makes it --

9

QUESTION:

Well, it may not be sufficient, but

10

is it your position that it would be necessary to survive

11

the proportionality --

12

MR. SUTTON:

Not in this case, Your Honor.

The

13

breadth of coverage and the gap between the statutory and

14

constitutional standards are enough in this case.

15
16

If I could reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SUTTON:

19

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Sutton.
Thank you.
Mr. Gottesman, we'll hear from you.

20

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22
23
24
25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I want to begin by responding to what Mr. Sutton
said in his opening, that the ADA rests securely on the
28

1

Commerce Clause.

2

so what's at issue here is quite narrow.

3

No State would ever challenge that, and

Indeed, States are challenging in the lower

4

courts the Commerce Clause predicate for title II of the

5

ADA, and they are arguing that in light of this Court's

6

decisions in Lopez and Morrison that so many State

7

activities and programs are not commercial in character

8

and, thus, cannot be reached by the Commerce Clause, so

9

that were this Court to hold that the ADA is not proper

10

Fourteenth Amendment legislation, there is significant

11

danger that the ADA would be without a constitutional --

12

QUESTION:

But has -- Mr. Gottesman, has any

13

court bought that argument?

14

Garcia case to deal with, and --

15

MR. GOTTESMAN:

After all, there is the

So far there is one district

16

court that has bought the argument, Pierce v. King, 918

17

F.Supp. 932.

18

of appeals on appeals by the State.

19

The issue is now pending in several courts

QUESTION:

This would be an argument that could

20

be made only by the State, not by a county or a city, I

21

take it.

22

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, no, because a county or a

23

city -- if you take the Fourteenth Amendment away, the

24

Fourteenth Amendment argument -- the Eleventh Amendment

25

argument is available, of course, only to a State, but if
29

1

you say that the ADA is not grounded in the Fourteenth

2

Amendment and courts later hold that it is not grounded in

3

the Commerce Clause, then it is not appropriate

4

legislation directed to either, as we understand it.

5

QUESTION:

I would think that if you lose the

6

Commerce Clause challenge the least of your worries is the

7

States.

8

employ people, that they're going to be exempt.

9

You're going to have many more businesses who

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, except only -- title II

10

applies only to the States, and so it, losing title II is

11

losing -- I'm sorry.

12

and local governments, and if it goes down under the

13

Commerce Clause then State and local governments will not

14

be governed by title II.

15

QUESTION:

In that sense it applies to State

Mr. Gottesman, I'm not sure that the

16

record here presents much in the way of a title II claim.

17

I know the Ninth Circuit has said that all employment

18

disputes under the ADA are covered only by title I, not

19

title II, that title II addresses public services, and I

20

know the grant of certiorari covered both, ostensibly,

21

because the plaintiffs' cause of action appeared to

22

address both, and I think this Court probably hasn't

23

decided whether all employment cases fall under title I,

24

but if we thought they did, do we have to address the

25

title II issue?
30

1

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, no.

If you resolved in

2

this case, although the question is not presented, the

3

conflict among the circuits as to whether employment

4

discrimination also violates title II, and if you decided,

5

adversely to our position, that it does, the position we

6

advanced in the lower courts, then yes, only title I would

7

apply to employment, and only it would be at issue.

8
9

But we would hope that before this Court
resolved that important issue that has divided the courts

10

of appeals, that there would be an opportunity for

11

briefing.

12

In this case, the petitioners never raised an

13

objection to title II's application to employment, so it

14

never became an issue in this case.

15

Now, I want to turn to the merits of the

16

Fourteenth Amendment argument and we want to suggest as a

17

preliminary petitioners have never really acknowledged an

18

important body of Fourteenth Amendment decisional law,

19

which is that even when we're dealing with groups or

20

classifications that are covered by the rational basis

21

standard, it is irrational for a State to act with a

22

purpose that is irrational.

23

A number of Supreme Court decisions have held

24

that State action that rests on invidious prejudice,

25

irrational fear, false stereotypes that have evolved from
31

1

those prejudices and fears, desires not to be discomforted

2

by association with disfavored classes, patronization, if

3

that's what actually motivates a State decision, that

4

itself provides the irrationality which violates the

5

Fourteenth Amendment.

6

QUESTION:

And how does one usually determine

7

that?

I mean, I would usually consider it to be

8

irrational and motivated by prejudice when there's no

9

practical reason for it.

Doesn't it boil down to the same

10

thing?

11

rational basis for what's been done.

12

rational basis, you say it must be motivated by, you know,

13

irrational prejudice or stereotyping, or whatever.

14

You look to see whether, indeed, there's a

MR. GOTTESMAN:

If there's no

Well, surely it's the case that

15

when we see that there could be no rational basis, that

16

will fuel our conclusion.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

I'm not sure it advances the ball.

I

think the two boil down to the same.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

But the irrational purpose prong

20

of Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is not limited only

21

to those cases where it is irrational, where the decision

22

itself would have to be irrational.

23

That is to say, it's a well-developed concept

24

that a State may take an action where there could be some

25

rational reason for the action, but we determined that
32

1

reason is a pretext --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GOTTESMAN:

4

I understand.
-- that what really motivated

them was hostility to the class.

5

QUESTION:

I just don't know how you prove that,

6

except by looking at whether there is, in fact, a rational

7

basis.

8
9

How do you prove that -MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, that problem of proof,

Your Honor, is precisely why Congress found the need to

10

adopt prophylaxis here, and -- but I want to, before I get

11

to that, to lay out just what Congress --

12

QUESTION:

That puts the cart before the horse.

13

They have to have shown unconstitutional State action

14

before they can use the prophylaxis.

15

MR. GOTTESMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Correct, so --

And you're saying the

17

unconstitutional State action is going to be based upon

18

not the realities out there, whether there was a rational

19

basis, but whether, even though there was a rational

20

basis, the States somehow were acting out of irrational

21

hatred of the disabled.

22

MR. GOTTESMAN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GOTTESMAN:

25

QUESTION:

How do you establish that?
Well --

Did Congress establish it?
Yes, it did.

Tell me how.

QUESTION:

7

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Widespread.

Widespread.
Pervasive was their word.

What

8

they said in the findings on the face of this statute is

9

that there is pervasive prejudice, still, today, or still

10

in 1990, when they enacted this statute, there is

11

pervasive prejudice against persons with disabilities, a

12

history of purposeful unequal treatment, outright

13

intentional exclusion, stereotypical assumptions that are

14

wholly false and linked to prejudice, and they said these

15

animuses, or animi, have been aimed at a group which has

16

been historically disfavored and which constitutes a

17

discrete and insular minority.

18
19
20

There is a we they way in which people think
about persons -QUESTION:

That proves that prejudice exists.

21

Does it prove that State action has been taken on the

22

basis of that prejudice when there is rational basis for

23

the State action?

24
25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes, because Congress went

through enormous volumes of material that showed that
34

1

State action had been taken on the basis of that

2

prejudice.

QUESTION:

Let's not talk about State action for

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Let's talk about the States and
What findings did

Fair enough, Your Honor.

Here,

I will talk only about States and only about employment,
because that is the narrowest focus.
As the Government's brief shows, there was an

12

enormous volume of State discrimination across wide

13

sectors, really everywhere, which is not surprising if you

14

accept the premise that there are pervasive, widely held

15

prevalent views that stigmatize and disadvantage persons

with disabilities.

QUESTION:

Are there cases in the State courts,

8

or in the lower Federal courts which have accepted this

9

rationale?

10

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, there are cases -- because

11

of the prior existence of section 504, we've cited in our

12

briefs some cases that were brought.

13

courts don't reach constitutional questions, so they can

14

find it violates the statute, but the findings made in

15

those cases are that employees were denied jobs out of

16

irrational antipathy.

17

QUESTION:

Understandably

But if this is so evidently an equal

18

protection violation, why haven't courts for the last 30,

19

40, 50 years routinely entertained these challenges and

20

given relief?

21

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Because it is the burden on the

plaintiffs -- first of all there have not been that many

QUESTION:

You're telling me that over the last

4

30 or 40 or 50 years there have been numerous cases in the

5

courts where handicapped and disabled people have

6

routinely made equal protection claims and prevailed?

7

MR. GOTTESMAN:

No, that they have made claims

8

and have prevailed under section 504, with the court not

9

reaching, as it should not reach, a constitutional

10

question if it finds that the statute was violated, but

11

I --

QUESTION:

Mr. Gottesman, what are your other

20

function was to police whether Congress was overregulating

Second is the studies.

One of those studies was performed by

23

and local governmental officials, and it submitted a

report to every Member of Congress while the ADA was under

consideration recounting the findings of its own inquiries

of State officials in which it asked State officials, can

2

you explain why there is such a low percentage of persons

with disabilities working for you?

4

And overwhelmingly those State officials

5

responded, yes, the problem is that middle managers, the

6

people who make these kinds of decisions, the personnel

7

decisions in our State, are afflicted with negative

8

attitudes about persons with disabilities, discomfort

9

about working among them, myths and stereotypes about the

10

incapacity of people with disabilities to perform jobs,

11

things that have been -- and the report goes on to say

16

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

findings that these things are true, that all of these

19

things are animating decisions.

QUESTION:

describing was a report made to Congress by -MR. GOTTESMAN:

That's correct.

themselves, saying we have a terrible problem.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

14
15
16

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question was -- reference was made to the

17

caption in the Senate report, and it also appears in the

18

House report, of Congress' conclusion that the State

19

remedies were inadequate, a conclusion that was also

20

supported by the 50 State Governors' committees that

21

examined this issue, and the question I think that Justice

22

Scalia asked was, inadequate to do what, because that,

23

after all, is the issue.

24
25

Now, this is a case where a statute was enacted
before Seminole Tribe and before Boerne, and therefore the
42

1

paradigm that this Court has created for the words, the

2

precise magic words that we would now expect Congress to

3

use didn't -- can't, I think, fairly be imposed on a

4

coordinate branch of Government.

5

But the answer, Justice Scalia, to the question,

6

I think, is determined by reference to what the

7

legislative record before Congress, not only when it

8

conducted its eighteen hearings and amassed seven separate

9

complete reports in enacting the ADA, but also when it

10

investigated the problems that led it to create the CRIPA

11

statute, the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized

12

Persons, and IDEA, and others, but looking just --

13

looking --

14

QUESTION:

But General Waxman, it's not magic

15

words.

The whole point of City of Boerne is that when

16

Congress alters the Federal balance it must consider very

17

carefully the consequences of doing so, and to say that

18

it's simply magic words does not do justice or respect to

19

that very fundamental principle, and the Federal --

20

GENERAL WAXMAN:

21

QUESTION:

I absolutely --

And the Federal balance is altered

22

far more under the Fourteenth Amendment than it is under

23

the Commerce Clause.

24
25

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Justice Kennedy, I agree, and I

would say therefore that the question fairly put is
43

1

whether the Disabilities Act sweeps more broadly than

2

Congress could reasonably have deemed necessary to remedy

3

and prevent the constitutional problem it found applying

4

this Court's definition of the standard, and what it found

5

were four things.

6

It found, first, that there is pervasive and

7

widespread discrimination against the disabled, which is

8

often the product of hostility, overbroad and irrational

9

stereotypes, and deliberate selective indifference, the

10

hallmarks of unconstitutional intent.

11

QUESTION:

General Waxman, do you agree with Mr.

12

Gottesman that if the -- supposing there emerged a 55-

13

year retirement law, rational basis, relied on in Kimel,

14

do you agree with Mr. Gottesman's suggestion that if a

15

court could be persuaded that when the legislature acted,

16

that they really had it in for people over 55, that that

17

would be invalid?

18

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No, I -- well, I don't think a

19

court would -- a court would not find that invalid,

20

applying a rational basis standard, because this Court has

21

had -- has held that under rational basis review of

22

legislation one looks at whether there is a conceivable

23

rational basis that would support a distinction, and that,

24

in fact --

25

QUESTION:

Well, but now, I don't want to put
44

1

words in Mr. Gottesman's mouth, but I understood him to

2

say that sure, rational basis, but if you could prove that

3

although there was a rational basis for requiring people

4

to retire at 55, if the legislature that enacted that had

5

really been motivated by a dislike for people over 55,

6

then it would -- there would be a violation of equal

7

protection.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Justice, this Court has made clear that as a paradigm

Are you in the process of answering

my question?

13

(Laughter.)

14

GENERAL WAXMAN:

15

Well, Justice -- Mr. Chief

whether I also understood Mr. Gottesman to say that, I --

16

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION:

20

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

Do you agree with Mr. Gottesman?
I do not agree that a

21

legislature that could have had a -- a legislature that

22

could have had a rational reason for doing something

23

which, in fact, was motivated by invidious discrimination

24

would be struck down if this Court applied rational basis

25

review, but Cleburne, it seems to me, and the other cases
45

1

in which this Court has dealt with and remarked on

2

discrimination against the disabled points the way to the

3

correct resolution of this case, and before I -- I do want

4

to address that, but first I'll finish --

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, do you think it provided

rational basis as the foundation of review in Cleburne?

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

GENERAL WAXMAN:

In Cleburne --

Or something more?
Well, there is a great debate

10

about the answer to that question, but I will answer the

11

question on the assumption that the Court in fact applied

12

rational basis review, but what the Court explained was

13

that rational basis review is contextual, and context,

14

just like applying the proportionate and congruence test,

15

is contextual, and it requires a reference to the

16

historical context in which it arises.

17

And what this Court said in Cleburne is, we are

18

not going to look first at the facial constitutionality or

19

unconstitutionality of this statute.

20

require, in the unique context of a history of pervasive

21

invidious discrimination against the disabled, what this

22

municipality's reasons were.

23

it concluded that the -- that it must have been motivated

24

by an invidious intent, because the proferred reasons were

25

not, in fact, rational.

We're going to

And having looked at that,

46

1

Now, Cleburne, in the context of many other

2

cases in which this Court and Justices of this Court have

3

remarked on the history of pervasive invidious

4

discrimination against the disabled, provided --

5

essentially gave Congress the blueprint in which it acted

6

in this case, and here's why.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think Congress can by law

8

establish that the disabled are a discrete minority

9

entitled to heightened scrutiny in reviewing legislation,

10
11

or action by States?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Our argument doesn't depend on

12

it, but I think the answer from Cleburne is yes, because

13

in Cleburne what this Court said -- and I don't have the

14

exact words in front of me -- was that because

15

discrimination against the disabled is such a complicated

16

issue, that is, because there are reasons why differential

17

treatment is sometimes permitted and, indeed, perhaps the

18

Constitution sometimes requires it, that we have to give

19

broad deference to the legislatures, and we have to let

20

legislatures deal, as they more competently can, with this

21

difficult problem, unless --

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

We said the same thing in Kimel.

We

said, rational basis scrutiny, much legislative latitude.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but

what this Court said in Cleburne is, because of that
47

1

unique history, absent congressional direction, we will

2

apply, as a paradigm of judicial restraint, rational basis

3

review.

4

QUESTION:

Well, but -- I'll reread Cleburne,

5

but Cleburne said that in order to defer to the authority

6

of the legislature to pass a zoning law, that did not have

7

to do with the authority of the legislature to declare a

8

suspect class.

9

GENERAL WAXMAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That --

That's quite different.
And I'm not suggesting to the

12

contrary, Justice Kennedy.

13

O'Connor's question about whether a legislature could

14

instruct a court to apply a different level of scrutiny,

15

and the language in Cleburne that says access --

16

QUESTION:

17

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I was responding to Justice

And you think Congress can do that?
We -- I believe, as Cleburne

18

says, absent congressional direction we apply rational

19

basis for review.

20

QUESTION:

But I persist in the point that that

21

did not address Congress' authority and scope and

22

prerogatives under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

23

That's quite different.

24
25

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I agree that that's not

necessarily the case, but if I can simply point out,
48

1

Justice Kennedy -- this actually does go back to Justice

2

Scalia's original question -- that not only was -- I mean,

3

it is important, it is critical here to understand that

4

not only does the Congress find a massive record of

5

discrimination based on states of mind that are the

6

hallmarks of constitutional intent, but also that this

7

discrimination is the legacy of a not-too-distant past in

8

which Government practices deliberately isolated,

9

segregated, and withheld from the disabled fundamental

10

rights and the chance to participate in mainstream life.

11

When Justice Marshall wrote, in his separate

12

opinion in Cleburne, a statement that no Justice

13

contradicted, that a regime of State-mandated segregation

14

and degradation that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled

15

and, indeed, paralleled the worst excesses of Jim Crow --

16

QUESTION:

Well now, General Waxman, are we then

17

to look through separate opinions, dissenting opinions,

18

and say if the majority didn't contradict them they must

19

have been subscribed to by the whole Court?

20

done that.

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

22

QUESTION:

We've never

Not at all, Justice --

I'm surprised that you would simply

23

cite an opinion like that, as if -- unless the majority

24

said, gee, we don't agree with that statement, it suggests

25

the majority did agree with it.
49

1

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the point

2

I'm making is more broadly that Congress itself had before

3

it a record not only of what was going on currently, but

4

what had produced it.

5

prepared a report --

6

QUESTION:

The Civil Rights Commission

What you were citing was Justice

7

Marshall's opinion, and are you saying that Congress could

8

rely on that?

9

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I'm -- as an observation of

10

historical fact, Congress could certainly rely on it, and

11

he was not the only one in Cleburne to make that

12

observation.

13

Chief Justice, said that through ignorance and prejudice

14

the mentally retarded have been subjected to a history of

15

unfair and often grotesque mistreatment.

16

Justice Stevens, writing for himself and the

QUESTION:

Well then, one -- Congress could make

17

its record, I take it, out of statements in dissenting

18

opinions from this Court.

19

QUESTION:

I have to write more dissents and

20

concurring opinions, I guess, if I want to be really

21

influential.

22

(Laughter.)

23

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, so that I am

24

not -- I don't want to be misunderstood.

The Civil Rights Commission

does or not, the practices -- I don't think anybody -- I

20

don't think that Mr. Sutton would conclude that the

21

historical practices -- and I'm not suggesting they

22

persist, but we're talking here about a section 5

23

authority not only to deal with a pervasive current

24

problem, but to remedy the effects of past intentional

25

unconstitutional discrimination.
51

1

The remedy for past segregation and isolation is

2

integration, and that explains in part why the

3

Disabilities Act admittedly reaches some conduct that a

4

court applying rational basis review would not deem

5

unconstitutional.

6

QUESTION:

It's both.

It's that --

Mr. Waxman, is it really rational

7

basis review?

8

at odds with the -- with just anything goes, which had

9

been what rational basis meant.

10

I mean, Cleburne does -- the result seems

I thought that the Cleburne decision was very

11

much like Reed v. Reed in the gender area.

12

Court purported to apply rational basis, but came to a

13

result that didn't square with any prior rational basis

14

decision.

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That is, the

The one thing one can certainly

16

say, whatever words one uses, and Justice Stevens in his

17

concurrence in Cleburne, as I recall it, basically says, I

18

don't really know whether we have three distinct

19

typologies.

20

It just depends on how high the justification is and how

21

great the reason there is to suspect that something

22

unconstitutional may be going on.

23

I consider all of this rational basis review.

But it is clear that what Cleburne did was, in

24

looking at the actual administrative bureaucratic

25

decision, as opposed to the legislative choice, require an
52

1

articulation of the actual reasons in the context of

2

alleged discrimination in this unique historical area.

3

And what Congress did essentially was to

4

generalize what this Court did in Cleburne.

It took this

5

Court's specific inquiry in Cleburne in the light of the

6

Court, many instances in which the majority of this Court

7

has remarked about the history of discrimination in

8

Choate, Alexander v. Choate and other cases, and it

9

applied it to what Congress had in front of it, which was

10

on the one hand a body of half-a-dozen or a dozen

11

comprehensive studies detailing a widespread problem and

12

historic unconstitutional practices, and over 5,000

13

narrative accounts that the congressional task force

14

accumulated of individual instances of discrimination

15

against the handicapped, 600 of which addressed State or

16

local governments which for purposes of the Fourteenth

17

Amendment and State action have to be considered as one.

18

QUESTION:

What about judicial findings, a

19

question posed to your colleague.

expected, if this was a massive constitutional problem,

21

that there would have been a large number of cases that

had found the States guilty of unconstitutional action.

cannot be proved to a judicial exactitude.

1

QUESTION:

And how do you explain the results?

2

I mean, one could conceive of many bases that would uphold

3

that zoning provision, and yet the court not only didn't

4

attempt to justify the legislation, but held the

5

legislation to a rather stringent burden of justification.

6

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, I would disagree

7

respectfully.

When a Government lawyer comes before a

8

court, whether at the trial level or this Court, and

9

offers five explanations for a law that they all say are

10

rational, it turns out they're not, they're irrational and

11

driven by animus, they lose.

12

QUESTION:

I thought under classic rational

13

basis review the court was not only to listen to the

14

Government's argument, but if there's any basis it could

conceived --

about inmates and, if there's one area where maybe

4

interstate commerce doesn't go, it's to a prison, where

5

the very point of a prison is to keep people out of

6

interstate commerce, so --

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. SUTTON:

9

And I don't think that's a very

good example.

10

Unless there are any other questions --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Thank you, Mr. Sutton.

Well, if you have a minute, I would

like to go back to equal protection of the law.
Equal protection of the law might be violated

15

where a State official has a bad reason for doing

16

something, though he might have a good one.

17

out, a court probably wouldn't catch that violation,

18

because a court has to apply a rational basis test, but

19

that's for institutional reasons, so why should we apply

20

such a test where the institution is Congress?

As you point

21

So do you see what I'm -- I'm trying to get --

22

MR. SUTTON:

23

saying, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SUTTON:

I understand exactly what you're

Yes.
But to apply the test you're
57

1

suggesting is one that requires the overruling of City of

2

Boerne.

3

The very point of City of Boerne -QUESTION:

City of Boerne, if I find City of

4

Boerne ambiguous on this point, on the point of whether

5

it's going to -- whether a court would find a violation,

6

or whether there is a violation, if I find it ambiguous on

7

that point, can't I pre-crank in my institutional

8

considerations?

9

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

I would suggest

10

that's just the power to use section 5 to redefine

11

section 1, and that is what City of Boerne says, and

12

that's what Kimel says, also a rational basis case.

13

at the most, Your Honor, if you're going to talk about

14

individual decisions by Government officials, that's why

15

you need a pattern and practice.

16

distinction between individual officials doing something

17

and State laws that discriminate invidiously.

18

Voting Rights Act cases, versus City of Boerne, versus

19

Kimel.
Thank you, Your Honor.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

It's a very big

20

24

That's the

Thank you, Mr. Sutton.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
